1374731,5,B00004YKPY,This was a great OAV that had good fight scenes mixed in with a decent plot but together it made a very entertaining and visually stunning time. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for something where there is no risk of being disapointed,978134400,5,243,4.545454545454546
1374732,5,B00004YKPY,"Samurai X has really great artwork but what is more amazing is the Storytelling. It is unconventional and has something mysterious and dark about it. The dialogues are often short (but very good) because a single scene can say more then thousand words. You can ""live"" the story and that is the greatest achievement for a storywriter. To say it short: It's one of the best DVD's I've ever seen.",977702400,,393,4.628571428571429
1374733,5,B00004YKPY,"I've always heard of the Kenshin OAV's, and now I've finally gotten the chance to see it perfectly mastered unto DVD. It only contains two episodes which is sort of a drawback because soon as you finish the second episode, you'll want to see more. The art has been updated from the tv series, but you'll be able to tell who's who still. Old favorites like Saitoh and Hiko make their appearances early in Kenshin's career, and we get to see what happened finally. The relationship between Kenshin and Tomoe is interesting in how it develops. About the only complaint I can find is that the disc is only an hour long, and the historical background options scrolls too fast to read without hitting the pause button every once in awhile. And, well, there's the US voices, too. Not quite as intriguing as the Japanese voices.",971136000,,820,4.623287671232877

1374735,5,B00004YKPY,I have seen lots of OAVs and kenshin is the best I have seen yet. It has LOTS of blood in it but on of the best stories ever. In my opinon it is even better the NEON GENESIS EVANGELION.,969753600,2,185,3.65
1374736,5,B00004YKPY,"The Rurouni Kenshin OAV series, which this is the first half of, is about Kenshin's deadly history during the decline and fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  It was a horribly bloody time in Japanese history compared to the relative tranquility of the recent past, during which a legendary warrior, nicknamed the Hitokiri Battousai litterally changed the course of history.  This four episode series explains Kenshin's complex history, from the Shinsen Gumi to a woman named Tomoe, who tought a killer how to enjoy just living.  The TV series only gives brief glimpses of the Kenshin in this series, this is definately a MUST HAVE for any Kenshin fan.",969494400,8,648,4.981481481481482
1374737,5,B00004YKPY,"- SYNOPSIS - Nineteenth century Japan: a land torn by warfare and rebellion where small bands of soldiers seek to overthrow the tyrannical Tokugawa Shogunate. Enter Kenshin, a young orphan whose fighting skills were honed by the great swordsman Hiko. But Kenshin's soul is embattled much like the killing fields of Japan, his hopes for a new world peace at odds with his life of blood and killing. His world is thrown into further confusion by the arrival of a mysterious woman named Tomoe. Her kindness and attention show him a kind of life he didn't know existed. Can she help the assassin become a real man? Or does she hide a secret that could destroy everything he has come to depend on? Join the battle and discover the enemy within.
This would be a great buy for any anime otaku, especially that who likes action/samurai anime. To be warned, I would not buy this for the immature or weaked stomatched people, for this is a graphically violent OVA.

1374758,1,B00004YKPY,"Despite a generally poor reception, I had high hopes for this. Trust and Betrayal was, and remains, one of my favorite films, and criticism for the sequel seemed to focus on the melancholic nature of its ending-criticism which I easily chalked up to puerile sentiments of naivety. Not every story needs a happy ending. This film, however, seems to lust after suffering like some masochistic ascetic. The characters seem to court it as one would court a coy paramour. One character decides to go to China in order to ""share the suffering of the downtrodden"". At no point is it explained how he seeks to accomplish this. He is not shown fighting, he is not seen providing medical attention for the wounded, he is not seen doing anything. He is only shown slowly dying, a fate which he seems to take macabre pleasure in. There is perhaps honor in enduring the cruel vicissitudes of fate. There is perhaps honor, in bearing some measure of suffering on the behalf of others. There is no honor in seeking pain for its own sake, nor in portraying it. To suggest otherwise is to degrade all that is good in people. To suggest otherwise is to negate the value of heroism, and honor itself. The masochistic, guilt fetish themes of this film directly contradict the main themes of the first film, particularly the pleasing and universal maxim that ""Even when the world is in turmoil, there is no sin in seeking and enjoying one's own happiness"". It's not that this film is bad, (I would rate it as utterly mediocre). It's that watching this film actually detracts from it's illustrious predecessor. The experience of watching this film is akin to learning that a man who saved a child's life did so only out of religious hopes of salvation - while not directly detracting from the innate goodness of his deed, it reduces the admiration engendered from it.",1432339200,,1845,4.715170278637771

1374762,1,B00004YKPY,"This is the worst anime movie I have ever seen! Don't get me wrong, ruronin kenshin is a anime series this particular movie makes it bad. Not only did it destroy the establish characters and give them a crappy ending but it was ridiculously boring. This movie was a dumbed down clip show of the series. It didn't really have a story. The ending was needlessly tragic and depressing in contrast to the series message of redemption and hope.

1374763,3,B00004YKPY,"The brilliance of Samurai X was not to be understated (I will refer to it as the only true Samurai X film, because of its iconic place as the portrayal of Kenshin's origin.) As a result, the follow-up of Reflection makes for a rather dour accessory to what may be one of the greatest anime movies of all time. Canon or no canon, this is a great movie in its own right. However, the fact it does not fulfill the whims of the story's creator makes the entire opportunity of this movie to be the consummation of Kenshin Himura void.

Had I seen this growing up before I knew it wasn't canon, I would've found this the perfect ending for the whole series; however, it's a rather unfortunate article heightening original fixtures to perfection and lowering other fixtures to almost ill proportion. For example, the character of Megumi Takani is a sad and even disgusting departure from the character we see in the New Kyoto Arc, where she accosts Kaoru for her weak emotional will. However, this is the most tolearble Yahiko has become, but that is purely a side note. Sanosuke, meanwhile, is even more powerful as the charismatic brawler that we saw once.

In spite of all of this, the movie's lack of ability as a canon fixture highlights the ills of mere rights holding. This is truly a depressing ending for a character as engaging as Himura Kenshin, unless you don't read it as though he died. For the majority, however, that simply won't be a memo caught. Enter at your own risk.",1407715200,,1480,4.56015037593985

1374765,1,B00004YKPY,"If you've read the manga or watched the series, you know that Kenshin goes from a depressed wanderer plagued by the demons of his past to a man who finds atonement and wants to live. He finds his humanity, friends, family, and a home worth protecting. You also know that Kaoru is a fiery, compassionate, and fantastic moral compass who helps him become the man he does through unconditional love and stubbornness. She doesn't put up with his self-pity and when he does leave to wander, she follows him with the intention of bringing him back so he doesn't go back to killing or falling into depression. This OVA takes all of the character development of both Kenshin and Kaoru and throws it out the window. It's more like a ""what if these characters never evolved and Kenshin didn't care about his life"" movie. Kenshin spends the original series building a life and family, finding good friends, and discovering that there is redemption and happiness for those who earn it. This OVA's theme is that once someone has killed, they are doomed to a life of depression, restlessness, and self-destruction. Forgiveness and atonement are unreachable, and, until they die, they make everyone around them miserable even if they spend the rest of their life trying to fix their mistakes (which Kenshin made when he was an adolescent and spends his entire adult life striving for redemption). The creator of Rurouni Kenshin didn't get any input and doesn't agree with how this movie ends. Need I say more? Yes, it was beautifully animated, but it's unbelievable and disrespectful to the man who created the characters and his vision for them. I watched it once and wished I hadn't as I felt it was an affront to the original theme and tone of the series. If you must watch this, do so prepared and without much expectation. The characters and ending will disappoint you if you are a Rurouni Kenshin fan. You have been warned.",1394841600,2,1914,4.7507507507507505

1374778,5,B00004YKPY,"""I knew then...I knew that the world needed him and that I couldn't change his way of life - that it wasn't mine...it wasn't mine to change. But even though I knew it...even though I knew it, I wanted to chase him, to somehow keep him."" Himura Kaoru

Every journey has an ending, and with Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection brings to an conclusion Himura Kenshin's journey of atonement that he has been searching for since his final days as Battousai The Manslayer. Reflection strives to add on to the endings of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin and the manga series as well as giving fans of both a visually emotional yet satisfying ending to Kenshin's endless struggle for atonement for all the lives he has taken, which depends on whether you are a fan of Rurouni Kenshin, or have seen or read the anime and manga series.

For those of you who have read the manga know that at the end of the manga series Kenshin and Kauru are married and have a son named Himura Kenji, while Kenshin has given his sword to Yahiko, and Sanosuke has set out on his own journey throughout the world. Reflection picks up over a decade after the end of Rurouni Kenshin the anime series and manga. Kenshin has gone to the continent to help the fledgling Meiji government in the first First Sino-Japanese War, but after the war has ended Kenshin has not returned and is considered missing, yet Kauru who has aged over the years still goes to port every day in hopes of seeing her love. Kauru struggles alone in her and Kenshin's home as their son Kenji who is now a teenager, and who after rejecting his father ran off to train with Kenshin's former master Hiko Seijr.

The film follows Kenshin's struggle to get home to Kauru, and Kauru's faith and love of Kenshin. Through flashbacks viewers get are able to see how Kenshin and Kauru got to their points in the film. Viewers are also able to finally see the final arch of the Rurouni Kenshin manga brought to life as Enishi Yukishiro returns to seek vengeance on Kenshin for his sister Tomoe death. Through flashbacks viewers are able to see Kenshin's continuing struggle to find atonement even though he is no longer a swordsman. Viewers see even though Kenshin is content, and in a way happy with Kauru and his young son Kenji, but still wishes to find a way to help people and prevent the loss of life, but his struggle has also taken a toll on his body with an unknown disease. The name of the disease Kenshin suffered from is never named in the film. I have heard different theories with the main one being Kenshin suffered from a form of leprosy, which he passed on to Kauru, but I believe it was something else, and Kenshin's body just broke down from Kenshin pushing his body beyond its limits for so long. Kauru is the real star of Reflection has the film shows how strong a woman is, and how much respect people have for her, and her love and support for Kenshin, and the ending is just truly heart wrenching moment.

The story is beautifully written and emotionally moving, creating one of the saddest yet emotionally satisfying anime OVA's ever. Yet I can see flaws some will have with Reflection. I have heard some say they do not want to see a broken down Kenshin or how he dies, but in my opinion what we are given in Reflection is a fitting ending to Kenshin's journey and struggle to find atonement, peace and happiness. I mean really come on with the way Kenshin used his body how long did you thing his body could hold up. Just look at athletes from boxing, UFC, football, baseball and other sports. There is only so long a person can push their body to its limits a beyond before it starts to break down, and yet even with his body no longer able to perform in battle I can see Kenshin continuing his selfless battle to help people live and survive. Another flaw I have read people complain about is Kauru. She is a strong willed woman who matches well with Kenshin and is not afraid to enter into battle, and people have complained that she would have gone with Kenshin on his journey, and brought him back. It is a flawed criticism. Critics forget that Kauru was a mother as well, and could not just drag her son on her journey with Kenshin or just abandon him. Then as years went by Kauru's health was failing as well, and she could just not just go off blindly searching for Kenshin. That is just ridiculous, instead I can see her instead supporting the main she loves, raising and loving their son, and being the beacon of light in the darkness so Kenshin would always return home to her, and she proves that by the quote above that Kauru delivers in the OVA.

Perhaps the biggest flaw of Reflection is its accessibility. Unlike the OVA Trust and Betrayal, the Rurouni Kenshin anime and manga Reflection takes place in the future, and if you have not seen or read the earlier works you will understand the storylines or connect to the characters as those who are fans of the anime and manga making Reflection simply a love letter meant for fans of the character, and no one else. The story is aided by gorgeous animation done by Studio Deen that rivals any animation that is around today as well as a score by Taku Iwasaki who brought a triumphant yet solemn and uplifting score to Reflection that added emotional impact to each scene.

Reflection is certainly not for everyone. The film is certainly not for viewers who are not fans of the characters, and who have not seen or read the anime and manga, but for fans who loved the characters along with the anime and manga series we get a fitting conclusion to Kenshin's journey as well as the love story of Kauru and Kenshin along with getting a glimpse into the lives of our favorite characters and what their future looks like. Reflection delivers on all of those giving viewers a moving conclusion to the journey of Kenshin one of the best characters ever created along with beautiful animation, and a moving score. I highly recommend Reflection for those who are fans of the character, but if you are not or do not know about Himura Kenshin then skip Reflection for now, and instead I highly recommend you watch Trust and Betrayal, watch Rurouni Kenshin the anime series or read the Rurouni Kenshin manga series. You will not be disappointed, and will be introduced to an amazing character as well as being captivated by his struggle and emotional journey.",1375660800,,6361,4.517361111111111

This is an excellent movie. It has a completely different vibe than the series. It is very sad. The animation and voice acting are also different.

1374786,2,B00004YKPY,"I loved Trust and Betrayal. It was a little sad. But well done. After all this was before Kenshin meet his friends, and stopped being a wanderer-at least in the series. Loved the series as well. The series set up the characters personality. Reflections did not stay true to Kenshin and Kaoru's personalities. Even though the series was more light hearted, it set up the way all of the characters would act in different situations. Reflections was the most depressing anime I have ever seen. I know the characters were older, but they went against the things they would do. Love isn't always easy, but come on.
Kenshin would not have given up his sword. He would have continued to help with it. He was happy alot, and had finally found someplace he could call home. he did smile alot as well when he was home(not in this anime)-always doom and gloom. He wouldn't have kept wondering, leaving behind the one's he loved. Kaoru would have never accepted an injury just to prove her love. That is not her. Reflections was dark and dismal right from the beginning. Painting Kenshin as a severly manic-depressed person on a constant basis, nothing made him happy. According to Reflections the life between Kenshin and Kaoru was always in a depressed state, and he wandered way to much, hardly spending time with his family and friends. I know it was well recievd. I wanted to be entertained. Not feeling depressed and gloomy. It left me feeling funny. Needless to say I am giving it to a friend. I have seen all sorts of anime. But this one ruined the characters of Kenshin and Kaoru.

1374787,1,B00004YKPY,"Warning-Major Spoilers

First of all, it's important to know that Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator of the manga Rurouni Kenshin, did not like this movie. He did not approve the ending and has gone on record as saying that he wanted Kenshin to have a happy ending. Both the anime and the manga had the happy ending Watsuki wanted for Kenshin, and that is more fitting, in a literary sense, than this movie which is a betrayal of everything that made both the manga and the anime special.

It's not that a sad ending is necessarily bad. It's that Watsuki wanted to create a character with a dark past that redeemed himself and found happiness. In a sense, Kenshin makes a full circle in the manga and the anime. He begins life as the child Shinta, who seems to have been happy enough in his home with his family. Then his parents die from cholera, which must have been traumatic enough without being sold into slavery. The slavers are killed by bandits, along with their merchandise, but Shinta is saved by Hiko Seijuro, who renames him Kenshin and takes him for an apprentice to the Hiten Mitsurugi style. At the age of 14, Kenshin runs away to become an assassin during the revolution, then spends 10 years wandering after killing the woman he loved. It's a horrible life, but he did have the few years of happiness in his home with his mother and father. And Watsuki brought him full circle in the end to happiness in his home with Karou and Kenji.

Reflection doesn't just have a bad ending for Kenshin. The whole story doesn't make much sense when you look at character development in either the manga or the anime. Kenshin is not the kind of person who can walk out on his responsibilities, even if it may cost him his life. To have him walking out on his own son is to invalidate the character, in the same way that making Sherlock Holmes a womanizer or Mr. Spock a party animal would invalidate those characters. It doesn't even work in an alternate universe, because when strong characters are developed over years, the rules of the story that developed them apply more and more as the years go on. Kenshin simply would not walk out on his son.

Which brings us to Karou, another invalid character in Reflection. She couldn't even let him go to Kyoto to face Shishio without following along-the only way she would agree to Kenshin leaving her and Kenji would be if she had completely lost her mind and forgotten everything about her life. Karou was a strong, independent woman who understood Kenshin and his needs, but she never would have tolerated him leaving his family. If he even tried to leave, she would have packed up Kenji, grabbed Sanosuke and Yahiko, and gone after him until he returned home, where Megumi would examine his head. Anybody who has gone through the anime and/or the manga knows this.

The disease that Kenshin dies from is not specified, yet it's not hard to understand that if he had a communicable disease, he would not be trying to ""share his pain"" with Karou. He seems to transmit it to her by sexual intercourse, so the movie certainly seems to be implying it's a disease he picked up by the same method. Kenshin was presented as being a continent person during all his wanderings-the only woman he seemed to be with before was his wife, Tomoe, and the idea that he would suddenly not be able to control himself is in itself rather insulting to the character. Kenshin leaving Karou to sleep around Japan is just another layer of impossibility on the character created for this movie. Karou deciding that she would like to catch an incurable STD is beyond ridiculous.

Perhaps the most bizarre character in this movie is Sanosuke. He's living in China and finds Kenshin. He remembers how Kenshin was when they first met, and mourns the loss of his friend when he realizes Kenshin doesn't even recognize him. His solution is to go out and kill a tiger for its liver. He then puts Kenshin on a boat to Japan and doesn't give him another thought. After the battle with Shishio, Sanosuke had a broken hand and cracked ribs and carried Kenshin all the way back to the inn where the others were waiting. Here he just dumps his dying best friend on a boat and figures that somehow he'll make it back home. Sanosuke's desertion of Kenshin at the time he needed him the most is the saddest and most troubling betrayal of the whole movie.

I don't know what happened with this movie. I don't know how the powers that be decided to take everything that made Kenshin Himura a wonderful memorable character out, and put together a character that doesn't resemble the real rurouni any more than I do. I don't know why the wonderful voice actors and animators and composers, some of whom had worked on the real anime, agreed to be part of this. All I do know is that this movie might work as a stand-alone if you've never heard of the real Kenshin and you like to watch something dark and depressing. If you're a true fan, you cannot like this movie, because it's not the real Kenshin. It's something that bears his name, but was rightly rejected by his creator and most of his fans, and is best thought of as some dark nightmare that occurred in an alternate universe.",1315180800,8,5188,4.548179871520342
1374808,3,B00004YKPY,"I fairly enjoyed this video. The suspense it shows is great and the story is well written. My problems however with this movie are as followed. The few fights in this movie are really short nothing really exciting happens in them. But they have an important part in the story however. The next thing that didn't like about this movie was the time skips, it was really confusing for me to follow. When I watch this movie again I hope I will understand the time skips a bit more easily the second time around. It transitions from past to present to many times, I got confused. Over all I give this movie 7.5 out of 10. The artwork is really well colored and detailed and the animations is acted well, and as I said before it is very suspenseful especially towards the end. If you love romantic anime movies you will love this. If you prefer to see Kenshin in more action pact scenes like I do, I recommend the prequel of this movie Samurai X Trust and Betrayal or just watch the original Anime.",1295136000,,992,4.367567567567567
1374809,3,B00004YKPY,"let me start off by saying that i <3 kenshin. i'm a huge fan of the character and he has become a beloved, greatly esteemed, high-ranking member of my pantheon of anime protagonists. i read the manga first and it is, far and away, the best embodiment of kenshin and his friends (and enemies). the comedic moments are still there but the art and depth of character are conveyed even better on this paper medium than anywhere else. says alot about the creator of the manga, nobuhiro watsuki. so, if you haven't already, before getting this OVA or even watching the anime series, please read the manga.

moving on, as a fan and admirer of kenshin, this OVA sucked my soul out from my eyeballs, trampled it while wearing cramp-ons, then re-inserted it back through my tiny pores in its battered, beaten, shredded state and it took many, many days afterward for it to recover. can't say that's it recovered fully, either. i don't recall ever feeling both angry AND depressed all at once but this OVA managed to do it. quite a feat.

the animation, itself, is lovely. every scene is painfully and beautifully rendered, i have no complaints about the standard or workmanship. A+, 5 stars, etc. all the way. what i had a problem with was the actual characterization and storytelling. you know, the important stuff. the kenshin in this OVA is not our kenshin. the bulk of his story was his trying to find the answer on how to atone for his murderous past. well, he found it: it was to see the smiles of the most important person to him now (kaoru), his friends, and the ones reflected in his eyes (straight outta the manga, folks, from the jinchuu arc - which got butchered pretty well in this OVA). that being said, he would NEVER have left kaoru again, much less kaoru and their son. THAT is what i'm calling shenanigans on.

kenshin stopped being the battousai and became a rurouni to find how to atone. once he found out how to atone, he stopped being a rurouni. no more wandering. he would now fulfill his life by protecting the ones close to him. he no longer had an obligation to the government, only to his family and friends. for him to go to china, especially AFTER he had already handed his sakabatou to yahiko because the hiten mitsurugi ryuu was no longer effective in his hands, is ridiculous. the kenshin in this OVA is morose, sad, and a shell of a man. kaoru has completely lost her spirit. i don't doubt that she would be so crazy devoted to kenshin (who wouldn't?!) but i don't think she should have lost her self in addition to becoming a wife.

in the end, the bottom line is this: nobuhiro watsuki (creator) did not like how they treated kenshin in this OVA. he said it was crappy and that he thought kenshin, after so much suffering, deserved to be happy. i don't think all animes should have happy endings (i accept cowboy bebop's though i didn't have to like it) but if anyone ever should get one, it would be this guy! watsuki (and many of the fans) liked how kenshin ended up just fine in the manga. watsuki even had a very short episode included into the memorial box set released only in japan, that showed how kenshin ended up so that he could give kenshin the ending he deserved. if you want to see it, go to youtube and search ""rurouni kenshin last scene"" uploaded by ""konedanime"". it is under 3 minutes long but it is worth watching as the true ending to RK.

if you're all about collecting and must have everything related to RK, then by all means, buy this. if you love the character enough to want to keep him intact and true, then don't bother. i had never wanted to UNSEE anything...until this. well, this and when i walked in on my parents as kid. and if you can't decide yet, watch this OVA on youtube for free, it's all there. and then decide if you want to throw money at it.",1275955200,3,3808,4.426533523537803
1374810,5,B00004YKPY,"I grew up with Kenshin as my hero. I remember loving the small heartfelt filler of the first season, then being brought to tears as my ten year old mind fought with its own morality in the climax of the second. No matter how hilarious and light the series got there was always the backdrop of something much more complex, and that's what gave the series weight and validity. The series had a heart to it which few anime have ever achieved. It never over simplified the problem, it acknowledged the true ambiguity of the matters it displayed, and then the thing that pushed it over the edge was that the main characters pushed forward against what was wrong amidst all of the ambiguity. There was a line at the end of the second season where Kenshin admits that while Shishio and his ideology were definitely evil, Shishio though it was the right thing to do, and all we can do is follow what we think is right.
  This heart was wielded carelessly and without regard for just how beautiful it was often in the series, but it was still there in a subtle capacity. The series always second guessed it just enough to make you wonder whether it was still there. And then they would always give you a glimpse in the climax. Reflections indulges in openly displaying only the heart of the series, and wielding the full weight and connotations of the characters we've come to love. It faces the moral problems openly, and shows that Kenshin's life was not a righteous one. That peace for someone such as him is impossible, he knew that as long as he was alive he could probably save a life somewhere, that his only hope of ever dying a respectful death would be if every second was spent towards others, he had the responsibility of every life in the world on his shoulders. It was the thing that made the character interesting, he could never rest. And that ultimately there was nothing morally right about this self imposed burden, it was the kind of affliction described as insanity. And reflection takes the time to articulate this, and then watch him fall, continually. And that only in dying could he ever be freed of this burden. Reflections articulates this perfectly, if you have seen the series for what it is, you will be tearful by the end.",1252540800,,2244,4.538271604938272

  Trust is the story of Himura kenshin, an assassin. i won't give the story away ere, but know it it an actual story that makes sense. trust has it all: characters that make your heart bleed for them, animation that is extrodainary, and music that is unbeliveble.

1374815,5,B00004YKPY,"I see that the reviews on this DVD are divided into two groups: ones who love it, ones who hate it. So, maybe my review would be helpful to the new reader. Kenshin series has two faces to it. The first one, which is mostly reflected in the TV series is the legend of a Samurai, with utmost skill and best of intentions. The atmosphere is gay and uplifting and it's a great series for both kids and adults. The second face -or the deeper layer of the story- is the legend of the struggle of a man's soul in the journey of life, the story of repent, immense sorrow and indefinite pain. This side of the story is transparent in the TV series and only reveals itself in the trilogy of Trust, Betrayal and Samurai X Reflection. Unlike the TV series, and in harmony with the content, these DVDs are extremely dark and gloomy, definitely not suitable for children.
So, it's perfectly fine to just go after the TV series and never get to these three. However, if you can handle a bitter story but are looking for true depth then proceed.

I also saw comments on an over-romantic organization of Samurai X reflection. I don't say it's not true. However, I recommend taking it a little more symbolically than by its face value. It's the story of Kenshin's soul striving to overcome the pain, and the devotion of people who care about him. It's difficult to portray that, so the creator uses personification of love, compassion and pain in a mundane form, which, I believe, could look a little too base to some people. But get over the surface and you'll see the beauty.",1186617600,2,1559,4.451048951048951
1374816,1,B00004YKPY,"As many have commented, this movie does not feel like Ruroni Kenshin.  The tone is bleak and hopeless and lacks the magical elements of the series.  When one watches a Star Wars episode, you know it's Star Wars.  Here though except for the cross-marked scar and red hair, I would not have known it to be Ruroni Kenshin.

  The basic plot is that Kenshin wanders across China helping the sick while Kaoru waits for his return.  He is for the most part uninspiring and unlovable as he speaks in bland tones over and over about his guilt.  This may have been acceptable at the very beginning of the series but here at the end, it completely disregards his development and all the humanity (his humanity) for which he fought.  Please note as well that we're never shown any of the work that Kenshin does or the aid he offers to people; all we're shown is him feeling guilty or looking over the sea.

  Kaoru's plight is even more pathetic; basically she spends every day going to the harbour and then going back home and everyone asks her ""Kenshin didn't come back?""  She then spends a fair amount of time being sick and receiving care from everyone else.  How is this supposed to be heroic?

  The story is also told through flashbacks featuring some fo the best animation sequences I've seen, but again these snips are poorly sewn together.  In none of these sequences do I see anything to explain Kaoru's dedication or love; nor do I see Kenshin's peace or happiness at home.  The flashbacks are by the way the only part of the movie that contains fighting/action scenes.

*****************  SPOILER ALERT *************************

  The ending is not necessarily a bad one if it had been built up correctly.  Basically Kenshin walks back home; falls into Kaoru's arms and dies in peace.  However, having been bored and alienated by self-pity drivel in the first 98% of the movie, this wasn't as strong or potent.  I felt sad because this was the ""end"" of the character of Kenshin who I have watched and read; and thought he deserved a better send-off.

A better example of a noble ending is in the Lone Wolf & Cub Manga.

I suppose I should be added to the list of people who want to pretend this never happened.  I think it may have been Shinta (Kenshin's birth name) who died but not the legend Kenshin.  I hope they do release another Kenshi movie and say this was just a bad dream, the kind you have after drinking sour milk.",1180828800,9,2430,4.542725173210162

1374830,2,B00004YKPY,"When I first seriously started getting into anime and not those starter shows people suggest like Evangelion or Dragon Ball Z, I started to get into more obscure ones or just popular ones among anime fans and not the general public. Look at how Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon or Airbender are known even to people who don't even bother with anime. One of the initial series was Rurouni Kenshin except I probably watched the amazing Truth/Betrayal OVA's first (which I absolutely reccommend). Reflection, on the other hand, just seems so wrong on so many counts that it's hard to figure out if it was just simply bad ideas or just a genuine lack of care.

Essentially, this is the story of Kenshin's later life, burdened by the amount of people he's killed but also the lives that had to live on without their loved ones/friends. Showing re-animated clips of stuff we've already seen in a kind of flashback fashion, we see Kenshin unable to deal with his life, even though he has Kaoru. But Kenshin's fighting isn't over as Enishi, the kid seen in the Trust/Betrayal OVA's is older and he wants revenge.

The main problem with this is that it just doesn't feel like a Kenshin story. In Psychology class, we were told a story of a guy with a brain defect that made him unable to recognize his own mother and father, believing them to be imposters. Essentially, I wouldn't go as far with Reflection but not only the spirit is lost, character designs are a bit different but the whole thing just feels off, especially since characters don't act like their series counterparts. This would all be fine if the story was at least decently told. Nope, it mixes so much scenes from the series that it's hard to tell if you're watching a flashback from the series, something they made up or something new. In fact, there were times where I would've been lost had it not been for certain story elements.

Is the story about Enishi's revenge or Kenshin's later life? In a way, it's basically him unable to deal with things right in front of him. Even when he says he's happy with Kaoru and their new son, Kenji, he just buggers off and disappears. What happened to fun loving ""oro?"" speaking Kenshin? Not to mention there's Enishi. He was a whiny brat when we first saw him and even though he talks more intelligently he's still a brat. You felt like you wanted to slap him and say smarten up. Trust/Betrayal was nicely animated with lots of memorable images (Tomoe hugging Kenshin from behind is my all-time favorite) but while the character designs are immensely off but backgrounds are pretty well done, especially cherry blossom trees and Kenshin's fight with Enishi is great too.

Should you bother with this? Don't know. My dad was a big movie collector and he once remarked that even though a certain actor's movie sucked, he had to have it to complete his ""whoever"" collection. Same thing here. You might hate it, might love it but whether you want to have it for your collection is entirely up to you.",1169424000,2,2984,4.624528301886793
1374831,5,B00004YKPY,"Okay now then let me make clear that the first part of this review is a comparing the Director's cut vr. the normal. Also first off Samurai X Reflections takes place about ten years after the end of the manga and series and sheds light on what happens after words. The story is told threw Karu's eye, though this karu is completely different from the Karu in the series. However she is what you would expect an older Karu from the manga would be like. Also there is little if any gore in this movie.

Now then if you are trying to decide which one to buy, I would say buy this one for the simple fact it fills some of the questions the other version does not. For example you learn exactly why Kenshin gave up his sword, it also gives a better answer to what desease he is inflicted with. Also the flow of the story is smoother and things make more sense. The last difference is some minor corrections in grammar though there is  still the misspernounce a certain name. However if you have already baught the original version of the ova, don't bother buying this version. There are only about ten minutes worth of extra footage not to mention the end diologe during the end credits which is a rather let down. Second though slight some areas are missing their music but that's nic picking.

Now then on to the actual review. I want to say a few things first before I begin. I first off this is not for children, not that there is anything that any one but the most straight laced old biddy will have a problem with. It has more to do with that children just won't get what's going on as this is not a simple story. Second if you were hoping for a happy ending for our favorite wondering samurai, this ain't it.

As I said this story is told threw Karu's eyes and give the story a completely different light. The story is just as tragic and flawless as trust and betral, though the ending is somewhat opened for those the opptimist, make sure to watch threw the credits and have the subs on to get the true ending. Saying the story is wonderful is self appearent since Samurai X IS the best tragedy ever created.

The music is again flawless as is the English voice acting that is actually better then the japanese actors, I know end of the world stuff. Everything concerning sound is dead on.

Imagery is some of the best I have seen in the two hundred some anime series I've seen. Though the color sceme is brighter then turst and bestrayal they are do not harm the atmosphere but rather add to it. Every one has aged very well especially Kenshin.

Though I normally over look atmosphere I believe that it would be a mistake not to at the very least mention it. The atmosphere of reflections is perfect everything contriputs to the feel of sadness and regret.

In ending if you want to see how things end buy this dvd. If you just plan enjoy a good tragedy buy this dvd. If you such plan like a good story buy this dvd. I can't recommend it too highly.

Now then before I end I want to say a few things and clear up some missunderstandings I've heard from people. First off Kenshin wonders because he has to, he can not find peace and thus is forced to wonder. Think, a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do, he just has to. Second Kenshin doesn't return and is leaving in poverity because he has ammenesia and is a forgiener in China after the Chinese and Japonese war and has a deseases. Third Sonoaska doesn't return with him because he knows that that there is nothing more he can do and the best thing he could do to honor everything Kenshin has meant to him is to live his life done his new path, notice his trade make ""Bad"" sign is gone. Fourth why did Kenji leave home? Think about it his father was the main factor that brought down the last government and changed the course of history and was one of the greatest swordsmen to have ever lived, he just wanted to get to know his father and his strength. That is why Yoheko left Kenshin's sword with him for a night. To a samurai their sword is the physical embodiment of their ideals and soul, in away it is their heart. So in away that night Kenji was having a father son talk remembering Kenshin's last sword fight. that's it I hope it helped",1155254400,6,4201,4.287515762925599
1374832,5,B00004YKPY,"It always surprises me the stigma that anime has. Despite the fact there's fairly innocent anime shows like Love Hina or Fruits Basket, people focus on the ultra-violent ones like Akira or Evangelion. Don't get me wrong, the Samurai X OVA's are indeed bloody as well but there's also a poetic atmosphere running through the entire thing that rivals even the best Hollywood productions. Even though the separated OVA's kind of ruin the flow, it's still a memorable look at a man forever scarred.

Shinta was with a group of slave traders who were then killed by bandits. A man saves Shinta and takes him on as a swordsman apprentice. Renamed Kenshin Himura, he becomes the legendary Hitokiri Battousai(although he's never named that here), an assassin wanting to take down an oppressive government. He ends up meeting a woman named Tomoe who is slowly starting to calm him down and give him some humanity. But there's something in her past that connects her with Kenshin which is tearing her up.

Keep in mind this is a really violent film, even more so than you normally see from Kenshin. While nothing really gets cut off(at times), there's a lot of huge sword slashes and blood flows a lot. But it's not done in a kind of exploitative blood for blood's sake like other anime so it's better handled considering how violent it is.

The animation is quite fluid and really expressive which helps the film considerably, allowing a more poetic imagery to come across. The one thing that you'll notice but won't really pay that much attention to is the character designs. Kenshin, while still retaining his red hair and clothes, looks remarkably different in design to the show.

Now the question of whether or not to watch is obvious: a resounding yes. Whether you choose to watch it after finishing the Kyoto Arc of Rurouni Kenshin(do NOT watch the 3rd season) is entirely up to you.",1154563200,,1881,4.7607361963190185
1374833,5,B00004YKPY,"This OVA indicates how deeply its producers cared about the character Kenshin.  Yes, a happy ending will be somewhat satisfying, but it will not raise the series into the status of ""unforgettable"" or ""legendary"".

The production value is very high, the stylized rendering of the characters are very well done, they look different, but recognizable at the same time.  Contrary to one of the reviewer's opinion, I don't think Sanosuke is a bum in this OVA :)  I like the adult Yahiko the best, he lived up to Kenshin's expectation to be an honorable samurai.  He's an appropriate heir to the Sakabatou because he understood how Kenshin thinks, even taught Kenji about it.

Most of us are aghast when seeing the bittersweet ending, actually we shouldn't.  The whole series (manga/tv), although rife with humor and ""Oro"" moments, also clearly portrayed the conflicted feelings of a great person who can't help but getting tangled in the intricacies of the (sometimes sinister) government politics of a nation in turmoil.

Besides, another side of Kenshin that a lot of us forget is that he is a patriot.  Why do you suppose he went against Sishio? Remember when he's half-conscious fighting Sishio, he said that a new generation of warriors will emerge after him, that he had done his duty protecting Japan.  I don't think remorse is the only thing that pulled him to China.

All of us would like for Kenshin to be more respected at the end of his life by the people he has helped so much: the government (and by extension, the people of Japan), but the fact is, Kenshin never cared about such things, at the end, he got what he wanted.... ""Tadaima, Kaoru!""

** Spoiler alert **

I especially like the ending when Kaoru revealed that the cross-shaped scar has finally... completely... healed.  Seeing that, to me is more satisfying than ""happily ever after""-ending.

Also Kenshin was smiling when he died. Just like Kaoru wishes, that ""someday he'll smile to me from the bottom of his heart""

Another point that I think very profound is that while Tomoe is Kenshin's 'saya' or sword-sheath, the one who gave him the purpose and strength, it was Kaoru's love that ultimately healed him.

All in all, this OVA is a befitting tribute to a legendary character, fictional he may be, a lot of people's life has been touched by him.

I wish is that they create a new series about Kenji, and who's that girl with him at the end of the film (after credit)??",1151020800,8,2444,4.724056603773585

This Movie Reflection is a bit confusing at first but then gets even more confusing as the story goes on. WHY? Because the story takes place about 10 years after the fight with Shishio. The whole feeling has also changed where everyone of the series has changed even Kenshin. Kenshin has becomed very weak and confused when he was forced to fight the war in Shanghai, China and has come back to Japan pretty much helpless. Kaoru is the same way she is pathetic in the final hours of her life, she lost the whole willin to be strong when she gets a desease from Kenshin and even on the verge of dying. Yahiko has become much older and much stronger and is tryin to find Kennji (Kenshin and Kaorus son) Yahiko became the exact opposite attitude of the one in the series. Sanosuke has left Tokyo and is a free spirit is willin to help Kenshin in his tough time, Sanosuke was only in 9% of the movie so it was kind of dissapointing. When Kenshin left everything changes but also is a little stupid if you think about it. All in all its not great but it is good and worth the money.

The conclusion to a legendary tale... indeed, fans of the oav and the series will be confronted with the saddest but restful ending to the much loved kenshin character. In the beginning of this version which was edited to remove the pauses between parts was done perfectly to let the viewer see the movie with all its glory.

On this oav you will feel much of kauro's longing for kenshin and his unending quest of forgiveness for all the men he killed. His overwhelming guilt was so much that most of the time even during his marriage with kauro was spent wandering japan seeking atonement for his sins. Kauro being very supportive and loving wife asked that Kenshin share his pains and told him that he doesn't have to live his life solely for seeking atonement of his sins but to live also for his love for Kauro. Kenshin understood well Kauro's feelings and he reciprocated by marrying her. During their marriage and subsequent pregnancy of Kaoru, their life was full of happiness. More happiness came when Kenji was born. Kenji got his father's looks and strengths while his candid behaviour was from Kauro. But despite that happiness, Kenshin was still not contented. The ghost of the past still haunted him.

On his last journey this time outside Japan, his sword-bearing days took its toll although he didn't fought as Battousai. I will no longer elaborate the last portion of the oav as this will spoil it but one thing I can share you is you will not be disappointed in purchasing this dvd.

Hey I forgot to mention, if you watched the movie using english as audio the next day you should watch it using japanese audio, there are lots of contents here. Lastly on the third day, watch it using the commentary, here you will be enlightened on the crucial motivations of the oav and even laugh at their comments. The commentary is somewhat a shock-absorber for the feature.",1115078400,4,1979,4.6164772727272725

1374842,5,B00004YKPY,"Rouroni Kenshin has moved me beyond explanation, it sounds so weird being a thought, a figment of someone's imagination, however, that's just what it is.  It is the deep emotion of the creator that inspires us all--and inspired I am.

Kenshin was always shown as the strongest character, and not just physically, but also emotionally.  No matter how much fans desperately wanted to see some more warmth between him and Kaoru, there never was anything to really satisfy what we were looking for.  As years have passed along, however, and we learn that Kenshin, no matter how you look at him, is only human, we can see a little of his vulnerable side for the first time.  For a character such as his, one that is so fascinating for so many people, it could go either way.  You could, like I did, enjoy watching Kenshin come to terms with the strange and brutal truth of his life, or you could be angry that he did not go out in a blaze of glory.

The animation itself is gorgeous.  There was so much thought and detail added to the characters, they could almost jump out of the television and touch you.  In my eyes, everything was perfect, the atmosphere, the music, the dialogue.  Everything was as it should be, and though I admit to crying...yes, crying, I was also a bit happy to see a story that I have loved for so long finally come to a close.  Kenshin and Kaoru deserved it^^",1109203200,,1382,4.444444444444445

  When I first decided to see this movie I was excited to see some kenshin action, but it fell short of Kenshin action because it was so enamoured in the boring Love story. I don't mind a Love story but a redundant and depressing one just doesnt do it for me. Yes , he's sorrowful for the things he's done in his past but the dramatic music and the never ceasing depressed look to the movie makes ya wanna puke!!!!!!!!  The art was very good and the only action in the movie was good becuase the artist is a good one. The art is reminscent of Pat labor 3 (a Great Movie) which uses crisp and clear anime cells, although great art doesnt have to make a good story. Once you see the movie all the way to the end you've decided that this is not a fitting end to the Kenshin story, and seeking retribution for such an end is now incumbent to all kenshin fans that agree with me. If you're a guy and find yourself crying or shedding a tear , then you're not losing your manhood but realizing that depression is a symptom for everyone.

1374844,1,B00004YKPY,"Okay, now, any Rurouni Kenshin fan should have a very hard time accepting this ending. I have a lot of reasons and here are a few:
1)Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator of Rurouni kenshin, didn't write or appear to have any say in this, it seems as though Sony decided to inflict cruel fates on his characters.
2)Anyone who is a fan of either the tv series or the manga knows how Kenshin evolved as character throughout the series, facing his inner demons and repeatedly emphasizing the will to live, in ""Reflection"", Kenshin is presented as though he never lived through any of the experiences in the series, just so they can make him wander again in angst and have a tragic end.
3)Everyone in Reflections was out of character by far.",1107734400,20,729,4.572519083969466
1374855,2,B00004YKPY,"Beautifully done and very moving. I even cried at certain parts. The music is wonderful, the action and the animation is good.

HOWEVER, a very big but for me is the fact that I find Kenshin and Kaoru in this OVA very out of character. I think the makers wanted to create in Reflections something akin to Trust and Betrayal but it just doesn't work for me. I find it extremely hard to believe that the Rurouni in Watsuki's manga (especially after the Revenge Arc which was never animated) and in the anime series would do anything he did in this OVA. And that wasn't Kaoru either, she seemed more like Tomoe to me. I know real life can be depressing. I don't really mind a sad ending especially if it is nicely done. But this OVA is just so out of character I prefer to think of it as part of Kaoru's dream in episode 95 of the anime series.

The creator of Kenshin came out with some chapters in the Kenshin Kaden, 'Cherry Blossoms in Spring' and 'Yahiko's Sakabatou'. They tell the REAL ending to Kenshin's story. And it's definitely not Reflections.

Of course, if you're a RuroKen fanatic, the DVD is still worth buying. If not, stay away from it! Buy Tsuiokuhen instead (Trust and Betrayal OVA),  it's a must see. Or read volumes 17 and up of the manga, that's the Jinchuu arc (revenge arc), it tells an equally dramatic but a much better story of how Kenshin managed to atone.

Reflections (Seisohen) was well executed but not well thought out. They could have done a much better job by telling a truer story than this melodramatic, out of character rubbish.",1106524800,3,1564,4.473684210526316
1374856,1,B00004YKPY,"The one-star rating refers specifically to Reflection: Director's Cut. I would rate the original Reflection release--a two-part OAV--four stars. It had its content problems, as most Kenshin fans know. But I loved the quality of animation and the strength of the music, and I went with the content. I didn't feel ripped off, as it all seemed a worthy effort (even if doing a feature of Jinchu Arc would've been energy much better spent.)

The director's cut, however, makes me feel VERY ripped off. Why? It may provide about 14 minutes of extra footage, and further interviews with the Japanese voice actors; and for those who like the American track, there is a commentary track by the American voice actors. It also gets rid of the melodramatic dialog over the end credits. HOWEVER, it does an absolutely abysmal overhaul of the soundtrack once you get into the ""part 2"" material, ejecting some of the BEST and most exciting scoring for a rehash of music from Trust and Betrayal. The fight with Enishi is one such instance. In the original Reflection, this fight was electrifying, loaded with tension, the scoring absolutely wonderful. Well, that scoring's gone here. Why? Who knows. And the fight scene suffers terribly from this change. Other tampering with the music includes ""blanket tossing"" the opening theme around, and really ruining Yahiko's fight with Kenji. Such musical revisions all seem so careless, deflating what was previously exciting or touching or thought-provoking. They lack accent for emotion, and when spanning scene shifts, they ignore dramatic enhancement ... a terrible thing to do an anime that was originally, with respect to its scoring, nearly flawless. It also cheapens the Trust and Betrayal music, which I happen to love when it's used well.

The most I'll do with this DVD is pop it in for the extra 14 minutes when watching my original Reflection ... if I even do that. To be frank, I wish I had waited and gotten this thing used on the super cheap. The 14 minutes are worth something, I suppose, particularly as Saito shows up in one of those minutes; but nothing here is worth the full price of the disk. In fact, the sense I got from this was that nobody really cared what in heck they were doing, and that grates.

For those who are interested in either Reflection release but have not seen other Kenshin material (Trust and Betrayal; the Rurouni Kenshin series), the story here may confuse you and will probably not have much of an emotional impact. I'd recommend starting with the earlier Kenshin stuff. And when you're ready to see Reflection, go for the OLD release. Not this one. If you become a fanatic, you'll still want the director's cut. But seeing the original OAVs will ever be a far more satisfying watch. And by then, you may find lots of these director's cuts for sale used ... mine may be one of them.",1105142400,11,2858,4.781376518218623
1374857,5,B00004YKPY,"This movie does not introduce a new ark or saga, but instead it recalls Kenshin's past conflicts. In the beginning of the movie we learn that Kenshin has gone away from the Kamija Dojo and Kenji (Kenshin's son) went to train with Kenshin's master. Kaoru feels worried since she has no news of Kenshin's health and of Kenji's ground. While Kaoru faints she remembers all of Kenshin's past conflicts, and the last saga or ark is about Enishi's revenge on Kenshin because Enishi's sister died for Kenshin and her death left Enishi alone in the world. Enishi's saga is the original last saga and ""Tales of the Meiji"" is only a saga of filler episodes because the original author of the series, Nobuhiro Watsuki, did not write it. Around the end of the series we learn that Kenshin has a disease that always turns out fatal and Kaoru gets it because she asks Kenshin to transmit it to her through a passionate night because she wants to carry some of the suffering he is caring.

At the end Sanosuke finds Kenshin and helps him travel back to Japan before he dies so he can see Kaoru again, and when he meets Kaoru he dies in her laps.",1103760000,2,1130,4.458937198067633
1374858,3,B00004YKPY,"Ok, I know that not everyone is going to agree with me but here it goes. I don't beleive that many true fans of Kenshin will like this movie. I know that I was truely disappointed. Not only was the story line not well written but the ending totally ruined it for me. I am not opposed to sad endings but it just didn't seen appropriate for this character. I know that some have arged that the ending is realistic and in real life everyone dies but remember this is not true life. This is a cartoon. Besides not everything in real life has a sad ending. Anyways I thing that they should have stuck more along the lines of the magna, which is the show the true development of the story. I know others may say that the the TV series and first OVA may have differed from the magna too but it was only slight, nothing that completely changed the original story, at least not from what I have read so far. I haven't read all the volumes yet but I have read the summaries and plan on buying more of the magna, which show the true end, with Kenshin finally living in peace with his family. We can just imagine the rest if we so choose. THis movie completely alters and important element of the story, which Nobuhrio Watsuki, the creator of Kenshin felt was important, a happy ending. I think they made this movie just to make people stoping asking for more Kenshin by killing him off. Personally, I see this movie more as an animated form of fanfaction that Watsuki, doesn't even support. Why does movie creators always have to ruin the stories of our favorite heros? I hope that Watsuki, pushes for someone to animated the Jinchuu Arc to give the conclusion to the Kenshin story that true fans support. I watched this movie a few times and hated more everytime. They didn't even keep in line with the personalities of the characters. However, I do feel the animation style was nice. I highly recomend that people not buy this film or at least take it with a grain of salt. However I highly recomend that instead you purchase the first OVA Trust and Betrayal and the TV series, they are excellent. Even though much of the last season is not based on the magna, it the episodes I have seen are quite enteraining. More importantly, unlike reflection they don't hurt or butcher the original story. Also I'd like to mention that I strongly advise you not to show any of the OVAs to the younger fans of the Kenshin series. There is much more graphic gore (1st OVA) and sexual scenes, although not in any real detail or anything you can really see but it strongly implies things that parents probably will not want to be explaining to younger audiences. All in all, I'd like to forget ever watching this movie and tell others to just stick with the other movies, TV episodes, and magna to the series. You will end up much mopre satisfied with the story.",1101168000,8,2838,4.407619047619048
1374859,4,B00004YKPY,"I bought the Region-2 DVD of this director's cut before the domestic release of the original version, so this was actually my first exposure to it. I was forewarned by summaries and spoilers about how much of a downer it would be, but boy, is this OVA a downer. Although the animation is as beautiful as the first OVA (Trust/Betrayal), its dramatic structure is imho much weaker due to various factors.

The first half of Reflections is built around fragmentary recaps which can't be fully understood without prior familiarity with the original manga and/or the parallel first two seasons of the tv series. The plot then proceeds through the manga's Jinchuu Arc in a manner that's only slightly less cursory, and similarly requires foreknowledge of either those manga volumes (not yet translated by Shounen Jump as of the DVD's release date) or the Trust/Betrayal OVA, or optimally both.

And then there's the whole question of how the OVA depicts Kenshin's behavior after the manga timeframe; in many fans' opinion, he completely reverses the direction of character development that was shown throughout the manga, negating the peace he'd supposedly found. So while Reflections is dependent on its context, it simultanously undermines that context's core themes, which is a really irritating paradox.

A mitigating factor in the Director's Cut is that it adds some happy scenes that weren't present in the original version: Kenshin's second wedding; early scenes from his marriage including the birth and childhood of his son. Kaoru and Saitou also have a brief conversation about, er, something. (Maybe if I actually understood Japanese I could attempt a summary.) Nitpickers will be entertained to note that the wedding is grossly anachronistic, as the ""traditional"" Shinto ceremony wasn't invented until 1900.

Still, the animation really is dang beautiful. The recaps of key fights from the manga/anime are full of grace and power; in more introspective scenes, individal cherry petals or fireflies float weightlessly through the air. The character design is slightly different from either the first OVA or the tv series, but certainly recognizable and vital.

In the long run, while you kinda have to be a diehard RK fan to really appreciate this OVA, most diehard RK fans may end up in a maelstrom of pathos and indignation by the end. Watch at your own risk, and keep some tissues ready-- even if you don't need them for your eyes, other people nearby may need to stuff them into their ears.",1099785600,18,2499,5.070559610705596

Karou was not herself in reflection i know her love was deep for kenshin but she seemed unreal,her love was deep for him in the series but she was still the funny, joyful,loud swordswoman she always was but with more love in her heart because of kenshin. The same with yahiko megumi and sanoske. It felt like Karou turned into tomo kenshins first wife,a soft spokened loving caring wife who would never leave kenshins side. Im very sure karou would become something like tomo but in her own way. Plus after what happend in the series with yahiko taking kenshins sword to fight  gohei hiruma the crazed ediot who would stop at nothing to kill kenshin for breaking his thumb it looked as if kenshin would never let yahiko touch the reverse blade sword again. To end this it's hard to believe that all of the characters hardcore rurounie kenshin fans have come to love could change so much. In a way i don't know these people but overall reflection is a good story sad but good and the big change is it's only downfall.

It is really good animated,and the graphics are amazing.

the quality of the sound is pretty good, although the english translation is not as good as the japanese vocals.

The main plot is somewhat a little bit known, as the first episode drives you through the meeting and the realation of Kenshin and Kaoru, to the comeback from the battle with shishio (with some new -good- details).

The second episode, is mostly about what happens to our heros' lifes after the jinchu incident.

Some may say it is sad. But i think it is a very nice way to end a long-time series like Rurouni Kenshin.

It is overall a very nice DVD addition to every anime collector's collection, as well as everyone else who liked RK as a tv series or in mangas(everyone would like to know what happens after the TV series actually).",1092873600,,848,4.509803921568627

For those of us who are rk addticts, this is the final installment to the rk series.

It is set about 15-18 years after the series ends. Kenshin and Kaoru are married, but not as happily as hoped. Kenshin has given up his sword ( gave it to yahiko) but he still feels like his people are suffering and he must help out ( remember thats why he chose the life of chaos and became an assasin, to help the weak) So he frequently makes trips to far away lands to help out the people who suffer. Due to a mysteros illness he has fallen ill, but the ultimate price he had to pay was that he missed so many years of his marrige to kaoru and thier son kenji. Kenji resents this and even goes  master hiko in an attempt to connect with his father's true strenghth. Karou also waits for kenshin's return and is also very sick, but will kenshins poor health prevent him from comming back to his true love? Will Kenji finally connect with his daddy? What about yahiko, megumi, and sanoske?

15 years later , they are all back, but you have to buy the movie to check up on them!

The movie itself is one big flashback ( notice the disclaimer i wrtoe) making it difficult to understand the history behind kenshins story.

The artwork and the music is superb! Taku Iwasaki has done it again with the background music! The picture is absolutely breathtaking!

Even though as a fan i love/hate relationship the ending, I love the story line....

The animation is done not in the style of the series, but of the first OAVs, which seemed fitting to me because of the serious tone of the storyline. I could really feel all of Kenshin and Kaoru's emotions in this DVD, not to mention Kenji's anger. It does a nice job of summarizing the Jinchuu Arc, which was *VERY UNFORTUNATELY* never animated outside of the manga. That is my only complaint. It would have been so wonderful to have that story animated fully instead of being squeezed into this DVD. It is too short. Overall, however, if you love Rurouni Kenshin it is only fitting to watch it through to the end. If you love a tear-jerker, I strongly recommend this one.",1087344000,,779,4.571428571428571

My only complaint was that the flash-backs were a bit different from how the manga and anime went.  Hardly something to complain about.  I'd suggest watching Trust & Betrayal first, due to the flash-back of the fight againt Enishi.(which seemed to be one of the main events stressed)  As a loyal Kenshin fan it was painful to watch the real ending, him dying sick and tired and still guilty.  This is one of the rare anime's that doesn't have a completely happy ending.  One the other hand, we get to see Kenji for the first time, and Yahiko and Tsubame as adults.

There are two episodes in this, the first one is just a flashback the second episode is the real one u are supposed to watch.

1374897,4,B00004YKPY,"After watching ""Samurai X: The Motion Picture"" (""Rurni Kenshin: Ishin shishi e no Requiem""), where suddenly the Samurai X figure of the prequel ""Betrayal"" and ""Trust"" was back to the present, so to speak, and the Kenshin Himura of the anime series, I was wary of what I would find in ""Samurai X: Reflection"" (""Rurni Kenshin: Seis hen"").  Fortunately, what we have for the conclusion of the ""Rurni Kenshin"" saga is a hybrid between the two that, for the most part, works to provides an interesting ending for fans, especially in light of how the original series concluded.  NOTE: Be sure to watch the end credits after episode 2 for an epilogue.
Many years have passed since the battles of the Meiji Restoration during which Kenshin made his name as the Hitokiri Battousai.  Now, in the year 1893, Kenshin's second wife, the loving and devoted Kaoru, is pining away waiting looking out over the harbor for the return of her husband from the continent where he has gone to continue his quest to atone for his many sins of murder, including that of his first wife, Tomoe.  For all this time he has used his reverse blade sword only to protect those who need his protection, yet the peace and redemption Kenshin seeks have been denied him.  Kaoru mourns not only the absence of her husband, but that of their son, Kenji, as well.  Meanwhile, Kenshin has been washed overboard during a storm as he crosses the sea back to Japan, and wonders if this is how his life is fated to end.
The animation continues to reflect the higher standards of the ""Samurai X"" efforts and we are presented with more mature versions of the characters from the anime series.  The fact that the characters are fifteen years older and drawn in a more ""adult"" style, for lack of a better term, are appropriate but somewhat problematic because sometimes you cannot tell who the characters are, especially with the time jumps in the narrative.  Plus there is the larger concern in that I think most fans of the series are not going to want to believe that the story is heading in the direction it ends up going (and one that was apparently not endorsed by the manga's creator Nobuhiro Watsuki) as we end on a much sadder note than you would have expected.
On the one hand the finale is poignant, even more so with the epilogue, but on the other the point director Kazuhiro Furuhashi is making can be seen as running counter to the overall spirit of ""Rurni Kenshin.""  There is no middle ground here because ""Reflection"" cannot stand on its own and devoted fans of the anime will either cherish it or despise it.",1086566400,7,2578,4.599128540305011
1374898,5,B00004YKPY,"The first two episodes of ""Samurai X"" include on ""Volume 1: Trust"" take place in 19th-century Japan, when the land is torn by warfare and rebellion.  During this time small bands of soldiers rise up with the intention of overthrowing the tyranny of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Our story begins with Shinta, a young man who was sold into slavery after his parents died.  During a brutal attack by brigands, he is rescued at the last minute by a mystic swordsman named Hiko who decides to train the boy to become the most feared assassin in Japan.  Declaring that Shinta is too much of a child's name for a swordsman, Hiko names his pupil Kenshin.  Of course, fans of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" know that this red-haired boy will grow up to be Kenshin Himura, the ""Hitokiri Battousai"" (i.e., ""the man who slashes even as he draws his sword"").  But at this point our young hero's main concern is Tomoe Yukishiro, a mysterious young woman whose fiance is murdered by Kenshin and who encounters him by chance in Edo.
""Samurai X"" is a prequel to the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" series, although whether you see it first and then proceed to the series or (as I did) come to it afterwards, you are going to be struck by the profound differences.  As anime ""Samurai X"" is more sophisticated that the television series, but more importantly the violence is heightened and the comic elements that sometimes reduced ""Rurouni Kenshin"" to the level of an anime for young children is completely gone.  It suddenly strikes me that it is sort of like the difference between ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" in the second, larger work was much darker and more adult.  Here it is the prequel that is that is clearly not intended for younger children.  We know that Kenshin was once the ""Manslayer,"" but being an assassin is an even darker chapter in his life.  But Hiko is a believer in the philosophy of Hitra-Mitsunagi, and while we never hear of him (or Tomoe) during the run of ""Rurouni Kenshin,"" clearly he is the master who trained our hero.  Even if Kenshin is an assassin, there is at least the idea that he is engaging in a move towards the greater good by helping to clear the way for the new world that Katsura Kogoro and others plan in order to restore the Meji to power.
This DVD of ""Romantic Tales from the Meiji Era"" includes ""Act 1: The Man of the Slashing Sword"" and ""Act 2: The Lost Cat.""  You also get a trailer for ""Samurai X"" and a ""Historical Background on the Tokugawa Era"" that comes after Act 2 but which I would suggest you read before hand (the information scrolls slowly as opposed to having to move through a series of frames) as it explains the socio-political stakes at this point in Japanese history.  If you watched ""Rurouni Kenshin"" then some of this will be familiar to you, but you will end up with a better appreciation of the Meiji Restoration beyond the idea that this period is as pivotal to Japan as the Civil War was to the United States.  There are also character descriptions that will be of interest afterwards.",1085529600,2,3023,4.551660516605166
1374899,2,B00004YKPY,"I'm a huge Kenshin fan, but this movie was boring and sad.  I felt depressed after watching it.  It shows Kenshin as a sick elderly man.  The only parts I enjoyed were the brief flashbacks to when he was young.  Also, as a warning, the artwork is very different from Samuri X and the television series, not bad, but just a different style.  I think die-hard fans will enjoy the movie so I won't discourage anyone from watching it, but just know what to expect before hand.",1085443200,3,472,4.379310344827586

If you watch samurai x trust and betrayel you will learn more about kenshin as an assain. Unlike the series Reflection is more like the OVA's. This DVD shows more of kenshin and kaoru's love for each other they even had a son together KENJI.Well i am not going to ruin it for you GO BUY IT!!!!!!,1085443200,,395,4.142857142857143
1374901,2,B00004YKPY,"First of all, I'd like to start out by saying that the animation and the sound is excellent, hence two starts instead of one.
However, the story on this one is just kind of bad.  The first two OAVs were great, but I just couldn't quite stomach this one.
I was willing to accept, albiet with some difficulty, Kaoru's personality in this one.  She isn't the same strong boistrous woman who ran a kendo dojo by herself we saw in the anime and the manga, but maybe motherhood changed her.
I was willing to accept, this time with a lot of effort, the idea of Kenshin neglecting his family like that.  That one took a lot of effort, but I managed to swallow it.
But by the time Sanosuke showed up, I really couldn't take it any more.  My first thought was ""Where on earth has this guy been during all this?""  But what really got me was when Sano left Kenshin on the ship.
A little background for those who are unfamiliar with the anime or manga.  Sanosuke is probably Kenshin's best friend, he's willing to fight a tiger for the man.  So he just leaves Kenshin with ""a friend"" (whom we never see and doesn't really help Kenshin that much) because he has bussiness elsewhere.
What on earth could be so pressing as to make him leave his best friend, who is both suffering from amnesia and is so weak he can barely walk, practically alone?  Really, I'm curious, I'd like to know.  Because anything that would make Sano leave Kenshin like that should not be brushed aside lightly as ""business elsewhere"".
In conclusion, great animation, great music, but the plot is a bit too angsty/romantic for my tastes, and requires too much character butchering.",1083542400,5,1640,4.494949494949495
1374912,1,B00004YKPY,"(...)
The first half is quite confusing and very unexplainable, and weird.  All of the tension is built up for the second half.
The second half.  Apparently the producers felt they didn't need to animate the Jinchuu arc, why instead condense it to 10 minutes (maybe) and butcher the hell out of it.  All the readers who either can read japanese (which i am sadly not one of them, getting there though) or found dedicated fans who translated them and scanned them all, will see how wrong and incorrect the entire 'mini jinchuu' is.  And the thing about Kenshin ignoring his family to help people? (I can see how people would get that the written jinchuu arc (which should be animated), but in the animated series it never happened! So why ruin Kenshin?!) Kenshin would NEVER neglate Kaoru and Kenji, what universe is this from? I just can't say enough of how bad it truly is.
And the end? I mean come on, (alright i will give in to the disease, as it was hinted at throughout the series) but how could you end the famous Kenshin series, how could you honestly believe in such a sad, ending to such a great character? That is what put tears in my eyes, what they let happen to him, not the actually plot, fake 'reality' they tried to pull.  In conclusion, i totally deny the existence of such horrible ending (Sano and Megumi didn't end together? What's w/ that?!).
I think the collective group of Kenshin fans should protest and get those lazy producers off (...) and animated the Jinchuu, a trully fitting end to the great Kenshin series. If you are a die-hard kenshin, you probably have to see this, put take it with a grain of salt and join the few who totally deny its existence and the probablity that it could actually happen. Long live the Jinchuu Arc!!",1080777600,11,1759,4.501567398119122
1374913,5,B00004YKPY,"I hadn't seen any of the TV animes, so a lot of the flashback sequences were a big question mark for me, but I was with someone who had seen a lot of those episodes and they were able to fill me in. I had seen and loved the first 2 OVAs so this was perfectly familiar and fitting in tone. I am now totally in love with the Kenshin character and will probably watch all the TV anime episodes now because I want to learn more. I'm not a fan of the typical cutesy anime style, but since I love this character so much I want to see everything!
A lot of diehard Kenshin fans were disturbed by how this ended, but it didn't bother me as much, maybe because I didn't have a preconceived notion of how it was ""supposed"" to end. I thought the whole thing was very beautifully done and now it's made me a Kenshin fan, and I think anyone who sees this who's unfamiliar w/RK will become a fan too.

1374914,5,B00004YKPY,"This is the saddest thing I had ever seen. This was actually the first movie that made me cry. Just Kenshin's subborness to carry the weight on his shoulders made me so sad for him. The scenes of the weak state's he was in and the final scene of Kenshin and Kaoru finally reuniting made me cry and feel depressed for the rest of the day, and most of next. However, I would not have it any other way. Kenshin dying is the best possible ending, because he was finally able to find peace.",1078704000,,485,4.170212765957447
1374915,5,B00004YKPY,"I put off buying this video because of some of the earlier reviews.  I'm glad that in the end I decided to get it.  And I want to begin this review by saying that I have watched both movies and the TV series as well.
If the writer had had Himura Kenshin born at the beginning of the Tokugawa and not its end, this would have been a happier series.  Then Kenshin could have gone around the country righting wrongs, probably wearing a regular sword, and taking comfort in the belief that even though there had been lots of bloodshed, he had helped create peace after the civil wars of the 16th century.
But here is Kenshin, a noted swordsman, born as the era of swordsmen was coming to a close.  He is a man out of place in his time.  Not only that, the blood he shed has helped create a new government that does not live up to his ideals.  You can tell this from the TV series as well as the movies.
Now I suppose this could have had a happy ending, Hollywood-style, in which he dies happily at the age of 90 or so surrounded by his loving family and loaded down with honors from the government.  To achieve this, however, Kenshin would have had to live through the 1920s and 1930s and suffer even greater disappointment.  After all, the promise of the Meiji period, which was far from perfect, was not realized in the early 20th century.  So when I first began watching the TV series, I never imagined a perfectly happy ending, unlike some of the other reviewers of this film.
So here's a guy who helped create a new government by killing its opponents.  Then the new government turns out to be imperfect.  What to do?  Defend the weak against oppression, I guess we can say, and that is what he does in the TV series, wearing a reverse-bladed sword so that he need not kill again. The TV series also makes it clear that Kenshin feels great remorse for the killing that he has done in the past.  How can there be a happy ending unless that remorse is lifted from his spirit?
In Reflection, he is 15 years older.  Unlike some earlier reviewers, I don't want to put a lot of the plot into this review.  The only drawback I find is that there are too many flashbacks.
I do want to talk about the ending - that is, the ending before the credits, the ending for Kenshin and Kaoru, as there is another ending for the minor characters after the credits.  Yes, it is sad.  But I think that it is a magnificent ending:  a sign appears (or rather disappears) that indicates that Kenshin has achieved the redemption that he had sought for so long.  I do not believe that any ending could have been more powerful than this one.",1078444800,2,2615,4.3
1374916,1,B00004YKPY,"Okay, to begin with, i haven't purchased this part yet. But i've read enough to know how bad this is. i've seen the OVAs and the series. Nobuhiro Watsuki, i hope you see this. You're an awesome guy, but why did you let some goof take over the series and end this wonderful story just like that? The OVAs were good, no complaints. The motion picture was quite a bit boring, but it's ok. But the stuff after the Kyoto Arc in the series, sheesh!! They're awful!! Things don't connect. It's like a whole new story. A crappy one! I even taped the DVDs of the episodes after the Kyoto Arc to the casing and wrote ""Do not view."" Now this? Kenshin dying of some stupid disease? He deserves more than that. Watsuki should've taken care of that part and left us an open ending. Please think of this Watsuki, are you there?!?!?

1374919,3,B00004YKPY,"There doesn't seam to be any middle ground on this one. Basically almost the entire film is a (very) edited repeat of what happened in the books. (Yes the books, not TV series.  Other people have stated that only the beginning is a repeat and then there's another story. NO - it's the story of the book) Which isn't very good, if we didn't know the plot already it's really hard to follow on top of which it might be closer then the TV-series but they still changed a few things. Also the ending is completely made up.
But let's review it for what it is 'Another Kenshin Movie'. The animation is on the same standard as before and the soundtrack it ok. For those that have been waiting for a kiss between Kenshin and Kaoru this is a must, since it's the only time it will ever happen.
Other then the repeating of the story there isn't a lot of plot to this.  Kenshin is married to Kaoru (with a son - who goes to train with Kenshin's old master) and leaves her on various journeys.  he becomes very ill  (so does Kaoru because she wants to share his pain?!) and Kaoru constantly awaits his return...
If you like Kenshin and know the story and go ahead and by it.  But if this is your first introduction to Kenshin (even if you have seen Trust and Betrayal) then I would advise against it.  All in all it is a disappointing conclusion.",1073260800,,1334,4.273809523809524
1374930,4,B00004YKPY,"By itself this was a very good episode.  The animation and music soundtrack was very well done and I liked seeing what became of all the other characters.  The story was very emotional and even made me cry.  However, the thought of Kenshin dying from something like leprosy seems a little off.  He was an invincible warrior and a very strong man.  If he had to die, I would have liked him to have a more noble death.",1072828800,,416,4.282051282051282
1374931,1,B00004YKPY,"My first reaction upon watching this was total denial.  Then there was anger, 'How could they do that to MY Kenshin?!!'  Then I tried to accept, but that didn't work.  So, I Googled for ""Nobuhiro Watsuki interview"" found out that the original creator of Rurouni Kenshin didn't have anything to do with it & was personally in favor of happy endings--I was vastly relieved.  It's confirmed.  It really didn't happen.
For those who're confused, it happened like this:
-First there was a comic series by Nobushiro Watsuki called Rurouni Kenshin--it eventually came to 28 volumes.
-Then there was an anime based on the comic, also called Rurouni Kenshin (96 episodes).  The first half of the series comes directly from the comic, the second half deviates quite a bit.
-Then there was the first OAV, the US title is Samurai X: Trust & Betrayal.  This was based on Kenshin's backstory (ten years before the beginning of the tv series) as it was told in the comic--it's just a tad more serious and the art is a little different.
-Finally, there is this monstrosity.  It flashes back to past incidents from the TV show/comic--but retells them all so that they're more depressing.  Then it tacks on an original ending that, in my opinion, contradicts the entire point/theme of the previous 96 episodes & 28 volumes of story.
Basically, there's very little new story in this movie--it's mostly just a rehash of what's gone before.  The little that was new, I found to be poorly thought out and not in line with the rest of the series.",1072828800,13,1523,4.734848484848484

It's very emotional, Kenshin and Kaour's relationship was fully explored and explained, and the animation is on par with the OVAs. The problem I have is with its ending, which should not have turned out the way it did, at least in my humble opinion. To me, Kenshin is a legendary warrior and the ending should have shown that, instead we get a rather pathetic and broken man. I never ever wanted to see him that way and found it disheartening. Also, I am not Japanese and do not fully understand its culture so I found Kaoru's decision to be unrealistic and incomprehensible. Of course I can't ruin the story and tell you what she did. I would also like to have seen more new footage instead of a re-telling of the TV series. Once again I have to say this is a very good piece of work, but I would rather detach it from any association with the OVAs, which were wonderful to say the least. All in all, I felt this was a very sad and disappointing ending for such a great series. Shinta deserved more.",1072828800,3,1140,4.253456221198157

I'v read the manga verson and have some of the cartoon's ones and I have trust and betray on dvd. I cried at the end. The ending semed right. Kenshin died in the arms of the one he loved and he was finaly happy. If you love Kenshin then you must rent of buy this and you will see for yourself how Kenshin and Karou loved each other and how Karou wanted to share his pain.,1068854400,,538,3.990740740740741
1374936,5,B00004YKPY,"I'm a long time Kenshin fan so I was really worried that I would hate this OVA because I had heard that he dies at the end.  Even though he did die, it was not the horribly depressing tearjerker that I expected it to be.
It's the story of Kaoru, who is also sick, reminiscing on her life with Kenshin. The artwork is the best that I have ever seen in an anime film.  There are several flashbacks to things that took place in the series.  They also do a flashback to the incident with Enishi.  I thought that this was a great scene, beautifully drawn and good dialog. Enishi was a much better villain than Shishio because he wasn't completely bad, he had a deep hurt and sadness in his soul over the death of his sister and it helped to humanize him.  He wasn't just a blood-thirsty monster like Shishio.
There are also some really nice scenes between Kenshin and Kaoru where you really get to see them express their feelings for each other.  Unlike the series, where you were constantly waiting to see some spark of love or romantic attraction, something beyond just friendship.  Finally you see them share some really sweet and tender moments.
This film was not only beautifully animated but also done with great respect to the story line and characters.  The great thing about the Kenshin series is that it (for the most part) was very realistic compared to the typical anime.  With the exception of parts of the last season, there were never any monsters or science fiction elements. It was about real life and in real life people eventually die.  I think that Kenshin's death was fitting for his character.  He did not die in a sword battle like a warrior, because in his heart he wasn't a warrior.  He was a gentle caring man that died peacefully in the arms of the woman he loved, the woman that loved him more than she loved her own life.  I can't think of a better way to pass from this life to the next.  I did shed a tear at the end of this film, not out of sadness but happiness that Kenshin's atonement was finally over and his soul was finally at peace.  It's truly a remarkable piece of anime that every Kenshin fan must see and even a non-fan could enjoy.

First thing's first. If you don't absolutely love Kenshin, you probably won't get what's behind all of this. If you aren't a die hard fan, it won't touch you. You have to know the characters and the show before it to really understand it.

Is not like the ending other great animes have (Ranma).

1374961,4,B00004YKPY,"The feature runs about an hour long, and some of it is even rehashed stuff from the Kenshin TV series. The action sequences are very short, and lacking the fury of Trust/Betrayal. Thankfully, the same animation team worked on this production. Save this for the very end, it concludes the story of Rurouni Kenshin, much more effectively than episode 95 of the TV show. Overall, it was a bit on the boring side, but necessary, as this story needs to be told. Some very dramatic moments though, when Kenshin confronts Enishi.
ADV is known for very poor DVD extras. Their idea of extras are previews of other DVDs they put out. With Seisouhen, they did a decent job: the original Japanese voice actor interviews are fairly interesting, and help to put a face on the work.",1064188800,,767,4.647058823529412

This is the final chapter in the Kenshin series and the saddest. If you think it couldn't get any sadder than Trust & Betrayal then you haven't been following the series. Just looking at the back cover into Kaoru's eyes makes you want to cry. This takes place approx. 15 years after the TV series leaves off. Kenshin and Kaoru are married with a young boy Kenji while the rest of the gang have moved on. However, there is trouble in Asia and Kenshin must leave her once more. Days pass and Kaoru slowly fades away waiting for his return. Will Kenshin return to Kaoru before it is too late?
If you haven't at least watched Trust & Betrayal do NOT watch this. Reflections does look back on the whole series, however it is worth while watching at least the 1st 2 Samurai X movies. Indeed, this IS a powerful tale unlike any other anime series made.",1061856000,,1074,4.429292929292929
1374963,3,B00004YKPY,"If you haven't read any of the Rurouni Kenshin manga nor seen enough episodes of the TV series (even the OVA DVD volumes Trust and Betrayal) then you will be very lost and there wouldn't be a point to watch this DVD straight away. Reading most of the Manga would explain more things to the newcomer. This DVD takes place a few years after the Manga and summarises the key events of Kenshin's life -- from the first time Kamiya Kaoru met the Rurouni known as Himura Kenshin to the day he left her to wander around the world, as well as the most important and well-remembered fights of his life. As you will see, Kenshin and Kaoru are parents of a son known as Kenji, who is now fifteen and learning to use the sword under the tutoring of Kenshin's former teacher Hiko Seijuro. In actual fact everyone has changed. Myojin Yahiko has matured over the years, becoming a strong swordsman, Kaoru has grown ill after contrapting Kenshin's sickness and Sanosuke has gone abroad (that was how he departed in the Manga) and is very much in need of a haircut and shave. As you will see in the movie, Kenshin has become weaker and is close to death but his will power still keeps him going as a Rurouni who saves the innocent. This is why he insists on wandering again but this time Kaoru is certainly ready to wait for him when he returns.
While the TV series did a lot of filler episodes from episode 60 onwards, which did reduce the number of viewers in Japan, this dvd does generously explain some bits of the final arc in the RK Manga since this story wasn't put into animation. This arc is called the Jinchuu arc and if you know who Tomoe is then you will see a family member of hers make his appearance and become Kenshin's most lethal opponent ever.
Anyway despite the mention of the Jinchuu arc, as a whole this film was very sad in many places. Why? Because it implies one huge notion at the end. If you are an emotional person then I suggest you get your tissues ready. The music will make you move and seeing the characters cry or show sadness is only going to make you lose your cool from suppressing emotions. I was able to watch this film through once and that was it. The animation is similar to the first four OVA episodes, which might explain why the film was more than just very sad and serious.",1061424000,,2302,4.34338747099768

But man, this movie has the mood of the first OVA, only 10 times more depressing. Nonetheless, I thought it was really good, and I also loved how the big fight scenes from the series were remade. I thought that they looked alot better. This movie is just about Kaoru's life after she met Kenshin. It shows how it was for her while Kenshin was off somewhere when a person wanted to fight him. What I thought was the saddest part was when Kenshin wanted to go off and try to help people. What made this so sad is he left Kaoru for like 15 years. Then when you see him again, you feel the beginning of the saddest endings I have ever seen in a movie, regardless that this was a cartoon. I am not ashamed that I cried at the end, because I doubt that anyone out there would be able to hold back the tears once you see this great, but sad movie.",1059955200,,971,4.0625

They changed a few parts from the series, they made it more realistic and serious. Although I haven't watched all of the episode in the T.V. series,there was a big spoiler for me when i watched this movie but it's okay. The first half was pretty fast,I thought Woah! thirty minutes already?
  The second half,it still reflects a little bit more. Then I started realizing how much Kaoru really loved Kenshin.
 How devoted she was. She was willing to suffer the same way that Kenshin suffered.*although i watched this movie with immature kids,they thought it was nasty*Then towards the end I felt my eyes get all watery.then 5 minutes after that it get sadder and sadder until I was blubbering I couldn't control my tears.

1374966,3,B00004YKPY,let me start by saying if you are light of heart...DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!! I love Rouroni Kenshin it is one of my favorites.  In this movie...they portray Kaoru and Kenshin ( shinta) to be weak characters.  The story in itself is kaoru reflecting on how she feel in love with kenshin and what they had gone through. I think the series should not end like this...but that it should have been one of a happy ending.  Kenshin finds himself lost in repentence.  I won't tell what exactly happens in the movie....but there will definately not be  any dry eyes.  Please watch the other kenshin videos before buying this one...because it will truly ruin the whole experience.,1059523200,2,669,4.627118644067797
1374967,5,B00004YKPY,"Before you decide to buy or watch this DVD I suggest seeing Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal first, you'll have a better understanding of the second part of this DVD...there are two parts to this movie. Warning: This review contains spoilers.
Being the ending to the whole Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X series, the first part consists of what is basically a clip show, showing important events that happened in the TV show. They have been changed a bit, where there is violence, it is more graphic, but this makes it more realistic. You should probably check out the Rurouni Kenshin TV series if you already havn't, before watching this.
The second part is the actual movie. If you saw Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal you will have an understanding of what happened before, and why Enishi came back to kidnap Kaoru. Enishi want revenge, and he wants to kill Kaoru right in front of Kenshin to get it. When Kenshin comes, Enishi and Kenshin have a fight, and in the end Kenshin is willing to sacrifice himself, if it will truely make Enishi happy. Enishi can't bring himself to do it, and they never see him again. The rest will make you ball your eyes out if you are a hardcore Kenshin fan. Kenshin developes a disease, leperacy I believe, and is slowly dieing, losing all strength and skill. Kaoru cannot live with out him, so she chooses to get the disease too. In the end Kenshin dies with his head in Kaorus's lap, as Kaoru thinks of future cherry blossom parties they'll have...inviting everyone...then she sees that he has died, she takes his head in her hands, and cries.
There are a couple more surprises, you'll learn what happened to Yahiko, Sano, and Megumi.....and Kaoru and Kenshin's only son, Kenji. This is definatly a movie worth buying if you are a Kenshin fan. But be prepared to have your emotions shaken, it has an ending you'll never forget.
Parental Concern: This movie is rated suggested 17+, there is violence and blood, and one scene where Kaoru and Kenshin are laying down nude, kissing, you can't see anything, since the screen ends at about the neckline.",1059091200,4,2077,4.662125340599455

1374980,5,B00004YKPY,"'Reflection' is a fitting title to the last chapter of the life of our favorite wandering swordsman, Kenshin Himura.
Ruroni Kenshin is my FAVORITE anime/manga of all and while this OVA is one of the saddest movie I've seen, anime or live-action, I feel it's an appropriate ending to the series.
Gorgeously animated, it's identical in style and spirit to the first OVAs Trust & Betrayal. While the first OVAs had dark and somber colors, 'Reflection' is full of bright and vivid colors that's mesmerizing to watch.
Unlike the TV show & first OVAs, this story (goes beyond the manga) is told from Kaoru's point of view, from when she first meets Kenshin to their life together 15-18 years later. You get to see Yahiko, Sano, Megumi, even Hiko once again and meet Kenji, Kenshin & Kaoru's son (the manga only shows him as a toddler).
You will see reenactments of familiar battles in the TV show, but the animation here is far superior, the battle in the moonlight with Jinei and the Jinchuu battle with Enishi are just AWESOME!
The instrumental sountrack is haunting and beautiful, composed by Taku Iwasaki who also did Trust & Betrayal.
Buy this if you are true Kenshin fan and have an open heart and mind.",1057881600,25,1203,4.679245283018868

I do feel this should have been a longer OAV, focusing more on original content and the background of the characters.  I don't the flashbacks supply enough about the respevtive character's development.  While I felt the ending was well done and liked it, I'm hoping more it figurative then literal.",1057795200,,506,4.781609195402299
1374982,5,B00004YKPY,"The Samurai X OVA (Original Video Animation) Trust and the second part called Betrayal is truly one of the classics of modern Japanese Animation. The story is about a gentle boy, born in a time of violence. He is trained as a master swordsman, and becomes an assassin during the Japanese civil war of the 1800s (known as the bakumatsu). This story is about the conflict between one's ideals and one's actions. The conflict between Kenshin's desire for a peaceful world, and his occupation as a cold-blooded murderer.
This story is very violent. Assassinations are shown in a very graphic way, but the violence is used to emphasize the dichotomy between the ideological youth's dreams and actions.
The conflict is brought into focus when the main character, Kenshin meets a woman named Tomoe who makes him question the life that he has chosen.
The graphic violence makes this a title for a mature audience, but a mature teen may also appreciate this work. The main character comes from the anime / manga series Rurouni Kenshin that is set ten years after this story. I stongly recommend that you watch this work subtitled in Japanese, as the original voice acting is very fine.
Don't let the violence prevent you from seeing this excellent work.",1057449600,10,1244,4.845070422535211

I like the looks on my friend's faces when they saw the beginning. They were watching with their mouth and eyes wide open. As for the rest of the movie,I didn't really understand it that much because I just watched it in english. When I watched it again in japenese with english subtitles,I understod it a little bit but i was still lost. After I read the historical background then I finally understood the movie. All in All,it's a good movie. Oh and one more thing,if your going to watch Trust you better have Betrayal too because if you don't you'll be disappointed at the end of this movie.",1056326400,3,770,4.244897959183674
1374984,4,B00004YKPY,"The second OVA is haunting and depressing, an unexpected end to the whole series. There are very dark tones, and they take the hint from the end of the manga that Kenji hates his father. But the plot is realistic. Kenshin, no matter what, would still go on to try and protect Japan, even to the extent of leaving his family. Bautiful brotherly moments between Sano and Kenshin, as he persuades him to go back to Japan for Kaoru's sake.
The animation is of the same calibre as the first OVA, and the Background music as good. I recommend this if you want a good cry. But beware - You must watch this at the very end of the whole series.
P.S: Did anyone realise that the girl with Kenji that was seen at the end of the series, is the same girl that appeared in Volue one manga of Rurouni Kenshin? At the end of that volume, there is a little bonus story. Her name and design is unchanged - Chitsuru. Lol, I wonder why they re-used that character.",1056326400,,944,4.25
1374985,2,B00004YKPY,"If you've read the ""Jinchuu"" arc of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, or ""Cherry Blossoms in the Spring"" (the _real_ final story in the Kenshin Kaden book), you'll know that creator Nobuhiro Watsuki's vision of the ending was considerably sunnier than what we are presented with here.  But the style employed in the OAV series is better suited for tragedy than triumph, and so we are given an ending where all of Kenshin's struggles and achievements result in disease, dysfunction, and death.  Yuck.
The problems with ""Seisouhen"" lie squarely with the OAV style, which is emotionally muted, arty, and poorly-suited for action sequences.  While this style worked for the Tsuiokuhen episodes (collected in this country as ""Trust"" and ""Betrayal"") which told the most tragic chapter in Himura Kenshin's life, it is a major shortcoming here.  Indeed, the best sequence is a recreation of the climactic Jinchuu battle between Kenshin and Enishi, where director Kazuhiro Furuhashi all but abandons the OAV look for a style much closer to the original TV series (and the manga).
Then there's the question of the material itself.  The Kenshin/Enishi fight is fine, as are several other moments (Kaoru's visions of the past as a series of rooms, the brief flashback appearance of Saito), but why squander all these resources on a re-animation of the Jinei fight from the first TV series (which in no way improves on the original)?  And why the ridiculous subplot with Kenji's hatred of his father, all of which comes from a throwaway joke at the end of the manga?
Still, it's not as bad as the Kenshin feature film!",1056240000,4,1598,4.9440298507462686

It's worth the purchase, mostly because of the interview of the japanese cast.

There are a few future references and a couple of characters which don't look to be in their best shape. Strongheaded Kenji makes and appearence and the dialogue follows more closely to the japanese version (not the censored american version).I would reccomend this mainly to people who have seen the whole series (I hadn't) because it might be a bit confusing if you hadn't. As usual, if you want Battousai check out Trust & Betrayal. Kenshin is just a wanderer now.

But that doesn't take away from the greatness that is Ruroni Kenshin.  I gave this movie 5 stars because it really does tell of actual events in the series. And it has a better ending than the origional series that is closer to the Magna.  this is truly an awsome movie to ad to your colection of Ruroni Kenshin movies.,1054166400,,449,4.309523809523809

He seems to refuse to listen to everyone else and, without intervention, seems poised to repeat his father's mistakes.  Also, the animation, while much different than anything related to it, is quite good, once you get used to the switch.
Now, the bad.  The voices for the characters seemed particularly poorly chosen, and the dubbing at times went from bad to awful.  Worst of all, though, is that this movie is, by my estimation, 70% flashback and 30% new story.  When I rented this movie, it wasn't to watch cherished scenes from my favorite series made into an embarrassing mockery.",1053216000,,763,4.684210526315789
1375011,5,B00004YKPY,"The 'Samurai X' OVA's stand separate from the body of the Rurouni Kenshin series in that the subject is the events preceding and following the television stories.  While the contain a commonality in characters and are the go further in the direction of presenting more of the motivations that lie behind master assassin Kenshin Himura's decisions and provide us with closure on the story of a life full of regret and the quest for atonement.
All of the OVA's, 'Reflections' included, lack the comic relief of the TV series.  In that sense they are an acknowledgement of Kenshin's contribution, and the ongoing price he would have to pay for being a murderer.  In 'Reflections,' Kenshin seeks the ability to be at peace again.  And Kaoru, the loyal wife of his later years wants desperately to be as important a part of his life as his first love, Tomoe, who sacrificed her life at his hands so that he could go on to fight the Shogun.
The pressures of their lives drive them apart on more time, as Kenshin travels to China to help the living.  But the real story is the retelling of their relationship and it's themes in carefully interwoven flashbacks.  The threads of destiny and duty wind tighter and tighter as the drama, reminiscent of Greek tragedy as well as Noh plays, comes to its bittersweet conclusion.
It is almost unfortunate that 'The Cross-shaped Wound' (the last episode of the previous OVA volume) reached such a high standard of artistry.  'Reflections' is wonderful, beautifully written, illustrated and scored, but it lacks the utter magic of its predecessor.  I can't fault it though, it is the difference between excellent and perfection, and I am delighted to have experienced both in the same series.
Part of the stories charm is the maturing of not just Kenshin and Kaoru, but many of the supporting cast.  Yahiko Myojin, a loyal friend, is a story unto himself, and several villains also make surprising developments.  All of this gives the story a compelling multi-dimensionality that is infinitely satifying.
Because Rurouni Kenshin is a historical romance surrounding real events, as well as a story with deep samurai roots, it appeals to a broad audience.  In a sense, it stands at the apex of the use of anime as classical Japanese drama.  Thus, it is worth seeking out for many reasons, illuminating and uplifting as well as entertaining.  Above all, it will become an unforgettable memory.",1052956800,38,2422,4.878048780487805

It actually makes a nice twist, and is somewhat fun to compare the characters and animation to Rurouni Kenshin! The animation to Samurai X is so much more realistic and is somewhat similar to Ghost in the Shell animation, where as Rurouni Kenshin's animation is more anime like, and more humerous! Overall this OVA isn't bad, and is worth purchasing if your interested!",1052784000,,553,4.711340206185567

To understand the whole thing you don't really need to have any knowledge of the anime series because as i said its before all that, so it doesn't matter.
 The voice of kenshin is totally different from the series but its cool. The other thing its fairly violent so if you don't like that type a thing don't buy it.

I felt that this was a very good movie, albeit very depressing.  The animation was wonderfully done, the music was outstanding and fit well with the story being told.  With the story in mind, if you haven't followed the tv series your going to miss a lot in the way of certain characters and how they came about and their development.  The ending to this movie I felt was appropriate.  Kenshin in all his life has known nothing but the pain and suffering of those around him.  For him to finally find the peace he wanted was gut wrenching to watch as he left Kaoru behind.  Once again this an excellent movie, I won't give any of the details to this as it would spoil the movie.",1051401600,,823,4.298701298701299
1375015,4,B00004YKPY,"A very depressing ending, the ""Reflection"" story nevertheless, touches the heart. The graphics are beautiful and although my only real gripe is that the Enishi arc was changed a bit and also perhaps more could have been done with it. But I think the ending was more than appropriate.
I've been reading many people saying how it's stupid that Kenshin becomes weak and dies of an illness. Last I checked Kenshin is human. He bleeds and he breaks. And, he ages.
Regardless of how skilled or legendary you are in your prime, age will catch up with you. It's real and it's what I loved about the Kenshin series. Many of his conflicts, feelings and emotions though not always his fighting seemed real, almost as though he existed. In some ways, I think he did.
Thus as a person gets older, they succumb to natural causes. Sure, Kenshin suffered broken bones and blood loss, but that doesn't compare to the toll that a neurological disease like leprosy can take over long periods of time. SARS, the new found super pneumonia, can take any healthy person and put him or her on a respirator in 5 days. Resting a broken bone allows you body to recover and mend. Fighting a disease never allows your body to rest. And you can only fight so long.
I would rather see Kenshin pass away from natural causes than be killed in a battle, and ruin his legacy. I don't think Kenshin was ever meant to be the immortal swordsman. As Kenshin's own master said, you're not a God and you're not a demon. Just a man.
In a way, even though the ending hints at Kenshin's death, it can be interpreted in a happy way. Kenshin, after many years, finally resolves his conflicts. Atonement for the deaths he has caused. The death of his wife. His answer to her. Finding a new life and love, and in the end even in his weakend state, he finds peace within himself.
The ending brings a closure and peace to a life full of hardship for an extrodinary character. The legacy of Kenshin and finally Shinta, will live on.",1051315200,,1981,4.475138121546961
1375016,3,B00004YKPY,"A nice anime overall, but most definately NOT Rurouni Kenshin. It was depressing to the point it made the previous OVAs look like care bears, and was mostly a recap of previous things. Truthfully, the main reason I liked it was because it revealed Kenshin and Kaoru got married. Even if Kenshin was dying of a disease? and fought in another war? I think?",1051142400,3,354,4.546875
1375017,4,B00004YKPY,"If you are new to Kenshin (or Samurai X, whatever), do NOT watch this.  This DVD contains what is essentially the END of the whole Kenshin storyline, and it contains a LOT of flashbacks to previous events.  If you are new to Kenshin, you should start by watching the Rurouni Kenshin TV series or the Trust & Betrayal (aka Tsuiokuhen) OVA series.
For those of you familiar with Kenshin, this DVD contains a 2-part Reflection OVA (aka Seisouhen) which takes place 15 years after the TV series.  Almost all of the 1st episode and about the half of the 2nd episode are recaps of everything that has happened in Kenshin previously, told somewhat through Kaoru's viewpoint.  The rest of the 2nd episode gives a nice, sentimental ending to the whole Kenshin saga.  In fact, the whole OVA is filled with nostalgic, sentimental atmosphere (fittingly, I suppose, since it IS mostly flashback), and although the action sequences are well-animated, you would not call this OVA ""action-packed.""
This OVA is obviously intended to give a sense of closure to the Kenshin saga, and it should be taken as such.  Now, some Kenshin fans may not be happy with the kind of closure this OVA gives, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.",1051142400,,1215,4.7075471698113205
1375018,3,B00004YKPY,"One of the most disturbing images in the new Kenshin OVA Reflection, is to see Kenshin failing in the grip of some sort of disease. This illness however, is a reflection of two distinct things: in the story presented here, Kenshin is not afflicted with some earthly disease such as leprosy or turberculosis. Megumi tells Kaoru that Kenshin is only a man, and that all of the fighting he has done will eventually take its toll. Kenshin also talks about having given up his sword and suffering in a different way to continue atoning for his past - and that is what I believe causes his illness. The lesions are an outer reflection of his inner turmoil and guilt, feelings that his once strong body can no longer supress. Kaoru doesn't contract it because it's communicable, but rather because her soul is so bound up in Kenshin's that she shares all of his pain, spiritual as well as physical. She willing shares his burden out of her great love for him.
The story of Reflection takes a beloved character and reflects a flawed understanding of just who Kenshin was and what his story was about. His essential nature has always been that of a deeply scarred man attempting to atone for his past. He has always suffered and felt guilt for the killing he has done, yet he is also the wanderer who has cared for many people. A man who never abandoned his principles such that his very example has helped other unhappy and guilty souls find peace and purpose (i.e. Megumi, Sano, Saitou, Aoshi, even some of Shishio's Juppengatana). To believe that this man would, after all his been through - even after making his peace with Enishi - STILL be wandering around Japan, abandoning Kaoru and their son, is just unbelievable. The whole point of the story as I understand it is that Kenshin finally finds a home with Karoru at the Kamiya dojo since it was a place where he was accepted for both his past and present selves. He has found peace by defeating (or accepting) his past demons in the form of Shishio, and ultimately Enishi. Not only did Kenshin find rest from his wandering, but also a chance at happiness. The corruption of Kenshin's body is simply a reflection of how corrupt the story of Reflection ultimately is.
It's hard as a Kenshin fan to accept that this is the latest, and presumeably last, installment in Kenshin's story. I believe that while there are some minor good things - such as seeing Kenji (his fight with Yahiko was the highpoint of the story) and finally getting to see Enishi's arc (if only briefly) were minor pleasures in what is ultimately a bittersweet ending. I believe that the original name, Year of Frost, was well very chosen. This is the melancholy version of how Kenshin's story might have turned out if things had been different. I personally prefer the story where Kenshin not only finds peace and forgiveness for himself, but happiness too.",1050537600,34,2875,4.650294695481336
1375039,4,B00004YKPY,"The fighting scenes were extremely detailed and realistic. I really enjoyed those especially those with Enishi and Jineh, but.....
The script was a little off,  Kaoru's personality was very different, Kenshin too pathetic, it makes you want to vomit, and the overall movie just.. depressing! Even though the action scenes kept me entertained, it broke my heart to see Kenshin die at the end- that part gets me every time with tears.
Kenshin appeared to be a weakling in this OVA. I mean, seriously, the man needed some prozac. He was always cowering over all depressed and sad. The movie lacked completely in the hilarious department, which made me sigh. It's really dramatic, and low key. Heck, if I had a lover like Kaoru who cared so much about me, I'd forget about Tomoe and move on, but Kenshin probably was still struggling with the serious chemical imbalance in his brain.
If you like the series, and the funny faces, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for you- it's just too depressing. I try to think that KEnshin didn't die the way he did- It was really pathetic- I disease? Gimme a break! This man is the hitokiri battosai who survived all those scars and broken bones, yet he dies from a friggin disease.",1050537600,2,1210,4.68075117370892

I guess if you can't handle a dramatic ending, you should stay away from it. If you want something realistic, this is it. The thing I didn't like is the length. One episode was almost entirely stuff from the tv series. I did like seeing some of Kenshin's opponents in OAV style animation, but that leaves only one episode for new stuff. It all should've been at least 4 episodes. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of Kenshin and realize not everything can end happily, you must get this.",1050105600,,588,4.453703703703703

This dvd does not give you fighting show or duel like before. But more explanation about their future. They finnally got married and have a son. And in this dvd, kenshin died due to his illness. However the story is sad, but show you the true love from kaouru. Maybe from some people, that kind of love devotion is stupid. But for me, well that's the true love.

1375042,5,B00004YKPY,"I'm a very open-minded person.  When it comes to Anime, I pretty much look at everything from an objective point of view, without ties into what I wanted it to be... but with Kenshin it's a little different.
Anime Style: well obviously by the title and the cover art it's in the style same as Trust and Betrayal.
Gore level: well it is Kenshin... the gore level is lower than Trust and Betrayal, as there is far less killing and more focus on the story, not that the killing in Kenshin was ever gratuitous
Suitablity for Children: well some of the concepts probably won't interest children at all, like most anime.  It does have some scenes that are ""adult"" in that it would children probably won't understand what's going on and something that parents won't want to explain.
Alright, with that said and done you have to first recognize that this is a continuation from the other OVA, Trust and Betrayal.  It's 15 years later, Kenshin has gone to China to help with the wars and hasn't come back yet.  He married Kaoru and has a son Kenji (i believe) who has never really seen his father, Kenshin, and therefore doesn't necessarily have the same respect for him as everyone else does.
So this entire movie is basically spent ""reflecting"" upon the past.  Kaoru reflects back on events involving Kenshin, reasons why she loves him and reasons why he would love her.  There is a new scene she reflects upon that we haven't seen yet.  Remeber Tomoe's brother?  Well he's seeking revenge and captures Kaoru in the process.
The heavy nature of this anime makes it very dramatical, in the idea that most of it involves the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru.  Many surprises come up and Kaoru learns more about Kenshin than she previously knew.
Some of the scenes you'll notice are taken from parts of the TV series... but not entirely.  Some are written a little differently... but nothing too drastic.  Battle in the Moonlight's Kurogasa scene is written a little differently, removing Kurogasa's supposed powers.  Hints at several other battles, such as Shishio and Sojiro.  You get to see the TV series characters in the different anime style, such as Yahiko and Sanosuke.  It is really worth the watch, and yes it does end the Kenshin series.  It's the final atonement, as the backside would show.  If you get it for any other reason, get it for its finality in the Kenshin Series.  Yes we all hate it when our favorite series come to an end, but it's gotta happen... and this way it a good one.
Now if you were a Kenshin fan due to the intense action (like a DBZ fan is) or becuase of the comedy then this might not fit your tastes.  It is crafted after Trust and Betrayal, and if you've seen those and liked them, then this is up your alley.  If you didn't like Trust and Betrayal then you might want to be hesitant about this one first.  Maybe give it a rent or see if you can find some trailers on it, check to see if it really for you.  There is hardly a moment to laugh in these two episodes, most moments make you wonder how Kaoru could possibly love Kenshin, and then what the heck is going through that swordsman's head.  It is everything i expected, everything i could have asked for.  That's me, your opinion of it will be different.  This was mine.",1050019200,6,3262,4.517887563884157

On this dvd Kenshin is a more mature man, in a way, yes if you are looking for action from the start to the end well you have the wrong dvd. This OVA has two episodes. the first is base more in the tv series, I can say it is somethig slow, because you are waiting for maga Kenshin action. the last episode is the real deal. You must need to see what happen not only to Kaoru, but well as Kenshi, Kenji, and friends. if you are have a soul mate this is a perfect movie to see on a raining day.",1049760000,,649,3.7794117647058822
1375044,1,B00004YKPY,I am a big fan of the first 3 Samurai X DVD's and was completely disappointed at this one.  I don't even want to watch the series anymore because of this.  The plot was horrible and boring and the ending is just not satisfying to true fans of Kenshin.  He wound up all weak and stupid.  Totally disappointing and I do not recommend buying it as it'll ruin the entire series for you.,1049760000,8,382,4.191780821917808
1375045,5,B00004YKPY,"For almost two years, I've been following the Rurouni Kenshin series, and one of my favorite parts has been the first OVA series, ""Remembrance / Trust & Betrayal.""  As a result, I was immediately interested in seeing the second OVA series once I knew it was being brought overseas.  And even though before I had heard many times that ""Reflection"" was, to put it simply, depressing, I still wanted to see for myself as to whether or not that was the case.  I'm very glad I did so, for even though it's easy to call ""Reflection"" depressing, there is a story there that is too moving for me to not regard it in a positive way.
I know that there are many RK fans who have considered either the end of the Kyoto Arc or the end of the Revenge Arc (which only appears in the manga, and I highly recommend those who are planning to buy this DVD to read more into the Revenge Arc, as ""Reflection"" takes place a number of years after the Revenge Arc, and makes several references to it) to be the true ending of Rurouni Kenshin.  But even though I count myself among the former group, I still have a healthy respect for the Revenge Arc, because I consider it a very likely possibility of what could happen after Kenshin and the others return from Kyoto.  The same goes for ""Reflection"", in that I consider it a possibility.  Even some of the Japanese voice actors who worked on ""Reflection"" (many of whom are the original voice actors from the TV series) think of this as only one of many possible endings, as they say in their interviews (one of the extras on this DVD.)  However, don't let that deter you from watching this DVD for yourself, for it is a truly moving experience.
For those of you who have been waiting for a story detailing the depth and strength of Kenshin and Kaoru's relationship, your wait is over.  The second OVA series primarily focuses on the bond between them- a burdened protector who does all that he can to help others, but secretly yearns for a time when he can rest and live quietly; and a woman who has been through so many trials by herself, but wants nothing more than to create a home with the man she loves.  In addition, the strength they draw from each other also affects the lives of those around them, even those who don't quite understand it yet, as in the case of their son, Kenji.
Visually, ""Reflection""  easily meets the standards set by the first OVA series, from the vivid use of color and motion to the inclusion of live footage blended wonderfully into the animation, it all comes together to create a very lifelike and vibrant ambience.  And as with ""Remembrance / Trust & Betrayal,"" the music composed by Taku Iwasaki is an almost tangible force that continues to convey the emotion of the story.
All in all, if you're the RK fan that either liked or disliked the first OVA series, or believe that Rurouni Kenshin was either finished too soon or not soon enough, there is definitely something for all to appreciate here, and I highly recommend this DVD to all RK fans.",1049241600,12,3009,4.452727272727273
1375046,1,B00004YKPY,"The newest release from the Kenshin Money Tree features the de-evolution of Kenshin and a fine display of dry, mechanical tragedy.  The sappy attempt to draw the sympathy from the audience is pathetic.  The movie crams your mouth open like that tool from the dentist's office and force feeds you mass produced industry sized amounts of emotional drivel.  No thank you, if I want to cry I'll do it for free and pound my head against the wall.
This is not the ending of Kenshin, those of you wishing to see the ending of Kenshin will have to read translations of the masterful manga.  This movie spends 45 minutes reviewing the manga plot, and spends the remaining 15 or so minutes ""extending"" the plotline to reveal terrible things that happen afterwards.
For those of you who love Kenshin, I hope that there is someway to convince you that the beloved series is over, the complete work is a work of art, and it's time to move on and not blindly seek this out as a way to ""get more Kenshin"".

After Kenshin accidentally murder's his wife Tomoe, Kenshin takes a vow not to kill again. Kenshin takes Kaoru for his wife, but never forgets about Tomoe and the bloodshed he has make in the revolution.

1375049,4,B00004YKPY,"While not to recap what all has been said, Seisohen or as ADV retitled it, Reflection, is the latest of the Kenshin animation, but by no means can you count it the last. The nature of the anime industry is to keep everything viable, even if viewers might think otherwise.
That said, I imported this last year and just yesterday finished watching the ADV version. (subtitled)  I couldn't truly recall any major differences in how the two flowed against each other, so while I'm a novice in Japanese, I did feel the translation worked.  The animation itself, of course, was a little bit cleaner, being the offical domestic release and all.
One thing not mentioned or I didn't catch, was that the character design is somewhat different than in the last Kenshin OVA.  With the introduction of characters of the series, it seems that there was a pull back on the design from more realistic to less. The result is mostly larger eyes and color schemes which refer to the manga and to the tv series.  While, nice, I felt the realism of the first OVA made it even more striking.  Kenshin has fully orange/red hair in this one and even purple eyes to boot, while his son Kenji, ironically, reminds us more of the character design of the first OVA.
So in essence, Seisohen is less of a venture away from the tv series in character design, than was the OVA that preceded it.  The storyline does recap events from the tv series, but its well worth it simply for the slightly different re-interpetations and just to revisit those moments with the much higher quality animation. (The recaps are not related at all to series footage, everything has been re-animated in a different manner).  You also get a glimpse of the Jinchu (Revenge) Arc of the manga, which never made it to the tv series.
And yes, this OVA flies left on a tangent from the manga and the tv series, but then again, the tv series did the same with the manga.  The underlying themes of all the above, however, remain true and which is why Seisohen is still a great piece of Kenshin animation.  The music is also along similar themes, but fails to really capture the moment as it did in the prior OVA. By no means is it a lackdown, just not on the exact same level.
I truly hope that with Kenshin now playing on the Cartoon network, even with its english dub, that the series' popularity will climb higher.  Even to the extent that ADV might use its growing clout to attempt to at least offer money for further Kenshin animation. (Long as there's no drop in quality!)
On a pure technical annoying note, the English dubbing of this OVA is done in 5.1 Dolby, while the Japanese is merely 2.0. When will those darn companies think of us folks with home theaters?!
(Gotta love Jin-Roh for that)
Otherwise, buy it, keep it, love it.",1048464000,,2779,4.51792828685259
1375050,4,B00004YKPY,"Yet another quality product from the people who brought you Trust and Betrayal. Fans of the previous OVA will love this DVD. Fans of the TV show will have to put up with even more sappy stuff, but the OVA makes up for it with its awesome quality and good fight scenes. Plus, this is the only chance to see Enishi and Kenji in glorious animation, and we get to see Yahiko and Sano's evolution.
But this does have flaws, first of all we need more Enishi, this guy is to awesome to get such limited scrren time in this series; second, the characters aren't very believable. After watching how some of the flashbacks actually ""happened"" in the TV series, the viewer feels like the characters are just acting in a play, instead of being themselves. The series has much better character development, since the OVA characters are just too dramatic. I was actually laughing on some of the so called ""flashbacks"" because some characters reacted totally different in most situations than how they did in the series. Maybe Kaoru just suffers from bad memory.
This is still a must have title for Kenshin fans, fans of the OVA will love this sappy story, and TV fans get to see their loved characters in a less relaxed environment, but with better graphics and fighting.",1048118400,7,1257,4.616071428571429
1375051,3,B00004YKPY,"I was one of those fortunate people that imported this DVD.  Being a fan of the first rouruni kenshin OVA, and the animated series, I was looking forward too seeing the conclusion.  It was absoloutly beautiful.  Sweet, sad, dramatic, heartfelt storytelling that never ever slipped into cheesiness like some unmentionable films (Titanic.  Gladiator.)  With wonderfully animated and intense action scenes.  It Was a love letter too all the fans of the kenshin series.  A way too say goodbye too kenshin, Kaoru, Sanosuke, Yahiko, Megumi, Tsubami, Hiko Seijuro, and a few others.  The Fates of all of these are revealed in this film.  There are some very sly jokes, like Hiko's continuous love of alcohol and stern refusal not too age.  It drew a tear as the credits roled, for it was just so heartfelt, beautiful, and touching.
Yet I still have nightmares about what ADV did too the last OVA, having seen a imported subtitled version of The first Kenshin OVA; I was appaled at what ADV divided into two disks and called; ""trust"" and ""Betrayal"".  Tomoe was rewritten into a Vamp, enishi into an arrogant young man, and Seito was okinas master, plot inconsistancies were abundant.  Changes too the plot were everywhere, and nothing was changed for the better.  As any fan that understands japanese, or saw the imported subtitle, ""Trust"" and ""betrayal""  will tell you, The ADV version was watered down in complexity and depth.  I shudder too think that ADV will repeat such a tradgedy with this release.  They have already changed the title from Seisouhen (year of frost) too Reflection.  So perhaps my misgivings are correct.
Nonetheless, I am quite happy with my import.  those unwilling or unable to do so, feel free too pick up this domestic release.  Its better then nothing.  And I am hoping that ADV for once only changed the title of the DVD and nothing else.  Unfortunately they do have a bad reputation for watering down perfectly good anime, but I will keep my fingers crossed.",1046822400,4,1982,4.856716417910448
1375052,4,B00004YKPY,"I just finished watching this one, and I have to say it's just SO sad...
Yes, this is closure to the series, but, like it's been said, this is more of a follow-up for the first OAV than the TV show. It's mostly taken from Karou's point of view, so the storyline seems more skewed, since we don't get to see development from Kenshin's side, like in the TV show. Also, it plays with the storyline, not being QUITE accurate, but not completely deviating... at least, not until the end.
Still, you get to see Karou fall in love with Kenshin in a fairly intimate way. Although we get to see that in the TV show, there's something in this OAV that makes you understand why she just stuck with him the whole time.
Hmmm... besides you get to see Tomoe's brother, Enishi, Sanosuke, a grown-up Yahiko (he's COOL!!), Kenshin and Karou's son, Kenji, Megumi, and Hiko-sama. For this alone, I think this was worth it... although... um... tough call. THE END WAS DEPRESSING!!
Let's see... the animation is as good as in the first OAV, the music is equally sad and haunting, and the voice actors did a wonderful job.
Frankly, I think if you really need to finish off the story, watch it, but be prepared for the fact this is NOT the TV show or the manga. There's no joy in it, just like the first OAV, but there's a lot of quiet moments...",1046822400,2,1323,4.3603238866396765
1375053,5,B00004YKPY,"In 1854, Shinta, a young boy sold into slavery is the sole survivor of an attack that kills an entire caravan.  He is only saved because Hika, one of Japan's legendary swordsmen comes upon the slaughter.  Hika is so impressed with Shinta's courage that he renames him as Kenshin, and takes him as a pupil.  Ten years later, Kenshin Himura parts with his master to become an assassin in the service of the Chosho clan - helping the plot to bring down the Tokugawa Shogunate and restore the Emperor.
These are spectacularly violent times, marked by riots and killings on both sides.  There is plenty of work for an assassin, even one who is barely out of his childhood.  Kenshin becomes a deadly killer, soon considered one of the most dangerous in Japan.  In one of his early missions, he receives the first half of the X-shaped scar that marked his face.  And so sets up a chain of destiny that provides much of the charm and depth in an otherwise grim tale of politics and revenge.
The two episodes in this DVD, along with the two in 'Betrayal' are a prequel to the long running TV series that has captured imaginations in both Japan and the US.  Here we learn of Kenshin's beginnings and accompany him through events in 1864 leading up to the end of the Shogunate.  In parallel to the historical drama being played out is Kenshin's relationship with Tomoe Yukishiro, the woman whose betrothed lover was killed by Kenshin.  Tomoe keeps Kenshin from losing all his humanity and saves him from wasting his life in a senseless gesture.
This is a beautifully created series.  Free of the 'limitations' of the TV series, director Kazuhiro Furuhashi chose to create a darker story line with much more delicate film values. Artwork and music enmesh the viewer without ever overwhelming the story with technical excess.  Scenes of beauty interspersed with the sudden violence of the assassin's work.
Because of the prequel nature of these episodes, 'Trust' and 'Betrayal' are a perfect starting point for those interested in the series as a whole.  And, even if you go no further, you will never regret the time spent.",1046563200,16,2111,4.7193460490463215

I am a die-hard fan of the manga, and I was really hoping to see the Enishi saga animated in its full glory, but unfortunately, that segment is only about 20 minutes long, max.  It gets a bit of beautiful treatment, but it's nothing like it could have been.  The majority of the OAV concentrates on a time 16 years later, and although the story is really good and wonderful, it is also horribly sad.  It's not all depression, though...there are several really nice, heartwarming moments.

This is a good series for both men and women.  For the men the fight scenes are explict and brutal, and for the women the entire story is based around a tragic relationship, and it works perfectly.  I love everything about this 2 part series, the only thing that I find error in is putting them on 2 different DVDs.  All 4 episodes could have easily been put on one dual layer DVD, but since this is such a great series I guess they knew you would buy them both so they would be making twice as much money (same thign with Macross Plus), regardless it's still worth the money.",1045440000,4,751,4.335714285714285

1375078,5,B00004YKPY,"Taken together with its second half, ""Betrayal,"" this is far and away the best anime I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a bit.  It is vastly superior to the Rurouni Kenshin series, the motion picture, or just about any other anime series or movie one could name.
This is not in any way similar to the series, except in character and setting.  The entire atmosphere and premise of the OVA is dark, depressing, and tragic.  There is a great deal of death on all sides, and the stereotypical ""good guy vs. bad guy"" herofest is nowhere to be seen.  There is confusion over who the bad guy is, and though there are traitors and assassins everywhere, their motives are not evil, or even (for the most part) selfish.  It reminds us that the only thing which often separates mortal enemies is nothing more than a different point of view - two sides of a coin.
The animation is essentially flawless, aside from the strangely colored blood which at times seems to be a little too vibrant when spilled onto stone walls.  The fight scenes are fast, brilliant, and have the same lethal edge of efficiency as Himura's sword.  The imagery, the depiction of both characters and environment, is extremely well done - mood, thoughts, and atmosphere is immediately evident and presented masterfully - all of which leads one to believe this OVA to be the work of a profound poet.
The soundtrack is haunting, and magnifies immensely the melancholy that permeates the characters and storyline.
For anyone who is a fan of anime, a fan of samurai, or a fan of tragic drama, this OVA, along with ""Betrayal,"" is absolutely must-have.",1044748800,3,1612,4.654929577464789

It starts of with a grieving and lonely Kaoru, hoping for Kenshin's return from China.  As she begins to slip from this world, she begins to recall all of their memories and times together.  One will see familar fights from the TV show, only they have been re-mastered and are more realistic.  The only problem with this movie is one must read the manga first.  The manga consisted of four parts, of which only two were animated.  The third season of the Rurouni Kenshin TV series was made up on the spot for the TV show.  Without reading the third and fourth arcs of Rurouni Kenshin, the movie will seem a little obscure to viewers, though it is not terribly hard to follow.

1375080,5,B00004YKPY,"Its finally here.  The REAL ending to the Rurouni Kenshin series.  The way it was meant to be.  Not some horrible filler episodes, but an OVA based off of the last manga arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series.  The main part takes place years after the last manga, when Kenshin and Kaoru have a son, Kenji.  Kenshin is on his way back from a trip to China.  His ship gets caught in a storm and in his efforts to save a man from being thrown overboard, he himself is thrown overboard.
  Kaoru is sick, and after coming back from the port to look for Kenshin, collapses in the dojo.  What happens next is a large flashback to all the important events that had to do with Kenshin and Kaoru's relationship, the biggest ones being Jin-eh kidnapping her (See the second Rurouni Kenshin DVD, Battle in the Moonlight) and of course, the most exciting of all, Kenshin vs Enishi Yukishirou (This is taken from the Jinchuu arc, the final part of the kenshin manga that was not animated).  You may remember Enishi from the first RK/Samurai X OVA, Betrayal and Trust, he was Tomoe's (Kenshin's first lover) little brother.
  After the flashback comes the final conclusion to the RK saga.  I won't describe any part of it in the review since its probably a better idea to let you see it for yourself..

1375082,5,B00004YKPY,"This DVD presents the first two episodes (30 minutes each) of the Rurouni Kenshin OVA (miniseries), not to be confused with the theatrical film or the main television series.
This DVD (and its companion, Betrayal), presents the backstory of Himura Kenshin (hero of the RuroKen series), during the years of the Imperialist Revolution against the Tokugawa Shoganate (i.e., more than 8 years before the start of the main series).
This particular DVD tells how the orphaned Kenshin meets the solitary master of the ancient Hiten Mitsurugi style of Japanese swordsmanship; how the kind-hearted but tormented Kenshin is drawn into the rebellion (against his master's wishes); and how he comes very close to losing his soul as a special assassin for the struggling rebellion. It also recounts how the mysterious young woman named Tomoe comes into his life, and what happens to them when the Shinsengumi (a sort of police force for the Shogunate who are tasked to hunt down and stop the rebels) closes in on the bickering rebel factions.
The OVA is very different in style and tone from the main series; subjectively, I can't decide whether it's better or worse (the two stylistic presentations are intended for two different target audiences, I think, and both do their distinctive jobs very well). Objectively, the animation is more detailed, nuanced and realistic. Music and sound are at the same high standard (by the same composer, too, I think), but appropriately more tragic and epic and even understated than what is sometimes found in the main series.
These two DVDs stand well together as an independent storyline (it isn't necessary to know, or be a fan of, the main series); and in some not-insignificant ways, the film is better than the comparable live-action American Revolutionary War movie _The Patriot_. There are high standards of realism to the film--no hyper-jumps, or vacuum-slinging swords, but merely extremely realistic swordfighting.
The violence level is very high, particularly in the first half of the first episode; but it is in keeping with the central point to the film: no matter how necessary killing may sometimes be, it is still a tragedy that threatens to turn the killer (even with the best of intentions) into a monster. Like many of the best oriental fighting-movies (and like the main series upon which the OVA story is based), the underlying message is actually rather anti-violent. Language is roughly PG-13 material. There is no nudity or sex, although the conversation veers occasionally into 'adult themes' (for entirely good reasons with respect to the plot).
DVD production values are competent, though nothing particularly special. English dubbing is very good, and subtitling makes good sense; both are distinctive enough to be worth going through each, but overall I prefer the dubbing. Not being familiar with the Japanese language, I can't gauge how accurate they are to the original, but they fit what's shown very well.
It's difficult to recommend when a fan of the main series should watch this. Fans should definitely get it, but it does contain many 'spoilers' about the history of Kenshin. The best time might be after season two of the series.",1038787200,,3195,5.0876190476190475

Unlike the Kenshin serie, The OVA is much more serious stuff... all the fighting are much more detailed, the soundtrack is also awesome, it match the movie perfectly!  The storyline is also very interesting and the movie itself incredibly well made...
It has a great deal of violence which i think is more suited for a mature audience.  The movie is also not too long, 4 episodes, just enough to carry u away  without getting you bored.
It has everything in the movie, Action, Suspens, Violence and an incredibly nice romantic tale.
This is a really must see!

1375097,5,B00004YKPY,"Short Version - This is part 1 of the two part Rurouni Kenshin OAVs, and although it has its share of flaws, it ultimately proved to be extremely worthwhile. A must-see for any serious anime fan or anyone serious about true art.
Long Version - As a die-hard fan of Rurouni Kenshin, I could seriously hurt myself before giving anything involving Kenshin a rating of below three stars (see my review for the movie), but thankfully, this OAV series was just short of perfection. My 5 star rating is actually more like a 4 1/2, but I had to round up. Below, is the explanation for this as I rate several aspects of the OAV.
Plot: ""Trust"" essentailly details the dark beginnings of our favorite rurouni (wandering masterless samauri) and is the long-awaited animated version of the Memorial Arc. Set in the year 1864 at a time of civil revolution, Himura Kenshin leads the afflicted life of a shadow assassin for his political faction, the Ishin Shishi. He is only a young boy himself, but every night when he receives a dark envelope with a single name inside, he must go out to commit murder. Drenched in human blood and unshakable memories, he longs to find inner peace. Will the mysterious young woman he meets one night outside a tavern be that salvation? Or, more importantly, can he afford to trust her with all the danger that stalks him?
Intricate and poignant, the plot of this OAV is the foundation upon which it stands. Not once does it falter in providing this support. 5/5
Pacing: This anime had an almost perfect pacing, like clockwork. The speed felt neither too slow nor too fast, although it did drag in a few places. But it wasn't too long before something happened to capture your full attention again. All in all, the pacing reflected the mood of Kenshin's life very well - a languid, dream-like sort of state where everything steadily flows forward without stopping, but you wish that you could halt for just a moment to take a look around at where you are. 4.5/5
Animation: This OAV gets much praise from both critics and fans alike for its ""life-like"" animation and rich backgrounds. However, I found the animation to be strangely wooden and uninspiring. The people especially looked quite disturbing when I first viewed them. They all had rather blank expressions, and even Kenshin looked like a rag doll. The backgrounds are draped in shades of black and dark greens, and, granted, this is supposed to be a very dark film, but I felt it was gratuitous in its sombreness. At many parts of the film, a lot of what's happening in the foreground simply blends into the background due to lack of contrast and this detracted from the viewing experience overall. Plus, the odd CGI shots thrown in were needless. 3.5/5
Music: ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!! If you watch this OAV series for any reason alone, it has to be for the music. In tune with the gloomy atmosphere, the music (composed by Taku Wasaki) is primarily composed of steady, drawn-out rhythms that bring to mind images of slow-motion sword battles and starless desolation. The battle music for the OAV is heart-pounding; made more so by the fact that the orchestra builds up masterfully and gradually to a climax - unlike a lot of other scores whose fight themes are simplistic banging of drums. There is no j-pop to be found here, nor the decidedly more electronic sound of the TV series' OSTs. Classical orchestra and woodwind sounds comprise the entire score - which is a wonderful thing. This is the type of score you can listen to in times of joy, in sadness, or even just when you want to fall asleep to something that'll inspire your dreams. Trust me, one listen and it'll all make sense. A very enthusiastic 5/5
Accuracy: The OAV is pretty good about accuracy although I did notice some deviations from the manga's original storyline. The OAV left out some parts from the manga that I thought were pretty important for the story. For one, the storyline was stripped of any possible spark of humour or lightness. In the manga, the story was still dark, but traces of cheer could be found at odd moments. Nothing like those here, and it irked me that Kenshin was made out to be completely devoid of the brighter emotions. But other than that, a commendable effort. 4/5
Voice Acting (seiyuu): The original voice actors from the TV series return for this OAV, with the talented Mayo Suzukaze as Himura Kenshin. Not many of the characters from the TV show showed up in the Bakumatsu, however (obviously), so the cast was mostly new actors. Not one of them were poorly chosen, however, as always, and the characters were all brought to life on the screen with believability and impeccable timing. If professional seiyuu can't emote, I don't know who can. 5/5
OVERALL: After averaging all the scores, we come up with 4.5, which would round up to a five. As I've covered, this anime was certainly not perfect - but it came pretty close. I am a huge fan of the TV series, and at first, I disliked the OAVs immensely, simply based on how different they were from the series I adored so much. But after several viewings, you come to appreciate and love the OAVs on their own, and not just because you can compare them to something else or to another anime series. The Rurouni Kenshin OAVs stand on their own as a pinnacle of Japanese animation, and ""Trust"" is without a doubt a strong and engaging prelude to the incredible second half. I recommend both DVDs with my most sincere enthusiasm and love for this series. You will not be disappointed.",1030492800,8,5514,4.656410256410257

1375099,5,B00004YKPY,"First off I would like to say that whatever written in my review is my opinion and mine alone. It is neither fact nor fiction, It is merely how I interperuted the story. Now, with that off my back I shall move into the reviewing part of the review.
In the beginning of this sad tale Shinta`s (The lead character, later known as Kenshin) Caretakers were brutally murdered (No gratuitous rape scenes involved thank god) filling him with, not hate but a certain need to help people.
He is saved and trained by a great warrior who changes Shinta's name to Kenshin Beacause he claims it's more manly or something like that. Kenshin becomes a great fighter but He feels that his master is holding him back. He wants to save the innocents that are getting slaughtered during the war. His master won't allow it because he thinks Kenshin is not ready. Not physically unready, but mentally unready. He fears that Kenshin will become a killer. And that's exactly what happens. Despite his masters warnings he leaves and works for a group fighting against the ""Bad Guys"".
At first he uses his blade only to protect people. But before long he is asked to asassinate someone. He is asked to kill someone who has been killing innocents. He hesitates but does what he is asked. Pretty soon he is killing hundreds without knowing what they have done. He just does what he is told.
The animation in Samurai X is stunning, as well as the dubbing.
Samurai X is very violent but is done in a way that makes it beutifull. It's done with such grace it makes it seem more like dancing. Similiar to crouching tiger hidden dragon.
Buy this with Betrayal and if you samurai X thirst still doesn't go away collect all of the Rurouni Kenshin DVDs.",1029801600,,1718,4.54516129032258
1375100,5,B00004YKPY,"[ The same guy from Rurouni Kenshin, but before his no-killing days. ]
This anime is one of the best i know of.  Of course i'm just saying that, but you get that feeling after watching a lot of Anime... at least i do.  And i guess it's a successful anime if you can say that about it right after watching it.
Genre: Action, Samurai.  Its second title is Romantic Tales of the Meji.  While leads one to believe these are romantic tales... which they are.  But the first disk isn't all that romantic... the second disk may be.
ArtStyle:  I'm a casual Anime viewer and i can say that i have never seen art style similar to this one... though they look like so many art styles i just can't put my finger on a similar one.  Realistic, no funny faces or odd features.  Dark.
Gore: Blood, killing, sword fights.
The first disc, this one, is about a boy named Kenshin, you see him as a young child.  Now this is not about Kenshin from the Ruroni Kenshin TV series... by no means, he kills in these.  So you see him as this great fighter who no one can beat.  But he finds this woman one night who catches the end of a battle he was in, and gets rained on by some of blood from Kenshin's opponent.
The second disk is about what happens after disc one (of course) but it focuses on the Woman a lot too.  The second disc, Betrayal is a must buy, it is a very powerful, if you are a Kenshin fan.
These two Dics tell you how Kenshin got the Cross shaped scar on his face.  It'll make you think about it the next time you see another episode of Ruroni Kenshin.
I recommend this to any Anime Fan, beware the second disc those that are big action fans.  Oddly enough, as different as the art may be, the voices are the same as the TV series.",1024531200,6,1725,4.11044776119403
1375101,3,B00004YKPY,"There's already a lot of comments on the storyline, the drawings, etc., but now I want to make a warning here, so everyone knows what they're getting. Personally, I like my anime (specially when it's in DVD) to be as faithful as it can to the original japanese versions. In this case, I must say there's quite a poor job of keeping up with it. That's why I decided to give it 3 stars, NOTHING ELSE (these OVAs are one of my favorite pieces of animation and I would undoubtedly give it even 6 stars, if it was just for the content itself). So, here:
Pros:
  * Good quality masters for source.
  * Subtitles deliver.
Cons:
  * Horrible use of abovementioned masters: Text screens, needed to understand the story development, show up TEXTLESS (!!). This because the masters did not include the japanese text on them.
  * Disgusting titling screens that use ridiculous fonts in outlandish designs and drawings, highly computerized, in replacement for the ancient Japan kind of lettering. Might sound as a minor issue, but clashes terribly with the overall feeling of the show.
  * Case design is very much in the line of the title screens.
I can't say about the dub, because I haven't listened to it and I won't. Don't like dubs. But there, I hope you all think twice before getting this version; if you don't mind these, be my guest and buy.",1023753600,,1338,4.560669456066946

The premise is this - young Shinta (meaning 'boy with a heart' is saved from bandits by the swordsman Hiko, who gives him the name Kenshin (meaning boy with sword in his heart), teaches him the Hiten Mitsurugi sword technique so he can use it to protect people.  However, Kenshin is impatient, and leaves Hiko to train with the Kihei-tai, a group that is rebelling against the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Soon, his skills are noticed by Lord Katsura, the leader of the Choshu clan.

1375109,5,B00004YKPY,"Samurai X, the title is a little decieving. I first saw this in the Philippines under its real name Rurouni Kenshin. I'm covering all four episodes because it would be easier than writing two separte reviews. As the OAV started I did not have high expectations but was soon blown away as the first notes of music floated from the speakers. First off I'm a sucker for backround music, so as you can guess I immediatly fell in love with it. The animation is astounding, and the scenes are fluid. For awhile I had forgotten I was watching anime. The fight scenes are spectacular, the plot moving, and the music haunting. If you believe that buying two DVDs seems too expensive to be worthwhile I recommend that you rethink your view. I have watched these OAVs more times than I can remember and each time it has managed to keep me completely enthralled by its brillance. I leave you without a plot summary because it is better as a complete suprise. Personally the first DVD is my favorite but the second is not to be looked over. If there is one anime to see this would be it. I will warn that the plot and violence is not meant for small eyes. The scenes do get bloody and it would be a waste to watch such a magnifigant anime wihtout understanding it. I would not recommend this for someone new to the anime scene either, if this is you go watch the TV series first then come back so you can fully appreciate this. This is an OAV series for the serious, for comedy look elsewhere for you will not find it here. A few last pieces of parting advice, there is a fine misting of politics covering the OAVs so it may take two viewings or so for everything to fall into place or I might just be a little slow and require those extra viewings, your call. The dub will not be worth your while unless you absolutely loathe the idea of having to read subtitles. Also chances are that I'm not the only one who will be left sitting there going ""wow, what really happened during that time period though?"" after finishing the OAVs. It might be worth your while to glance over a bit Japanese history afterwards to get the full affect. Of course, I may just be a history buff, once again, your call. I babble, ramble, and digress, just order the DVDs and try them out; you won't regret it.

It wasn't that convincing for me to get this but bought it anyway.  And to tell you the truth, I have watched it at least 5 or 6 times since then because of its high production value.  This DVD stretches the flashback that Kenshin is having in the manga series, and not only it has stretched the flashback with style but perfected with mesmerizing storyline along with music score.  I put 'mesmerizing' here to describe storyline, but in fact there's not much of change from the manga series.  It merely shows how Kenshin has become from being a formidable swordman to an assasin, but the way they have presented the story, it's very like melodrama.  I would say the best feature of this DVD comes from unrivaled cinematography and music that raises the whole story to the level where it can compete with anime like Ghost in the Shell and Mononoke Hime.

Never before I have I seen such a tale of human pain and suffering brought to life through such beautiful battle scenes that the violence is almost poetic. The story focuses on a young man named Kenshin whom has been trained to be a master assassin since the death of his adoptive family when he was only a child. Now he serves a small clan that is attempting to over throw the current tyrinical government. Yet things become more complicated for Kenshin when he allows a young woman whom witnessed him kill a man. Yet it is not long before Kenshin begins to find that perhaps there is more to his life. Yet in his world of shadows and death the only language known is that of flesh and steel. The music, voice acting and script are all top notch and superiour to most major hollywood productions. Samuria X is a two DVD OAV(Origanal Animated Video) and is much darker and more violent then the series to which it is a prequel, Rourin Kenshin. This film contains scenes of graphic violence and some mature themes the recommended age for this DVD is 17+.

Mayo Suzukaze(his Japanese voice actress) is the part for that as I've said many times before.  Plus if you have the subtitles going at the same time you'll notice they don't follow the Japanese script at all.

For those that don't know, this is sort of a background to the Rurouni Kenshin anime tv series, and this was made after the tv series. The main character goes by the nickname Hitokiri Battousai, and hes an awesome assassin(almost ninja-like) who is trying to make the world a better place at the cost of people's lives, but he soon realizes another path in life he should take. Saying anymore would ruin it,but you jus have to watch it cuz i can't praise it enough. There's Trust and Betrayal, 2 dvds, with Trust being the best. However, one dvd cant survive without the other. Theres also a movie that follows the tv series, and I suggest viewing all of it eventhough the tv series is 95 episodes long. The tv series is much more comical and a lil less violent(but violent enough), but its still great. If you're more interested in serious,dark,and Ninja Scroll-like stuff, then Samarai X(both Trust and Betrayal) are highly recommended.

It also had a small hint of that kind of silly fall over humor that is featured in alot of anime series and sometimes movies. So when I saw that trust and betrayal featured none of these anime eyesores, It was a big plus. Some people may find the large hair and eyes and sometimes mouths appealing but I don't. I almost forgot about the big sweat bubbles that look like crystal punching bags, there were none and I was glad. I also liked the fact that there isn't any jpop or rock. I doubt that it would go well with an 18'th century setting. The music is great, and fit very well with the movie. The movie has many philosophies from the characters about life, death and killing. It is very violent, but not needlessly overdone. The character design is very good and went well with the smooth animations. I suggest both betrayal and trust to anyone, not just anime fans.
I was going to rate this dvd only 3 stars since it is short, having only 2 episodes on the dvd, but I thought that would be unfair to the movie,since it was good.

1375137,5,B00004YKPY,"Himura Kenshin, also known by many as the Hitokiri Battosai. Unlike the title suggested, he was NEVER A SAMURAI to begin with. He didn't received such title from any but Sony Corporation. Who's too dumb to even recognize his legendary status as the finest assassin ever graced the anime world. Ok, the review: I won't describe how incredibly poetic the story is, but the music and the animation quality is a degree above Ghost in the Shell. The dramatic music in the background fits the mood of the OVAs ( Orignal Video Animation ) perfectly. The character design is a big step toward realism oppose to the TV series' big eyes and big hairs and big... etc.
  The tone of the show is one of the gritty and dark and very bloody. Speaking of blood, there's about three dozen bucket of them shed in this show, but nothing was overdone; everything from the tearing of human flesh to the sound of metal alloy of the Katana forcing its way down toward the inside of human brain is captured flawlessly.
  The dubbing is TERRIBLE, not only does Kenshin doesn't sound like his Japanese counterpart, most of the meaning of the words were altered to be more appealed to the US audience, I recommend you all to set it to Japanese and with subtitles.  One last secret, when you purchased the DVD, turn it flat with the cover sides up, then slip out the cover paper SLOWLY... turn it upside down and prepare for an AMAZING surprise! IT's the ORIGINAL COVERS of the Kenshin OVAs, instead of that ANNOYING Samurai X, ( what a cheesy title! ) there's the orignal title in Japanese "" Rurouni Kenshin "".
  If you LOVE "" amazing bloody swordfights, political conflicts, sadness, moody atmosphere and tragedy of love "" then by all means, BUY THIS DVD! P.S. the love area of this show was handled with such a grace and care, it's not cheesy by any means.",987206400,27,1831,4.53030303030303
1375138,5,B00004YKPY,"There is no way that I can express in words just how fantastic this anime is.  The animation, music, and direction are all top-notch.  Even if you are not familiar with the Rurouni Kenshin series, you will definitely still want to watch these OVAs.  They tell the story of Himura Kenshin's tragic young days.
PS: If you are a Kenshin fan, I would ask that you please sign my petition to Dark Horse Comics to translate the Rurouni Kenshin manga into English.",986860800,,457,4.548780487804878
1375139,5,B00004YKPY,"This four part OVA is simply brilliant. In my book, it rates up there with the original Bubblegum Crisis 8-part OVA and 13-part Tenchi Muyo OVA. The quality of the storyline and animation is excellent. The characters are three-dimensional and the series has to be watched a couple of times to pick up the little subtleties. I look forward to acquiring some more of the Kenshin series, and hope that the animation quality, character detail and plots are equally as well crafted.",986774400,,477,4.829268292682927
1375140,5,B00004YKPY,"For those who have not read articles in animation magazines about Samurai X (Rurouni Kenshin) during the history/politics of Japan (the Shogunate Revolution), I would highly recommend reading about it first before you watch this video. This a must for those who want to understand the background characters first before watching the OVAs. The animation is emotionally beautiful, combining CGI with traditional Japanese artistry. The music is heartrending and the dubbing/subtitling is excellent. It is a violent OVA series so I don't recommend this to any children - which the violence is understandable since this is a bloody revolution with samurais and assassins. If you have to watch a series/OVA/movie this year, Rurouni Kenshin the TV Series, Samurai X: The Motion Picture, and the Samurai X: OVAs are a must-see and purchase.",986774400,,832,5.3106060606060606
1375141,1,B00004YKPY,"I keep on hearing on how great Samurai X was. So naturally I wanted to see these DVDs badly. After finishing the TV series, I went and sent out for these right away. I eagerly popped them in...and what was the first thing I saw? A woman getting a sword through her face. Despite what people may say about it's ""realism"" and ""plot""...I found these to be the worst anime buys I've ever made. The plot was far too focused on history and politics, and there was no action at all. That's right, NO ACTION. I don't count Kenshin slicing people open as action...it's simple bloodshed. Another problem was that there was pretty much no emotion in the characters. They were far too cold and annoying to see...all that they did was cut people up, go to sleep, cut people up, go to sleep. It got better later, but still I felt ABSOLUTELY ZERO emotion when I FORCED myself through this. There was way too much violence for my tastes, it took way too much from a potential story that could catch my eyes. It's not very nice to see an anime take such AMAZING animation and put its use to showing off gore. I can not see how any one could actually like this..but it seems a LOT do. Something with the ""realism"" it has. Hmmm, last time I checked real life had more realism than an animation...",985996800,3,1277,4.347280334728033
1375142,5,B00004YKPY,"Now this is what Animation should strive to be. Stunning imagery and symbolism everywhere in this OVA series, intertwined with beautiful character development. I was literally drawn into a world where samurais are lurking around the corner and politically corrupt governments and clans reign supreme. In every way this is a stunning masterpiece of historical fiction.
However, I recommend that you should watch at least the first season of the TV series Rurouni Kenshin first. So that this OVA series will be less confusing. I still have to watch it twice before I fully understood the complexity of the poltical environment that this series is base upon. Of course you could always read up about the history of Feudal Japan during that era too. Trust me, it will make a lot more sense.
So if you love Anime and you love a hefty amount of substance in your Anime, then watch this, it will leave you breathless.",985737600,2,910,4.802547770700637
1375143,5,B00004YKPY,"If you're an american watching this for the first time I feel sorry for you.  The series this is a OVA to is already compleated in Japan, and it's great; look for it's boot leg in the states, if the registered version never comes out.  The series, and OVA, is swell, but the dub ruins a lot of it; the japnese vioces have a lot more character.  The series, and OVA again, have significantly more plot not to mention tastefull violence than any anime I've viewed in a long time.  Definiatly chack it out, especially if you're into samurai dramas.",985478400,,545,4.42
1375164,3,B00004YKPY,"It's obvious from the glowing reviews that Samurai X is, indeed, good. And yes, for those of use who don't have the attention span of a DragonBall Z fan, this is a great OVA to watch. With its attention to historical fact, emphasis on fluid animation, and a tragic love-story along with it, any anime-fan worth their salt should find something to like in this series. The visual presntation is suprisingly, bright and clear, but the main charachter, Himura, who is clothed in a dark kimono, is not. In this context, we are able to see the vivid contrast between him, and the world that he is surrounded by. Such is the origins of Himura Kenshin, and to say that this a departure from the Rurouni Kenshin tv series is a gross understatment ( though their IS an underlying grimness in the tv series itself, when one looks in-between the humor and light-heartedness ). There are no bouts of slapstick punctuating this show; this is just a straight out story of violence and blood. And at times, it's emphasize on the slaughter is the show's strength and weakness. It's constant barrage of bloody images, though powerful, lacks a certain subtlety, and we seem to find ourselves lingering too long at the maimed corpses. In the film Mononoke Hime ( or Princess Mononoke for the un-initiated ), the combat was often very violent, but not neccasarily gory. The amount of blood in Samurai X makes one wonder if the gore was done for gore's sake, and it almost detracts from this finely woven story. Yet, this is just the first half of 2 part DVD series, and the ending is better than the beginning. A worthwhile purchase indeed.",984614400,3,1620,4.648083623693379
1375165,5,B00004YKPY,"First off, I wish this DVD had included the second disc(betrayal), since they could've easily fit both within one DVD.  Also, the DVD didn't have much in the way of ""extras"" that should've been included.  Ok, enough about the rants.
I won't go into telling a summary of the story.  For those who don't know, Samurai X is actually Rurouni Kenshin in it's OVA/OAV format.  This is not the TV show.  Samurai X can be compared to Ninja Scrolls, Ghost in the Shell, etc.  Why?  For one, it doesn't offer cute little half naked goddesses that appear from the sky to live with some idiot 16 year old teenage kid.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Tenchi and some of it's variants immensely.  Secondly, there's a strong plot that is weaved very intelligently.  The movie is serious and very direct.  As many of the reviewers have already stated, this first DVD is packed with a lot of action and gore.  Don't let that fool you, the gore just adds more to the flavor of a serious storyline.
The art is one of the best I've ever seen in animation.  The movement is very fluid, down to the facial expression.  The environment is beautifully drawn, espcially the snow that starts to fall.  One gripe I do have is that a bit of CGI was thrown in during some parts, however, it doesn't deter from the actual storyline.  The music is perfect during every single moment of the film.  Yes, it's all classical/symphony type.  Like one reviewer said, no J-POP!  Very emotional and very powerful indeed, this rarity among anime only seems to pop up once every few years.",984355200,15,1545,4.512635379061372
1375166,5,B00004YKPY,"I cannot possibly begin to describe this series.  I saw the previews, had a few extra bucks, and decided to buy Trust.  I don't think I did anything but drool the rest of the night.  This OAV is a perfect example of the spirit of Japanese poetry; every action, every second is meaningful, and very professionally done.
As a side note, the graphics and sound are among the best of any anime I've ever seen.",983664000,,405,4.373333333333333
1375167,5,B00004YKPY,"Story The story was about Kenshin's life before he became a Rurouni. It is about when his is still an assasin. When Kenshin's caretakers are brutally murdered, Kenshin is taken in to be taught by the great master of the Hiten misturugiryu, Hiko. Kenshin becomes the assasin, Battosai. Kenshin meets a woman named Tomoe, and the mysterious and beautiful ""romantic tale from the Meiji era"" begins.
Visuals This OVA is really really gory. The gore isn't like Guyver (blood flying everywhere like a fountain) or other shows you might be used to, but its ALOT more realistic and beleiving. The sword of Kenshin tears its way through its victims, with a splattering tearing sound, as blood spurts realisticly through the open wound. I'm not saying that the gore is a bad thing, I think without it the film would be bland and fairly boring. Even if you don't like blood, don't worry, its still worth seeing. Just cover your eyes. The animation is wonderful, and the characters have greater detail in them compared to the TV series. Nice touches like actual water splashing against animated rocks really light up the film. It may seem a bit cheesy looking, but its still a nice addition. Realistic snow fall and flames make it even better.
Sound If you have a DVD player with surround sound, crank up the volume, turn on that subwoofer and you will here the blades slashing, the wonderful classical music playing and great dialouge.  This movie has good sound.
Music This is really a part of sound but... The music is really great! Its powerful and strong and it goes well with the film. You don't here one vocal J-Pop type song during the whole movie. Tells ya how serious the movie is doesn't it? The music plays at the best times and adds a huge effect on the movie.
Buy it? Yes! ...Its good, real good. Although, if you haven't ever seen the TV show, you might want to do some researching before you see this film. Dont expect to completely understand it the first time you watch it. See it again! If you are looking for a good anime film and you don't know what to buy, think of Rurouni Kenshin OVA. YOU MUST SEE THIS OVA",982627200,8,2118,4.559055118110236
1375168,4,B00004YKPY,"I had read the reviews on Amazon of the two parts of Samurai X and was so inspired to buy both on DVD without having seen any of it. I was not disappointed.
As of yet I have only watched the dubbed version, but the dvd contains the original language track too. This a great piece of Anime, not the greatest, but it does have some of the best plotline i've ever seen in Anime.
The whole development of character and plotline is seamless, everything flows smoother than cold mountain dew down your throat. I am a great admirer of romance, especially in Anime, this is a rare example of how action, serious drama and romance can mix into a great piece of art.
In order to get the full extent of the Samurai X, you need to see both parts Trust and Betrayal, you cannot see one without the other. Dont expect lots of action, but the action you do get is top class and is present throughout the 2 parts.",982108800,,897,4.22093023255814
1375169,5,B00004YKPY,"Reminiscent of the lavish samurai epics of the late 50's/early 60's, almost every frame of this anime could stand alone as a work of art. Fans of Japanese cinema will find plenty of visual references to works like ""Kwaidan"" and ""Sword Of Doom"". The violence is sporadic but graphic. Unless you've some familiarity with Japanese history, the plot takes more than one viewing. It's a dark tale of fate and retribution and star-crossed lovers, taking place in one of Japan's most turbulent periods, and one of the finest films -- animated or otherwise -- that I've seen come out of Japan.",982022400,,585,4.801980198019802

I haven't heard the dubbed American voices, but it could only detract from the beauty that this anime is.  The artwork, plot, characters is all simply a poetic beauty, though mature in it's entirity.  Lotsa gore, especially in the first scenes.  The plot was a little confusing for me, but mainly the minor details.. but you can still get the picture easily.  A must buy.

1375172,5,B00004YKPY,"When I first saw Samurai X I was blown away.  The art work is some of the best that you'll see in a Japanese anime flick. The darker imagery brings out the feeling of danger, and the feeling that there is something hidden. But what holds your attention and dying for the next episode is not the artwork, but is the intense story that just leaves your jaw dropped.  No words can describe the beauty that this miniseries pulls off.  In my opinion this is the best of the best.  I have seen a good amount of anime but this is just incredible there is nothing out there that is on the same level as this.  If you see this before you watch the T.V. series you might be a little disappointed in the T.V. series.  You just have to realize that the two are just different in degrees of how serious they are.

He never got a chance to experience  happiness and feels as though it is his responsibility to carry the weight of the world.
