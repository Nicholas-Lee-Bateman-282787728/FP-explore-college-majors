5015376,5,B006SML41I,I am so grateful for these amazing DVDs! This is my second pregnancy and I have not had nearly enough time to stay as fit as I did with my first. Thankfully these DVDs help me target the spots I need some help with. They give you a real workout as opposed to just some prenatal workouts which are more like just stretching. I also LOVE how I can squeeze in a workout segment even if I just have a few minutes. Highly recommend.,1335484800,,427,4.095238095238095
5015377,5,B006SML41I,"I think both of these DVD's are great!  I am very active when not pregnant and it has been a struggle with all of my pregnancies - I'm on my 3rd - to find Pre-Natal fitness DVD's that are challenging enough.  These are a good challenge but not so tough that anyone can't do them.  Erica explains each exercise very well and does a good job of balancing cardio, strength, and stretching.  I would recommend these to anyone!",1334620800,6,422,4.371794871794871
5015378,5,B006SML41I,"I had my baby a year ago, and haven't had the time or motivation to routinely exercise again - until now.  These DVDs are technically ""prenatal"" but I've found them to be great for postnatal fitness too.  I would highly recommend them to any woman looking to stay fit and/or ease aches and pains during pregnancy, and to any woman wanting to get back into shape post-baby.  Erica's instruction is approachable and informative, and thus very motivating!",1334534400,3,452,4.8441558441558445
5015379,5,B006SML41I,"This is such a well done video & workout regime...not only is this good for pregnant women, but Erica will get you in shape before and after your BIG event! Her stylized workouts are a must for mommies to be and this will get you moving, keep you toned and you will feel like a new person!

I cannot say enough to recommend this video. Really. It is SO effective, challenging and yet completely motivating. It is totally brilliant-  It really makes you want to finish, and finish strong!!

Thanks Erica, and keep those awesome workouts coming...I can't wait for your TV show to launch!!",1328486400,2,586,4.561904761904762
5015380,5,B006SML41I,"I received this as a gift from a friend as I am a first time mom in my first trimester.  I like the video series because it is broken into smaller segments, so you can do as little or as much as you'd like.  I have been really tired, so my first intention was to start out only doing an 8 minute segment, but after the 8 minutes, I felt more energy and did another section, too.  I felt great afterwards and had way more energy!",1327449600,,428,3.953488372093023
5015381,5,B006SML41I,"These DVD's were given to me by a dear friend - I am not pregnant yet, but I am still doing these workouts to prepare my body for what I hope to happen soon.  Erica explains the exercises in detail and modifies it to your level.  I have not experienced pregnancy or labor yet, but I feel confident what Erica has done in these workout DVD's will definitely help me before, during and after my pregnancy.",1327363200,,403,4.2894736842105265
5015382,5,B006SML41I,I love these workouts! They leave me feeling great with more energy to deal with my pregnant body. You can really vary the workouts depending on how much time you have and because she incorporates warming up and stretching in the workout you don't have to take extra time for that. I am pregnant with my first and I am so impressed that she is having her third! Now my goal is to look like that after one!,1327363200,2,405,4.205128205128205
5015383,5,B006SML41I,"I've had the luxury of working out with Erica in person during my first two pregnancies. During my third pregnancy, I was unable to train with her in person, and these DVD's were the next best thing! I've trained with other pilates instructors and Erica is hands down the best! Her understanding of prenatal fitness is what makes her workouts so unique. She helps you tone your body safely during pregnancy, but also helps you strengthen all the right muscles you will need for delivery and recovery. She offers a variety of levels and modifications so you can adjust to your own level. The workouts are also great because they are separated into short segments so you can do several in a row for a long workout, or just one for a shorter workout. The DVD's are also great for postnatal workouts too. I can't say enough good things about the workouts Erica puts together. I wish I could train with her in person regularly, but since I can't, these are my go to workouts. I recommend them to anyone looking to stay toned during pregnancy.",1387411200,,1037,4.580645161290323
5015384,4,B006SML41I,Was really handy however I didn't really get time to watch it more than a couple of times due to my pregnancy complications.,1383782400,,124,4.434782608695652
5015385,4,B006SML41I,"You need an exercise ball and light weights for this workout but I've found it to be perfect for my workouts for the 2nd half of my pregnancy. It's not too strenuous but enough that I feel I'm toning, maintaining my fitness level, and getting ready for birth.",1379289600,,259,4.416666666666667
5015386,4,B006SML41I,"I liked this as it is broken into short workouts that I can mix and match. Its challenging but not too hard, only shame is there isn't a specific cool down or stretch workout.",1376524800,,175,4.176470588235294
5015387,5,B006SML41I,"My only regret is I didn't find this until my 7th month! Great series of workouts that can easily be combined for a longer workout. Prior to my pregnancy, I ran marathons, took spin classes, and generally worked out at least 5-7 times a week. I continued to do so during the early months of pregnancy, but eventually struggled to find time to swim, walk or jog after long days at work. These videos were great - I worked in several workouts in the morning or evening. They are challenging, but perfect for a very pregnant body. :) I used right up to delivery and will continue to use in the future.",1369267200,,598,4.348214285714286
5015388,5,B006SML41I,"This DVD was just what I was looking for-- a workout that I could do no problem, but that I could still feel in my muscles the next day. The exercises are the perfect combo of challenging and interesting so the likelihood of getting bored (my fear with a DVD) is extremely low.
The workouts are broken up into sections; sometimes I do just cardio and arms, depending on time, and I think as my pregnancy progresses I can choose just the workouts that my body feels up to doing. I started these DVD's at about 28 weeks and wish I had found them much earlier!",1367625600,,557,4.264150943396227
5015389,5,B006SML41I,This is a great video to keep you active during pregnancy.  You can go at your own pace and it even includes modified examples as well.,1367020800,,135,4.1923076923076925
5015390,4,B006SML41I,"I love this DVD set and will even plan to use it post-partum.  I found it challenging enough for me especially since this pregnancy has been more difficult (as far as pain).  The only thing is after I did the leg workout, I was in pain for several days because of the pelvic pain (might be SPD) I have had my whole pregnancy, so I figured out early on that I could not do that part.  Other than that part, I really do love this dvd set - great workout for pregnant ladies and pilates enthusiasts!",1365552000,,496,4.145833333333333
5015391,5,B006SML41I,"I attended a few prenatal yoga classes when I was pregnant with my son but they were expensive and I didn't always feel ""great"" at class time, which is why I decided to try Knocked-Up Fitness.  I'm 25 weeks and I only tried one workout tonight but I felt good, like I was actually working without doing too much.  I highly recommend this DVD set.  It is much better that the postnatal DVD I bought after I had my son.  I really feel like this DVD will help me get back into shape after baby #2.",1365465600,,494,4.114583333333333
5015392,2,B006SML41I,"I had such high hopes for this product. However, I found the production to be of poor quality and very distracting. The sound recording was not very good (you can hear traffic passing outside the window) and the lack of camera angles made it difficult to grasp some of the exercises and techniques. I appreciate the home-grown concept but it did not translate well. I would not recommend this product.",1364860800,7,401,4.742857142857143
5015393,4,B006SML41I,"I'm one of those workout types that associates discomfort / sweating with a great workout so knowing that I needed to take it a bit easier while pregnant I looked into alternate methods to tone and sculpt. Since I have always had a muscular build I I certainly didn't want to bulk up during pregnancy,  but rather, just maintain what I've already got.

While I'm used to Jillian Michaels DVDs, I found this one to be a nice alternative. I could stretch and tone up knowing that everything was safe - hard to know all the proper modifications - and still feel a little bit of a burn but not in a way that wiped me out. over-flexed my muscles/tendons. You can repeat any circuit 2-3 times to increase your uptake, too as you get used to the workout and your tolerance builds.

Overall, I think it's really great. It's not all that I do. I still run 3-4 miles a couple times a week and then I do this 1-2 times a week. I did a lot of research on videos because I didn't want fluff. I'm a big advocate of working out for both physical reasons and my sanity, so I wanted something that allowed me to log a good work out throughout my pregnancy. I'm 25 weeks and still going strong!",1363392000,4,1176,4.241071428571429
5015394,3,B006SML41I,"I am surprised that none of the reviews mention that many exercises are done on your back.  It is still not considered safe to lay on your back during the 2nd and third trimester and some workouts encourage this with pelvic lifts and tilts and glute, hamstring and abdominal work.  So, although I do like the videos, I am unwilling to put my baby at risk to be fit during pregnancy.",1363219200,2,382,4.366197183098592
5015395,5,B006SML41I,"Erica Ziel's enthusiasm and knowledge is infectious in this wonderful video series.  Her exercises are appropriate for expectant mothers, the modifications are helpful, and the pace is perfect.  She does a great job of making you feel confident while you're working out, especially if a routine is harder than others.  I have bursitis in my hip, and these videos have been the answer to my prayers.  Hip and back pain are easily managed with these routines and the length of each routine is great.  Expectant moms get to choose the the mix they want each day, which adds to the enjoyment and benefit of the program.  Erica is the best!  I'm glad to have found her videos; they've completely exceeded my expectations.  These videos are perfect for busy moms-to-be who want to feel great physically and emotionally, feel beautiful, and enjoy their pregnancy.  This series has been so wonderful I look forward to taking advantage of her new video series for after baby!",1362614400,,966,4.877300613496932
5015396,5,B006SML41I,"erica's personality and techniques are not irritating, she doesn't say any phrases that irritate like some exercise trainers do. she is far enough along in pregnancy that shows you how to do it safely. the sound is a little soft sometimes, but you can still hear fine. you can tell it works your muscles in a subtle gentle way. the next day you will feel it. but you're not struggling while you're working out and i regularly do work out. a good product. the band is a little weak for me, sometimes i use weights instead. or a heavier strength band.",1362441600,,549,4.445544554455446
5015397,5,B006SML41I,"I'm a first time mom, who was previously active but was unsure of how to workout when pregnant, my biggest concern was making sure I was doing safe exercises that would help keep me in shape but not be too intense while still preparing my muscles for delivery. I put a lot of consideration into which exercise DVD to get since there are many options out there and I'm very happy with my decision. Erica gives you easy to follow workouts that you can adjust to fit your needs (either easier or more challenging). She has a positive attitude and makes the workouts enjoyable! I like that she is actually pregnant in the video so it is easy to see exactly how to do the exercises with having a belly. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is pregnant and looking to keep in shape during the duration of their pregnancy!",1361145600,2,822,4.4144736842105265
5015398,5,B006SML41I,"Being a first-time mom, I was unsure about how to workout without hurting myself or my baby. I purchased several prenatal workout dvd's and thus far, Erica's is my FAVORITE! Even if I am exhausted, I feel that her workouts are energizing, easy to follow, and at only 10-15 minutes per workout they are completely easy for me to fit in between naps ;) Prior to finding out I was pregnant, I was working out 4-5x's per week for around an hour or so. I feel that Erica makes sure that the workouts are safe for my pregnancy as well as challenging enough to ensure I don't get bored. She doesn't treat pregnant women like delicate little creatures incapable of enjoying physical activity and I love her for that! I enjoy her dvd so much, I would actually do these exercises after baby's arrival! I hear she has a post-baby workout dvd coming out and I can't wait to add that to my collection. Ladies, you will not regret this purchase!",1360540800,2,931,4.450292397660819
5015399,5,B006SML41I,I've been looking for a complete yoga/pilates workout to do and these DVDs have great segment workouts.  I usually combine 3-4 segments (most of them are about 10 mins each) 2-3 times a week and have been able to continue with the workouts through my third trimester.,1360108800,,267,4.680851063829787
5015400,5,B006SML41I,"I am not one that works out on a regular basis, so I was looking for something that would challenge me, but also be easy on me because I am pregnant and didn't exercise regularly before I was pregnant. I got these as a Christmas gift, and LOVE them! Erica is amazing! She talks to you through the work out, and the work outs are just what I was looking for! I feel so good after I do them. If you are looking for a workout for you and you little baby, I recommend these videos!",1359676800,2,477,3.9791666666666665
5015401,3,B006SML41I,"I was desperate for an adequate workout this pregnancy (I used to run and lift with occasionally vinyasa yoga), so I bought a few workout DVDs.  This is not my favorite.  Here are my pros/cons

Pro:
1.  The core workout gave me a fair leg/core workout.

Cons
1. To get a complete workout, you have to repeat a segment 1-2 times, which is dull watching the exact same video that many times
2. The audio is not very good, when she looks at the ground or turns her head, the audio changes.
3. Most of the workouts require an exercise ball, which was not clear when I bought them.  I had to find mine, dust it off, find an air pump....(you get the picture)
4. I've never done pilates, and I felt that I might have been injuring myself during that entire DVD, because she doesn't comment very much on form, so I was not sure what to do.  Also, I had to do all 5 workouts at once to feel like I did anything useful for my body.",1358985600,11,921,4.111731843575419
5015402,5,B006SML41I,"I enjoy these DVDs. Each segment is about 10 mins or so, and so it is easy to mix and match, or just do a quick work out. Prior to each segment, there is a screen that shows what equipment (if any) is needed for that workout, so it is easy to be prepared. I find these workouts quite challenging. Thankfully, for the harder exercises there are modifications. Also, Erica is very encouraging and positive. She shares tips throughout about what to do with different muscle groups in order to get the best workout or protect our bodies. She seems very genuine and I like working out with her!",1358553600,,589,4.412844036697248
5015403,4,B006SML41I,"I have been trading off between these two dvds and I like them a lot. I like that I get some good ab work because I really need that. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that my thera band broke after only a few days of use, and I am 6 feet tall so I need it long rather than short! It is still long enough that I can use it by holding the very ends but if it breaks again I will have to find something else to replace it. The only other thing is that I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction and one of the leg workouts works my lower back where my problem is, a little bit harder than I would prefer. But it is much better than not working out at all(!!) and these dvds are fast becoming some of my favorites. My joint pain is always much better when I exercise regularly. Sometimes my 2-year-old tries to do the moves with me (lol). Thanks Erica!

UPDATE 2/2013: I am now 33 weeks into my 5th pregnancy. My favorite videos are 10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia, Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1 with Karyne Steben, and these two videos, Knocked-Up Fitness with Erica Ziel. Over the Christmas holidays, we went out of town for a while, and I didn't exercise at all during that time, and I ate a lot more than I needed to, so at this point I am still heavier than I want to be. But I have been exercising consistently for close to a month since that break, and I am still loving these videos. I have been focusing on one video per week, which is nice to stick to something for a week but over the month I get some variety. I have been working out six days a week, and I have stopped drinking everything except water and sometimes milk, and I have been eating a lot less desserts lately. For the past few weeks my weight has pretty much stayed the same, and my back pain is very minimal. Also, I have been getting lots of compliments from my husband lately. He has noticed that my butt looks different than it has for a long time, and he says he doesn't think I have ever looked this good while being pregnant. I definitely feel better now and have more energy than I did during all of my other four pregnancies. The differences I can see are that my butt and the back of my thighs are still separate (rather than meshing together like they always did in the past), and I still have a little pouch of fat on each of my hips but it is shallower even than it was before I got pregnant, and in past pregnancies I always had a couple rolls above my belly, below my chest, and I do have one small one now but it's so much better than before. And my arms had started to get kinda floppy but now they are looking toned lately. And this is my first pregnancy without swelling in my feet and ankles. So I am still excited about my videos and hope to keep using them up until the baby comes, and then after she is born and I'm ready to exercise again, I will likely come back to these videos before going back to regular non-pregnancy videos.",1355788800,7,2958,4.126516464471404
5015404,5,B006SML41I,"I'm into my second trimester and love Erica's dvds.  She is easy to follow and the workouts are challenging, but not difficult. It's encouraging to see a pregnant mama going through all the exercises with you! I was definitely feeling the burn and was a bit sore the next day, but it gets easier if you do it consistently.  I love that the dvds come with a workout guide as a suggestion for which segments to do each day (so you can work out different muscle groups each day). I also found the resistance band helpful - I'm glad it came as part of the set. I feel confident that I can stay fit until the baby comes without overdoing it. Thanks for a great product, Erica!",1355702400,,671,4.275590551181103
5015405,5,B006SML41I,I love how quick yet effective these workouts are.  You can run through them all or pick a few to do if short on time.  An exercise ball is required for some of the segments.,1355356800,,174,3.942857142857143
5015406,5,B006SML41I,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Pilates fun and appropriate for pregnancy. And, the instructor is super sweet on the video. Doesn't get annoying like other exercise videos. also, it is build able exercise as the short segment can be done individually (8-10 mins) or stacked together for a more intense exercise. Baby feels great!",1350864000,,337,4.9298245614035086
5015407,5,B006SML41I,I have only good things to say about these Knocked-Up Fitness DVDs! They are perfect for customising your workouts as they are made up of several 10-20 minute workouts that can be done alone or combined to your liking. I have a very bad back and have had difficulty with yoga and pilates in the past but I find these workouts accessible yet still challenging and I am already seeing my own progress after just a few weeks. Erica is bubbly and encouraging and I find her regular reminders to have a drink of water very helpful! I also love her use of the term 'hug your baby' when engaging your abdominal core. I am a very satisfied customer!,1350691200,,641,4.394957983193278
5015408,5,B006SML41I,"I could not more highly recommend this series of videos for expectant moms. I bought these when I was 18 weeks into my first pregnancy and have used them consistently throughout (1 week from my due date today!). These videos are great for any fitness level as the workouts are short and allow the individual to create their own workout depending on which combo of workouts you choose. The more advanced athlete can repeat workouts for great burn and great results.
Using these videos 5-6 days a week, along with a 30 min walk each day has allowed me to maintain definition in my arms and legs throughout pregnancy. I have had NO back pain, NO sciatica and NO hip pain during my pregnancy. Physically I have felt great and contribute a lot of it to my daily workouts with this series- maintaining strength and flexibility with these workouts has kept me a happy healthy pregnant lady! The workouts also have a lot of pelvic tilt work, squats and hip strengthening which are all recommended by my midwives, chiropractor and birthing class teacher to prepare the body for labor and birth.
I'm very excited to see my body still so strong and lean with my due date just a week away and am confident that these videos have helped me maintain my fitness level over the past nine months. Buy them- you won't be sorry.",1346889600,7,1309,4.574468085106383

Being a pregnant mom of 2, it's not always easy to get to the gym, but with these DVD's I am able to get a great workout in- whether I have 10 minutes or an hour.  It's especially nice to find a prenatal workout that leaves me feeling like I really accomplished something and challenged myself, rather than just stretching like some other DVD's I've tried.  She demonstrates all of the exercises and talks you through them, so even if you aren't a pilates expert, you will know just what to do and get the most from your workout.

A friend of mine posted about these videos on facebook, so I thought I would give them a try. I had never done a pilates video before, and they have exceeded my expectations. Some days its just not possible to get to class, and these videos have proven to be just as good. Plus, I love knowing that when the baby comes, and my schedule might leave me more restricted to my home, I can do these to get back in to shape.

Being able to have such a great workout in the privacy of your own home, especially when you are pregnant, is wonderful.

THEN I found these :) I was an avid runner, indoor cycling, pilates reformer, yoga.. you name it. I began to do these at home with daily walks and felt like I returned to myself, I was exercising again and I felt good about my changing body. These exercises are gentle yet challenging, and they help you become more aware of your body and core muscles. This is so important during pregnancy and labor. I felt the exercises are safe ( as from my knowledge as Nurse practitioner) and there is always a modification. I have tried other prenatal DVDs and I felt like they promoted bad body posture, too many repetitions, too much weight... I never felt this way during these DVDs. And a plus to these exercises and muscle recognition/strength is that my labors were short and my body bounced right back, because all my muscles were still there.  I HIGHLY recommend "" knocked up fitness"" for the mommy to be who want to still feel physically fit as she always did and still have her body in the end.",1455235200,,1115,4.51980198019802

8503769,4,B006SML41I,"I've been doing these pilates-infused workouts for a little over a week now and I really like them! One DVDs has more segmented workouts while other one focuses more on cardio Pilates and core Pilates. I am almost 27 weeks pregnant and have always been active. Prior to becoming pregnant, I used to go to the gym 5 to 6x a week and I would run at least 3 to 5 miles a couple of times a week.

Since becoming pregnant, I'm still going to the gym but maybe only 4x a week and I've dialed back quite a bit on my intensity. I don't really go for a run now because it feels weird to me running; I wanted to do something else to mix things up a bit, so I'm not always at the gym. I now go to the gym about 2x a week and on other days I would work out from home with Erica's DVDs. I didn't think these would be hard and they don't feel too difficult, yet I'm usually sore the next day. I think these exercises are definitely gentle enough for pregnant moms but they will work you if you do at least 2 segments each time!

I'm happy I had discovered these DVDs and plan to work out until the end. I'm a FTM so I'm hoping by keeping up with my fitness routine, I won't gain an excessive amount of weight :)",1422921600,,1197,3.9421487603305785

I kinda wish it had been recorded in like a studio though, you can see cars and people driving by through her window in the background, otherwise, a nice workout.",1414022400,,304,4.410714285714286

8503774,4,B006SML41I,"I was taken a back by the recording quality. I figured for this price, it would be as nice as name brands. The sound quality isn't the best, the script is lacking, and it's just her.
 The sound has an echo quality to it, but it's just her in a studio. It makes me feel like this was made on a at-home camcorder w a tripod.
 On some moves, she mentions how to modify it, but not all moves and she doesn't demonstrate it. There's no one else to demonstrate modified moves or advanced.
 Maybe I've been spoiled by other videos where the instructor points out what should be happening and where the move should be moving.",1397347200,,617,4.256410256410256
8503775,4,B006SML41I,"I enjoy doing these DVDs.  I am a runner, so I use these DVDs on my non-run days.  I found that if I do an entire DVD for one workout it works out best for me.
Grant it the audio is not the best, but who cares when your butt burns insanely for 2 days post workout?",1395964800,,264,3.6140350877192984
8503776,5,B006SML41I,"I am an analyst by nature so I do a lot of research about every purchase. I consider myself active and still found these to be a good workout. I was certainly sore and I found Erica to be very reassuring and soothing. Some have commented about being on your back. My physician was not worried and said that is a bit of an old school thought. If you can comfortably be in your back, you are fine. Once you are bigger you likely won't even be able to be in your back anyways, so I wouldn't worry. I didn't find the quality to be poor like another reviewer. A few times the audio sounds a little muffled but I hardly noticed or cared. You'll be too busy exercising it isn't distracting. My only comment is for Erica to do more videos! I would love to add a few more of her videos for added variety. So keep up the great work and thanks for the manageable half-hour-ish workouts!",1388361600,,875,4.183431952662722
