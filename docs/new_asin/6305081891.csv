Good for older teens and adults. Not for your kids - the ones who are the age YOU were when you watched ""8TH Man"".

Still......

There is a side if me that is curious as to how Marine Boy, Prince Planet, The Amazing Three and Gigantor would fare in this darker age.

And why isn't the TV series on DVD?",1173398400,2,500,3.97

7882828,5,6305081891,this is the most crazy cracked out movie u will see.,999907200,,52,3.8181818181818183
7882829,4,6305081891,"Yes, this movie does follow the ""male/female with an identity crisis, get's killed and brought back/sacrifices human body for greater good, in a slightly futuristic Tokyo setting, which then leads to much blood shed and moral issues, brought about by death of a loved one/job as a cop""  setting, but there is a reason why this is such a cliche.  It works.  Alot of the ""must see"" Anime follows this storyline.  The difference between the mediocre Anime that uses this setting, and the really great anime that uses this setting, is that the good Anime's usually don't try to do all of these parts of the setting perfect, rather make one of the parts come through so blindingly strong that you can't help but like it, for the way it just reaches out and grabs you.  In 8 Man After, it's the identity crisis and moral issues that are this strong, and i'd have to say that I can't think of any Anime Movies, and maybe two or three Anime Series, that rival it in just how well this is done.  supporting this is the nice artistry, and of course, the sheer coolness of how 8 Man's powers work.  this is not a movie you ""kinda"" like.  this is one of those movies that you love, or hate.",982972800,8,1178,4.371559633027523
7882830,4,6305081891,"This is a must see for Japanimation fans.  The plot is pretty straightforward:  cyborgs run the streets of a modern day city.  In order to stop them, a man sacrifices his humanity in order to become the 8Man,  the world's most perfect cyborg.  The movie is really graphic, with  well drawn animation violence.  The characters aren't too shallow and it  moves pretty fast.  I say go see it.",954460800,3,389,4.602941176470588
7882831,4,6305081891,"8-Man After - Perfect Collection is a great story.  Though it cuts out a few parts from the multi-set OVA, it does such a good job, you don't miss much.  No matter your taste in genre, this movie has something for you.",951091200,,218,4.166666666666667
