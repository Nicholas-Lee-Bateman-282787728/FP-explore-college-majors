2998314,5,B000X4WKG0,"Great price! Great quality! One of the best series ever made! Buy it today!
You won't regret it!",1220659200,,96,4.388888888888889
2998315,2,B000X4WKG0,"Let me start off by saying that I have no complaints about the show itself.  I purchased the Canadien release of season one prior to the U.S. editions, and have been without the remaining seasons until buying this collection.  I bought this mainly because it was cheaper than purchasing the remaining seasons that I didn't have.  Having said that, my main concern centers on the amateur authoring of the show on the discs produced by Echo Bridge (the producer of this set).

Right from the start, you'll be presented with a DVD menu that looks like it was created on a home PC with consumer software.  The screen grabs used for the menu aren't even good ones.  They are pixelated, drab, and blurry.

Speaking of pixelated and drab, that's exactly what you'll find when you begin watching the show.  The level of compression that is needed to cram six ~40min. episodes onto each of these discs is inadequate.  Even considering that this is a late 90s TV show, when compared to other television transfers (including the Canadien release of season one) it just doesn't compare.  The coloring and contrast of this series is washed out, it contains frequent picture noise, has pixelation occurring in almost every scene, and picture details are often difficult to make out.  This all looks much worse when viewing the discs upconverted on an HDTV, where all fore-mentioned blemishes are magnified.

The case the set comes in is acceptable, but not great.  The ""pages"" that hold the discs inside the case frequently detach from the spine, and will require you to snap them back in.  Also, for whatever reason the holder for the first disc is under-sized and does not actually hold the DVD in place.  In fact, when the set first arrived, disc number one was rolling around loose inside the case.  I've since put that disc in a separate storage case to keep it from getting scratched.

In the end, I am going to assume that Echo Bridge cut corners and expenses wherever possible due to the niche market that would actually be interested in purchasing this set.  For the price, I suppose this is what one should expect in terms of quality.  For some people this collection will suffice, but I hope that I have highlighted some areas that may be of concern for collectors and picky videophiles such as myself.  For the latter group, I highly recommend purchasing the Alliance Canadien issued sets that are available on Amazon.ca.  I can tell you first hand that the Alliance DVDs look much better upconverted to 1080p than their U.S. issued counterparts.",1220486400,15,2544,4.775743707093821
2998316,4,B000X4WKG0,I'm pleased with this collection of all episodes (as well as the pilot) of one of my all-time favorite shows.  The picture quality and audio are both good (much better than my old taped-off-tv videos!).  The price is exceptional for an 11-disk set.  The only feature it lacks is closed captioning.,1220227200,,297,4.784313725490196
2998317,4,B000X4WKG0,I always enjoyed this show when it was on way back when.  Now my oldest daughter is enjoying it too.  She watched all three seasons this summer. It's great that they put the three seasons together too bad they didn't just add the fourth though...,1219708800,,246,4.444444444444445
2998318,5,B000X4WKG0,It's just as great as I remember it when I watched it on TV!!  Great collection!!,1217548800,,81,4.0625
2998319,3,B000X4WKG0,"Love the show, very happy it was released. Got it as a gift to a 'hard of hearing' friend. To my surprise and dissapointment, the series was not  closed captioned/subtitled. Very unusual for a new release.",1216944000,8,205,4.694444444444445
2998320,5,B000X4WKG0,Nice that all of the episodes of Due South are collected in one set. Much easier to store and I'm enjoying watching the series again.,1212796800,2,133,4.36
2998321,5,B000X4WKG0,"FYI - Since the listing doesn't let you know specifically, Season 3 in Due South: The Ultimate Collection INCLUDES Call of the Wild Parts 1 & 2 so you don't need to purchase the separate DVD.
FANTASTIC series! If you like Paul Gross, be sure to check out Slings & Arrows, a mini-series available on DVD!",1212364800,114,303,4.428571428571429
2998322,5,B000X4WKG0,"This is one of my top five favorite series of all time, and would be #1 if not for Firefly.  Paul Gross plays the the courtious mounty with an almost reserved abandon, and I really wish that he would do more work in the U.S. like his equally excellent co-star, Callum Keith Rennie.

Though this is on the surface a fairly normal plot-driven show, centering on a mounty, Benton Fraser, who comes to Chicago on the trail of the man who killed his father, the rock-solid foundation of this show is the friendships that the constable can't help but make, and the chemistry between all of the characters, and, indeed, between all of the actors.  I could watch this show forever!",1210032000,6,673,4.545454545454546
2998323,5,B000X4WKG0,"This series is amazing!  Great comedy!  Good family fun without being stuffy or preachy.  This boxed set with seasons 1-3 also includes season 4 and the series finale ""Call of the Wild"" so there is no need to purchase it separately.",1203984000,9,232,4.609756097560975

2998328,5,B000X4WKG0,"Very pleased with the set. Other reviews talked of poor video quality, which I was concerned about when I ordered, but the price was great.  To my relief, the quality of the video is excellent for a nineties production. This is, and always will be, one of my all time favorite series. The characters, dialogue and stories are quirky, witty and a wonderful reprieve from the mainstream, which is my favorite kind of entertainment.",1424908800,,429,4.797297297297297

2998332,5,B000X4WKG0,A fantastic series collection.  The episodes as witty and enjoyable as the first time I viewed them in the late 90's.,1418774400,,117,4.571428571428571

2998334,5,B000X4WKG0,This is one of my favorite series. It is funny but clear for the whole family to enjoy. Who doesn't love a deaf dog that helps his master catch the bad guys?,1416268800,,157,3.9375
2998335,5,B000X4WKG0,"Love this show, so happy I bought it.
I remember seasons 1 and 2 from when they first aired on TV. Just watching season 3. Not sure what happened there. Different writers, directors, the replacement of one of the main actors... but the show just looses it in Season 3.  It tries to hard to be a comedy.
Sat, eyes glued to the tv for seasons 1 and 2 but find myself falling asleep every time I try to watch a season 3 episode.
Pity.",1414800000,,431,4.070588235294117
2998336,5,B000X4WKG0,"This was a show so good that despite the fact the network kept cancelling it the fans around the world went ballistic demanding its return & renewal, even if different TV networks in different countries didn't know what to do with it it found its audience or, more to the point, the audience found it when it kept being moved on the TV schedules. The best part was the fact they were able to write a satisfactory conclusion to the series. Paul Gross, David Marciano & Callum Keith Rennie, along with the rest of the cast were involved in a show with heart & humour, all playing that fine line successfully. The best thing I can suggest is buy it & watch it - you won't be disappointed.",1414800000,,685,4.359375
2998337,5,B000X4WKG0,This was really a cute show. I was sorry when it ended.,1413072000,,55,3.6666666666666665
2998338,5,B000X4WKG0,"Love the relationship with his father who has transitioned and the adventures of justice. Great series all the way through. I wish the series had gone a lot longer than it did. Makes me appreciate the series even more. Thank you Paul Haggis.

2998344,5,B000X4WKG0,"Loved the show, was sad when it's run finally ended, and overjoyed when I found it here.  Surprisingly isn't ""dated"" as much as I thought it would be, and just as enjoyable as when I first watched it.  Highly recommended!",1407974400,,221,4.5

2998346,5,B000X4WKG0,"It is a delight to watch a series that concentrates on character development rather than gaudy special effects & graphic violence. Benton Frazier, Paul Gross's character, is a Canadian mounty seeking the murderer and reasons for his father's death. Such a mundane story could have proven boring over the years this series existed, but there were some excellent things going for it. 1. There is no laugh track. A laugh track is a sign that the originators know the production is not funny. This show is funny in it's own right. 2. They employed selected actors from another of my favorite Canadian imports, Red Green Show. And the writers were brilliant. They used each actor's talents to produce a show balanced on unique, genuine characters. I didn't know it was going to take so long the first time I put on this series, but I couldn't stop. Each story is a unique experience, sort of like McGyver on steroids. Chicago was fairly realistic. If Canadians are even remotely like this, I am so sad I have never met any. .... or maybe I have, here.",1405296000,,1046,4.65945945945946

2998350,5,B000X4WKG0,"I loved Due South when I first saw it, but I missed a lot because the job I had then called for a lot of overtime.  Now I rediscovered it.  I'm glad I ordered it because I still love the series.  It was unique, so I guess it wasn't as popular as other detective series.  The package came faster than I expected, and I started watching right away.",1401580800,,346,4.044117647058823
2998351,5,B000X4WKG0,"I love Paul Gross.  This starts a little slow and geeky but after a little, I totally fell in love with the honorable values and sweetness.  The characters become close family.",1400457600,,176,4.645161290322581
2998352,5,B000X4WKG0,"I loved this series from the beginning, with all the funny relationships and crime solving is done in a different manner",1400112000,,120,4.761904761904762
2998353,5,B000X4WKG0,"We enjoyed this series when it was on TV.  So it has been fun revisiting the series again.  It is hard to find good stories, with out the bad language on any movies or show today.  Glad to have a something wholesome to watch.",1397865600,,225,4.068181818181818
2998354,5,B000X4WKG0,"This series has such great writing - witty dialogue, emotional depth, & friendship that knows no bounds. Throw in a wolf & seriously...what more could you ask for? Just watch it!",1396569600,,178,4.774193548387097
2998355,5,B000X4WKG0,"Of all series from the past, Due South is my absolute favorite.  The writers of this series were fantastic and the cast, what can I say, SUPERB!  It is obvious that these people got along not only on screen but off.  You will not regret picking up this collection!",1395792000,,264,4.346938775510204
2998356,5,B000X4WKG0,"The product description does not do this justice. Due South : The Ultimate Collection contains all FOUR seasons. This set contains the complete show. I wish I knew this before I bought season three. It's very worth it. I also like the package. Instead of individual disk cases, this package is heavy duty and contain plastic inserts for the discs. This packaging will last longer than the cardboard and flimsy disk cases.",1393891200,,421,4.861111111111111
2998357,4,B000X4WKG0,"This is a good show but there are a few questionable episodes so you might want to preview it
before you show it to young children.  Nothing extreme but it does have some cursing in it also.
If not for this, it would rate up there with Little House on the prairie.  I don't understand why directors
seem to think that it makes a show better when they put cursing in it.  It ruins a show that could be so
great.  Maybe they are afraid to stand out and go against the crowd?",1393891200,,472,4.043010752688172
2998358,5,B000X4WKG0,"This is a quirky series and the music and storylines quite unusual.  This is where I first heard ""American Woman"" which I enjoy each time I hear it.  I also bought a CD of the music...and you have to pay attention to the words in the music.",1393372800,,240,4.085106382978723
2998359,4,B000X4WKG0,"This is a great show, although the episodes can vary in quality.  It's clear that the writers were, at times, given free reign to let their imaginations go a bit crazy.  And it worked.

The actual DVDs were annoying. Instead of a clear menu, allowing you to select each episode individually, they featured the episodes in groups of three or four.

When you selected the menu item, you saw all episodes in sequence.  However, if you wanted to watch only the 2nd or 3rd item in that menu pick, it was necessary to fast-forward through the first ones.  Very annoying.",1391644800,,564,4.59
2998360,5,B000X4WKG0,Lots of fun. The wolf steals the show. Makes Canada look like a country well worth going to for the scenery -- namely the locals ;),1391212800,,131,4.076923076923077

Unfortunately I've been disappointed in Gross's depiction of the series I happened upon on youtube. He's not the gentleman he is in the series.",1389916800,,237,4.511627906976744
2998363,5,B000X4WKG0,I was very sorry to see this series go off the air.  It was different and had beautiful scenery of Canada.,1389052800,,106,4.0476190476190474
2998364,2,B000X4WKG0,"Liked the pilot. Episode one went largely back to formula TV. Tried the first episode on disc 5, and again, a couple good things but otherwise empty/superficial show. Done. Sorry.",1388361600,,179,5.0
2998365,5,B000X4WKG0,"I vaguely remembered this CBS show from the early '90s and thought it might offer good clean viewing enjoyment for children in the family. Big surprise -- it's GREAT adult entertainment, too!  Subtle wit, intelligent story lines, and meaningful character development are the mainstay of the entire series. Hilarious lines enjoy dead-pan delivery by extraordinary Canadian writer/actor/director/producer Paul Gross. In addition, this series devotes more attention to high-quality music than any other I've ever seen on American TV. It fits seamlessly with the action, either as subtle support for the story or as active accompaniment to the actors.

Constable Benton Fraser is sober-as-a-judge, a Canadian Mountie with a rigid moral backbone and a disarming manner, something rather unfamiliar to big-city law enforcement in Chicago. He's smart, talented, well-read, wholesome, unassuming, kind-hearted ... and devastatingly handsome. His backwoods Yukon upbringing makes him a fish-out-of-water when he is led south in search of his father's murderer; that said, his strength of character and sweet manner make him valuable to all he encounters.

His father's ghost visits Fraser regularly throughout the series, adding warm wisdom about the human condition, unexpected wacky wit that often flies under the radar, and knee-slapper belly-laughs to many episodes. Pure ridiculous fantasy, of course, but who among us is not haunted by a dead relative?

I highly recommend this series; it offers many hours of entertainment value for the money. It's generally good, clean fun, but does cross the line in a few places. Watch episodes first, before playing for young children.",1387584000,2,1671,5.566929133858268
2998366,5,B000X4WKG0,Ordered this for a Christmas gift but decided to keep it for myself. Am still watching but have really enjoyed it so far,1386979200,,120,4.260869565217392
2998367,5,B000X4WKG0,"First the DVDs themselves:

I don't see the moving blobs another reviewer mentioned, though the picture quality of this 1990s show is not what we have now come to expect. Either he received a defective set of discs or his utra-super-high-quality setup actually exaggerates any flaws in the quality. (I have an old TV, and the show looks fine, if a bit ""soft focus"" sometimes.) I do thank that reviewer, however, for driving the price down to under $12 a set.

Admittedly, the navigation of these discs is clunky. There's no way to ""play all,"" for instance. But for this price, I'll click a few extra buttons.

Now the show:

Paul Gross is utterly charming as the do-gooding Canadian Mounty out of his element in Chicago. The humor of the series is often dry, sometimes droll, and occasionally slapstick. The sentiment is a bit mawkish at times, but worth tolerating for the comedy. It's a very family-safe show that at the same time has appeal for virtually all audiences.",1386979200,4,972,4.733727810650888
2998368,3,B000X4WKG0,"I would give this an exact HALF of the full 5-star review. I know I likely wouldn't have bought this if I'd known what it was exactly. I went by another reviewer, who said it did include ALL FOUR SEASONS, because I wanted a FULL SERIES SET, not just the 3 Seasons that the title and description claims.
Well, I already had the first TWO Seasons, so the only way this was worth buying was to have a full Series Set, all 4 Seasons, in ONE BOX. I am fairly disappointed. While this set does contain what appears to be the full Series worth of episodes, it makes NO distinction of a season 4 even existing, and sort of blends all the episodes into one boxed set, then chops it into 3 parts. Besides that, there is NO mention, images, or sign anywhere in the artwork, summary, booklet, disk art, etc. of the 'Ray' that was played by Callum Keith Rennie in the 3rd and 4th seasons! The box and disks all contain David Marciano only.
All in all, I guess I am glad to have all the episodes on disk, and I will just have to explain if anyone wants to borrow it or watch with me, that there really IS a 4th season somewhere in there. I have yet to notice that this set contains ANY 'Special Features', and from what I read, the video quality isn't the best either. I did grow up with VHS and the dawn of the DVD, so I am not a die-hard 1080p HD video person, but it would be nice to have better quality than what was on the old recorded VHS tapes.
The casing isn't too awfully bad, considering how some are whining about the disks all being in one case, and how they had loose disks. I luckily, had NO disk damage, and all were secure upon arrival.
By the way, I was NOT happy with the S L O W Shipping Speed!! I noticed it was shipped late, sat in Compton for a week, then sat in Kentucky for 4 days, and arrives 6 days late. The packaging was very sub-par, but I was lucky the case had no cracks or damage. And this is to express the service of the seller, not the product. Be careful who you buy from.",1386806400,,1994,4.076335877862595
2998369,5,B000X4WKG0,"Outstanding!! The Brits and Canadians sure can make good films ( TV or Movies) and this series is truly one of the best. The combination of detective sleuthing and quirky characters as well as a fabulous Mountie and a fantastic dog are all elements that make this series so enjoyable. Just regret that it couldn't have continued. Fraser  ( played by Paul Gross ) is not only really handsome and ""kind"" he's a fabulous actor. As a  Mountie Fraser leaves the snow covered peaks of the Canadian Rockies to pursue a killer somewhere in Chicago .Although gun-less, quick wit, fantastic running skills, ability to leap from roof tops to rooftops & many other "" gracious"" but manly feats""  usually help Fraser & partner Ray & the fearless Dieffenbaker (dog) to almost always get their man, or in some cases their woman.

2998372,5,B000X4WKG0,"All three seasons in one package. They are all in the same big plastic case so beware loose DVDs. I really like this series. Paul Gross and Callum Keith Rennie are very good actors. I am a RayK fan, not a RayV fan, but it's nice to know that I can just open the case and pull out any DVD and watch either Ray act it up with Fraser. The quality isn't as good as modern shows, but that's because it was filmed in the 90's. This is the complete series, you don't have to buy any other DVD sets.",1381881600,,491,3.92
2998373,5,B000X4WKG0,"due south was a favorite of mine back when it originally aired.  i never got to see the last season, save for a few episodes i bought on vhs a while back.  i already had the first two seasons on dvd, but when i saw this deal,  all 68 episodes PLUS the tv pilot movie for one outrageously low price, i jumped on it.  and i am glad i did.  sure the compression from slapping so many episodes on eleven discs is sometimes noticeable, but, hey, for a deal like this, who cares?  personally, i think the compression looked worse on my season two set, far more noticeable, than on the eps on this set.  when they re-did all the episodes for this ultimate set, i think they did a much better job.  if you are a due south fan, this is definitely worth the money.  if you have never seen this fine series, you should check it out.",1381708800,,821,4.113207547169812

Constable Benton Frasier comes to Chicago to hunt down the killers of his Mounty father. Able to track men over shear ice, everybody thinks that the big bad city will eat him alive. Yet he works his magic, and can track suspects around the city.

The series have plenty of humour, fun and suspense to keep you interested. There is a lot of gentle digs at the US/ Canadian relationship with Frasier's politeness, and the US love of guns and such.

It is a feel good series without the violence and grit normally associated with a cop show. That does not mean it is not a great show, it is, it just does it in an unique way.",1377043200,,704,4.2781954887218046

2998385,3,B000X4WKG0,"I never saw Due South in its run on CBS, but I had gotten a couple disks from Netflix and thought, what the heck, i'll take a flyer and buy this set. No, they're not the most beautifully produced DVDs, but they're not bad, and the price can't be beat.

Season 1 takes a while to find its way; the creative team couldn't seem to decide whether this was a comedy or a drama, and didn't do either spectacularly well. I was about to give up, but kept watching anyway because I think the dog is one of the great character actors of our time. (Really - the dog alone is worth watching.)  The last few shows in season 1 are very much worth watching; I'm not going to give anything away. The show hits its stride in season 2; while there are elements of drama, the show is quietly very funny. The really hilarious thing is, everyone is a straight man; watching the characters play off one another, with none of it played for laughs, is quite a treat.

My favorite line: Ray and Benton are present as Benton's boss throws herself at a man. Ray whispers to Benton, She wants him. Benton turns to Ray and says, For what? Hmmm... doesn't look that funny in print, but the way it was done had me laughing out loud.

*******

I had written the above review when I'd only gotten through the first two seasons; for those two seasons, the above still stands.

The third season is a mess. The new Ray, and the writing around the new Ray, took quite a while to find their way. Spy vs. Spy is good, largely due to Martha Burns as a Russian terrorist - she's really a treat to watch. After that, the shows are okay but not great, until you get to the last disk. For the last few shows, Ray 2 is in his element, and the shows are a lot better.

Call of the Wild is a treat. Not going to say any more about it except that Leslie Nielsen is back, and he steals every scene he's in (that's a good thing). These two shows almost make it worth having slogged through the rest of season 3.

A couple minor quibbles with the production: I'm in Chicago, but I'm familiar with Toronto. They shot enough B roll of Chicago to do a passable job of making it look like Chicago. That is, it looked vaguely like Chicago until a car would go flying down a street, and I'd notice that the parked cars had Ontario plates. Or a shopping center sign spelled ""centre"" - something you don't see much around here. Then there was the gas station sign where the price was obviously a per-liter price, as gas here hasn't been 51 cents since the mid-70s. Or a recognizable Toronto landmark showing up as, say, the Cook County courthouse. Or the subway that's a lot nicer looking than the genuine article.  If things like this bother you, they will drive you insane here. At least the mailboxes were blue.

On average, if I could give half a star, I'd give this 3 and a half stars. I suppose the less-good shows would have been good enough, but the really good shows are SO good, it makes the more average shows look pretty bad. The series as a whole is worth watching, but I very nearly lost patience with some of it. If you quit after season 2, I'll understand, but you'll miss Call of the Wild, so please watch the whole thing.",1373241600,3,3180,4.25

2998390,3,B000X4WKG0,"The show itself is one of my favorite shows of the 90s. Due South has some fantastic characters, great comedy, and it has some good action as well. They absolutely love to have fun with Canadian and American stereotypes (especially how polite Canadians are), have plenty of fun with sticking a Mountie out of his element in the middle of Chicago, and this show is just plain good family fun. It's a real shame that they didn't make more of it.

As for this particular release, I'd advise against picking it up unless you just want the show cheap and don't care about video quality. The video has been way, _way_ over-compressed. They have too many episodes per disc, and the result is that the video is highly pixelated. It's the worst quality that I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. On the bright side, it's cheap, so if you don't want to pay much, then you can get the whole series for cheap, but you get what you pay for.

If you really want this show at decent quality, I would advise picking up the Canadian releases of the show. It comes in 4 parts and unfortunately costs at least 4 times as much, but you actually get good quality with that release. You can pick them up at amazon (the full set can currently be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-South-4-pack-Season-1-2-3-PlusThe-Final-Season/dp/B000BVMVQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due South (4 pack) Season 1,2,3 PlusThe Final Season</a>), or you might be able to find them at amazon.ca for somewhat cheaper depending on what the exact pricing looks like when you read this. But I seriously regret having picked up this release, and as soon as I figured out what was going on, I picked up the Canadian one, and I don't regret it one bit.

Just wondered about the laws of NYS owning a dog that has possibly 50% or less wolf in their breeding.  For a fact, I've never heard of any problems with them.

Took a while but I watched from start to finish, laughing at the lines, enjoying the terrific writing and the acting is great.  This time I noticed some of the guest appearances (didn't know who they were in the 90's) except of course, Leslie Nielsen.  The humor (the mounties singing on the train) made me laugh out loud.

Paul Gross plays Benton in such a natural way and never once abandons his character.  He's as crisp and clean in the last episode as he was in the first.

2998424,5,B000X4WKG0,"This show was a twist on the ""buddy cop"" movies/tv series.  It was initially meant to be just a two-part made for TV movie, but it did well enough that it was turned into a series.  Chances are anyone who is reading this already knows the story, so I will not rehash that too much.  They did very well with the ""fish out of water"" story.  The show blended elements of comedy, drama and action perfectly.

The key to the show was that it was always well acted.  Even in the last season after David Marciano left and the story became a little more campy, the acting was always great.  One thing I had forgotten was how many guest appearances were made on the show.  Leslie Nielsen was the big one, who appeared in a few different episodes.  But Ryan Phillipe and Mark Ruffalo also guest starred in very early roles for both of them.

I originally thought that the show should have gone on longer, but after watching the series again from beginning to end, I think that the show went out at exactly the right time.  It told as many stories as possible, without getting extremely repetitive.  It was definitely a show that was always being kept alive.  It barely got a second season on CBS, then survived a couple more in syndication.

In the end I felt it did a fine job wrapping up everyone's stories, and leaving the ""continued adventures"" to the imagination.  It was one of the best series on the air at the time.  It did not rely on gratuitous sex and violence to be entertaining.  The stories always had a point, and the acting was great.

But Echo Bridge has slaughtered it by SERIOUSLY overcompressing the video. I bought this set thinking it was surprisingly cheap, and then understood why. Echo Bridge has compressed the episodes to such an extent that pixelation appears in every intense action scene for the first couple of seasons and pixelation almost obliterates the images for any scene with motion in seasons three and four. It's a travesty! And it's not because the show's old. I have DVDs of TV shows from the eighties that look FAR better. And Alliance Atlantis, the people releasing the Canadian version of Due South, did NOT overcompress the video so there is NO pixelation for any of the episodes, regardless of season.

2998440,4,B000X4WKG0,"Due South is a good clean fun, I enjoy it.  Imagine Dudley Do-Right and Snidley Whiplash as two very different cops teamed up to fight crime in Chicago.

Episodes are over 40 minutes long, it was an hour long show and now the commercials have been deleted.  Sixty eight episodes are included in the set, the back cover says 52 hours of playing time.  Six and ocasionally seven episodes are crammed onto each of eleven disks so the video quality is OK but not great.  Keep in mind that in the 80's most shows were broadcast from video tape instead of film so the video quality on the disks is similar to what you would have seen on TV when the show was first broadcast.

For me the good stories make Due South worth watching.  The video and audio quality is still good with a progressive scan DVD player connected to my 32 inch HDTV, it does not interfere with watching the show.  I still prefer to enjoy watching a good story, even if it's in black and white, over a poor story with a lot of spectacular special effects.

It would be nice if the case was better, but I always put these sets with oversized cases in 6 disc silm cases.

The only thing I do wish this collection had is a Play All feature.  At least they don't have three or four screens of warnings and disclaimers that you can't skip or fast forward through.  Those take too long and is anyone really going to read them anyway? Those screens are just annoying.

2998447,4,B000X4WKG0,"A friend of mine has the ""Ultimate"" US release featured on this page. I collected the original Canadian sets as they were released. Seen both. I wrote the following as Amazon commentary on the US releases of individual seasons. Still stand by it.

True, the US sets are cheaper than the Canada sets (though if you buy the Canada sets from Amazon.ca, they're LOTS cheaper than buying them as imports from Amazon.com). True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.

However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations). And finally --

-- small thing though it may be --

-- the Canadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.

I won't tell you not to save the dough on the American release, I empathize ... I'll only tell you, the Canadian sets have more vibrant sound and video. And in the end, it's what's ON the DVD that matters the most ... isn't it?",1285372800,64,2338,4.624096385542169

There were those who were unhappy with the ""video"" quality.  The set is not advertised for it's HD quality or Surround sound effects.  The set is of good quality despite the mastering/compression used.  The content is the majority of the cost of the set, anyway.  I have seen other more popular movies/series that are of less quality overall than what people have complained about this one.  There are more factors at play than simply the compression used to master the disc.  The type of player you use as well as the TV it is viewed on will affect the overall ""viewing"" quality as well.  I use a $20 DVD player connect to an HD TV via RCA connections.  I have not experienced only a slight bit of pixelation when viewing a couple of episodes and only one or two glitches in overall playback.  I am simply happy to have found an enjoyable program that is still available.  I am sure that a super high quality edition could be produced and distributed on a 4 episode per disc format.  This would simply translate into a 17 disc set, most likely in a 2 or 3 case format and be likely to cost 2 to 3 times more than the currently available option.  The set is well put together and priced right.  If you have ever watched any of the episodes or all of them on TV and enjoyed the series then this is a good buy for you.

I had watched 'Due South' some months ago after reading what a great show it was. After renting it, i HAD to have it!
This is the best and most affordable box set there is!
Yes it is the COMPLETE series. There are those that are confused, seeing as on tv there were 4 seasons, but not to worry. They just combined season 4 with season's 3; so really, you do get ALL the episodes.
There are no special features to this, just the episodes, and sometimes you may see the image pixel slightly, but only if you're looking for it. It's hardly noticeable, otherwise the picture and quality are great. (the only reason i looked for it, was because i had read a previous reviewer mention it. i had wanted to see if it was true) Not bad for such an affordable price.
There is one episode that might drive you crazy though. It's the one called 'Eclipse' on season 3. It's so dark, that at times you don't see the actors; but that has nothing to do with the quality of the disk. That's all to the show's crew bad lighting skills; and only during which they are in a building. Once outside, it's perfect. Thought i'd get a heads up for that episode, in defense for the rest of the set.
The 'Call of the Wild' episodes (the last 2 for the series finale) has been made into a sepriate movie disk. Please don't buy that if you brought the box set. It's the SAME EXACT EPISODES! I've read other reveiwers say this time and time again, but 'duh-duh' me didn't believe them, thinking there might be more to the disk that the set didn't provide. It doesn't. Leave it be people, leave it be!

Diefenbaker, of course, is not really a wolf but plays one on the show.

When I finally gave in, the price was so great here at Amazon I could not pass it up. On sale, the complete series was the same price as the purchase of a single season.  Who could pass that up?

Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The videos came in a really nice book like case each with its own page.  All are will marked and stay where you put them.

The quality of the video and sound is no worse or different than when it originally aired on TV. I have watched the videos on a 19"" Flat screen LCD / traditional 32"" TV and a 32"" flat screen LCD TV and have yet to see any issues with picture or sound quality.

Due South was enjoyable when I watched it all those years ago and unlike many TV shows from my youth, I still like it all these years later.  Paul Gross and the rest of the cast are fantastic.

2. Yes, the picture quality isn't as great as, say, the Homicide: LOTS DVDs that are out there, but it isn't a ripoff. I watched these on a big widescreen HD TV and the video looked fine, great even; there were one or two points where, yeah, there was a little video interference, but it never interrupted the show, and again--it's a great show, and this is a great price. The video on my TV was, to be honest, much better quality than I expected.

Now, as a side note, playing on a portable DVD player? The image got a little pixelated on and off, but I think that's just that player and the way it reads discs.

This set is totally worth it; or at least, it was to me. I can't not smile when watching this show.

3. I was a little confused when I bought this, since to my knowledge there had been four seasons. This set IS all four of the seasons, there's just odd labeling.

Also -- up above, you might see this set being offered with the ""Call of the Wild"" set? Yeah, don't click that. This set has the Call of the Wild episodes on it. So. Yeah.

Aside from the crappy menu, they also have the first Vecchio on the disks containing the third season (when Kowalski was undercover as Vecchio and Vecchio was barely even there).
Now there's also the matter of the amount of episodes per disk. For this you have to consider two things. One I paid 20 dollars for Four seasons. Two this show was produced in 1994 to 1996 for the first two seasons, and 1996 to 1999 for the last two. If you've watched reruns of old 90's shows (like the first couple seasons of X-files 1993...) then you know the quality's not great. So the first couple seasons of Due South aren't that great either, though the last two seasons are better. The haven't been enhanced, but they also only cost 20 dollars so... you get what you pay for. If you really want to hold out in case they decided to release an enhanced version you can do that. Or if you're able to buy the Canadian version (which I've heard is better) then do that. BTW the USA release of Due South has 4 seasons, the Canadian 3 (but it's the same episodes, only the third season was split in two for some reason.) Oh and don't buy Call of the Wild because it's included. In the end you get 4(USA)/3(CA) seasons, and the follow up movie. It's not enhanced, and the quality of film shows it's age. But it's only 20 dollars and how many people have bought a new movie for 20 only to hate it, or end up watch it few times before leaving it to gather dust on a shelf somewhere. At least most people buying this series already like it. In the end, I read up on the product, knew basicly what I was getting, found a price I was willing to pay from seller with a 95% or higher rating and was content with what I got even if I did exerience an urge to smack the person or persons that thought Peach was a good font color. Oh, and ratio of the film is weird, it a square in the middle with black on either side. I guess I should be glad it's not peach on either side. Seriously people, I will redesign the menu for free if you let me.",1255996800,4,2275,4.1376975169300225

2998475,5,B000X4WKG0,"Due South was great show that was severly underrated. I loved this show when it was on and was able to re-discover that love through Netflix. When I spotted the collection on Amazon I knew I had to have it. Paul Gross' portrayal of Constable Benton Fraser of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was charming, funny, whimsical, sexy & nieve at the same time. The humor of the show was classic and still makes me giggle. Although Constable Fraser first came to Chicago on the trail of his father's killers, he was able to stay on our tvs for 3 seasons.  I know that Due South will stay in my heart forever.  I will always see that Canadian Red Mounty uniform and picture Fraser standing there with the loveable Defenbaker at his side.  I highly recommend this box set for any true Due South fan.

2998488,4,B000X4WKG0,"For some reason or other--pig-headedness, probably, or a warts and all desire not to run with the crowd--I'm usually about a decade behind on TV series.  I'm usually not a fan of the big hits.

I'm finally watching ""Due South"" courtesy of Netflix. It revolves around the adventures of a police odd couple, a Mountie (descended about equally from Dudley-Do-Right and Sgt. Preston) and a cynical, not-so-very-by-the-book Chicago Detective.  The Mountie, Constable Benton Frazer, has a ""pet"" wolf. It sleeps in his bed, while Frazier sleeps in a pristine boy scout bed-roll, on the floor.

I have to admit, I've just completed viewing the first year. At first, DS had me genre-confused, then I realized it's cheerfully playing the field. In the beginning, it seemed to be old time T.V. with a happy-ending, clearly never meant to be taken too seriously, targeting the ""Murder She Wrote"" demographic + Canadian jokes. Some episodes were just plain witty, and with a wry, dry, off-kilter Pythonlike humor. Others, with street kids and dogs, were sort of corny, with plots which strained even this old lady's credulity. Nevertheless, the opening shot of Constable Frazier marching into Chicago-- with his boots, backpack and animal companion wolf--is poignant. He's the classic Stranger in a Strange Land, an (only slightly saner) Don Quixote RCMP.

I'm getting soft in my old age, but it's uplifting to enter--if only through the suspension of belief required by theater--a reality where honesty, knowledge, industry, creative thinking and optimism carry the day. I've grown to LOVE these characters, especially, (and just like all the women who populate this series) I love the Constable! This guy needs lots and lots of cookies--and a good woman to take care of him.

And just as I'm thinking that, Blam! The ""Victoria's Secret"" episodes! Suddenly, it's all romantic tragedy, with bare skin on Hudson Bay Blankets, and an old flame almost getting the Constable killed. I was floored by the change, but definitely will continue watching.

Due South is highly character driven, and the plots sometimes suffer, particularly as the '90's are getting to be ancient history, but I've got a weakness for charming off-beat characters. ""Due South"" has plenty, as well as the wolf sidekick, who is by turns trusty police dog and/or obnoxious roommate. There are ghosts, too, more often than ""Hamlet.""

BTW, wonder if the video quality earlier reviews have mentioned result from some scenes (apparently) being shot in video tape instead of film. Sometimes the cutting together of these very different textures and photographic capability give the viewer an unpleasant jolt. However, I'm no expert, so could be wrong about this being the reason for ""poor quality"" others have spoken of.

Anyway--I really am enjoying this series!  A LOT of bang for the buck here.",1232409600,,2848,5.1317494600431965
2998489,5,B000X4WKG0,"I read the reviews on this site before I purchased this and really did not find them very informative, mainly because all I really wanted to know was if all the seasons were actually combined together for such a low price - it was on sale for about $20.  And the answer is YES!  All the seasons are in the one set.  There's about 6 episodes on each disc, which is fine.  One review I read was complaining about the quality and I honestly haven't had a problem with it all; however, I'm not particular in that area either.  Everything so far appears to be clear and I haven't had a problem watching the episodes.

I had heard that this was an enjoyable series, but since it is a Canadian show which I had never seen any of (and I live in the US), I was a bit leery about buying without having seen some episodes at least, but I couldn't pass it up for the above price.  I've watched the pilot and a few episodes so far; therefore, I still have a long way to go, but I have been pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable the series is.  It's a bit cheesy, but the humor is alot of fun.  It's obviously a low budget series, but I wasn't expecting a bunch of neat special effects and that's not what I wanted. The series appears to be well written and enjoyable and that is definitely good enough for me.

Paul Haggis is the creator and the writer for the first two seasons.  I think the clever writing is what makes the show so timeless.

Due South was the first time I heard Canadian singer, Sarah McClanchlan's voice in the background on the 3 episodes about Fraser's one love, Victoria...  Fantastic!  Due South uses many Canadian actors and singers.

My girls are young teenagers and they love watching the DVDs as much as I do.  In fact, we got a puppy in October and named him Fraser... he has a red collar like a Canadian Mountie!

I've really enjoyed all four seasons!  I would highly recommend it.  However, the quality of the DVDs is not perfect.  I had three episodes that ""locked up"" on me while watching the DVDs.  I contacted Amazon and they were amazing to work with.  In the end, I received another DVD set, and still had problems viewing but it was with different DVD.

I want to echo what others have said here. Yes, the price for the complete collection is right but with the price comes poor packaging (I have received two of the complete collections--a set and a replacement for the damaged set--and in both the first disc in set came off the spindle), scratched DVDs (in the two sets about 1/4 of the discs were scratched and looked used), poor picture quality (too many episodes squeezed on to too few discs still it could be far worse), video stops and starts, audio dropouts, and horizontal lines in the picture frame at one point.

If you like this series as I do and you have an all-region DVD player and the money go for the Network box set from the UK. The picture quality is far superior and so is the packaging. I have also heard excellent things about the French TF1 releases that have come out thus far.

2998501,1,B000X4WKG0,"DUE SOUTH: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION has got to be the worst quality commercial DVD I've ever seen.  I was really looking forward to watching this series for the first time.  68 episodes for $30 didn't seem suspicious since I figured it's a little-known show that probably underperformed for the DVD studio in season sets, so they decided to burn off their investment in one affordable mega-set.  When I saw the first disc my blood ran ice cold:  6 TV hours on one DVD?  Okay, most TV sets won't break a 4-episode per disc limit or risk some serious image compression issues.  Fancy sets will do 2 or 3 per disc which in my opinion generates a reference quality picture.  I thumbed through the rest of the discs and would have laughed had I not broke the manufacturer's shrinkwrap, thereby making a refund impossible:  Some discs in this set contain a whopping 7 episodes!!!  I skimmed through some of the episodes on disc 1:  Despite the fact that this is an older show (pre-HD), and the image is naturally soft, there is expectedly HEAVY PIXELATION.  Whenever someone or something moves, they turn into a blob of compression.  Cars, people... in this shameful presentation, the show can't even fade out or in from black without turning into a videophile's nightmare.  Cursing, I inserted a disc with 7 episodes -- morbid curiosity at this point.  The cast can't even walk down a hall without the picture turning into a substandard digital cable parody.  I suppose the math of the issue should have occurred to me: 68 episodes divided by 11 discs = VCD quality.  Too late.  So tell me, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment: What's the point of putting a show on DVD if it would look better on VHS?  Thanks for disrespecting what I understand is a truly great show, and thanks for ripping me off.  Have a nice day.",1221264000,130,1806,4.640378548895899
2998502,5,B000X4WKG0,"For those of you who haven't seen a single episode of Due South and need some clues as to what kind of show this is, I'll give it a shot.  I wouldn't be surprised if this show was cancelled simply because it doesn't fit neatly into a particular category and would be hard to pitch to execs.

My teenaged kids' favorite character is Diefenbaker, the beautiful dog you see on the cover.  He's deaf, supposedly can read lips, and has engaging storylines that center around him.  Working with animals in a production is extremely difficult to do.  I'm impressed by Diefenbaker and always look forward to his presence in the show.  He's described as wolf that decided to live with Fraser (the mountie) and went deaf when he saved Fraser's life in a water rescue.  This is a comedy and I find it easy to set aside any quibbles with the chances of this happening, although it's my understanding that sometimes people who own sled dogs and live in the far north have wolves interact with their dogs and even become somewhat friendly toward the people if they're fed.  Diefenbaker is a big step up from the dog heroes I enjoyed as a child.  He is very much as fully realized a character as any of the other leads.

My favorite character is Fraser.  I've always had a fondness for the innocent, brave and ultra-polite stereotypical image of 'Mounties' and Fraser doesn't disappoint with his sometimes comical adherence to the strict letter of the law and his rarely fallible capability to track down bad guys in any terrain.  I believe his mother was a librarian if I remember correctly, or maybe it was a grandparent.  This is the excuse the writers use to turn Fraser into a kind of living encyclopedia.  The pilot says it all as Fraser brings in the bad guy in a bad storm by sled for illegal fishing.  You have to see the show to get the punchline, and how he ends up in Chicago is a fun set up.

Vecchio, Fraser's Chicago partner, is the jaded cop on the verge of being a screw-up that offsets Fraser's straight role.  He loves his car too much, loves his clothes too much and doesn't do much to fight crime until Fraser comes along.  At his heart Vecchio wants to do well but clearly hasn't an idea of how to go about it.  He's too much of an adult to have Fraser become his role model, but by their interactions and Vecchio's increasing success in crime fighting he quickly develops into a force to be reckoned with.  He's not exactly comic relief.  His role is more complex than that.  Every character, including Vecchio's sister, is comical and exaggerated in some way, but they also have a heart that we all aspire to find within ourselves that's unbreakable and untaintable.  The writers play with this idea a great deal, tempting these iconic characters to sully themselves, but they don't, and it's a beautiful thing.

Fun secondary characters abound, including the ghosts of the fathers of Fraser and Vecchio.  The writers rarely miss an opportunity to make a side character make us want to laugh even as the viewer becomes engaged in the crime-solving storyline.  The crimes aren't particularly campy, nor is the crime-solving.  It's more of a dry comedy with some serious moments.  It is extremely family friendly with very limited violence, although some very young children may be concerned or disturbed about animals in danger, especially the horses/slaughterhouse episode where there are hanging carcasses and they may correctly interpret that those are meant to depict horse carcasses.

I have no complaints about the quality of the DVDs themselves.  The case is solid and holds the DVDs well.  There weren't any loose on arrival.",1220832000,4,3641,4.686614173228347

You won't regret it!",1220659200,,96,4.388888888888889
3232812,2,B000X4WKG0,"Let me start off by saying that I have no complaints about the show itself.  I purchased the Canadien release of season one prior to the U.S. editions, and have been without the remaining seasons until buying this collection.  I bought this mainly because it was cheaper than purchasing the remaining seasons that I didn't have.  Having said that, my main concern centers on the amateur authoring of the show on the discs produced by Echo Bridge (the producer of this set).

Right from the start, you'll be presented with a DVD menu that looks like it was created on a home PC with consumer software.  The screen grabs used for the menu aren't even good ones.  They are pixelated, drab, and blurry.

Speaking of pixelated and drab, that's exactly what you'll find when you begin watching the show.  The level of compression that is needed to cram six ~40min. episodes onto each of these discs is inadequate.  Even considering that this is a late 90s TV show, when compared to other television transfers (including the Canadien release of season one) it just doesn't compare.  The coloring and contrast of this series is washed out, it contains frequent picture noise, has pixelation occurring in almost every scene, and picture details are often difficult to make out.  This all looks much worse when viewing the discs upconverted on an HDTV, where all fore-mentioned blemishes are magnified.

The case the set comes in is acceptable, but not great.  The ""pages"" that hold the discs inside the case frequently detach from the spine, and will require you to snap them back in.  Also, for whatever reason the holder for the first disc is under-sized and does not actually hold the DVD in place.  In fact, when the set first arrived, disc number one was rolling around loose inside the case.  I've since put that disc in a separate storage case to keep it from getting scratched.

In the end, I am going to assume that Echo Bridge cut corners and expenses wherever possible due to the niche market that would actually be interested in purchasing this set.  For the price, I suppose this is what one should expect in terms of quality.  For some people this collection will suffice, but I hope that I have highlighted some areas that may be of concern for collectors and picky videophiles such as myself.  For the latter group, I highly recommend purchasing the Alliance Canadien issued sets that are available on Amazon.ca.  I can tell you first hand that the Alliance DVDs look much better upconverted to 1080p than their U.S. issued counterparts.",1220486400,15,2544,4.775743707093821

Paul Gross plays the the courtious mounty with an almost reserved abandon, and I really wish that he would do more work in the U.S. like his equally excellent co-star, Callum Keith Rennie.

Though this is on the surface a fairly normal plot-driven show, centering on a mounty, Benton Fraser, who comes to Chicago on the trail of the man who killed his father, the rock-solid foundation of this show is the friendships that the constable can't help but make, and the chemistry between all of the characters, and, indeed, between all of the actors.

The best part was the fact they were able to write a satisfactory conclusion to the series.

Benton Frazier, Paul Gross's character, is a Canadian mounty seeking the murderer and reasons for his father's death. Such a mundane story could have proven boring over the years this series existed, but there were some excellent things going for it. 1. There is no laugh track. A laugh track is a sign that the originators know the production is not funny. This show is funny in it's own right. 2. They employed selected actors from another of my favorite Canadian imports, Red Green Show. And the writers were brilliant. They used each actor's talents to produce a show balanced on unique, genuine characters. I didn't know it was going to take so long the first time I put on this series, but I couldn't stop. Each story is a unique experience, sort of like McGyver on steroids. Chicago was fairly realistic.

The actual DVDs were annoying. Instead of a clear menu, allowing you to select each episode individually, they featured the episodes in groups of three or four.

When you selected the menu item, you saw all episodes in sequence.  However, if you wanted to watch only the 2nd or 3rd item in that menu pick, it was necessary to fast-forward through the first ones.  Very annoying.",1391644800,,564,4.59

3232862,5,B000X4WKG0,"I vaguely remembered this CBS show from the early '90s and thought it might offer good clean viewing enjoyment for children in the family. Big surprise -- it's GREAT adult entertainment, too!  Subtle wit, intelligent story lines, and meaningful character development are the mainstay of the entire series. Hilarious lines enjoy dead-pan delivery by extraordinary Canadian writer/actor/director/producer Paul Gross. In addition, this series devotes more attention to high-quality music than any other I've ever seen on American TV. It fits seamlessly with the action, either as subtle support for the story or as active accompaniment to the actors.

Constable Benton Fraser is sober-as-a-judge, a Canadian Mountie with a rigid moral backbone and a disarming manner, something rather unfamiliar to big-city law enforcement in Chicago. He's smart, talented, well-read, wholesome, unassuming, kind-hearted ... and devastatingly handsome. His backwoods Yukon upbringing makes him a fish-out-of-water when he is led south in search of his father's murderer; that said, his strength of character and sweet manner make him valuable to all he encounters.

His father's ghost visits Fraser regularly throughout the series, adding warm wisdom about the human condition, unexpected wacky wit that often flies under the radar, and knee-slapper belly-laughs to many episodes. Pure ridiculous fantasy, of course, but who among us is not haunted by a dead relative?

I highly recommend this series; it offers many hours of entertainment value for the money. It's generally good, clean fun, but does cross the line in a few places. Watch episodes first, before playing for young children.",1387584000,2,1671,5.566929133858268

3232864,5,B000X4WKG0,"First the DVDs themselves:

I don't see the moving blobs another reviewer mentioned, though the picture quality of this 1990s show is not what we have now come to expect. Either he received a defective set of discs or his utra-super-high-quality setup actually exaggerates any flaws in the quality. (I have an old TV, and the show looks fine, if a bit ""soft focus"" sometimes.) I do thank that reviewer, however, for driving the price down to under $12 a set.

Admittedly, the navigation of these discs is clunky. There's no way to ""play all,"" for instance. But for this price, I'll click a few extra buttons.

Now the show:

Paul Gross is utterly charming as the do-gooding Canadian Mounty out of his element in Chicago. The humor of the series is often dry, sometimes droll, and occasionally slapstick. The sentiment is a bit mawkish at times, but worth tolerating for the comedy. It's a very family-safe show that at the same time has appeal for virtually all audiences.",1386979200,4,972,4.733727810650888
3232865,3,B000X4WKG0,"I would give this an exact HALF of the full 5-star review. I know I likely wouldn't have bought this if I'd known what it was exactly. I went by another reviewer, who said it did include ALL FOUR SEASONS, because I wanted a FULL SERIES SET, not just the 3 Seasons that the title and description claims.
Well, I already had the first TWO Seasons, so the only way this was worth buying was to have a full Series Set, all 4 Seasons, in ONE BOX. I am fairly disappointed. While this set does contain what appears to be the full Series worth of episodes, it makes NO distinction of a season 4 even existing, and sort of blends all the episodes into one boxed set, then chops it into 3 parts. Besides that, there is NO mention, images, or sign anywhere in the artwork, summary, booklet, disk art, etc. of the 'Ray' that was played by Callum Keith Rennie in the 3rd and 4th seasons! The box and disks all contain David Marciano only.
All in all, I guess I am glad to have all the episodes on disk, and I will just have to explain if anyone wants to borrow it or watch with me, that there really IS a 4th season somewhere in there. I have yet to notice that this set contains ANY 'Special Features', and from what I read, the video quality isn't the best either. I did grow up with VHS and the dawn of the DVD, so I am not a die-hard 1080p HD video person, but it would be nice to have better quality than what was on the old recorded VHS tapes.
The casing isn't too awfully bad, considering how some are whining about the disks all being in one case, and how they had loose disks. I luckily, had NO disk damage, and all were secure upon arrival.
By the way, I was NOT happy with the S L O W Shipping Speed!! I noticed it was shipped late, sat in Compton for a week, then sat in Kentucky for 4 days, and arrives 6 days late. The packaging was very sub-par, but I was lucky the case had no cracks or damage. And this is to express the service of the seller, not the product.

As a  Mountie Fraser leaves the snow covered peaks of the Canadian Rockies to pursue a killer somewhere in Chicago .Although gun-less, quick wit, fantastic running skills, ability to leap from roof tops to rooftops & many other "" gracious"" but manly feats""  usually help Fraser & partner Ray & the fearless Dieffenbaker (dog) to almost always get their man, or in some cases their woman.

Constable Benton Frasier comes to Chicago to hunt down the killers of his Mounty father. Able to track men over shear ice, everybody thinks that the big bad city will eat him alive. Yet he works his magic, and can track suspects around the city.

The series have plenty of humour, fun and suspense to keep you interested. There is a lot of gentle digs at the US/ Canadian relationship with Frasier's politeness, and the US love of guns and such.

It is a feel good series without the violence and grit normally associated with a cop show. That does not mean it is not a great show, it is, it just does it in an unique way.",1377043200,,704,4.2781954887218046

3232882,3,B000X4WKG0,"I never saw Due South in its run on CBS, but I had gotten a couple disks from Netflix and thought, what the heck, i'll take a flyer and buy this set. No, they're not the most beautifully produced DVDs, but they're not bad, and the price can't be beat.

Season 1 takes a while to find its way; the creative team couldn't seem to decide whether this was a comedy or a drama, and didn't do either spectacularly well. I was about to give up, but kept watching anyway because I think the dog is one of the great character actors of our time. (Really - the dog alone is worth watching.)  The last few shows in season 1 are very much worth watching; I'm not going to give anything away. The show hits its stride in season 2; while there are elements of drama, the show is quietly very funny. The really hilarious thing is, everyone is a straight man; watching the characters play off one another, with none of it played for laughs, is quite a treat.

My favorite line: Ray and Benton are present as Benton's boss throws herself at a man. Ray whispers to Benton, She wants him. Benton turns to Ray and says, For what? Hmmm... doesn't look that funny in print, but the way it was done had me laughing out loud.

*******

I had written the above review when I'd only gotten through the first two seasons; for those two seasons, the above still stands.

The third season is a mess. The new Ray, and the writing around the new Ray, took quite a while to find their way. Spy vs. Spy is good, largely due to Martha Burns as a Russian terrorist - she's really a treat to watch. After that, the shows are okay but not great, until you get to the last disk. For the last few shows, Ray 2 is in his element, and the shows are a lot better.

Call of the Wild is a treat. Not going to say any more about it except that Leslie Nielsen is back, and he steals every scene he's in (that's a good thing). These two shows almost make it worth having slogged through the rest of season 3.

A couple minor quibbles with the production: I'm in Chicago, but I'm familiar with Toronto. They shot enough B roll of Chicago to do a passable job of making it look like Chicago. That is, it looked vaguely like Chicago until a car would go flying down a street, and I'd notice that the parked cars had Ontario plates. Or a shopping center sign spelled ""centre"" - something you don't see much around here. Then there was the gas station sign where the price was obviously a per-liter price, as gas here hasn't been 51 cents since the mid-70s. Or a recognizable Toronto landmark showing up as, say, the Cook County courthouse. Or the subway that's a lot nicer looking than the genuine article.  If things like this bother you, they will drive you insane here. At least the mailboxes were blue.

On average, if I could give half a star, I'd give this 3 and a half stars. I suppose the less-good shows would have been good enough, but the really good shows are SO good, it makes the more average shows look pretty bad. The series as a whole is worth watching, but I very nearly lost patience with some of it. If you quit after season 2, I'll understand, but you'll miss Call of the Wild, so please watch the whole thing.",1373241600,3,3180,4.25

3232887,3,B000X4WKG0,"The show itself is one of my favorite shows of the 90s. Due South has some fantastic characters, great comedy, and it has some good action as well. They absolutely love to have fun with Canadian and American stereotypes (especially how polite Canadians are), have plenty of fun with sticking a Mountie out of his element in the middle of Chicago, and this show is just plain good family fun. It's a real shame that they didn't make more of it.

As for this particular release, I'd advise against picking it up unless you just want the show cheap and don't care about video quality. The video has been way, _way_ over-compressed. They have too many episodes per disc, and the result is that the video is highly pixelated. It's the worst quality that I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. On the bright side, it's cheap, so if you don't want to pay much, then you can get the whole series for cheap, but you get what you pay for.

If you really want this show at decent quality, I would advise picking up the Canadian releases of the show. It comes in 4 parts and unfortunately costs at least 4 times as much, but you actually get good quality with that release. You can pick them up at amazon (the full set can currently be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-South-4-pack-Season-1-2-3-PlusThe-Final-Season/dp/B000BVMVQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due South (4 pack) Season 1,2,3 PlusThe Final Season</a>), or you might be able to find them at amazon.ca for somewhat cheaper depending on what the exact pricing looks like when you read this. But I seriously regret having picked up this release, and as soon as I figured out what was going on, I picked up the Canadian one, and I don't regret it one bit.

Paul Gross plays Benton in such a natural way and never once abandons his character.  He's as crisp and clean in the last episode as he was in the first.

3232921,5,B000X4WKG0,"This show was a twist on the ""buddy cop"" movies/tv series.  It was initially meant to be just a two-part made for TV movie, but it did well enough that it was turned into a series.  Chances are anyone who is reading this already knows the story, so I will not rehash that too much.  They did very well with the ""fish out of water"" story.  The show blended elements of comedy, drama and action perfectly.

The key to the show was that it was always well acted.  Even in the last season after David Marciano left and the story became a little more campy, the acting was always great.  One thing I had forgotten was how many guest appearances were made on the show.  Leslie Nielsen was the big one, who appeared in a few different episodes.  But Ryan Phillipe and Mark Ruffalo also guest starred in very early roles for both of them.

I originally thought that the show should have gone on longer, but after watching the series again from beginning to end, I think that the show went out at exactly the right time.  It told as many stories as possible, without getting extremely repetitive.  It was definitely a show that was always being kept alive.  It barely got a second season on CBS, then survived a couple more in syndication.

In the end I felt it did a fine job wrapping up everyone's stories, and leaving the ""continued adventures"" to the imagination.  It was one of the best series on the air at the time.  It did not rely on gratuitous sex and violence to be entertaining.  The stories always had a point, and the acting was great.

But Echo Bridge has slaughtered it by SERIOUSLY overcompressing the video. I bought this set thinking it was surprisingly cheap, and then understood why. Echo Bridge has compressed the episodes to such an extent that pixelation appears in every intense action scene for the first couple of seasons and pixelation almost obliterates the images for any scene with motion in seasons three and four. It's a travesty! And it's not because the show's old. I have DVDs of TV shows from the eighties that look FAR better. And Alliance Atlantis, the people releasing the Canadian version of Due South, did NOT overcompress the video so there is NO pixelation for any of the episodes, regardless of season.

3232937,4,B000X4WKG0,"Due South is a good clean fun, I enjoy it.  Imagine Dudley Do-Right and Snidley Whiplash as two very different cops teamed up to fight crime in Chicago.

Episodes are over 40 minutes long, it was an hour long show and now the commercials have been deleted.  Sixty eight episodes are included in the set, the back cover says 52 hours of playing time.  Six and ocasionally seven episodes are crammed onto each of eleven disks so the video quality is OK but not great.  Keep in mind that in the 80's most shows were broadcast from video tape instead of film so the video quality on the disks is similar to what you would have seen on TV when the show was first broadcast.

For me the good stories make Due South worth watching.  The video and audio quality is still good with a progressive scan DVD player connected to my 32 inch HDTV, it does not interfere with watching the show.  I still prefer to enjoy watching a good story, even if it's in black and white, over a poor story with a lot of spectacular special effects.

It would be nice if the case was better, but I always put these sets with oversized cases in 6 disc silm cases.

The only thing I do wish this collection had is a Play All feature.  At least they don't have three or four screens of warnings and disclaimers that you can't skip or fast forward through.  Those take too long and is anyone really going to read them anyway? Those screens are just annoying.

3232944,4,B000X4WKG0,"A friend of mine has the ""Ultimate"" US release featured on this page. I collected the original Canadian sets as they were released. Seen both. I wrote the following as Amazon commentary on the US releases of individual seasons. Still stand by it.

True, the US sets are cheaper than the Canada sets (though if you buy the Canada sets from Amazon.ca, they're LOTS cheaper than buying them as imports from Amazon.com). True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.

However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations). And finally --

-- small thing though it may be --

-- the Canadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.

I won't tell you not to save the dough on the American release, I empathize ... I'll only tell you, the Canadian sets have more vibrant sound and video. And in the end, it's what's ON the DVD that matters the most ... isn't it?",1285372800,64,2338,4.624096385542169

The set is of good quality despite the mastering/compression used.  The content is the majority of the cost of the set, anyway.  I have seen other more popular movies/series that are of less quality overall than what people have complained about this one.  There are more factors at play than simply the compression used to master the disc.  The type of player you use as well as the TV it is viewed on will affect the overall ""viewing"" quality as well.  I use a $20 DVD player connect to an HD TV via RCA connections.  I have not experienced only a slight bit of pixelation when viewing a couple of episodes and only one or two glitches in overall playback.  I am simply happy to have found an enjoyable program that is still available.  I am sure that a super high quality edition could be produced and distributed on a 4 episode per disc format.  This would simply translate into a 17 disc set, most likely in a 2 or 3 case format and be likely to cost 2 to 3 times more than the currently available option.  The set is well put together and priced right.  If you have ever watched any of the episodes or all of them on TV and enjoyed the series then this is a good buy for you.

I had watched 'Due South' some months ago after reading what a great show it was. After renting it, i HAD to have it!
This is the best and most affordable box set there is!
Yes it is the COMPLETE series. There are those that are confused, seeing as on tv there were 4 seasons, but not to worry. They just combined season 4 with season's 3; so really, you do get ALL the episodes.
There are no special features to this, just the episodes, and sometimes you may see the image pixel slightly, but only if you're looking for it. It's hardly noticeable, otherwise the picture and quality are great. (the only reason i looked for it, was because i had read a previous reviewer mention it. i had wanted to see if it was true) Not bad for such an affordable price.
There is one episode that might drive you crazy though. It's the one called 'Eclipse' on season 3. It's so dark, that at times you don't see the actors; but that has nothing to do with the quality of the disk. That's all to the show's crew bad lighting skills; and only during which they are in a building. Once outside, it's perfect. Thought i'd get a heads up for that episode, in defense for the rest of the set.
The 'Call of the Wild' episodes (the last 2 for the series finale) has been made into a sepriate movie disk. Please don't buy that if you brought the box set. It's the SAME EXACT EPISODES! I've read other reveiwers say this time and time again, but 'duh-duh' me didn't believe them, thinking there might be more to the disk that the set didn't provide. It doesn't. Leave it be people, leave it be!

Diefenbaker, of course, is not really a wolf but plays one on the show.

When I finally gave in, the price was so great here at Amazon I could not pass it up. On sale, the complete series was the same price as the purchase of a single season.  Who could pass that up?

Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The videos came in a really nice book like case each with its own page.  All are will marked and stay where you put them.

The quality of the video and sound is no worse or different than when it originally aired on TV. I have watched the videos on a 19"" Flat screen LCD / traditional 32"" TV and a 32"" flat screen LCD TV and have yet to see any issues with picture or sound quality.

2. Yes, the picture quality isn't as great as, say, the Homicide: LOTS DVDs that are out there, but it isn't a ripoff. I watched these on a big widescreen HD TV and the video looked fine, great even; there were one or two points where, yeah, there was a little video interference, but it never interrupted the show, and again--it's a great show, and this is a great price. The video on my TV was, to be honest, much better quality than I expected.

Now, as a side note, playing on a portable DVD player? The image got a little pixelated on and off, but I think that's just that player and the way it reads discs.

This set is totally worth it; or at least, it was to me. I can't not smile when watching this show.

3. I was a little confused when I bought this, since to my knowledge there had been four seasons. This set IS all four of the seasons, there's just odd labeling.

Also -- up above, you might see this set being offered with the ""Call of the Wild"" set? Yeah, don't click that. This set has the Call of the Wild episodes on it. So. Yeah.

Aside from the crappy menu, they also have the first Vecchio on the disks containing the third season (when Kowalski was undercover as Vecchio and Vecchio was barely even there).
Now there's also the matter of the amount of episodes per disk. For this you have to consider two things. One I paid 20 dollars for Four seasons. Two this show was produced in 1994 to 1996 for the first two seasons, and 1996 to 1999 for the last two. If you've watched reruns of old 90's shows (like the first couple seasons of X-files 1993...) then you know the quality's not great. So the first couple seasons of Due South aren't that great either, though the last two seasons are better. The haven't been enhanced, but they also only cost 20 dollars so... you get what you pay for. If you really want to hold out in case they decided to release an enhanced version you can do that. Or if you're able to buy the Canadian version (which I've heard is better) then do that. BTW the USA release of Due South has 4 seasons, the Canadian 3 (but it's the same episodes, only the third season was split in two for some reason.) Oh and don't buy Call of the Wild because it's included. In the end you get 4(USA)/3(CA) seasons, and the follow up movie. It's not enhanced, and the quality of film shows it's age. But it's only 20 dollars and how many people have bought a new movie for 20 only to hate it, or end up watch it few times before leaving it to gather dust on a shelf somewhere. At least most people buying this series already like it. In the end, I read up on the product, knew basicly what I was getting, found a price I was willing to pay from seller with a 95% or higher rating and was content with what I got even if I did exerience an urge to smack the person or persons that thought Peach was a good font color. Oh, and ratio of the film is weird, it a square in the middle with black on either side. I guess I should be glad it's not peach on either side. Seriously people, I will redesign the menu for free if you let me.",1255996800,4,2275,4.1376975169300225

3232972,5,B000X4WKG0,"Due South was great show that was severly underrated. I loved this show when it was on and was able to re-discover that love through Netflix. When I spotted the collection on Amazon I knew I had to have it. Paul Gross' portrayal of Constable Benton Fraser of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was charming, funny, whimsical, sexy & nieve at the same time. The humor of the show was classic and still makes me giggle. Although Constable Fraser first came to Chicago on the trail of his father's killers, he was able to stay on our tvs for 3 seasons.  I know that Due South will stay in my heart forever.  I will always see that Canadian Red Mounty uniform and picture Fraser standing there with the loveable Defenbaker at his side.  I highly recommend this box set for any true Due South fan.

3232985,4,B000X4WKG0,"For some reason or other--pig-headedness, probably, or a warts and all desire not to run with the crowd--I'm usually about a decade behind on TV series.  I'm usually not a fan of the big hits.

I'm finally watching ""Due South"" courtesy of Netflix. It revolves around the adventures of a police odd couple, a Mountie (descended about equally from Dudley-Do-Right and Sgt. Preston) and a cynical, not-so-very-by-the-book Chicago Detective.  The Mountie, Constable Benton Frazer, has a ""pet"" wolf. It sleeps in his bed, while Frazier sleeps in a pristine boy scout bed-roll, on the floor.

I have to admit, I've just completed viewing the first year. At first, DS had me genre-confused, then I realized it's cheerfully playing the field. In the beginning, it seemed to be old time T.V. with a happy-ending, clearly never meant to be taken too seriously, targeting the ""Murder She Wrote"" demographic + Canadian jokes. Some episodes were just plain witty, and with a wry, dry, off-kilter Pythonlike humor. Others, with street kids and dogs, were sort of corny, with plots which strained even this old lady's credulity. Nevertheless, the opening shot of Constable Frazier marching into Chicago-- with his boots, backpack and animal companion wolf--is poignant. He's the classic Stranger in a Strange Land, an (only slightly saner) Don Quixote RCMP.

I'm getting soft in my old age, but it's uplifting to enter--if only through the suspension of belief required by theater--a reality where honesty, knowledge, industry, creative thinking and optimism carry the day. I've grown to LOVE these characters, especially, (and just like all the women who populate this series) I love the Constable! This guy needs lots and lots of cookies--and a good woman to take care of him.

And just as I'm thinking that, Blam! The ""Victoria's Secret"" episodes! Suddenly, it's all romantic tragedy, with bare skin on Hudson Bay Blankets, and an old flame almost getting the Constable killed. I was floored by the change, but definitely will continue watching.

Due South is highly character driven, and the plots sometimes suffer, particularly as the '90's are getting to be ancient history, but I've got a weakness for charming off-beat characters. ""Due South"" has plenty, as well as the wolf sidekick, who is by turns trusty police dog and/or obnoxious roommate. There are ghosts, too, more often than ""Hamlet.""

BTW, wonder if the video quality earlier reviews have mentioned result from some scenes (apparently) being shot in video tape instead of film. Sometimes the cutting together of these very different textures and photographic capability give the viewer an unpleasant jolt. However, I'm no expert, so could be wrong about this being the reason for ""poor quality"" others have spoken of.

Anyway--I really am enjoying this series!  A LOT of bang for the buck here.",1232409600,,2848,5.1317494600431965
3232986,5,B000X4WKG0,"I read the reviews on this site before I purchased this and really did not find them very informative, mainly because all I really wanted to know was if all the seasons were actually combined together for such a low price - it was on sale for about $20.  And the answer is YES!  All the seasons are in the one set.  There's about 6 episodes on each disc, which is fine.  One review I read was complaining about the quality and I honestly haven't had a problem with it all; however, I'm not particular in that area either.  Everything so far appears to be clear and I haven't had a problem watching the episodes.

I had heard that this was an enjoyable series, but since it is a Canadian show which I had never seen any of (and I live in the US), I was a bit leery about buying without having seen some episodes at least, but I couldn't pass it up for the above price.  I've watched the pilot and a few episodes so far; therefore, I still have a long way to go, but I have been pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable the series is.  It's a bit cheesy, but the humor is alot of fun.  It's obviously a low budget series, but I wasn't expecting a bunch of neat special effects and that's not what I wanted. The series appears to be well written and enjoyable and that is definitely good enough for me.

Paul Haggis is the creator and the writer for the first two seasons.  I think the clever writing is what makes the show so timeless.

Due South was the first time I heard Canadian singer, Sarah McClanchlan's voice in the background on the 3 episodes about Fraser's one love, Victoria...  Fantastic!  Due South uses many Canadian actors and singers.

My girls are young teenagers and they love watching the DVDs as much as I do.  In fact, we got a puppy in October and named him Fraser... he has a red collar like a Canadian Mountie!

I've really enjoyed all four seasons!  I would highly recommend it.  However, the quality of the DVDs is not perfect.  I had three episodes that ""locked up"" on me while watching the DVDs.  I contacted Amazon and they were amazing to work with.  In the end, I received another DVD set, and still had problems viewing but it was with different DVD.

I want to echo what others have said here. Yes, the price for the complete collection is right but with the price comes poor packaging (I have received two of the complete collections--a set and a replacement for the damaged set--and in both the first disc in set came off the spindle), scratched DVDs (in the two sets about 1/4 of the discs were scratched and looked used), poor picture quality (too many episodes squeezed on to too few discs still it could be far worse), video stops and starts, audio dropouts, and horizontal lines in the picture frame at one point.

If you like this series as I do and you have an all-region DVD player and the money go for the Network box set from the UK. The picture quality is far superior and so is the packaging. I have also heard excellent things about the French TF1 releases that have come out thus far.

3232998,1,B000X4WKG0,"DUE SOUTH: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION has got to be the worst quality commercial DVD I've ever seen.  I was really looking forward to watching this series for the first time.  68 episodes for $30 didn't seem suspicious since I figured it's a little-known show that probably underperformed for the DVD studio in season sets, so they decided to burn off their investment in one affordable mega-set.  When I saw the first disc my blood ran ice cold:  6 TV hours on one DVD?  Okay, most TV sets won't break a 4-episode per disc limit or risk some serious image compression issues.  Fancy sets will do 2 or 3 per disc which in my opinion generates a reference quality picture.  I thumbed through the rest of the discs and would have laughed had I not broke the manufacturer's shrinkwrap, thereby making a refund impossible:  Some discs in this set contain a whopping 7 episodes!!!  I skimmed through some of the episodes on disc 1:  Despite the fact that this is an older show (pre-HD), and the image is naturally soft, there is expectedly HEAVY PIXELATION.  Whenever someone or something moves, they turn into a blob of compression.  Cars, people... in this shameful presentation, the show can't even fade out or in from black without turning into a videophile's nightmare.  Cursing, I inserted a disc with 7 episodes -- morbid curiosity at this point.  The cast can't even walk down a hall without the picture turning into a substandard digital cable parody.  I suppose the math of the issue should have occurred to me: 68 episodes divided by 11 discs = VCD quality.  Too late.  So tell me, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment: What's the point of putting a show on DVD if it would look better on VHS?  Thanks for disrespecting what I understand is a truly great show, and thanks for ripping me off.  Have a nice day.",1221264000,130,1806,4.640378548895899
3232999,5,B000X4WKG0,"For those of you who haven't seen a single episode of Due South and need some clues as to what kind of show this is, I'll give it a shot.  I wouldn't be surprised if this show was cancelled simply because it doesn't fit neatly into a particular category and would be hard to pitch to execs.

My teenaged kids' favorite character is Diefenbaker, the beautiful dog you see on the cover.  He's deaf, supposedly can read lips, and has engaging storylines that center around him.  Working with animals in a production is extremely difficult to do.  I'm impressed by Diefenbaker and always look forward to his presence in the show.  He's described as wolf that decided to live with Fraser (the mountie) and went deaf when he saved Fraser's life in a water rescue.  This is a comedy and I find it easy to set aside any quibbles with the chances of this happening, although it's my understanding that sometimes people who own sled dogs and live in the far north have wolves interact with their dogs and even become somewhat friendly toward the people if they're fed.  Diefenbaker is a big step up from the dog heroes I enjoyed as a child.  He is very much as fully realized a character as any of the other leads.

My favorite character is Fraser.  I've always had a fondness for the innocent, brave and ultra-polite stereotypical image of 'Mounties' and Fraser doesn't disappoint with his sometimes comical adherence to the strict letter of the law and his rarely fallible capability to track down bad guys in any terrain.  I believe his mother was a librarian if I remember correctly, or maybe it was a grandparent.  This is the excuse the writers use to turn Fraser into a kind of living encyclopedia.  The pilot says it all as Fraser brings in the bad guy in a bad storm by sled for illegal fishing.  You have to see the show to get the punchline, and how he ends up in Chicago is a fun set up.

Vecchio, Fraser's Chicago partner, is the jaded cop on the verge of being a screw-up that offsets Fraser's straight role.  He loves his car too much, loves his clothes too much and doesn't do much to fight crime until Fraser comes along.  At his heart Vecchio wants to do well but clearly hasn't an idea of how to go about it.  He's too much of an adult to have Fraser become his role model, but by their interactions and Vecchio's increasing success in crime fighting he quickly develops into a force to be reckoned with.  He's not exactly comic relief.  His role is more complex than that.  Every character, including Vecchio's sister, is comical and exaggerated in some way, but they also have a heart that we all aspire to find within ourselves that's unbreakable and untaintable.  The writers play with this idea a great deal, tempting these iconic characters to sully themselves, but they don't, and it's a beautiful thing.

Fun secondary characters abound, including the ghosts of the fathers of Fraser and Vecchio.  The writers rarely miss an opportunity to make a side character make us want to laugh even as the viewer becomes engaged in the crime-solving storyline.  The crimes aren't particularly campy, nor is the crime-solving.  It's more of a dry comedy with some serious moments.  It is extremely family friendly with very limited violence, although some very young children may be concerned or disturbed about animals in danger, especially the horses/slaughterhouse episode where there are hanging carcasses and they may correctly interpret that those are meant to depict horse carcasses.

I have no complaints about the quality of the DVDs themselves.  The case is solid and holds the DVDs well.  There weren't any loose on arrival.",1220832000,4,3641,4.686614173228347
