7989960,4,B000096I8N,"With theme music reminiscent of something written by the Partridge Family, Thick as Thieves is a light, enjoyable, little-known britcom from the early 1970s. Bob Hoskins stars as George Dobbs (""Dobbsy"" as he's known to his mates), a thief who, as the series opens, has just been released from prison--only to find out that his wife, in the interim, has fallen in love and shacked up with his best friend and partner in crime, Stan (played by the late John Thaw (Inspector Morse--who would've been in his early thirties here and who sadly died of throat cancer in 2002)).

Problems arise when George returns home only to find that his wife, Annie, has no intention of giving the elbow to Stan, who's been a real handyman during George's absence, doing a lot of repairs and odd jobs that would never have gotten done otherwise; actually, one gets the feeling they wouldn't have gotten done even if George hadn't been in prison! As one can imagine, jealousy rears its head frequently as Stan and George each want to be Annie's number one, and the situations that arise are often of the ""three's a crowd"" variety.

The dvd set contains the entire series, which consists of eight 25-minute episodes. The series, which is serial in nature, was written by veteran comedy writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (Porridge, Auf Wiedersehen Pet; La Frenais (sans Clement) was the screenwriter for the Lovejoy series). If you are familiar with and have enjoyed Clement and La Frenais' other works (particularly Porridge, which is the only other half-hour britcom mentioned and which is the most similar in style and tone to this one), then you may wish to give this one a try.  Some episodes are better than others, of course, but all in all it's well-acted and features a strong (though small) cast.

Recommended to fans of British comedy--particularly to those who enjoy the older comedies and who are looking for something they've not seen before.",1151971200,4,1939,4.831325301204819
7989961,4,B000096I8N,"I have an encyclopedia of British television series and notice all the Britcoms that look promising but have never been shown over here to my knowledge. Well, would you believe there is one in which a young Bob Hoskins (""Roger Rabbit"") and  a not yet white haired John Thaw (""Inspector Morse"") play a pair of very inept thieves? There are only eight episodes, mainly because Thaw had other commitments, but what there is ranges from downright silly to genuinely funny and all eight are now available on two DVDs or 3 VHSs, courtesy of Acorn Media.
 The basic situation of ""Thick as Thieves"" is that getting out prison a day early, George (Hoskins) returns home to find that his best friend Stan (Thaw) has taken up permanent residence with George's wife Annie (Pat Ashton). A good deal of the plots revolve around the attempts of the three to come to terms with the situation as the wife is the only wage-earner to keep them going. The denouement in the last episode might be predictable (how else to solve the problem?) but the means to it is truly imaginative.
 Thaw and Hoskins play off one another nicely and make a great comic team. We over here might have some trouble following the East End accents, but the lingo is priceless and a guest appearance by Trevor Peacock (the dithering old man in ""The Vicar of Dibley"") is an unexpected bonus. Though not exactly as subtle as ""Mapp and Lucia"" or as sledgehammer as ""Fawlty Towers,"" ""Thick as Thieves"" will amuse you nevertheless.",1051920000,10,1483,4.674329501915709
