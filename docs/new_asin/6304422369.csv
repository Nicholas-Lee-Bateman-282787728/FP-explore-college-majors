7871277,4,6304422369,"This film would be enjoyable by the entire family, although probably aimed at older children. After the head of a large computer company dies, his brother has his brother's young son kidnapped so he can take over the company. To avoid a takeover, others in the company find a boy who looks like the missing heir. They make a deal with the fake heir: he will pretend to be the real heir temporarily, in return for a job for his unemployed father. There is one big problem: The real heir is a computer whiz and knows little about sports. The fake heir knows nothing about computers, but is a real whiz at baseball. It's interesting watching the real heir try to escape, while the fake heir struggles to play his part. Will the heir escape? Will his uncle get what's coming to him? Will the two boys finally meet? Although this movie is fairly predictable, it's fun to go along for the ride!",1357516800,,888,4.45398773006135
