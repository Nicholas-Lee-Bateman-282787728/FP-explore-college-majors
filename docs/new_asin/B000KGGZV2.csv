2690910,5,B000KGGZV2,"PAUL MOONEY SHOULD TEACH A HISTORY CLASS AT SOME MAJOR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA BECAUSE I GOT EDUCATIONED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD IN ABOUT 90 MINUTES.  HE GIVES YOU KNOWLEDGE AND MAKES YOU LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME.  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ABOUT YOURSELF OR ANY OTHER RACE, PLEASE BUY THIS DVD ASAP.",1172016000,3,329,4.290322580645161
2690911,5,B000KGGZV2,"I am very offended that the producers felt I was too stupid to appreciate Mr. Mooney's comedy act on it's own, instead feeling the need to stop his act, and insert interview clips of Sandra Bernhard explaining his jokes. If you truly either 'get it or you dont', as she says, then why do you need to have his act interrupted by an interview with her for 15 seconds while she explains the jokes to you?

The most egregious example is during his joke about the holocaust and lottery numbers. Yeah, that joke would offend a lot of people. On the other hand I once knew a Jewish Israeli guy who told me a lot worse jokes than that. So why does Sandra have to explain it? Do you think 50 year old grandma's are renting this DVD in Sheboygan and will suddenly go 'oh, ok, ha ha, now i can laugh!' after Sandra gives the OK? If the producers felt this material was wrong, why did they make the DVD? If they want to explore the nature of offensiveness in comedy, put it in a separate debate section at the end. But please, not in the middle!

Other than that, this DVD was great. It had me laughing really, really hard. He is definitely unique and undergroundish. Not the Comedy Central type of underground .... I mean he makes fun of power and the powerful. It will hit you in the gut the way the best comedy does, laughing so that your face muscles hurt and you can't hardly make a sound. He is a true professional.",1172016000,6,1409,4.253731343283582
2690912,5,B000KGGZV2,"I enjoyed the entire show and have seen him live in Washington DC, Lincoln Theater. I like the way he uses comedy to spoon feed people with the Truth. The fact that he wrote for Richard Pryor is a testament to his comical genius.",1171324800,5,229,4.2272727272727275

2690920,5,B000KGGZV2,Mr Mooney continues to make people laugh with his unique brand of humor!!! He makes racism funny and makes us all laugh at ourselves.  This is the key to humor being able to laugh at ourselves and laugh with the comedian himself.  So many comedians laugh at people in a mean way that I get turned off.  Mr. Mooney allows us to see the humor in racism so we are not stigmatized in any way.,1388016000,,388,4.1466666666666665

2690926,1,B000KGGZV2,"I find Paul Mooney funny and downright amusing,He made me laugh A lot on Dave Chappelle but his jokes get old and he uses the same jokes, I love his attacks on the cult of Ron L Hubbard and Aliens and his making fun of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans,Dominicans. The only problem is his Revisionist history from an angry person who happens to be funny and even talented(There is no denying that)sad way to use your talent.",1303862400,2,417,4.428571428571429

2690932,5,B000KGGZV2,"Paul Mooney is amazing! I knew he wrote for Richard Pryor and I had seen segments of him on Chappelles Show, he's hilarious. And for people that think he's racist they really need to grow up and really listen to what he's saying. Paul is all about unity but expresses it through his own brand of humor. In this dvd he pokes fun at the native americans, im native american and I thought it was brilliant! So come on people, have a sense of humor!",1231632000,,445,4.247058823529412

2690934,3,B000KGGZV2,"I really liked this special. Paul Mooney is hysterical. His delivery is perfection and his stage presence is masterful. He commands the audience like NO OTHER! Very, Very, Very funny stuff.

  I did however feel that Paul came off as somewhat bigoted towards white people as a previous reviewer noted. I am a very liberal person and I am ALL for knowing your history as an individual and ethnic group, but I felt like Paul (at times) seemed almost TOO rooted in the anti-white sentiment for me to fully root for him.

  Don't get me wrong, I cracked up. In fact, I had tears running down my face at moments. So, as a stand-up routine he earns the high marks. I just disagree with his views that ALL white people are racist and was even insulted by Sandra Bernhard reitterating that ideology in her little cut-to interview segment.

Paul's comments about bringing America back to Jesus Christ were a little hypocritical seeing as his language choice isn't very Christian in verbage. For a so-called Christian to get on a stage and spout profanity and attitudes that are hateful and bigoted is very wrong-at least in my opinion as a Christian individual. Also, how do you stand up on a stage and tell people to find faith with Christ and then the next second tell people that DNA has proven that humanity can be traced back to one African American woman over 10,000 years ago? Isn't that kind of against the whole Adam and Eve theory?  If you are going to walk the walk, you have to TALK THE TALK in that sense. THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH! :)

my overall opinion of his comedy is very high. I loved it. It was hilarious. But, I do think Paul should wander into new territory as a comedian and not dwell on bashing us Caucasion folks. I know white America has some nut-jobs, but every race does. Trust me,  We aren't all bad!! I think that dwelling on negativity only creates more negativity and I feel like that is the end-product of his words. We need to move on as a nation and be unified, not segregate ourselves more than we were in the past.

Bottom Line: LOVE PAUL'S COMEDY; Dislike the reverse racism.",1215734400,6,2109,4.494764397905759
2690935,5,B000KGGZV2,"Paul Mooney is in session. Leave your misconceptions at the door. Come on in and get ready to be educated. You may not hear what you're used to hearing but you will be hearing the truth. Funny, laugh out loud truth. Is it comedy? What is comedy? Will it make you laugh? Yes. Will it make you uncomforable? Maybe. Should it be missed? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Class is in session.",1213056000,,370,4.3768115942028984
2690936,5,B000KGGZV2,I really enjoyed this.  Paul Mooney had sone a good job with analyzing America(as always) and made it funny.  I had tears running down my cheecks it was so funny.  I hope to buy his other works too.,1210723200,,198,4.157894736842105
2690937,5,B000KGGZV2,paul mooney paul mooney paul mooney by far my favorite comedian grab the popcorn and pay attenion cause the funniest jokes are the ones you have to think about,1209772800,,159,4.517241379310345
2690938,5,B000KGGZV2,"I have purchased this DVD for at least 3 friends since I bought my own.  The production is suspect but the rest is pure Mooney insight, delirium, keep-it-real-leave-if-you-don't-like-it(and a few did), laugh until you need emergency oxygen humor!  Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from cryin' and Mooney will have you doing both.  Highly recommended.",1206230400,,353,5.267857142857143
2690939,5,B000KGGZV2,"Paul Mooney in this classic is funny as hell in an intellignet way, some people would get tired of him talking about race matters but in this world and time we can't forget that everything is race related! Very entertaining as he examine stereotypes and says the things that you want to say but don't have the guts to. I love Paul Mooney and you will too just view it with an open mind!",1201132800,,386,4.22972972972973
2690940,5,B000KGGZV2,"Bravo, Bravo, Encore! Paul Mooney is the greatest of all times, he is funny, witty and hilarious all rolled up in one. Controversial but who isn't, the only difference from him and other comics is they sugar coat their view/comedy but he holds no punches.  So what if he offends people, he is speaking the truth so if you are offended by his words then maybe you need to change because he is probably speaking about people like you.  If you want to laugh and get the raw reality of life in a humorous but serious way, you should get this DVD, it was great! Loved it.",1195776000,,566,4.280373831775701
2690941,3,B000KGGZV2,"I was a bit disappointed for the fact that Mooney reused a lot of the same jokes from his ""Analyzing White America"" stand up. I was hoping for a bit more originality from Paul Mooney but aside from that it still had me rolling and I respect the fact that he tells it like it is. No matter who walks out on him ha ha ha!!",1185148800,,320,3.8636363636363638
2690942,2,B000KGGZV2,"Hmmm....ok, where do i start?  Let's start with the good. I think Paul Mooney can often times be very, very funny. I used to work at a comedy club, and have seen him perform at least 50 times live.  While i didn't watch his whole set every time, i watched quite a bit.  Even the jokes i'd heard over and over usually don't get old.  He's clever, has a genuinely good sense of timing, stage presence, and joke-writing ability.  Personally, he was also a very sweet guy.  Some others i worked with didn't care for him, but i always found him pleasant.  We used to sit and chat after the shows on occasion.

Ok, so after all that, why am i giving the review only 2 stars?  Well, there are a couple reasons.

1. The presentation of the DVD is HORRIBLE.  Much like a John Denver DVD i watched (see, i told you i was white), Mooney's stand-up show is continually cut-up by having to hear commentary from other comics.  I don't NEED to be told why it's ok to be white and like Mooney.  I bought the damn thing, didn't i?  That's a huge, huge negative for me.  I want to be able to watch his whole act uncut, without having to have breaks.

2. While i find Paul very funny, and love much of his social commentary, i have to admit, he IS wrong about some things.  I don't mean opinion-related things.  That's subjective, of course.  But he sometimes gets clearly verifiable facts wrong (such as black Jesus & Cleopatra).  Sometimes they are 100% blatant mis-truths, and sometimes they are distorted concepts taken out-of-context.  Again, this is not his whole show.  He certainly DOES point out truths that never get pointed out by the media or history books....but NOT because the media or history books LIE, but because they often omit them.

Anyhow, i still like Mooney, and enjoy his CD's Race and Masterpiece (even though the audio quality on both is HORRID...man, he really needs a new album).  I just think that listening to his material has to be tempered with the knowledge that on occasion, he's either mistaken or distorting facts. I would have given this DVD 4 stars (knocking one off for his mis-info), but i had to knock a whole 2 stars off for the terrible layout of the DVD itself.",1184198400,9,2188,4.4534005037783375
2690943,5,B000KGGZV2,"This is Hillarious!!!! Paul Mooney is in his classic form and definitely doesnt dissapoint in this funny film!!

And yes Jesus was of Black African descent and so was Cleopatra. Even if she was mixed, she was definitely of DIRECT Black African descent.

2690944,5,B000KGGZV2,Paul Mooney is the best.  Know your History is nothing short of amazing!  He talks about racial issues and is dead on.,1177372800,6,118,4.318181818181818
2690945,5,B000KGGZV2,"Paul Mooney. Very funny and at the same time will tell it like it is. I enjoyed this DVD. He not only did a little stand up, but you were able to hear other comedians (Sandra Burnheard, David Allen Grier to name a few)give you their experience working with Mooney himself.

I do know this....if you are easily offended and do not want to get into religion and the politics....this DVD is not for you. He's going to speak his mind and whether you agree w/ what he's saying or not, you have to admit a lot of it makes sense in the logical world.

Don't take my word for it, but this was a good buy (hella cheap for the goodness on this DVD) and watch it with an open mind and TALK after the DVD is over. That's the goal to getting every one together....communication.",1176422400,3,765,4.197278911564626
2690946,5,B000KGGZV2,"Here, one of this countries greatest unsung comedian/writer/socially and politically conscious commentators,  shows us the vast perspective that is uniquely Paul Mooney. Bold, unapologetic,wickedly humorous and intellegently delivered, this is the definitive Mooney which shows the comedic genious at his candid best. Don't be alarmed, this is not simple militantcy, but brazen,  in your face, un-compromising honesty and humor! Whether you agree with the views of Paul Mooney or not, this particular dvd showcases the pioneering talent that is typical of today's black comic,un-flinching and harsh, but oh so funny as hell. Make no mistake about it, this is not your grandfather's comedy....and Paul Mooney along with his friend Richard Pryor,  helped to open the very doors that made this possible.

2690950,4,B000KGGZV2,"Being a fan of Paul Mooney, you know what you are going to get.  His humor is always insightful, and often times uncomfortable.  Those two things make this dvd enjoyable and thought provoking.  He always leaves me wanting more at his conclusions, and this dvd is no different.",1173398400,6,276,4.708333333333333
2690951,5,B000KGGZV2,"He does it again with his standup--a must buy for blacks and whites, and any other race who wants to know the truth in an in your face way.

2690952,2,B000KGGZV2,"Jesus was ethnically Middle-Eastern, Cleopatra was of Macedonian/Greek decent, so no, neither of them were black, but if you are as self-righteous and big-headed as Mooney is, this DVD will at least make you feel very smug.",1173052800,7,223,5.054054054054054
2690953,4,B000KGGZV2,"I am a new fan. I never heard of Paul Mooney until he started showing up on Chappeles' Show, and Howard Stern. I immediately became a fan. Edgy and loaded with great observations about race in America, this DVD hits the mark. I am white and am no way offended by what he says. I think there are severe differences with color and enjoy someone that does not hide behind the PC police to cover that up.

If I have one complaint it's the fact that the stand up routine is often times interrupted with other comics telling us, the viewer, what a genius Paul Mooney is. I don't know why they would produce it like that. I would rather just have the routine uncut. I could care less what Sandra Bernhard has to say about him.

Mooney has a great way to tell stories that are funny, but make you think. I like the fact that it's not all white people dance funny jokes. He dishes it out to his own people as well. I have always been a big fan of humor that is also topical and means something, I have been a Carlin fan for years and I like Lewis Black. Discovering Paul Mooney has made me enjoy Stand-Up Comedy again.",1172102400,21,1109,4.177570093457944
