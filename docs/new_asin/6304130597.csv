Over 2000 musicians (yes,two thousand) on the field blasting away with cannons and horses and unbelievable fireworks combine for the ultimate party VHS!! As I understand it this performance in 1980 is the last time anything this large was staged in Britain due to budget constraints. Most of Britain's best bands plus some from out of country perform. Watch the many bands, and I mean many, march out onto the field one by one to combine with the others in perfect formation to the march Voice of the Guns. This has to seen to be believed. Even march haters will appreciate this!!",1120608000,,723,4.746031746031746
