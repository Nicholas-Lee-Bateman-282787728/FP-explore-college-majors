But that's what makes the videos so great. She shows the  equipment up close and explains what will happen. Just keep watching until  you get it.
She gives you hints on certain key points for the exam -  what Cisco is looking for as the right answer. I've bought other video  series with Heather Osterloh (Netware 4.11 and TCP/IP) and have never been  disappointed. Once I saw her name on the video series, I new it was a  quality product. And I was right. She is fun to watch and is thorough in  her explanation of the material. These are a great value.",952819200,,715,4.291044776119403
