8373920,4,B002MIK0U8,"This is a set of four discs, each with a different perspective on the 100 year history of the great Montreal Canadiens.  The set is in a fold-out holder, each disc in its own section and clearly labeled. Each disc can be played with either French or English narration although the actual content (interviews, videos, photos) is the same whichever you select. On all four discs some of the individual interviews are in French and some are in English, depending on who is speaking, so if you're not fluent in both, just turn on the captions from the main disc menu for either language. It was interesting to hear Bob Gainey speak in fluent French!

Each disc is set up slightly differently depending on the content. As such, each has different content for the most part, although as some reviewers have noted there is overlap across the discs too. To me, that's not a major issue as I really don't mind seeing the same goal scored in the context of a different discussion. Each disc's content has its strengths and shortcomings; I'll review each disc before giving the overall review.

Disc 1: Overview of the Centenary of the Montreal Canadiens. My copy of this disc was scratched and it froze in two places during playback. Nonetheless, despite losing some content due to the scratch, this was still an interesting and comprehensive coverage of this great hockey club. I enjoyed the interviews with diverse Canadiens and other team players, coaches, general managers, and even the trainer! The footage covered the major events and significant players well. For some reason, this disc came across as ""less professionally developed"" than the others; it had a ""cheaper"" quality to the production as compared to the others. I rate this disc 3.5/5, without penalty for the scratch (can't blame the producer for that).

Disc 2: The 24 Stanley Cup Championships. I was looking forward to this disc the most, but found I enjoyed it least of the four. That's because of how it was set up. Each Stanley Cup year was its own chapter. So as each Cup year started, a 30 second introduction would play, with music and a background montage of clips from that playoff year over a changing image of the Stanley cup and an etched name who was the key player for that year. After a while, you start to feel ""Okay, on with the show; I don't need the brief intro!"" and fast forward to the start of the series. I was also a bit disappointed that most of the cup series were only about two minutes long, and that less time was given to the great 1977 record setting cup winning team, probably the greatest NHL team ever, compared to the later victories; honestly, the former deserved a lot more coverage time, IMHO. Rating: 3/5

Disc 3: Dynasties and Rivalries. The Dynasty section includes the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s series, and all were interesting and well done. I grew up cheering the late 60s and 70s teams, so I could relate to these more than the 1950s great feats. The Rivalries section had some unique content for each rival team, and included the Quebec Nordiques, Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, and Philadelphia Flyers. Personally, I think the Chicago Blackhawks and the NY Rangers were more relevant than the Flyers, who only dominated a few years in the 1970s. I certainly agree with the inclusion of Quebec, though, as it was a huge cultural battle in Quebec at the time. 4/5

Disc 4: The Immortals. Included are: Jacques Plante, Doug Harvey, Jean Beliveau, Bernie ""Boom Boom"" Geoffrion, Howie Morenz, Maurice Richard, Guy Lafleur, Dickie Moore, Yvan Cournoyer, Henri Richard, Serge Savard, Larry Robinson, Bob Gainey, Ken Dryden, and Patrick Roy. The nature of this format means that you can choose which to watch at what time; each is a self-contained, interesting summary of these great players. I rate this section 5/5.

General remarks
Overall, I enjoyed this set. I had to return it due to the scratched disc but will buy another as I would like to have a good copy, especially of disc 1. There were only some minor issues across the discs, and one major problem on all discs. The minor issues: On discs 3 and 4, at times the sound volume was variable, getting quite low at some points then changing back when that interview was over. There was no audio formatting control on any disc. How the discs loaded was puzzlingly different: Discs 1 and 4 both started by prompting me to choose a narration language; disc 2 started with the main menu, and disc 3 started playing all episodes without going to the main menu and defaulted to the French narration. Again, not a big deal as you can always get to the main menu commands at any time.

The major problem was the very annoying visual formatting of action shots that detracted from an otherwise enjoyable experience. Someone decided to use a strange tri-split screen where the larger middle section of the screen showed the action, and the two side sections were slightly enlarged, blurred views of the edges of the images in the middle. It's hard to describe so I posted a photo I took of a one frame to illustrate. This is only true of the action series. I just don't see the purpose of presenting the material this way, especially as the side views are a bit blurred too. On one video it showed LaFleur breaking in to score the winning goal, but because of this set up, you almost missed seeing the puck going into the net, because it was cut off on the left side by that formatting. I saw this same shot on another video of that game, and it clearly shows the entire net. Although the video did shift, and you could catch the goal at the last second, why do this strange format in the first place? But aside from that annoyance, I recommend this set. For the diehard fan of ""Le club de hockey Canadien"" this set and the ""Memorable Games in Canadiens History"" 10 disc set should be in your collection.",1383177600,,5875,4.642307692307693

8373922,3,B002MIK0U8,"Received this DVD for Christmas from my son.

Great gift, especially for someone who grew up in Montreal cheering for Les Habitants.

There is some interesting history on this Centennial Edition, however the quality of the the production is significantly lacking. There are 4 individual discs yet each contains significant repetition of items. It seems that the editing was done by someone preparing a web site with hypertext links - this would make sense.

I recommend this item for nostalgia but if you really want to learn about this team and its importance to Quebec and Canada, the book that accompanies the DVD is a much better source.",1262044800,5,641,4.916666666666667
