2510872,4,B000E991IO,"I've seen many comedies with Luis De Funes and have been his fan as long as I can remember. His participation in a movie promises good time, plenty of physical comedy, funny mess of grandiose proportions and up roaring laughs. He was ""The man with the forty faces per minute"", the little volcano or small but powerful dynamo machine whose energy could supply electricity to a town of the average size , whose hilarious hyperactivity, perfect for a comic ever-changing face, and the ego of gigantic size in such miniature frame always produced a highly comic effect. All his trademarks are in full display in the updated version of the tragedy by Victor Hugo Ruy Blas, La folie des grandeurs (1971) or Delusions of Grandeur. Ruy Blaze has been adapted to the screen several times including 1948 film with Jean Mairet and 2002 version with Gerard Depardieu. Oury's film formally follows the Hugo story but with De Funes in the cast, you would not expect it to be a serious political drama, and you will be absolutely right. The film takes place in 17th century Spain and centers around a practical joke played on the queen of Spain by Don Salluste de Bazan, the rich, greedy and backstabbing tax collector for revenge. Don Salluste disguises his servant Blaze (Ives Montand) as a nobleman and takes him to the king's court. Attractive, funny, and suave, Blaze saves the king from the bomb, becomes popular, is appointed a tax collector instead of Salluste, and conquers the queen's heart. Don Salluste returns to take his revenge by notifying the king with the anonymous letter about queen's infidelity. The final act that brings together Salluste, Blaze, Salluste's nephew Don Cesar de Bazan whom his loving uncle sold as a slave to the Sahara barbarians, the furious jealous king, the queen who is in love with Blaze and her Cerberus like duea, old virgin Donna Juana (very funny Alice Sapritch) who is also passionately in love with Blaze is non-stopping laugh that left me in stitches. La folie des grandeurs, directed by Grard Oury, adapted by Oury's daughter Danile Thomson, and starring Louis de Funs (Don Salluste) and Yves Montand (Blaze) is based on the serious drama but it is so deliciously silly, dizzyingly fast, absurd, and hilarious that you would laugh even when you know how silly it is. Ives Montand replaced Bourvil who was initially meant to play Blaze, and who had a great chemistry with De Funes on the screen nicely balancing latter's super activity and aggressiveness with his gentle naivet and kindness. But as Bourvil died in 1970, Yves Montand ultimately got the role and proved to be quite good in a comedy even though the viewers were used to see him playing the cool and cynic characters in the thrillers and dramas.

As always with De Funes, he practically owns the movie. While watching ""La folie des grandeurs"" for the first time last night I could not help laughing hard and loud even knowing how silly and over the top the movie was but laughing even more because of it. This morning, I began laughing again just recalling De Funes' face and him losing his voice and making some impossible quacking and squeaking noises when caught by surprise in the most hilarious scene of the film. ""La folie des grandeurs hold the record as the most successful French film of 1971, the fact that does not surprise me at all.",1240444800,2,3345,4.767241379310345
2510873,4,B000E991IO,"We're Louis De Funes fans so when I got the chance to view this, I grabbed it. Louis De Funes plays a pompous, money obsessed Spanish ""Grandee"" (court nobleman).  In one early scene, his valet wakens him with the sound of gold ducats pouring into a bowl by his bedside.  De Funes' character smiles and signals for him to keep up with the beautiful music.  Soon he falls from grace and, in a twist of events, his valet Blaze takes his place at court.  De Funes' character plots revenge.

This is a silly comedy in which De Funes' comic genius takes center stage.  The kids all loved it and I didn't find the material objectionable.  There is a theme of infidelity, however, as the valet is in love with the queen and she agrees to a clandestine meeting. But none of the explicit sexual humor or scenees that are standard fare in today's comedies.

Our favorite De Funes movies still are Gendarme a San Tropez, Gendarme in Retirement and Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob.  But this is one is still a good evening of comedy.",1206144000,,1018,4.45945945945946
2510874,4,B000E991IO,"This is a very funny movie, (all of Louis de Funes' movies are funny) but not my favorite of his.  I say this, because I really wish more of his movies were available in English. I really wish they would release the Gendarmerie movies and the movie Jo in English.  French or German would be okay too, but God help me if I have to learn Russian just to watch my favorite comedian.",1200182400,2,379,4.178082191780822
2510875,4,B000E991IO,"Like the rest of Louis de Funes' movies, this was another pleasant way to end a long day! No sub-titles but still fun  to watch.",1179878400,,128,4.12
2510876,2,B000E991IO,"Yves Montand should not have been in this movie

as I find him so maladroit - clumsy, and really

not funny. I am sure there were better French

actor choices as supporting roles.

I enjoyed the movie somewhat, I don't think it

was worse $19.95. There are better choices.",1179532800,2,272,4.469387755102041
2510877,5,B000E991IO,Loved it! I've seen this movie many times when I was younger and it still makes me laugh. Does not get old. Great picture and sound quality too.,1178928000,4,144,4.178571428571429
2510878,5,B000E991IO,"I grew up watching all of the Louis de Funes movies. I had watched this particular one just a few years ago and although I didn't remember the entire plot, I remembered I had still liked it. I was not disappointed. I laughed from beginning to end. There are so many priceless witty lines. Some might find the story goofy but it is meant as pure entertainment. Of course much is lost through translation and the subtitles sometimes did no do justice to the original script. But my husband who is not fluent in French liked it too. Louis de Funes is such a ""physical"" actor: you just look at him and you laugh! I love this movie. It goes side by side with ""The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob"" another favorite. Very different stories but both so funny. I highly recommend this movie and I'm very happy it was finally available in NTSC format.",1174003200,10,839,4.419354838709677
2510879,2,B000E991IO,This movie is one of the least funniest Louis de Funes has made. I would not spend my money on it again,1173830400,2,103,3.727272727272727

2510881,4,B000E991IO,"The main reason I bought this DVD is Louis De Funes. He's always funny and refreshing. He's a type of '70s European Jim Carey who knows how to use his facial expression to achieve maximum success in his comedies. The plot is relatively simple - A finance minister in 16th-17th century Spain loses his position and tries to win it back by taking revenge on those who are responsible for this. His plan may work better than expected in some areas...

Video Quality is quite good and it is an anamorphic widescreen format. One of the few Louis de Funes DVD-s available in the US. Keep them coming...",1149033600,8,596,4.518518518518518

8107740,5,B000E991IO,the best comed movie,1422057600,,20,4.25
8107741,4,B000E991IO,"Not the best from Louis de Funes, but still a pretty good historical comedy that feels like theater-spectacle.  Actually, it is Louis de Funes that makes this film watchable.  His gimmicks and specific sense of humor stand out from the rest of the bleak actors.  What is most appealing for me in Delusions of Grandeur (1972) is the fact that it is a comedy piece set in the times of musketeers roughly in around 17th century...a sort of parody of that historical period.
The action takes place in Spain, and it deals with a high ranking official (Louis de Funes) who gets on the bad side of the Spanish queen. In order to get even with her, he plots with the help of his loyal servant a plan to catch the queen in bed with...will the plan succeed? Watch and find out :)

Definitely a film for all Louis de Funes followers.",1415923200,,822,4.3881578947368425
8107742,2,B000E991IO,Kinda stupid.,1405555200,,13,6.0
8107743,5,B000E991IO,This is again one of the great Luis de Funes movies. His mimic is hillarious.  It's one of those classic movies with a good taste french humour.  The DVD was in perfect condition and properly priced.,1382918400,,199,4.5
8107744,4,B000E991IO,This movie is hilarious!  I just wish the DVD I ordered had sub-titles. There were not any French sub-titles even available. I have seen this movie before but with French sub-titles so I understood more.  Regardless if you speak French - this movie is comedy. Definitely a classic!,1378166400,,281,4.833333333333333
8107745,5,B000E991IO,An excellent old film from an equally excellent actor. I thoroughly recommend it for the lovers of good old comedy films.,1373500800,,121,4.809523809523809
8107746,5,B000E991IO,"I recommend not getting this movie if you don't understand French.  This movie doesn't have English subtitles.

However, it's possible that you may enjoy the movie even without knowing French, as the action is pretty obvious.  Think slapstick, like Jerry Lewis.  Many silents movies didn't need sound to make the funny bits funny.

The movies stars Louis de Funes as a corrupt Spanish tax collector trying to enter the nobility.  Jean-Paul Belmondo stars as his aide who is more interested in helping himself, seducing the new and gorgeous German bride of the king, and occasionally passing money back to the people who've just been taxed by de Funes.  There's various plots of the nobility against de Funes and against the king.

The film works as a comedy.  I wouldn't try to learn any history from it, though.",1346371200,2,812,4.868613138686132
8107747,3,B000E991IO,"After a summer's evening, the coach of Don Sallust, all-powerful Minister of His Majesty the King of Spain, galloping on a dusty road in Andalusia. Behind him, bringuebale by bumps in the road, his valet Blaze, a tall good-natured and clever, is indignant at the rapacity of his master. Queen gets the return of the King and the exile of the unpopular minister. Stripped, sent back, forfeit, ruin, Sallust imagine a diabolical plot to avenge the Queen.

They must not want to sell this movie to those of us who need subtitles.",1333929600,2,526,4.717391304347826
