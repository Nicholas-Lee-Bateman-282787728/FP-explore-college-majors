My favorite duets were the ones with Marco Minnemann, Chad Wackerman and Gene Hoglan.",1443398400,,225,4.380952380952381
8688044,5,B00PHMB0BE,"It my friend John Wacketman, drumming! As always he did a fantastic job in this production and it it's fun to watch. I think all his hard work putting this project together paid off. Mud, I think it's nice for some to see another great Wackerman drumming brother, they might not have been exposed to before. John had a style all his own and its a pleasure to watch & listen to him play. One of my favorite drummers!",1423699200,,415,4.265822784810126
