8236984,4,B00104IY4O,"PARADISE is an interesting SHOWTIME ORIGINAL FILM that demonstrates the famous American-based proverb, ""Behind Great Man is a Great Woman"", but in this case add ""Wanting to be Him"".
The world of televised religion has reached an all-time market share high. The ""televangelist"" is hot and the ministries are flourishing,competitive and full of ""dirty little secrets"".The thing is that though the men are fronts for these ministries, it is the smart and resourceful women who have yet to ""get their balls"" that are the driving forces behind them. Bobby Paradise (David Strathairn) is a former astronaut, now world famous televangelist who is unknowingly the puppet of a wife (Barbara Hershey) and a string of women in the ministry (Elaine Stritch his mother-in-law,Vivienne Benesch his journalist daughter-in-law and Kiersten Warren the sexy lawyer daughter. These women ARE the ministry, and as Bobby is ""propped-up and fed the lines"", the women stay behind the scenes and control it all. They all live in the utmost of luxury and their loyalty to ""their men"" is unquestined and unflappable. References are made to Nancy, Hillary, Tammy Faye and Josephine for making Ronald, Bill,Jim and Napoleon what they were! This is a really well done and fascinating look at the greed,lust and power of religion,but even more generally at the women who want to be the men! 4.5 stars because the ending is really truncated. Other than that....ENJOY and learn!",1197676800,2,1446,5.157446808510638
