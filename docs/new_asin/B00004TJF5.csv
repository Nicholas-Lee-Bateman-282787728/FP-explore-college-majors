7922849,1,B00004TJF5,This DVD is so bad that when they talk about General Winfield Scott they have a picture of General Winfield Scott Hancock. It is so poor I dumped it in a recycle bin. Whoever did this DVD has little knowledge about the American Civil War. One star is more then it deserves.,990662400,10,273,4.269230769230769
