7694337,2,B01CUW9DFS,"I watched every episode of the series at least twice, and loved it.  I was so excited to find out about the movie.  Unfortunately, I felt like it was a huge reach.  There were of course some funny parts, but overall it was a let down.  Unless you've always wanted to see Sammy's junk, then pass on this one and keep the memories of the original series.",1477094400,,352,4.208955223880597
