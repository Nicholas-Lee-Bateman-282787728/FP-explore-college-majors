3962422,3,B002OMIKLI,"If you are expecting a hard, challenging workout, look elsewhere.  The contestants are smiling and laughing at the end of the cardio circuit workout, so you know it can't be that hard.  I much prefer Jillian's Burn Fat Boost Metabolism DVD along with No More Trouble Zones.  These are challenging 55 minute workouts.  Also good are Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt.  I sometimes use Biggest Loser Boot Camp, but it is hard on my knees.  Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga is great for stretching and toning.",1259884800,2,512,4.761363636363637
3962423,3,B002OMIKLI,"I love Jillian Michaels workout videos, but I have to say that this is not one of her best. I expected that with a title like ""Last Chance Workout"" that I would be panting and trying to keep up. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I completed the entire workout using 5 lb. weights and was not nearly as out of breath as I was doing her ""30 Day Shred"" or her two newest videos. I also found the Biggest Loser contestants to be a little distracting. They were not always in sync and doing the moves properly. I'll throw this into my routine, but will not be using it as one of the staples.",1259798400,31,590,4.139130434782609
3962424,5,B002OMIKLI,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian's workouts so I was so excited to try this new one out. And as always, she did not disappoint. I was a little leery at first, because I've never found The Biggest Loser series of workouts to be as challenging as Jillian's other DVD's (BFBM, No More Trouble Zones, 30 Day Shred). I did the whole DVD (about 55 minutes) and my heart rate stayed up and she kicked my butt. The cardio portion was non-stop- 30 seconds of cardio (most of it plyometrics) followed by 30 seconds of a strength move for that entire 25 minutes. Of course there are the usual jump rope and jumping jacks, but she adds variations of these moves to keep it interesting. The plank jacks and the mountain climber/plank jack combo at the end were killer!
Upper body has lots of plank moves/pushups, along with weights- my shoulders and triceps were fried just using 5 lb. weights. It's only 10 minutes, but there is no rest and she really burns those muscles out.
Lower body, again (thankfully) is only 10 minutes. Every variation of lunges and squats that you can possibly do in 10 minutes, and I was really ""feeling the burn"" in my quads by the end of it. And just when you think your legs are DONE,she finishes it with jump squats. I know I will be feeling this one tomorrow.
As for her demeanor and language, c'mon people it's Jill!! I personally find her ""bully"" attitude to be motivating and inspiring. Just look at the results she gets on the show.",1259798400,70,1449,4.430711610486892
3962425,5,B002OMIKLI,"CALORIE BURN: I'll begin with this, considering that's typically why we all buy the dvd, is it not? (Well, you do get a health boost as well...)and I own all the Biggest Loser dvds for a good comparison. I wear a bodybugg (the black arm band you see on the contestants of the Biggest Loser with a monitor attached) to measure my daily caloric expenditure with the most accuracy. Because of this, I am also able to monitor how many calories I burn during a specific workout and how many calories I burn per minute of a workout and how much my calorie burn increases after the workout. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement, rather than perceived exertion.  And this dvd is a high calorie burner!  I have quite an extensive library of dvds to compare it to since I use fitness dvds exclusively to get my workout in 6 days a week. This is a new favorite and truly, offered great strength, toning, and calorie burn. You won't help but get results here. While some of her dvds have more cardio to burn more calories DURING the workout, because of the good strength training, and ""HIIT"" training, you will burn more overall with this one. (see my notes under ""effectiveness"" as to why) It did, however, burn less than her ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" and ""No More Trouble Zones"" dvd.

EQUIPMENT NEEDED: one set of 1 to 10 lb hand weights, based upon your level, if you have a hard floor you may also want a mat for pushups etc. on the floor

EFFECTIVENESS: The beauty of this dvd is that it's not just cardio but, instead, a full circuit workout. Actually it's a ""HIIT"" workout which is a model for highest calorie burn. Studies have shown that when you increase your heart rate with cardio then keep it elevated while combining toning and strength exercises and utilize some core floor work in modules, you get double the results. Cardio burns calories during the workout but you recover quickly and your heart rate recovers and lowers. However, when you add strength training with cardio, you continue to burn more calories long after the workout is over and also add muscle which increases your metabolism and allows your body to burn more calories even while at rest--although strength burns less calories during the workout. So, combining the two is always going to give you better results and faster results which is the entire premise of the workouts you see on the Biggest Loser. An expert had the best analogy as to why you don't feel wiped out in a workout like this compared to an all cardio workout, but yet burn more calories: If you go 90 miles an hour in your car for an entire trip, you will use less fuel than if you go 90 then lower your speed, then rev it up for awhile, then lower it again...keeping your heart rate elevated but not at ""top speed"" and alternating it during a workout will actually burn more calories and, just like a car, use more fuel (calories) in the long run. Old school thinking was that you had to keep your heart rate at max level for best results. The most recent studies showed that the 30 second interval alternation will actually burn more calories. This is what's done in the workout and Jillian mentions the calorie-burn effectiveness of this.

SAFETY: Great instruction not just of how to do the moves, but of how to do them safely if you are a beginner.

LEVEL: Although you'll be well instructed if you are just starting out as to how to get your weight off, this workout will push you if you do the more advanced moves regardless of what level you currently are. You'll sweat. You'll get results. And several of the backup contestants are doing the ""beginner level"" moves so you can follow them until you get up to speed with the more advanced moves.

CAST: Jillian and past contestants. The beauty of the Biggest Loser workouts is that anyone doing them can identify with someone who is on screen because they don't just utilize their skinniest contestants. When you see someone far larger than you pushing themselves you do think ""I can do this."" and I like that.

CUEING: Excellent and easy to follow.

MUSIC: Upbeat and coincides with pace of the moves to keep you revved.

SET: Either it is the Biggest Loser set where they weigh in, or it's made to look like it.

CONTAINS: 3 workouts, warm up and cool down 55 minutes total

COMPARISON TO OTHER BIGGEST LOSER DVDS SPECIFICALLY. I own all of the Biggest Loser dvds as well as the ones individually by Bob and Jillian.  This is one of the tops for calorie burning, second only to Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism""

NEGATIVES: I hate to have to say it, but I had hoped Jillian had mellowed out some...not in her instruction but, rather, in being condescending. Her last dvd offered I think her best ability to shine through as an instructor. She pushed you, but she didn't have that nervous laughter she'd had in her previous dvds and she wasn't condescending for no reason and silly-fake-tough. Well, what I thought she'd pushed aside is back. For me personally, I prefer Bob's tough but positive approach that seems more genuine. But I know others may feel greater results with this approach so you be the judge.  I gotta agree with the other reviewer that calling someone her ""bitch"" in this dvd just seems unprofessional in several regards and I think if a personal trainer said that to me I would have to wonder what testosterone-filled power trip they were on...also when she said ""You messed up! HA HA HA HA HA!"" and the person working out seemed not fond of that comment..it's just odd to me.  However, Jillian is no doubt still an instructor who uses that same pushing to often make you continue when you want to quit so this has a positive aspect to such ""toughness"". And she really knows how to explain the moves and cue well and ensure you do them RIGHT for optimal results as well as compile the highest calorie burning workouts. So I have every dvd she's made. It's an annoyance factor for me, but the good of the dvd outweighs this by far. Also, it doesn't appear as though the team practiced this routine all that much. They are out of sync many times...I personally am not thrown by this and almost feel as though I'm in a gym because this is the norm...but this may be important to others so I thought I would mention it. It is a bit of a shame they don't have it all down but as long as I can do it, I'm good. :-) And, finally, if you were in a fraternity and had to do a shot everytime she said ""Last Chance Workout"" in this dvd you'd be dead to the world within about 7 minutes. Heavey marketing that this is the ""last chance workout"" to the point it's kinda funny.

CONCLUSION: A great addition to any collection that offers great instruction and results. And you can turn off the voice of the trainer and just have the workout on with the music once you get the moves down if you gotta.

3962426,5,B002OMIKLI,"I completed this entire DVD yesterday and I feel it today!  Did I sweat??  Yes!!  The workout is really tough and although there are beginner modifications, I would rate this DVD for an intermediate and up exerciser.

Here's what I liked:

1.  I liked the ability to pick just one workout or complete the entire DVD. The workout starts with a Warm-up--the cover says  5 minutes, but I timed it with my HRM and it ended up being closer to 7 minutes.
The next section ""The Last Chance Workout"" consisted of 5 (five), 30 second circuits.  The circuits switched between cardio and upper/lower body strentgh training moves.  Even though the strentgh training moves we slower, my heartrate still stayed in the aerobic zone the entire time.  The cardio moves were high and low impact--they included jumping jacks, jump rope, squats, kickboxing, etc.  The strength moves included the regular upper/lower body moves with lots of push-ups and planks and variations of both thrown in for good measure...I found them to be the most difficult. This section timed out for me at 26 minutes while the cover says 25 minutes
The Upper/Lower Body  sections (10 minutes each) were again the regular strength moves (lunges, squats, bicep,shoulder, triceps) with variations thrown in..all over a very good hard workout.

I wasn't really happy about not being able to program the DVD like the other Biggest Loser DVD's in the past.  Usually, I can pick one or more sections, add them together and then have a specific perosnal workout. This DVD allows the user to pick one/all or a preprogrammed workout.

I also wasn't very happy with some of Julian's language.  I am very far from a prude, but to me, calling a client  ""my bitch"" is just unprofessional.

Other than the couple of negatives, this DVD is worth every single cent and if you have an MP3 player on your computer, you will even receive a free CD to download...it's a fun workout music --about 125-128 beats per minute.  Enough to get your heart pumping.",1259712000,61,1993,4.7917888563049855
3962427,1,B002OMIKLI,"I'm very disappointed with this video.  I used to love JM but in this, she comes off as condescending and down right repulsive to the contestants.  She even calls one her B***h.  Why would you treat people like that?  There is very little instruction on form and equipment use.  Also, there are no breaks for water.  I do a lot of DailyBurn videos and they do circuit training with short 15 second breaks for water.  I wish I could return this video.

The workout is broken into three sections.  1) warm up and circuit training, 2) upper body, and 3) lower body and stretching.  I was surprised at this.  I was about 27 minutes in and all of a sudden JM says ""That was your last chance workout!"".  Wait what?  Then the screen goes blank for a second and they move into upper body work.  It was odd.",1453420800,,798,4.304054054054054

There is a warm up (I actually always skip this) and then less than 30 minutes of high energy weight lifting moves for 30 seconds followed by cardio. The time goes by quickly, it's a good full body workout and then you can choose 10 min options focused on legs or arms. I don't use these 10 min segments as frequently as I use just the main workout.

3962446,5,B002OMIKLI,"This review is based on the entire hour long workout (which is how I intend to always use this DVD).

Ok, I'm just gonna get straight to the point; this DVD is all you need!!  I am a huge fan of Jillian (either ya love her or ya don't), and I own most of her DVDs. To me, this felt like her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism DVD & No More Trouble Zones DVD combined in one workout (strength plus cardio in one workout).

I wore my lovely Polar FT4 heart rate monitor while doing this workout & apparently I burned 450 calories (I'm 5'3 & I weigh 130)!!  Unbelievably, I only burned 368 calories the last time I did Banish Fat (probably due to the low heart rate during the abs session); and I only burned 220 calories while doing No More Trouble Zones.  So, not only did I get a great workout with cardio & strength combined, but the caloric burn was AMAZING!!

The fact that this workout contains cardio & strength all in one is so great because I don't have to alternate days!  What a time saver!!  I honestly didn't think this workout would be challenging because I consider myself at a pretty good fitness level already, but I should've known that Jillian wouldn't disappoint me!!  If you only plan on working out at home sometimes, you should get this DVD because it has it all.  Again, I would recommend doing the entire workout (if you can) for a great burn, but the entire 6 week program also looks like it's well broken down into suitable workouts for an effective weight loss program.

Oh, and just because Jillian doesn't incorporate isolated ab toning sessions, that doesn't mean your core will be neglected. Plenty of plank exercises!

This DVD was worth every penny!",1408406400,,1674,4.452459016393442
3962447,5,B002OMIKLI,"This workout is no joke!  I have been doing this workout for 2 weeks now and it is A M A Z I N G!!!  Be prepared to work out with Jillian.  Its high intensity.  You will begin sweating within 5 minutes of beginning the workout but you will absolutely see results within two weeks even without doing all the steps and repetition with the Biggest Looser.  There is a modified version with each workout and you do need to have some dumb bells to work out with the dvd.

I absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about working out.  You will be working out 6 days per week (Monday - Saturday) for 30 minutes each day.  I do this workout at nights and do the Biggest Looser Abs workout in the mornings 10 minutes every day.  These two dvd's are the only workout you need to get in shape.  You will absolutely love it and see the results in as little as two weeks.",1407888000,8,873,4.142857142857143
3962448,5,B002OMIKLI,This is intense and i love it! My husband even likes it!  We sweat a LOT and it's fun too because the intervals move so quickly.

I only  struggled on the mountain climbers and the in and outs.
I also found it strange that the last chance workout was about 30 minutes - Jillian says hey congratulations you just finished your last chance workout and then it goes right into a workout for the upper body, followed by a lower body workout.  maybe it just happens this way on the digital version.
like other reviewers I didn't like that there was not any explanation as  to what move we were doing next so I feel like i fell behind... but after a few times watching I think I'll get it.

I've previously done Jillian's 30 day Shred (and still do) and Lesley Sansone's, Jessica Smith and Karen Voight.

I found the ""regular"" people refreshing and did as one reviewer said, upped the cardio a bit in the beginning of the intervals doing a bit more to keep my heart rate up. It does get harder as it goes on.  I felt it was challenging and you can make it harder by increasing the weight with the strength section. Jillian doesn't do many exercises in her DVD's and she doesn't here but she does give good cues. (a little too chatty at times)

It always seems something is lacking, here it's abs, but I can do those on my own and with other DVD's. In her 30 Day Shred, it was triceps, so I added them instead of doing more biceps You don't' have to be OCD with exercise DVD's..you can tweek them a little.

I have to admit, after doing a few of Jillian's and others, this was the first time I woke up feeling it and had a leg cramp in the middle of the night...don't skimp n stretching later. ; ) It was much more powerful that it looked and I broke a plateau and lost 2 pounds.

The exercises are adequate, however, some of the moves require some precise instruction so that the person does not injury themselves.
Instead of giving any helpful instruction, Jillian only yammers nonsense, for her own benefit.  Her comments are condescending, rude and uninspiring.  At one point she calls one person a ""bitch"" and in general makes fun of the group working out. Occasionally, she laughs when she finds her own comments funny.
How anyone can find her of any use is beyond me.  She reminds of the evil girl, Nancy, from the movie ""The Craft"", played by Fairuza Balk.  She is just as vile and nasty as the character.",1354838400,5,859,4.731543624161074

This is actually not bad. I did it for the first time in a zillion years, because when you have a zillion workout DVDs some get neglected. :)

The warm up and cool downs are kind of lame, and if you're short on time, skip them.

This is broken up into 5 sections: warm up (5 min), last chance workout (25 min), upper body (10 min), lower body (10 min), cool down (5 min).

The last chance workout part needs some more oomph for sure. Only the last circuit was challenging. This is a good, mild workout if you're really not in the mood. HOWEVER, once you get to the upper/lower, things pick up. I DID however have to do 2 sets of 25 jump squats during these two sections to keep my heartrate really up. I did sweat a LOT (well, not having A/C and fan on helped for sure!). Overall I would recommend this workout.

Note: girls like me who build muscle REALLY easily and quickly....use 2 lb weights. Sounds lame but you can really rep it out and not bulk up.",1342137600,,999,4.182291666666667

  I had how she does not explain how to properly do the moves, no demonstrations, unlike her other DVD's. I often find myself confused about what to do at first, but eventually I fall into rhythm. I prefer when she discusses proper form, and what muscles I am working. She does a bit here, but she goes into more details in other DVDs
  The biggest loser contestants throw me off, I prefer the athletic fit girls in her other videos, they are in sync, and don't mess up moves. They are not lazy with moves either.  I like to watch one person and since the contestants are out of sync and I am not explained the moves, it throws me for a loop.
  You just need some basic weights and thats great, I am too cheap to buy weights so I just use any water bottles around me
I like that she doesn't give breaks, everything is quick quick quick and that does not allow me to get too bored.
  Only with Jillian I know I am getting a good workout. I used to do some DVDs in high school, but her videos are the best.
Make sure you have a great internet, mine is a little slow and stops CONSTANTLY, it irritates me! I also have a Mac and cant download the stupid thing. So beware!
  I feel like her other 2 Dvds I prefer were more challenging. I barely made through those videos, stopping every minute to catch my breath. And it's not like I am overweight too, I just weight slightly less than 140 and I am 5ft 2in tall. This DVD made me sweat, but not like her other videos.

3962507,5,B002OMIKLI,"I read the reviews before buying this and if you do it EXACTLY like the DVD, it could be a tadbit of a let-down.  But, the HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) is where it is at...especially if you know how to REALLY do it!!  This DVD goes between 30 seconds of cardio and 30 seconds of cool-down (with weights).  This is your biggest bang for buck in kicking out those calories.  I just finished the workout about 20-25 minutes ago and my heart rate still has not returned to a full resting rate (read this as STILL burning calories)!  The key here is to do the 30 second cardio parts to the MAX!  The 30-second cardio moves toward the end of the 24 minute workout are already at the max, but the ones at the beginning of the workout seem a little weak.  Here is what I did....during the beginning ones that seem weak, just double-triple time the moves (I closed my eyes while doing cross punches and such so as not to mess myself up with the slower timing of the people on the screen).  Make sure you are working your ABSOLUTE HARDEST during each of those 30 second cardio segments.  Then, use the weight time to work nice and slow and allow your heart rate to cool down.  Most of the time, my heart rate was in the high 150s and during the cool-downs only came down to the high 130s or 140s.  Pretty awesome!  I use a calorie monitor (don't know how effective it is for sure), but I got a total of 544 calories burned in 39 minutes!  But, remember, I pushed each of those 30-second cardio moves as hard as I could.  I am 47 years old, fairly fit, lost about 15 pounds using Jillian's other DVDs, but put some back on during the holidays. Was also looking to incorporate HIIT training...so glad Jillian had a 30/30 one that wasn't too hard!  Because of the added holiday weight, I have another 10-15 pounds to lose to my goal!  With the added ""ooomph"" to the beginning cardio moves, this was a great work-out!  Can't wait to see how it works over time!! :)",1293840000,6,1961,4.314207650273224
3962508,3,B002OMIKLI,"I'm a huge Jillian fan, so it pains me to say this but this is not one of her best DVDs.  (Yes, I know it's technically a BL DVD, but still.)

If you're a beginner and are looking for a friendly, casual type of DVD, this would probably be perfect.  It's a nice mix of cardio intervals and strength moves.  However!  If you've been doing Jillian's other DVDs -- particularly Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones -- you should only purchase this if you have some kind of Jillian-compulsion (""Must! Own! Every! DVD!"") or if you want a workout you can do without coughing up a lung when you're recovering from a cold.

Those who are irritated by people being out of synch or having wobbly form shouldn't get this, or probably any of BL DVDs.  These guys are not professionals; they're normal people.  Personally, I find them inspiring, and like the banter between them.  (Also, I think the reviewers saying that some of the participants aren't in great shape are  missing the point.  You don't watch The Biggest Loser for perfect bodies at the end -- you watch for an emotional/physical journey.  If you want perfect bodies, go for Jillian's BFBM/NMTZ DVDs and feast your eyes on Kristin's thighs.)",1292889600,2,1212,4.63849765258216

3962515,4,B002OMIKLI,"Just tried out this workout and it is killer! I have been doing a rotation of several Jillian DVD's for about 4-months and was getting bored and decided to add a new one. One of things that I felt was missing from my other DVD's was solid lower body results. Most of them are always a lot of kickboxing and sculpting of the arms. But, I never once felt sore in my legs. After doing this dvd's lower body workout, my thighs felt ALIVE! The burn is no joke here. I used 5lb weights and the first time I did Last Chance + Upper body back to back I couldn't get through it all. Now, I am not sure if this is a massive calorie burner though. I felt the cardio circuits were very basic calisthenics, not super high intensity and not very interesting. You will sweat though, don't get me wrong. I just love the sculpting here.

Now, I also understand people taking issue with Jillian's lack of professionalism in some of this, especially when compared to my other DVDs from her (shred, BFBM, NMTZ). But, she still does a great job motivating, explaining the moves, and gives you a hardcore workout. If you are like me and use DVDs mostly for cues and background noise, then this is perfect. But, if you are the type who is glued to the screen and hangs on every word, then yes, you might get annoyed.

Overall, LOVE this workout! It is a great compliment to other Jillian DVDs.",1283212800,6,1370,4.326848249027237
3962516,5,B002OMIKLI,"The cardio section in this workout is very intense. Although it runs for around 20 minutes it's very gruesome that I had to stop the DVD a few times to catch my breath. I like the 5+ minutes of warmup before starting my workout. This DVD is divided into:
5+ minutes warmup
20+ minutes cardio with strength training
10+ minutes upper body with weights
10+ minutes lower body with weights
5 minutes stretching and cooldown
***This workout doesn't include much ab excercises other than the short standing waist rotations.
At the end of the DVD you'll be seriously winded. However if you do this workout a few times you'll have more endurance and you'll recover easily and quickly from the workouts.

It's an hour long for the whole workout so I skip the part for upper body as I don't want to bulk up and instead work on my abs.
  I love Jillian and she's an inspiration for me to work harder.",1282953600,2,993,4.304812834224599
3962517,5,B002OMIKLI,"I bought this DVD and another Jillian Michael's workout about a month ago, but only recently found the motivation to use them. First off, the people who are giving this a poor review or saying it's 'not challenging enough' obviously aren't trying. Any workout is as hard or easy as you make it, and trust me, you have to work really hard to make this one easy. Only a few days in, I'm incredibly sore, but it's that kind of sore that you don't mind, because you know it means you got a good workout, and believe me, it is. As gross as it is to admit, I don't think I've ever sweat that much in my life. A few negative notes, though... The warmup is a little short in my opinion, not enough stretching, but there is enough in the cool down. Also, the first few times you do the exercises you'll probably be a few seconds behind; Jillian doesn't do a great job of explaining all of them. By the third day, though, it gets easier to keep up as you remember how they all work. I've already started to lose some weight, and that in itself is great motivation to keep going. I think everyone reaches a point in there life that they realize something about their life needs to change, and for me, this is it. I think that for anyone who feels the same, this DVD is a great place to start. Don't get overwhelmed or quit because it hurts, because trust me, you will be very, very sore. Just remember, nothing worth doing is easy.",1282435200,,1420,4.243542435424354
3962518,5,B002OMIKLI,"Coming home from my freshman year at college, I was horrified to find that I had gained a whopping TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS! In a hot panic, and thinking there had to be a solution to my chubby cheeks, I went out looking for any workout DVDs that I could find.

In a streak of luck, I found myself in the ""Biggest Loser"" aisle of Target, surrounded by such DVDs as ""The 30 Day Shred"", ""Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism"", and ""The Last-Chance Workout"". Knowing I had nothing to lose (but the weight), I bought all three.

For the first month, I used the 30-day shred. The second, I used the Burn Fat Boost Metabolism, and for the third, I used the Last Chance Workout.

Through it all, I lost all 25 pounds and I owe it all to these easy-to-follow DVDs! I'm not going to sugar-coat it, you will be sweaty, you will be yelling profanities at the television, and you will be out of breath.

But you know what? You will also lose the weight.

I wish you all luck!",1281916800,13,947,4.268156424581005

I have been doing this workout for about 2-3 weeks now and I still enjoy it! Also, instead of building a lot of muscle and not losing very much weight like on the 30 day shred I have shed 4 pounds in one week without changing my eating habits! (keep in mind that I am 5""4 and 133, now 129 so it is hard for me to lose a bunch of weight) I found it challenging but not extremely hard. There are a bunch of different circuts so it never gets boring. I used 5lb weights and I like how lighter weights tone but don't build a ton of muscle. There are also a large variety of cardio circuts about 30 seconds per circut so you don't get stuck doing the same exercise for too long which is really nice.

You find yourself a few seconds  behind. you have to watch the people do the work out before you know what to do, so you lag behind. also question the wisdom of week 5-6 of doing the same workout out every day for 6 days a week for 2 weeks. i thousght you are suppose to rest muscles for 24-48 hours. like the original biggest loser dvd with bob. recommend jari love over this. barely broke a sweat",1277683200,5,536,4.306930693069307

I purchased the last chance workout a week ago and tried it for the first time yesterday. I didn't think it was tough enough. I used 5 lbs weights (which is usually more than enough when I do the 30 day shred) I'm not sore at all from my work-out yesterday. Although I did work up quite a sweat.

3962524,4,B002OMIKLI,"I liked this video. It's a good cardio workout with great toning exercises and has added variety to my toning as I have been solely doing Jillian's 'No More Trouble Zones' for weight toning. This vidoe has 25 minutes of cardio and 10 minutes of arms and legs each.

I gave this video 4 vs. 5 stars because the cardio portion does not quite reach the cardio level as Jillian's 'Banish Fat Boost Metabolism' and even though the toning portions definitely worked my muscles, I had a bit more of sweat when toning with 'No More Trouble Zones.'

Pros: The addition of exercises I have not seen before: floating lunges with a balance move (these kill me) and plank shoulder raises (I have to do half of these with one knee down). I'm in pretty good shape working out 6 days a week and definitely was challenged by some of the toning exercises.

Cons: The cardio was just not as tough as some of Jillian's other videos. This would have been okay as videos all have different strengths but this video was marketed as a 'Last Chance Workout.' On the show, the contestants look like they are about ready to pass out or die in the last chance workouts and this was not the case during this workout. Tara actually smiles almost the whole way through. While I did get a good workout, I was not huffing and puffing like I do on other workouts of Jillian.

One other comment regarding Jillian's 'motivation techniques...I know some people don't like the yelling of the name calling (she calls one of the contestants 'her Bitch'....in jest). I honestly don't mind this. I need a bit of a hard hand to motivate me through these workouts....her tough love style works for me. I really feel that she actually cares....kind of like parents, we only ground our kids or give them rules because we love them (granted most people don't call their kids names, even when joking, but we're all adults here).",1275782400,,1880,4.553254437869822

BIG thumbs up!!!",1274227200,,677,4.067669172932331
3962529,5,B002OMIKLI,"So there are 3 levels of workouts--weeks 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 (it's built as a 6-week weight loss program for those who are starting at beginner fitness levels).  Thinking I was already a badass in tiptop shape, I immediately jumped to weeks 5-6 in the hopes that I would find a real butt-kicker of a workout.  When the program started, I was DELIGHTED to see my girl-crush Jillian surrounded by some of my favorites from BL Season 8, including Sione, Alan, Liz, Amanda, Danny, Daniel, and Tara from Season 7 as an added bonus.  We began with a 5 minute warm-up, which sufficiently got my blood pumping and my early-morning yawns to subside (I did this before work this morning).  After the warm-up, we began a 25 minute workout that included 5 different circuits of cardio and strength training, alternating between the two (aside here: I just read an article in a fitness journal about how effective interval training of strength and cardio is for calorie burning and muscle toning--how you get your maximum workout by doing strength moves with weights and then in between, you do a minute or so of cardio...which is exactly what this workout is so I was thrilled!).  What was instantly refreshing to me was that none of the participants knew the workout in advance, so they seemed as clueless as I was as a first-timer to this workout (another aside: I really dislike workout videos where everyone knows what's going on except for me, and then the first couple of times doing the DVD, I feel like a total idiot; but no one knew what was going on here, so it was really nice to have other clueless people with me).  I was getting through the circuits just fine, sweating a bit, heart rate pumping, thinking to myself, ""this really isn't so bad!'"" and just as I uttered those words in my head, BAM!  Jillian had us on the ground doing mountain climbers, plank-jacks, and I think even some pushups...and I felt like I was going to die!  Fortunately, it was the last circuit in the 25 minute program so I toughed it out; but I do have to say that towards the end of the last circuit, I really did have to use the BL contestants as a motivator thinking, ""If those fatsos can do it, what excuse do I have?!"" (not that all of them were fatsos, mind you, but I tend to get a bit snarky when I'm being forced to do plank jacks and all I want to do is give up...no offense, BL contestants--I love you all! You're an inspiration!).  As soon as I thought I just couldn't do any more, the 25 minute circuit was over and Jillian was congratulating me on a job well done.

Note: the 5 minute warm up and 25 minute workout are absolutely fine as a stand-alone workout--if you only have 30 minutes to spare, it'll give you a good run for your money...strength training, cardio, lots of core work...totally fine workout on its own.  HOWEVER, if you REALLY want your ""Last Chance Workout"", you let the DVD keep playing and then you find...

A 15 minute upper body workout that is great for sculpting and toning your back, arms, and shoulders.  It, too, was pretty smooth sailing in the beginning; but just as I thought, ""this really isn't so bad!"", BAM!  My shoulders were on fire and felt like my arms were going to fall off.  It was awesome!  I was using 5 pound weights, but you could easily lower or increase the weights based on your fitness level.  If it's too easy, then increase the weights a couple of pounds and I guarantee that you'll get a great upper body workout.  After I thought my shoulders were going to fall off, it was time to hit the deck and do plank rows and plank flies which again caused me to shout out ""If Danny can do it, so can I"", because I really didn't know how I was going to finish them.  They were brutal (in a good way though)!  And now that I think about it, I can't remember if these plank rows and flies were in the upper body portion or the lower body portion...I think they were upper body...I can't remember now.  All I know is that they were super hard and made my core feel like it was on fire!  It was great!

Note: you probably wouldn't want to do JUST this upper body workout as it's only 15 minutes and doesn't really have any cardio in it, but if you're looking for something to tone your upper body AFTER you do something else (like go for a run or a walk at the park), then you could absolutely do just this circuit and get a good upper body tone.

Once the upper body workout was finished, it was on to a 10 minute lower body workout, which mainly consisted of squats and lunges with weights (and a tiny bit of cardio).  Again, I used my 5 pound weights and got a very nice lower body workout.  I may increase my weights next time to 8 pounds just to get an even better workout, as I could have handled it on some of the squats and lunges; regardless though, it, too, was a great workout that wouldn't necessarily be adequate as a stand-alone but could easily be a ""tack on"" to other cardio you're doing.

Note:  looking back, you could easily use the upper body and lower body circuits as a ""tack on"" to a run or walk at the park to get great toning into your workout.  Together they would only take 25 minutes, but should be a nice addition to whatever cardio you're doing (if you prefer to mix up your cardio but still get in some strength training).

After the lower body workout, we moved to a 5 minute cool down, which I have to say I was very glad to do.  By the end of the workout, I was sufficiently sweaty, with several aching muscles and a nicely elevated heart rate.  55 minutes total but with the circuits and moving through the different programs, it went by very quickly and didn't seem like 55 minutes at all.

Pros: (Lots of pros!)
Doesn't take up much space at all--was able to do it in my bedroom in front of my bed with plenty of room to move; easy for any sized house or apartment
All you need is a set of hand weights--you can use a yoga mat if you want, but the only time you get on the ground is to do plank work and pushups so you don't even really need a mat
Moves quickly and doesn't seem like 55 minutes at all!
Great combo of cardio, strength training, core work, and toning
Past contestants are very motivating and nice friendly faces

Cons: (Not many cons at all)
Jillian doesn't do the best job of explaining the moves before the contestants do them, so sometimes you're lost the first move or two--problem will correct itself with repeated uses
Background music is sucky but it always is

Overall review:
Great workout, nice addition to anyone's fitness DVD collection--even for those who are already fit!",1274140800,13,6571,4.353808353808354

As I've said in one of my other workout reviews, I reveal this not toot my own horn, but to give you a gauge of someone who feels they are in pretty decent shape.

Overall, I found this DVD to be very, very challenging.  I jumped right into the last week and therefore, did the entire DVD at once.  They have a plan to follow during different weeks so you don't overdo it.  Based on my history, I thought I could jump right into it no problem. :)

I can honestly say the ONLY workout I've ever done that left me this sore the day after was P90X.  I'm walking funny up the stairs (and just in general around the house), my arms hurt just typing this and I was sweating pretty dang good during the 55 minute DVD.

When you do the whole DVD, Jillian really only leaves hard-core ab stuff out.  She explains this during the workout as something along the lines she doesn't like the sit-up/crunch mentality.  She's more of an all around work your core girl (planks, walking planks, push-ups etc).

For $8 this is a steal of a workout.  I finished the workout fully thinking I would wake up the next day and do it again.  Not only did I not do it the following day, I had a heck of a time getting out of bed as my muscles were in so much pain.

This one just missed the mark for me. I had a very difficult time following the participants, many had sloppy form and they acted goofy throughout the video. It was not motivational. For someone new to exercising, I would not recommend this one. It's too easy to get hurt without proper form.

Also, in order to feel like I really get a decent workout, I have to do all 3 segments back-to-back. I just don't feel the same burn as I do with the 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones.",1265760000,,821,4.256410256410256

None are the same at all, and each will kick your butt! However...YOU need to make that happen. It's your intensity that will make it work. So if you are a ""fluffy trainer type"" person, then you probably won't like Jillian. Although she does talk about beginner moves and promotes doing the easier moves if that is what your body is telling you what to do. She also helps encourage you to give it your all. She just a ""tells it like it is kind of gal"" and helps push you to be your best. No half assing it. It's YOUR workout she says...you buy the DVD, you do the work. Each of her DVD's have different routines, but the message is the same if you want your outer shell to be hot, then you also need to work on your inner shell, your mind & nutrition have to be in the game with you as well.

I do this along with eliptical training, zumba, and core fusion body sculpt DVD so I can mix it up.  (2 each day)  Great motivation too.",1265241600,,541,3.8018018018018016

3962550,5,B002OMIKLI,"This is a great workout and it doesn't get boring!  Jillian gets your heartrate up and keeps in there with circuit training.....you sculpt & tone with the weights and then add bursts of cardio...there are 3 sections to this video so you can do one, two or all three depending on what kind of workout you need to do for the day.  Enjoy!",1265155200,,335,4.301587301587301
3962551,4,B002OMIKLI,"The latest two-pack in the ongoing Biggest Loser DVD series combines the idea of 'jump starts' (mini-workouts for those just jumping on the fitness train) and 'last chances' (a phrase taken from the show that really doesn't have much to do with the workout itself). With 'Last Chance', you're given essentially two workout programs - which partially accounts for the slightly lower grade I'm giving this DVD. Other Biggest Loser DVDs give you anywhere from 3 to 8 workouts (depending on how you look at it) that can be combined in a variety of ways.

The first actual 'Last Chance' workout is about 25 minutes long and incorporates 6 cycles of approximately 3-4 minutes each. Each cycle involves 3 variations of a cardio move and 3 variations of a strength move in alternating 30-45 second bursts. For example, you might do 3 different types of a jump rope move interspersed with three different sculpting moves that target your triceps. Overall this is a pretty challenging but engaging workout, and the short, defined timelines for each move makes it a lot more tolerable than say, Bob's endless slow countdowns on other Biggest Loser dvds. You definitely feel like you're getting a solid H2T workout and mixing in cardio provides you with the best of both worlds.

The other workout is actually two separate segments, one targeting your upper body and one targeting your lower body. It's moreso a sculpting workout without the direct integration of cardio, but you'll certainly get your heart pumping with this combo as well. There are many similar moves between this workout and the last chance one, but also some variation. If you like sculpting, you'll appreciate the focus on that with these segments.

Aside from the aforementioned two-workout limitations of this DVD, there are two other strikes I'd lay against it. The first is there isn't really any progression involved. People who've used the last four Biggest Loser DVDs or tried out Jillian Michaels' 30-Day Shred (which employs a similar circuit training method to the 'Last Chance' system) are used to a progression of working out. With the 'Last Chance', it's really kind of a plateau. You can get better, you can (maybe) use heavier weights, and you can move up from beginner moves to advanced ones - but chances are you'll find the beginner moves easy peasy off the get go - so really, there ain't much more to go on. Of course, you can (as I do) use these workouts with other DVDs for some variation - I just don't think it's as well-suited as other DVDs I've used in allowing you to do a four or six-week progression of difficulty. You'll get bored because of the lack of workouts, and you'll probably be able to do most of the moves off the hop.

The other critique I and many others have is Jillian's attitude on this DVD is a bit much. She's a tad over the top in berating the contestants and yelling, which seem like a caricature expected of TV's toughest trainer and aren't that beneficial to the contestants or the viewers. Because of this overemphasis on 'personality', the actual instruction and focus on form is diminished. A major problem with ALL Biggest Loser DVDs is the contestants generally aren't in sync, and many aren't using proper form. Although this DVD is marginally better in the form department, Jillian's lack of guidance on what move is next and how to perform it correctly really screws up the synchronization for the contestants (and potentially you at home) - it would have been better if she kicked off each move with the contestants before talking about form, as she does with her 30-Day Shred DVD.

Overall I'm happy I own this DVD. It provides variation among the 10+ workout DVDs I own, the workouts are challenging but engaging, and they're not the same song & dance you've seen on other DVDs in the series. There are some issues, but as long as this is part of a larger program and not your sole tool to get in shape, I think you'll be satisfied. I recommend 3 to 8 lb weights for women by the way...I typically use 5 but there are a few moves that I could upgrade on or downgrade on. The 'Last Chance' workout with its high-intensity cardio intervals is best suited to a lighter skew.",1265068800,3,4193,4.70708446866485

I run on a regular basis and also did Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred before receiving this as a Christmas Gift.  THIS WORKOUT IS WAY BETTER THAN THE SHRED DVD!  It is not overly easy but you can set your pace to keep up and also follow either the beginner contestants or the advanced ones for your level.  You can also make it a 1/2 hour work out, a 45 minute workout, or an hour long workout to fit your time schedule for that particular day!  There is lots of versatility and it is a GREAT workout!

3962556,4,B002OMIKLI,"This workout is great.  I need a workout that gets me toned and fit in the least amount of time.  This video does just that.  The circuit training, which is the Last Chance Workout segment, is fabulous.  You can alter the levels by adding weights.  The other sections are good too, but the circuit is my favorite.  I have a busy life, and just don't have time to be working out 1.5 hours or more a day.  I have a super fast metabolism, and this actually kicked it up some more and now I have to do a protein shake a day, PLUS increased calories- it's that good!

Another plus with the video is it is fast paced.  I have major concentration problems when it comes to working out.  This keeps me engaged so much that I am not staring at the clock constantly, wishing this boring workout would finish.

Outside of this video, I even started replicating some of the moves on my own, like the invisible criss cross jump rope, plank, and butt kicks.

The only think I am not too crazy about it Jillian.  Her comments I can do without, although the video does leave a music only option.",1264291200,,1079,4.282178217821782
3962557,4,B002OMIKLI,"Not a fitness expert, just one of those 40-somethings who wants to be healthier.

A little over a year ago I decided that my life was going to change one day at a time, one little choice at a time. Since then I have slowly lost 30 pounds and three sizes. Slowly. Our family has gone mostly organic or real foods, and though we indulge (and then regret) an occasional fast food splurge, we are all the happier for the food changes. Exercise has become part of the package. Pilates, walking, Wii workouts, different DVDs. While I'm not planning to do a marathon anytime soon I am attempting to work out more consistently looking for efficiency i.e. getting the most bang for my sweat.

I began watching Biggest Loser, the show, and find it inspires me on my journey because it goes deeper than weight loss, its change from the inside out, working toward healthier and better because we only get one shot at life.

That said, I appreciate the Biggest Loser DVDs that I have had the opportunity to view because they are encouraging, pointing toward health and better choices and movement. The participants aren't models, they are real people with real issues. Like Danny (Season 8 winner) in the midst of his transformation and with his knee/hip problems. Amanda and Liz from Season 8 still carrying extra weight, Daniel, Sione, Tara and Allen round out the ""cast."" Jillian leads them, and us, through the paces. A warm up, a cardio set, upper and lower body workouts and a cool down. Week one and two is the 30ish minutes of Warm up, Cardio and Cool down every other day alternating with the warm up, upper and lower body workouts, cool down. Week three and four are a 45 minute continuation of the same with the warm up, cool down and cardio and upper or lower each day. Week five and six is the whole shebang every day.

I don't want to meet Jillian in a dark alley, or in the gym. She seems so nice, so sweet, friendly on this workout video, but hints of her intentions and desire to strip the fat from the purchaser's body eeks out during some truly chilling moments. Some of the banter gets a little annoying especially when you've heard it several times. I did appreciate that the music isn't overpowering.

The workouts are challenging. Cardio bursts including jogging in place, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, boxing moves, jump rope (without the jump rope) are all flat-out, work to your potential go, go, go. In between these she adds strength moves incorporating hand weights. She takes the time to explain her reasoning and very basic form and how-to (though not on each move and not in full detail). Plank moves are abundant. Jillian explains the reason she likes different types of exercise (like boxing) because they are fat blasters. Her routines incorporate many muscle groups and she explains that the core is the focus of her sets.

I think this should challenge mid to moderate folks. The very advanced might consider it too easy, though she does say that with added weights or some small change-ups it will do what it's designed to do for all fitness levels. Beginners are able to watch two participants who keep the intensity low and modify the moves. The routines are easier to follow than crazy-fast aerobics, though Jillian keeps things moving. For the price, it's going to go into my library and I've ordered Shred because the reviews say it's a monster.",1264118400,,3379,4.670588235294118

Day two consisted of the warm-up, upper body sculpt, lower body tone, and a cooldown. And I hate to say it... but this workout is terrible! The warm-up is not effective at all, the last chance workout was not difficult, and the upper and lower body sculpting sessions are easy even for beginners. Jillian does not participate in any of the workouts, and the contestants don't really seem like they know what they're doing, either. There are no explanations as to how to complete each move and nobody is moving in sync. This workout seems like it was thrown together in a few minutes. It is absolutely terrible, and the fact that Jillian Michaels used her image to market this item is astounding to me.

3962560,5,B002OMIKLI,"I really liked this DVD.  I work out with DVDs alot and this one will definitely make its way into the rotation.  I typically like the Biggest Loser DVDs.  This one I particularly like because the main component of the workout is in an interval form.  (You do 30 second cardio activity followed by a 30 second strength move.)  I have always liked this type of workout and I feel it makes the workout seem to go faster.

Overall, the workout was a good workout, but I agree it is not super difficult.  I workout often and was definitely worked out by this DVD.  My HRM said I burned over 500 calories for the 55 minutes (which is a typical burn for me with any workouts I do).  One more thing...as the other posters have said...definitely follow Tara when trying to figure out the move.  She seemed to remember the routine better than the others and starts moving before them (and she does it correcty).

Overall, I think this DVD is well worth the purchase.",1263081600,,957,4.411428571428571
3962561,4,B002OMIKLI,"I've been doing Jillian's 30 Day Shred workout for quite a while now.  It got to be a bit too easy for me and I had to add weights and change up some of the moves.  Plus, after about a year of doing the workout, I started to get bored with it.

I received the Last Chance Workout as a Christmas gift and I've only been doing it for a week, but I love it.  I do still use heavier weights and ankle weights as I did with the Shred, because I like more of a challenge.  However, this workout makes me sweat far more than the Shred ever did.  I have a feeling I will do much better with this workout.

The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that there are no workouts for your abs.  I'm only on the Week 1 & 2 workouts, so the workouts for your abs may show up later.  But, either way, that's something I'm really looking for in my daily routine.  So, after busting my butt for a half hour with Last Chance, I have to work out my abs on my own.  That's the only reason I have this DVD 4 stars instead of 5.",1262995200,,1012,3.8173076923076925
3962562,5,B002OMIKLI,I love this workout DVD.  Last chance workout with Jillian in your house... what could be better.  I like that it is fast paced and that she yells.,1262822400,,147,4.214285714285714
3962563,5,B002OMIKLI,"I almost didn't get this video because of some of the negative reviews. But A. Chandler's (incredibly helpful!!) review convinced me otherwise. She's burning more with her bodybugg? I'm in! That's what it's all about. Burn those calories, tone my body, feel and look great! But do the whole video with the toning sections, the workout is only 30 minutes. Do ""Play All"" for a great workout.

For starters, if you're looking to start a fitness program, I wouldn't start with this. Because of some of the negative reviews - not hard enough, contestants not doing moves correctly or in sync - I would recommend starting with the 30 Day Shred. You will learn most of the moves properly, and you will learn how to intensify moves when you're ready, therefore it will never be 'easy' unless you let it be.

To address some of the negatives:

It's not hard enough. Hmm. It's as hard as you want it to be. I intensify any where I can. Instead of holding the weights, I curl. Instead of just holding my knee up (I think it's circuit 4) I extend the leg with my curls. Still too easy? Get heavier weights. These are things you learn from 30 Day Shred. I also have Banish Fat and No More Trouble Zones.

Contestants aren't moving correctly or in sync. Well, maybe not. But, they're up there doing it. I really don't get a fitness video for entertainment, I get it to guide me. You shouldn't be doing that much watching, you should be focusing on your workout and the muscles you're working. Again, don't use this video for starters and you'll be ok. I love that the contestants are on the video. Whether they're right or wrong in their moves I don't care. They motivate me. Look at Danny in this video and look at him at the end of the show. It's amazing! And if I want to stop doing mountain climbers I keep it up because they are. All of these contestants had amazing results. That motivates me.

Jillian's language. Ok, mute it. I'm too busy concentrating on my moves and focusing on the muscles I'm working that I don't even hear most of what she says. The video is a guide. I'm getting results and I thank all of Jillian's videos for it. She can call me or anyone else anything she wants if it gets me moving.

No more excuses folks.

About me: I'm a 42 yr old female. I have a joint disease that affects all the joints in my body. I have had 5 surgeries, 3 of which are abdominal. My last abdominal surgery was just over 2 years ago and I let myself go a bit. I had plenty of excuses to use and I used them. I got lazy and out of shape. This past September I saw a picture of myself and I didn't like it. I bought the 30 Day Shred. My life started to change. I started to learn about fitness, learn about how to eat, learn about muscle groups. I used to be thin to the point my friend told me I looked like Nicole Richie. Well, I don't want to look like Nicole Richie (when she was looking anorexic). I want to see muscle and definition. I started to see that with these videos. I'm getting 'sexy arms'. I'm getting ab definition and those 'cool V muscles'. I have about 10 more pounds to lose to get to where I think I should be, although I focus more on how I look than my weight.

My advice if you're starting out: Start with the 30 Day Shred, you will learn a lot. Move to Banish Fat and the No More Trouble Zones videos. Use the TZ video for toning. Add in this video. Once you're comfortable with all of them, rotate them for different workouts, and ideally do this video or Banish Fat in the morning and do TZ at night or get on the treadmill. On those days where you just don't think you have time, AT LEAST do the 30 Day Shred - it only takes 30 minutes.

It's hard. I have days I don't want to workout. But once you see results it will motivate you. I NEVER thought I would be able to kick as high as I can. I NEVER thought I would be able to jog, and I've strengthened the muscles around my joints to the point that I can jog a mile and a half. If you knew me you would be amazed!

3962564,4,B002OMIKLI,"I thought this DVD was a petty good workout.  I am in good shape, I run most days of the week for 30 minutes plus do 30 minutes of additional exercise.  I agree with most of what has been said so far, yes the contestants did not seem to have it together, Jillian was a little cutesy and there are better Biggest looser DVDs out there.  In all though I think it does a good job of traning your whole body.  Though you are not specically training your abs as far as doing crunches, by doing other exercises within the workout you are actually training your abs.  I did it two days in a row now and I have to say my arms are sore, my legs are sore, and so are my abs.  I would say that if you are used to doing excercise daily it would be an aid to what you are doing already on some of the days but not a replacement for anything that you are currently doing.  I did think that it was doing to be more challenging then it was, but I did sweat, and I am sore, so it must have done something for me!",1262304000,,995,3.87192118226601
3962565,4,B002OMIKLI,"I own almost all of the Biggest Loser DVDs as well as all of Jillian's DVDs. I consider myself to be at least at an intermediate level as far as exercise. I've done this DVD twice now and both times I did feel that I got a good workout. You definitely work your arms in this DVD. Mine were sore the day after I did this one for the first time. I didn't feel it as much in my lower body as I would have liked.

My biggest complaint with this DVD and probably why I won't do it as much as my other DVDs is the timing...with the past contestants and the music. I know that in the other BL DVDs the contestants were not always in sync with each other and it never bothered me. But, on the other DVDs, there is at least one or two past contestants that were in great shape at that point and I tended to focus on them. In this one I try following Sionne but he's all the way in the back and with everyone so much on their own beats, it's really distracting. The moves don't seem to be in tune with the music at all. This doesn't bother everyone I know but I'm one that counts the beats so, for me, it really makes this seem like a mess. While I was halfway through my second time doing this DVD I decided to just mute the TV and played my own music and I liked it much better that way. If Jillian at least worked out with the contestants so we could follow her that would have made this a much better DVD in my opinion. It's just too all over the place for me which is unfortunate because I do feel I got a good calorie burn. But I think I'll stick with my other DVDs most days.

And as for the language, I actually never heard her use any inappropriate language the first time I did this DVD...not that I'm saying it's not there, I'm sure it is if others heard it. But it's obviously not that obvious because I didn't hear it. And the second time I muted halfway through so there you go! :)

All in all, if you don't mind everyone being off-timing and having to kind of just go at your own pace with no ""leader"" then you might really like this DVD.",1262217600,,2043,3.978048780487805

However, when I finished the workout I didn't feel like I had accomplished much.  There isn't much at all in terms of ab work either.

Jillian tells you how to do the move, but isn't doing it herself and the contestants just don't have it down.

Look to Trish's review for an indepth review of the layout of the video.

The lower body toning segment was actually pretty good - the contestants were more in line with each other and great moves (my lower body is what was sore).

I work up a huge sweat and get my heartrate up with that one every time. This supposedly aerobic circuit ""Last Chance Workout"" is much easier and I will do it on days when I'm not up to much of a challenge.

Her cuing has it's mistakes like most workout DVDs, but is generally good. What I like is that you can do reps at your own pace. She does not count them for you and just wants you to be moving. This allows me to concentrate on good form and not be too rushed. Unlike NMTZ where it can get pretty frantic.

Also, it is mostly standing work so you do not need to bounce back and forth from the floor to your feet like NMTZ. Again, simply not as frantic.

I enjoy her upper body toning moves in this one. But watch out for her stretching. I strained my back. She jumps out of deep stretching positions too quickly. Beware.

The menu does not allow you to customize your workout. You must do the prearranged workout options, or individual workouts only. You cannot pick and choose like the other Biggest Loser DVDs, in particular ""Weight Loss Yoga"" (which by the way I highly recommend!) So if I only have time for warmup and lower body, I just play all and skip through those I don't want to do. Kind of a nuisance and a menu flaw.

In a nutshell I do recommend this DVD as long as you aren't expecting an advanced, push you to your limits workout. If you own No More Trouble Zones this workout is a good alternative for your easier workout days. It is a solid, quick, total body workout.",1259884800,5,1658,4.20125786163522
3962576,5,B002OMIKLI,"I really enjoy the Biggest Loser, and always wanted to see what cardio circuit training was all about.  This DVD has my favorite contestants, workouts that are doable and of course Jillian!  I like how there are modifications for the workouts and the fact that no one is perfectly choreographed like some of the old ""Stepford leodtarded"" videos of the past.  This is what you would see in a class at the gym.  People working at there own level and using the best form they can manage at their fitness level!  Good solid workout, great fun!  What have YOU done to make YOURSELF feel proud?",1259884800,3,588,4.552380952380952
8376204,5,B002OMIKLI,"I bought this because I have every other Jillian DVD, and didn't want to miss one!  The main workout is super fun and effective, it combines moves with dumbbells, alternating with cardio intervals.  I do it with 8 or 10 lb dumbbells to step it up a bit!  The only thing it is missing is ab moves, but the main workout does incorporate quite a few plank variations, so the core is covered.  Give it a try if you are a Jillian fan!",1525132800,,429,4.132530120481928
8376205,2,B002OMIKLI,"This workout was okay. I just didn't like it as much as some of the other Biggest Loser tapes. First, some of the contestants working out on it were acting unprofessional. It seemed to be a poorly produced tape because the contestants seemed to be acting like it was a joke. Second, I did not care for the fact that Jillian did the whole tape. The character she plays on the Biggest Loser is very unappealing. I like her Jillian Michael's tapes but not her on the Biggest Loser. She seems to be more focused on putting on a show then working out or teaching proper form. I'd say skip this tape and get the Power X-Train or Power Sculpt of the Biggest Loser series.",1496966400,,664,4.32
