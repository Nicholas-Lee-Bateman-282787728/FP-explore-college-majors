The film opens on a scene so perfect it must be a miniature setting. The inn manager says there is a delay of the train - an avalanche. The hotel is filled. Miss Froy, a governess, is leaving. The people there are always singing, ""as happy as children"". [Believable?] There are comic scenes created by an over-crowded hotel. A man is singing and playing a guitar, then a pair of hands grab his neck! The next morning a package falls from a window and hits a young woman, Iris Henderson, who was standing next to Miss Froy. On the train Iris sits across from Miss Froy, and sleeps. When she awakes she find that lady had vanished! There is no record now of Miss Froy, no one admits to seeing her. She has disappeared into thin air on a moving train. A friendly doctor says it was a delusion caused by that blow to the head.

The train stops so a patient and her nurse can get aboard. Then a woman is found in the train compartment - but its not Miss Froy! The doctor says its her subconscious. But a scrap of paper from Miss Froy's tea carton shows Iris was right. Iris and her friend search the baggage car and find something. They figure out how Miss Froy was made to vanish. Iris deduces the conspiracy, but they are served drinks that were doped. But there are surprises that foil the conspiracy and rescue Miss Froy. But the conspirators have another plan. Their car is uncoupled and sent off on a siding. The small group of Englishmen hold off the foreign foe with pistol fire. A lawyer can't help them here. Their luck lets them escape down the line to the next country, and they return safely to England. Miss Froy meets them at the FO, where she is playing a tune that conceals a secret code.

This film is a witness that travelers in Europe before WW II were often armed with pistols; they could not depend on the Government. This story was re-filmed in the 1970s without any political censorship. I think it was the better version. There is another importance to this film. Many have wondered how a body that had wounds from shots from the front in Dallas could become a body wounded by shots from the rear in Bethesda. Switching JFK's body with a sacrificed double would change the direction of the shots. It would be a small price to pay for a successful assassination and a change in power.",1471564800,,2355,4.396788990825688

7905859,4,B00000DC90,"Having seen the 1938 Alfred Hitchcock movie several times, I thought it would be fun to read the book that inspired it. I was not disappointed. Although different in some place, it was a great read.",1363478400,,198,4.527777777777778
7905860,5,B00000DC90,"I think of this movie more as a romantic comedy than as a thriller.  Margaret Lockwood plays a rich heiress who is traveling back home to marry an unwanted husband.  On the train, she runs into a kindly nanny, Miss Froy (played by Dame May Whitty).  After sharing tea with Miss Froy, Lockwood retires for a nap.  When she awakes, she finds that Miss Froy has dissapeared, and no one on the train admits to ever seeing her.  Puzzled and worried, Lockwood grudgingly enlists the help of Micheal Redgrave, who plays a bohemian musician, in finding Miss Froy.  The chemistry between Redgrave and Lockwood is delicious.  They trade insults in between searching through the train.  (And, of course, they fall in love.)  Then the movie takes a rather unbelievable, but interesting turn as an international spy ring becomes involved.  I believe this version of the film contains a trailer and an introduction that have little to do with the film, but the picture and sound were decent.  The atmosphere is light, unlike later Hitchcock films.  A treat.",993168000,,1043,4.830508474576271
