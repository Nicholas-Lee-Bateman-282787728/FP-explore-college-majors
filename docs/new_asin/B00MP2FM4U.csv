Acting = Bad,
Production = Bad

I personally love the movie The Song, it is religious and the acting is really, really good.  This was just awful.  Please don't do it.  Skip this movie and watch The Song if you want a movie about love with religious undertones.",1486598400,2,403,4.115384615384615

6599162,2,B00MP2FM4U,"One of the slooooowest movies I've seen with wooden acting from some of the lesser characters.  The plot is obvious.  Because of the look-alike plot device, sometimes it's hard to figure out which person is in the scene at first--the not-so-great-boyfriend or the rich inventor.  That's annoying.

What's in the description doesn't start until over 2/3 of the movie has passed.  Most of the movie is a slooooooow development of a going-nowhere relationship.  Then add in a misunderstanding that allows the heroine to meet ""Mr. Right"" without realizing it.  Then the movie gets weird and preachy.  It starts lecturing about spirits and demons and ghosts...and I hate when Christian movies preach some message at the viewers.  It's like the rest of the story is an excuse to preach some idea.

Then the cute/predictable ending. Although, (SPOILER!!!)

...come to think of it, it's actually a little creepy to marry your dead boyfriend's twin brother.

Two stars for the potential some of the ideas had, though they weren't carried out well here.  The ""cheating on you with you"" and secretly-twins having two dates at the same time in the same place and the mishaps that could ensue ideas were good.

Not to mention it is rare that twins are separated in adoption.  Most hopeful adoptive parents are thrilled to adopt twins, and most expectant parents understand it's best for twins to stay together.  I can't say it never happens, but it's extremely rare--and usually the adoptive parents are told they are adopting one of a set of twins.",1482796800,,1536,4.94140625

6599206,1,B00MP2FM4U,"I almost never write a review because it's so subjective, but this movie was just so bad in so many ways I wanted to write something.

Right off the bat, the acting was horrible. I've seen high school performances where the students did a better job then these actors. It was bad from the start straight through the end, and it was most of the actors including some of the main characters. I might see if there is another movie after this that the main characters are in just to see if their acting improved or it was the directing or some other influence that made them so bad in this film.

The story line was so-so and it was pretty goofy how the only way this could have come possibly occurred is for 1000 things went the way they needed at the right times.  The heavy religious aspect that got thicker and thicker as the story went on was a real turn-off. I guess if you are a very religious you might be nodding in agreement, but if you aren't, it seems as if this was more a promo for following Jesus vs watching an entertaining story.

I wanted to stop watching but I like to watch things to the end and in this case, it was so I was able to write a poor review without someone suggesting it got better.  Don't watch this movie!",1469836800,,1236,4.198312236286919

Just way too off topic for the movie up to that point, and not nearly enough theological explanation for including that kind of subject matter. Honestly, it was just really, really awful.

Being a low budget movie, the acting is a little on the flat side, probably because of the stars lack of experience.  (Although I have to say they are charming and believable.)  However, the storyline is great and the Christian values up lifting, without being judgmental.  This is a love story of sinners finding grace in Christ and finding love through faith.

6599254,4,B00MP2FM4U,"I applaud the creators of this film who did everything from writing to acting and directing. That takes guts and the end result, while not amazing, was worth the watching and engaging enough to hold an audience's attention. Yes, some of the acting was a bit lacking, although the main character, Jessica, has some serious acting potential and pulled off the leading role well. The story line was creative and again had some real potential for a great plot but became a little convoluted in a few places. I really appreciate the Christian values, but it could have been more effective if it were just a little more subtle in places and tighter in the construction/direction. The filming was well done. If they tightened up the spaces in conversation, develop a little more depth in the romantic relationship and let the acting flow a little more realistically it would have been 5 stars. For a ""B"" movie, I was not disappointed. I hope this group produces more.",1449273600,3,960,4.754491017964072

6599257,2,B00MP2FM4U,"I don't even have the words to express how I feel about this film. I love good valued christian films.  I don't worry about B film acting, low budget issues when the movie has a great message and leaves you happy, deep in thought, uplifted, or spiritually rejuvenated.  ""2 to Tangle"" was NOT any of these.

The first 1h 19m was great.  It was good seeing a young woman sticking to her values.  The whole concept of there being 2 men that look alike could have been good.  Like I said, could have been.

I don't know what sect the film makers are, I don't really care as long as they are teaching good doctrine.  However, this movie turned into a low budget horror film for five minutes.  Creepy, fearful music started playing and the preacher started talking about how Jessica (the main character) is seeing an apparition of an evil spirit.  He then brought her home to cast the evil away from her.  I believe there are evil spirits in this world, but this was a romance turned scary!

After the scary five minutes, the movie turned into a lame attempt to show how God is good.  The last 20 minutes several sub plots made their way into the film.  Although abortion, adoption, miracles, healing of hearts, God working mysteries are all great movie topics, they were all just randomly thrown in so that the movie could cover as many Christian topics possible.  I only gave this two stars, because I didn't turn it off before it was done.  This movie was terrible!",1449014400,13,1462,4.481060606060606

My spiritual leaders would never have reacted or given me that kind of ""advice"".  If this is suppose to be a christian movie, those scenes actually made a mockery of any religion.  If anything, the friends should have reacted in that manner and the pastor (+ wife) in the manner that the friends advised.  2. The storyline is blown apart by the the end of the movie.  I did not walk away more uplifted or spiritually stronger. Rather very disappointed in the director's/creator's misguided reality.
