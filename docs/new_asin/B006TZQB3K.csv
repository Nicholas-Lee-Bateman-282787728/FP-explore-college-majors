8504273,5,B006TZQB3K,"Very Pleased. Jungle Junction is on Disney Junior TV and the Grand Kids like it a lot.  It is only available on Non-USA format DVD's so we bought an ALL Region DVD player to be able to play this and other Disney DVD's not available for play in the US.  Is a Great show and only wish that there were more DVD's available in this series.  Recommend it highly to Parents / Grand Parents with young Children.

8504275,3,B006TZQB3K,My 2 year old loves this show. We bought this to take along on a trip to Vegas. I think the description could be a little clearer though. I was under the impression that I was getting the season and not a few episodes. (I still would've bought it just wouldn't have been as disappointed. ) other than that it's great but 2 stars go to misinformation,1387584000,2,349,4.223880597014926
