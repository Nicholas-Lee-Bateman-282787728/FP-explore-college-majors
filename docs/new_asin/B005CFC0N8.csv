4652896,2,B005CFC0N8,"Echo Bridge has once again provided us with a budget movie pack and this time it contains some of the worst Halloween sequels ever made. Halloween 6 is easily the best in this collection, with a high body count and some good gore-NOTE: Halloween 6 suffers from the same audio problems that plagued both the Hellraiser and other disc sets. I have no idea how Echo bridge manages to do this to at least one title on EVERY set they release. So be forewarned that ALL of the SFX and music tracks have a weird sort of echo on them throughout the whole picture (and if your looking for the ""producer's cut"" with the additional footage-it's not here).

H20 and Resurrection look and sound good enough for what they are. H20 has the distinction of bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis, but it feels more like a Scream movie than a Halloween sequel. Halloween Resurrection on the other hand may be as bad (if not worse) than the Rob Zombie crapfests that followed. Busta Ryhmes is easily the most obnoxious character that ever graced the screen in a Halloween vehicle, and seems incapable of delivering his dialogue through most of the picture.

All in all, this is a pretty sorry excuse of a collection, since the best of the batch has audio issues and the other movies are basically dollar bin dribble. If you must own these movies, I'd recommend tracking down the original Halloween Triple Pack that came out in 2009 which has all the films in pristine quality. Still I can't complain too much about this set - I only spent 5 bucks on it.",1334793600,2,1526,4.52536231884058

4652906,5,B005CFC0N8,Okay now a lot of people are having trouble finding the curse it's on the bottom of the DVD plus these movies are some of the best ones except for the last one with busta rymes now i saw that 2 at the movies but i didn't care for it because they killed off the scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis now that is unforgivable so if your looking for a cheaper way to own these movies instead of buying them separate than get this,1435363200,,418,3.988095238095238

4652925,5,B005CFC0N8,"To tell you the truth, I only liked Halloween Resurrection. Why? Well, it has the late great Donald Pleasance(RIP),
who was also in Halloween 1,2 4, and 5. This film reveals Michael Myers secrets, why he kills, and who is controlling
him. The other 2 Halloween film are alright, nothing to write home about.",1385337600,2,307,4.703703703703703

The audio on the movies is dolby 2.0 only, but the sound is very clear.  I got this set because it was cheaper than buying the movies individually.  There is no extras or anything, not even subtitles.

4652934,5,B005CFC0N8,"You can't go wrong buying something that John Carpenter had a hand in espically the first when he had the idea and the know how and turned it into a classic and fierce series of Halloween flicks.
