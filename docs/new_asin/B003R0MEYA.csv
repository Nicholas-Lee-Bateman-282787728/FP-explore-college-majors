4174883,1,B003R0MEYA,"Like many, I was a big fan of this show.  Season One was pretty good and held a lot of promise.  Season Two started off good enough but ended with a really bad cliff hanger that left three main characters dead and two more in serious jeopardy.  And guess what?  ABC cancelled the show.

If you have not seen Season Two yet, be warned, if you are a fan of the show and buy this DVD, you are headed for a big let down.  This is exactly why I don't watch network television.  As viewers we find shows we like, get invested in the story line, and then the show gets canned and all those characters you like whose stories you got invested in are left in limbo with no closure.  Thanks for watching our network!  I should have known better than to allow myself to get involved with a show on network television.

I guess the show wasn't ""real"" enough for some people.  Sad.",1305590400,65,867,4.193939393939394
4174884,5,B003R0MEYA,"This is a wonderful series. The writers and the producers are beyond reproach with putting this series together. the actors are well beyond profetionalism and really bring you into the story. the series has not been canceled as of yet but only delayed acording to ABC. There aren't very many SCI FI action dramas out there and right now ABC basicly has a huge fan base to pool from. if they actually cancel this show it would set ABC back with all the other bland progaming the other networks have at the moment.

I hope this series goes on for many more seasons and my hats off to all the wonderful hard working men and women who make V the Series what it is.

Edit:7/18/2011  Now that the show is officially canceled i absolutely refuse to support ABC nor will i watch any of their programming. The executives appear too be mindless bafoons that would not know good programming if it hit them in there butts. mabie they should run as politicians .... they will fit in with all the other brain dead politicians!!!!!",1305590400,44,1016,4.510869565217392
4174885,5,B003R0MEYA,"Since the new version of V has been cancelled, the 2nd and final season is coming out on DVD.  Here it is on DVD...to see Ryan's child grow up, and also to see Diana, the original Diana from the original series come back to create the ""cat and mouse"" game that she craves against her daughter Anna and to use her granddaughter Lisa against Anna.  Now since the series has been cancelled, we will not get to see the outcome of the fallout from this season.

Also, to catch up on the whole phenomenon, you can read all 16 books of V starting with one that started it all ""V"" by A C Crispin.  Also you can get the miniseries on DVD and the Final Battle on DVD as well as the 19 episode complete original series on DVD that came out in 2004.  There is another book that takes place 20 years later that is called ""V:  The 2nd Generation"" that takes place after the first invasion.

In the final episode of this DVD, you will hear inklings of the original series come back by the sentence of ""they were here before"".",1305504000,2,1010,4.2020725388601035
4174886,1,B003R0MEYA,"Season 2 ends with a huge cliff hanger that is an absolute embarrassment to ABC and it's writers. There is no season 3, the show was cancelled. They royally screwed us over, and please do not give them your money. Please don't buy this horrible show of respect to loyal fans of a once great franchise.",1305504000,28,301,4.392857142857143

I PERSONALLY THINK THIS IS THE BEST VERSION MADE AND OF COURSE ONLY VERSION MADE. I HOPE THEY MAKE A 3RD SEASON IF THEY DON'T THEY ARE MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. I HAVE SEEN ALL SERIES ON TELEVISION AND HAVE THE FIRST SERIES ON DVD. I HOPE THEY RELEASE THE 2ND ONE SOON, SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WAITING. WHY NOT RELEASE PEOPLE WANT TO BUY IT, WOULD YOU NOT HAVE PEOPLE BUT IT LEGALLY THEN DOWNLOAD IT ILLEGALLY. BUT AWESOME TV-SERIES",1303516800,3,550,4.149532710280374
4174888,5,B003R0MEYA,"The original ""V"" mini-series and ""V: The Final Battle"" were ground breaking, riveting dramas that were essentially a play on the history of the Nazi party and it's rise to power.  The original ""V"" was one of the most watched mini-series of the 1980's and won international acclaim for it's powerful story and strong performances.  The 1980's TV series spin-off that followed did not come even remotely close to living up to either mini-series.  The show started with an interesting idea but was destroyed by poor writing, low budgets and uninspired direction and was inevitably cancelled.  Toward the end, the only thing the original TV series had going for it was the performance of the always exceptional Jane Badler as evil lizard overlord, Diana.

Season 1 of ""V"", the remake, updated the original 1980's mini-series for a new century while maintaining the promise of the original by adapting the story to fit into a world more concerned with international terrorism than space-Nazi's.

The new ""V"" was not an exact copy, it was a re-imagining - which was good, because fans of the original could enjoy something they loved and still be surprised and shocked hand in hand with those new to ""V"".

The first season of the new ""V"" was very much about a show finding its feet and a cast finding their characters, but despite those ups and downs an excellent product emerged that resonated with a decent enough audience to get the show a second year despite some unwise network decisions that almost killed it after it's highly rated premier.

When season 2 hit, it hit with a bang!  The writers still seemed to be struggling with the whole ""show don't ""tell"" concept that every writer is taught to obey, because exposition is rife throughout most episodes, but with the season now concluded you can see why the exposition was necessary - the writers and producers only had ten hours of television to tell a very complicated story in and try and gain a third year for the fans.

Season 2's most welcome surprise was the introduction of lizard Queen Anna's mother, Diana, played to perfection by the original series' Jane Badler.  Though Jane played a character with the same name over 20 years ago, this Diana was not the same Diana audiences loved to hate in the 1980's.  This Diana was a Queen in exile playing cat and mouse with her own daughter.  The dynamic between both actresses was electrifying and you frequently felt Anna had met her match.  While the humans stumbled around trying to figure out how to save humanity from a vastly superior alien force, Diana tormented her daughter, creating doubt and sewing division with the raise of an eyebrow and a carefully planted suggestion.

In addition to Jane's highly publicized return, season 2 also gave audiences a great many twists and turns, including:
- the return of Mark Singer, the original series' Mike Donovan;
- an international resistance that finally started to do something other than debate the need to take action;
- technology versus the power of the human soul;
- Visitors without their human skin;
- critter eating in all its disgusting iconicness;
- Erica Evans finding her inner bad ass;
- the death of half the cast, and...
- we learned the Visitors were like a race of genetic locusts in search of perfection in an attempt to save their race.

If season 1 was good, season 2 was excellent.  Yes, it has it's short falls like any young series, but in a remarkably short time the series found it's feet and created a drama that was exciting and surprising.  With outstanding performances from actors like Elizabeth Mitchell, Morena Baccarin, Joel Gretsch, Scott Wolf, Morris Chestnut, Laura Vandervoort, Charles Measure, Christopher Shyer, Josh Hildreth and Jane Badler, season 2 was a lot of fun and incredibly easy to watch and get lost in.  If the powers that be give fans a season 3, those actors that survive the shocking episode 10 cull can be counted on to give audiences an even better new season, because they're just that damn good at their jobs.

We can only hope the series is renewed for a third year because this show, more than many that have already been renewed as of the end of April 2011, deserves a little more time to grow and continue to wow audiences with promising story lines and brilliantly conceived characters.",1303344000,117,4314,4.780619111709287
4174889,5,B003R0MEYA,"V Season 2 is a giant improvement over the first season. The season premiere picks up where the first season finale left off...the red sky. We start to learn a lot more about the V's this season including exactly what they look like under their human skin. This season also marks the return of Jane Badler from the original as Diana. She plays the mother of Anna and the scenes between them are awesome. Mark Salling from the original V also appears in the finale, leaving his role open for season 3. The show is a lot more interesting this season with betrayals, shocking deaths, twists, new characters and more. If you thought the first season was okay, you are sure to like this season.",1303171200,43,689,4.52
4174890,5,B003R0MEYA,"I have always been a big fan of V since it premiered back in the 80's.  I was thrilled to see them remaking it.  The first season was terrific.  The only problem i have with this is that it is very different from the original series.  For example, V- the first season said that when anna found out about the hybrid baby she said she thought it wasn't possible and in the beginning of season 2(which they brought back diana, which is great) diana also thought it wasn't possible for humans and
Vs to have a baby.  That didn't make sense because in the original series, it was diana that had the V(Brian)to sleep with Robin Maxwell, which produced ""elizabeth"".  That's just one example.  But this series is still really great.  I was thrilled to see Marc Singer at the season 2 finale.  He said he was leader of project aries to save humanity.  It was neat to see that Erica's bosses, who acted like they were trying to destroy her, which turns out they were just making sure she could be trusted to join project aries.  I just wish that Marc singer would have come back as ""mike dovovan"" instead of ""Lars""  I hope how season 2 ended isn't as it seems. Don't want to give too much away.  It would be great if they brought back Faye Grant ""julie parish"", Frank Ashmore ""philip"", Jennifer Cook ""elizabeth"".  I can't wait for season 3 to premiere.  I would recommend this series to anyone who loved the original or who had never seen it.  A Must See!  5 stars.",1302048000,16,1455,4.369402985074627

Spectacular story and character development, well acted, and casting was exceptional.  I enjoyed the original ""V"" series but never gave it much of a thought afterwards.  Not so here, this updated version is much more cerebral. The ending was not quite what I expected and left me just staring at the screen - Wow.  Courageous writing for a series. Strangely, with all that going for it, the show only lasted two seasons. In retrospect, the entire story was made more powerful by the finale and its short life - an additional season might have trivialized the entire effort.  The sets and special effects were perfect - you really buy into the concept.  There was a goofy subplot about the soul, but the overarching story was excellent.

4175201,3,B003R0MEYA,"Are serialized, big budget shows on TV dead?  We'll find out in the next couple of weeks when two more of them debut on TV.  But it looks like the trend is dying, and the latest casualty was ABC's remake of the alien invasion drama V.  The 10 episode second season would also prove to be the last.

The season opened resolving the climax of the first season.  Anna (Morena Baccarin), the duplicitous leader of the V's (short for Visitors) has unleashed Red Sky on the Earth.  This is the first time she's showed a hint of her true colors (pun intended) to the humans, most of whom still love her.  Is this a wakeup call, or will she smooth things over so most people trust her again?

It would be nice if more humans understand the danger they were in.  Very few humans are working to figure out how to fight the invasion.  The show focuses on a small group in New York City lead by FBI agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell).  Among her allies are Father Jack Landry (Joel Gretsch) and freelance terrorist/soldier for hire Kyle Hobbes (Charles Mesure).  Ryan Nichols (Morris Chestnut), a V who has rebelled against Anna, used to be part of the group, but with Anna holding on to his new born daughter, where does his loyalty lie?  Similarly, news reporter Chad Decker (Scott Wolf) appears to be thinking his initial enthusiasm for the V's was incorrect.  Can the resistance trust him?

The biggest divided loyalty goes to Lisa (Laura Vandervoort), Anna's daughter.  Through her assignment to make Erica's son Tyler (Logan Huffman) fall in love with her, she begins to embrace humanity.  Will she prove to be the biggest ally the resistance has?  And what will she make of discovering her grandmother Diana (original mini-series star Jane Badler) being held prisoner on the ship?

Have you gotten the idea that the show is complex yet?  There are lots of characters and stories, but I felt the writers did a fairly good job of balancing everything.  At times, it did make things feel a little slow, but most of the time, I was hooked in what was happening.

One thing to keep in mind is that this was very much a character driven show.  Those looking for non-stop action were sure to be disappointed.  Instead, we explored what the actions they were taking were doing to the characters.  This was partially reflected in some romantic entanglements that showed up late in the season, although that was one thing I didn't care much for.  There were enough things going on already, and it just felt forced.

However, we did get plenty of intrigue as the resistance characters attempted to take down the V's.  There were lots of close calls and tense moments.

And the special effects were always outstanding.  I could never fault them on that front.

Which brings up another issue with this season, the increase of graphic violence.  Maybe this was a way they were hoping to increase ratings, but every episode had at least one scene that featured more blood than was necessary.  Yeah, it might be realistic, but I don't need realism to enjoy my TV shows.  In fact, I appreciate it when the violence is understated.

Anyway, the acting seemed fine to me.  Lots of people seem to want to attack Logan Huffman, and I'll admit his acting was on the weak side.  However, I didn't think it was that bad.  Meanwhile, Elizabeth Mitchell and Morena Baccarin are amazing as the leads.  These two outshone the rest of the cast every week as their characters led the various sides.

Then there's the ending.  Yes, the show was canceled after the ending was filmed.  However, it was obvious to everyone with a brain that the show wasn't going to get a season 3.  Heck, the episode order for this season was cut early in production down to 10 episodes.  If that's not a sign the end is coming, I don't know what is.  But the writers didn't head the writing on the wall and left us with a major cliffhanger.  And it was very dark.  I'd love to see what happens next, but that will never happen.  As a result of that, I wouldn't start the show.  But then again, I hate to start something when I know I'll never know the outcome.

Despite the fact that the show was canceled, we do get some extras, including deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two featurettes on the character development over the course of the show and how the visuals were done on a TV budget.  Something about how they would have moved the story forward/concluded it would have made this set something I would rush out to buy instead of something I'm not super excited about.

So, because of the cliffhanger ending and the increased violence, I'm torn on the second season of V.  It had some good characters and compelling moments, but I'm not sure it was worth watching in the end.",1432425600,,4730,4.555819477434679

4175247,5,B003R0MEYA,"Yet again, the network bean-counters have axed another cracking sci-fi series, so V has joined the ranks of Firefly, the 4400, The Event, the recently deceased SGU et al. Season two immediately follows the season one finale and gets straight down to business. Anna continues to be the very epitome of duplicitous, the disparate 5th column continues fighting a losing battle and the drippy peace ambassadors continue spreading sweetness and light.

As Anna's plans for humanity become evident there seems nothing to stop her but the ineffectual, morally conflicted and counter-productive efforts of the 5th column and it all could have got a bit samey but for the introduction of Jane Badler as the former queen (from the original series - nice touch) where after the plot thickens a bit and twists about in a fairly satisfactory manner. It all gets rather silly at times (especially science boy's daft contributions - they should have drafted in Walter Bishop from Fringe division, that would have been fun) but it is all jolly entertaining and engaging.

However, with only ten forty-odd minute episodes in the series it all feels a little rushed with little room for character and sub-plot development. It is clear that there should have been another series; this one ends with more loose ends than it started with and knowing that it has cancelled leaves the usual feelings of disappointment and of having been cheated. It would have been better if the writers & cast had known that the show was for the chop well before the last episode and then perhaps there would have been some sort of satisfactory conclusion. Mind you, it's all very Zen as the original 1980's series was axed too so this is a remake in both senses.",1421280000,,1724,4.860544217687075
4175248,5,B003R0MEYA,A great remake on a great science-fiction show from the 80s. I love the way they incorporated little things from the 80s show but still made it a new show all on its own. Disappointing that there's only two seasons but the two seasons they gave us were fantastic and kept my attention.

4175269,3,B003R0MEYA,"It's easy to understand why this series was cancelled.  What's not easy to understand is why it was ever green-lighted to begin with.

Two-dimensional characters struggling with predictable dilemmas in predictable ways, the only interesting part of this series is its depiction of how easily mass media can be manipulated to tell any narrative elites which to tell.  While the series does dwell, occasionally, on 'deep' questions such as the nature of the soul and what makes a human human, it does so in a predictably turgid fashion.  In fact, the way most of the topics and subplots (especially the modified Lear-like relationship between Anna and her daughter, Lisa) are handled throughout this series can be described as 'predictably turgid.'

Additionally, watching this series requires a suspension of disbelief it's sometimes difficult to pull off given the large number of improbable plot twists and plot devices sprinkled through every episode.  For example: The Vs possess unimagined technology, yet can't seem to implement an effective surveillance system on their mother ship which would track who last entered a room--and there are conveniently no cameras in Anna's private chambers (including one compartment which plays a pivotal role toward the end of season one).

It's safe to give this series a miss.",1420070400,,1319,5.282296650717703

How is one supposed to reconcile 'the shock of seeing aliens in the first episode, for the first time ever' with 'Diana appearing in the second season talking about being on Earth for years'? None of the old-timers remembers an alien invasion or red dust from 27 years ago?

4175389,4,B003R0MEYA,Def. enjoyed Season of this series & it arrived very quickly ... Very happy with my purchase but i wish there was a Season 3 !,1394150400,,126,3.8846153846153846
4175390,3,B003R0MEYA,"Honestly I was a bit conflicted on purchasing both season one and 2 but as I grew up in the 80s loving this show, I felt I owed it to my self to ""see it through"". And while I do not regret that I saw both seasons, I do regret that I had to pay money to do it. Why? Because as entertaining as this series is, the writing is just.... awful. Don't get me wrong, the acting and character development is good stuff, but the technical and story plot holes get really annoying. Most of it is stuff that an ignorant spoon fed moron would not notice, but if you are a steeped sci fi fan, your going to pick up on it pretty quick. Just a few examples.....
1: where was the massive air battle when the ships first arrived? I cannot believe for a second that the ships were not attacked as soon as they broke into earth space.
2: The v nor the government do not track or trace a single cell phone call..... ever.
3: hololythic projection computers and a myriad of other technologies are presented with zero amazement or comment from the cast.
4: almost nothing is shown of the v gifts when they are presented. We never see how the desserts are changed, how any of the ""global warming"" is fixed, basically nothing other than a few skin repairs.
5: we never see the shuttles do any thing but dock, and one get blown up. That's about it.
6: The live aboards are promised an insite into the v culture, religion, recreation, and what not. Each mother ship appears to be a massive mobile space city but we never see any of it except a few halls and rooms. not even the bridge of the ships is ever shown. Huge mess up in my opinion.
7: I cannot believe for a second that world leaders would have zero comment on aliens coming to earth. Sure it's talked about but you never see them say anything. This takes place under Obama as president after all and he comments on every thing!
8: some of the character development is way off. For example, say your a single parent of a child and you know for a fact that there new playmate is a skin cased lizard.... how are you ever ok with then hanging out?
9: if human cloned skin is basically a garment... why does skinning them kill them? Sure I can see some pain as they are bonded to the skin but ultimately it's just a shell. Another plot device not revealed and left to the imagination.
10: My biggest pet peeve of all... it stands to reason that we would call them visitors, though it's clear pretty early they do not intend to leave.... But why do they call themselves visitors? We never find out what they call themselves, never hear a snatch of their own language, are never introduced to any of their culture other than that they just love our DNA! Hell, other than a rat, we never see them eat any thing that typical humans wouldn't eat.
All in all, I believe what killed this show was a lack of fleshing of the primary character, the visitors themselves. The human characters were fleshed to death, leaving nothing for the v cast. The plot lines for them were old and trite, made so by a zero insite into their personal motivations. I soooooooooooo wanted this show to be good, and I suppose for a brain switch off, and just chilling, it was ok. But the fact that this show failed gives me some hope for humanity, in that our entertainment standards haven't slipped so far as to give this crap a pass.
My advice.... if you are patient, it will at some point be free on Amazon. Add it to your watch list and back away from the computer or kindle. Do not be tempted to hit the purchase button, because for this ride it costs about 50 bucks for both seasons and by the time you are done, the only part you will regret is that you paid 50 bucks.",1393632000,2,3674,4.242510699001427

The only possible answer to why Season 3 was canceled might be because, from what I be hearing from conspiracy theorist like former MN Gov. Jessie Ventura is that, we might have Reptilian aliens living amongst us; some working at ABC and some working in the White House. V is a ""too well made"" portrait of the ""Reptilian alien agenda"" so Season 3 had to be canceled.

4175447,2,B003R0MEYA,"I loved the original 'V' mini-series from the 1980's!

Sure,it didn't have a big fancy-shmancy multimillion dollar budget and didn't have an all-star cast; but 'V' rocked and still holds up some 30 years later! Dude, I was so excited that ABC television was going to do a reboot/remake of the old iconic series!

However, this updated version is nowhere as near as fun or exciting as the original series from the '80's. In the original 'V' television mini-series, there was an actual war going on! There was battles against the ""visitors"" over land and sea,in the streets, in parking lots,on city rooftops,in hospitals,on horseback, and on country-sides. It really felt like a epic struggle against an invading alien force that's deeply imbedded with our political and social structure!

Sadly, V:THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is just a bunch of endless talk with very little action. With the advancement of special effects nowadays, when compared to the original series, I was totally looking for epic battles and to see beloved cast members to die off heroically defending earth from the ""visitors"" every single episode. Unfortunately, for me, a single solitary episode of this second season felt like hours of my life had gone by and I was getting ever closer and closer to my first social security check; even though I'm only 36 years away from being eligible.

Come to think of it, the story-telling of this second (and final season) of 'V' kept on reminding me and reminding me of another ABC t.v. show, LOST. LOST wasted an obscene amount of screen time with building up the show's likeable and memorable characters but then turned around and ruined it all with a lot of endless talking and island walking that never ever went anywhere. 'V:THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON' is just more of the same. I actually kept falling asleep on a lot of the episodes because there was just all this endless talking. Please hang onto this series if you suffer from insomnia because it's way cheaper than sleeping pills.

Surprisingly,I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever with the casting. Although, there should have really been at least a dozen 5TH COLUMN fighters. Okay, we had the main four protagonists:the mercenary, the F.B.I. agent, the priest, and the ""visitor"" whose now on our side fighting for our Earth. Yet, there should have been more minor 5TH COLUMN characters dying alongside the pivotal four as the series went on. Each death could and should have inspired the 5TH COLUMN to more action and to be involved in more fire-fights/missions. At least it would have been something!

Again, it's the painfully dialogue-heavy writing, the horrifically slow pacing, and the total absence of actual action in a tale about insidious global occupation that robs this show of having a continued place in my DVD collection!

After watching the first season of this rebooted version, I was very curious and wanted to see where this second season was headed. It cost me $16, a trip to my  local mailbox service, and 12 hours of my life, and 7 recharges on my portable DVD player.

A shame that AMAZON.COM doesn't have customer support resolutions option for that.",1375142400,2,3156,4.928436911487759
4175448,5,B003R0MEYA,Very good series especially if you liked the original series. So sad it got cancelled right when it was really getting good.,1371772800,,124,4.681818181818182
4175459,5,B003R0MEYA,"I can't believe they ended the this on season 2, it was so great, even better than the original. I hope they reconsider.",1370304000,,120,4.260869565217392
4175460,3,B003R0MEYA,"In my opinion, this version of V was no match for the 1983-1984 version. The new series is twice as long, and less happened between fewer characters. The show can hold your attention, but when each episode was over, I found myself thinking: ""I spent an hour on this?""

Most of the story seemed to be told among 4 or 5 resistance fighters huddled in a basement hideout than in scenes that showed much of the population at large. One reason for the so-so rating is how many hours of viewing time it takes for so little story. Sometimes shorter is better.

This version had graphic violence that didn't contribute to the story. Most of this was V-lizards biting each other (and people when they felt like it) on the neck with their 100 plus needle like teeth that were reminiscent of teeth in a barracuda or in the evil clown in Stephen King's ""It"". It doesn't make sense that the lizards would bite others to kill them, when they have immolation guns and other sophisticated weapons that don't require struggling in close quarters.

The lizard hidden under human skin in the new V's had an unrealistic anatomy. The multiple rows of long V-lizard needle teeth take up so much of their head that the area remaining for a brain was maybe 1/4 the size of a human brain at best. This is not consistent with the V's technical development. The old version V-lizard was more believable, even if the effects were 1980's.

There wasn't mouse eating, but a rat and a deer were on the menu. People are not on the menu in the new version, but the lizards eat their partner after mating. The lizard queen also uses her teeth to take a bite out of who she thinks are perpetrators of crime or sedition. The V-lizards are after human DNA to enhance their own through inter-breeding with humans, then plan to destroy the human race after they get what they want.

There is a mystical telepathic mind control called ""bliss"" that Anna, the Lizard Queen uses to control her fellow lizards and some people. However, this does not add to the story, and seems an overly simplistic way of showing how she controls her subjects, and its mechanism for addiction and mind control isn't explained.

Promising sub-plots like using potential biological agents against the V's are introduced, but then are either just dropped, are not adequately followed up, or are foiled due to lack of foresight, leaving the show too simplistic for the amount of one's time it takes to watch.

All to often, we're back to seeing leaders of the 5th Column resistance network in their basement hideout, wondering what to do next. None of them seem to have much attention to detail, so the evil V lizard queen Anna can easily foil their plans.

The story also relies heavily on what a few 5th Column leaders say is happening to the population at large, but other scenes don't adequately support it. For example, in season 1, the leaders say the Visitors are gaining the ""devotion"" of people all over the world, but this is conveyed only in conversations between the lead characters, and is not fleshed out much in other less often seen characters or extras.

Some footage for characters in foreign cities looked two dimensional, as though just a few actors were in front of a rear projection screen of background buildings. The foreground and background lighting just didn't seem to match, and it was distracting as a result. Sort of a low budget look. The floors some people were standing on in the space ship didn't look real either.

A certain scene of a shuttle arriving at the mother ship seemed be used over and over again. There were also some props, including those for oddly positioned bodies, that seemed to show up so often they might as well have been given names. As far as tech, the new V's have flying fragmentation devices and Immolation suicide pills, but the former is reminiscent of disintegrating aliens in the 1967 TV series ""The Invaders"".

The female V-lizards also have long tails, but the strength of the tail (the thin tail could lift the V's own weight up to over the V's head) didn't seem realistic. The female lizards were able to casually run a person through or otherwise quickly dispatch them with their tails, but in the story, the she-lizards would conveniently forget that they had this capability, so they;d fail to turn on their pursuers and use their tails when being pursued by the main characters.

The series was slow and plodding (and often boring) due to frequent emphasis on the emotional baggage of some characters. I'm not sure why this baggage stuff got to be the norm for scripts over the last couple of decades, since it doubles the length of time it takes to tell a given story. These are fictional characters after all, and the copious time it takes to watch the emotional baggage of characters on TV would better be spent interacting with real people in the real world.

In this series, it was also fairly predictable when a character was going to get knocked off, and how it was going to happen. The same predictability was true of when a character would betray the others.  There is a lot of hostage taking to manipulate characters, and the resistance against the V's is more like small scale terrorism than organized world wide freedom fighting.  This aspect is reminiscent of the movie ""Red Dawn"", but is not as well done as in Red Dawn.

The ending was very ambiguous and probably the worst part of the story. Way too many loose ends. For example, humans had just become susceptible to lizard bliss, lizard queen Anna was for the first time smiling a smile of joy and showing emotion rather than a cold and sinister smile, and it was hard to tell if the swarm of V ships were coming or going in the final scene.

Ideally, this V series would have made a follow up 2-hour show to tie up loose ends.  Even if the follow up never aired and was sold only on DVD and on demand, it would make the series seem complete, and tie up the loose ends, much like the movie ""Ark of Truth"" tied up loose ends after the end of the Stargate SG-1 series.

Fortunately, there were two areas where the plot of V was interesting or promising:

One was how Diana (the lizard queen from the original series, who was imprisoned by her daughter Anna, the lizard queen in the new series) seemed to understand what the human soul was, but Anna was totally clueless, thinking that the soul was something that could be removed surgically, while leaving the human being alive and intact. Some reviews said that the Diana in this series is not the Diana in the previous series, but it seems clear that she is the same Diana, because she discussed having cut short a previous invasion of earth.

Anna was equally clueless when talking to priests. One disappointing part was that the story shows the leadership of the Catholic church caving to Anna's intimidation in a matter of hours, portraying the priests as not even considering how God might fit into the situation, or even consulting Him in prayer for that matter. This could have been more interesting if the writers had better insight into such things.

The other promising area was the possibility that Diana (who wanted peace with the human race in the new series) could return to power and forge peaceful coexistence with the human race. This was only briefly visited, and the story cut off this avenue for Diana.

If Diana had been left in the story, the vast, unexplored subject of making and keeping the peace between V's and humans in a ""post war"" situation (one analogous to many real world situations) could have been explored in subsequent seasons.  This would have let the V series evolve into something that could be taken seriously. (Maybe it still could, if Diana can be salvaged via high tech medicine like one of the medical doctors who had presumably been killed was.)

Much of the acting seemed flat, but a notable and consistent exception was the superb acting by Morena Baccarin, who plays the evil lizard Queen Anna. She put on such a strong performance that she became the Lizard Queen one loved to hate. It reminded me of the powerful performance by Richard Crenna as the ruthless Colonel Skimmerhorn in the 1970's TV series ""Centennial"", where he was the Colonel one loved to hate.

In V, Anna runs the gamut from calmly saying she will eviscerate some of her enemies, or ""my eggs need nourishment"" (before predictably having her mate for lunch), to screaming in grief over a loss of eggs, to rehearsing how to cry crocodile tears (good term for a lizard!) to manipulate a widow. There is some really good acting there. Too bad the rest of the series didn't measure up. I'd have rated it higher if it wasn't as long compared to its story content.",1369872000,8,8701,4.622812702527543

At least the DVD gives you the option to stop the movie and back it up to replay what you missed. When you watch the cut seans the volume was very low.

4175467,3,B003R0MEYA,"The first season was about right, moving along fast enough to keep you interested while not too slowly or quickly to either leave things out or skim over important logical connections. The second season dragged. I accidentally watched the last episode for S2 and I thought I had actually watched the season 2 premier. Everything you needed to know was in that last season. It was like it picked up right off the last season of season 1. I can't imagine watching all of the other episodes in between. Here's why:

First, season 1 built up the premise that yeah, humans are stupid and politically and emotionally motivated morons who allow their saviors (the V) to infiltrate and amass a virtual gestapo surveillance operation right in front of them. Nothing our heroes do can match the V's counter intelligence and thus, they were always one step ahead of the good guys--for the whole season. The good guys did get a bomb off and destroyed the queens babies, but that was pretty much it.

Enter Season 2. From what I can gather, after watching the last episode, nothing much happens between the end of season 1 and the end of season 2. It must have moved very slowly. Too slowly with the same ""V"" out maneuver humans theme. Ok enough, we get it. We don't need 13 more episodes of season one--move to another theme already.

Spoiler Alert!
Season 2 ends with our heroin being abducted by--FINALLY--the good guys, ""Earth's last great hope."" This is an underground brain center where earths finest have been monitoring the V--unknown to the V--wow really, finally? I can't wait for Season 3. Finally we're going to get out of the aliens beat humans in every way, politically, intelligence gathering, technology, etc., to some type of conflict and strategy oriented season. It should be interesting.

I can only imagine how boring season two was, except for the last episode. From what I can understand, it was simply an extension of season 1 without any new information about anything. I'm sure there was some drama, but nothing strategically or technically interesting.",1366761600,,2066,4.827683615819209

The first ""V"" is still my favorite, but what I like about this series is it is more involved and interweaves plot upon plot and is quite clever at it. There is depth to the characters that I really like a lot.  It shows how much goes into the politics of this world (and even another!). It is quite involved and it felt ""fuller"" than the first one. The acting is very good as well. It just seemed quite unreal with all the energy everyone seems to have! What I mean is no one seems to get tired and just keeps going like the energizer bunny! LOL!

4175490,5,B003R0MEYA,"""V"" is the type of riveting, suspense-laden sci-fi drama you could plop down in an easy chair to begin watching -- and theoretically remain seated in, until the series' conclusion (presumably ten years later, if need be).

Show stealer Morena Baccarin, as the two-faced, reptilian Queen Anna, and leader of the invading Visitors, is one of the most attractively compelling, deliciously evil villains ever to appear on screen. Presenting before the people of Earth an inscrutable mask of gift-bestowing benevolence, we, the audience, quickly come to realize that behind her human facade is a merciless killer, embarked on a death-dealing mission to conquer our world and annihilate mankind.

Actors Joel Gretsch, Logan Huffman (and Elizabeth Mitchell, in particular) do a brilliant job lending sincerity and credulity to a storyline admittedly fraught with logic-defying implausibilities, yet, at the same time, abounding in the kind of compensatory plot twists that'll make you smile appreciatively each and every time they hit you squarely over the head.

Beautiful settings and realistic special effects (as adjuncts, rather than centerpieces in themselves), go a long way toward adding to the luster of ""V"".  And, as a precious little lagniappe, actress Jane Badler (erstwhile iniquitous leader of the Visitors back in 1984) reappears in a surprisingly unexpected role.

Note:  Get your ABC voodoo doll primed and ready to stick pins into, because at the end of Season II -- after a cliff-hanging episode that will literally have you SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER for Season III, the network bigwigs -- to their utter disgrace (and hopefully to their eternal damnation) -- canceled the series.",1337212800,,1690,5.3584905660377355
4175491,5,B003R0MEYA,"*SPOILER ALERT*  I am a huge fan of the original ""V"" and of ""The Final Battle.""  I thought Jane Badler was the most beautiful woman in the world when I was a child (which was when I first saw it).  When the series was remade, I was concerned that it wouldn't be as good.  At first, I wasn't impressed, but as it progressed I began to appreciate it.  The original is still my favorite, but I like this one too.

I was really excited about Season 2, particularly when Jane Badler made her appearance.  She is older--but she is still sexy! Of course, while I liked the idea of her being Anna's mother, I found it frustrating that her role was so passive for so long.  Season 2 was much more exciting, and the plot development was really interesting! As time went on, it didn't even really need Jane Badler to make it exciting--though I still was upset about the finale in regards to her character.

It is a shame the series was cancelled just when it was getting really juicy, but I am glad to have the DVDs.  As for the DVDs themselves, I was pleased that they came in a good package.  I don't like the ""paper"" type of sets the original and Final Battle came in.  This has a plastic hard case that goes into a protective holder.  It comes with a small booklet, which has attractive photographs, and gives a brief synopsis of each episode.  The DVD allows audio options in English and Portuguese, and the subtitles are in several languages (I love subtitles).

There are so many twists and turns, and one of the best cliffhanger endings I've ever seen.  Note to producers - we need closure - how about a miniseries to finish it off.

Following ABC's cancellation of V in May 2011, the fan letter-writing campaign ""Project Alice"" began writing to Warner Bros. to renew the series on a different network. [42] The campaign initially sought to get the show renewed on TNT, but more recent efforts have also concentrated on the CW Network as well. Both networks are owned by Warner Bros. Television's parent company, Time Warner.

Project Alice has been officially endorsed by executive producer Scott Rosenbaum, actor Mark Hildreth and actresses Morena Baccarin, Jane Badler and Laura Vandervoort, each of whom have made videos expressing their support and admiration of their fans' campaign.

Season 2 has more action and excitment than season 1 did so if your into V and have missed some buy the dvd sets.  They are really good!,1323734400,,349,4.028985507246377
4175511,1,B003R0MEYA,An absolute joke and insult to the original. I can't believe it made it to a second season. The acting and the ridiculous attempt at special f/x make me wonder how anyone can stamp their name to this catastrophe.,1322438400,2,212,4.461538461538462
4175512,4,B003R0MEYA,"Great remake of the 80's cult classic ""V""

Reptilians, Mother ships, and drama.

Enough action, and great story line.

It is best if you watch season 1 to fall into the start of this season.",1321315200,,190,4.371428571428571
4175513,5,B003R0MEYA,"Excellent SCIFI, with over 1 millions FANs on Facebook, why ABC chose not to continue it is just plain stupid.  Just wish Warner Bros. would continue on with Season 3 ""Project Alice"".  Loved the 80's version of this show as well.",1320364800,,229,4.560975609756097
4175514,2,B003R0MEYA,"I remember watching the old TV show and miniseries back in the 80's so was kinda bummed to hear they were going to redo it.
Well, like most remakes and reboots, they had the idea to run with from the original and build on.
One Problem, this show was Big letdown. Bad writing, annoying characters and clumsy plotting.
And in Season 2, the Producers, who knew they were hanging on to renewal by a thread, brought back the best thing about the original, Diana and unfortunately squandered her storyline. When on the screen, she stole the scenes, but they never let her out of the dungeon for the entire season. People had to go visit her. So, she finally gets out on the last episode and...well, you will see.
I knew after that, I would not be back if they renewed it and they didn't so I don't think many people were upset, except for a small group on Facebook bugging all the studios to get a 3rd season on some other network.
It never happened.
Like Heroes, or The Event or Flashforward, not to mention Terra Nova. They have the idea but can't find show runners that are competent to run a show with a long story arc.",1319587200,,1117,4.349282296650718
4175515,5,B003R0MEYA,"What would it be like if an advanced civilization of aliens contacted Earth with ulterior motives?  Perhaps a lot like the manner in which this series presents this scenario.  This is a really excellent re-make of the 80s ""V"" miniseries favorite.  In this one the special effects are far better, the acting is better, and the overall story is more plausible.  Elizabeth Mitchell (""Lost"") is terrific as Erica Evans, and Morena Baccarin is perfect for her role as the V leader.  The supporting cast is also excellent.

Season Two really comes into its own, and should have set the stage for several more seasons that would have steadily improved as the series came into its own.  Alas, the suits at ABC cancelled the series after the second season in what I must consider to be a serious error in judgment.

Season Two on Blu-Ray is really great to watch.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1319414400,2,881,4.7368421052631575
4175516,5,B003R0MEYA,"I agree with most of the reviewers about the new V.  The show was in the process of working itself out, building characters, and allowing the viewers to 'grow with the show.'  Then...bam!  Just like the crappy trend in television today, it gets canceled out of the blue.  Remember Flashforward and Pushing Daisies?  Another great series dumped without good cause.  I too am sick of it and now limit myself as to what new shows I watch. I watch very few shows and 2 are new 'trials' that I think 'might' make it for a little while, but then who knows? I gave this show a five star rating for the show.  If I was to rate ABC, it would be NO stars.",1318896000,,645,4.195121951219512
4175517,1,B003R0MEYA,"This is why I hate network TV. They get us to watch these shows and without consideration for the audience, which invested the time to watch 2 seasons (22 episodes), they leave the season finale on a cliff hanger then cancel the show. This has happened to me way too offen. This disturbing pattern seem to be happening more and more. Shows like ""The Unit"" (CBS), Reaper (CW), 4400 (USA) and ""Heroes"" (NBC) all were left on cliff hangers at the end of the season only to be canceled. This almost never happens to shows on HBO, Showtime and Starz. WTF. If the show is not getting the rating they want or expect all they have to do is a two hour movie TV special and tie up the story. Would you buy an unfinished book? Then why buy an unfinished TV series? Save your money and buy shows with awesome finales. Try ""Six Feet Under"", ""Friday Night Lights"" or the BBC version of ""The Office"".",1318464000,120,885,4.337349397590361
4175518,1,B003R0MEYA,"The first season of ""V"" was like most others, a lot of time spent on trying to 'get it's legs', as it were. Season 2 seemed to bring the story along quiet nicely with an amazing, cliff-hanger finale that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

As fans are anxiously awaiting the story to continue...not so fast.  The network, in its usual short sighted decision making process, which rarely gives any series the necessary time to develop, and has canceled future seasons.  So unless you like watching the first two parts of a 3, 4, or more part series and enjoy an incomplete story, I'd skip it.

The new remake of ""V"" is very good, and season 2 is quiet excellent, but we will not even consider watching a new series like ""Falling Skies"", or ""Terra-Nova"", and others, unless we know the story continues, or at the very least, concludes.

We were under the false impression the series would ""do justice to the original series"" and other such quotes from the network and producers, that the series would continue and come to an end.  Well it ended all right, abruptly, and with viewers hanging. This is not ""justice to the original series"".

I'm surprised this series on DVD makes a ranking of any kind.  This is the reason for my low rating.  The series is quiet good, and season 2 is excellent, but it's half of a story.  Unless you're the type that likes ripping out the last few pages of that sci-fi drama book, and feeling satisfied, I'd pass.",1317254400,28,1449,4.4961832061068705
4175519,5,B003R0MEYA,"This is the only review I've ever written online.  The series and and staff/actors were so great as well as the story line.  I bought season 1 hoping to support this show.  I will not buy the 2nd season as the jerks at ABC cancelled such a great show!  ABC seems to only understand things that hit their ""wallets"".  I urge anyone not to buy this show...ABC deserves nothing after such a great show with a great ending got cancelled!!!  I hope people think twice about helping ABC as they warrant no merit for letting down so many awesome fans!  If I could erase ABC from my cable box I would !!! It's not the first time they have done something so stupid with great shows, so maybe they will learn if no one buys the show.",1316131200,11,722,4.226277372262774
4175520,5,B003R0MEYA,"I am a sci-fi fan and I enjoyed watching this show.  Every week I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.  Especially with the evil Queen Alien.  I was thinking I was going to see the colony some how rise up.  Or the Evil Queen changes her ways as she continues to be effected by humans presence.  I guess I will have to make up an ending in my dreams,  ;-(  I can't believe it has been canceled!  Why not write to Warner Brothers Television and let them know how much you enjoyed the show.  You never know they may change there mind.  When I get some funds together I am getting all the dvds.

4175522,3,B003R0MEYA,"It's very simple really. Politics destroyed the V series!  The first V 2009 partial series got delayed and forced re-edited because of similarities in the philosophy of the aliens with those platitudes and policies of the Obama administration.  I read of more than one ABC exec being aghast that the show could reflect badly on their new found progressive hero and savior.  Indeed, I have a copy of one editorial cartoon showing Obama on the underside of the alien ships saying,""I come in peace"".  Many of the first ""1/2"" season episodes had gaps and many filler commercials where scenes had been cut and re-edited.  Now I don't think the show's writers had deliberately set out to attack the Democrats but the cult like build up of the Obama mystique with the ""swooning of women"" and the media promoting the projected dream of utopian peace of a ""hoping"" mass of voters onto the Obama blank canvas made such comparisons inevitable and ABC ordered changes for good or for ill, (the reader will decide for him/herself).  ABC remained tepidly supportive after that first season but also politically controlling and you got the sense that the writers were fearful and overly self restraining. Too bad....""V"" ye had potential but we ""hardly knew ye"", RIP!",1315180800,13,1251,4.9052132701421804
4175523,1,B003R0MEYA,"There aren't many good scifi shows and movies that are aired on TV these days. ""V"" was one of the good ones. The SyFy channel airs lousy ""B"" rated cgi movies and shows about 80% of the time. Only good shows that are aired now are Eureka, Warehouse 13, Haven and if I don't fall asleep, Alphas. When ABC cancelled ""V"", I cancelled my pre-order of the 2 season of ""V"". Not to protest ABC decision to cancelled this great show, but I don't like buying something that will not have a good ending. In my opinion, ""V"" did not have and will not have a good ending. I bought the entire series of ""Lost"" because it was a great show and it had a good ending which was planned long before the finale.

So here's a message for the yahoos at ABC. Shame on you.

So go ahead guys, click on the option, ""No"" when asked was this review helpful. I don't care what you think. I'm glad I gave my two cents to those yahoos at ABC really stink!",1312070400,161,923,4.093922651933702

4175525,5,B003R0MEYA,"SGU, Caprica, V, and The Event are all gone. Sci-fi is dead! Prove me wrong. All of the real sci-fi has been killed and stripped from American television.

All that's left are those lame so-called ""reality"" tv shows that are far from reality. I've got an idea for a ""reality"" show. How about taking politicians like republicans and put them on a minimum wage budget for a few months. Now that's reality for'ya!

The only real sci-fi show left on television is ""Fringe""! ""Eureka"" doesn't count because it's fantasy.",1308873600,18,514,4.764044943820225
4175526,4,B003R0MEYA,"I'm not here to give the show a bagging. I was getting more interested in the characters---except for some of the obvious bad actors. I think most viewers would know which ones I'm talking about.
I had intended to purchase both seasons and a third if it had been made but failing that at least to have a ""Serenity"" style movie tie up most of the cliff hangers.
The Networks have given the viewers the short end for too long but still managed to get some of our revenue by releasing a season not long after that season had screened.
So they figure to get some DVD revenue before we find out that they plan to cancel the show and leave the viewers hanging.
Well I fell for that scam several times and have Box Sets of series that had the plug pulled without regard for the viewer leaving us in mid air.
Sorry but this one is waiting until a series finishes as per ""BSG"" which gave us a conclusion and ONLY then will I put up my money to purchase the Box Sets of the complete series.
As for ""V The 2009 Series"" while it had some poor episodes they had left off at the end of season 2 with a whole lot of interesting plot lines which could have given closure to the whole series.
They blew it I won't be buying ""V The 2009 Series"".It's their loss as the episodes all screened here already.",1306886400,12,1285,4.185483870967742
4175527,5,B003R0MEYA,"This show was evolving and was changing into it's own mythos. Imo it was never as great as the original v, which is rightly considered a tv classic, but it was getting better and the v's reminded me of the corporations that are taking over the world today. They didn't leave us a ending though and that sucks. I don't even count on a tv movie for this one.  But after all the list of cancelled sci fi shows is gigantic, often programmers don't give these shows a chance and that's a fact.  The acting on this was top notch though, it's main problem was that it had to compete with the original in storyline which was about fascism in a more open manner and not corporate fascism that we face today among other issues. Still I will miss this one and the event and stargate universe as well. THeir are rumours for the other two but not a squeek about this one and even then I don't  hold my breath for the others sadly.

Unless you like a book with no ending, don't waste your money or time, you will be left wanting and likely will never get a finale. If another network buys it from Warner Brothers and continues it with a proper envtual finale - then by all means buy it, it is fantastic. If not, save your money for a show with a conclusion - in others words, wait and see - don't fall for this money grab without a guarantee of a conclusion.
