I do want to say I am sick of all the pointless, having to do with nothing reviews by the person named ""A Kids Review"" I have seen his posts all over amazon and they are not helpfull, they are just anoying to anyone trying to actually look up information.

Hopfully one day they will release the original 1st season when the show was called Good Morning Miss Bliss, now that I would like to see. Not to forget the two movies that the gang had Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas. They used to be avalible on VHS but are now out of print.

2299127,4,B0009KQP96,"I don't know what you guys think but I love the way Tori Wilson played in Saved by the Bell even though Kelly and Jessie aren't on Season five, Torri was a perfect replacement for the continuation of the show, till high school graduation. But the thing that ticks me off the most was that in season 1-4 there were a few episodes that were deleted, like when Zack and Slater get into a fight over the new girl. Or when sack Falls in love with Jessie in a Snow White School Play, and what about when Zack falls in love with Lisa in a fashion show in the Max and Screech gets mad over it. So that means these seasons are not totally complete, I guess Lion's Gate really screw up. But at the same time Im happy that there finally going to release the Tori episodes. I hope everyone that read my feedback feels the same way I do.",1116720000,8,824,4.124223602484472
2299128,3,B0009KQP96,"I don't understand this whole 5th season thing because frankly it ran for 4 years 89-90 season 1 90-91 season 2 91-92 season 3 and 92-93 season 4 do the math. And on the 1-2 seasons there are only a few episodes in each with makes no sense at all normal seasons last for about 24 episodes and in that set I saw much less tha 24 for each. If you look on the back cover of a tv show on dvd a half hour series usually runs for more than 600 minutes, and on the back of seasons 1-2 it says just over 700 which doesn't make much sense

Bottom line they shouldn't call this set season five they should call it what it is ""the lost episodes""  They should come out with the missing episodes they so geniusly left out of seasons 1-2 It was very wrong of them to call it ""the complete seasons 1-2 because I only counted so many of each and it didn't add up to two full seasons same goes for 3-4 and I have heard that they did the same with the show Alf which also came from Lion's Gate

I don't see them too customer friendly there isn't a spot on their site that I saw where you can contact them. They need to release the two movies Saved by the bell Hawaiian style and Saved by the bell wedding in Las Vegas on dvd two disc and in one package would be ideal!",1116374400,3,1250,3.932806324110672
2299129,4,B0009KQP96,"Finally, the last season of one of the best shows ever, Saved by the Bell.  Why they released (generally inferior) The College Years ahead of this, out of order, is a mystery.  This last season presented an unusual scenario: NBC wanted more episodes after they finished taping, and when Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani Amber Thiessen weren't available, NBC subsituted biker chick Tori to replace them.  The Tori episodes are decent, but you'll miss Kelly Kapowski.  One last thing: in order to fully complete the Saved by the Bell collection, they need to give us a 2 disc set of Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Last Vegas!",1115596800,14,657,4.7368421052631575

2299149,5,B0009KQP96,"Ok, after some research I have verified some information.  First of all, there is no Fifth season of Saved By The Bell.  I know we are all bummed.  What is going on is that the distributors of the disks have put different episodes on different disks.  I purchased ""The Complete Collection,"" then saw that there was a season five.  After buying season five, I found the episodes to be identical to my other disks.  It's been my experience that distributors mix things up to get you to buy more.  Second, the miss conception is that the first season is the short lived ""Good Morning, Miss Bliss.""  Many online sources list these episodes as season one.  This is what is causing the problem, those episodes are not part of Saved.

Before buying a selection of Saved By The. Bell, I would recommend verifying what episodes are included.",1409788800,5,832,4.636986301369863

2299169,5,B0009KQP96,"Yes, I was one of those kids that would run home everyday after school so I could watch the reruns of Saved By The Bell. One channel aired back-to-back episodes and at the same time another channel would air one episode. All my classmates watched the series and even my parents would watch on Saturday mornings.

After the series had filmed its last episode in which the characters had their high school graduation, NBC ordered more episodes. Actresses Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) had already moved on to film projects are were not available to participate in new episodes. Therefore a new character was created - Tori Scott (played by Leanna Creel).

Just like the two previous DVD sets, the episodes are out of order, going more by the syndication order. That's why the characters look older in one episode and a lot younger in the next. A few episodes have Jesse and Slater as a couple, but they broke up during season four!

The new student Tori becomes Zack's girlfriend and befriends Screech, Slater, and Lisa, but for some reason she never meets Kelly or Jesse. As I stated above the actresses who played the parts didn't return, but there names could have been mentioned more often. Continuity errors? Or were the characters Jesse and Kelly doing something else when Tori was around? After almost twenty years it is still a mystery to me.

The episodes on Season Five are:

Disc 1:

The Fight

Student Teacher Week

Screech's Spaghetti Sauce

The New Girl

The Bayside Triangle

Teen Line

Masquerade Ball

Day of Detention

Disc 2:

Wrestling with the Future

Drinking and Driving

Class Rings

Love Machine

Isn't It Romantic

The Will

The Teacher's Strike

Slater's Sister

Disc 3:

The Senior Prom

The Video Yearbook

Snow White and the Seven Dorks

Earthquakes

The Best Summer of My Life

School Song

Graduation

Time Capsule

The previous sets had cheap cases with horrible menus, but for some reason Lionsgate decided to change everything for the season five set. This set has a wonderful slipcover with the episode guide written on the inner pullout case. The menu on each disc has a neat little red bell ringing when you go to each episode. This is the only season set to include an actually bonus which is a documentary about the series.

I bought the DVD off of Amazon.com for fewer than eleven dollars and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. I now have seasons one through five and the two TV movies on DVD, so I can relive one of my childhood favorites anytime I want.",1349740800,2,2548,4.744292237442922

2299175,5,B0009KQP96,I grew up watching this show and it was great. All the characters were great and unique. The show's storylines dealt with issues kids faced in high school and how they themselves dealt with those issues. This show will make you laugh out loud and may make you cry at times. You'll be entertained with every episode. I recommend this DVD Set and the rest of seasons of Saved By The Bell on DVD.,1297814400,2,393,4.324324324324325
2299176,4,B0009KQP96,"Though I'm a 90s kid, raised as a little girl, I love this show. This is my favorite show of all time. My favorite characters are Zack Morris and Lisa Turtle. But the show would also be missing a lot if the other characters weren't present. I love Jessie's independent, feminist personality though sometimes it was exaggerated a bit. Kelly character was great, she was so sweet and kind. Then there was Lisa whom was the assertive one, loved her style. Zack Morris was Just so darn handsome. Then Slater the sexy jock. I think screeh's character was the least liked, though his humor does get you laughing and in a good mood. I have all season of Saved by the bell on DVD,seasons 1,2,3,4, and 5. Though the quality of seasons 1,2,3,&4 weren't great, it wasn't bad either. The best seasons to me are 3 and 4. But with season 5 it was a different story for me, the DVDs showed a little too bright which is why I give it 4 stars but overall the show to me would be 5 stars. Other than the DVD quality, overall I'm happy with my product. I plan to buy Saved by the bell:hawaiian style/wedding in las vegas next. Love this show!!!",1295568000,,1125,4.3364928909952605

I admit watching Dustin Diamond probably made me not want to watch the show with his recent behavior. The shows are jumbled with the introduction of the new girl and the subtraction of Kelly and Jesse and then epsiodes of Kelly and Jesse minus Terry. Usually the introduction of a new character in a tv series means the death of the show but this is an expection. Terry is watchable and doesn't take away from the show.

Overall, I enjoyed this season even if the epsiodes are out of place.",1254528000,,640,4.245901639344262

It was like going back to high school myself and I've been watching them non-stop since I got the packages in the mail!

The content is just as good. Season 5 of Saved by the Bell has some outstanding episodes that take advantage of the high level of comfort and cameraderie that the actors have reached with one another by this point, while at the same time bringing in wonderful new comic gags. Tori is a very good addition in her own right, but the episoded with her, while produced just as well, simply feel a bit empty to me without the ""original gang.""

2299191,3,B0009KQP96,"This starts off promisingly, with the savvy six getting up to more misdemenours at Bayside High School. Unfortunately halfway through the episodes Kelly and Jessie disappear without explanation and are 'replaced' by the rather lame character of Tori Scott. The episodes then alternate in their original airing order between 'Tori' episodes and 'Kelly and Jessie' episodes so it doesn't always make a lot of sense to watch them in this order. However, all's well that ends well with Kelly and Jessie miraculously reappearing for graduation. This is the worst DVD in the Saved by the Bell series, largely because of the arrival of Tori and the subsequently poor plotlines that seem to follow her wherevr she goes. They should have just stuck with Kelly and Jessie and made fewer episodes but overall it's a good few hours of entertainment!",1186876800,2,837,5.028776978417266
2299192,5,B0009KQP96,"What a good show.  I remember this one from the 80-90's and I thought my daugher might enjoy it.  It is way better than the shows on Disney now.

2299193,5,B0009KQP96,"Ahhh. The infamous Season 5 of Saved by the Bell. This season really shouldn't exist considering normal people are only in high school 4 years. If the seasons had neatly been broken up based on years in high school, nobody would have been confused.

The Season 5 episodes contain the ""Tory episodes"" and all of their senior year. The Tory episodes were done after the show had ended and the women who play Jessie and Kelly had already left the show to do other things. NBC wanted more episodes, so they had to find someone new to fill in for the 2 missing actresses. I think that it would have been more logical to continue it with just the remaining cast while finding an appropriate way to explain the absences of Jessie and Kelly rather than just pretending they no longer existed.

But, as far as plot is concerned, the episodes with Tory are more interesting. I like Leanna Creel as Tory a lot more than I did when I was younger. It's probably because she reminds me of someone I know in real life. However, you can't fool with the classic lineup of the gang even as you see that Elizabeth Berkley's heart was no longer in it. You can tell because her acting is so much different than in previous seasons. She seems almost airheadish despite always being the studious and serious one.

There isn't much continuity in the episodes. Of course, there was never much in the past either.

One special treat is an episode on the Season 5 collection that was shot in the third season but not shown until the fifth season: the Snow White and the Seven Dorks episode where they do a rap version of the classic fairytale. It is hilarious.",1175644800,7,1633,4.469798657718121

2299196,3,B0009KQP96,"I was watched the entire DVd and I noticed that One episode would have Tori in it and the very next would have Kelly. Like the episode right after ""the new girl"" featured Kelly. O_o. Or like one episode is the one where Zack and Lisa kiss and the next episode Zack has a crush on Tori and doesn't know how to tell her....I'm finally on episode 21 and it's ""The best summer ever"" where Zack is off the first day of school and they reminince about the Summer vacation (season 4 I think). So yeah episode 1 is actually episode 21 on this DVD. I wonder why they moved them out of order like that. oh well. It kinda takes away from watching the DVD but not tooo much.",1166400000,,662,4.1

Also, this 3 disc set features the very last ""original"" saved by the bell episodes, including graduation.

2299206,4,B0009KQP96,"In response to earlier post saying that there was no season 5:

NONE of the episodes on the Season 5 set are on the Season 1&2 or Season 3&4 DVD sets.  I now own seasons 1-5 on DVD, and I can attest that these episodes are NOT duplicates of other sets.

While most SBTB websites only have 4 seasons in their episode lists, it seems that there is inconsistency as to how the episodes are listed, and how they are divided into seasons.

These episodes (below) are on the Season 5 DVD set.  They are NOT on the Seasons 1-4 DVD sets.  (I got the episode numbers from a SBTB website episode list.)

62: The Fight,  63: Student-Teacher Week,  64: Screech's Spaghetti Sauce,  65: The New Girl,  66: The Bayside Triangle,  67: Teen-Line,  68: Masquerade Ball,  69: Day of Detention,  70: Wrestling with the Future,  71: Drinking and Driving,  72: Love Machine,  73: Class Rings,  74: Isn't it Romantic?,  75: The Will,  76: The Teacher's Strike,  77: Slater's Sister,  78: The Senior Prom,  79: The Video Yearbook,  81: Snow White and the Seven Dorks,  82: Earthquake,  83: Best Summer of My Life,  85: School Song,  86: The Time Capsule,  87: Graduation

Two episodes missing from this list (80: Screech's Birthday, and 84: Slater's Friend) were on disc 3 of the Season ONE DVDs.

So, this Season 5 set does NOT contain the same episodes as in other sets.  Any true fan of the show can look over those episode titles, and will remember at least some of them (like ""Teen Line"") and recognize that they are NOT in the sets for Seasons 1 through 4.

While Cody gets an A+ for effort, the episode that he refers to in his review is not a senior class trip, but simply a ""class trip.""  It is the first episode on the first disc from Season 3.",1121644800,69,1730,4.401273885350318
