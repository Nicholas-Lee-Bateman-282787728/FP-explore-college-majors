8614994,3,B00FES5L34,"If you have no knowledge of healing stones it had some helpful hints.  If you have some experience, this DVD is a bit disappointing.  As the name implies, I hoped to learn more about how stones heal, and how to work with them.  I also thought there would be more information about working with crystal skulls.  It was primarily autobiographical and not enough time spend on the benefits of the stones.",1432339200,,401,4.605633802816901
8614995,1,B00FES5L34,This was sooooooo bad.  The presenter took most of the time to speak about himself and barely spoke about crystals at all.  Very disappointing.  :(,1427068800,,147,4.8
