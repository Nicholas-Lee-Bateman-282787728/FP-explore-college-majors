8217366,4,B000V98XAO,"Again as with Part I, this is not a bad overview of the topic. The instructor, Alex Filippenko, a PhD out of Cal Tech, is very organized in his presentation. One might almost be able to deduce the outline of the course from the lectures themselves. I do find, however, that the instructor's arm and hand waving is a little distracting, it's almost as though he has too little to do by way of illustration and is desperately trying to draw pictures for the student in the air.  Unfortunately while what he's drawing is quite apparent in his own mind, it isn't so apparent in mine.  Some of the physical objects used to illustrate concepts actually did make things like eclipses clearer to me than they have ever been before, but again much of the weight of this type of illustration is left on the professor's shoulders, and with today's technology one almost comes to expect a little more.  Admittedly this is not a Discovery Channel or PBS documentary on the subject, and one becomes addicted to the computer graphics of these cinematic productions spoiling the viewer for anything less.  The graphics that there are, however, are fully adequate to the task of understanding the content of each lesson.  The doughnut on a leash demonstration was especially evocative in clarifying gravitational effects on objects in orbit around the earth.

This series of lectures deals with our solar system.  Because of my interest in history, my favorite lectures were on the history of our scientific understanding of the solar system, and particularly on the actual thought processes that led some early Greek astronomers to their understanding of issues like the shape of the planet, the relative sizes of the earth, moon, and sun, and the heliocentric orbit of the earth.  Some of their research techniques were quite inventive given the relatively primitive state of technology at the time.  Much of the information regarding the contributions of later astronomers, like Galileo, Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Newton were already known to me.

Although the courses date to the late 1990s and much has recently been discovered in astrophysics, nothing in the lessons is actually out of date; that is the student won't be receiving any inaccurate information.  Again as in Part I, if you've already read a lot on your own about the topic, you may find the course is a little lame. In that case, you may enjoy predicting what the instructor will say about a topic before he does. It's a fine confirmation of what you've already learned.

Like the previous course this one also focuses on concepts rather than on the mathematics of the physics; in fact the instructor goes to great lengths to explain that the mathematical concepts are just for those who are interested, probably to prevent those of us who are math shy from bolting! These formulae are somewhat more complex than those in the previous course, but putting the DVD on hold long enough to go over them yourself will probably help you understand them better.  Certainly for the student this should be a good way of supplementing and reviewing at a more self-controlled pace the topics that appear in classroom courses.",1283731200,,3168,4.888059701492537
