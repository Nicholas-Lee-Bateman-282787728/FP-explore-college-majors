4852724,4,B005OK0YP2,"The second installment of the Kane Richmond trilogy as The Shadow.  Even though this series is screwball comedy, considering the budget and the stars, this is an enjoyable adaption if you are looking for a different type of classic film experience based upon the franchise.

The Shadow doesn't turn invisible as many features have shown; instead, Lamont Cranston wears a dark cloak and mask to disguise himself from his uncle, Commissioner Weston and the foes he faces.

This film is campy but enjoyable to watch if that is the type of film you're into.  It isn't Airplane, by any means, but for the time period it could be considered as such.",1391212800,,643,4.7657657657657655

The last one has yet to be released on DVD but may be found on the Netflix streaming movie list.

4852730,3,B005OK0YP2,"From 1931 through 1953, Monogram Pictures Corporation was known to create films in Hollywood on low budgets.  Meanwhile, ""The Shadow"" was a popular serialized drama that was featured in pulp magazines by Walter B. Gibson and also featured on the radio as part of the Street and Smith radio program ""Detective Story Hour"".

The film adaptations began in 1937 featuring actor Rod La Rocque and in 1940 as a serial by Columbia Studios featuring actor Victor Jory.

But Monogram Pictures would begin their low-budget pictures with three films with actor Kane Richmond in ""The Shadow Returns"", ""Behind the Mask"" and ""The Missing Lady"".

And now the second film ""Behind the Mask"" has been selected for release under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"" which is the company's MOD (Manufactured-on-Demand) series, similar to Warner Bros. has done with Warner Archive and Sony's Columbia Classics.

The films do not have special features, nor have they been remastered, fixed-up or gone through any expensive restoration work. If anything, a lot of these films are targeted to a nice group of movie fans and collectors and are typically not the big giant titles that movie studios would want to promote.

And because Monogram Pictures films were low-budget films and the fact that interest in today's society towards non-blockbuster classic Hollywood films is waning, fortunately, there is a niche group of movie fans, such as myself who value these films, high-budget or low-budget.  Just the opportunity to watch them brings happiness to us.

But with that being said, because these films are not sold for cheap and are sold typically under $20 with no special features and nothing but the film, this group expects a good print with no major problems with the disc.

So, before I go with my review for ""Behind the Mask"", the question many will want to know first is... ""Does it play?"". I played this DVD on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems whatsoever. No stalling, no shadowing, no errors. It played perfectly.

The Shadow is the alter ego of amateur sleuth Lamont Cranston.  In reality, the Shadow is Kent Allard, a former aviator who fought for the French during World War I and has gone by different aliases in order to wage is war against criminals.  Allard fakes his death and returns to the United States and has adopted several identities to conceal his existence.  He has adopted the identity of Lamont Cranston, a wealthy man who is engaged to New York socialite Margo Lane.

In the Monogram Pictures version of ""The Shadow"", Margo and their assistants Shrevvie and Jennie Delaney know the Shadow's true identity and assists them in their case.  But because Lamont is also a charismatic man who attracts a lot of women, his girlfriend Margo is often jealous and tends to threaten to beat up any woman who tries to get close to him and also is jealous that she thinks he is messing around other women.

""Behind the Mask"" begins with showcasing Jeff Man (played by James Cardwell), a journalist who is also known for blackmailing those in the underground.  He can easily unveil their illegal activities but instead, blackmails them in order to get money.  So, he knows he is a target and so far, he has been fortunate in cheating death.  But the latest article that Mann is working on is to reveal the true identity of the masked vigilante known as The Black Mask.

The Black Mask, while seen as a hero, is not so liked by the police such as Inspector Cardonna (played by Dorothea Ken) who doesn't like this masked vigilante taking the law into his own hands.

Meanwhile, Margo Lane (played by Barbara Read) is hosting a party before she is to marry Lamont Cranston (who is the Black Mask) and everyone is wondering where Lamont is?  While Margo, the butler/servant and Lamont's assistant Shrevvie (played by George Chandler) and her assistant Jennie Delaney (played by Dorothea Kent) try to keep the guests occupied, Lamont shows up (after finishing up another case).

Back at the newspaper, as Jeff Mann is working on his article on the Black Mask, someone sneaks into his office and kills him.  As his colleagues are sitting back, they see a shadow from his office door and assume that the Shadow has killed him.  The reason is because his article was about revealing the true identity of the Black Mask.

As Lamont begins his investigation, he is warned by Inspector Cardonna to not get involved in police business.  But for Lamont, in order to find out who killed Jeff, he needs to get involved.  Even though Margot is no so thrilled that he is doing his own investigation before they are to marry.

With two people now being killed by this person disguised as ""The Mask"", Lamont meets with the newspaper secretary Susan who reveals that she has information on Jeff and has a key to access his private files that may lead to who killed Jeff.  But when Margo gets jealous and thinks that Susan is trying to win Lamont's affections, a near fight breaks out and Lamont tells Susan to wait outside of his apartment.  But when he is about to join Susan to get the files, he finds her dead inside the elevator.

But as Cranston tries to investigate Jeff's murder and seems like he's getting close to finding more clues, his jealous girlfriend Margot often gets in the way because of her jealousy, as well as her assistant who is dating his assistant Shrevvie and is also just as jealous.  And now, Margot wants to do her own investigation by dressing up as the Shadow, not knowing that the location that she will be investigating is where the killer (dressed like the Shadow) is headed.

Will Cranston be able to piece together all the clues and find out who killed Jeff Mann and Susan?

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality. There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Behind the Mask"", it's printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, according to MGM, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. But it's important to remember that Monogram Pictures Corporation films were created with a low budget and these films have not gone through any major restoration. With that being said, you can see the dust and scratches on the film, as well as mild flickering but other than that, the film is watchable and I personally had no problems watching this film, considering some Monogram Pictures films that I have seen were also not in the greatest shape, but compared to those films, ""Behind the Mask"" is watchable.

As for audio, the film is dialogue driven and dialogue is clear and understandable.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features for ""Behind the Mask"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a guy who owned various old radio shows on cassette of ""The Shadow"", it's always interesting to see the film or serial adaptations of the popular 1930's detective. Especially since the film is from Monogram Pictures.

Knowing that the film is 67-minutes long and is low-budget, still you have to admire how much fun they manage to put into this film by giving the character Margot and also for the assistants Shrevvie and Jennie with this latest film.  And it's something you just don't see in sleuth films, the main protagonist constantly getting nagged to the point where the girlfriend is often interfering with the investigation.

While the plot is what is expected from Monogram Pictures, fortunately the story does benefit from its many characters and the fact that we do get to see the Shadow in action.  But if anything, this is a mystery film mixed with slapstick comedy, so for those who are more into the darker mystery storylines of the original radio show may find this film a bit to comedic for their taste.

But for me, I suppose I enjoyed this film because I enjoy slapstick comedy and how it was integrated into the world of ""The Shadow"".  For those who are wanting to see the Rod LaRocque version of ""The Shadow"", they can find it in the Mystery Collection - 250 Movies (from Mill Creek) which were distributed by Grand National Films, Inc.  I have not seen the original 15-chapter serial featuring Victory Jory to compare.

But for the most part, ""Behind the Mask"" is a fun film, well-acted and sometimes overly dramatic for comedic effect.  Especially to see Lamont flaunt his charm on various women and seeing how Margot reacts to it.  But what it all comes down to is one's appreciation for ""The Shadow"" and whether or not you are up to seeing a more slapstick version featuring Lamont Cranston.

Overall, another Monogram Pictures film that I enjoyed via M.O.D. and hope MGM considers the release of the other two films ""The Shadow Returns"" and ""The Missing Lady"" on DVD.",1335571200,14,9047,4.745686900958466

This movie didn't have any of that.  Obviously, the viewers who were watching this movie when it was released in the 1930s knew what was going on and why the Shadow could disappear from sight, but the modern viewer might be confused.

The movie is treated almost as a straight-up mystery where a blackmailer meets his just deserts, and the Shadow is implicated, bringing Lamont Cranston into the investigation.  The Shadow part is played down, but slapstick is played up as people get knocked out and Cranston finds himself in compromising situations, which provoke his fiance into shrewish fits.  (The depiction of the women characters is really retrograde in this enlightened age.)  The slapstick elements get coordinated to sound effects, which was somewhat off putting in non-comedy.

The Monogram approach to the mask, voice, and general depiction of 'The Shadow' was very odd, but not nearly as shocking as Republic's 'CAPTAIN AMERICA'.

Story concerns The Shadow being framed for two murders on the eve of Lamont Cranston's wedding to Margot Lane.  Phil Karlson was a better than average director of poverty row films and the early scenes of this one showed a lot of promise with dark shadowy images including a nice shot of a reflection in a puddle of rainwater, a dastardly character in the form of a blackmailing newspaper columnist and a rogues gallery of blackmail victims who would all have good motive to want the slimy columnist dead.  But this goes downhill fast as soon as Lamont Cranston and Margot Lane are introduced at her zany pre-wedding party.  The sequence is just way too silly but it's a pretty good indication of where Behind the Mask is going, which is nowhere good.
