3952613,5,B002MU4NLS,"Item arrived quickly, in time for Christmas. My son is an avid Star Trek fan and really enjoys the show.

Thank you for quick response and timely arrival of this DVD.",1262995200,,166,4.354838709677419
3952614,3,B002MU4NLS,"This is a good -- but not great -- single-disc compilation for Star Trek newbies and cheapskates (such as myself) but not nearly as essential as its companion volume,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Star-Trek-The-Original-Series/dp/B001TH16CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Star Trek: The Original Series</a>. That first volume contained four of the Original Series' most vital entries, including the Vulcan adventure, ""Amok Time,"" the amusing ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" and the immortal ""The City on the Edge of Forever."" This time around we're given two bona fide classics, a jolly adventure story (on a mob-run planet, no less) and the second pilot episode commissioned by NBC which, while historically important, is a bit of a snoozer in the adventure-and-suspense department. Regrettably, the space (no pun intended... well, maybe just a little) taken up by these two latter episodes could've been occupied by other, better examples (the two-parter, ""The Menagerie,"" comes immediately to mind).

Should you decide to buy this, get it for the tightly paced, well acted ""Space Seed"" and for ""Journey to Babel,"" which will give you the quick-and-dirty tour of Gene Roddenberry's impressively diverse universe. Beyond that, you may wish to consider purchasing the series boxed sets as any further Best Of collections would only be superfluous to your introduction to -- and enjoyment of -- one of the most innovative and important Science Fiction shows in television history.",1258761600,33,1540,5.844444444444444
3952615,3,B002MU4NLS,"Like many reviewers, when Best of Star Trek TOS came out this past summer, I was confused why SPACE SEED didn't make the cut, but TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, AMOK TIME, CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER, and BALANCE OF TERROR definately rank as top episodes. So when it was announced a second Best of volume was being released, I crossed my fingers yet again and this time, it worked.

Volume 2 does include SPACE SEED, the first appearance of Khan, as well as WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE, A PIECE OF THE ACTION, and BABEL.  This is where I disagree with the selections.  I'd have gone for MIRROR, MIRROR and ARENA instead of BABEL and A PIECE OF THE ACTION, but then again, who knows - maybe there'll be a Volume 3. Then they could include the two part MENAGIRE or THE GALILEO SEVEN.

From the back of the case:

WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE - Warp speed goes wild when a Starfleet propulsion expert and his alien assistant come aboard the Enterprise to increase efficiency.

SPACE SEED - Kirk discovers a ship carrying cryogenically frozen survivors of the 1990s Earth war known as the Eugenic Wars.

A PIECE OF THE ACTION - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet run like 1920s gangster America.

JOURNEY TO BABEL - The USS Enterprise is transporting a delegation of diplomats, including Spock's parents, to a conference on Babel when Kirk is stabbed and the ship attacked.

As a fan of Next Generation and Deep Space Nine more than the TOS, these volumes are great for me and anyone else who just wants a sample. But I begin to wonder if it's more practical to suggest buying the entire seasons if they continue to issue best ofs.",1258416000,25,1630,4.442953020134228
3952616,4,B002MU4NLS,"I hadn't seen the original series since I was a kid. It is still fun to watch even now.

It holds up well and the playful interactions between the cast is what keeps it fresh. My only complaint is I wish they had more episodes available in this format.

Enjoy!",1374105600,,260,4.18
3952617,5,B002MU4NLS,I am a big Star Trek Fan.  This is a good way to see the original series for people who need the background.,1372377600,,108,3.6956521739130435

When I bought the three-season set, I thought I might both ""Best of . . ."" DVDs away to a friend.  However, I have decided to keep them.  Although the four shows are the same as those in the complete series set, the episodes in the set DO NOT have English subtitles.  It's a negative, but not a deal breaker.  On the other hand, the four episodes on this DVD and the four on volume one DO have English subtitles.  All this means that one of my friends will NOT be getting my copies of ""Best of . . ."" DVDs. ;-)",1366070400,,1271,7.328947368421052
3952620,3,B002MU4NLS,"Volume One was pretty good. ""Tribbles"" is a lot of fun. What should have been in volume 2 was ""The ""Menagerie"", the re-edited 2-parter ""The Cage"" with Jeffery Hunter. Also ""Nomad"", used as the concept for the 1st movie. What about ""Cat's Paw"" which looks far better remastered, as the puppet's ""strings"" have been removed. I guess I may have to buy the series discs someday. On blue-ray.",1363996800,,387,4.705882352941177
3952621,5,B002MU4NLS,"Probably, the best way to begin here is to ask: ""Who needs this DVD?""

If you're an avid ""Star Trek"" fan, the answer is no. Because you're probably just going to buy all the seasons anyway. And in this case, the DVD offers nothing new.

On the other hand, if you're just a casual ""Star Trek"" fan or a 60s buff looking for a little bit of nostalgia, this DVD will really give you a lot of ""Star Trek"" power and value for your money.

It begins with the episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before."" This is a very early episode with some characters that would not become regulars. But Kirk, Spock, Scotty, and Sulu are still there. Kirk has to watch a friend become more and more powerful (through an accident that left him with ever growing powers), and degenerate into evil. And the ever logical Mr. Spock has to confront Kirk with his only choice: ""Kill him while you still can.""

The next episode is ""Space Seed."" Kirk encounters a ship full of genetically superior beings lead by a man named Khan. It isn't long before Kirk and his crew are repulsed by Khan's superiority complex. And having seduced an unappreciated member of the Enterprise, Khan makes plans to take over the Enterprise. Anyone who knows anything about ""Star Trek"" should know that this story was continued in the 2nd ""Star Trek"" film. (""The Wrath of Khan"")

The third episode ""A Piece of the Action"" is a defining episode in that it shows the crew landing on a planet that embodies one very specific culture we can identify. (In this case, the gangs of the 20s.) Through a book on these gangs, the people of the planet have formed their culture. Interestingly, Spock can identify what is productive and good about the Chicago gangs. (Their intention is unity.) Another good thing about this episode is that while it has a great story, it also offers us a generous amount of comedy.

Finally, we have ""Jounrney To Babel"" where we meet Spock's parents. We can see that Spock and his father have not been on speaking terms for some years. And when there is a murder on the Enterprise, Spock's father becomes the prime suspect. Soon afterwards, he has a heart attack and with Kirk out of action, Spock must deal with the difficult choice. Can he relinquish control of the Enterprise (even though there are important ambassadors aboard, that there has been murder on the ship, and that they are being chased by a hostile ship) to take time to give blood to his critically ill father?

Summed up, if you're an avid fan who is just going to just buy all the seasons anyway, you don't need this DVD.

But if you are just a casual fan looking for a bit of nostalgia, this DVD will really give you a great taste of ""Star Trek"" and offer excellent value for your money.",1359676800,3,2725,4.479838709677419
3952622,4,B002MU4NLS,"I gave Vol. 2 a four star rating because of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"".  I did not like this episode very much.  It was boring. I have learned an even cheaper way to have The Best Of Star Trek episodes.  I use the streaming feature of my Netflix subscription.  Every episode of all five Star Trek series is available for streaming/instant play through Netflix.  So I write down the titles from the collections available and then watch them in order that they appear on a DVD.  This way I do not have to spend money, dust the DVD cases or find storage space for them.  There is the added value of not spending money on collections some of which have episodes I do not like.  I have been an enthusiastic Star Trek fan since TOS premiered in 1966.
However, not all episodes in the five series are great or even good.  So it does not make sense to me to buy all of the collections.  If I was inclined to buy various sets, I would go for complete series collections.",1350518400,,965,4.252747252747253
3952623,5,B002MU4NLS,I would give this 5+ rating. Product just as described and very fast service. Would definitely buy from them again. Thanks!!,1302739200,,124,4.9523809523809526
3952624,3,B002MU4NLS,"I bought this and the other volume for a gift at Christmas. The receiver has the complete TOS collection that was released several years ago (before the ""remastering"" and new special effects). So, I thought these two collection discs would be a nice taste of the updated episodes. They were. I could see a significant improvement in picture quality (makes me wonder why the older set was even offered). The new special effects (mostly exterior shots of the Enterprise and the planets it visits) are convincing, tastefully done (not extravagant), and consistent with the originals (e.g., the phaser shots in the ""Balance of Terror"" episode---a very early show---were improved but left as a sort of torpedo effect rather than a beam effect, thus preserving the original intent/experience).

I'd have chosen a few other episodes as the ""Best"", but hey, for the cost how can I complain?

I will say that seeing these much-improved DVD copies of 8 episodes almost (but not quite) make me want to buy the Blu-Ray versions of all three seasons. But, because I paid a crazy amount for the older ones, I'm not quite ready to take that plunge again. In most ways, I like seeing the TOS episodes as I remember them from my childhood, warts and all. It is wonderful to see that the original quality of the film is intact and that the Blu-Ray conversions will preserve this landmark series for posterity, but I'll wait to buy until the Blu-Ray's are dumped on the secondary market.",1295481600,6,1468,4.798418972332016
3952625,3,B002MU4NLS,"While I like the selection of episodes presented on this disc (particularly Space Seed - which looks terrific - and Journey to Babel), I was a bit disappointed to find that these are the remastered episodes WITH the CGI replacement effects.  Had there been an indication of this on the packaging, I probably would have taken a pass on this one.  Don't get me wrong, the remastering on the episodes is brilliant; each one looks crystal clear.  I just prefer the show as originally broadcast.  Personally, I think the model effects look better than the rather dinky CGI Enterprise.",1294012800,4,579,4.818181818181818
