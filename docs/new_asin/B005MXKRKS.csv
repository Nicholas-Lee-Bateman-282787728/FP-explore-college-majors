4839056,5,B005MXKRKS,Too bad they found it necessary to color his hair that awful shade.  She as beautiful as ever looked at times too old for the part but I did enjoy it even though I watched it holding my box of tissues.,1365811200,2,201,3.902439024390244
4839057,4,B005MXKRKS,"See above.  Would recommend it to someone my age, but not to
The younger generation. Mac/Eddy fans would love it.",1363046400,,113,4.65
4839058,4,B005MXKRKS,Very nice condition.  Not one of the best Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy movies but we enjoyed it.  Worth Owning.,1354406400,2,117,4.8
4839059,5,B005MXKRKS,Anything with these two stars in is a hit to me....I loved to hear them sing in harmony and alone.....they were unstoppable and wish they would have made more movies together......,1341792000,5,180,4.838709677419355
4839060,5,B005MXKRKS,"So nice that the Jeanette MacDonald & Nelson Eddy movies are coming out, can not understand why we have had to wait so long for them to be released on dvd. Great movie with a great picture and sound. One happy Aussie!!!",1333152000,4,219,4.238095238095238
4839061,4,B005MXKRKS,"This is not the best Nelson Eddy/Jeannette MacDonald film - but it is still very good.  Music is beautiful.  The delivery of the video was great, arrived ahead of expectation and in excellent condition,",1328400000,,202,4.911764705882353
4839062,5,B005MXKRKS,"Lovely music, good performances, and a story that is very funny at times and very sad at times. Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald had undeniable chemistry together.",1401926400,,165,5.148148148148148
4839063,1,B005MXKRKS,"This was a major Technicolor production for MGM with two important stars.  The ""transfer""  to DVD-R, if it can be called that, is atrocious.  Blurry in the extreme with color bleeding rampant.  WB obviously took no pains at all.  And why should anyone pay prime retail for a homemade DVD-R?  These are proving to have a limited lifespan, often oxidizing and developing errors within months.  A shameful way for WB to manage their important film legacy.",1398988800,7,452,4.868421052631579
4839064,5,B005MXKRKS,I gave this DVD as a gift and was called yesterday to say how much they have enjoyed watching it.  This really good old time movie was much appreciated.,1398124800,,152,4.241379310344827
4839065,5,B005MXKRKS,"I could not believe the clarity and color quality of the 1940 movie.  It had a good plot and was beautifully executed.  I saw that movie when I was five years old with my grandmother and remembered the song and Nelson Eddy in that cloud at the end,  so it was quite an experience to actually see it again in its entirety.  Janet McKinstry",1396828800,,338,4.234375
4839066,4,B005MXKRKS,"Not one of Nelson Eddy & Jeanette McDonald's best, but enjoyable just the same. If you are a fan of these two, then , I recommend it to you",1395100800,,139,3.8275862068965516
4839067,5,B005MXKRKS,Any movie that Jeanette MacDonald is in is great!! Love to hear her sing! A beautiful and talented lady! Highly recommend!!,1391990400,,123,4.904761904761905
4839068,5,B005MXKRKS,"The  saying that ""they don't make them like they used to"" is an old saw but it sure applies here . This duo that made only 8 films together is, in my humble opinion, the most dynamic duo to ever grace the silver screen. All the pity that they never made more ( they wanted to but were thwarted by studio execs at every turn). While this is not my favorite of the 8 films it is a treasure worth keeping. It exudes the charm, romance  and class without the crass of today's ""entertainment"".

  For the record, this was one of the complete set of 8 that I ordered from amazon. It is also only the second one that plays properly. Amazon is replacing the other 6 that were defective. That's why they got 1 star, not for the film itself , but for the fact they could not be played. All these films are 5 star gems. I look forward to my replacement DVD's and am hopeful that they work the second time around. When I get functional DVD's for each of the movie titles I will modify my reviews for them and change the 1 star to a 5 stars.",1388016000,4,1028,4.069306930693069
4839069,4,B005MXKRKS,I chose this rating because I didn't like the song chosen for Jeanette to sing when she meets his friends in Vienna.  Having Nelson die wasn't a happy thing either..  I would recommend this to Mac/Eddy fans.,1378598400,,207,4.5675675675675675
4839070,5,B005MXKRKS,"A sweet sombre ending for a Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald film, but  replete with lovable characters and the perfection of these two voices. Everyone should know these past musicals.",1371772800,2,187,5.233333333333333
4839071,5,B005MXKRKS,"Delightful story. No fiction, but realism in its most poignant. Melodious songs and clean entertainment for all the family. Highly recommended.",1371340800,2,143,5.857142857142857

8479961,5,B005MXKRKS,I am glad that these are being made available through Amazon. I have enjoyed the Eddy/MacDonald musicals since I was a child and it's a bit of going down memory lane to view them again.,1438041600,,185,4.314285714285714
