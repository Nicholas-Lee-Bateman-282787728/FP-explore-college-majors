3532240,5,B001DJLCZY,"I am a quality TV junkie; I love good story lines and imagery. So my favorite shows are the Wire and the now defunct Arrested Development. I never thought that something so good could come from a network that housed awful shows like Gossip Girl and Smallville. Supernatural is really, really good. The story lines bring to life our childhood urban legends with mixture of Greek mythology and religion. Really good visual effects that are better then some big budget movies, surprisingly good acting by Jensen and Jared. I would say it is the best ""free"" TV show out there now.",1236643200,2,576,4.712871287128713
3532261,5,B001DJLCZY,"Ghostbusters are good for a laugh, if you want a different kind of laugh along with action, drama and one heck of a story, you want Supernatural.  In all honesty I came onto Supernatural later, after season 3 was already out and ended up watching them all in basically one sitting and I was hooked.  It's just a very entertaining show, and if nothing else it is well worth sitting through all the episodes to watch the blooper reel at the end.  Trust me, if you like anything simi-spooky, you'll like this.  ;)",1247443200,,510,4.451612903225806
3532262,3,B001DJLCZY,"I love this show. It is one of those shows that just makes you want to see the next episode. If you believe that supernatural beings exist, than this is the show for you. If not, then I would suggest you skip it. If you don't believe, then the storyline is going to be too far fetched for you. Of course, it is entertainment. If you enjoy horror films, this series isn't that scary. There are some surprises here and there but overall not the cover-over-your-head type of show. Remember though that it was made for television.

The only real problem that I have with this series is that Season 2 will not play on my computer. As a matter of fact, it will not play on any computer. It does play on the little portable dvd player that I have though. Since I am away from home, I don't have a typical ""home"" dvd player. I assume that it would work in it if I were there.",1246924800,4,867,4.160714285714286
3532263,5,B001DJLCZY,"This is probably one of the best television shows I have ever seen. Once you start you will just keep asking for more. Great special effects, terrific acting, actual plots....every episode could be made into a blockbuster movie.",1245974400,,228,5.026315789473684

Enjoy.",1243728000,,391,7.818181818181818
3532265,4,B001DJLCZY,"If your even a remote fan of the show, it is worth buying. There is a lot of subtle clever humor and references that you don't catch while watching on TV, but catch when you have time to watch at your leisure.",1241740800,,209,4.0
3532266,5,B001DJLCZY,This show has it all action suspense love history I could not have found a better show!,1239667200,4,87,4.176470588235294

3532268,4,B001DJLCZY,"Supernatural is a must see! Have been hooked since the pilot first aired and have watched it ever since, can't wait until season 4 and 5 comes out on DVD as we are still in season 2 in New Zealand. The series has been well written and definitely gets better with each season. Supernatural just gets better and better.",1239062400,2,317,4.389830508474576

The box sets arrived in perfect shape and she was excited to received them.",1469059200,,138,4.791666666666667
8293801,5,B001DJLCZY,I've been a fan since the first episode. Urban legends are my favorite sort of scary story so I loved the first seasons especially. Not so much a fan of the angel-demon theme that punctuated a great deal of the later seasons but they threw enough humor & side stories of general spookiness to keep me watching. Bravo to the Winchester boys!,1360281600,,340,4.5
8293802,5,B001DJLCZY,My son and I are Supernatural fans and have been watching every season since they started.  This was a great value and we've watched them all over and over.  Can't get too much of the good winning over the evil.,1325548800,,211,4.25
8293803,5,B001DJLCZY,The first three seasons give the beginning of an epic story. The creativity of Eric Kripke and the performances of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. The best combination.,1309996800,,171,5.142857142857143
8293804,5,B001DJLCZY,can't get enough of these two!!! the early seasons are as good as the current ones...,1264809600,,85,4.375
8293805,5,B001DJLCZY,"all i can say is Dean and Sam are amazingly cute and who wouldnt want to watch them fight demons and supernatural beings... other then that, its got a good story line throughout the seasons but is also great for those people who miss episodes because each week is a different town with a different storyline, amazing effects, fantastic music, great car, and very interesting cases that they have to sort out... I've enjoyed every single episode!!!",1262995200,,447,4.818181818181818

8293807,4,B001DJLCZY,"The shows plot is very complex and winds its way through all of the shows in a slow and unexpected build up.  I find the show to be very entertaining. The best show on TV as far as I'm concerned. Although there is much blood and gore in this show, the brothers go about their business in such a ""day at the office"" way that it is somehow less scary then it otherwise whould be.  Their relationship makes the show.  The special effects are movie quality.  I would highly recommend this show to any adult.",1251331200,,503,4.2631578947368425
8293808,4,B001DJLCZY,"Supernatural Seasons 1 thru 3 were very entertaining.  I did not get to watch them on the WB but read about them on Amazon.com, so I bought all three seasons at once.  I was not disappointed as I found Supernatural to be well written, thought out and tied together very well.",1249344000,,275,4.372549019607843
