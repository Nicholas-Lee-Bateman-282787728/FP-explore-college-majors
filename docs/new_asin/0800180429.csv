168406,2,0800180429,"I admit that I've gone on a Russell Crowe film spree.  I think he is an  amazing actor with unbelieveable range and depth. But this has to be the  weakest film of his that I've seen. I haven't seen the first 3 films that  he was in or ""Love in Limbo"", ""Rough Magic"" &  ""Heaven's Burning"". So my opinion could change.  This is after  all just my opinion.
I don't think the director knew what to do with his  actors besides making them run around.  This is film... let the actors  faces tell some of the story.  I just didn't feel that connection I've come  to expect from Mr. Crowe.
As far as Russell doing the the New York/New  Jersey accent there was a bean instead of a bin/been. But I only noticed  that one slip.  Picky, picky, picky.  Next",961286400,3,744,4.207142857142857

168442,1,0800180429,"Oh lord, this is a bad film. I can almost always watch Russell Crowe, but the rest of it was so awful that I was having a hard time of it. The plot was nonsensical, and the script atrocious, in ways that made me feel bad for the lead actors, who - to their credit - went ahead and turned in performances anyway.

This got filed to the bottom of my collection of Russell Crowe films.",1406592000,,382,4.026315789473684

168445,5,0800180429,"Loved this movie, cause this is the first film I seen Russell play a father ( before he even became one in real life) he showed that he can bring the sensitivity to a character and still be just a serious and convincing when it comes to playing a copper.",1382227200,,254,4.1
168446,2,0800180429,"Russell Crowe is great in this movie, but he can't save a badly written script. Female flight attendant character is annoying and ruins the movie. Story is poorly written and plot is very disjointed.",1374710400,,199,4.882352941176471

168472,2,0800180429,"I actually missed this film altogether from cable to VHS to DVD, but once I saw a Blu release I thought it might be worth a shot. This film must have had a place in the 90s action genre library, but it had no place being saved here (in HD) other than to record Crowe's earlier works.

The film content is laughable, and the amount of flubs and mistakes were the highest I have seen in virtually any 90s film of this genre. So I skipped finding everything wrong and instead went for a quality review on the Blu end. Admittedly, this movie has loads of opportunity in creating a nice reference for Blu display testing; The deserts, skylines, color contrasts (especially that red flight attendant outfit against the sandy backdrop) and big action are ripe for being a sleeper. Instead Sony went the low budget way and did little to clean it up. The picture looked the same as the upscaled DVD, and the TrueHD was uneventful. The CGI failings somehow became even more prevalent, so maybe there was some edge enhancement done or an equivalent that ended up not producing a competent reference. I would have to say the opening sequence with Kelly Hu was actually the best test (red lipstick, pale skin makeup contrast). Was strange seeing the 747 fly below the Twin Towers, and then even worse seeing it fly through the mountains like it was a Cessna....anyway.

No special features and not a recommendation unless maybe you never got the DVD.",1245024000,6,1437,4.609375
168473,1,0800180429,"The first six minutes were promising.  With a cast that included Russell, Kelly and Ian, I thought this would be a B movie that would be an enjoyable romp.  Was I ever wrong.  This movie just went straight downhill from the get go.  Besides there being absolutely no chemistry between Crowe and Slater, it was painful to watch them.  It was a painful experience all the way around.",1231027200,3,381,4.544117647058823
168474,2,0800180429,"Did anyone beside me notice in the beginning of the movie, when Saiko (the FBI UC woman) blew away the bad guys, her semi-auto's slide never recoiled back? Okay, small detail. Did anyone notice Russell Crowe (Zack) using the same gun on the airliner that John Malkovich used, to attempt to assassinate the President in Clint Eastwood's film ""In The Line Of Fire?""

Well, gee, Helen Slater (she was Super Girl, remember?) was pretty entertaining as Mary, the airline stewardess/hostage. On the other hand, Crowe's superior (whoever she was) was one terrible actress. The Mob father; Serlano (Michael Lerner) of the son who was killed (scrotum and testicles no longer attached) by Saiko (who kills herself, soon after), kidnaps Crowe's son; Eric, until he brings the Yakuza dude - Yuji,(Etsushi Toyokawa) to him.

Uh.. Crowe, the FBI guy, and the Yakuza dude go on a desert hike after the Yakuza dude hijacks the plane they're on, on their way to FBI headquarters....and uh, the bad guys take the Yakuza guy from Crowe in the desert and Helen Slater goes along for the ride. Never mind. The Mob lackeys are also low-class actors. I.....just don't know what to say about this movie. It was pretty bad. Oh, the desert showdown between the FBI guys, the Mob guys and the Yakuza helicopter dude; was pretty sad (as in pretty bad).

Anyway, Yuji, Zack and Mary join forces to rub out Serlano and his flunkies in a trap to save Zack's son. There, I spoiled it for you. So the ending was good, but the movie as a whole, wasn't(?)

All in all, I think Helen Slater was the star of the movie. She's a real jewel. (Her conversations with the cop in the car, and with bad guys at the lake are priceless). Maybe I'm wrong, but it's possible that this movie was supposed to be funny.  FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT, PLEASE.",1219363200,,1800,4.6125
168475,2,0800180429,"When FBI Agent Zack Grant, played by Russell Crowe (Cinderella Man, Heaven's Burning), loses his partner Seiko Kobayashi, played by Kelly Hu (Scorpion King, X-Men2:X-Men United), in a blown up operation, a Neo-Nazi son of a mafia man named Victor Serlano, played by Ian Ziering (Beverly Hills 90210, Domino) also dies and his father Frank Serlano, played by Michael Lerner (The Mod Squad, Godzilla (1998) with a not so believeable mustasche, kidnaps Zack's son Eric, played by little Andrew J. Ferchland (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and so Crowe goes all gung-ho renegade, so Lerner wants Yakuza member Yuji Kobayashi, played by Etsushi Toyokawa (Love Letter, Dog Star), and he wants Crowe to bring him back to him and Crowe will get his son back. But things get complicated along the way, and Crowe's prisoner is making him tick along the way. Crowe and Toyokawa are joined by airplane stewardess Mary, played by Helen Slater(Supergirl, The Legend Of Billie Jean) who is also a hostage in the whole mix. This Action Thriller goes like this, good moment, boring moment, good moment, ok moment, boring moment, good moment, ok moment, boring, boring moment, good moment and so on. One of the OK Crowe movies before he got into doing really good stuff...here he saves this from being a total disaster....him and actor Etsushi Toyokawa make this worth the watch. Christian Slater's Sister, Helen Slater has some funny oneliners and is sexy holding a gun...that's basically it and Ian Ziering was wasted in a small role. If you're a fan of Crowe like I am, I recommend this but to those who don't like Crowe, well...just watch it once.",1130112000,4,1633,4.898916967509026
168476,5,0800180429,"I like this movie simply because it was entertaining.  There's no deep drama, brainiac prose or intense emotional scenes here.  It's just a story about your average cop with a major attitude problem who has a somewhat strained relationship with his 7(?) year old son.  The reasons as to why there's a seeminly lack of affection from this single father to his son is explained through poignant flashbacks.  The movie is LA Confidential meets Rush Hour.  I found Crowe's character humorous, simply because he's so grumpy and prickly, one wonders if it's possible for anyone to be that rude!  The ending is uncharacteristically endearing for a movie of this genre. Definitely a must see for Crowe fans.",1048550400,11,699,4.931623931623932
168477,3,0800180429,"While I am a huge fan of Crowe's... this was NOT one of his better performances.
There is plenty of action, more than average suspense but the dialogue is lacking greatly.
Phrases and sentences that just don't make a lot of sense permeate the entire script. More specifically, I found myself saying ""would they REALLY say that in this situation???"".
Russell drops in and out of his ""American"" accent, which is a painful reminder of the fact that this is one of the earlier films in his now stalwartly coral of films.
STILL, that all being said... if you are collecting the lot of them... it is worth the purchase if not for anything other than to be able to see just how far he has come.
Enjoy!",1038268800,7,694,4.4296875
168488,1,0800180429,"From the typical action movie title that slips out of your memory within days to the typical overused clichs, I felt like I had seen this one before. Surely Crowe is a good actor, but he isn't exerting himself in this blah flick, and he definitely can't save it from the suspense B-list (at best). There is really no reason to buy this DVD, even with the one talented actor in the cast.",1025308800,2,386,4.301369863013699
168489,2,0800180429,"I have almost all of Russell Crowe's movies, but unfortuneatly this may be his worst.  Everything about it goes against what Russell prides himself in making a movie.  His charactar's dialogue is contrived and unrealistic.  He is famous for battling directors when it comes to the integrity of his charactar, but he didn't win this battle.  His co-star Helen Slater played a stupid girl with stupid lines, again a co-star's charactar the Russell must have had little patience for. I can overlook a bad movie and still enjoy Russell, but I wasn't able to in this one.",1013126400,4,566,4.804123711340206
168490,3,0800180429,"This is not Crowe's best OR worst movie.  I found a lot of heart in this story of a father trying to save his son, by going against his bosses, to surrrender an alleged murderer to the father of his victim.  Good shoot out up front, good one in the middle, good ending.  Great AZ location shoot!
Helen Slater added much humor to a serious story, and Russell plays well with her character.  Gives him a chance to smirk and crack wise.  (Note the KIWI Mary carves for Zack).
Anyone notice how there always seems to be some reference to Australia or NZ in every Crowe non-Australian or NZ movie?  Worth a look for the Crowe fan.  I love the long hair & beard.",996019200,15,656,4.241935483870968
168491,2,0800180429,"Stupid story. Since when do skinheads work for the Mafia? And how did the Japanese get involved? When is the last time a Mafia king-pin kidnapped an FBI agent's son? Nevertheless, Helen Slater saves this from the re-cycle bin. She is sweet and good-natured and her scenes with Russell Crowe are the best part of the movie. (Get a hair-cut and a shave Russell. I got sick of watching you push your hair out of your eyes, only to have it fall back into disarray.) We saw L. A. Confidential and liked the three leads, Crowe, Spacey and Pearce, so we have been shopping for more of their work. We should have passed on this one.",994464000,2,624,4.387931034482759
168492,4,0800180429,"Crowe displays his developing skills as an action hero, giving us a glimpse of what got him an Oscar in ""Gladiator"". As an renegade-style FBI agent, he takes us on a hot pursuit where he'll risk anything. Helen Slater (City Slickers) provides some terrific comic relief. There's plenty of action and fun making this film a great watch. It's a must have for collectors of Russel Crowe movies and worth your money for action viewers.",990921600,,431,4.76
168493,4,0800180429,"This is not rocket science material.  It is escapism and nothing more.  The two saving graces in this movie are Russell Crowe and Helen Slater.  The banter between them is worth every second.  They argue about humming and who the best starship captain is.  I would have liked to see more character development between Slater and Crowe.  The ending left a lot to be desired, but hey, one can't be too critical of any movie with Russell Crowe.",983318400,2,441,4.589743589743589
168494,2,0800180429,"Honestly, I'm not really sure what type of review I could give this movie! I mean the hard rock in background music was okay, and it has some pretty good action scenes to it! I really rented it because I wanted to see Helen Slater in it! I did get my fair share with Helen playing the Mary, the dim-witted flight attendant! I liked the scene with her and Russel Crowe debating who's the better ""Star Trek"" Captain! Crowe liking Kirk (of coarse), and Slater adoring Picard! But honestly the movie was a bit loud and story undeveloped (especially the ending)! Crowe did some fair share with his role of Zack Grant, but if Mel Gibson was cast in the role, that would have given the character some style and justice to his part! In all honesty, and not to offend Ms. Slater, but I feel that a 2 star rating fits this movie perfectly!",980035200,,829,4.354838709677419
168495,3,0800180429,"No one would say this film is worth to keep forever, but... But, as one third zone thriller, one migth say the buying is acceptable. Certainly the occasion to see Russell Crowe in a widower/father part. A pity the relationship with the boy is so bad shown, a pity the character are so thin. A Z movie only available in video rental. Try it.",972777600,,340,4.328125
168496,5,0800180429,"I am constantly amazed at his abilities as an actor.  I fell in love with Russ watching LA Confidential, and was determined to seek out every movie he's been in.  I really enjoyed No Way Back as it falls into one of my fave  movie genres - the action/drama/organized crime and police type films.  His  NYC accent was convincing, and his intensity, as always, put this film into  the ""I'll watch this over and over again"" category for me.  There  was a perfect mix of drama and action, with just a touch of comedy.
I'm  glad I bought it from Amazon!",962064000,15,548,4.346534653465347
168497,4,0800180429,"This Russell Crowe film is one of his least known works.  One should realize it is not in the same caliber as his other great films, but one that should be appreciated as strictly an action hero performance instead.  ""No Way Out"" was not a theaterical release, instead it debuted on  cable televison.  It has the typical elements of a made for t.v. movie  fare; weak script and storyline,  minimal character development, and  strictly action-driven.  However, Russell Crowe turns this film around from  your typical action genre movie to a well-paced and well-acted film on his  part.  This is the first role of Crowe's where he plays a father and a  widower.  It is ashame there was not enough of an established relationship  between father and son.  However, it was so adorable to see the character  of Zack Grant talk to his son as if an adult and have his son call him by  his first name.  I believe you will be pleasantly surprised by this  different kind of film, character, and performance by Russell Crowe in his  fourth U.S. film.
