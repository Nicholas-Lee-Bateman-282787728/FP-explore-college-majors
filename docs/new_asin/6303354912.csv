627065,5,6303354912,"After seeing this movie, I was really in awe. Imagine the scenes from Traffic depicting the ghetto and then blow them up to a whole new scale. I mean this movie does it with such realism and simplicity. I really don't know how a person can remain conservative and 'darwinistic' after seeing a movie like this. Its political/social commentary is biting. Here's a kid who is smart, brilliant actually, but whose environment is consumed by poverty and despair. If you watch this movie and still think that all it takes is hard work to 'make it', what can I say, you're either naive or stupid. Watch this movie and please, take something from it.",998352000,,642,4.640350877192983
627066,5,6303354912,"this movie was outstanding.  I've seen it many times and cannot wait for the DVD to come out, as my tape is on its last loop.
I will defend the music and say that works really well in this film.  It's not the kind of thing you would go out and purchase seperately, however. The writing is also superb, nary a wasted word, although some lines seem kind of awkward, forced or inauthentic - one of the three.  The director Yakin apparently did a lot of research on the streets of some tough neighborhoods in New York to prepare himself to write this drama.  All things considered, I think he did a fine job.
Sean Young puts in a better than adequate showing, Giancarlo Esposito is captivating as Esteban and Samuel Jackson is wonderful as Fresh's deadbeat, chess-sparing father. Chess, by the way, is a theme tailored to the plot in this coming of age story, as the pieces on the chess board come to represent figures in young Fresh's life; some, er, most of whom he must sacrifice in a gambit that will get him and his heroin-addict sister out of the ghetto.",978048000,2,1056,4.427835051546392
627067,5,6303354912,"A very powerful film, tightly plotted, well-written and wonderfully acted.  Fresh's chess games with his father, and the advice he receives therein, brilliantly foreshadow the moves he will later make in a real-life game of chess against the powerful drug dealers who control his neighborhood.  This one kept me guessing all the way to the end and is doubly impressive because it presents a plausible scenario in which a very intelligent twelve-year-old boy might overcome the odds against him.  The last shot, a picture of Fresh's face, is an example of a perfect final image because it reveals an aspect of character that I had not seen before (although I always knew it was there).",974332800,2,684,4.930434782608696
627068,4,6303354912,This is not a glossy xerox of  New Jack City. In the world of 90s black gangsta films Fresh takes a grueling look at a 12 year old drug runner well played by Sean Nelson. Much maybe too much foul language can make the movie  seem cheap and futile at times. This may be the darkest film of it's kind  as you witness a young girl murdred in a basketball game in a crossfire by  a disgrunted player. While it is obvious (Boaz) is going for some shock  value he cunningly casts Samuel L. Jackson in a limited role as Fresh's  estranged father and maybe more importantly Giancarlo Esposito as drug  pusher and boyfriend to Fresh's older sister. Giancarlo steals this movie  as a guy you love to hate and a very familiar street type. Sean Nelson as  Fresh is amazing in his ability to make you see his tolerance for the pain  of his dysfunctional childhood. He uses his gifted intelligence to escape  what could be a very catostrophic situation. Just a note that although the  bad language is neccesary it's use seems like an alternative to good  script. Lines seem to be ad libed by the young actors. This movie however  dark and disturbing does what it intends to do. It tells it's streetlife  story without glamourizing it! Welldone for the most part!,961286400,3,1248,4.484444444444445
627069,5,6303354912,"This is a very recent film that I watched at the suggestion of one of my co-workers (Hey Harlan!). I was captivated by this film from beginning to end. Its raw power is undescribable, and the performances by the lead actor  in particular (Sean Nelson) was brilliant. The story deals with a young boy  who has become a pint size drug runner. He, however, is extremely  intelligent and knows that there is no future in this type of life. He sets  out to become a man, and in the process many lives are changed, most  importantly his own. It is a film of astonishing and unrelenting power  which should be seen by everyone. I was very impressed with  screenwriter/director Boaz Yakim's decision not to put the usual soundtrack  that befuddles urban films, instead, the instrumental score brings yet  another dimension to this already multi-layered motion picture. Kudos to  Giancarlo Esposito in the role of Esteban.",956707200,15,913,4.832258064516129
627070,5,6303354912,this film doesn't apologize for it's Honesty.very much up front about surviveing the streets. Sean Nelson gives a solid Performance here that you almost forget about Samuel L.Jackson.also the very underrated Giancarlo  Esposito who played Buggin'Out in Spike Lee's Classic Do The Right Thing  gives a solid Performance here. The Hustling&drugs and Violence never  overshadow Sean Nelson's Role.he stays above water. A Must see.,952819200,,427,5.640625
627071,5,6303354912,"This is one of the most emotionally moving movies that you will ever see. If you havn't seen ""Fresh"" yet, then you need to see it ASAP. It ranks up there with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and  ""Seven""  (Morgan Freeman sure does know how to pick a great  script!). The first time I saw the movie it blew me away. I only wish that  I had known about it when it was playing in theaters. I hadn't even heard  of it until my friend got it on vidio. The soundtrack is truly fantastic,  but is apparently unavailable. This is extremely annoying due to the fact  that I can even find the pathetic soundtracks of made for T.V. movies in  any store. If anybody has any information on how I can obtain the  soundtrack I would appreciate it greatly. Now go see ""Fresh""!",951177600,,755,4.297872340425532
627072,5,6303354912,"With the exception of a audio track that sometimes gives the impression that students were hired to record the sound, this is quite possibly a perfect movie. Given two thumbs WAY up by Siskel and Ebert, this film is a  tightly written and well acted. The initial opening, which confused me at  first, on later viewings revealed itself to be the setting of the  chessboard upon which the title character plays his most important game --  Namely, his life. If you are a lover of suspense, intelligence, or chess  (Fresh uses chess tactics to checkmate his opponents and save the  ""queen"") than This is the film for you. Because, at first glance,  this film is about African Americans and drugs -- but with relatively  little violence, the distributors had no idea what to do with it and it  received lousy distribution and little advirtising. It is NOT however so  much a film about drugs and violence, as it is about an incredibly  intelligent, hard working kid who uses all the resources available to him  to get himself and his sister a better life. I have seen this film multiple  times, and to my amazement found NOT ONE line of wasted dialogue in the  whole thing... which makes the lousy soundtrack all the more annoying.  Additionally, it has the complex construction of a Dickens' tale --  seemingly unrelated details all coming together to a tighly knit  resolution. If you are a serious student or lover of film, this is one to  be savored.",932688000,21,1449,4.682539682539683
627073,5,6303354912,"The acting is superb, the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will lie awake for nights on end, haunted by this movie",928972800,,130,3.8518518518518516
627074,5,6303354912,"I rented this movie on a whim a few years ago and got so absorbed in it that I watched it twice more that same night.  I'll admit that I had misconceptions about the movie....it is a very complex look at the people caught up in New York's drug trade, particularly Michael, aka ""Fresh"" who is a baby runner for both a heroine dealer and a crack dealer.  Unlike his friends, Fresh is very savvy and gets by on brains and chutzpah.  But even he can't escape the swim that his environment puts him in after he witnesses the brutal murder of a close friend and the girl he has a school yard crush on.  Fresh uses his ability as a speed chess player to put events in motion where he can gain revenge and try to save his sister who is involved with one of the drug dealers.

The movie demands repeat viewings to catch all the subtleties (sp?) and to understand the dialog.  The score is absolutely brilliant; unfortunately all you can  find musically is a tribute album, not the actual soundtrack.  Buy it, rent  it....just leave yourself time for more than one viewing.",922838400,,1063,4.38265306122449

627211,5,6303354912,"A raw, frank, intricate and beatifully produced portrait of a life-and-death struggle in the Inner City. Sean Nelson gives an amazing performance as a child struggling to extricate himself and his sister from a potentially deadly web of crime and violence. Samuel L. Jackson is superb as his father, who guides him through the intellectual exercises of chess, unaware that his son uses these lessons in the real world to defeat vicious criminals, including Giancarlo Esposito's drug trafficker. Cinematography by the great Adam Holender (MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK). A beautiful orchestral score by Stewart Copeland (of THE POLICE).

627456,5,6303354912,"Several months ago my 14 year old gamer started nagging me about wanting to play Grand Theft Auto (GTA), because all of his friends were playing it.  Up until then I had been very adamant that that particular game was off limits.  He was quick to point out that the newest version is not as bad as previous versions and that would appear to be the case.  Nevertheless I still had reservations.  We don't ban too many games, but I had watched videos of the game over the years and found it disturbing.  I don't like the glamorization of ""hood"" or ""thug"" life.  I wanted him to understand that kids who grow up in that environment are often trying to navigate a virtually impossible minefield trying to get out.  That the reality is far from glamorous.

Anyway, I eventually told him if he watched the movie ""Fresh"" in it's entirety he could play the game.  This isn't the first time I've fallen back on a particularly good film to illustrate to my children that life is infinitely more complicated than we often imagine.  Long story short he watched it.  When it was over he came to me and simply said ""mom, I get it"" and the look on his face made it very apparent that he did indeed ""get it.""  We've talked about racism over the years, but it was this film that truly opened his eyes.  In this end he did play GTA for a short time before getting bored with it.  I have no doubt that much of the reason it did not hold his attention for long was that this film literally inoculated him from the perception that the portrayal of the ""hood"" is glamorous, when in reality it is anything but.  That in reality many many kids want out, but the obstacles are almost impossible to overcome.  For a time we are all prisoners of our upbringing and environment until one day some of us ""wake up"" and desire something more.  In white suburbia this is not difficult.  In most situations for youth all over the world, it is next to impossible, and I admire anyone who beats those odds.

I approach many topics this way. Instead of sheltering my kids, I encourage them to take a hard look at reality, even when it makes them uncomfortable and hard to ignore glib and insensitive comments by friends and peers.  We live in very white bread suburb and I feel it is very important for my kids to understand their own privileged experience is not the norm.  It is the exception.",1447804800,,2359,4.389400921658986

Giancarlo Esposito, now known for his turn in Breaking Bad, is electric in this movie. Also had excellent creative cinematography and a sophisticated score by the Police's drummer Stewart Copeland.

Really evil and at times hilarious crazy outbursts that make this movie unique. It's also fun to see Samuel L Jackson as the chess playing father of Fresh. Not many lines but they are funny.
There are so many other actors here doing a great job. The storyline is a good one who keeps you watching it all over again.

628002,5,6303354912,"I remember the first time I saw this film.  My cousin and myself caught a viewing at the dollar theater two months after it came out.  ""Fresh"" absorbed me from the moment I saw the dilapidated houses and bleek environment that surrounded it.  I knew from there that an interesting story was about to be told. And, boy, was it ever. Michael a.k.a ""Fresh"" is an adolescent that lives with his aunt and about 7 other children that she is raising in a project apartment building.  Fresh is fully aware of his circumstances: Hood life, A missing in action mother, an estranged father and a heroine addicted sister.  He has no one.  And I believe that is what makes his character so complex and emotionally distant.  He wants more, but where does he get it?  From Esteban?, the Kingpin who employs him as a drug runner and claims to honor him for his intelligence then uses him to make advances toward his sister.  From his father?, (brilliantly played by Samuel Jackson) a man who's best days are behind him and who catches up with Fresh occasionally in a park to play chess with him as a way of lightswitch child rearing. From Nikki?, his sister, who lives with a small-time pimp/drug dealer and has less desire and emotion than Fresh (as if that's even possible).  Fresh understands all of this all the more after a life-changing incident alters his mentality about what he's doing and what he wants.  He immediately takes his stance against those who have absolutely no love for him.  One of whom is Jake.  His superior in his employment with Corky, a rival dealer of Esteban.  Fresh utilizes all of the components that this life has given him.  And makes a decision that every fan of this film applauds.",1379116800,,1702,4.589403973509934
628003,5,6303354912,"This film was always one of my favourites from 1994, right up there with Pulp Fiction and Hoop Dreams from that year. An unusual thriller with a shockingly original protagonist, Michael (aka Fresh - Sean Nelson) is a wise beyond his years teenage drug runner for two different drug kingpins. He keeps his contempt for them & all drug users in general well hidden, as he stockpiles money for his eventual escape from life in the New York projects. Tutored in hard life lessons and strategy by his absentee father(Samuel L. Jackson), a master chess .player and hustler, he eventually concocts a ruthless plan to take down all the violent criminals who finally bring their lifestyle too close to home. Viewing them all as pieces on a chessboard, the drug lords who would smile patronizingly at Fresh - considering him an intelligent kid but nothing more - will one by one find he is the real predator of their streets, as his plan maneuvers them into death and arrests. Sean Nelson excels in his debut, as a top level student during the day and organized dealer in the later hours, who can threaten without having to raise his voice.

He is smart or he would not be able to do good in school and impresses the head of the gangs to being named number one man on their teams, he is able to play chess that he learned from his father, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson and he is impressive for the role of the boys father, even though a small role he steals the scene each time he is seen by the camera.  The young boy Fresh was played by Sean Nelson now an adult in real life was superior for a child actor and should of received many more roles in the movies.  Giancarlo Esposito plays the head of the gang, who is madly in love with Fresh's sister, who is a drug addict, as well as using her body to get drugs.

A must see movie, as these children deserve better than they get in the ghetto of our cities.

628123,3,6303354912,"This review is primarily to warn all prospective purchasers of several recent Echo Bridge blu-ray editions of fairly good films distributed by Miramax Classics.  To be specific, the films are ""Fresh,"" ""Hoax,"" and ""She's So Lovely.""  Each has the same AUDIO problem, rendering them almost useless to the viewer!!  The picture quality, on the other hand, is actually quite good, but if you cannot clearly HEAR what the actors are saying without jacking up the volume to the highest level (which, by the way, can cause serious damage to your expensive audio system), it is nearly impossible to fully appreciate the films!  NONE has subtitles or close-captions, although ""Hoax"" has subtitling indicated on the back cover but is NOT accessible (manufacturing defect?).

Also, accessing anything other than""play"" from the main menu was almost as useless on all three films, AND I was not able to stop any of the films at any point and return to that point without starting the films all over again (inexcusable!).

At any inexpensive price, no film is a good buy if you have to constantly struggle to HEAR it (unless, of course, it's supposed to be a SILENT film!).

At home Fresh is shunned by the other children in the house because he runs drugs for two drug dealers, Esteban and Corky. Fresh also goes in the park and plays chess with his estranged father, played by Samuel Jackson.  Fresh has a sister, Nikki who is addicted to drugs and is Esteban's mistress. Fresh decides he has had enough of the projects and devises a plan to get him and his sister out of the ""hood"". This is a well written and well acted movie.

Known as Fresh, the young man must use his delivery jobs to support himself and his troubled sister, receiving nothing from his distant, alcoholic father but the occasional chess lesson. His intelligence and quiet determination serve him well, as he wins the trust of his employer and settles into an unpleasant but survivable routine. Even this small comfort disappears, however, when Fresh accidentally witnesses the killing of a classmate and becomes a potential target himself. Giancarlo Esposito (the smooth talking drugs dealer) and Samuel L. Jackson (the alcoholic chess-master tramp) give strong, realistic performances in challenging roles. The other characters (like N'Bushe Wright's portrayal of Fresh's sister) are also incredibly well played, and every single one of them is believable. The script is also fantastic. This is not a movie for those who want the cheap formulaic thrills of violence, sex and guns that are so prevalent today. There are no special effects, no overly violent scenes.

628366,4,6303354912,"I picked it from the library catalog because Samuel L. Jackson is in it. I made a mistake picking it for that reason because he is a minor character. The main character is Fresh his son. Jackson is only in it for a few good but brief scenes.

Fresh lives with his aunt and 11 children (I think they are all his cousins). He is extremely intelligent, perhaps a genius. Fresh is only around 12 or 13 and he wants a better life so he chooses to be a drug dealer. Everyone recognizes how bright he is even the head drug dealer. His sister is on smack and he loves her and wants to save her. He witnesses two murders, one of them is a girl he is fond of. So he sets his mind and heart on revenge.

Watching this movie you think he is a little adult. And perhaps his mind is at adult level. His plotting his revenge on the harmful adults in his life you would think of him more of a grown up even if his voice hasn't even changed yet. But at the end of the movie you realize he truly is a child who did what he did to save himself and his sister.

628367,5,6303354912,"There are no fancy cinematic magic tricks going on in this film, aside from an instance of superimposed images that is so simple it almost seems like a throwback to old silent dramas. There are no choreographed gun fights, no switching film stocks to produce psychedelic effects, nothing like that. Not to say that these things cannot be used appropriately and judiciously to enhance the effect of a particular film, but ""Fresh"" is stripped bare, and must depend on its performances, direction, and writing alone.

For starters, a young Sean Nelson delivers a performance that puts the lion's share of veteran actors to shame. He's completely lacking in self-consciousness, almost like he's unaware that the camera is on him for nine out of ten of the shots in ""Fresh."" His character, for which the film takes its title, may be the smartest youth in motion picture history for whom genius is not a gimmick or a joke (i.e. ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Real Genius,"" stuff like that). Watching him, you see a wise old actor in a teen's body; he does not ""act"" any emotions or thoughts, but merely feels them and thinks them. He seems to embody bits of screen legend: a little Bogart stalwartness there, some of Jimmy Stewart's quiet charm here, and most of all Morgan Freeman's ability to communicate much while doing or saying very little.

That'd be just enough for most movies, but Nelson is backed by a choice supporting cast: the two most recognizable names are obviously Samuel L. Jackson (Fresh's chessmaster/alcoholic father) and Giancarlo Esposito (the slimy, high-living drug dealer Esteban), and both are perfect in award-caliber performances. Two lesser known actors, N'Bushe Wright (Fresh's junkie sister Nichole) and Jean LaMare (as Jake, the hot tempered low-man-on-the-totem-pole employee of Corky) are also terrific in key roles.

The screenplay, by director Boaz Yakin, is doggedly unpredictable, but in retrospect it all makes perfect sense -- nothing in the movie pushes the bounds of credibility. I've seen truckloads of thrillers, most of them are wearily proficient at making you guess what's next. None but a few, however, kept me guessing WHEN to guess, or surprised me with such affecting emotional developments. None but a few moved along with such self-assured grace and style. ""Fresh"" knows its territory, the time and place it's set in, and it provides characters who talk like they do in real life -- not ones that sound like they're in a movie where they talk like they do in real life.

The use of violence is admirably restrained. Most of it takes place off camera, silhouetted, or cut away from quickly. The two scenes of bloodletting, when they are shown to us, are literally heartbreaking. Not only does ""Fresh"" keep us off guard on a psychological level, but on an emotional one as well, something few films ever think of doing.

If I were to offer one criticism, it would be that the chess metaphor was pressed just a bit too hard by Yakin (though the final scene is devastating): we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist, we don't need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room. That's a small quibble, though, because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate, and Jackson's early speech about the game is an ingenious device.",1154131200,5,3299,4.905017921146953

628369,4,6303354912,"'Fresh' released in '94 and directed by Boaz Yakin is a hard hitting view of life in the urban ghetto. Containing all the usual hazzards and scenarios; absentee Fathers' and halfway houses, prostitutes and pimps, drug dealers and the addicted, random senseless violence and the murder of the innocent.

However Boaz doesn't go the route of hopelessness and pessimistic acceptance. 'Fresh' (Sean Nelson) is the street name of a young boy who has fallen prey to all the urban maladies mentioned above. His Father is still living in the area but is separated from his Mother. He lives in a crowded halfway house, works for one of the local drug lords before and after school and his sister Nicole (N'Bushe Wright) is a prostitute and drug addict.

This is not the life this intelligent hardworking boy imagines for himself and his sister. His only release from the hardships of his troubled world seems to be when he visits the park to play an occassional game of speed chess. Fresh is a bit of a phenomenon, beating the older, more experienced players on a regular basis. He's apparently taking after his Father Sam (Sammuel L. Jackson) who happens to be a local chess legend.

When his Father begins showing up at the park to tutor his son on advanced chess strategies the street wise Fresh begins to translate those lessons into applied survival techniques for life on the streets.",1151193600,8,1381,4.794117647058823

While wondering where this film was going for the first hour or so, I saw a bleak picture of a kid in a drug infested world.  But then it takes hold with a vengeance.  Completely surprising and original, I did not find it, as one newspaper reviewer did, ""unlikely melodrama"".  On the contrary, I thought it wonderfully inventive.  The end scene was particularly powerful.  And the violence was not out of place or unnecessarily gory.  For the most part, it was quick and sure.  Two actors stood out, Samuel Jackson, who play's Fresh's father, and much resembles Lawrence Fishbern here, and the actor who played Esteban.  He was very good.  This film was also a pleasure to look at, if such dreary places can be that.  It was crisp and sharp and light, as films should be.  So many are dark these days.  Imagine!  A 12-year-old kid ammassing $5,000 in drug money.  No wonder they do it.",1147219200,,988,4.56
628371,5,6303354912,"Fresh is a 12 year old African-American kid with an abundance of street smarts and a stash of several thousand dollars squirrelled away in an old tin can under the floorboards of a condemned tenement. He's a consummate wheeler-dealer, a drug runner who lives his life on the gritty streets of ghetto Brooklyn. He lives fast and hard and at the rate he's going, he'll be lucky to see his thirteenth birthday.

Fresh's real name is Michael, and he lives with his Aunt Frances, a self-abnegating caretaker of eleven of Fresh's cousins, who have found with Aunt Frances the first stable home of their lives and don't appreciate Fresh's activities risking their stability. They're scared to be seen on the streets with him. ""I'm not going back to no group home because of you,"" one of his cousins hisses. ""If you mess this up, I'm gonna kill you.""

Fresh lives in a world of violence, depravity and despair that no child should ever have to witness. He sits by the bank of the East River and dreams of better things. He looks across the river at the towers of midtown Manhattan, a short subway ride away and as distant and inaccessible to him as the far side of the moon. His world is drugs, which keep him in funds and destroying the life of his teenaged sister, a hard-core junkie prostitute with the face of a black Madonna. His only parent is his dad, a veteran speed-chess player who has taught Fresh everything he knows about the game. ""Your queen is nothing but a pawn with fancy moves,"" he advises Fresh. ""Play your opponent, not the game -- if your opponent plays a defensive game, be aggressive."" And vice-versa. Chess is, after all, a metaphor for life, and the name of the game is survival.

Fresh is surviving as best he can. He's a drug runner for two different groups; he runs heroin for Esteban's Latino crew, and crack for Corky's African-American gang. He's smart, savvy, and above all, he knows how to keep his mouth shut. Something his best friend, Chuckie, has never learned and which will eventually end up costing him, big time.

Survival in Fresh's world is a dicey prospect, and when one of Corky's lieutenants, a thug named Jake, shoots up the playground after being humiliated in a game of pickup basketball by a much younger player, killing not only his opponent but a little girl Fresh has a crush on, something in Fresh snaps. He's had it with all the drugs and the mayhem that makes up his world. Dad's lessons in speed chess stand him in good stead. Fresh sets up a chessboard in his room, each piece representing a player in his world, and with cold, analytical calculation and breath-taking audacity, he plays both ends against the middle, setting the drug gangs against each other and sitting back to watch them wipe each other out.

Boaz Yakin's first feature film is a tour de force which showcases not only himself as a gifted director, but a dazzlingly talented actor in Sean Nelson. Nelson doesn't so much play Fresh as he becomes Fresh. He's such a natural that he doesn't seem to be acting at all. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Fresh's dad, a failed person and parent who has managed to give Fresh the one gift he has, a talent for speed chess that helps him transform his life. Giancarlo Esposito is suitably reassuring and menacing by turns as the heroin dealer Esteban, and Ron Brice is chilling as the paranoid crack dealer Corky. Yakin's direction brings out all the grit, the despair and hopelessness of the environment these people are trapped in, either by choice (Corky and Esteban) or involuntarily (Fresh and his sister). We can only wonder what it must be like to live in such a place, with no way out.

""Fresh"" suffered from abominable distribution when it was first released in 1994, which prevented it from being much better known. I hadn't even heard of this film until I caught it on cable TV one night a few months ago. Since then I've seen it four times, and each time I come away awed at how Yakin has caught to perfection the lives of his characters and the mean streets they live in. And the final scene, Fresh staring at his dad over one more game of speed chess with tears running down his face, is like a visceral kick. Consummate wheeler-dealer or not, this kid is, after all, only twelve years old.

628372,5,6303354912,"This movie is excellent crime/drama tale of crime within the black and hispanic community involving crack, and heroin.  But it is all seen by the eyes of a 12 year old kid.

Fresh(Sean Nelson) is a kid who is a drug pusher hoping one day to have dreams of becoming a rich man off of drugs.  He pushes drugs for 2 crime lords Corky(Ron Brice) and Estebon(Giancarlo Esposito) to get rich quick.  When he isn't hustling, he's a decent chess player but losses to his father Sam(Samuel L. Jackson).  Everything is going slick and smooth for the crime infested kid, but when his friends get cought up in it with devistating aftermaths, he plans on getting out, but how?

This movie is as real as the hood movie style gets.  There is violence, alot of explicit language, a lot of dealing, and realism with the hood community, like crackheads, b-ballers, gangbangers, and so on.  But the one thing that clicks in this movie more than a gun that's out of ammo, is the story.  It has clever plot twists, and it has a good way of executing with absolute supspence and genius(Especially going down to the end.)

Fresh does a excellent job of showing how far young ones back then were willing to go.  While Boyz in the Hood, and Menece II Society only provides messages, Fresh delivers not only a hard fact message, but a solid grade A story with action that suits the timings, for a near perfect balanced movie.  For anyone who loves hood movies, crime movies, or spectacular dramas, this is a must get for you.

628456,5,6303354912,"Fresh is one of those movies that you never see coming.  From the opening credits until the end, it provides you with this deep, gritty, yet utterly realistic portrayal of a youth's mind on the streets.  While our normal society will shrug a struggling African American living in the ghetto as someone without the intelligence to go forward in life.  It is a sad reality in which we live, but it is a thought that goes through suburbia's minds.  This film proves the age-old saying that you should never judge a book by its cover.  What begins as a normal urban drama quickly unfolds into this tightly woven crime story where we have this unexpected hero that arrives from nowhere to pull of this incredible feat.  With perfect acting, the right combination of drama and action coupled with suspense, and a story that literally keeps you glued to your seat until the very end, it surprises me that more people haven't discovered this cinematic gem and attached themselves to it.

To begin, Sean Nelson is brilliant.  I have not seen better acting from a young adult in my entire film life.  Dakota Fanning comes close, but Nelson's emotion seems to be raw and uncreated by Hollywood.  His reactions and passion behind his eyes is intense and compelling at the same time.  You cannot watch this movie without keeping your eyes glued to this kid.  I am very surprised that he has not done more roles that would be able to showcase this young protg's talent.  He interacts well with the other actors as well, giving us this rare glimpse into a world that many of us may not be familiar with.  He takes us away from the clichd child abandoned on the streets with nothing to loose and gives us faith in the family structure and bonds that are created between humans.  Sometimes I think we forget this as we watch our televisions, buy our cars, and spend our money.  There are important aspects in life, but at times our ideas of that can be skewed.  That is what I love about Sean's role in this film.  He defines himself early, and allows us to see his change clearly throughout the film.  He begins as wanting to have a lot of money and power to using what he has earned to save his family and his friends.  There is something redeemable about that which isn't shown as much in films today.

Add to the brilliant work of Sean Nelson are a couple of actors that really played well of the emotional child. Giancarlo Esposito, N'Bushe Wright, Jean-Claude La Marre, Ron Brice, and the unquenchable Sam Jackson are just a few.  Nelson's ability to play off Jackson's intensity with the greatest of ease is just another glowing example of the power behind this film.  You can honestly see where Fresh's talent began with the strong father/son dynamic that director Boaz Yakin has created.  Yakin has crafted this beautiful story of a child's inner demons and desires with the greatest of ease.  As a director, he has pulled more emotion out of these children than I have ever seen with any other child actors.  Where he takes his story is bold and realistic.  The dirtiness and grime of the streets contrasted with the intelligence of this child was nerve racking and intense.  I loved it.  Yakin had to be proud of himself to find such a great cast to work with as well as create this story that could be enjoyed by audience throughout the ages.

Finally, I would like to comment on one of the most important themes of this film that I didn't realize until closer to the end.  Chess is a huge element in this film, and at first you will not see this, but by the end it will hit you like a brick.  The power that Jackson brings to this young boy's mind simply by teaching him the strategies of chess is insurmountable.  While I thought that Yakin was just trying to define the father/son relationship with this game, there was so much more going on underneath the top layer that I wasn't expecting it from this small title.  I think that is what impressed me so much.

Overall, this film is great.  It is boldly honest and originally beautiful (in repetition of myself) that needs to be re-released or remembered time after time.  I am so glad that I discovered it and cannot wait to show it to friends and family.  It is nothing short of the perfect film!

Grade: ***** out of *****",1111622400,4,4274,4.515625
628457,5,6303354912,"The best urban drama of the 90s. Newcomer Sean Nelson plays Fresh, a 12-year-old runner for a couple of local drug lords, who also happens to be a chess prodigy. When the girl he loves is killed by a thug, and his older sister is stalked by a heroin dealer, Fresh masterminds a brilliant, devious revenge. It sounds gimmicky, but the script is so intelligent, the direction so assured, the acting--especially by Giancarlo Esposito as the creepy-suave heroin king and Samuel L. Jackson as Fresh's Dad, a bitter wino who plays speed chess in the park for beer money--so riveting, that you believe every twist and turn in the story. In the dimwitted scripts of practically all Hollywood movies, the hero's ""clever"" plan is so full of holes it couldn't possibly work in real life. Here, for once, the hero's plan is ingenious and airtight. All it requires is lightning-quick thinking, shrewd judgment, and nerves of steel. But these are qualities the young Fresh has already demonstrated in abundance. We believe he can pull it off.

I've seen this film five times now and it doesn't get old. The only criticism I can make is that some of the kids' acting is a bit amateurish. But this is a small blemish on an otherwise great film. The last scene, when the steely Fresh breaks down after realizing what he's done and how he's changed, is shattering.",1109894400,2,1346,4.703389830508475
628458,5,6303354912,"Like other reviewers, I was impressed by this movie -- but perhaps for different reasons.  There are so many things that are well done in this film that it's hard to list them all, but a lot of them center on the film's complexity: the director's avoidance of stereotypes or simplistic characterizations.  As a result, it's hard not to feel ambivalent about most of the characters.  Even the saintly Aunt Frances sacrifices someone else when she feels she must.  And, likewise, the meaning of much of the action is left unclear.  Other reviewers have made some assumptions about Fresh's intentions and motivations that I find myself disagreeing with: instead, I think the director has left them ambiguous.  Clearly, Fresh sets up Chuckie -- but how far did he intend for it to go?  Chuckie was meant to spill the beans, but was he also intended to stop the bullet?  And why, exactly, does Fresh finally cry in the final scene?  I can think of several reasons, each rather different.

In the end, it's this that makes the movie so enjoyable to me.  The director doesn't tell, he shows -- just as in real life, where people don't tell you exactly what they're thinking, but show you bits and pieces, and leave you to put it together for yourself.  The movie's realism derives in large part from this.  You find yourself watching it, trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of a kid with a fantastic poker face, but you never know for sure.

As for the soundtrack, well...it's so different from what you might expect to hear coming out of a radio in that or any other neighborhood, that it seems somehow like the music of Fresh's thoughts.",1109462400,6,1645,4.608247422680412

Then only a day or so later as he tries to rescue his friend he tried to help by pulling him into his world.

Fresh is a very sarcastic, but thoughtful kid that's had to grow up fast.  Samuel L. Jackson plays his father.  He's a speed chess hustler in the city park whose unbiased philosophy is basically the way that he teaches Fresh lessons in the streets.

Fresh plots a brilliant, coldly brutal plan to save himself and his junkie sister from this mob of drug dealers and the impending street violence. It's a very flowing style that captures you as Fresh; this cool street survivor does everything that he has to do just to make it another day.

628461,5,6303354912,"Michael, a.k.a. ""Fresh"", is a 12-year-old drug dealer who lives in a run-down house with his aunt and other orphaned children in a dangerous Brooklyn neighborhood. Having grown up in a harsh culture, he is a boy who shows little emotion despite witnessing the revulsion of street life on a regular basis. His mother is long gone, his sister has resorted to prostitution, and his father is completely estranged-although every now and then he meets with his father to play speed chess, through which he is taught street knowledge. At first Fresh aspires to live the life of a powerful drug dealer, but one day a heartrending incident causes him to rethink his dreams and consider a better possible future.
Directed by Boaz Yakin (who also directed ""Remember the Titans""--a *completely* different film), ""Fresh"" is an astonishingly well-done film that left me stunned long after it ended. By depicting a brutal life through the eyes of a young boy, the film tells a bleak story by taking its viewers on a roller-coaster ride of gut-wrenching scenes, and yet in the process it still manages to engage the audience and finally arrive at a surprising conclusion.
Although the first third of the film is basically used to give the viewer a tour of Fresh's neighborhood, the plot soon becomes very complex after one particular scene. Fresh's life literally becomes a game of chess, represented by the moves the pieces make and the strategy used to stay alive. Despite the film's quiet atmosphere, it moves at a rapid pace and forces the audience to listen closely in order to keep on track with the plot. The plot moves unpredictably throughout, but every one of its elements makes perfect sense after a bit of thinking. And although the script is heavy on profanity, it is totally realistic in depicting the everyday life of the characters, and the dialogue between Fresh and his father during their chess matches is especially good.
The picture is shot on low-budget film, making the Brooklyn neighborhood feel all the more dark and unwelcoming. But there are no prolonged fight scenes, nor is there a lot of on-screen brutality. There are, however, a lot of tragic scenes that really hit home, and they are shot with rapid film editing and camera work that didn't require any computer enhancements. Simply put, no unnecessary visual techniques are used.
The acting is superb all around. Sean Nelson, in his debut role, is stunning as Fresh; he is so compelling in the way he conveys his emotions without having to say anything, and he feels so natural that it seems as if he doesn't even know the camera's on him for more than 90% of the film. For this to come out of a debut performance is impressive enough; but for it to come out of such a young actor is truly astonishing. Supporting roles include Samuel L. Jackson, who expresses a great sense of authority as Fresh's father, and Giancarlo Esposito, who is absolutely chilling as the ""black king"" of the film.
And the ending is unforgettable. In fact, it is not the unpredictable denouement that the viewer remembers best; it is the very last image.  In one final shot, all the emotion that had built up to that point bursts out in a brief, silent moment. It is a deeply moving way to end the film, and it gave me a faint sense of hope despite all the sorrow and horror that had already happened.
""Fresh"" is a tiny film that manages to be riveting, frightening, disturbing, contemplative, poignant, and faintly uplifting all at once, and that alone makes it one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. But with acting, filming, and screenplay all being top-notch without any other frills, ""Fresh"" is also a brilliant work that uses only the most basic aspects of film to their fullest extent. It features many upsetting scenes and is definitely not for all viewers, and due to the plot and script it can be a very challenging film to watch at times, but it is an unconventional example of a director and cast at the top of their form.

At the very least, it doesn't suffer from the usual cliches of such films. Rap and R&B type music is incidental to the plot, giving way to a poignant soundtrack by Stewart Copeland.

Now I've seen ""Fresh"".
I will inevitably rave over it, but the point is that the movie is a true rarity.
The directing and scene editing was seemless.  The coverage of the culture was deep, thorough and accurate.
The plot... the plot depicts a twelvish chess player who has been told of his greatest negative influence by his neighbors and the courts;  his father who contributes not to society.
The great chess teacher rides his son in forbidden afternoons in the park in an attempt to distill ever better stategy in his game, but the boy is thinking of chess in terms of its implications to reality and designs a living chess-like strategy in his life that is desperate and finely honed.
A great artist wrote this film.  A great director executed a fine screenplay.
There is nothing extraneous about this film.
Every scene is essential and delivered purely.  There is no jive, editorializing, propagandanizing theme behind it.  It is simply the real deal and a brilliant young mind surviving in his tough life by using every single one of the tools in his reach.
Like his teacher/father taught him about chess, he wastes not a single move in his life of depraived circumstances of treachery, illicit people and violence.
In the end it dawned on me the awesome tradegy of the role that the father was left to play in the boy's life vs. the fact that he was the only asset the boy had ever has access to.
As the movie closes you see the boy's first tears and its due to the pervasive lie and fraud that has been perpetrated on him and his world.  But the tears are an involuntary response to his father's character.  Even in a moment of more of the same callous criticism of him he sees in his father the constant that has always been lacking everywhere.
The tragedy is that it is far too late.  The world has indelibly encroached itself and the boy will wear his cold, manly armor till death.
His father's criticism in boyhood must have seemed as harsh as the rest of the world.  As though to contradict all the slander toward the father from earliest memory the man becomes a twisted beacon of decency despite the brown paper bag in his hand in the park where the chessplayers go.
I don't review movies.  But I just watched this movie at 3am last night by accident.  I was just checking the weather before falling into bed.  But at noon with my wife today I was moved again and we watched in sympathy, anger and another emotion;  I understood for the first time.
My praise to the director, Boaz Yakim.
As soon as I'm done writing this, I intend to find every film he's ever done and order them.
Other movies I like are ""JFK"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""White Sands"", ""Hoffa"", ""The Recruit"", ""The Rounders"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Glengary Glen-Ross"".
I hope these comments encourage someone to see the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
Oh... the acting is of true quality.

628523,5,6303354912,"This 1994 film is about a 12-year-old African American boy named Fresh.  He's a quiet boy, with large dark eyes that seem to carry the weight of the world.  That's understandable, given that he is often late for school because he's a drug runner for some vicious drug lords.  The young actor, Sean Nelson, does a remarkable job of bringing this character to life.  And, with constantly escalating experiences of violence, the director, Boaz Yakim, creates an urban nightmare of this world.
Fresh lives with his aunt and 11 other children in a small apartment in the projects, which resembles a group home.  His mother doesn't exist in the film, but his father, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has a small, but important part.  His life is already defined as that of a loser, but he keeps his dignity and spends his days hanging out in Washington Square Park and hustling games of chess. Jackson's words of wisdom about the game are basically the only connection he has with his son.
Fresh sees more violence and wasted lives than a child should have to.  Somehow, though, he grows wiser than his years.  And as the plot develops with increasing complexity, he devises a plan to manipulate the drug dealers into effectively eliminating each other.  It might seem a little far fetched for a 12-year-old to do this, but it is done so well, that it all seemed possible.
There are many upsetting scenes in this film, as there should be.  Life is sad and painful for the young boy.  We root for him as he fights his way out.  And definitely can relate to the touching conclusion.  Recommended.",1062115200,2,1584,4.654676258992806
628524,5,6303354912,"In an increasingly conservative world, it helps to look back and see just what those ""good old days"" we're encouraged to embrace once more were made up of. Boaz Yakin's ""Fresh"" shows us just how far we've come and how far we have to go--and I don't merely refer to us colored folk in making that assertion. Sean Nelson's character could just as easily been lifted from an Ellison novel, Grandmaster Flash's ""The Message,"" John A. Williams' ""The Man Who Cried I Am"" or Andrew Hacker's ""Two Nations."" Fresh is the child who grows up to be a Stevie Wonder, an Ice Cube, or the [person] who steals your car, robs you after that theater engagement, and laughs as he slits your throat. ""Fresh"" (the movie) doesn't preach, Yakin doesn't take sides--what he does do is show how hard it is under certain circumstances for a hopeful child to grow up without becoming a cynical man. We should alternate televised MLK and Malcom X speeches with ""Fresh"" on heavy rotation--not during Black History Month, mind you, but every year on the 4th of July. Independence Day, indeed.",1054684800,,1062,4.684491978609626

It depicts some harsh realities facing some urban children and serves as a look at how some people actually live.

Meanwhile, he is illegitimately visiting his father in a park where they play chess and his father teaches him the tough life of the street through the game of chess.  In the absence of a family he is longing for his sister, who has fallen to the power of drugs and affection.  Fresh intends to set things straight and find a way out of the misery in which he lives.

628527,5,6303354912,"Where can I start with this movie...wow it is 1 of the greatest films ever. It truely shows city life like no other films does. I happen to live in a city, a bad one at that Baltimore. And this film represents how city life really is. The actors in this film are extrodinary. First time I ever seen this, I picked it up mid-way thru..and I watched the end and never understood alot of it, however it has such a fast-paced un-boring script and plot I could still get into it, I found out what it was called and rented it. There are very few movies like this..when a movie is unsad plot wise, but still can bring you to tears because it is so raw and real you know its got greatness written all over it. When people come up to me, and we start talking about this movie or that movie and we get on the topic of urban movies there are always 3 movies I hear, Scarface, Boys In The Hood, and New Jack City. But I always recommend Fresh, and after I talk to people after they've seen it they all say this is better than all 3 combined. 5 Stars is a disgrace to this film, it should be 5 Millions stars. Greatest Movie I have ever seen! Please, if you have not seen this film rent it, buy it just find a way to see it..you will not be disappointed! I can gurantee that, it is a great film!",1018483200,4,1282,4.01171875
628528,3,6303354912,"Fresh is a film that troubles the soul and breaks your heart. This violent coming of age tale tells the story of Michael a.k.a. Fresh, a 12-year-old drug dealer who lives in a neighborhood without any real hope, and his struggle to keep himself alive. In a world where paranoia, guns and drugs are a way of life, it is amazing that Fresh not only survives but also comes out on top of the game. Be warned though, you won't like this boy. He does things that can only be described as monstrous but you will understand why he commits the sins that he does. One cannot remain an innocent, a child, and still exist in his reality. Sean Nelson, as Michael/Fresh, gives a brilliant performance that remains understated yet powerful. The entire experience is worthwhile just to see this child at work. Fresh is low budget independent film but boasts a couple of well-known actors such as acclaimed performer, Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson gives a decent, if unmemorable performance, as the absentee alcoholic father who disperses advice on life while using the chessboard as a metaphor. Chess is a recurrent theme of the film and for those who love the game, it will add another layer of symbolic meaning to story.
  However, not everything with this film is happiness and roses. The audio/music track is terrible and disrupts the dialogue. The middle of the film drags the action down and the lack of budget shows in many of the interior scenes. On occasion, the director oversells his message and in other places, I was left wondering why a scene was occurring (dog-shooting). Since this was Boaz Yakins (Return of the Titans) first directing attempt, I can understand where the films shortcomings are coming from but it still doesnt excuse it. Overall, the movie gets a passing grade and I would recommend it for rental. A couple of warnings though-- it has crude language, violence, and drugs are prevalent in almost every aspect of the film..",1017273600,2,1937,4.761904761904762
628529,5,6303354912,"I loved the moive ""Boyz N' Hood"", but I had lots of great things to say about that movie. ""Fresh"" on the other hand was also an anti-hood flick, but when it was over I was totally speechless.
The movies is certainly not for the easily botherd.
We get a real good look at a broken home of pot heads in the opeaning sceens. By the end the film we see the sad effect it, and so many more things have on a young boy. Samel L. Jackson, and Giancarlo Esposite are very, very good. This is one of my favorites.",1016928000,,503,3.99009900990099
628530,5,6303354912,"Fresh is a stark, somewhat sensational metaphor-movie about street life. The main character, Fresh, is a 12-year-old kid with a job running drugs for various thugs. He learns tact and tactic through weekly chess matches with his alcoholic, supposed-to-be absent father. He takes what he learns and applies it toward getting a better life for himself and his wayward sister. Played by Sean Nelson, Fresh is a kid so precocious as to make Haley Joel Osment look childish, and then some.

7843894,3,6303354912,"The quality of acting in this movie is very high, especially in the child lead. And Fresh's expert chess-like strategizing to free himself and his sister from their poor and dangerous lives is fascinating. The problems I see are, first, in a gratuitously violent scene, and second, in assumptions that the sister is powerless to help herself. Late in the movie, Fresh hangs and shoots a dog that he's fond of--for no reason at all except to prove to himself that he's tough enough to do it. But you can be a hard, strong, effective mofo and succeed in your schemes without murdering your pets. Meanwhile, the sister has chosen a life of addiction, serving as the girlfriend of two dangerous thugs, because she prefers it to the hard struggles of work and caring for family. There's no suggestion throughout that she could do better. It's her resourceful little brother who sets out to save his family and defeat their enemies.",1518480000,,926,4.75776397515528
