7884142,5,6305076189,This completes my Red Dwarf Collection! I had not even realized that I had missed this until I saw it on Amazon.  Thanks for the great price and the fast ship!,1299110400,,159,4.129032258064516
7884143,5,6305076189,"Robert Llewelyn (Kryten) hosts the second bloopers tape, containing bloopers from Seasons 1, 2, and 3 of Red Dwarf, with a few included from Season 4 and 5 later on.  He divides the smegouts into animals, inanimate objects, and humanoids.  On the first, he has a very funny comment:  ""we've had chickens that wouldn't fly, rabbits that wouldn't hop...thank heavens we never actually hired that constipated elephant.""  Actually, that would've been a laugh had one been hired.
Of the actors, Christopher Barry (Rimmer) mostly does fluffs and freezes.  The first is basically getting his lines tingue-toed, I mean tongue-tied, saying ""chitley"" instead of ""chutney"" in ""Thanks For The Memory.""  The second is when he says a line, then freezes when he forgets the following one.  Or unexpected things happen, like the hologram ""H"" on his forehead falling off.  Llewelyn says of Rimmer as someone who ""engages in failing to articulate the predetermined sequential order of previously absorbed notations from an earlier inbuilt set of clearly defined collection of verbalizations.""  Translation:  ""he shags it up right and proper.""
Presented in split segments is the ""Tongue Tied"" song Danny John-Jules (the Cat) sang in the last episode of Season 2, ""Parallel Universe,"" and he's got an interesting voice with an unfamiliar range, as Craig Charles (Lister) says at the 1995 RD convention.  And there's the complete, continuously shown smegmix of that song, meaning there is some claymation shots of the Cat mixed in, substituting for Norman Lovett's scenes.
Some scenes from the 1995 Red Dwarf conventions, held after Season 6, are included, where Craig Charles does a darned good poem on the spot, and Llewelyn recounts a funny anecdote involving Charles on a horse on ""Gunmen Of The Apocalypse"" episode.
For the Cat, there's a repeated loop of him fluffing a line from ""White Hole"" where he's telling Lister, ""...conserve your energy.  Stan and Ollie will be back with the supplies...""
Norman Lovett (Holly the computer) is a good standup comedian at the RD convention, affecting that laconic deadpan voice of his, talking about his Cavalier King Charles dog, which has bulging eyes and has a penchant for Marty Feldman videos.  In the segments where he flubs his lines, he cusses the most, from ""Oh bu--er"" to the eff word, bleeped over, of course.  At one point, he says ""Sorry, I'm not usually rude.""  Yeah, right!
Other tidbits include the original opening sequence not used from Season 2's ""Marooned,"" the most popular scene in the series, from ""Polymorph"" no less, and 10-most asked questions from RD, most of which involve continuity errors.
Lotsa fun for the RD fan.",1081209600,4,2670,5.091743119266055
7884144,5,6305076189,"Smeg Outs is fantastic, it is made up of Smeg Outs from the first three series. It also includes the full smegmix version of the Cats "" Tongue Tied"" video. So funny you will laugh until you cry :o) I thought this  one was a bit funnier than Smeg  Ups but they are both fantastic  Enjoy",954720000,4,285,4.053571428571429
7884145,4,6305076189,"If you're reading this, you know that Red Dwarf is the best comedy of all time.  If you've seen the show, you can imagine some of the outtakes they might have.  This is the second tape of outtakes, but it also includes some  clips of a Red Dwarf convention with a comedy routine by Norman Lovett. The  first one, 'The Smeg UPS', is actually quite a bit funnier than this one  though.  Buy them both.",918432000,8,399,4.253333333333333
7884146,4,6305076189,"This is one of the most original plotlines we've seen on television.  The cat is one of the coolest characters that we have seen in recent history.  We use the term ""smeghead"" as an alternative to the norm so that  our children don't get an offensive vocabulary!!!  We are eternally  impressed by the use of the finger in these shows.  Its nice to see that  the rest of the world isn't as ""puritan"" as the US.  The dirty  sence of humor is refreshing.  It shows the true nature of the horny male  without being offensive from many points of view.",912038400,3,546,4.36
