8700658,5,B00T6SZNK4,"A celebration of  the pure ascetic joy of loneliness.  I haven't the slightest clue what this film is getting on about, nonetheless, it feels incredible.  I can't imagine this is much fun to watch on a small tv in your home.  In the theater however, it was a really moving experience.  It begins with some truly infuriating upper middle class granola scum yammering on about absolutely nothing.  After this the viewer is rewarded with utter bliss and torture of solitude, an extended sequence of gorgeous shots of lush, verdant flora explored by the impressive looking main character.  All this is punctuated by an excellent set of transcendental black metal, shot in such a way that one feels as through they too are attending the concert.  Yes this is high art, I don't knock people for not getting into it, but if your into long quiet movies with no plot, this is for you!",1463270400,,875,4.673202614379085
8700659,1,B00T6SZNK4,"Avante Garde film which is unwatchable mostly due to the poor editing. Non-coherent scenes which often linger far too long make this difficult to slog through. It's somewhat clear the juxtaposition being highlighted, but just feels like a student film.",1435622400,,252,5.325
8700660,4,B00T6SZNK4,"Wyatt Cenac plays the satirical speechless lead in this ironic avant-garde art piece designed to highlight the ignorance of hippies in stark juxtaposition with the awesomeness of death metal.  It also made me realize a lot of death metal bands must lip-sync the blood-curdling screams or there is just no way their larynxes could tolerate repeat performances.  Some scenes really try your patience, but I could have watched the burning house for at least another few minutes.",1430092800,4,475,5.1558441558441555
