8319507,4,B001LQQJ3O,"This show is great, and if you are looking for which DVD, out of the many Teddy Ruxpin DVDs on this site to get, this is the one.  It has all 65 episodes of the original series.  Watching them again has been wonderfully nostalgic and if you liked them as a child, you will love them again.

The only problem I have with the set is its extras.  One, there aren't any special features besides the interactive menus and various language settings.  Two, the box that the DVD sets come in is very flimsy and looks like it could break anytime, even though it was new and still in its packaging.  Also, the DVDs themselves come in the hard cases which is nice, but inside, the discs are in separate sleeves that are not attached to anything.  As a collector of movies, this most likely will not be too detrimental to the longevity of the discs as far as I am concerned; however, if you have children I could see theses sleeves and main box getting damaged or lost quite easily.

Even though there are a couple minor problems, this set is definitely worth watching again as an adult, or for the first time for your children.",1268092800,2,1116,4.357487922705314
8319508,5,B001LQQJ3O,"I don't think that Teddy Ruxpin was exclusivley Canadian, but I do know that virtually every Canadian in my generation remembers Teddy and loves him dearly.  The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin chronicle the escapades of Teddy Ruxpin, an Illiop (a walking talking teddy bear), and his friends Grubby, the octoped (a catapillar person with 8 feet) and Gimick, an absent-minded tinker, as they make their way around the fantastical world of Rillonia.
I was worried when I first bought this series that it might be too juvinile for me to enjoy in my adulthood as I've found some of my old favourite cartoons shows do not age well like Thundercats; however, the best surprize I've had while rediscovering Teddy Ruxpin is just how well it is written.  This is a show for youngsters so there is no blood, lots of talking about emotions, and LOTS of singing; however none of the ""pappy"" stuff gets in the way of the story telling.  There is still plenty of action in every episode and the comedic relief provided by the shows arch nemesis Tweeg and L.B. is priceless.
If you're looking for some family-safe fun to enjoy with imaginative toddlers or if you are just looking to reconnect with a truely wonderful and innocent piece of your childhood look no further than Teddy!",1241222400,3,1262,4.7272727272727275
8319509,5,B001LQQJ3O,"What a great TV show. I lived for this sereis when I was a kid, and I am very happy to see it on DVD. Well written and produced, Teddy Ruxpin and friends take the viewer on fantastic journeys and teach valuable lessons along the way. Grubby is the greatest sidekick ever. Tweeg is a hoot, and the songs are catchy too. The only complaint I have to offer is the final episode, in which we are left with a cliffhanger, never to be resolved. Did Teddy find the Lost Relonians? This has plagued me many a sleepless night.",1240963200,,517,4.232323232323233
8319510,5,B001LQQJ3O,"The complete series was a wonderful purchase.  The full series, just as I remember it from my childhood.  The only disapointing thing is that the series ended with more episodes written that were never produced.  The quality of the sound was a little off in a couple of places during some of the musical sequences, but it was a minor thing and I think was actually there in the origional airing of the series.",1239926400,,409,4.5
8319511,5,B001LQQJ3O,"The release of the Teddy Ruxpin cartoon series to dvd has been rather convoluted, with the owners to the rights changing, and it can be confusing about which set(s) to buy. To clear things up: this is the product you want. This contains the entire 65-episode series on 6 discs. It is a package containing all 3 of the Teddy Ruxpin dvd releases by Mill Creek Entertainment. Buying this gets you these three products, in exactly the same packaging, all put into a sleeve:

As for the series itself, it's a given that this is a must-have for any Teddy Ruxpin fan. And for those who are less familiar with the series, it's pretty typical of 80's cartoons, but has a few unique aspects to it. The plot is continuous and develops across all 65 episodes, which certainly makes it a lot more interesting than most other 80's cartoons. The first five episodes (which were released to VHS years ago as a seperate movie) are absolutely fantastic and should be seen and studied by any fan of the 80's. The story slows down a little after that, and you get to enjoy the plot thickening and deepening as it gains momemtum toward a great ending.

Teddy is a great role model for kids and every episode teaches good values. The series is filled with great music and songs, and several of the episodes are real gems. It is very much an underrated show.",1233964800,25,2027,6.2064056939501775
8319512,5,B001LQQJ3O,"Bein born in 1985, I spent my days enjoying great cartoons. Now, I have been on my own adventure: to rediscover the cartoons that I loved so much as a child. I was thrilled to discover that Teddy Ruxpin was yet again available and even more thrilled to find out that the entire series was available as a single collection. Let me say that I was not disappointed after a months wait. The Teddy Ruxpin collection is now one of my jewels in my cartoon collection. All in all, its a quality cartoon, a quality collection and set at a quality price!",1233187200,6,544,4.3431372549019605
