There is an actress whose last name is ""Lord"", but that's a pretty lame excuse for this to be ""classified"" as an item relating to Jack Lord.

Smilin' Jack Martin is a barn storming, old style action aviator whose love of flying is only surpassed by his love of adventure. In 'The Adventures of Smilin' Jack', Jack Martin encounters a centuries old secret that could help defeat the Japanese takeover of China. The secret is a hidden mountain path connecting China and India that would allow the resupply of China from India. Jack's adversary in the race to discover the secret passage over the mountains is the ruthless Fraulein Von Teufel, a Nazi spymaster from Hitler's war machine. The secret pass would provide a safe trade route for the Chinese, but the ancient people that protect it are not willing to give up their secret so easily. To defeat Smilin' Jack, the bloodthirsty Fraulein Von Teufel dispatches her Black Samurai to murder him and seize the passage. The Black Samurai are trained killers, dedicated to their cause and relentless in their attacks, using tricks, torture, and cunning in their attempts to kill Jack and his plans for opening the secret route.

Despite its dated and politically incorrect use of caucasians to play the parts of many asian characters, notably the performance by Sidney Toler (of Charlie Chan fame), this is an adventure with continuous action and a cliffhanger that caps every 22-24 minute episode of this thirteen chapter serial.",1091059200,,1437,5.033613445378151
