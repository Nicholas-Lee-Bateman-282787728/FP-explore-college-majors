4375615,3,B004HGCNBC,This is a a beautiful to look at movie set in lovely part of world. Story ok abit all over the place at times. The actors are all pretty which helps if you like that type of thing. If your looking for girl on girl action its not really the best movie.,1324339200,,251,3.8461538461538463
4375616,4,B004HGCNBC,"As my wife said after viewing this""you certainly know who the snake was in the garden of eden"". Sort of puts an exclamation point on getting to know your future wife very well before you tie the knot! Wow- one guy, two women, what could go wrong? Good story, beautiful setting, but the acting could have been better, more convincing. By the way, regardless of the cover, I would say this would rate mid PG-13. As is so common, the cover picture is merely to boost sales. Don't look for it in the film.",1320278400,4,501,4.340425531914893
4375617,3,B004HGCNBC,"I had never heard of Hemingway's GARDEN OF EDEN and just learned it was a book he worked on for years and it was not published until 1986--long after his death. The main draw of this film is three stunningly beautiful actors in stunningly beautiful scenery. The film is worth a look if only for the actors and the scenery. Although there are a few scenes in other parts of Europe, most of the story takes place on the French Rivera and you can't get much beautiful scenery that that.

American writer David Bourne falls in love with wealthy Catherine and they quickly marry. At first their relationship seems perfect until Catherine's emotional and sexual confusion come into play along with her jealousy of David's writing career. Enter the exotically beautiful Marita and the relationship of David and Catherine embarks on a journey of no return. Catherine all but forces David and Marita together. Catherine's insecurities overwhelm her.

There is an interesting side story of David's childhood on an elephant safari with his father. It's a little insight into his character though we know very little about Catherine's childhood other than the tragic murder suicide of her parents.

Spanish actress Carmen Maura and British actor Richard Grant have small roles in the film and their talents are underused. It even seemed odd that two well known actors would be secondary characters in this film.

The main theme of this movie seems to be the problems of bringing a third person into a marriage. I am sure Hemingway's story was much more character driven. Again, the movie is worth a look because of the beautiful scenery and the beautiful actors but don't expect much excitement in the story.",1315353600,8,1696,4.898954703832753
4375618,3,B004HGCNBC,"The Hemingway novel, Garden of Eden, was not published until after his death. It was an unfinished exploration into gender issues. The movie fails to capture this spirit of exploration and relies mostly on three beautiful bodies and faces to carry us past the contrivances of one character, Catherine. She seems to express her mean spirited alcoholism much better than her sexuality. As in the book, Catherine becomes the wife of David, a thinly disguised stand in for Hemingway. Their courtship is much too short, and their marriage equally so due to Catherine's insistence that they both sleep with a woman she meets called Marita.

If Catherine had been allowed to have a passionate side this movie might have worked. Instead she comes across as a cold, controlling manipulator who treats people like puppets she has purchased. Rather than being passionate about her sexuality, she spends the film acting out various skits with her puppets while drinking too much. After a few of these skits she takes the name ""Devil"", which fits all too well. David's response to this is at times puzzling because he doesn't come across as being as passionate about his writing as he is about the reviews on his first book. He rebuts her insults but does not treat them as the attacks on his writer persona that they obviously are. Until he writes a story about his father, which Catherine savages, his writing isn't really the film's focus. Catherine's whims control everything.

Marita's character is a bit puzzling as she doesn't seem to have any real affection for Catherine and appears from the onset to be more interested in David, even though she is supposed to be the lesbian. In fact if all lesbians were like Marita, straight women wouldn't have a chance! Like Catherine, she is uber rich and could buy and sell David as she wishes. But we quickly learn that she has enough emotional depth to understand both the man and his writing. At that point the movie became very unbelievable for me. It is all too obvious that the only possible resolution is for him to leave Catherine before she finishes destroying him.

While very easy to watch, due mostly to the beautiful scenery, close-ups, costuming and hairstyles, this film fails to convey anything about Hemingway's ideas on gender. It is much more about the musings of a one-dimensional, idle, rich girl. A scene at the end of the movie where Catherine meets a character called the Colonel who was introduced earlier in the film, is to me the most thought provoking part of the movie. As the story begins there is a scene where the Colonel meets Catherine for what is supposedly the first time and tells a story about seeing her starring at a painting of a women in the Louvre. He then tells David to hold her close,""very close."" He also says he knew her father, a ""shy"" man and insinuates that she too is ""shy"".

There seems to be a kind of double talk going on that intrigues the viewer, but it is quickly left behind as the plot dashes forward into a series of superficial interactions between David and Catherine. They are sexually passionate, but again it is a visual passion broken up by Catherines odd verbal insertions. At the end of the film she is seen meeting the Colonel again and he immediately says there is a woman she must meet, confirming that the initial conversation was indeed about her being gay and not ""shy"". Even though little is said, these two scenes make Catherine's character intriguing, because they allow the audience to think. The steady diet of evil machinations that comprise most of the film discourage this kind of thinking. Sadly, the audience quickly learns just to watch.",1306195200,30,3659,4.766561514195583
4375619,3,B004HGCNBC,"This is one of my favorite books and I was anxious to see the movie version. It had good looking people and it was sort of about the book. But the book was about the nature of androgyny, role playing and a woman wanting to be a man because she felt powerless as a woman. The movie was about a threesome. Marita was a real disappointment and David was a bland cipher in no way a representation of Hemingway. Devil wasn't devilish. She had the look, her haircuts were great and she did an OK job, but she just didn't have the sexual spark needed to carry the story. I have no regrets about buying the movie, I wanted to see it and enjoyed it. But it could have been so much better.",1303084800,18,679,4.112781954887218

It was for rent on cable for a while but it disappeared before I could rent it so I decided to buy it from Amazon.  Watching it, the plot seemed to drag but the scenery was great.  I liked the ending.  I think that watching it again will make it seem to make more sense.  I'm glad tht I bought it.",1302307200,,393,3.731707317073171
4375621,5,B004HGCNBC,"Hemingway's book was transformed in a beautiful cinematographic poem... Wonderfully directed, superb locations... superb music... complex situations... what could one expect more?",1295308800,5,179,7.181818181818182
4375622,5,B004HGCNBC,"I saw this film in December of 2010, and I wondered why it wasn't on anyone's Best of 2010 list because I really thought it was the best thing that I saw all year (and I see a lot of movies). Now I see that the reason no one mentioned it was because it was released in 2008 (although I never heard it mentioned until this years 2010 NYTimes Fall/Winter Preview edition mentioned it as if it were a new release).

Suffice it to say that this adaptation is perhaps more whimsical in tone than is Hemingway's posthumously published work Garden of Eden (every moment Richard Grant is on screen is going to have a measure of whimsy) but even with a dose or two of comic relief, this is pretty heady & pretty steamy stuff.

Jack K. Huston (unknown to me before seeing this film) plays a twenty-something Hemingway-ish writer living a splendidly bohemian low rent ex-pat existence in Paris until he meets a wealthy American (Mena Suvari) on a kind of art buying holiday. Once these two meet, the young ""Hemingway"" is introduced to the finer things in life (new sports car, new clothes, expensive restaurants & chalets) but also to a more decadent side of life (as it turns out that his new bride is a bi-sexual gender-bending adventurer). At first the young writer goes along with his flirty new brides games and even dyes his hair blonde to match hers (which gets shorter & shorter & more boyish as the film progresses).  But when these platinum blonde twins invite a third to play in their love games, a struggle for creative control over the relationship ensues.

The struggle over sexual/gender identity & over the authorship or direction of the relationship is fascinating to watch, and the couple's beautiful Spanish companion is really something to see as she sheds her suit & bathes au natural in the cool Mediterannean sea that provides the stunning backdrop to this impossibly lush & lascivious ""eden"". In addition to dealing with a complex & often tyrannical wife, and a complex love triangle/power struggle, the young writer is also working through the central event of his youth which occurred while hunting with his father in Africa. The film thus becomes a kind of double initiation into manhood (and each initiation sheds a subtle light on the other).

This is one of those films that deserves to be seen not only by Hemingway admirers but by anyone interested in complex characters & plots. There's nothing overly literary about this adaptation, rather it plays like a really good mystery that slowly unfolds and slowly reveals the complex psychological events & experiences that shape character's & provide them with a sense of self, as well as with a motivation & purpose.

If the film has a weakness, it's that we are never afforded any insight into the very sophisticated, very complex, but also very conflicted wife; nor any insight into the Spanish beauty who is never more than a phantom, an edenic creature, a vision of physical perfection. But then part of the reason the film works is because it is about the spell these women cast over the young writer, and part of that spell is their mystery.

Highly recommended!!!!!",1293926400,83,3140,4.73992673992674

4375624,3,B004HGCNBC,"i thought this was an okay movie, Mena plays a twisted character, i felt like she had some underlining mental issues lol.  i didn't care for the ending though, i wish more would have happened than what did.  but needless to say i didn't feel like it was a complete waste watching this",1494979200,,284,4.339622641509434
4375625,3,B004HGCNBC,"I should begin by saying that I enjoyed the novel, and of Hemingway's work it was probably one of my three favorite, along with The Sun Also Rises and A Moveable Feast, although I like much of his writing in general.

Having said this, the book itself didn't tell a particularly compelling story, so unsurprisingly the movie adaptation also doesn't. It isn't particularly clear to me why anyone would imagine otherwise and undertake the production. In addition the movie's overall style is also similar to Hemingway's. The dialogue and actions are clear and succinct, leaving vast open spaces between the characters, revealing little about the emotions and motivations behind the actions. The director and actors did an excellent job creating a true representation of Hemingway's work. Unfortunately, Hemingway's novels seem to make for unpleasant movies; I can imagine that a movie adaptation of my favorite Hemingway novel, ""The Sun Also Rises"" would similarly be unpleasant to watch.

What I found in the novel, that seemed to be lacking in the movie, was insight to the writer's creative process. The writing of An African Story within The Garden of Eden was not about the short story itself, but about watching the author work and his attitude toward the characters and events as he wrote them. The book was interesting because it showed a novelist's self reflection on how he writes.

Admittedly, watching a man sit with a notepad and think about his father isn't necessarily cinematic gold. The failure of the film to capture the essence of the book is understandable, but results in a vacuous movie.

On a positive note, a viewer looking to see three attractive people graphically enact a love triangle will enjoy this film.",1493769600,17,1732,5.024390243902439

Director John Irvin would've been much better off with a no name actress with the will to become Catherine Bourne, one of Hemingway's deepest characters.  Though her acting is poor, the screenplay doesn't deserve much credit either.  James Linville's adaptation does not convey the magnificent depth of characters Hemingway has presented nor the relationships between them.  I strongly warn against viewing this film.  The time would be much better spent reading the novel.",1357603200,2,676,5.155963302752293
4375680,1,B004HGCNBC,"Boring to say the least. A complete waste of time. Nothing really happens, and the characters are crazy. The description of the movie does not explain what it is about, and it was not what I expected. Plain.",1353715200,,207,4.473684210526316
4375681,1,B004HGCNBC,Excellent acting but the story was slow and drawn out and the female characters were unrealistic. The husband's constraint and then lack thereof did not seem true to character. The wife going from loving her husband to hating him also seemed slightly out of character even though they created her to be haughty. The girlfriend was mostly a silent observer/participant and her character wasn't well rounded. The movie needed better character development and better flow.,1353542400,,469,5.266666666666667
4375682,3,B004HGCNBC,"A writer( seems to be a successful one, rich) meets a woman. She seems to be from wealthy family too. Fall in love. But she is weird. Well, may be unsatisfied all the time. She is even unsatisfied by being herself. She changes her hair cut and style, her looks. Finally, she adds another female into her marriage. Simply watching this movie, you can tell Hemingway way not stable at all. Anyway, movie is slow pace and really no subject other than unsatisfied woman. There is brief nudity but it also shows missionary position sex. I am writing in case you want to see with younger audience or extreme conservative person. I did not enjoy the movie because it was too slow and it did not even provide a nice dialog.",1349740800,,715,4.465648854961832
4375683,2,B004HGCNBC,"Watching this, one doesn't know whether to fast-forward to the sex scenes or away from them.  A curious mixture of softcore porn and literary highfalutin-ness. I wouldn't necessarily mind either, but not a good mixture in this case.  The book it's based on, though incomplete and not fully successful or ""fully realized,"" is nevertheless much more compelling and intriguing.  Here, Catherine/Devil is just one-dimensional and scary.  (Why would anybody bother with her, let alone fall in love with her?) In the book, however, as I recall it, she's complex; her character unfolds gradually.  Plus you're equally aware of Hemingway's misogyny and fear of women.  In other words, though it's far from a great book, there are depths to the characters that are almost unimaginable from this superficial, facile film.",1349654400,,811,5.248062015503876
4375684,1,B004HGCNBC,"I was hoping this movie had meaningful story, but just porn with stuck up wife of David. The story just plain He was showered up gifts and money, then afterward realized thats not love, how smart!!",1349568000,,197,4.5
4375685,2,B004HGCNBC,"Wow - what a horribly BORING story!

A very odd and somewhat perverted rich and boring female marries/buys a handsome writer. Has sex with him in whatever way she can think of and keeps cutting her hair. Pretty much gets off on shock value far as I can tell - nothing else to her personality really. Seems to pretty much put him down for his writing - something that's important to him and she mostly allows or tolerates.

Eventually she runs into another rich and beautiful young woman with dark hair who seems to be bisexual and attracted to her and her husband both. The wife tells the husband he can have this other woman too. At the end of the movie, the wife takes off and the husband is now going to play house with this other rich woman with the dark hair.

There is pretty much NO PERSONALITY to any of the characters, not much in the way of dialogue or activity. No point to this story.  The only reason I can maybe see this story being famous is PERHAPS that at the time it was written there wasn't much erotica out there. That's really all this story has to offer and it's not much.",1348617600,2,1094,4.270531400966184

4375687,3,B004HGCNBC,"I don't have too much to say about this film other than it was well shot.  Not always the best acted, but the actors do their part and then some.  It's a little overstated here and there, but still competent in the thesping.

I'm not sure I really get the whole point of the story, other than Hemingway's character wanted the vicious bad girl to love him and like him, but wound up falling in love with the caring girl.

I'd not seen the film before, so this is my first exposure to it.  It seemed marginally racy for what it was supposed to be, but it did well all the same.  I'm not sure the sex scenes were really neccesary, and I think a few more intimate emotional moments might have served this piece a bit better, but all in all it works.

I guess I liked it for what it was, but I'm not a big of the film.

A young writer finishes off trench warfare and goes to write in the Mediterranean, where he finds lust and love in the form of two women.  Well shot, staged and acted, very high production values, give it a whirl.

Be warned, this is adult fare.  Lots of sex and nudity.",1348272000,,1085,4.0947867298578196
4375688,5,B004HGCNBC,"Having never read nor even heard of the book, I can only judge the film on its own merits.

I found the story complex enough to be interesting, while vague enough that I could assume or imagine many of the details on my own.

One of the best films I've seen in a long time.",1347062400,,273,3.9454545454545453
4375689,4,B004HGCNBC,"I really enjoyed the book this movie is based on when it first came out many years after Hemingway's death. In many ways, the movie is very true to the book. The locales are pretty much just right and the dialog seems very Hemingwayesque at many points. However, there's something missing at the same time. Supposedly the book was chopped down from the original manuscript fragment Hemingway left, and undoubtedly, this movie was chopped down from the book. It's almost as if you get the perfect taste of Hemingway without the full impact. The characters are right in many ways, but the development of them is a bit abrupt. I also feel like some of the secondary characters were short-changed a bit due to lack of space to develop them in a movie format. Finally, while everything about the movie seemed to be from the real Hemingway universe, Hemingway comes off as very one-dimensional and behind the times. In spite of the very provocative nature of the human relationships in the movie, in the end, it's still a male-dominated world in which the guy ends up being the focal point and the winner. Most fans of Hemingway will want to check this movie out, but for some, it may leave them wishing it had been about twice as long in order to better develop the  characters.",1334793600,,1273,4.632743362831858

4375691,2,B004HGCNBC,"There's nothing of merit really in this movie that you wouldn't more profitably accrue in the book. I was fine with the factual changes they made, conflating some scenes, adding some facts, etc., but there were a few problems I had.

One, the scenes were way too fast. The movie picks up after about thirty minutes and the scenes start getting a little better pacing to them, but overall I thought it was a pretty poorly paced film. I never really felt anchored, and therefore never felt weight in the scenes which were supposed to give weight.

Two, I didn't think the acting was fabulous. It wasn't terribly, but those are difficult roles to play.

I'd say this probably isn't worth your money.
