3085848,4,B00128W9S0,"SWING GIRLS (2004) is that elusive Japanese movie musical I've been seeking which marries a well-made cinematic story with the feel and passion for music that reflect my own developing interest in Japanese pop music. While SWING GIRLS isn't about J-pop, it's about a brand of music that I've listened to for much longer--American big band music from the 1930s and '40s. When a film's got Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Nat ""King"" Cole on the soundtrack, then it's already gone a long way in winning me over.

Unlike other Japanese films about young people and music, SWING GIRLS successfully integrates the practice of the music and the girls' developing love of it into the film's narrative fabric. We get a sense of what the act of playing music means to these kids and why they're passionate about it. And we get to see ample scenes of them in rehearsal, which provide enough of an appetizer so that we're not exactly starving when it comes to the deeply satisfying onstage finale when we get to hear three or four classic big band numbers (including ""Moonlight Serenade"") performed with great verve by the all-girl band (all performing their instruments live--no dubbing).

This is in stark contrast to LINDA LINDA LINDA (2005), another Japanese film about high school girls practicing music, which I saw the day before I saw SWING GIRLS and which took forever to get to its big finale featuring the title song, a popular J-punk anthem, and gave us very little in the way of ""appetizers"" along the way. Granted, LINDA LINDA LINDA was a very different kind of film, imbued with more of an indie sensibility, but I still felt it should have had more music in it. And I feel the same way about NANA (2005) and NANA 2 (2006), two other films about contemporary Japanese girls and music, both of which I've reviewed on this site, that could have used more musical segments.",1218067200,5,1877,4.7370030581039755
3085849,5,B00128W9S0,"Every country seems to have a film genre that the particularly excel at.  No one can touch the US for big-budget blockbusters, China for martial arts fantasies or England for Blokes and Folks.  One thing that Japan does really well is this.  It is a genre without a name, but it always involves a group of misfits and outsiders banding together to do something...cool.  This ""something"" is usually particularly ""un-Japanese"", which only adds to the charm, and can be seen in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>&nbsp;and ""Sumo do, Sumo don't"".

Director Shinobu Yaguchi does this genre particularly well, having previously made the boys synchronized swimming film ""Waterboys"" which was a huge hit in Japan and spawned a TV series.  He uses essentially the same formula in ""Swing Girls"", with enough twists to keep it fresh.  His main selling point was that all the girls play their own instruments, although they couldn't when filming began.  Just like their characters, they master the jazz tunes over the course of the films, and it shows in their confidence and capabilities when playing.

The plot is simple enough to be charming.  A ragtag group of misfit girls in a summer remedial math class accidentally give food poisoning to the entire brass band club when they deliver their lunches.  The sole survivor, a boy named Nakamura, demands that they take over for the band in time to play for an upcoming baseball game.  The gals all pick their instruments, and Nakamura puts them through their rigorous training.  The regular brass band recovers just in time for the game, but by then the gals all have picked up the Jazz bug, and decide to keep their little band together and try out for a Winter competition.  They recruit a conductor in the form of their math teacher Ozawa (played by the great Takenaka Naoto, who should and does appear in every single film in this genre), and hijinks ensue.

I really liked ""Swing Girls"", as much as I enjoyed ""Waterboys"" and the other flicks in this genre.  The ensemble cast keeps things going, without resorting to the usual ""we like the same boy""-type of conflict that usually appears.  There are no villains here, no bad guys to overcome, just a bunch of kids doing their best and having a good time, trying to accomplish something a little out of the ordinary but that they all have a passion for.",1200355200,38,2473,5.066666666666666
3085850,5,B00128W9S0,"In a snow clad small town in northern Japan, a high school brass band (for the school's baseball team) gets food poisoning. The only healthy member of the band (he wasn't able to eat the spoiled food that day) decides to call some indolent girls from the school (who inadvertently caused the food poisoning) to replace the band. Initially, of course, they are a disaster. But just when they start to get better, the original band returns. What's to do, then? What about forming a jazz-style band? Following the structure of his previous film, Water Boys (inept students finally prevail against all odds), Yaguchi made probably his best film so far. It's hilarious, full of great gags. All the actors are good, but the geeky girl named Sekiguchi steal the movie in my opinion.",1200355200,14,775,4.791044776119403

3085875,5,B00128W9S0,"This wonderful film can turn a bad day completely around and make one believe in life again. Bored summer school student Tomoko Suzuki (Juri Ueno from Nodame Cantabile) and her girl pals are grinding through a dull make-up class at their Yamigata Prefecture high school when they notice that the school brass band has departed for the big game without their lunches. Tomoko's plan: get out of class by delivering them! Along the way, the girls bust open and eat a lunch belonging to Takuo Nakamura (Yuta Hiraoka), the band's hapless cymbals player. Unfortunately, the lunches grow too warm during the trip, leading to spoilage and food poisoning for the entire band, except for the lunchess Nakamura. Fingering Tomoko as the lunch-snatcher, he threatens to reveal the girls' lunchbox abuse unless they agree to learn to play band instruments and substitute for his hospitalized bandmates. Tomoko's best friend Yoshie Saito (the lovely Shihori Kanjiya) has her doubts, as do the other girls, but Tomoko sells them on the idea as a means of cutting class for the duration. Joined by food-obsessed Naomi Tanaka (Yukari Toyoshima) and painfully shy Kaori Sekiguchi (Yuika Motokariya), Tomoko leads the girls as they half-heartedly attempt to learn to play. As participation drops, Nakamura decides to reformat the girls into a swing band, but their first attempt at playing together results in a humiliating disaster. No one, including Tomoko, takes any of it seriously.

Until, without intending to, she and the core group of girls discover they really want to play...

The rest of the movie details the girls' harebrained schemes to make enough money to buy instruments, find instruction, rehearse, and get invited to the big regional music festival. As they play more and more, the sound begins to come together, and soon Tomoko and her pals realize that they can't live without the music. They find that they aren't the same bored, unmotivated bunch of slackers they once were. They have become the Swing Girls.

And the Swing Girls are going to swing.

Honestly, if this movie doesn't leave you with your fingers snapping and your toes tapping you aren't half human. Director Shinobu Yaguchi (Waterboys) tells the story in his typically sunny style, with just enough of the bittersweet flavor of small town high school life to keep it real. The funny sequences are genuinely funny, and the actresses are so charming and fresh that you can't help but fall in love with all of them. The romance between Tomoko and Nakamura is subtly and winningly presented. And boy, can these kids ever play! Amazingly, no professional musicians were cast for the film: the actresses learned to play for real in order to be in the movie.

Swing Girls was made ten years ago, and many of its cast members have gone on to be big stars, but the movie doesn't feel dated or amateurish in the least. This movie is about love: love of music, young love, love of life -- and that never grows old. You will love the Swing Girls, and when the movie is over you will find that you miss each of them, the same way you'd miss a real person whom you love. If there is a higher compliment that one can pay to a storyteller, or to a story, I don't know what it is.",1425772800,,3232,4.774597495527728
3085876,4,B00128W9S0,"It didn't match Swing Kids on any level but it still had the qualities that will make me watch it again. It's a pretty good tale, well acted and well produced. There certainly is a cultural element to it which is a difficult thing for many directors to get out of a film without it coming off as corny or trite. This is the rare exception to that rule! It wasn't as dark as Swing Kids which is still in my top 25 favorite films nut that was a different film altogether.

I'm not a real fan of swing music so I'm not really qualified to offer any critique on how good it is or isn't. It sounded pretty doggone fine to me and had my toe a-tappin' a bunch of times.

I'm pleased when I accidentally stumble onto a movie and find that other people have fallen in love with it. There are shortcomings with this movie but I enjoyed it very much and will watch it again. The characters we get to spend time with are basically 'types'. None of them are fully developed - there are maybe 16 band members to introduce - but I still wanted to follow them and I cared about the group. When they are told they don't have to play and express relief then go outside and cry, I felt for them. They got too good too fast but the movie didn't have months to follow them and it wasn't important that we witness every small improvement. There were many laugh-out-loud moments for me but mostly I was smiling through their trials. If I had been at their concert I would have been on my feet clapping and cheering with the rest of the audience.

3085891,5,B00128W9S0,"Many others have described the movie far better than I could, and my words would only be redundant. Perhaps I can add some technical details about the DVD. It loaded up cleanly on my Mac, never asking to ""change regions,"" so it appears to live up to its promise to be ""region free"" (aka ""Region 0""). It is a full 16:9 movie, not letterboxed. It is standard DVD quality, which is excellent, not the highly-compressed, scrunched up junk you find on You Tube.  Of course, everything is in Japanese, so you have to turn on English subtitles, which you do by choosing ""Setup"" in the main menu, select English subtitles, and then hit ""Play Movie."" Off you go. The quality of the subtitle letters isn't the greatest, rather jagged, but still quite readable. The Setup menu also lets you choose between Japanese Surround 5.1 (channels) or Thai Surround 5.1. From this I deduce that the audio is a full 5.1 channels, which should sound great on a home theater system. The Special Features menu is hardly worth the trouble. There is one 3.0 minute ""Behind the Scene"" (sic) clip, but it's poor quality and cropped around a little on-screen curtain. You do get 1.25 minutes of the girls rehearsing, but it's pretty chopped up. Oh, and don't expect to make heads or tails of the cardboard cover that it comes in. Although the printed pictures are quite crisp, not something that was a copy of a copy of a copy.

This is the first foreign movie (w/subtitles) I have ever owned, and I have no regrets about purchasing it. While I  understand neither Japanese nor Japanese life, I found Swing Girls to be very entertaining, particularly when the music starts.",1375574400,2,1643,4.658620689655172
3085892,5,B00128W9S0,"If it does not bother you to read sub-titles, and you love the Big Band era; then, my friend, THIS is a video for you and perhaps your young teens.

Their instructor wants to teach them jazz; instead, what they learn is swing following their new heroes of music: Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, etc.
I had previously downloaded their 4 videos on YouTube and just fell in love with their joy of this endlessly great music. This music will live on far more than you and I. I really don't see, ""I like big butts"" being ""sung?"" 50 years of now; but the Big Bands still will be around 100 years after they played.  Besides the movie with Jimmie Stewart, The Glenn Miller Story and Steve Allen in the Bennie Goodman Story, unless you have the vinyls, cds, dvds or listen to the fundraising for taxpayer paid for PBS; you can get the great ""feel"" of the music through the sheer joy of the Swing Girls.",1368403200,,960,4.333333333333333

It's all done in the Japanese language, except for a couple of background songs, but it does have closed captions in English. The real interesting part of the movie is that the director requested each actor to pick an instrument and they had to learn to play it for the musical features in the film.

I like thousands of others, saw a clip from this movie as a You Tube video of the finale, which was pretty amazing.  But as good as that was, and let's face it, even the best of You Tube videos leaves a lot to be desired, quality wise, and NONE of the Swing Girls postings were a very high quality, you HAVE to watch the DVD to see it the way it was meant to be seen.  And I'm not just talking about the quality.  Believe me when I tell you that ""It's the Story"".  This is NOT about a girls big band playing a concert.  That is only a few minutes of the movie.  Swing Girls is the story of how that all came to pass, and it's both a heartwarming and funny story.  The casting is perfect, and the story genuine.  When I say genuine, I mean that the director actually took these 12-15 girls, who DIDN'T play musical instruments, and in 6 months got them to the point of playing that concert.  Yes, it really is those girls.  (It's not that you take the movie at face value, but if you do some research online, you'll run across that fact.)  That makes the whole endeavor that much better.  I'm only sorry that it took me 8 years to discover this film...now one of my favorites.

3085911,5,B00128W9S0,Swing Girls is a funny Japanese film with English sub-titles. In order to make this film the cast of young girls and a boy had to learn how to play the instruments in a matter of months. Yamaha Music School in Japan rose to the challenge and in the end the girls and boy played big band music like pros.  Too bad they didn't continue playing as a group after the filming and promo tours.,1351900800,,387,4.16

3085913,5,B00128W9S0,"This is truly a very brilliant film.  The story really captures the magic music can bring to everyday life.  It is true that the plot isn't too complex (you won't find government conspiracy stories, or the rising of the Dark Lord), but it is very charming. What is particularly impressive is that the music is actually played by the cast.  In fact, none of them knew how to play and had to learn in such short time for this film.  The actual plot is about a group of girls (and 1 guy) who try to form a jazz band...but none of them know how to play instruments (save the guy who knows some piano).  Thus, the director really captured the true authenticity of the girls' terrible sounding beginning (yes, it really sounds bad when they start out...but good cuz it's a ""natural bad"" - not a proficient player trying to sound bad [trust me, that's hard to do]), to their brilliant finale performance.  It's amazing how awesome they sound at the end...and that is just one more testament to their hard work and efforts for this film.

All in all, this is a heart warming slice-of-life film with much of the humor we've come to expect from Japanese films.  It has a simple but lovable story and characters you can connect with.  It has top notch music which is almost magical due to the fact it's the cast really playing it.  It also captures a very natural look at Japanese school life outside of the bustling streets of Tokyo...in fact more rural.  The girls aren't caked with make-up, the uniforms are normal-cut sizes...it just doesn't feel so processed.  A very encouraging film on how music can change the lives of ordinary people.  A must see for aspiring music teachers, jazz lovers, and people that love films with a good and vibrant look on life.

The actresses actually learned to play the instruments over a 5 month period. They got good enuf to be doing the performances in the movie, and to perform live during the movie's promotion. As a former school band saxophonist, I was impressed. It certainly did sound like non-professionals were on the soundtrack (squeaks, etc), yet they were nice-to-listen-to covers of the old music, such as famous Glenn Miller tunes.

This movie is universally described as a ""zero-to-hero"" film, and it certainly does have all the hallmarks of the typical genre stuff found over the past decades.  Oddly enough, this film, like the better Japanese films, makes you think it's one thing for the first 30 minutes, and then it slowly turns and turns and turns, and subtly you are introduced to a whole new aspect of the film, and the entire story isn't really what you thought it was when it started out.

The dismal turns to beauty, the ugly becomes beautiful, and what was dreary is joyful.

Personally, I was enthralled by the cleverly encapsulating motive for the entire story: one man's love of jazz and his desire for a woman.  Swing Girls won't bonk you on the head with how clever it is, but it certainly has it wrapped up pretty well.  There are a few stylistic elements creating montage of story and time for economy on screen (hopefully forgiven by the audience) and there are a few minor gaps in story that could have been tightened, but in essence, this is a beautiful and potent film above mediocre and in timeless/world-class status.

For a western audience, it really doesn't miss anything.  Differences in culture might be odd, but they aren't major story points (bento lunches, pachinko parlor, school uniforms, etc.).  The writer/director pulled in a variety of passionate and romantic themes like food, music of varied genres, fashion, work, the wild, the seasons, and more, and he gave his film a transition and lush depth rarely found in films.  The broad Japanese character acting my the youngsters is great: Our Gang meets 90210-backwoods.  And in the end, it beautifully transitions characters from their rough, awkward, and lazy beginnings to a happy finish.

And then a 10 minute concert at the end pulling together all the characters and their story arcs.  It's truly a feel-good movie for the ages.  Who would have thought Japan and Big Band could merge so nicely??  I loved it.  Take a chance and watch it.

The DVD is from Thailand.  For some reason this was never properly released in America.  It won tons of awards abroad, but was never sieized on within America.  English subtitles are adequate, but not perfect.",1269648000,15,2264,4.813471502590674
3320345,4,B00128W9S0,"SWING GIRLS (2004) is that elusive Japanese movie musical I've been seeking which marries a well-made cinematic story with the feel and passion for music that reflect my own developing interest in Japanese pop music. While SWING GIRLS isn't about J-pop, it's about a brand of music that I've listened to for much longer--American big band music from the 1930s and '40s. When a film's got Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Nat ""King"" Cole on the soundtrack, then it's already gone a long way in winning me over.

Unlike other Japanese films about young people and music, SWING GIRLS successfully integrates the practice of the music and the girls' developing love of it into the film's narrative fabric. We get a sense of what the act of playing music means to these kids and why they're passionate about it. And we get to see ample scenes of them in rehearsal, which provide enough of an appetizer so that we're not exactly starving when it comes to the deeply satisfying onstage finale when we get to hear three or four classic big band numbers (including ""Moonlight Serenade"") performed with great verve by the all-girl band (all performing their instruments live--no dubbing).

This is in stark contrast to LINDA LINDA LINDA (2005), another Japanese film about high school girls practicing music, which I saw the day before I saw SWING GIRLS and which took forever to get to its big finale featuring the title song, a popular J-punk anthem, and gave us very little in the way of ""appetizers"" along the way. Granted, LINDA LINDA LINDA was a very different kind of film, imbued with more of an indie sensibility, but I still felt it should have had more music in it. And I feel the same way about NANA (2005) and NANA 2 (2006), two other films about contemporary Japanese girls and music, both of which I've reviewed on this site, that could have used more musical segments.",1218067200,5,1877,4.7370030581039755
3320346,5,B00128W9S0,"Every country seems to have a film genre that the particularly excel at.  No one can touch the US for big-budget blockbusters, China for martial arts fantasies or England for Blokes and Folks.  One thing that Japan does really well is this.  It is a genre without a name, but it always involves a group of misfits and outsiders banding together to do something...cool.  This ""something"" is usually particularly ""un-Japanese"", which only adds to the charm, and can be seen in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>&nbsp;and ""Sumo do, Sumo don't"".

Director Shinobu Yaguchi does this genre particularly well, having previously made the boys synchronized swimming film ""Waterboys"" which was a huge hit in Japan and spawned a TV series.  He uses essentially the same formula in ""Swing Girls"", with enough twists to keep it fresh.  His main selling point was that all the girls play their own instruments, although they couldn't when filming began.  Just like their characters, they master the jazz tunes over the course of the films, and it shows in their confidence and capabilities when playing.

The plot is simple enough to be charming.  A ragtag group of misfit girls in a summer remedial math class accidentally give food poisoning to the entire brass band club when they deliver their lunches.  The sole survivor, a boy named Nakamura, demands that they take over for the band in time to play for an upcoming baseball game.  The gals all pick their instruments, and Nakamura puts them through their rigorous training.  The regular brass band recovers just in time for the game, but by then the gals all have picked up the Jazz bug, and decide to keep their little band together and try out for a Winter competition.  They recruit a conductor in the form of their math teacher Ozawa (played by the great Takenaka Naoto, who should and does appear in every single film in this genre), and hijinks ensue.

I really liked ""Swing Girls"", as much as I enjoyed ""Waterboys"" and the other flicks in this genre.  The ensemble cast keeps things going, without resorting to the usual ""we like the same boy""-type of conflict that usually appears.  There are no villains here, no bad guys to overcome, just a bunch of kids doing their best and having a good time, trying to accomplish something a little out of the ordinary but that they all have a passion for.",1200355200,38,2473,5.066666666666666
3320347,5,B00128W9S0,"In a snow clad small town in northern Japan, a high school brass band (for the school's baseball team) gets food poisoning. The only healthy member of the band (he wasn't able to eat the spoiled food that day) decides to call some indolent girls from the school (who inadvertently caused the food poisoning) to replace the band. Initially, of course, they are a disaster. But just when they start to get better, the original band returns. What's to do, then? What about forming a jazz-style band? Following the structure of his previous film, Water Boys (inept students finally prevail against all odds), Yaguchi made probably his best film so far. It's hilarious, full of great gags. All the actors are good, but the geeky girl named Sekiguchi steal the movie in my opinion.",1200355200,14,775,4.791044776119403

3320372,5,B00128W9S0,"This wonderful film can turn a bad day completely around and make one believe in life again. Bored summer school student Tomoko Suzuki (Juri Ueno from Nodame Cantabile) and her girl pals are grinding through a dull make-up class at their Yamigata Prefecture high school when they notice that the school brass band has departed for the big game without their lunches. Tomoko's plan: get out of class by delivering them! Along the way, the girls bust open and eat a lunch belonging to Takuo Nakamura (Yuta Hiraoka), the band's hapless cymbals player. Unfortunately, the lunches grow too warm during the trip, leading to spoilage and food poisoning for the entire band, except for the lunchess Nakamura. Fingering Tomoko as the lunch-snatcher, he threatens to reveal the girls' lunchbox abuse unless they agree to learn to play band instruments and substitute for his hospitalized bandmates. Tomoko's best friend Yoshie Saito (the lovely Shihori Kanjiya) has her doubts, as do the other girls, but Tomoko sells them on the idea as a means of cutting class for the duration. Joined by food-obsessed Naomi Tanaka (Yukari Toyoshima) and painfully shy Kaori Sekiguchi (Yuika Motokariya), Tomoko leads the girls as they half-heartedly attempt to learn to play. As participation drops, Nakamura decides to reformat the girls into a swing band, but their first attempt at playing together results in a humiliating disaster. No one, including Tomoko, takes any of it seriously.

Until, without intending to, she and the core group of girls discover they really want to play...

The rest of the movie details the girls' harebrained schemes to make enough money to buy instruments, find instruction, rehearse, and get invited to the big regional music festival. As they play more and more, the sound begins to come together, and soon Tomoko and her pals realize that they can't live without the music. They find that they aren't the same bored, unmotivated bunch of slackers they once were. They have become the Swing Girls.

And the Swing Girls are going to swing.

Honestly, if this movie doesn't leave you with your fingers snapping and your toes tapping you aren't half human. Director Shinobu Yaguchi (Waterboys) tells the story in his typically sunny style, with just enough of the bittersweet flavor of small town high school life to keep it real. The funny sequences are genuinely funny, and the actresses are so charming and fresh that you can't help but fall in love with all of them. The romance between Tomoko and Nakamura is subtly and winningly presented. And boy, can these kids ever play! Amazingly, no professional musicians were cast for the film: the actresses learned to play for real in order to be in the movie.

Swing Girls was made ten years ago, and many of its cast members have gone on to be big stars, but the movie doesn't feel dated or amateurish in the least. This movie is about love: love of music, young love, love of life -- and that never grows old. You will love the Swing Girls, and when the movie is over you will find that you miss each of them, the same way you'd miss a real person whom you love. If there is a higher compliment that one can pay to a storyteller, or to a story, I don't know what it is.",1425772800,,3232,4.774597495527728

It wasn't as dark as Swing Kids which is still in my top 25 favorite films nut that was a different film altogether.

I'm not a real fan of swing music so I'm not really qualified to offer any critique on how good it is or isn't. It sounded pretty doggone fine to me and had my toe a-tappin' a bunch of times.

The characters we get to spend time with are basically 'types'. None of them are fully developed - there are maybe 16 band members to introduce - but I still wanted to follow them and I cared about the group. When they are told they don't have to play and express relief then go outside and cry, I felt for them. They got too good too fast but the movie didn't have months to follow them and it wasn't important that we witness every small improvement.

3320388,5,B00128W9S0,"Many others have described the movie far better than I could, and my words would only be redundant. Perhaps I can add some technical details about the DVD. It loaded up cleanly on my Mac, never asking to ""change regions,"" so it appears to live up to its promise to be ""region free"" (aka ""Region 0""). It is a full 16:9 movie, not letterboxed. It is standard DVD quality, which is excellent, not the highly-compressed, scrunched up junk you find on You Tube.  Of course, everything is in Japanese, so you have to turn on English subtitles, which you do by choosing ""Setup"" in the main menu, select English subtitles, and then hit ""Play Movie."" Off you go. The quality of the subtitle letters isn't the greatest, rather jagged, but still quite readable. The Setup menu also lets you choose between Japanese Surround 5.1 (channels) or Thai Surround 5.1. From this I deduce that the audio is a full 5.1 channels, which should sound great on a home theater system. The Special Features menu is hardly worth the trouble. There is one 3.0 minute ""Behind the Scene"" (sic) clip, but it's poor quality and cropped around a little on-screen curtain. You do get 1.25 minutes of the girls rehearsing, but it's pretty chopped up. Oh, and don't expect to make heads or tails of the cardboard cover that it comes in. Although the printed pictures are quite crisp, not something that was a copy of a copy of a copy.

This is the first foreign movie (w/subtitles) I have ever owned, and I have no regrets about purchasing it. While I  understand neither Japanese nor Japanese life, I found Swing Girls to be very entertaining, particularly when the music starts.",1375574400,2,1643,4.658620689655172

Swing Girls is the story of how that all came to pass, and it's both a heartwarming and funny story.  The casting is perfect, and the story genuine.  When I say genuine, I mean that the director actually took these 12-15 girls, who DIDN'T play musical instruments, and in 6 months got them to the point of playing that concert.  Yes, it really is those girls.  (It's not that you take the movie at face value, but if you do some research online, you'll run across that fact.)  That makes the whole endeavor that much better.

It is true that the plot isn't too complex (you won't find government conspiracy stories, or the rising of the Dark Lord), but it is very charming. What is particularly impressive is that the music is actually played by the cast.  In fact, none of them knew how to play and had to learn in such short time for this film.  The actual plot is about a group of girls (and 1 guy) who try to form a jazz band...but none of them know how to play instruments (save the guy who knows some piano).  Thus, the director really captured the true authenticity of the girls' terrible sounding beginning (yes, it really sounds bad when they start out...but good cuz it's a ""natural bad"" - not a proficient player trying to sound bad [trust me, that's hard to do]), to their brilliant finale performance.  It's amazing how awesome they sound at the end...and that is just one more testament to their hard work and efforts for this film.

All in all, this is a heart warming slice-of-life film with much of the humor we've come to expect from Japanese films.  It has a simple but lovable story and characters you can connect with.  It has top notch music which is almost magical due to the fact it's the cast really playing it.  It also captures a very natural look at Japanese school life outside of the bustling streets of Tokyo...in fact more rural.  The girls aren't caked with make-up, the uniforms are normal-cut sizes...it just doesn't feel so processed.  A very encouraging film on how music can change the lives of ordinary people.

3320415,5,B00128W9S0,"I took a long shot on this DVD, given I had only seen the last few minutes on a U-Tube clip. The story line is thin, but nonetheless entertaining and hilarious. The last chapter just nailed it for me and even though I can't speak Japanese the English subtitles whilst adequate, could have been easier to read. No regrets in adding it to my DVD library.",1312156800,5,352,4.348484848484849
3320416,4,B00128W9S0,"Silly yet enjoyable musical-comedy about some troublesome teenage school girls who find themselves forming a swing band (ala Glenn Miller) after accidently poisoning the school's orchestra. It turns into the old win-the-big-contest plot.

The actresses actually learned to play the instruments over a 5 month period. They got good enuf to be doing the performances in the movie, and to perform live during the movie's promotion. As a former school band saxophonist, I was impressed. It certainly did sound like non-professionals were on the soundtrack (squeaks, etc), yet they were nice-to-listen-to covers of the old music, such as famous Glenn Miller tunes.

Pretty Juri Ueno in the central role got a ""newcomer"" award for this -- and is now a star in Japan.",1299542400,2,760,5.170731707317073
3320417,5,B00128W9S0,"Well, maybe.

However, my title doesn't totally lie.  This movie is universally described as a ""zero-to-hero"" film, and it certainly does have all the hallmarks of the typical genre stuff found over the past decades.  Oddly enough, this film, like the better Japanese films, makes you think it's one thing for the first 30 minutes, and then it slowly turns and turns and turns, and subtly you are introduced to a whole new aspect of the film, and the entire story isn't really what you thought it was when it started out.

The dismal turns to beauty, the ugly becomes beautiful, and what was dreary is joyful.

Personally, I was enthralled by the cleverly encapsulating motive for the entire story: one man's love of jazz and his desire for a woman.  Swing Girls won't bonk you on the head with how clever it is, but it certainly has it wrapped up pretty well.  There are a few stylistic elements creating montage of story and time for economy on screen (hopefully forgiven by the audience) and there are a few minor gaps in story that could have been tightened, but in essence, this is a beautiful and potent film above mediocre and in timeless/world-class status.

For a western audience, it really doesn't miss anything.  Differences in culture might be odd, but they aren't major story points (bento lunches, pachinko parlor, school uniforms, etc.).  The writer/director pulled in a variety of passionate and romantic themes like food, music of varied genres, fashion, work, the wild, the seasons, and more, and he gave his film a transition and lush depth rarely found in films.  The broad Japanese character acting my the youngsters is great: Our Gang meets 90210-backwoods.  And in the end, it beautifully transitions characters from their rough, awkward, and lazy beginnings to a happy finish.

And then a 10 minute concert at the end pulling together all the characters and their story arcs.  It's truly a feel-good movie for the ages.  Who would have thought Japan and Big Band could merge so nicely??  I loved it.  Take a chance and watch it.

The DVD is from Thailand.  For some reason this was never properly released in America.  It won tons of awards abroad, but was never sieized on within America.  English subtitles are adequate, but not perfect.",1269648000,15,2264,4.813471502590674
8244770,5,B00128W9S0,"A good movie. The comedy is broad and corny, but funny nonetheless. I would describe it as a kind of mild Bad News Bears meets School of Rock. The humor is obvious without understanding Japanese. I'd recommend it for people looking for tween and teen movies, or who want to practice their Japanese language by navigating a lot of slang. (FYI, a lot of people are receiving Thai versions - as did I. The DVD itself is not dubbed or anything - it's the Japanese language film with English subtitle option as you'd expect, just Thai text on the box.)",1516579200,,547,4.48
