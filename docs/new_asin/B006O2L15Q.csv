5008478,5,B006O2L15Q,"If you are a true code lyoko fan like I am, why would you not own this. It includes all seasons of the show in correct order. The dvd's and everytbing about them is professional. The quality of the episodes is top notch and there is no cartoon network logo or anything like that. If you prefere any season over another, than buy them separate but why would you but them separate when they are all avalible in this awesome collection. I first saw this show when I was 10 and I am 18 now and still love this show the same since the first day I saw it. I am actually suprised no attempt has been made to make this into a movie yet. I also can't wait till the 5th season is released this fall. I give this collection five out of five stars.",1343260800,5,736,4.0479452054794525
5008479,5,B006O2L15Q,"I would advise anyone who is a fan of Code Lyoko to buy this series. It is a must have, for all fans. The Code Lyoko series is very enjoyable to watch. Being region free, I was able to watch this series with out any problem. Also being with the PAL format (I live in Australia) I was still able to watch these DVDs perfectly fine.",1341100800,,330,4.015151515151516
5008480,5,B006O2L15Q,"One day in the wonderful life of me, I got my paycheck! And I decided to buy the complete series of Code Lyoko because I really wanted it all of a sudden. I was told I'd get it in about a week and a half to two weeks. I actually got it, FOUR DAYS LATER! I was slightly hesitant when I bought this because it didn't say anything about the language. I was worried that it might be in French. I do not know French.../= But it is in English!
The only downside is that it doesn't fit my widescreen tv. It's basically a fullscreen(square) with big black boxes on the right and left of it, but I really don't care about that. I was just so happy to have it. I guess it also didn't matter to me because I don't have a plasma tv. If you have a plasma and want to buy this, I would suggest watching it on a laptop or a tv that isn't a plasma so the square won't burn into the tv.
I plan on keeping this for a very long time and it's worth the money. To me anyways!

5008483,5,B006O2L15Q,"code lyoko is, in my opinion AMAZING! 96 episodes and a new 5th season coming in fall 2012 no exact date yet though. its great for all ages. actually make it 5 and up. save your money up because i think youll be pleased to see all these episodes. iv looked everywhere and this is the only place i found every episode!!!! so get it before its sold out.",1331078400,12,351,4.101449275362318
5008484,5,B006O2L15Q,"this show was not short. 96 episodes and evolution coming in 2012. It was great about teenagers who discovered the world of lyoko. its digital but with it they save the world with their avatar like characters in lyoko. it is a great show and very entertaining. my personal opinion to this show is 5 stars its super entertaining and was so awesome. Ulrich was my favorite and was the samurai in lyoko. it was funny, with action too. perfect for ages 5-12 and good for any other ages too and personally i don't know why this product doesn't have a billion reviews yet and if you are hesitant aout the price save your tooth fairy money and get this because it's worth your money.",1328659200,17,676,4.416
5008485,5,B006O2L15Q,"I ordered this disc collection a few weeks ago, and I'm already just about to finish Season 1. My greatest concern when I ordered this set was the quality, but I have not run into any problems. The quality is absolutely superb, and I have not been disappointed at all. However, as many reviewers have stated, this set does not come with a jewel case or anything special. It only comes with each DVD season in its own individual case, just like if you had purchased each season separately. One of my DVD cases was also cracked which is a bit of a disappointment, especially since I do not have an extra case to put the discs in. Overall, I find this a great deal and I highly recommend this purchase for any Code Lyoko fan. This set even came with Xana Awakens Part 1 and Part 2, which was an excellent surprise.",1398384000,3,811,4.30718954248366
5008486,5,B006O2L15Q,"I used to love Code Lyoko when cartoon network played it. I would look forward every day afetr school to seeing the next episode and in my head, I was always a part of the Lyoko Warriors! If you are into anime, you should definitely try this series out, while it isn't like traditional Japanese anime, (for this is a french series) it is really great and any anime fan would likely love this series as well. Going back and re watching this, you can see the sort of cheesiness from the first few episodes, likely from them being early episodes and the original creators were still getting the hang of things, but the cheesiness goes away after a while and it really gets good. If you are iffy, I highly recommend this series, it is a fun, intense journey that really pulls you into both the lives of the characters, and the epic suspense that they feel. This set isn't like a typical box set, but instead is the 4 season boxes, which is ok since you get all 4 at a discount than if you were to buy them each individually. Please try get this series, I promise you, you will love the ride it take you on.",1397088000,4,1102,4.252380952380952
5008487,5,B006O2L15Q,"As a devoted fan of the show since it first came out back in 2004, I've loved Code Lyoko to this day. But before buying this set, I was restricted to youtube and other websites to see episodes, with all of their omnipresent ads and crap from recordings off of Cartoon Network, and in some cases, just plain unavailability.

Let me just say, the four-box set of all four seasons, is 101% worth the price. Pretty much the best purchase I have ever made, sending me right back into a happy rampage of nostalgia. Wonderful audio and video clarity, perfect for wasting hours (27 minutes an episode) at a time on your laptop, and not a single blip of screen-eating ads/previews of other shows anywhere. Not even that silly TV-Y7 rating in the top corner.

Five stars, for the product, and for the original cartoon. All you awesome French people with Moonscoop made my childhood, and this collection brought it right back.",1396828800,5,915,4.6419753086419755
5008488,5,B006O2L15Q,"This show used to be my childhood, I watched it and watched it and then we got rid of cable :( Until I had a dream of it years later and bought them!!! It was fun to watch them once more and see one's I'd never seen and being able to finally see what happened in the end; lets just say that when the last seconds of the show came on I cried and waved goodbye to each character saying my goodbyes; that's how much I loved that show. You get to attached to the characters that it's hilarious. I wish there was more but all great stories must come to an end someday :(",1395360000,2,565,3.9217391304347826
5008489,5,B006O2L15Q,"This was a gift for my younger daughter who loved this anime! I was happy to find all the DVDs, and for a great price! They do not come in a box, but it really doesn't matter, when you have all the DVDs! Arrived on time, and in great condition!",1393372800,,244,3.9
5008490,5,B006O2L15Q,"Awesome price for the complete series collection, unfortunately there isn't box, just 4 seasons in different DVDs.
One of the DVDs came in broken DVD-case but it doesn't matter so 5 stars it is!",1391817600,,194,4.735294117647059

5008492,5,B006O2L15Q,I remember watching this TV Show as a teenager but I never got to see the whole 4 seasons because of high school. Im glad Amazon offers it cause now one of my Favorite TV shows can be watched over and over again! The DVD quality is Great and I am very happy with my purchase! Overall: If you want to have a Code Lyoko collection I would highly recommend this Collection as it is wonderful to have!,1389139200,,397,4.102564102564102

5008494,5,B006O2L15Q,"the entire series arrived surprisingly quickly, every disc is in perfect condition, my only concern is that the case for season 3 isn't as strong as the others, and arrived in a broken state, being unable to close, and the plastic that holds two discs in place in that case had came loose from it. luckily i had a replacement on hand, but for those who don't have replacements, they'll have to cope with a broken case for season 3, but the discs will be fine otherwise. i recommend this to anyone who likes code lyoko, and for those who are fans of traditional animation and CGI",1376092800,,578,4.411214953271028
5008495,5,B006O2L15Q,"I would recommend this for anyone who is a Code Lyoko fan. It's so much easier buying the entire series than it is to buy each season or so separately. It works great on my tv and laptop, and I'm really happy to have it.",1369008000,,220,3.911111111111111
5008496,5,B006O2L15Q,"I loved this show when I was growing up and I just had to have this collection! It shipped fast and arrived when expected. I've watched all 21 discs and have not found one problem with them so far!

5008498,5,B006O2L15Q,For anybody looking for a great show this is one to consider.  This item(s) is great for all Lyoko lovers its practically for any age I think.  The minute you start watching it's like you start to slowly submerse yourself in it.  I know Lyoko lovers right now are probably watching Code Lyoko Evolution but I think it's nothing compared to the original Code Lyoko.,1366156800,,364,4.569230769230769
5008499,5,B006O2L15Q,"it was amazing i ordered it on a Wednesday afternoon and it was delivered on the following Monday. defiantly , a great buy for anyone looking for the complete series. The seasons came individuality packaged, each season having its own case which i love. i was kind of expecting it to come in a cardboard box sleve like some series do when they are altogether but im happy with the way it came
the DvDs are in English for anyone wondering if it is in french.
 This is the better buy for the complete set rather then buying them individually.
I am finally glad to have this series in my DVD collection. :)
cant wait till season 5 comes out.

also for WII players i suggest getting Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity.",1365120000,,710,4.371212121212121
5008500,3,B006O2L15Q,"I bought ""this set"" as a birthday gift for my daughter. (I know she will love it!)
The delivery was swift as ever.
HOWEVER, much to my surprise, there is NO Jewel Box!! It came as four separate DVDs. Really??!
Or am I the only one expecting a jewel box for the ""complete"" series DVDs???
This was a HUGE disappointment to me. It is fair to say that the picture on the description page is deceiving.
I cannot say about the quality of each DVD yet as I am still contemplating a return...but I know my daugher will be thrilled if she knew that I got them for her.
It would have made a perfect gift ONLY IF there were a jewel box came with them...",1365033600,4,642,4.103174603174603

5008502,4,B006O2L15Q,"Absolutely love this collection as I long wanted to buy the series as a set. Could had given a five-star rating if not for the video quality which somehow disappoints me to a small extent and also the packaging wise, thought it would be better if they have a cardboard box as a sleeve for the different boxes as it will look more presentable.",1363824000,,342,4.359375
