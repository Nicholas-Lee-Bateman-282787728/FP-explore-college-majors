3992939,5,B002UQBH2W,I have been looking for this movie for years. It's about time it made it to DVD. It's a great movie.,1274054400,2,100,3.8095238095238093
3992940,5,B002UQBH2W,"A great movie. I enjoyed it when it came out. I had it on VHS, but do not have a player. So I bought in on Dvd, so I can enjoy the movie again ith my family.",1262908800,2,157,3.27027027027027
3992941,4,B002UQBH2W,"""...All the Marbles"" for about the first two-thirds is a standard sports flick with most cliches intact.  Even Peter Falk who normally elevates even the most mundane material gives an OK performance as the promoter of two gorgeous lady wrestlers.  The film redeems itself immeasurably in the end with the showdown at the MGM Grand between Falk's Dolls and their chief rivals.  It's a thrill-a-minute affair that's neatly choreographed that'll have you on the edge of your seat.  Director Robert Aldrich's final film requires patience and you'll be rewarded in the end.",1252281600,10,568,5.141304347826087

3992975,5,B002UQBH2W,peter Falk did his best acting in this movie!,1454544000,,45,4.111111111111111
3992976,5,B002UQBH2W,"Absolute great movie. A couple of lady wrestlers struggling along, barely able to make a living. They had to go through and jump over all the hoops to get one chance of glory. Their manager was prepared to do anything for his girls to get their chance at the big time. The lady wrestlers virtually sell their dignity to make ends meet. With dodgy promoters ripping them off and agents doing deals on the side they finally get their chance to go up against the champions. With a crooked promoter paying off match officials it was all against them. With time running out in the title bout all the champions needed was a draw to retain their titles. The wrestling matches were absorbing with no hold bars and the title fight will have you on the edge of the seat. I love this movie and will watch it again. You will not be disappointed.",1454198400,3,833,4.415584415584416

3993003,5,B002UQBH2W,"For an old movie, it's pretty good. My mom says it is a very good movie, and it satisfied my brother because he loves wrestling and that's the movie's inner story and it pleased me because there was a cool plot twist. Good movie",1398643200,,228,4.204545454545454
3993004,3,B002UQBH2W,"This movie wasn't cheep, but I bought it anyway b/c I recalled the title from years and years ago and vaguely remembered some of the story. Well, if there has been a story. Had this one been under six dollars I would have felt better while trying to sit through it and the quality wasn't as good. I have purchased movies from time periods, before this one and the quality was crisp and clear. I don't understand why this picture looks like a throwback, just cause it is.",1394668800,,470,4.3522727272727275

3993006,5,B002UQBH2W,"Let's go back to 1981 and 1971 Caddies! realistic portrayal of occasionally realistic athletic exhibition....B movie acting from most of the cast and A movie acting by Peter Falk (and John Hancock, playing the Mgr. of the Toledo Tigers); in fact, he's every bit as entertaining as a Wrestling manager as a police Lieutenant. (His character at times is more Abe Reles from ""Murder, Inc."", than ""Colombo"". Interesting change of pace at the time for TV fans). His ringside exhortations are priceless.

Burt Young is on hand as a gritty, grimey, and often perplexed promoter; lends some ""Rocky"" veneer to the proceedings. Not exactly a Rocky-veteran at that point, but he breaks thru the screen in his best street guy mode.

around that time Wrestling took on circus proportions yet the girls in this movie are determined to make it on skill. Problem: they are both Playboy pictorial ""material""...well, Penthouse; they proudly walk out into the arena, - even if it at times resembles a barnyard. Falk, too, is outside the box/ring - he is obsessed with classic opera and secretly hopes his ""students"" can absorb the grandeur of grand opera..at least *outside* the ring. unfortunately, at the rate he's going, he couldn't carry the proverbial piano into the Metropolitan.

Good, funny script and tight direction and editing, make it a cult classic.

Mean Joe Greene and Mike Mazurki and Chick Hearn have notable cameos. Technical Advisor: Mildred Burke.",1391731200,2,1448,5.046025104602511
3993007,1,B002UQBH2W,"I was hoping to see women's wrestling, some skin and some fun but  instead movie was boring, status quo up front, everything is fine and no entertainment. It feels like it was done somewhere around 1800 B.C.E...hints of this, hints of that and hints of fun. It actually pretend to show real life and real situations. Avoid.",1389398400,,323,4.666666666666667
3993008,5,B002UQBH2W,"This DVD is a very accurate depiction of wrestling as it was traditionally practiced. The ring action by the actresses was very high quality, and leads to the authenticity of the DVD.",1389139200,2,183,4.75

3993014,3,B002UQBH2W,I remember this movie to have more to it than it did.  Its like they cut whole parts out.  Save your money unless you just have to have for Peter Falk value.,1379721600,2,157,3.875

3993016,1,B002UQBH2W,"Warner archives collection ... Well, I do so wish they had put the right movie in the archive collection box.

3993017,5,B002UQBH2W,I remember watching this when it originally aired on TV. That's back when there was no cable...yes no cable TV lol. It's a decent movie & enjoyable to watch. I'm so glad Amazon has it in streaming format. I bought it the instant I found it!,1374019200,,240,4.239130434782608

3993019,4,B002UQBH2W,"This is a good period piece.  Peter Falk never is always good, as is Burt Young.  The action is  realistic and entertaining.  Laurene Landon and Vicki Frederick are competent and really good to look at. Well directed",1366675200,3,216,4.756756756756757
3993020,5,B002UQBH2W,A great cult classic. Don't recall this being at the movie theatres but saw it on cable about a year after it was filmed. It was based in the area where I grew up. Of course 90% of the landmarks weren't in Ohio back then but it felt good that they had a movie about my area. Peter Falk was hilarious!,1364774400,,300,3.9344262295081966
3993021,5,B002UQBH2W,This is an oldie but goodie movie. It's funny and entertaining and just enough spice to keep you from falling asleep. I highly enjoyed this movie as much now as I did maybe 30 years ago.,1362096000,,186,4.194444444444445

3993035,5,B002UQBH2W,"I remember when the movie came out, then the VHS tape. I haven't seen the movie in stores for years. Even video rental places, it was hard to find. While browsing Amazon, I found the DVD to be reasonably priced. When I watched it for the first time in a long time it was worth the wait.",1351382400,,286,4.035087719298246
3993036,5,B002UQBH2W,"The California Dolls and their manager are upstarts in the violent world of woman wrestling. Harry, Iris, and Molly travel from city to city taking brutal fights for little pay. After winning a non title match against tag team champions the Toledo Tigers. The Dolls fortunes start to change. But as their fame grows a disgruntled promoter and the Toledo Tigers reemerge looking for revenge. The resulting `grudge match' could make the Dolls champions or end their careers.

My favorite thing about All the Marbles was the women wrestling. Vicki Frederick and Laurene Landon are very pretty and took a lot of punishment. There were seven matches in the film (3 against `douche schlepers', 3 against the Tigers, and one mud wrestling match).  Burt Young had a small but cool role. And Peter Falk was great at playing Harry; a know-it-all that surprisingly knew what he was doing.",1346025600,4,877,4.918918918918919
3993037,4,B002UQBH2W,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger so when I saw it was available on DVD I couldn't wait to see it again.  It didn't disappoint, when I was finally able to watch it.  I was disappointed though that the video, possible because it is DVD-R that it only plays on certain DVD players.  When it wouldn't work when I first received it, I contacted Amazon & was very pleased with their service when they sent a new one & had UPS come the next day to pick up the return.  However I had the same issue with the replacement but as I didn't want to be without the movie, I will deal with it.",1312675200,2,595,4.05982905982906
3993038,5,B002UQBH2W,Peter Falk plays a convincing wiseguy type as a manager for a women's wrestling team.  The lady wrestlers are pretty good themselves and display a remarkable talent for wrestling moves.  Its a must see!,1311379200,2,202,4.911764705882353
3993039,5,B002UQBH2W,"This film has two very sexy stars and a finale that is as exciting as any Rocky fight.

3993040,5,B002UQBH2W,I first watched this film back on my parents Betamax video player when it was first released and they'd rented it from a London Film Club.  It was so inspiring to me then and I've always longed to see it again but could only find it available at ridiculous prices on VHS and no good for me as no longer own any video player.  It's slightly dated but I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it over again.,1294704000,,400,4.25
3993041,4,B002UQBH2W,"Gee I had trouble finding this film as it was released in the 80's here in Australia under the California Dolls title.
I like this movie a lot and Peter Falk gives one of his best performances as a wrestling promoter for women wrestlers, fun film for all ages.
