8347334,5,B001WAKULG,"The documentary takes you through the most fascinating places in Iceland with excellent narration and is not drowned out with background music. Iceland is shown in its beauty with waterfalls, volcanoes, geothermal activity like Yellowstone National Park, only it's everywhere and under your feet!!  Reykjavik is surprisingly beautiful as well.  The film; however, is only 30 minutes, but still worth your time and money.",1417996800,2,420,5.546875
