2890170,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I sure hope this release is the beginning of the hope of all ""Stoogaholics"" that Sony is FINALLY releasing all of the Stooges in order on high quality DVD. I find it very frustrating that the hard to navigate Sony website seems to be silent about this release. We can only hope that after years of waiting, that this is finally going to happen!",1184112000,5,344,4.390625
2890171,5,B000SSQ7JW,"At last, Sony has (eventually!) gotten around to releasing ALL the Stooges' films, and in chronological order. I just hope they don't intend to wait several months between releases. The Stooges made films for 23 years and if each DVD set includes just two years' worth of shorts, without a frequent release schedule it could be a decade before all the films are out. In other words: Sony, please don't ""spread out.""",1184112000,70,415,4.777777777777778
2890172,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Ive loved the Stooges ever since I can remember; The first short I saw from them was Men in Black. I do agree this set does contain some classic shorts but the best from the Stooges are yet to come. The best shorts in this set are Hoi Poli, Uncivil Warriors, and Pardon My Scotch. I wish there would be some extra features but I guess the Stooges will never get justice. The menus are boring as well. Stooges need deluxe treatment and I really hope the next sets will do just that.  I cant wait till they release anther set and hope they don't do it every year. Maybe every three months would be good. Highly recommended for Stooge fans who want all the Stooge shorts in order.",1184112000,,677,4.248062015503876

2890287,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I already have all the volumes but I just HAD to comment about how much I love the Stooges. When I was about 8 or 9, I only saw a couple of their shorts on this program on KTLA, so I wasn't really into the Stooges at first. However, they still made me laugh. One day, when I was 10, I started watching this program on AMC called N.Y.U.K. (New Yuk University of Knuckleheads). It was a 1-hour program that showed three random Stooge shorts. The host was actor and comedian Leslie Nielsen (from the movies ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series) as a college professor, who would do lectures on the Stooges before each short began. The show didn't last long, but I have been a fan of The Three Stooges ever since. Soon after that, I would watch their shorts on their website, but the quality was bad. A couple of years after that, I started buying this collection randomly from Walmart and Best Buy. This was the fourth volume that I have bought. It includes classics shorts including: ""Punch Drunks"", ""A Pain in the Pullman"", ""Restless Knights"", ""Three Little Beers', ""Ants in the Pantry"" and the #1 classic in this volume, ""Disorder in the Court"".

My favorite shorts in this volume are:
Punch Drunks
Men in Black
Three Little Pigskins
Restless Knights
Uncivil Warriors
Pardon My Scotch
Hoi Polloi
Three Little Beers
Ants in the Pantry

2890300,4,B000SSQ7JW,"EXCELLENT first disc in ongoing series shows a LOT of STOOGE promise! While there aren't any extras on these discs, they do present the stooge releases in their original formats and running lengths, with crystal-clear pictures and sound, and that is a rarity. On-line comments by other buyers suggest that these are edited. I've seen enough of these features to report that they seem complete - there may be a slight edit here or there, but nothing is evident and any reduction may be only the slightest and simply due to original print damage (certainly they are not edited for their political or social content, as all of the outrageous material seems intact!) Presented in their original release order, each disc is LOADED with glorious THREE STOOGES material and is an terrific way to collect each short by the year of their production. These are also a terrific value (usually around $10./$12. each) and provide a LOT of entertainment value for your money.

I gots my eye closed, ynuck ynuck ynuck...timeless fun that never gets tired!
Have a Merry Stooges Christmas!
UPDATE: My brother was a kid again when he unwrapped and found this dvd. If there was a way, we'd give it 10 stars, for the fond memories of rolling around on the Rec room floor laughing, practicing the Curly shuffle and without a doubt going up to every friend and asking them to pick two fingers. The fun and entertainment the 3 Stooges gave us will last a lifetime! I can't wait until next Christmas to buy him the second volume! Curly Rules!",1356307200,,824,4.38562091503268
2890345,5,B000SSQ7JW,"The beginning of one of the longest tenures at a movie studio by a comedy team (1934-57) and also the start of one of the most legendary comedy careers of all-time, The Three Stooges.

Things start off on sort of an oddball note with the gimmicky short ""Woman Haters""--with all the dialogue done in rhyming couplets. I got to admit, this short has grown on me over the last few years. Sure, the rhyming gimmick gets a bit old after a few minutes, but there is much priceless slapstick sprinkled throughout the short & the song ""My Life, My Love, My All"" is a catchy number--plus the ending with the old stooges is one of the best of the entire series.

The first several shorts of the stooges play a bit oddly--probably because their characters had not fully developed yet. That's not to say they are not good, just different--although the sixth short in the collection, ""Restless Knights"" does run out of a lot of steam after about 6 minutes and struggles to the finish line.

Fortunately for the boys, their careers would be put into the very capable hands of director Del Lord--who I credit with shaping the boys into what they would become (the greatest comedy team of all-time). Their characters really developed under Del's direction plus the shorts they cranked out were just plain hilarious.
""Pardon My Scotch"", ""Hoi Polloi"", ""Three Little Beers"", all classics.

Then we get into 1936--one of the best years of the stooges career, ranking alongside the golden years of 1940-42 and a year featuring all-time classics such as ""Disorder in the Court"", ""A Pain in the Pullman"", ""False Alarms"". Basically every short from that year was good.

Overall, a great collection of shorts and one of the best stooge DVDs you can come by. 5 stars all the way.",1356048000,,1753,4.697068403908795

2890354,3,B000SSQ7JW,"We all know that the Three Stooges is mainly about its clever wit when it comes to the infinite amount of comedy bits throughout each short film in the series. But apparently, the first film, Woman Haters, didn't originally look at that direction. Sure, that comedy is still present, but it doesn't come as much as you'd expect.

Another thing about Woman Haters is that it's entirely rhymed. It's actually very clever, but when it comes to the Stooges SINGING, then it just feels totally weird. After all, no other Stooges film was like this, but the fact just makes the film lose its appeal. Woman Haters remains to be a historical curiosity, and it's only for those that wish to see where the Three Stooges series started.",1335657600,2,725,4.6640625
2890355,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Ya know. When my dad and I have heard about the Three Stooges movie that came out 10 days ago, we prepared for it by watching this collection of the original series of films (By the way - The movie's just as hilarious! Go see it!).

At first, we were a bit turned off, as my dad didn't recall the first film, in which the Stooges are in a club titled the Woman Haters. And there's singing and rhyming involved. I guess this was an experimental film, as I assume they were looking for an approach.

I am SO glad that they went with beating the heck out of each other along with the most clever bits of dialogue/ways. After that film, every other episode of the Three Stooges went this direction. And I laughed nearly throughout every one. The Three Stooges is a timeless series that will never grow old. Moe, Larry, and Curly always seem to have the best sense of humor, as every short film has new (and equally clever) jokes every time.

If you are new to the series, please watch at least one short film. You certainly won't be disappointed. If you already are a Stooges fan, you should know what to do by now. I sure hope you will love the outstanding comedy in the Three Stooges as we did (And maybe you'd get the same kind of nostalgia my dad did).",1335139200,3,1252,4.2521008403361344

to one of them. Truthfully, I didn't watch all of it but what I observed seemed to me amateurish. Their slapstick seems a bit rough, although I understand that this is their appeal and I think only one of the three is a good comic actor. I prefer Laurel and Hardy.

2890366,5,B000SSQ7JW,"The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 1: 1934-1936 is a 2-DVD set showing all the shorts of the early years of The Three Stooges.  The Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly) are comic legends, as anybody who isn't living under a rock knows.  I grew up watching this stuff on TV.  This collection is presented in full screen format.  The picture and sound have both been remastered.  The picture quality in glorious black and white is crystal clear.  The sound is clear as well.  I like all of the shorts in this collection.  These guys came along at the perfect time, during the Depression years of the 1930s.  America needed to laugh at that time.  Really, America needs to laugh now as well, as we're in the midst of another depression.  This collection can certainly help lift your spirits.

My favorite Stooge has always been Curly, but all three guys are great, of course.  From face slapping to head knocks to eye pokes to nose pinching, these guys will entertain you for hours.

The picture is crystal-clear, the sound is just as good, and there are no blips on the screen or muffled dialogue. This makes for an amazing entertaining experience that has me begging for more. I've decided to purchase the remaining 7 DVD's over the course of the next several months. The Three Stooges are hilarious, and Larry, Moe and Curly deliver big-time with some of the most recognized classics such as PUNCH DRUNKS (I especially like when Larry is running through the streets in this one, as he's sped up to enhance the humor aspect), ANTS IN THE PANTRY (my kids' favorite one on this DVD),SLIPPERY SILKS and DISORDER IN THE COURT. The Three Stooges are known for their face-slapping, eye-pokes, and anything else physical, as they frustratingly try to make their way in the world. This collection has 19 shorts in all, and is 340 minutes over 2 DVD's. The price is set right, and fans will get their money's worth with endless laughter with premium remastering. These shorts launched the Stooges into superstardom (though they didn't know it at the time), and is the impetus for the rest of the series.

The DVDs show all the full length episodes in very good quality picture and I would recommend these four DVDs to anyone (and if you like Shemp I am sure that the next 3-4 DVDs will be worth the money too).

The Three Stooges and the Fourth Stooge, Ted Healy had gone their separate ways.  Ted's role was a mix of Mo's leadership without the stooge portion of the character.  He was the ""straight guy"" of the group.  They were known as ""Ted Healy and the Stooges"".
Mo, Larry, and /Curly use stage names for this episode (Tom, Jim, & Jack).  You will recognize the leader of the Woman Haters Club, a regular in many shorts, Bud Jamison.  The conductor is played by Walter Brennan.
For those who like the Three Stooges, this episode should become a favorite.  Plus, you will have the pleasure of a title song to sing along while watching or at a wedding  rehearsal dinner.

Every so often, we set aside a stooge time and are getting through these at a regular clip.

This first volume is when they were hitting their stride.  Curly is definitely the best, and here he is energetic and discovering his voice and persona.  It is a marvel to watch and reminds me of so much.  My friends used play and imitate them, from the sounds and phrases (""move aside"") to, yes, the slapping and poking.  This has the energy of experimentation and does not at all feel canned.

2890380,5,B000SSQ7JW,"This is a review for the double disc set, THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION VOL 1: 1934-1936.
Sony released this first volume of Stooge films in 2007 to great acclaim, just read
the reviews if you don't believe me.

This release was an important event three years ago and here's why:
For the first time, Sony/Columbia demonstrated to Stooge fans and film buffs everywhere
that The Three Stooges were being taken seriously enough to have a chronologically
issued set of their films released to the general public. Much as their more
praised comedy contemporaries have had.  I mean the Marx Bros, W.C.Fields and
going back even earlier, Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd.

You can bet that earlier Stooge DVD releases were money makers for the studios but
this time the Stooges are given respect, enough so that all 190 comedy shorts will be
released in chronological order, using the cleanest film transfers available.

No more hodge podge,thrown together sets, this first box contains the initial 19 shorts
the Stooges did for Columbia Pictures in 1934, 1935 and 1936. And it illustrates
how, after a few experiments, the Stooges settled into a comedic groove that
is amazing for not only its longevity, but for its constant finding  surprising
variations on the  comic theme of laughs as revenge for  those who mistreat you.

Five Stars with pleasure.",1274140800,4,1339,4.973094170403588
2890381,4,B000SSQ7JW,"Sony Pictures goes the whole nine yards and then some in this first installment of The Three Stooges Collection ,Volume One,of all of their Columbia shorts. They are remastered in Hi-Def and I have NEVER seen these shorts looking as good as they do here. What a revelation they are and Sony are to be congratulated in finally doing the right thing in their restoration of the Three Stooges material.
The shorts presented here start with Woman Haters(May/5/34) and end with Slippery Silks(Dec 27/36).Their debut short has the entire thing being spoken in rhyme by the cast and somehow it actually works! These shorts present the Stooges on the ascendance. They of course had been in the business for almost 10 years before they finally arrived at Columbia. They had split with their long time partner Ted Healy about a year before while at MGM.That group had included Larry Fine,Moe Howard and Moe's brother Shemp Howard but when Shemp decided to pursue other things and left they recruited Moe's other brother Jerry(Curly)who was to become arguably the most beloved Stooge of all.
When they secured their Columbia contract they were overseen by Jules White who had worked with them at MGM.They were given some good material and really good backing casts,many of which were to become staples throughout their long career at Columbia. Bud Jamison and Vernon Dent,both previous Keystone stalwarts,are both seen in these early shorts and they be seen in countless Stooges shorts from here on out.
The Stooges humour was kind of a rough house nut type,similar to the Marx Brothers but more physical. Moe was the ersatz leader of the trio,but as much ""punishment"" as he would often dish out on his fellow Stooges,he would eventually get back in spades. They could often carry on with some witty banter also like-Moe:""What comes after 75?"",Larry:""76"",Moe:""That's the Spirit"" or ""What did you see while in Paris?"",Curly""The Parasites,what else?"".As funny as they could sound,their forte' was definitely in the physical low comedy sight gag;no one could ever top the Stooges in that department.
Countless gags were lifted entirely from other comedians of the day like Laurel and Hardy,Keaton and Chaplin. Del Lord,who would become their best director in time,came from Keystone studios and had a wealth of material that was incorporated into the Stooges skits. The Stooges would often barnstorm ideas of their own with the writers,directors and anyone else on hand during the gag sessions. If it fit their style,they used it;some of it worked,some of it didn't,but it all bore the Stooges stamp of approval. A Pain in the Pullman is just a remake of a Hal Roach Todd/Pitts short Show Business,in typical Stooge style.
Furthermore some of the supporting players from these early Stooges shorts rhyme off like a who's who from the Laurel and Hardy camp,people like Walter Long,Arthur Houseman(long time L&H drunk),Tiny Sanford,James Morton,Nat Clifford,Blanche Payson,and others. Also look closely and one can see  stars on the rise like a young Walter Brennan and Lucille Ball and screen veterans like Bobby Burns,Jack Duffy,Billy Bletcher,Clara Kimball Young,Mildred Harris(Chaplins former young wife) and so many others too numerous to mention. A bit of Hollywood history passes before your eyes with each ep and the Stooges make it pass as only they can.
As with Laurel and Hardy's theme song""The Cuckoo"",the Stooges also have their bird theme,a fanciful version of ""Listen to the Mockingbird"".We hear the theme of ""Three Blind Mice"" only briefly,which would become the staple theme later in the series.
Technically brilliant in their remastering of this series,Sony finally re-releases the entire collection of Three Stooges Columbia shorts in what will be eight volumes in all;looking better than they ever have before. The set comes with no extras and no dates of release,just the bottom line. This is your chance to see this comedy team at the start of their long career at Columbia. With a double poke to the eye,a head slap and a hair pull......away we go!",1273363200,2,4055,5.106927710843373
2890382,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I grew up watching these guys, what memories of my childhood these shorts brought back to me. Their antics which they performed in almost all of their movies did not cause me or any of my friends to become eye pokers, face slappers or head bangers. These guys would still be in my top ten performers if they were alive today. The Stooges, Little Rascals, Laural & Hardy and Abbott & Costello all were great movies to watch. They taught us some good lessons in life and did it without hurting anyone.",1269648000,,499,4.434782608695652
2890383,3,B000SSQ7JW,"Being a big stooge fan since I was a kid a long time ago, it doesn't take a lot to please me with a 3 Stooges Video set. All you need to do is provide every episode uncut, a nice clear picture and good audio. I don't even need any extras on the DVD set. And this set does provide a great picture and audio. But at least one episode is cut and that is ""Punch Drunks"". If you remember the episode, Curly goes from being a gentle, inept fighter to a unstoppable champion whenever he hears the tune ""Pop Goes the Weasel"". In fact, Curly will dispense with anyone near him when he hears the music, friend or foe. Moe is Curly's manager and Larry's job is to provide the music, so that Curly can win the fight. Naturally, things keep happening to the music throughout the short. Finally at the end, Larry gets hold of a truck with a P.A. system on the roof (unlawfully, of course) and crashes it through the wall of the boxing arena. Curly hears the music and as the song ends, he has won the fight. It is at this point that the episode is cut because take notice that not only is his opponent out cold on the floor of the ring but so are lot of other people. You may wonder where they came from? What you didn't see because of what was cut out was the following: After the music ends and he wins the fight, people climb into the ring to congratulate Curly. At this point, the music starts up again on the truck. Curly thens boxes everyone in the rink unconscious. But you won't see that because it has been cut out. I remember this episode well, so I readily noticed that it was missing. So are other episodes cut on this set? Only other people's memories could tell us. It was very disappointing that studios continue to put out sets that are billed as complete but aren't.",1267488000,52,1769,4.205882352941177
2890384,4,B000SSQ7JW,"In March 1934, Moe Howard, Larry Fine and the brilliant Curly Howard made their indelible mark on popular culture when they entered the realm of the Columbia Short Subjects Department. Though it took a few years for the Three Stooges to fully hit their stride, this beautifully restored 1934-36 collection includes several two-reel gems. However, be prepared for the musical novelty of ""Woman Haters"" - an inauspicious debut featuring Larry as the atypical lead and tiresome rhyming dialogue. Happily, the Stooges bounced back in their second short, ""Punch Drunks"" (a National Film Registry selection), with the team's immortal characterizations firmly in place. By 1935, Mack Sennett veteran Del Lord helped Moe, Larry and Curly find their slapstick niche in wild classics such as ""Pardon My Scotch,"" ""Uncivil Warriors"" and ""Three Little Beers."" More than any Columbia director, Lord established the trio's frenetic style while making the fastest two-reelers in cinema history. The highlight of 1936 was ""Disorder in the Court"" -  quintessential Stooge madness and the best directorial effort from Jack White. In retrospect, the 1934 hospital satire ""Men in Black"" - the team's only Oscar-nominated short - pales in comparison to ""Dizzy Doctors"" (1937) and ""Calling All Curs"" (1939). Little did Academy voters realize that the Three Stooges were only getting warmed up.",1265414400,4,1370,5.401869158878505

Of course they are stupid and rediculous.  I always thought that was the whole point anyway.  The episodes I have watched so far have been expertly mastered so that they look just like the originals.

I'm pretty sure that each episode I've watched so far has had at least one scene or sequence that no longer makes it to TV.  Not only that but the quality of the video and audio is noticeably improved over what you used to seeing on the old TV versions of their shorts.  Best of all, you can watch Curley episode after Curley episode without having to sit through one with Shemp, Curley Joe or Joe.  If only Curley had taken better care of himself.

Sure, a zillion DVD sets of the Stooges have been produced in the last couple decades, but none in the format that TV fans want...season-by-season (or, in the Stooges' case, year-by-year, as ""seasons"" hadn't even been thought of yet!).  With the release of this DVD volume, though, the Stooges can finally be enjoyed in their purest form...one after another of pure hilarity!

Though it is a bit difficult to describe the antics of the Three Stooges, suffice it to say that they defined the genre of ""slapstick"" comedy.  Mostly, the Stooges' shorts (each ""episode"" runs about 15-17 minutes in length) see the Stooges as down-on-their-luck Depression-era bums looking to do anything (sports, work, marriage, etc.) to make a buck.  Of course, because they are so inept at working as a team, hilarity ensues!  The Stooges were also masters of physical comedy (by far the best that has ever graced the Silver Screen of television), and their crazy slaps, punches, and manic routines will have you marveling at their physical talents as actors.

I mainly bought this set to reminisce by myself, but my younger (10 years old) sister also took a liking to them, and thus we started watching them together on a regular basis.  She loves the silliness of Curly, the cluelessness of Larry, and how Moe always concocts the schemes but mostly ends up on the receiving end of the chaos!

To conclude, the Three Stooges are a comedy team that will never die, but came quite close to fading into obscurity before these DVD's were released.  Now, however, you (and your family members) can appreciate their comedic genius for years to come!

Will you be buying Volume II after this purchase?  As Curly would say: ""Soitenly""!",1226448000,2,1955,4.852409638554217

2890410,5,B000SSQ7JW,"For those of us who have spent years waiting and wondering when the great Moe in the sky would hear our prayers, the time has come.  Finally we can enjoy all of their shorts and not have to put up with commercials or wait for those New Year's Eve marathons.
Each set covers three years of Stooge history on two discs.  There's nothing fancy here, no extra's, no special features, no interviews or commentaries.  Which is just fine with me.  The Stooges need no garnish.
(Except maybe a celery stick upside the head)
The menu set up on the first collection is a little different then the others, but both formats are simple and straight forward.
It's interesting in the early shorts to see them developing and settling into the characters we would come to know and love. We get to see gag's that would become standards in their infancy.  Here are planted the seeds of a million wive's eyerolls and the roots of our childhood desensitization to violence.
But more seriously, there's a reason these guys have been around for over 70 years.  There's more here then eye-pokes and face-slaps.  There's real talent that was honed for many years on the tough stages of vaudeville.  Howard, Fine and Howard genuinely deserve more then a bit of respect for what they achieved.  And finally we get a proper testiment to their legacy.",1222473600,2,1322,4.663793103448276

This set includes some of my favorites, but the first short 'Woman Haters' is only an interesting piece of history and not the same style as the shorts we would come to know and love. You'll notice right away that most of the dialogue is done in corny rhymes! If you've been putting off buying the stooges collections, these are the ones to buy.

I have volumes 1 and 2 and if you or your kids love watching the Three Stooges, then I highly recommend buying these products. Also ordering through amazon has offered great service and fast service, you will not be let down. A word of caution, DO NOT buy anything from the TV/DVD movie store online. I had ordered from them and it was a mess. The dvd's were made up on some computer and then burned and hardly any of them worked and the ones that did work, had no quality to them and you can't return them because it says on the package shipped from China (yea right). In closing this truley was the way to go for me and my kids because they love them also and I plan on collecting all the episodes. Good luck. D.O.",1217894400,,967,4.176470588235294
2890415,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Many positive things that have been written about this set, and I concur: we've been waiting for this for years. The quality of the prints are excellent. The films are hilarious. I could also cite a few negatives which have been mentioned: no DVD extras, no interviews, no commentary, no background material. Just great comedy.

I wish they would have included at least the Ted Healy-era shorts - Nertsery Rhymes, Beer and Pretzels, Hello Pop!, Plane Nuts, and The Big Idea - as well as Curly's ""Roast Beef and Movies,"" and perhaps some bits from the MGM feature films in which the Stooges briefly appeared - Broadway to Hollywood, Myrt and Marge, etc. - not because these are the greatest films, but because this is the closest we'll get to a historic overview of the Stooges' work. And make no mistake about it, these guys are nothing less than comedy gods, and their work is worthy of study.

Let's face it, many of us have seen most of these films countless times. As I grew up they were repeated over and over again, in the afternoon for kids and late at night for adults, for years and years.

What is to be gained by watching them in release order? You get to see the Stooges evolve, to see greatness emerge from, frankly, mediocrity. You get to see comic timing and momentous rhythm gradually engulf the slaps, pokes and silly noises. You see the Stooges go from being the lost kids of Ted Healy to their own fully developed and immortal personas.

As this collection draws to a close, if you appreciate the Stooges at all, you will cheer. You will find yourself giggling and clapping, for Curly -- who taunts us in the beginning with his quiet demeanor and jerky movements -- Curly, who will become the most fondly remembered comedians of all time -- the full Curly has arrived.",1217635200,,1787,4.575

You can't go directly to about the last half of the shorts without either hitting the 'FastForward' or 'Skip' button on your DVD player or choosing 'Play All' and letting them all run through.

Roughly half-way through the short, the Stooges are on the golf course and a golfer is accusing the Stooges of stealing his ball...  Moe accuses Curly of the theft, Curly protests, Moe smacks Curly on his head, and then we jump to the next scene.

The very funny conclusion of that scene where Curly gets smacked by Moe - Curly does a little dance and hundreds of golf balls jump from Curly's pockets - is missing from the DVD version before this one.

I'm concerned that there may be more episodes with missing bits like this.

2890447,5,B000SSQ7JW,"As a child of the early 1970's, I would zone out from the rigors of elementary school by wasting endless hours watching the ""b**b tube"" (my Mother's words). Nope, no ""fresh air"" for me! Just good ol' mind destroying TV! The local Baltimore TV station I watched, had a kiddie show host named, Captain Chesapeake. He would introduce the likes of 'Speed Racer', 'Popeye the Sailor' and 'The Little Rascals'. But my favorites on the bill were always seeing the slapstick antics of 'The Three Stooges'. I couldn't get enough of Moe, Larry & Curly (and sometimes Shemp) as they slapped, bonked and ""nyuk-nyuked"" their way through hundreds of hilarious, classic, B&W comedy shorts from the past.

Fast forward, over thirty-five years later. I'm now a middle-aged dad with a rug-rat of my own. My six year old son is being brought up right, with liberal doses of 'Abbott & Costello' and 'the Marx Brothers'. I wanted to introduce him to 'The Three Stooges', but they were hard to find on cable. Even worst, I couldn't seem to get myself to invest in the DVD 'Stooge' compilations that were currently on the market. They just seemed so darn CR**PY in how they were presented and put together! (Don't even get me started on the subject of 'Stooge' colorization!) This situation was a slap in the face (PUN INTENDED!) to 'Stooge' fans everywhere!

But now this injustice has been undone with the Sony Pictures DVD release of ""The Three Stooges Collection, Volume One:1934-1936"". This DVD collection gives the 'Stooges' the treatment they truely deserve. The three disc set, features nineteen digtally remastered Columbia Pictures shorts, all in their original theatrical release order. This is like ""mannah"" from comedy heaven! The remastering is brilliant. The B&W images are crystal clear. I Love watching classic comedy titles such as ""Punch Drunks"", ""Men In Black"", ""Three Little Beers"" and ""Disorder in the Court"". These shorts are just filled with hilarious, gut-busting, classic comedy material.

Also this DVD collection really puts the 'The Three Stooges' early career into perspective. While these shorts are hardly the first time the 'Stooges' were on film, it seems like you are watching the early evolution of their characters from short to short.(Curly seems to really stand-up and get into Moe's face!) The boys seem to be experimenting around, finding and perfecting their slapstick comedy style. Furthermore,it dawns on me how the 'Stooges' could just jump from genre to genre and satirize westerns, mysteries, Courtroom dramas, medieval epics ETC. They even seem to take on the current issues of the day, including unemployment, bootlegging and illegal sports betting. All with a pie in the face!

But enough of this attempt at ""fancy-pants"" analysis. All I really know is that now, every Saturday morning, my six year old wakes me up (way to early) to sit on the couch, eat 'Cocoa Puffs' and laugh our b**ts off watching Moe, Larry and Curly! The six year old has even tried to give me the 'Stooge' eye gouge (but I have my defenses)! Ahhh, they learn so young...",1206057600,2,3071,4.957281553398058
2890448,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I know that there are no extras, but please be thankful that the shorts have been put on dvd in excellent condition and in sequence of release. With the disgraceful way Laurel and Hardy and the Our Gang/Little Rascals are treated in the U.S., we're lucky to have the start of the Stooges on dvd.
Watching them in sequence allows us to see them progress to the expert level of timing they eventually arrive at. It appears to me that by ""Three Little Beers,"" the Stooges found their groove although all the preceeding ones are still good. I will always prefer the original title card with their larger images as seen in most of this set.
Larry is often left out of the conversation but he is absolutely funny in his own right. Where Moe and Curly are extremes, Larry has the components of both which in turn makes him more of the everyman. He's the most ""normal"" which adds a dimension to those moments where he is on the receiving end of whatever comes his way.

Its stated as being remastered in HD, and on my video-upscaling DVD player, it looks might sharp and fine (a bit of softness in the corners in some shorts is nothing serious). for the comedic value, there are some fine videos in there (Disorder in the Court is a classic) but some shorts (the first few) are rather toned-down - its quite slow-paced and lack the signature slapstick but the later shorts are fine. I guess it depends on who's the director/producer/writer for each video. A worthy title to add to any 3 Stooges fan's collection.",1205193600,2,720,4.677165354330708

It pleases me that my kids also love watching grown men with less sense and forethought than their grade school buddies acting out against the world they cannot comprehend.

3 Stooges' comedies resonate a certain longing within anyone who has ever wanted to lash against the arbitrary mores of society. Oh, to blindly rush forward and carve out our own weird, little chunk of reality and emphasize it with a well-placed eye poke.

Yeah, it would have been nice to have some extras tacked on but I will gladly settle for this! Can't wait for the rest of the series !!!",1205107200,,683,4.544715447154472

2890453,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Yeah, it's *that* good!  Picture quality is amazing for films of this vintage with hiss-free audio as a bonus! They look and sound as if they could have been made ""yesterday"".  There *is* some occasional streaking and noticeable graininess in a few scenes of a few shorts, but this occurs only occasionally in only a scene or two at most. Considering that this is only for brief segments I assume this is the way they were when originally presented.  The only exception is ""Whoops, I'm an Indian!"" which is fairly grainy all the way through, but still more than acceptable.  If you did not see this short bumpered with the others you would probably not give this much attention.

The shorts are uncut with many beginning with a few seconds of footage of the National Recovery Act (NRA) logos and/or music preceding Columbia's ""torch lady"" logo which has not been seen or heard in years. The few seconds of Curly footage missing from the previous DVD release of ""Three Little Beers"" has been reinstated.

I've never seen ""Disorder in the Court"" looking better. It is one of those that fell into public domain and is available at every quick shop for a dollar or two.  It has been almost unwatchable on those releases.  Here it looks and sounds almost new.

There are no bonus features of any kind.  English is the only language with English ""closed captioning"" available, but no sub-titles.  This is a step down from previous releases, but most will probably not notice or care.

Several of the shorts in this collection are new to DVD. They are:
""Horses' Collars""
""Uncivil Warriors""
""Pardon My Scotch""
""Ants in the Pantry""
""Movie Maniacs""
""Half Shot Shooters""
""A Pain in the Pullman""
""Slippery Silks""

Considering that's more shorts than appear on many previous Stooges' releases makes this set worth the purchase for those alone even if you own previous sets. Add in the outstanding quality and it's a real no-brainer.",1204329600,4,1919,4.796352583586626
2890454,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I had my greatest and first exposure to the comedy of The Three Stooges when I was in elementary school. They were on every morning before school as part of Icky Twerp's Slam Bang Theatre on KTVT in Ft. Worth, Tx back in the 1960's. After I grew up, I was often told by men that as a woman it was unnatural that I ""got"" the Stooges. However, I've always thought they were the best at modern slapstick and - maybe just a little - they are the reason I understand men so well. Every now and then men like to get together, put on their Viking hats, slog some ale, sing manly songs, and behave in a completely uncivilized but relatively harmless manner. This is the basis of the Stooges' act.

Basically, the humor of the Stooges has a two-pronged approach. In the foreground, their humor just consists of good old-fashioned slapstick. However, in the background, there is a bit of sly social commentary going on. Like the Marx Bros., they behave so outrageously and incompetently that anyone should be able to see that they shouldn't have the positions they claim to have - as doctors in ""Men in Black"", as filmmakers in ""Movie Maniacs"", as artists in ""Pop Goes the Easel"", or as exterminators in ""Ants in the Pantry"". However, the society types that surround them would rather remain safe in their pretentiousness than step out and call attention to themselves and say ""These guys don't know what they're talking about!"". To do so might upset the entire social order. Thus the Stooges are given a free hand to run amok until they destroy everything. THEN everyone complains. In that sense, it seems like society hasn't changed in the 75 years since the Stooges first formed their act.

These early shorts are among my favorites. The oldest short, ""Woman Haters"", is different from all the others in that everyone sings or rhymes their part. You'll also notice a couple of supporting players that may be familiar - Lucille Ball shows up in 1934's ""Three Little Pigskins"" and Walter Brennan in ""Restless Knights"" and ""Woman Haters"". The audio and video are of the highest quality. I couldn't see any of the wires that enabled the stunts as other viewers claim to have seen, but then at 50 my eyesight isn't what it once was plus I'm viewing on a standard sized TV. The only bad thing I can say about this set is that it has absolutely no extras. Since Columbia provided commentary on Buster Keaton's much less feted DVD set of shorts, you'd think that the studio's busiest comedians of the 30's and 40's would warrant something along those lines. However, I still highly recommend the set and hope that more Stooges DVD sets are forthcoming.",1204243200,3,2637,4.632478632478633

2890469,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Finally, it's what all loyal Three Stooges fans have been waiting for...the Columbia shorts, in chronological order, released on DVD.  And, the more demanding among us might also have wished for a wonderfully cleaned up showing of the shorts, in gloriously restored black and white. I can say, at least in my opinion, all these demands are met with this SONY release of ""The Three Stooges Collection Volume One: 1934-1936"". The shorts look better than any other prior release. They were meticulously cleaned up, making the images incredibly sharp - down to seeing every ringlet of Larry Fine's frizzy top - and the sound and picture quality are absolutely pristine. In terms of content, this two disk set supplies some of the best and most classic shorts from Moe, Larry, and Curly.  It begins with their first short, a musical novelty called ""Woman Haters"", in which Larry is given the unlikely leading role - something that should have happened a lot more in my opinion. He turns in a charming performance, as they all do, showing that their comedy works well even in such a styled, rhymed, affair. However, with their second short ""Punch Drunks"" (which Howard, Fine, and Howard scripted), and those that follow, the boys hit their stride and develop into more recognizable characters: Moe and Curly at two polar opposite sides of the spectrum and Larry as the mutable middle man.  Other great shorts on the disks include ""Men in Black"", ""Uncivil Warriors"", ""Movie Maniacs"", ""Three Little Pigskins"", ""Three Little Beers"", ""Ants in the Pantry"", and ""Disorder in the Court"".  This collection is a must for any fan of the comedy trio who, until recently, has not gotten the attention as such teams as the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy in terms of DVD collections. So, for those of you with good taste, buy this set, sit back, and watch the genius of the Three Stooges shorts like you've never seen them before.

Luckily the slap stick comedy did not intergrate into my real life as I was growing up as I left the antics for the tv screen.

This DVD collection has been a dream come true for myself and my father.  Before he passed, he want to chronological the episodes, which when we discussed it sometime ago was going to be accomplished by splicing VHS tapes (he had a video editor).

2890478,5,B000SSQ7JW,"It might have taken a really long time for Columbia to finally issue Stooge shorts on DVD properly, in a way that fans wanted (chronologically and in black and white), but in the end the extremely long wait was worth it.  I know some people initially feared this set might not sell as optimally as it could have five or seven years ago, when the Stooges were last regularly shown on television and thus in the minds of more people, but it appears those fears were unfounded.  These shorts have never looked better; it's a huge upgrade in quality from the old VHS collections and the prints used on a lot of the older DVDs.  The only short whose quality isn't a big improvement is 'Whoops, I'm an Indian!' (which isn't one of my favorites anyway).  For some reason, the print used is darker than the nice one used when it was issued on DVD before.  Though apart from that, the set is perfect.  They even used a complete print of 'Three Little Beers,' so much better than the previous DVD version that had a brief section of footage missing.

While I'm sure it is painful on one's wallet if one has already bought all of the previous ""themed"" discs and now has to start all over again, the extra money is really worth it.  This two-disc set provides a LOT more shorts per buck than any of the previous discs did, in mostly all pristine quality, and finally with a ""play all"" option, something most of the other discs didn't have.  Eight of the twenty-one shorts have never been issued on DVD before.  I also love how the discs are stored in individual thin boxes instead of stacked overlapping one another or just in one regular-sized DVD box.  It would have been great had there been some bonus material, but I agree that they're probably saving it for the later sets that will cover the later Shemp era and the Joe Besser era, to help to up their sales potential.

This very early Stooge era isn't quite my favorite because they hadn't really fully establised their screen characters, screen relationship, or the specific type of comedy they wanted to concentrate on (all of the ingredients are there, but just not brought to perfection just yet), but I do love a lot of these shorts.  In spite of the fact that this is a bit before their classic era really started, there's a sort of charm and magic in watching the chaotic freewheeling spirit of something like 'Pop Goes the Easel' or 'Three Little Pigskins.'  The only short on here I dislike is 'Restless Knights,' which I'd consider one of the worst shorts of the Curly era.  They only got better and better as they went along.  Hopefully future sets won't be long in coming and we won't have to wait another five-plus years for the second volume.",1197676800,19,2702,4.506147540983607

2890481,5,B000SSQ7JW,"First let me say that the Three Stooges HAVE NEVER LOOKED BETTER.  Some shorts like MOVIE MANIACS and A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN have looked horrible on television.  Negative shrinkage caused these two shorts the bounce up & down on all previous prints, almost unwatchable.  HERE THEY LOOK ROCK STEADY.

WOMAN HATERS looks like it was shot yesterday, I found no blemishes and was excited to see the rest of the disc.

PUNCH DRUNKS came on and immediately disappointed me.  Upon the first fade up there were nitrate streaks in the background.  Over all not bad, but this short did have some negative blemishes that could have been smoothed out with today's restoration technology.

MEN IN BLACK suffers from the same occasional blemishes, especially in a scene where the stooges ride out into the hallway in mini cars.

THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS looks a little grainier that the others, but not too noticable until the last minute.  For some reason the last minute of the short looks very grainy as if the master material was badly damaged and a second generation release print was used.

It does get much better from this point on, by 1936 the shorts look flawless.  After all of the horrendous public domain copies of DISORDER IN THE COURT, you will be surprised at how crisp & clear this comedy can look.

If you want extras, then you should get this excellent DVD full of bonus type material:

After having their work packaged & re-packaged to infinity---in varied quality, no doubt---the classic trio of slapstick finally get a worthy showcase. I was hoping that Volume One would have a larger index of shorts (since they made tons of them between 1934-58), but I'm certainly not complaining about the quality. Here are the original Stooges in their prime, with ""super-stooge"" Curly in the middle of it all.
Their debut short ""Woman Haters"" is a curious entry---a musical comedy done completely in rhyme---but the boys had to start somewhere, I suppose. From ""Punch Drunks"" on, the familiar formula comes into sharper focus, as well as their zany characterizations.

I also appreciate the ""Play All"" fature, sonething that was annoyingly missing on earlier DVD releases of the Stooges.  It's a real treat to be able to pop in the DVD and watch an entire year's worth of Stooges shorts!

The one thing that would makes these volumes even better is adding some bonus features, such as clips from news reels feturing the Stooges, and interviews with surviving cast members and Three Stooges film experts like Leonard Maltin.  Even without the bonus material, though, this volume is well worth the money.  Keep up the great work, Sony!",1194739200,3,986,4.551136363636363
2890490,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Wow. It took a long time to get the Three Stooges the proper presentation of their short films. But now here it is. The Three Stooges Collection presents the first 19 Stooges shorts made by the team from 1934-1936. All of the shorts are in chronological order and have been ""BEAUTIFULLY"" restored. Sony finally has done it. A collection for any Stooge fan to be proud to own in their collection. All shorts are presented complete and unedited. They look so good that its hard to believe that these short films were made over 70 years ago. For many years the Stooges dvds that were available were at best slipshod affairs. Fair to bad prints were used. All shorts were organized together by different themes. But now it looks like finally the Stooges will get the proper respect they deserve. All prints look pristine. Not a scratch, speck, or trace of dirt remain. As a matter of fact they look so good on todays widescreen tvs, that you could swear that they look similar to high definition quality (if they hadn't been filmed in b+w). It's almost as if the trio filmed all these shorts yesterday with hd quality cameras. The shorts look THAT good. The audio also has been cleaned up. No more hiss, crackles, or sound distortions. This dvd collection contains no bonus features, but for a super quality collection like this, it's not really an issue. Bravo to Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for finally getting it right. A absolute must for any stooge or slapstick dvd collector. I can't wait for the next editon to be released. Highly Highly recommended.",1194652800,5,1558,4.710622710622711

After many years of those dreadful ""themed"" DVD selections, featuring shorts that were out of sequence, or worse, containing edits (THREE LITTLE BEERS) or lackluster restorations (ALL THE WORLD'S A STOOGE), Columbia and Sony got their act together. Seeing how releasing television shows by complete seasons, in chronological order, became wildly popular, the Stooges were in need of the same treatment. The poor sales of the themed DVDs proved it, and the diehard fans demanded it.

Presented here are the first 19 shorts released by the team. These were the trio's early days after departing the domineering Ted Healy, and they were trying to prove themselves. The good news is that it did not take long for the Stooges to hit their stride. By the time of HOI POLLOI (#10), the trio had their formula downpat.

Every short in this set has been fully restorated to their stellar black and white perfection. The resolution is stunning, and the films will easily adhere to widescreen HD TV. I must admit I was partial to the 16 colourized shorts Sony released, as these added a new element to the Stooge legend. Let's face it: the trio rarely appeared in colour, even in the 1960s. As Sony has eagerly colourized the B/W seasons of ""Bewitched"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" it would have been nice to see Sony offer this Stooge collection in both colour and B/W incarnations. But why carp? We should be happy we even have this set!

For the casual fan, this set is a great way to start. For the diehard collector, this set is the start of a dream come true.",1194480000,5,1769,5.240282685512367

Sony has outdone themselves with the digital remastering of the shorts. The print quality on all of them is as pristine and crystal clear as they can possibly be given the fact that the films are over 70 years old.

I just have one big question that I can't find an answer for -- WHEN ARE THE NEXT VOLUMES COMING OUT?!?!?!?!?!

If someone tells me once a year, I'm going to cry.  Hopefully it'll be a few months at a time.

This new release has an outstanding picture and sound quality,from begining to end on each and every short. What makes this collection superb is that all 19 shorts are complete and nothing is missing from them. AND HERE IS A GRAND SUPRISE I WONT SAY WHICH SHORT IT IS BUT YOU WILL SEE A YOUNG LUCILLE BALL in one of the shorts .Since i have played my dvds of this collection i have not stopped laughing  from the first short to the last. This set covers the years of 1934 thru 1936 covering two years and in chronological order. The 1934 shorts has the ordinary intro of music to the stooges but by the ninth short called pardon my scotch we hear the famous the three stooges theme begin and from then on its stays. Outstanding shorts punch drunks,men in black,three little beers just to name a few is just totaly hilarious. This is a must for all stooge fans and lets all hope sony and columbia keep up all the way to shemp and joe besser shorts.

2890501,5,B000SSQ7JW,"I own old Stooge movies on the old VHS format of three movies per box for about 15 years now and I was reluctant to purchase this box set since I had about five of the nineteen on this newer release. However, the fact that you have the first two years of their movies in their entirety plus the quality looks as if they were shot last week, make this a must buy for any serious Stooge fan. I hope they'll realease all of them at least through the 30's. I always thought their 30's shorts were funnier without resorting to themes about war or jitterbuggin etc. Anyway, if you can't laugh during ""Three Little Beers"", ""Pop Goes The Easel"", ""Ants In The Pantry"", ""Pardon My Scotch"" or ""Disorder In The Court"" check your pulse to see if you're still alive. 19 of the funniest comedy shorts ever made for only $20. That's $1.05 per movie. Reminds me of the Old Dixie Theatre in my hometown. A must for the Stooge fans worldwide. ""You vill show me these stooges..no?",1193961600,10,960,4.368715083798882

I knew that most of the titles contained had already been released on previous discs, but I was still eager to buy this thinking there would be bonus features to make it worthwhile. Well, there aren't and so (besides a handful of shorts that haven't been released) this collection offers little more than what has already been released. If you haven't bought any Three Stooges discs yet, then buy this one because the transfer of picture is better and the years from 1934-36 are complete. However, if you already have the previous Columbia releases, this really isn't worth buying.",1193788800,18,641,4.836363636363636

My only beef with the set is the lack of special features.  If they can release every single Buster Keaton Columbia short with commentaries and featurettes and everything, why can't Sony pony up the money to have some expert commentaries for the Stooges?  I mean Buster was a master, but if his shorts, which aren't his best work, merit that much attention, why can't our favorite Stooges get some good commentary or documentary action?  Just a thought.",1193702400,7,675,4.743589743589744
2890505,5,B000SSQ7JW,"Finally after years of poor bootleg VHS tapes and inferior ""Three Stooges"" DVD's from low budget video companies trying to make a quick buck, Three Stooges fans have something to get excited about. After everything I've seen and heard in the 19 Stooge shorts presented in (The Three Stooges Collection, Volume One: 1934-1936) all I can say is HURRAY!

This incredible set contains the first 19 shorts in chronological order on two single sided discs complete with slim cases and great disc artwork and packaging. The picture and sound quality is like nothing I've ever seen and heard before. It seems that Sony / Columbia Pictures have heard the cries of Stooge fans and finally done something to make us happy.

The video transfer is just about perfect, so there really isn't anything to complain about. The sound has been dramatically improved over any previous ""Three Stooges"" release that I currently own and it sounds great on my home theatre system. Sure there are still some blemishes in the various shorts here and there, but nothing to stop you from enjoying this wonderful set. The opening segments as well as the shorts themselves are finally free from the age related issue's such as dirt, debris, scratches and sound hissing that used to plague these incredible shorts.

This is hopefully the start of something great for ""Three Stooges"" fans and I can't wait for the second volume to be released. There isn't any bonus material included in this set, but the overall quality of the shorts is what really matters. The 19 Shorts in Chronological Order are listed below.

The majority of the Colombia releases have been 192kb DD 2.0 for sound and and average of 6 mbps for picture quality . The more the shorts it seems the lower the mbps . But i guess it's all in the recording remastering process cause "" Curly Classics"" looked awful and had a better compression then the latest releases which have been looking very good . It looks as if this will take about 10 box sets if there doing 2 dvd's per set . I don't care if it took 20 as long as they use the best technology possible . The boys deserve it !  I hope they have the full ""Punch Drunks"" episode with the full ending . They should start shipping any day now so .. I can't wait !!!!  :)

well just got it .... I just got the set and well the sound is amazing but 3 discs were needed to do this right .The picture quality could have been better. Still it's a must have collection and hope the rest come out over the next 5 years.

Moe Howard,Larry Fine and Moe's brother Curly are first seen joining the Woman Haters' Club in WOMAN HATERS,but Larry quits after finding a young woman so irresistible and marrying her. PUNCH DRUNKS,written by the Stooges,features Curly as a boxer and defeats his opponent thanks to Larry playing POP GOES THE WEASEL on his violin.

In HORSES COLLARS,the boys reclaim a deed for a young woman's property of a tough,crooked thug. RESTLESS KNIGHTS features the boys in days of old,impressing the hell out of the queen. Art class is at its funniest in POP GOES THE EASEL(watch for cameos by Moe's and Larry's daughters when they were little girls,playing hopscotch). UNCIVIL WARRIORS is set in the Civil War era. PARDON MY SCOTCH features the boys posing as Scotchmen at a dinner party with Brether Heather,a concoction formulated at a drug store they work at. HOI POLLOI features the boys transformed from classless slobs to distinguished gentlemen. In THREE LITTLE BEERS,the boys are deliverymen shipping a large order of beer to a golf course and they wreck havoc there,of course. In ANTS IN THE PANTRY,the boys as exterminators,kill the little pests infesting a woman's house while she hosts a dinner party. In MOVIE MANIACS,the boys break into filmdom,sneaking into a tightly guarded studio with Moe posing as a director and Larry and Curly posing as an acting couple(Curly plays the female half). In HALF-SHOT SHOOTERS,the boys commit more mayhem during WOrld War I. In DISORDER IN THE COURT,the boys testify at a murder trial. In A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN,the boys are vaudeville actors on a train,distracting the other passengers,even the conductor. The boys are firemen in FALSE ALARMS. They're fired,re-instated and steal the captain's new car. In WHOOPS I'M AN INDIAN,the boys are indians who are wanted for violation of casino game rules. In SLIPPERY SILKS,the boys take their furniture-building skills to dressmaking. At a fashion show,one model wears a dress with drawers! Aside from Ball,great support from Vernon Dent,Symona Boniface,Bud Jamison,Stanley Blystone and others. HP was later remade twice,respectively as HALF-WITS HOLIDAY in 1946,which would be sadly,Curly's last short as a Stooge and PIES AND GUYS in 1957,with Joe Besser who was then the ""third Stooge"". AITP was remade as THE PEST MAN WINS with Shemp Howard,Moe's and Curly's brother. Much of the drugstore footage from PMS was recycled for 1943's DIZZY DETECTIVES. 19 down,171 to go.

I guess Sony finally realized that if Warner can remaster, restore, and rerelease the bulk of the Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry theatrical shorts on reasonably-priced DVD sets, then Sony had better wise up and do likewise for these non-animated theatrical shorts from a certain group of comedians who have had more influence, and more fans than the MGM or Warner cartoons!!!!

2890513,5,B000SSQ7JW,"THIS IS AN ACTUAL VIEWED, IN FULL, REVIEW FROM AN ADVANCED COPY OF THE NEW DVD SET I RECEIVED FROM SONY PICTURES ON 10/18/07:

To Stooge or not to Stooge, that is the question. For almost a decade since Sony began issuing The Three Stooges shorts on DVD, fans have been asking when chronological ordered sets would be released. During the last nine years, previous compilations have been a mixed bag of quality prints; odd pairings of titles; ill fated ""themed"" discs, and a color/B&W series. Some shorts were duplicated several times, while other films never saw the light of day. The number of shorts appearing on each disc steadily decreased. If you've felt burned by previous DVD releases that had splices, missing dialogue or deleted scenes, worry not.

Sony got the message. The Three Stooges Collection 1934-1936 is the first in a series of DVD's that presents the shorts in their original release order. For ardent fans, it's a knucklehead's dream. For the beginner, it is the proper way to be introduced to the legendary trio. Each short has been restored to its original running time.

For those of you not familiar with the history of the Three Stooges, they made more films than any comedy team. A total of 190 shorts (or two reelers) and five starring feature films were produced from 1934 through 1965 at Columbia Pictures. They hold the record for the longest running studio association in Hollywood history. This was no accident. Simply put, The Three Stooges are funny. They produced a bunch of classic episodes. Of course, with 190 titles, there are some lemons in the barrel. However, with the first set of chronological shorts, each one has plenty of Stooge brilliance. Even their first short, ""Woman Haters"", an oddity done in rhythm, has enough mayhem to rise it above the ""musical novelty"" that it was originally billed.

The Stooges' career was drenched in irony. During their heyday of appearing in the classic short films, the Stooges longed to make feature length movies, fearing that the shorts were holding them back. But it was the Columbia shorts that kept them alive. Because of their running time (between 16-18 minutes), The Three Stooges shorts were like mini sitcoms. They weren't bogged down with dated musical numbers and gooey romantic sub plots like features starring Abbott and Costello and The Marx Brothers, for example. The pacing was that of animated cartoons and the Stooges were human cartoon characters. The short films they made 70+ years ago fit surprisingly well in today's video game generation of quick paced action, fast edits and short attention spans.

The other alleged nail in their career coffin was television. When the shorts market dried up in theatres due to the popularity of TV, the Stooges thought they were finished. Their backlog of films were sold in syndication and millions of people have been exposed to them ever since, therefore rescuing them from obscurity and cementing them as pop culture icons.

The first 19 of these episodes are featured in this collection. But they don't look like they did on TV. Sony has lovingly restored each short to its original brilliance and the results are nothing short of spectacular. The quality of the restoration is on par with that of Disney, the Looney Tunes series and classic films like ""Wizard Of Oz"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Singin' In The Rain.""

I've seen each of these Curly shorts more times than I should admit to, and watching these newly mastered films is like seeing them for the first time. Gone are the hairline scratches, dust, pops and other debris commonly found on TV and previous VHS and DVD prints. The black and white resolution is rich and some of the shorts look like they have a glossy finish to them. On ""Three Little Pigskins"", the picture is so clear at times, I can see the beauty parlor sign behind the boys and read that a polish and fingerwave cost 79 cents. The picture quality is that pristine! Those glorious sound effects jump from my speakers. The oldest film on the set is 73 years, and it looks beautiful on a widescreen HD TV.

So, if you're still asking yourself the question: to Stooge or not to Stooge, the answer should be as predictable as a slap from Moe. Why, Soitinly!",1184198400,464,4224,4.816551724137931
