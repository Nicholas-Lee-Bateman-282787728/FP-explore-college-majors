2673086,4,B000JJRY7O,"This DVD is 90 minutes and the seminar starts at 5 minutes after commercials.  There are required supplemental materials at Traderslibrary.  To get the full benefits of the seminar, you must simultaneously view the PDF which has 36 slides.  This Marketplace Books ""Trade Secrets"" DVD is clear for both audio and video.  It is a standard aspect ratio video.  It is best viewed on a 19"" standard aspect ratio computer screen but is viewable on larger screens.

This is one of the FEW videos about daytrading which actually shows a NASDAQ Level II screen at 15:38.  Although there are only 2 in the PDF, they are there.  MOST other videos and even books about ""daytrading"" do NOT have even ONE Level II screen.  This is incredible since L2 screens are used by daytraders.  I also purchased this presenter's, Jea Yu, book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trading-Full-Circle-The-Complete-Underground-Trader-System-For-Timing-and-Profiting-in-All-Financial-Markets/dp/1592803903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trading Full Circle: The Complete Underground Trader System For Timing and Profiting in All Financial Markets</a>.  After looking through every single page in the book and the supplemental material at Traderslibrary, I cannot find ANY L2 screens.  This is amazing since Jea Yu mentions in his book ""Level II will be the primary execution tool"" on page 83.

The presenter covers daytrading tactics, psychology, and how beginners should start.  There is a lot of material in this 90 minute seminar.  The age of the material, as with many other available videos, might be a problem.  This seminar was recorded in 2001, as stated at the end of the video.  Although the DVD was published in 2005, the seminar was actually recorded in 2001.  The Level II screens show as fractions, not decimals.  Some of the market makers probably went out of business.  However, most of the material is still useful.  One feature about this DVD and the supplemental material I like is there is no hard sell.  The only commercials are at the beginning which you can skip.

Before buying any trading video seminar, I highly recommend you find the actual recording date.  Because Level II Trading Warfare covers a specific subject, it is still relevant.  I am taking 1 star away because of its production date.  However, I will definitely see this video and study the supplementary materials again.",1355443200,2,2417,5.412868632707775

2673088,5,B000JJRY7O,Great information - a must for any dancer regardless of the level you're at - will take your dancing to the next level,1345161600,,118,4.173913043478261
2673089,4,B000JJRY7O,"I have studied ballet as an adult for about a year and a half and find this DVD and the one on center work of the same level to be just right for me. Because I am not familiar with the Finis Jhung method, I'm going to buy the Level 1 DVD as well to familiarize myself with his principles.

Finis Jhung's method is unique. I like how he makes you think about weight transfer and placement before executing each movement. The way he asks the demonstrating dancer to hold the barre is also very interesting - I have never been taught this way by any of the dozen teachers I have had. The DVD on center work not only provides a step-by-step breakdown of each variation, but also corrections and tips on how to improve the quality of the movement, which I find to be extremely useful.

It is a pity though, that the music composed for the exercises is so terrible. My husband, who is a music composer, balks at the awkward rhythms and the jarring melodies when he heard the music. In fact, he said, there is no melody to speak of! As for me, I find the music an obstacle to practicing along with the DVD. In fact, it is so bad that it doesn't inspire me to dance at all. I'm going to try to play another CD with classical music for ballet class while I play the DVD - muted during demonstration. I believe that a great teacher like Finis Jhung deserves much better music for his lessons.",1221955200,11,1382,4.231060606060606

I never studied ballet before and started less than a year ago but I'm lucky to go to Finis Jhung's class. His teaching method is unique and highly effective if you follow his instructions.  This video is a step forward form barrework Level 1 but still very enjoyable, doable and rewarding for beginners. All Finis' exercises are to teach you that ballet is not positions but movement, show why and how you move and how to find your balance. You gradually build your strength and improve your balance. Barre work is great as a preparation for the center work.  Owning this DVD (as well as other Finis' videos) is almost like having private lessons with him!  All this instructions and remarks to Kelly Waddell are very precise and easy to follow but the exercises if performed correctly are quite challenging.  After a short while you will be amazed with your progress. I highly recommend this DVD not only to absolute and more advanced beginners with some ballet experience.  I think that to get the real ballet class experience it is worth while to use both the Barrework and Centerwork DVDs of the same level. You will also enjoy the beautiful music of Scott Killian composed especially for Finis Jhung.",1220313600,6,1470,5.573991031390134
2673091,5,B000JJRY7O,"I learned ballet as an adult and have had beginning classes in jr. college as well as a year or two with a dance company ""Ballet Arts"" in Minneapolis.  I stopped just before the intermediate level I think.  I have been away from dance for a number of years and bought this DVD hoping for a good class to review what I had previously learned.  Finis is a wonderful instructor (he's with the American Ballet Theater in NY City!) and talks you through each exercise in detail.  I don't like the fact that you have to buy the centerwork seperately, however.  I would say stretching and abdominal work would add to the DVD as well.  I also have The NY City Ballet Workouts 1 and 2 which I think are fantastic, but this is even more like a real class (NY City Ballet does floor barr work so there is no chance to practice balancing with the barr work). I have ordered centerwork level 2 and can't wait to be ready for level 3!  I highly recommend this DVD for teachers as well as students!",1216252800,9,983,4.281081081081081
2673092,4,B000JJRY7O,"This video is a static camera recording of a conference session. As such, it's without context and difficult to follow.  In conjunction with Jae's book ""Secrets of the Underground Trader"", however, this clarifies many of Jae's concepts and illustrates how to implement many of the strategies in Jae's book.  The book is great, with very specific scalping and swing strategies, but Jae's style is extremely dense and assumes an understanding of many chart-watching concepts. The book alone requires numerous readings to grasp - the video alone lacks context and is weakly produced.  The combination, however, will add a very powerful set of strategies to any trader, especially traders specializing in NASDAQ 100 stocks.",1203984000,10,719,5.345132743362832
2673093,2,B000JJRY7O,A relatively weak presentation and not very structural...slides are very not professional... and maybe not very updated to today's market... I guess he spent time on level II but not a lot... So far.. I do not like it.,1186099200,8,218,4.615384615384615
2673094,5,B000JJRY7O,"I bought this video as part of a set.

What I loved in especially about this particular video is it takes off right where I left off with the first one. Easy to learn from, because each step is filmed from behind and I don't have to transform the steps in my head.",1135728000,,264,3.981132075471698
8151192,5,B000JJRY7O,I attend ballet classes three times a week. I am an advanced beginner and still struggle in class to keep track of the combinations without losing my form/technique. Many of the combinations in the video are similar to those in my classes. This video has allowed me to focus on my technique while developing a fluency in the combinations at my own pace. My ballet instructors have noticed that my progress in class outpaces many of the others. I have Finis Jhung's videos to thank for this.,1519084800,,490,4.64367816091954
8151193,1,B000JJRY7O,"Not a good starting place for the beginner, presentation was choppy and very difficult to understand. ""Jea Yu"" spoke WAY too fast, I had to stop the DVD to try to process what the hell he was talking about, even his audience looked confused. He also said very little about level 2 strategy. This guy is way too impressed with himself to provide any benefit to anyone trying to understand level 2.",1510358400,,396,4.513888888888889
8151194,5,B000JJRY7O,"I started out with barre level 2 and became an instant fan. Finis Jhung delivers when it comes to direct, easy to understand, clear and thorough instruction!  I took ballet years ago and the instruction doesn't touch his technique. He makes you aware of head and arm placement, posture, and even finger placement.  I'm  doing his tapes twice to three times a week and already am seeing great results in my technique and placement. I feel stronger, confident, and excited every time I press start. I don't feel like I'm slogging through boring repetitions. he explains, he encourages. I'll be sure to buy more of these excellent tutorials. I can't wait to gain enough strength to get on pointe!",1492732800,,693,4.80672268907563
