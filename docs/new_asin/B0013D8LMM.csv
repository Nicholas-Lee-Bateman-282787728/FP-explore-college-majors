3104131,5,B0013D8LMM,I wanted this movie cause I love Angus Macfadyen. I was in perfect shape and played perfectly. Not a scratch on it!,1364256000,,115,4.2727272727272725
3104132,3,B0013D8LMM,Arrived in great condition. I hoped this was a different movie. It is ok suspense wise. Lotta graphic sex. Not good for the kids.,1329523200,,129,4.416666666666667
3104133,1,B0013D8LMM,"I thought I was going to settle down on the couch and watch a somewhat decent psycho / mystery...but instead I got this piece of crap.  This little pile of puke contains some of the worst acting this side of a Troma production.  Angus MacFadyen was absolutely horrible in his ""duel"" roles.  Willa Ford should just stick to taking off her clothes.  A cardboard cutout could act rings around her.  This movie is so stupid that I think I lost some brain cells just by watching it.  The whole premise is beyond ridiculous and even a feeble mind like mine couldn't take that leap of faith.  Do they really think anyone would believe a doppleganger could just appear in someone's life like this?  Oh yeah....just a coincidence!  We all know that all of us have a evil stalker duplicate who happens to live in the same city that we do.  And of course, he just happens to bump into our wife at a bar.  And everyone knows that she will think it is her husband and take him to her hotel room to have mad passionate sex.  Yeah, it happens everyday.  It happended to me last night.  What?  You don't believe me?  Well, that's the feeling you will get while watching this turkey.  When you base your plot on something the audience can't possibly believe in...it becomes a laughable endeavor.  Throw in the demented acting of chubby Angus, and everything unravels very quickly.  I had a hard time sitting through this mess.  I only woke from my stupor when the cardboard Willa discarded her clothes.  By the way, who cast this slop?  These two ""actors"" make for the most unlikely couple ever.  They would never connect in real life.  It's another negative mark for this flick.  Almost any other psycho/slasher movie would be more plausable than this.  After watching this, my IMPULSE is to flush it down the toilet where it belongs.",1292544000,4,1818,4.568322981366459

3104135,1,B0013D8LMM,"I watched this movie because of all of the hype in the local Dallas, TX area over this film, and another she had coming out.  I was extremely disappointed because this film was nothing more than a porn gone bad.  Willa Ford cannot act to save her life.  I've seen better cinematography from a 1st year film student.  Don't waste your time or money on this flop.  You will thank me.  I'll think twice before I ever watch another movie that this ""actress"" is in.  Mo you could have done way better than her.  I hope you were smart enough to get a prenup!",1212537600,6,552,4.240384615384615
3104136,5,B0013D8LMM,"Impulse is worth the price, and is a movie that will be watched over again.  I give it at least an A for a variety of things.  It also should be noted that this is an indie flick, and an indie flick done really well.

Impulse has the ability to be nominated for an award; Willa and Angus both have an amazing acting ability and really do shine in this film.  Overall, the plot is crafted well.  The script is great and the movie really brings out suspense and emotion.

Overall, a great film.  However, the ending could have been longer and more specific.  With that said, Impulse is one of the best thriller/suspense films to come along...in a long time!

A film for everyone, but beware there is nudity, but don't buy it for that as the film all together is amazing.

Two thumbs up!",1208995200,11,784,4.308219178082192
3104137,5,B0013D8LMM,"This flick is a must watch for thriller fans craving a little steam with the creep of a stalker. Claire Dennison decides to spice up her marriage to an introverted psychologist. But things go wrong when she finds herself in a hot affair with her husband's doppelganger. Her life turns upside down as the man stalks her.

Suspense continues to build throughout, and you will not regret spending 101 minutes watching it. Angus MacFadyen ROCKS in this film!

There is a lot of sex in the beginning, but believe it or not, it fits with the plot. I get tired of the obligatory T&A, but this was entirely different and actually worked without feeling forced.",1208563200,18,652,4.660869565217391

8250248,4,B0013D8LMM,We enjoyed the movie. The idea behind the plot was a little hard to believe but the movie pulls it off well enough that you buy into it and go along for the ride. The suspense was well played out leaving you interested until the end. The sex scenes were plenty hot enough for date night at home on the sofa with a big bowl of popcorn. The boredom and problems within the marriage that brought about the premise of the movie will inspire conversation with your spouse; good conversations!,1473206400,2,487,4.4222222222222225
