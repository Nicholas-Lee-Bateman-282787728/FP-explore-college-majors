8178314,1,B000NJL4QW,"I would not give this film a zero for 3 reasons.
A: I thought some of the camera work; that is some of the visuals worked quite well in evoking some response. and
B: I happen to know that this movie was actally filmed over 10 years ago in NYC despite the 2007 DVD release date.
C: The Star, Director, Producer and some of the crew were all from Korea.
Not that that makes up for the poor quality but it may help to explain why they possibly had a hard time in transitioning the film into an American vision.",1205107200,,507,4.08
