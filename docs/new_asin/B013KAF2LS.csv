7368263,5,B013KAF2LS,"This is a wonderful telling of Giambattista Basile fairy tales. I remember seeing ""The Flea"" story done once before, but not nearly as cinematic and well crafted. It's a wonderful movie and should be watched by anyone with a love for fantasy. It's a near perfect film!!!",1477353600,3,270,4.76595744680851
7368264,2,B013KAF2LS,"This movie was a huge disappointment. While it had fantastic costuming and great acting, the plot was sorely lacking. The three mini stories it alternated between had nothing to do with each other, though they tried to tie them together by having surviving characters in the same room together in the very end. Fail! The ending was nonsensical, feeling like it wasn't finished. All in all, the three stories and the movie overall seemed to literally have no point or resolution. This is the only movie besides ""The Ninth Gate"" that I've watched and felt it was an utter waste of time and money. I definitely do NOT recommend watching, let alone buying!",1475625600,,652,4.778761061946903

7368266,5,B013KAF2LS,"Matteo Gerone's adaptation of three of noted folklorist Giambattista Basile's macabre and dark tales is certainly not what you expect. From a crazed queen doing anything to have a child (and believe me when I say ""anything""), a lustful king who becomes addled with the beautiful voice of an old woman (with far-reaching consequences for her and her sister), and a foolish king so consumed with raising a giant flea that he pays no attention to his daughter until something happens that you don't expect to change them both. All three stories intertwine with each other in certain ways, but could stand on their own as separate films. As I said in my title, this is definitely *not* Disney  folks. These are how fairy tales were originally presented. But if you want something different, then watch it. Beautiful cinematography, lovely performances, and stories that stay with you long after you put the disc away.",1475280000,,913,4.928571428571429
7368267,5,B013KAF2LS,"Oh my god, this movie was way better than I expected!!!! Lots of twist and turns a nice new set of ""fairy tales"" with a dark twist and the the good 'ol hidden meaning, be careful what you wish for.",1474761600,3,197,3.95
7368268,4,B013KAF2LS,"This movie is a hodgepodge of fairy tales; strange and grotesque, but captivating and beautifully filmed. This movie is a visual feast. The acting and the international cast is superb. If you like Tim Burton's work and early Neil Jordan films, you'll like this. DO NOT MISS!",1474416000,,274,4.851063829787234
7368269,1,B013KAF2LS,"Was looking forward to a GOOD period movie.  Boy oh boy...WHAT A LET DOWN.... Don't waste your money on this one.  It's story is absolute ridiculous and base,",1473552000,,158,4.607142857142857
7368270,1,B013KAF2LS,"I really wanted to love this film. I appreciate artistic film and love fantasy and tales-but this movie was truly awful. I can only say one good thing about it-the costumes were lovely to look at. The ending kind of ties it all together-but as in any fairy tale you want to see the lesson--and there is none. Really no lesson or reason at all for this. I kept thinking-maybe if I knew the story already it would make sense to me. I don't know because I am not familiar with this story-but being of Italian heritage, I had hoped to learn something-but no-empty.",1467072000,6,560,4.394230769230769
7368271,5,B013KAF2LS,"This Italian wonder (filmed in English, no subtitles needed) directed by Matteo Garrone comes out of Giambattista Basile's 17th century fairy tales, the Pentamerone, which was later adapted by the Brothers Grimm. If you are afflicted with ADHD, dislike European cinema, or are expecting Game of Thrones or zombies, don't bother watching this flick.

PLOT
The story is alternating sequences following the remnants of three sets of royalty: mother and son, father and daughter, and a king without family who thrives on sexual conquest. At first glance, it appears set in the Medieval or Renaissance periods, but when the King of Longtrellis dons an armored diving suit to hunt a sea monster, we quickly come to realize ""Il racconto dei racconti"" is to be a fantastic tale.

ACTORS
Many great actors, here are a few:
 The formidable and wildly sexy Salma Hayek, both an actress (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frida/dp/B007HJ9LXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frida</a>) and producer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugly-Betty/dp/B003F3NDOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugly Betty</a>), is the unrelenting Queen of Longtrellis.
 Notable French actor Vincent Cassel is the King of Strongcliff, the licentious scoundrel archetype.
 The unforgettable Toby Jones (you've seen him in something) is the King of Highhills (a wise choice for the role), and Bebe Cave is absolutely perfect as Violet, his attention-starved princess daughter who gets more than she bargained for.
 The twins in Tale of Tales are not a product of special effects but are indeed two identical twins.

CINEMATOGRAPHY
Stunning. The early scene of Salma Hayek dressed in black sitting in a utterly white room eating a sea monster's bloody red heart is striking and sets expectations high. Locations are very well chosen, and it's often difficult to tell where our world ends and this fantasy world begins. The style so heavily used in Tale of Tales (not found enough in American cinema of this genre) provides an air where anything is possible.

 Final thoughts  This is not a family movie, mostly due to the lecherous King of Strongcliff, but then we already know from the Brothers Grimm that fairy tales can be pretty intense. Connecting all three crowns, the ending of Il racconto dei racconti is at once grand and understated, and is befitting of what we expect from a fairy tale ending. I hope this one gets its due in the States, but it may be destined to remain obscure here.",1450483200,20,2520,5.455012853470437
8728086,5,B013KAF2LS,"Tale Of Tales is quite a tale. Id say this is one of the best fairy tale movies Ive seen in a long time. The stories are interesting, great characters, and very nice scenery too! I thought the makeup effects were very good. Its a very well done flick overall. I would definitely recommend this unique fantasy/horror fairy tale. Id say this is the best of its kind. The animated credits are a nice touch as well. 5/5",1500595200,,415,4.333333333333333

8728088,1,B013KAF2LS,"I just finished watching this piece of garbage.  I feel obligated to warn people NOT to watch it.  It has no value or merit.  Yes, it has some famous actors in it, but they are not enough to save it.  The movie is based on faerie tales written by Giambattista Basile (15661632).  That writer makes Timothy Leary, Frank Zappa and S. Hunter Thompson all look clear-headed and sane.  There is disturbing content in this movie that cannot be unseen.  You can disregard my opinion and watch it at your own risk, but remember, I warned you.",1489017600,,534,4.5

8728091,4,B013KAF2LS,"""Tale of Tales""(2015) weaves three stories that remain largely separate, though inhabiting adjacent kingdoms that meet at the film's end. The three stories are rather dark or grim tales, and more for adult consumption than for children. These stories are built up gradually and beautifully as they slowly divulge their secret little worlds. The stories can be strange, disturbing and magical at the same time, and eventually simply resolve themselves like a music box that comes to an end until at some point it's wound up again.",1487980800,,529,5.091954022988506
