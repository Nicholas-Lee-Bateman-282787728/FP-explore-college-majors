8152668,5,B000JQVALS,"Excellent dvd, I bought it along with the book and a sample pack at a sewing expo. Expensive but worth it if you really want to learn how to do Ribbonwork.  I think it's really worth having the DVD along with the book. I don't agree with the reviewer who gave it 1 star because it has excellent close-ups with an incredible amount of detail on many different types of flowers.",1410134400,,376,4.295774647887324
8152669,5,B000JQVALS,"I love her book and dvd, it's very descriptive, her work and demos are amazing!!  I am very happy with my purchase!  Well worth the money!",1361836800,,138,4.269230769230769
8152670,5,B000JQVALS,"I have bought several books on this subject and still couldn't make a perfect flower from ribbon. After watching this DVD from Helen Gibbs, my flowers look professional. It is so nice to be able to replay the DVD several times if you are a slow learner. And it was alot cheaper than taking one of her classes in Denver. Excellent DVD",1345680000,3,333,4.387096774193548
8152671,1,B000JQVALS,"Terrible DVD. Camera man took long shots of the Teacher talking half the time instead of focusing on her hands so we could't see what she was doing, and the teacher never finished ONE ribbon.  The DVD cost TWICE as much as most craft DVD's and it is horrible.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1330128000,10,297,4.584905660377358
8152672,5,B000JQVALS,The beginners guide to Ribbon making is very good.  I would have liked to have a book as well to go to quicker when I need fast help rather than set up the computer and dvd and wait to get to the point.  I though it came with book when I bought it.,1242864000,15,248,3.660377358490566
8152673,5,B000JQVALS,"For anyone who loves ribbonwork and is a visual learner, this DVD is a God send!  There are lessons with Helen showing you how to make her beautiful ribbon flowers and leaves.  She includes a section on necessary supplies and even some projects!  The best part is that the techniques are shot over her shoulder so you see the crafting of the flowers from your perspective, making the techniques so much easier to understand.  This is an invaluable ribbonwork tool, and what could be better than 2 hours of private lessons with the wonderful Helen Gibb?",1187222400,24,552,4.71875
