8756463,5,B01DNA681S,Stephen Jones is a teacher of scripture and the laws of God like no other!!!  His God-given wisdom and knowledge on these matters are above reproach.  I fully endorse his teachings and the awareness of his strong position in Christ.,1461628800,2,232,4.775
8756464,5,B01DNA681S,"Another great revelation shared by Dr. Jones, as we let God renew our minds and lead us into agreement with Him. This biblical perspective on Intercession provides valuable insight into why so many prayers are not effective. It takes a whole new way to look at how God views and handles petitions and the role we play as followers in Christ. This is a fundamental teaching on God as the just and merciful Judge and how ought to approach Him.",1461024000,,441,4.525
