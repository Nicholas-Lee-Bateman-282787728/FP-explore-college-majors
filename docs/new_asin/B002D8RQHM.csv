The performances are outstanding, the cast gels so well, and the writing is phenomenal. This series is a highlight of American comedy and should not be overlooked. The cast of characters is varied and plot always humorous. It is a shame that the show was cancelled by Fox and thankfully it has been revived. Any and all should take a chance on it.",1352937600,,439,4.641025641025641
8364942,1,B002D8RQHM,"Right now (8/20/12) This is an awful deal - the two seasons cost much less if you simply buy them separately.

So while I think the show is brilliant (see review below) be careful when buying combined offers that you're not
paying more than you should.

Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the one
sane one trying to hold things together.  Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart
and Monty Python had teamed up to do a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom.  Even producer Ron Howard's narration is terrific.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did
they ever get this on network TV?  And thank god they did!""  On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant,
a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had to fill 30+ episodes.  The second season, with only 18
episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness.

And if you watch these two seasons, be sure to then see the third.  It is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top, but usually successfully),
with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character,  and self-referential episodes like `Save Our Bluths' dealing
slyly with the series tragic cancellation - one of the biggest mistakes in the history of television.",1304035200,,1532,4.805343511450381
8364943,5,B002D8RQHM,"It's really a shame that this show only lasted 3 years on TV.  It was one of the most original, innovative comedies to come out in a very long time!  I highly recommend the DVDs for any fans of the show, or any of the actors on the show.  Every time I watch an episode, it gets funnier, and I notice little things that I didn't the first time around.",1266624000,,350,3.9714285714285715
8364944,5,B002D8RQHM,"One of the few shows that I can watch repeatedly without getting bored. Lots going on, you'll be surprised what you missed the first time. A smart comedy.",1265760000,,154,4.535714285714286
8364945,5,B002D8RQHM,This show was an instant classic when it first arrived on Fox. There hasn't been a show like this on TV before and there will probably never be a show like this again. There's nothing else I can say.,1264118400,,199,4.128205128205129
8364946,5,B002D8RQHM,"This is Seasons One and Two bundled together, six discs in all.  This is a great set, but make sure you get it at Wal-Mart for $20, not here.  As for the series itself, it's one of the best television shows of all time, brilliantly written and acted.",1252972800,5,250,4.1875
