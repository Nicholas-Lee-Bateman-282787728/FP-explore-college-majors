This DVD, like all of his other programs should be as widely available as possible. They--that its, whoever has the rights, need to release this series mentioned here on DVD as well as 'Romer's Egypt' and 'Seven Wonders of the Ancient World'. Dr. Romer--are you there? Please help make it so! :)",1521849600,,471,4.552941176470588
8345412,5,B001V19TFE,"I have been into all of John Romer's series for quite a long time now. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon when I was merely typing his name in one day when I was bored. For some reason, they have changed the title of the series (don't know why) and also it is only available in Dutch, although obviously John Romer speaks English on the series so there is no problem there. This is an excellent series for anyone interested in ancient history, archaeology, ancient cultures, cultures long since past and also the Mediterranean too. Why they don't release it in an English format I just do not know. It had to be sent from Holland too, which is no bad thing but surely someone out there could sell it specifically for an English-speaking audience. One other thing I would like to say too: when is someone going to release ALL John Romer's brilliant, concise, insightful and very often witty series on all sorts of historical subjects? I have found that on the American Amazon, you can buy many more John Romer products than you can than Britain, and I am perplexed by this. There seems to be loads of British (and perhaps Aussies and other English speakers!) fans who would love to get their hands on these products. SO, anyone out there prepared to do this??!! I hope so.

Back to the series then. It is an enjoyable romp through all kinds of ancient cultures and also the history of recent archaeology and the study of ancient history too. It is also quite philosophical too, which is sort of very typical John Romer. I love the guy too, he doesn't take himself all that seriously at all even though he is a brilliant and accomplished academic, he likes to joke and crack funny asides, and speaks with a slight Cockney accent to boot. Not really your textbook academic at all really, but it doesn't detract from his gentle and thoughtful presentation style.

If you like ancient history, archaeology, studying ancient cultures, and other related topics, I think you should check out these dvds.",1372809600,4,2015,4.625698324022347
