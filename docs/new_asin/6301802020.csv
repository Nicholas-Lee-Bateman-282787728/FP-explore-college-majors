377986,3,6301802020,"""The 7 cities of gold"" is a 1955 Cinemascope historical adventure about the colonization of California by the Spanish in the 18th century. Michael Rennie stars as Father Junipero Serra in a film based on the 1951 novel ""The 9 Days of Father Serra"" by Isabelle Gibson Ziegler.

The 7 cities of gold (Cibola) is a 16th century Spanish myth that propelled many expeditions to the new world. It was based on the incredible 1542 journal of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca who journeyed on foot from Florida to Mexico in 1528.

Michael Rennie (1909-71) had an active film career in England and then because of his unique physical appearance and voice was tapped by Robert Wise to play Klaatu in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951). He went on make dozens of films and was active on TV as Harry Lime in ""The Third Man"" (1959-65). Rennie does his usual stoic job here.

Rugged Anthony Quinn (1915-2001) plays a Spanish captain looking for the 7 cities. In 1955 he was a major star having won the Oscar for ""Viva Zapata"" (1952). Quinn, of course, left us a great legacy of more than 100 roles, with films like ""Zorba the Greek"" (1961) and ""Lust for Life"" (1956). He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, winning twice for Best Supporting Actor. Quinn gives his usual performance.

Handsome Richard Egan (1921-87) won the Golden Globe in 1954 as Most Promising Newcomer, even though ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" was his 25th film since his debut in 1949. He's best remembered for his starring role in ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962). Egan plays a soldier who gets mixed up with the locals.

There is a strong supporting cast that includes Jeffrey Hunter (as an Indian!), Rita Moreno, and John Doucette.

Director Robert Webb (1903-90) won an Oscar for ""In Old Chicago"" (1937), which would surprise anyone who saw the film. He's best known for ""Beneath the 12 Mile Reef"" (1953) and ""Love me Tender"" (1956) of the 15 films he directed.

Lucien Ballard does the camera work. Ballard was one of the greatest cinematographers. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Caretakers"" (1963) and won a NSFC Award for ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He lensed more than 100 films, including such notables as ""The Desert Rats"" (1953) with Hathaway directing, and ""True Grit"" with Wayne and Hathaway, He was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah who used him in several of his films - ""Ride the High Country"" (1962), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), ""The Getaway"" (1972), ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue""(1970), and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).

In 1955  ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"". Westerns released that year included ""Chief Crazy Horse"", ""Davy Crockett"", ""The Treasure of Pancho Villa"" ""White Feather"" and ""Wichita"".

The NY Times called it ""a rapt and reverent tribute"" but also complained about ""theatrical heroics that takes this week's cornmeal cake"" and the ""slow moving"" pace. They said Quinn was ""reasonable"" but Hunter and Moreno ""are quite absurd,"" and  though the ""scenery is occasionally handsome...more often it is obviously fake.""

A film like this can be viewed quite differently depending on your politics. To some it will represent the subtle destruction of the indigenous culture, with priests as another weapon of the military, and Serra as a villain even if he himself didn't wield a rifle. To others it will represent the spread of Christianity to the heathens, and Serra will be a hero. People interested in this subject might want to read ""Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest"" (2004) by Matthew Restall.

There are few films about the colonization of California by the Spanish. ""Cabeza de Vaca"" (1991) deals with the first men exploring the southwest, but ends in the mid 16th century. The Zorro films (1920 and onwards) are set in the early 19th Century as is the Cornel Wilde film ""California Conquest"" (1952).

Apart from being a bit too long and highly predictable, this film has two problems. First, everyone speaks English, so that from the first meeting of the Indians and the Spanish everyone communicates. We know from films like ""Dances with Wolves"" that the language problem is a major one to overcome, so this glossing over is definitely a fault and a lost opportunity.

The second problem is the casting of non Indians in the two major Indian roles. Hunter and Moreno are good actors, and their acting, per se, is OK in this film, but their mere appearance is ridiculous when viewed in this day and age, but even in the mid 50s it seems silly.

Bottom line - one of the few films about the colonization of California by the Spanish, more particularly a biography of sorts about Father Serra, but not a very good film otherwise. Fans the principal actors will find better films for each of them elsewhere.",1316217600,7,5079,4.832949308755761
377987,4,6301802020,"This celebration of vile missionary politics is a glossy, Fox CinemaScope project soaping up the story of Junipero Sera and the founding of San Diego.  Michael Rennie cuts a classic figure as a pious pain-in-the-neck trying to convert everyone in sight with some terribly-distinguished, preachy phrasemaking.  A mirage bit with Mary and Joseph is as laughably middle-class as things get.  California camp.
The streaming version is presented in anamorphic CinemaScope and lush color by DeLuxe.  You get the original, 4-track stereo mix, which really enhances Hugo Friedhofer's superb music score - the best thing about the picture.",1293926400,4,630,5.463917525773196
377988,4,6301802020,"I bought this movie not for the subject matter but rather for the rare leading role Michael Rennie was given in it. I'm not a history buff so the inaccuracies in the film don't particularly bother me. I bought this to add to my collection of films in which Rennie, one of my favorite actors, had a meaty part. If you liked his gentle yet strong portrayal of Klaatu in his most famous film, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", you'll also love his gentle yet strong portrayal of Father Serra, the missionary who went along with the Spanish on their expedition into California in the late 1700's. The film centers on Rennie's portrayal of this legendary priest and his quiet bravery and determination in the face of many obsticles to bring Christianity to the Indian peoples of California. Rennie was excellent, and while this movie is a bit 'sappy' at times..typical for a 1955 movie with religious overtones.. as a Rennie fan I was still delighted with his performance, which is why I gave the film 4 stars. They are for Rennie, not for the content or historical accuracy of the movie. If you enjoy this wonderful English character actor, this film will not disappoint you!",1124150400,26,1170,4.657004830917875
377989,2,6301802020,"Excellent cast, however not enough dialogue nor adventure for the Seven Cities they were in search of.  Only 3 were slightly addressed in the movie. Granted, the priest was benevolent, but because he was given too much focus, the efforts of the Spanish conquest paled in significance. The Title ""The Mission Priest"" more accurately describes this movie, and it should be placed under a ""Religious"" rather than ""Historical"" category.",1116288000,6,432,5.260869565217392

7816719,2,6301802020,"Although the film holds interest, there is something a bit anemic about the script. The film was released in 1955, so it goes without saying that any matters of European colonization would be condensed and sanitized. The only real drama in the film comes towards the end, and it's more of a melodrama concerning a Spanish soldier's love interest with a native girl. On the plus side, the cinematography is at times quite lovely, and the actors (especially Michael Rennie and Anthony Quinn) turn in quite admirable performances. In the end, however, the film is ""neither fish nor fowl."" It lacks the integrity of a solid historical documentary and the drama of a free work of fiction. In light of the recent canonization of Serra, I'm wondering if it will get more views. I recommend the film as a starting point for any debates about his canonization. It's 60 years after the film was released and only a few days after his canonization. Let's see what modern filmmakers might do. Only two stars, but recommended.",1443398400,2,1013,4.7942857142857145
