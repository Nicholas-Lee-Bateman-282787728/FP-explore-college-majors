7829585,4,6302699231,"Technically this is episode 5 of season 1 of ""American Playhouse"" but since is being sold as a stand alone product I will refer to it as a movie in this review. It is seconds short of being 52 minutes which is a little short for a movie.
Fred Gwynne and Les Podewell were great. Their actions early in the movie when Les Podewell's character says ""Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby is a Friend of Mine"" said a great deal about both characters. However, some of  the other acting in the movie could have been better, at least early in the movie. As the movie progressed either they improved, or I was so interested in the plot I did not notice the problems. The sound could have been better in one scene early in the movie. Overall I enjoyed the movie and none of the problems diminished that.
The mood for the movie is foretold in the first scene with three words opening the movie: SENSE OF HUMOR.
The movie is not to be taken seriously, but neither is it to be taken as supernatural. Anyone with any working knowledge of Charles Dickens will know there is a problem with Fred Gwynne's character right off, but let me assure you, all is not as it seems, even after you first realize that all is not what it seems. That may sound like double talk, but it is the best way I can think of to explain it briefly.
The plot of the movie is coming to terms with who the character is (or isn't), and how much it really matters. The plot also comes up with a working solution for the character's problem at the end of the movie. It stays light and easy, a good family film with no violence, sex, profanity nor nudity. Nothing objectionable unless you have no sense of humor and find it objectionable for a person to live a life of fantasy. It is sort of a situation comedy leaning toward drama in a tongue-and-cheek sort of way.
As for the extras:
The ""Author's bio"", ""Neal Miller's bio"", and the  ""Actor's bio"" on this disc are short and to the point. They are informative without being so long you do not want to spend the time it would take to read them.",1395619200,4,2046,4.284237726098191

SYNOPSIS--
Set in the 1940s, it's the story of a failed writer (Gwynne) who decks himself out in 19th Century attire and visits small Green Town, IL.

Ralph Spaulding (Svrusis) works part-time at a barber shop until this mysterious stranger claiming to be Charles Dickens hires him to transcribe a book he's currently working on:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-TALE-OF-TWO-CITIES/dp/0743487605/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A TALE OF TWO CITIES</a>. Ralph's fascination with 'Dickens' drives a wedge between him and his more pragmatic barber friend, Mr. Wyneski (Womack).

Ralph is not alone in his admiration however, for a young lady who prefers to be called Emily Dickenson (Dunagan) also falls under the writer's spell. Friendship between these three brings positive and permanent changes in the lives of the believers even as it helps the stranger come to a more honest understanding of himself.

An unseen Ray Bradbury narrates as the adult Ralph.
