705385,5,6303682979,"That's what has-been vaudevillian Laurence Olivier says to daughter Joan Plowright when commenting on his frustrating, failed life in ""The Entertainer"", and when he says it and you look, by golly if he doesn't look dead indeed.
This movie makes me uncomfortable and I really don't like to watch it, but that cannot make me deny that it is one of Olivier's greatest jobs. I think part of the way he can convey this male menopause pathos derived from his own life at the time, the way Gable's own tragedies inform ""Homecoming"". At this point, yes, Olivier had won an Oscar and gained a knighthood, but his personal life was a shambles. He was married to Vivien Leigh who was sickly and suffering from mental illness. He once described it to Lauren Bacall in this fashion: The first ten years were heaven, the last hell.  The strain was beginning to show in Larry, and that's what is communicated in his depiction of Archie Rice, the entertainer who hasn't got any joy in his own life. Archie's made a mess of things: he's a bankrupt, he's got a wife who's stupid and tiresome, he's got to play in these tawdry seaside resorts. He manages to seduce a naive young girl, and is hoping perhaps to shake off both the wife and this bad luck that's been plaguing him, but everything always falls through. Life can't help being lousy, I guess is the message of ""The Entertainer"", and does one heck of a job showing us the seamy side of a two-bit talent's life.
Of course, the great irony is that in real life, Olivier began an affair with the actress playing his daughter, Joan Plowright. What might have been just another example of life imitating art--of Olivier playing out the seducer element of ""The Entertainer""--actually worked out to his benefit. The result was the end of his dismal marriage to Vivien Leigh and a new marriage, now to the years-younger Plowright, with whom he had two children (something that never happened with Leigh), and a breath of fresh air into his performing life as he staged more Shakepeare et al. with this new Lady Olivier. All of that is why I can stomach watching ""The Entertainer"", you know: Thank God Olivier had better things ahead of him after all than poor Archie Rice.
So, if you can appreciate verismo in film and would like to see the English-speaking world's greatest actor play against type, take a seat at ""The Entertainer"" and count your blessings that you can leave your woes AT the theatre when you leave.",1015718400,29,2449,4.629885057471264
705386,5,6303682979,"Laurence Olivier's performance in ""The Entertainer"" (1960), is one of the great film performances of all time.  A great actor in a great role, Olivier's Archie Rich is so memorable in it's subtle, sad humanity  you wonder why movies aren't more often as right on as this.  It is because  it was the perfect role played by the perfect actor at the perfect time in  his career. Olivier said this was the film role closest to his heart. His  depiction of the vaudevillian actor stuck in the purgatory of a tacky  English seaside resort (the Myrtle Beach of the English 40's; if you  haven't been there in place you've been there in spirit) is so brilliant it  is no wonder it never receives popular praise, that Olivier did not win the  best actor he was nominated for or that the movie is left off of everyone's  best 100.  Movies are suppossed to be flawed.  By not pretending to be  anything it's not, by leaving out symbol and putting everything in words  ""The Entertainer"" may put us closer to the stage than we're  comfortable with.

705552,5,6303682979,"I gave this film five stars because it is undoubtedly Olivier in his finest hour.
I recall reading an article in which he stated this was his favorite role of all time and when you watch this film you will see why;
Most people are not accustomed to seeing him appear as Archie Rice, a sleazy, and not very talented song and dance man.
He is a has-been that is hanging on for dear life as the world around him moves forward while he clings to the music hall repertoire and relives his past with cronies (including his youngest son) that hang out in the local watering hole telling off color jokes and picking up chorus girls who get younger as Archie gets older.
It is also a real treat to see Alan Bates, Albert Finney and Joan Plowright in their film debuts.
They play his three adult children who seem to have a job of it trying to keep Archie in line.
I had never seen the actress that plays Phoebe (Archie's wife or live in) and she also does a first rate job in this film.
It is a little slow in the first scene but stay with it and you will be happy you did.",1370908800,,1064,4.1201923076923075
705553,5,6303682979,"As an American, getting a peek at post-War Britain in decline, a look at Olivier as a most interesting character in the person of never-was vaudevillian Archie Rice, and a look at several British players (Joan Plowright, Anthony Bates, and Albert Finney) very early in their careers is priceless.

Archie Rice is a despicable character, and the drama centers on his problems of having all of his financial issues - including some long overdue tax debt - come to a head just as he can finally get no more work as a vaudevillian even in the bad music halls. He has a way out - one of his relatives will pay off his debts if he'll accept his drunken wife's nephew's offer to run a motel in Canada. But like any Briton who can remember England's finer days he's just not about to cut and run, and even though I can despise the lying, the cheating on his used up wife, his odd ideas about parenting, and his willingness to use his own father, I can't help but admire his ""pioneer spirit"" to use an American term. He'd rather fail on his own terms than succeed on someone else's.

Joan Plowright is the other lead, and she plays Archie's daughter, Jean. She shows some pioneer spirit herself. She shares some characteristics with dad - she's a painter who can't paint, Archie's a vaudevillian who can't entertain. Unlike dad, she owns up to her shortcomings and wants to make a contribution anyways by teaching art to poor slum kids. She has a way out of Britain just like dad does. Her fianc&eacute; has been offered a job opportunity in Africa, and he encourages her to leave her dead country behind, but she just isn't ready to give up on England or her family just yet. The two have a falling out and Jean goes to visit her dysfunctional family, in which she finds comfort.

I just don't get people who say that they don't like this one because it's boring, depressing, ugly. Every minute of this film held my interest and stayed with me long after I'd watched it. I think you need to have lived awhile, to have had disappointments, and to have dealt with those disappointments in ways you may not be proud of to really appreciate this film.",1369440000,,2139,4.47948717948718
705647,5,6303682979,"This is a really tough film to watch because its so utterly depressing. Its a film about desperation. A rather average music hall performer is trying to hold on admid the collapse of his entire world. Music hall as a performance form is reaching its absolute end around 1956. Even the resort towns in which he performs are worn out. But Archie Rice keeps on performing no matter what the cost.

I think its without a doubt the best film performance of Olivier's career. Its also possibly the only thing written by John ""Look back in Anger"" Osborne that I would consider a good work. Its tragegy in an almost classical sense. What sets it apart from many other works of Osborne is that the desperation creates sympathy for the main character which is something missing from (for example) ""Look back in Anger"". But the sympathy is mixed up with other emotions as ""Archie"" drags down everyone around him. Its also probably Tony Richardson's best film as well.

There are obvious allusions made to Britain in the 1950s and the whole notion of imperial decline. The Suez (1956) war goes on the background. But the allusions are too obvious to really be interesting. The work is as powerful or more powerful with the nationalistic/period ties. Its a story as old as the final collapse of the Roman or Persian Empires. Its the desperation of a last stand among the ruins and the associated questions of how high a price should be paid to keep something going. Its a point that I don't know how many films about the end of slient films have never been close to making. The allusions to emigration (to Canada) as a solution in 1950s ""austerity Britain"" are more effective in terms of the story. I also think that it would have been an even more effective story had a been a good performer. Because in the situation, good, bad or average as a performer, music hall (like Vaudville in the US) was finished and so was his world.

Its a rough thing to watch. Very depressing and utterly negative. But very well done.",1366761600,,2003,4.589385474860335
705648,5,6303682979,"If you have ever doubted the sheer genius of Laurence Olivier this is the film to watch. His Archie Rice is an intense and utterly moving foray into the manipulative mind and overall cheesiness of a third-rate entertainer desperately trying to redeem a career on the skids.
  Olivier was the first of his generation of actors to be willing to play a modern, entirely compromised character and his bravery in this regard gives us what may well be his greatest performance.",1359504000,,471,4.802469135802469

The simple plot of a die-hard Vaudville-style Performer and the effect he has on his extended family (both up and down the family chain).  Falling upon hard times is nothing new to Archie (Sir Laurence).  All the sub-plots (and there are many) all center around Archie and he isn't dealing too well with any of them.  You can literally watch this bastian of sleaze disintergrate as the people around him suddenly start gaining some importance and self-esteem, perhaps too little and too late.

Joan Plowright (then Ms. Oliver) made her debut as Archie's daughter.  Albert Finney is in the fantstic cast too.  Off screen, this group were playing ""switch-partners,"" which eventually caused a divorce (Oliver & Plowright) and a marriage (Finney & Plowright).

705653,5,6303682979,The demise of a seedy music hall entertainer is a metaphor for the decline of post-War Britain. A real showcase for Olivier - this rejuvenated his career. Beautifully photographed and strikingly directed with carefully framed scenes sometimes including both foreground and background action - also features excellent use of sound.

705654,4,6303682979,"Laurence Olivier stars as a sleazy, third-rate music hall performer in 1960's ""The Entertainer"", one of the first and best films of the so called Free Cinema movement, and a movie that is somewhat neglected today (it should be better known). Based on a play by John Osborne, Olivier plays Archie Rice, a mediocre performer in grim seaside town theaters. His shows attract few people (early in the film, we see passersby sneering at the theater marquee that falsely advertises Archie as a television comedian). His father, Billy, was once a talented and successful comedian, but now he is just a cranky old man living with him and Archie's wife, the unstable Phoebe. Archie has three grown children, played respectively by Alan Bates, Albert Finney and Joan Plowright, all very early in their careers. Jean (Plowright, who would become Olivier's wife soon after this film) comes to home from London and sees her family unraveling: one of her brothers have been sent to Suez, her stepmother is becoming more and more unstable, Archie is hounded by his creditors while he imprudently starts a romance with a beauty contestant, with the hope of obtaining financing for his shows from her rich parents. The film goes downhill from here, so is quite bleak, but it is very well done (and especially, performed). Some critics see Archie as a metaphor of postwar England, and this may indeed have been Osborne's intention, but the film plays better as a character study of a very flawed man.",1200009600,,1482,4.884920634920635

705721,5,6303682979,"""The Entertainer"" is a pivotal film in the career of Laurence Olivier. Before this 1960 film he had been a handsome leading man, receiving Oscar nominations for his performances in ""Wuthering Heights,"" ""Rebecca,"" ""The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with his Battell at Agincourt in France,"" ""Hamlet"" (for which he won,"" and ""Richard III."" After ""The Entertainer"" his nominations were all for character roles, beginning with Archie Rice in this film and then for ""Othello"" (performed in makeup as a Negro), ""Sleuth,"" ""Marathon Man,"" and ""The Boys From Brazil."" Performing the film adaptation of John Osborne's play, Olivier restaked his claim as the greatest actor of his generation by adding modern drama to his collection of work in Shakespeare and the classics.

Archie Rice is a bitter character, without any noticeable redeeming quality besides the attempt to survive. He is a comic whose routines are not funny, and perhaps once upon a time, in the early days, they were a put-on, playing a bitter person taking out his anger on the world. Either way, the act is for real now and is a p[itiful] figure. Archie works in a seedy music hall and has his eye on Shirley Anne Field (Tina Lapford), who must be a symbol of some sort of redemption besides simple carnal desire. Just as he ignores his audiences, Archie ignores his own family, who would provide an even more devastating critique of his wretched life. There is no sentimental side to Archie, who remains unflinchingly flawed unto the bitter end.

The film is directed by Tony Richardson, who had done Osborne's ""Look Back in Anger"" two years earlier and who would win his Oscar for ""Tom Jones."" However, ""The Entertainer"" is clearly representative of the ""kitchen sink"" style of film that characterized Britain's own ""New Wave"" cinema, which tended to focus on the growing decline in the quality of life in Britain after World War II. The cast features a young Alan Bates as son Frank, Albert Finney debuting as son Mick, and Joan Plowright as daughter Jean (within a year she would be the third and final wife of Olivier). Brenda de Banzie delivers a touching performance as Archie's wife, a bitter alcoholic, whose husband stopped loving her a long time ago. However, from start to finish the film is focused on Olivier's performance, which Olivier often said was the one of which he was most proud, being such a departure from his usual roles and work.

705722,3,6303682979,"""The Entertainer"" concerns itself with a sub-mediocre music hall entertainer, Archie Rice(Laurence Olivier), who in order to stay in the spotlight will do anything despite the ruination of the lives of those closest to him.  Olivier plays this character perfectly where the temptation to ham it up in the role of a sleazy entertainer he gives just the correct amount of understatement.  Also notable in the role of Rice's social worker daughter is Joan Plowright, who would become the future Mrs. Olivier.  Albert Finney distinguishes himself in the one-scene part of Rice's doomed paratrooper son.  Why I do not rate this film higher is that it is so unremittingly bleak and I just did not find the story that compelling to warrant this tone.  This film in my mind is a dated artifact from the British new-wave of the late fifties and early sixties when this type of realism was in vogue.  The film certainly captures the seediness of the world it is trying to capture.  To me it stands as a curio from mid-fifties Britain than as a film that will stand the test of time.",1104364800,10,1072,4.7005347593582885
705723,2,6303682979,"This was a very strange film developed in the 1960s.  The dark themes of love, money, greed, and overall the protagonist's dream of being the next big sensation were chilling.  This film was a perfect example of a very depressing story that never had a glimmer of light.  Sure, there are several times we think that Archie will taste success, but before he is able to put the symbolic spoon into the bowl, he is shot down harder and faster than before.  There is never a big break for Archie.  He represents the human in even the smallest entertainer.  As I read my local paper and see that Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg stopped at a local DQ earlier in the month, I can't help but realize the fact that this film is trying to show.  They are human.  While they may have more money and seen by more people, they are still human and have to deal with the human drama that we cope with daily.  Archie is no exemption, and his struggles with love, money, family, and success are just stronger realizations of his human element.  Add to this mix Archie's father and you see the true element of which I speak.  Archie's father represents a dying breed of actors that do not live grandiose lifestyles, but somehow live on just their name alone.  They have spent their money and rely on the kindness of strangers for favors.  This is where Archie lacks.  His kindness is only to women, and they continually hurt him in the long run.

Outside of the ""human entertainer"" concept, this is a very flat and shallow film.  From the opening scene until the end, we are never quite given the big picture of this family or our surroundings.  I never quite understood the scenes.  Where were we?  Why were we here?  Who are the people that do visit Archie's shows?  This builds a horrible background for our characters to live within.  Without the proper structure behind our characters this forces them to crumble with the slightest bit of force.  Archie's daughter Jean, the self-appointed narrator of the family, never seems to fit into her role.  Plowright never seems comfortable with her character and is constantly giving off the wrong emotion during the scene. There was one part when I swore I saw her laughing.  She is a distraction and a downfall for this film.  Secondly, Olivier needed to contain his character a bit.  I know that he was to portray an entertainer on the edge of reality, but it never showed.  He needed more control over his emotions and really build a human element to his character.  He was neither believable nor enjoyable to watch.  From the beginning of this film I never once felt like he could be successful, and when he is the character we are trying to rejoice over, we need to feel that sensation.  I needed to feel like he could really make this show work, instead of constantly being pulled deeper into his depression.  This goes with Archie's father as well.  It is possible to play too senile, and this is a perfect example.  The entire cake scene (when you see it you will see) was laughable instead of emotional.  The only character that worked decently well in this film was Phoebe.  She had a touch character to grapple with and it felt like Brenda De Banzie was the only one carrying her weight in this film.  Her emotion and power made some of the scenes worth watching instead of completely unbearable.

Finally, I would like to say that with the background taking second fiddle to the actors, and the actors taking second fiddle to the background, this band needed longer hours practicing.  Not only was this film confusing, but it also only allowed us to see one segment of the story.  I needed more pre-story information or possibly a better ending to really allow me to connection with Archie.  There was nothing forcing me to feel sympathy for the main character.  I didn't know enough about him, nor did I really feel comfortable with the family dynamics between him and Phoebe.  What was their relationship?  Plutonic?  Who knows?  All I do know is that director Tony Richardson did not have control over this film.  He seemed to slip between what his star player of the film (Laurence Olivier) and a developed story.  I do not see why Laurence was nominated for an Oscar for this role.  There was nothing spectacular.

Overall, maybe I missed the boat on this film.  Perhaps I was expecting my first Laurence Olivier film to blow me out of the water, but instead all I found was a jumbled mess of papers.  I understand that the world of entertainment is not as glamorous as we think it is, but it is not as depressing as Richardson shows in this film.  I needed a stronger balance and a better cast to make this film work for me.  I needed to see some reason for me to attach myself to Archie, but sadly there was nothing.  This film failed for me, but I will not give up on Olivier, I think he can prevail.

On a side note, maybe it is just me, but I thought that Olivier in this film resembled Robin Williams in not only the way that he spoke, but also the facial mannerisms.  Odd, maybe it is just me...

705724,5,6303682979,"My husband and I first saw this film in London, as it opened, in 1960.  I was a young wife of 23, and Sir Laurence Olivier's moving and extraordinary performance (look in his eyes throughout), gave depth to human frailty, and made me cry then, and most recently, 40 years later, has made me weep again, for the human condition.
I felt that the character of Archie Rice was portrayed with all his flaws, yet, Olivier, was able to illuminate,through his superb acting, the tender, vulnerable yet rather caddish side of human life, which side seemed to demonstrate his extreme insecurity. Where Olivier really was so brilliant, I think, was that he showed the viewer that Archie really KNEW himself, deep down.  Olivier seems to let the viewer know that he felt inside of himself, that he was a failure by much of societal standards, and that, even personally, he had, somehow, failed to measure up to his own youthful expectations.
I believe this movie ranks with the play/movie ""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller -- It is about all of us -- about life.
All of the supporting cast were also outstanding.  I believe that this film will move the viewer, and make the viewer think at least, twice, about his/her own life.

Before this 1960 film he had been a handsome leading man, receiving Oscar nominations for his performances in ""Wuthering Heights,"" ""Rebecca,"" ""The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with his Battell at Agincourt in France,"" ""Hamlet"" (for which he won,"" and ""Richard III."" After ""The Entertainer"" his nominations were all for character roles, beginning with Archie Rice in this film and then for ""Othello"" (performed in makeup as a Negro), ""Sleuth,"" ""Marathon Man,"" and ""The Boys From Brazil."" Performing the film adaptation of John Osborne's play, Olivier restaked his claim as the greatest actor of his generation by adding modern drama to his collection of work in Shakespeare and the classics.
Archie Rice is a bitter character, without any noticeable redeeming quality besides the attempt to survive. He is a comic whose routines are not funny, and perhaps once upon a time, in the early days, they were a put-on, playing a bitter person taking out his anger on the world. Either way, the act is for real now and is a p[itiful] figure. Archie works in a seedy music hall and has his eye on Shirley Anne Field (Tina Lapford), who must be a symbol of some sort of redemption besides simple carnal desire. Just as he ignores his audiences, Archie ignores his own family, who would provide an even more devastating critique of his wretched life. There is no sentimental side to Archie, who remains unflinchingly flawed unto the bitter end.
The film is directed by Tony Richardson, who had done Osborne's ""Look Back in Anger"" two years earlier and who would win his Oscar for ""Tom Jones."" However, ""The Entertainer"" is clearly representative of the ""kitchen sink"" style of film that characterized Britain's own ""New Wave"" cinema, which tended to focus on the growing decline in the quality of life in Britain after World War II. The cast features a young Alan Bates as son Frank, Albert Finney debuting as son Mick, and Joan Plowright as daughter Jean (within a year she would be the third and final wife of Olivier). Brenda de Banzie delivers a touching performance as Archie's wife, a bitter alcoholic, whose husband stopped loving her a long time ago. However, from start to finish the film is focused on Olivier's performance, which Olivier often said was the one of which he was most proud, being such a departure from his usual roles and work. You might not think it is Olivier's greatest performance, but it is one of his finest.",1054512000,,2512,4.844186046511628

The sound was so muddy and indistinct I couldn't understand half of what the actors were saying; the cinematography was so blurred I had to squint to make out what was on the screen.  Like I said, I stopped watching after 5 minutes and tossed the dvd into the Goodwill bin. I'm ordering a different version of 'The Entertainer' (MGM - Vintage Classics); hopefully that one will be better.  It couldn't possibly be worse than this one.",1501545600,,609,4.663551401869159
