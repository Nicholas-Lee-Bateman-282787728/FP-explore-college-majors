I love indie films more so over mainstream, but Come on Amazon, let it be known that we are in store for director commentary. Film is un-watchable. I wish Amazon had it so that we could at least see more than just the opening credits. It would have saved me wasted money, time and energy!",1336694400,,411,4.493333333333333
8130917,4,B000GDWFNG,"American screenwriter, actor, producer and director Anthony Spadaccini who made his directorial debut with ""Aftermath"" (2005) which was the first part of his independent film trilogy called ""The Film Truth Collection"", has a powerful way of conveying a rather simple story which becomes larger and larger as it unravels, a more confident expression than ""Aftermath"" and a story about a group of friends who are going on a camping trip to celebrate him for winning an award at a film festival which is more straight forward and concentrated than the one in his feature film debut.

American filmmaker Anthony Spadaccini's second feature film is without exception filmed with hand held camera and shot in black-and-white. Its very dark look seems to overshadow the actors, but as the tension increases it becomes evident that this darkness is more than a stylistic choice. The darkness gives this movie a cryptic atmosphere which is enhanced by Falling You's music and it also singles out the importance of the dialog which more than anything drives this film.

The title of this dense narrative feature is very appropriate considering the director`s filming, which creates a genuine feeling of instability and the characters reactions to an unforeseen dilemma which creates a colliding confrontation. The acting performances is so credible that it often seems improvised and the level of realism makes this fictional tale a riveting examination of morality which works as a minimalistic psychological drama with elements of the thriller genre and a mindful study of character which examines themes like homophobia, friendship and loyalty.",1297209600,,1637,5.316602316602316
8130918,2,B000GDWFNG,"I almost want to apologize for this review because I feel in my gut that the producer/director really meant well. Unfortunately good intentions are not enough to make it in this world when you put out an inferior product and offer it for sale. (Still, I do admit to giving one more than the minimal single star rating because - and ONLY because - of those good intentions).

This kind of home movie is only interesting in retrospect if - PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a great example - you grudgingly issue it as a lark many years after gaining some sort of reputation or career in film. With a few possible exceptions like HEARTS OF AGE, I don't think it could ever work to do so when you're just starting to learn the craft - especially with a hand held video camera and with casting your drinking buddies to offer up frequently inaudible dialogue.

The story of a friendly camping trip turning tense and then going horribly wrong, the film owes something, I suppose, to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT but when all is said and done, BLAIR WITCH only LOOKED amateurish.

I am gratified that a young film-maker wants to seriously portray the ramifications of homophobia so I hope, after a few more years of experience and hard knocks, this producer will make a fully professional effort to study the issue - resulting in a product more people are willing to view from start to finish.",1248566400,,1371,4.520161290322581
