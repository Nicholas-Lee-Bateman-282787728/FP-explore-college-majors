8203985,4,B000S1MM7U,Anyone who wants to know what really is going on in this country and world should take a gander at this piece of the puzzle.,1389398400,,124,4.0
8203986,5,B000S1MM7U,Ms. George explains in detail how neo-cons are bringing back colonies in the southern countries without having to send in an army to maintain control in an abusive system while pretending the northern countries are giving aid to the southern countries.,1368576000,2,252,5.170731707317073
8203987,5,B000S1MM7U,"I knew of the things Ms. George talks of here but only in a vague outline. Here she puts detail to the IMF, World Bank and World Trade organization and it's some scarey stuff.

Here's the scoop. The U.S. (and parts of Europe) want to remain economic kingpins and the days are over for overt colonialization, so some really smart guys figured out how, using the above-mentioned organizations, we could subjugate poorer countries through economic blackmail.

This is very simple. Ms. George sits on a sofa and talks. Her speech is broken up into labeled chapters and she has at it. She is obviously bright and learned and speaks plainly. One does not need a degree in anything to understand what she says and she uses only enough facts and figures to bolster a given point. I was not bored in the least and what she said both saddened and angered me. How can any civilization be so callous as to keep entire countries from being able to develop on their own and make them, for all intents and purposes, slaves to those who have already developed? The IMF has come up a few times in other documentaries and articles and nothing I've seen or read is flattering to them. This documentary does not help their cause.

She also shows the downside of this short-sighted approach to world economics but the guys at the top still don't seem to be suffering from the ""boomerang"" effect as she calls it. It's us folk lower down the scale that become collateral damage.

This is well worth seeing. A real eye opener.",1358899200,3,1502,4.5724907063197024
8203988,5,B000S1MM7U,"I wanted to almost memorize the things Susan says in this documentary. She demonstrates in her easy way of speaking her deep understanding about the plight of those countries whom the world banks have loaned money and the roots of poverty in all countries, especially since globalization.  I highly recommend this video and I will be watching it again several times.",1348272000,,366,5.0
8203989,5,B000S1MM7U,"Usually, as soon as you mention the two words ""international economics"" to most people you observe the MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over) Effect. First of all, because most people consider Economics a mumbo-jumbo discipline reserved for people like Alan Greenspan. Secondly, most people don't know much about the flow of international capital and the workings of currency exchanges and don't see the connection between these and the circumstances of their daily lives. That is one reason why the ""Speaking Freely"" series of DVDs produced and distributed by Cinema Libre Studios is so important and germane to the concerns of our globalized economies.

Cinema Libre Studio founder Phillipe Diaz produces the series. The goal of the series is to provide conversations with some of the world's most celebrated thinkers so that the viewer can gain insight from their opinions on the important social issues facing our world. In the case of ""... Susan George"" a wealth of knowledge on the global movement of capital, what debt means on the international stage where nations act - something quite different for how it operates for individuals - and what forces are at play in the policy making of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are made accessible.

Ms. George, currently the Chair of the Planning Board of the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, is focusing on democratizing the World Trade Organization (WTO.) This becomes quite apparent during the conversation as she provides a wealth of detailed knowledge about international financial transactions and the flow of capital from the nations of the southern hemisphere to those of the northern hemisphere. (Yes, you read the last phrase in the sentence correctly, as you'll learn while watching this engrossing conversation.)

The irony of the situation will immediately raise eyebrows among some. Ms. George explains how the money flows and demonstrates that colonization by the sword has been replaced by colonization via the loan and an economic philosophy practiced by IMF and World Bank known as neo-liberalism.

If the first two installment's Mr. Diaz's ""Speaking Freely"" series of DVDs is any indication of what we can expect from the next few installments, this will be an important set of DVDs for anyone interested in social justice and the true of state of international affairs as we move forward in this century. This DVD becomes available for purchase from Cinema Libre Studio.
