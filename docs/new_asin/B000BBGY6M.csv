2411629,5,B000BBGY6M,It was great it shows you what can happen in A few seconds or minutes man made our natural disaster like in this film.  The effects were alright but the cast where excellent they showed even with fire or any dangerous thing how people will do to survive and help others.  I believe the cast and the film makers show us any thing possible.,1472256000,4,338,4.265625

2411632,5,B000BBGY6M,"What else is there to say; the package was shipped and received in a timely manner and in great condition. Also I do appreciate being able to find this movie. It is old, but one of my favorite.",1377302400,,193,4.105263157894737
2411633,5,B000BBGY6M,VHS movie was in good condition.  Picture a little grainy but excellent movie none the less.,1238889600,,92,4.75
2411634,5,B000BBGY6M,"If you thought that Irwin Allen's ""The Towering Inferno"" was something,YOU HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET!!!!!!!!! Like the other
2 reviewers have already stated,what's so frightening and plausible
about the plot to this film is that IT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN!When a
mentally-disturbed employee at an oil refinery decides to take his
vengeance out on an entire city in which the oil refinery is located,
move over Towering Inferno,because you've just been burned,as far as
special effects,scope,music,and incredible acting from a top-notch all-star cast! The cast includes: BARRY NEWMAN,SUSAN CLARK,SHELLEY WINTERS,AVA GARDNER,HENRY FONDA,LESLIE NIELSEN,AND JAMES FRANCISCUS to name a few! And considering this disaster movie didn't have near
the budget that Irwin Allen's did,just goes to show it doesn't
take millions of dollars to make a superior film in EVERY WAY!Also
be sure to check out the other disaster flick from the same people that made this one titled,""THE ACCIDENT"",which is also available
on VHS!!!!!!!!",1234483200,9,1010,5.607843137254902
2411635,5,B000BBGY6M,"It's amazing how few people realize that their actions due to powerful emotions can begin a chain of events that can ultimately paralyze a city. And that's what we have here. Head by top actors such as Henry Fonda and Leslie Nielson (before he bcame well-known as a comedic actor in ""Airplane!"") CITY ON FIRE is a disaster movie similar to Irwin Allen's 1977 TV-movie FIRE!. But instead of a forest fire started by a convict tossing a lighted cigarette onto old branches, an entire city is on fire -- hence the title -- started by a disgruntled oil company employee opening oil valves and dumping the oil into the city's water-line. And right in the middle of it all is a hospital in danger of being engulfed by the fire. Don't miss this one!",1184803200,13,742,4.503703703703704
8084839,5,B000BBGY6M,"Ordered for my wife because she is addicted to disaster movies. Cheesy, but good entertainment.",1504137600,,95,5.4
8084840,3,B000BBGY6M,"From 1979 we have a disaster movie not done by Irwin Allen. We have a fire caused by a disgruntled employee who was passed over for a promotion at a Chem/petrol/oil complex that the corrupt mayor allowed to happen right in the middle of town. Quite a cast to be sure, Leslie Nielsen, Henry Fonda, Shelley Winters, Ava Gardner, Barry Newman, Susan Clark and James Franciscus. The acting is what you would expect from an old disaster movie but allow me to say that the worst casting was an aging Ava Gardner as the alleged host of a news show and she is supposed to be a ravishing thing.....not at all and I loved Ava in so many things. She was ravishing back in the day but not here. The ending when we have to evacuate the hospital and its patients is wayyyyyyyyyy too long. I guess they ran out of story and stretched the end out to impossible agony.",1500595200,2,851,4.325
8084841,5,B000BBGY6M,It was expected as I wanted in a disaster movie.,1495152000,,48,3.9
8084842,5,B000BBGY6M,"Another great terrible movie from my youth!  This is a very hard film to find I was delighted that it was finally released to DVD.  Of course I only saw the televised version as a kid, and the full version once.  It is a great movie, almost as bad as ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".",1485734400,3,287,4.181818181818182
8084843,4,B000BBGY6M,"Good old tv movie. Picture could be sharper, but not bad. Sound is very good. Will watch again.",1482969600,,95,4.333333333333333
8084844,1,B000BBGY6M,"really bad transfer,black and white circles appear throughout the film,black line is visable on right hand of picture,do not purchase.",1482624000,,134,5.75
8084845,4,B000BBGY6M,"For fans of the 70's disaster genre, ""City on Fire"" is a definite must-see. You could of course complain about the probability of British fire engines responding to a fire in Canada (clips obviously taken from the 1971 film ""The Firechasers""), but why bother? It's entertaining enough and fairly realistic.

Best of all is the excellent quality of the transfer. This film has probably never looked as good as it does on blu-ray. If you have an old VHS copy, now is the time to upgrade. You will not be disappointed. Another important piece of information is that the blu-ray disc is playable in regions A, B and C.",1481932800,2,614,4.63302752293578
8084846,5,B000BBGY6M,I liked the dvd,1481328000,,15,3.0
8084847,4,B000BBGY6M,Oldie but goodie. Pretty good acting,1480118400,,36,5.166666666666667
8084848,5,B000BBGY6M,City on Fire is a 5 star movie staring Barry Newman with an all star cast very excellent movie from 1979 and the blu-ray is excellent.,1474934400,,134,4.1923076923076925
