8634013,3,B000SUXG4Y,"First, this is a cool collection of the Kraft Music Hall Shows with Bing et al. However, the sample rate of these recordings is as low as 22khz in some cases and does not duplicate the way the master tapes sound. I assume this is to get as many shows as possible on one DVD. What is unique about these programs is that they were originally recorded on Ampex tape - stunning quality compared to others still using lacquer discs to save shows. Unfortunately this collection does not preserve the fidelity of the programs the way that some other vendors do. If pristine (original) quality is important to you, heads up.",1249171200,,616,4.558558558558558
