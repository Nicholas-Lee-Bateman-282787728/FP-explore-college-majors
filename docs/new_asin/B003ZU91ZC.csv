Also, it was great to have the feeling of learning something new, which I never found using other dvds. Knowing how to juggle has giving me a way to relieve stress, improve my health, and impress my friends. I'd definitely recommend this dvd if you'd like a great light workout while also exercising your brain.",1284595200,3,412,4.363636363636363
8410992,5,B003ZU91ZC,"I've had several people try to teach me to juggle over the years, but I never could get it. I thought I'd give it another try, and that learning from a fitness instructor might be interesting. I'm glad I did. The DVD gave simple steps that were easy to follow, and I enjoyed learning with the juggling scarves that came with DVD. I've noticed that juggling has had a positive effect on my ability to concentrate, as well as my coordination and reflexes. I'm think I'll buy this for my mother for Christmas!",1282348800,2,506,4.451612903225806
8410993,5,B003ZU91ZC,"I am in my 40's and enjoyed this Juggling video. It provides detailed instruction along with plenty of time for practice before moving on to the next piece. The included scarves helped me focus on learning the concepts without worrying about speed.

I appreciate how the instructor was proactive in understanding where I might be having issues and revisiting solutions for making movements more fluid. It helped me solidify my technique and was like she was in my living room!

I would recommend this video to anyone wanting to explore a new and fun mind/body work-out.",1282348800,4,569,4.916666666666667
