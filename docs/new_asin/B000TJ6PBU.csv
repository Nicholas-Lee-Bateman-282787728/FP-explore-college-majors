2902214,4,B000TJ6PBU,"If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you.  Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, ""1408"" is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.

John Cusack gives a tour-de-force performance as Mike Enslin, a successful writer who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity with a particular emphasis on hotel rooms that have the reputation for being haunted.  The twist is that Enslin is, essentially, a nonbeliever who spends most of his time and energy debunking the very subject off which he is making his living.  The 1408 of the title refers to a room in a swanky, five-star Manhattan hotel in which, we are told, no fewer than fifty-six guests checked in but never checked out, having met their untimely demises there in the decades since the establishment opened.  Determined to put an end to the ""foolishness,"" Enslin moves into the room convinced he will ride out the night in utter peace and safety.  He has, of course, another think coming.

As adapted by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, ""1408"" succeeds mainly by keeping it straight and simple and by concentrating with laser-like focus on the character of Enslin and his relevant back story.  The multi-layered plotting keeps us guessing from first moment to last, so that we never quite know whether what Enslin is experiencing is really happening or whether he is suffering some form of mental breakdown brought on by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent breakup of his marriage a few years back.  Along with director Mikael Hafstrom, the master craftsmen responsible for the film's phenomenal art direction and sound recording draw us into the strange world they've created where nothing is quite what it appears to be and where we spend most of our time nervously scanning the edges of the frame to see what surprise is next poised to jump out at us.

Cusack, who has long been underrated as a performer, gets the chance to really show us his acting chops in this role.  He allows us to clearly see the fear and vulnerability hidden beneath his character's wisecracking, cynical exterior.  Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack also excel in the small but pivotal roles of the wise hotel manager and Enslin's estranged but faithful wife, respectively.

For those who can remember a time when fright films had more on their minds than simple gore and grue, ""1408"" is like a refreshing, restorative tonic on a hot summer day.",1183420800,3,2561,4.941724941724941
2902215,3,B000TJ6PBU,"First of all, I have to confess I'll see nearly  ANY movie with John Cusack in it. I'm not sure what it is about him as an actor that holds my attention but after seeing him in a wide range of films, I find his versatiliy, his ability to play a broad spectrum of characters and to keep  pushing the envelope and explore new territory to be intriguing. Don't get me wrong - I don't have a crush on him. He's an actor. I'm a reviewer - don't know the guy.

Now, ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I read the short story in King's collection and have to say that the movie takes lots of creative liberties but that's fine by me. It holds true to the essence of the story. I happen to like this in book form better but that is because it's taut and doesn't waste words. Besides, it is easier to linger on a certain passage, until it is seared into the imagination.

  Still, the movie has its fine points as well. As mentioned before, there is John Cusack, who definitely comes across as a skeptical writer who becomes genuinely spooked by his experiences in Room 1408. His acting is as interesting as usual, pulling out all the stops, with those quirky facial movements that can suggest so much about a character without saying a word.

I found the special effects to be less impressive and the movie seemed to go on forever. But that's my main problem with adaptations of King books to screen. Sometimes they work beautifully and other times they fall flat. I think this one is somewhere in the middle.",1183075200,6,1483,4.351449275362318
2902216,4,B000TJ6PBU,"My wife and I went to see 1408 the other night. It was a birthday gift--otherwise she'd never have gone. She hates horror movies.

Interestingly, we both ended up enjoying the movie.

I read (or should I say listened to?) the short story prior to seeing the movie. Much like I prefer the movie version of the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer the movie version of 1408.

John Cusak is great. He usually is. Samuel Jackson gives a wonderful performance. Whoever the little girl actress is--she also did a remarkable job.

The ending rocks (I promise I won't spoil anything).

What makes this movie a little stronger than most horror fare is this:

1. The pacing is great. Things never go over the top by being too intense for too long. This has been a big issue in horror films lately. They lose their suspension of disbelief from too much emotional weight. I don't know about you, but I find myself mentally withdrawing from such stories to come up for air. When I re-engage, much is lost.

2. Speaking of suspension of disbelief wreckers...there is very little gore here. In this movie, when gore does come, it usually comes in the old photos. I feel this lack of abundant gore strengthens the pyschological impact of the movie as a whole. It also prevents the movie from turning plain old silly like recent gore-fests along the lines of The Hills Have Eyes.

While this is not my favorite Stephen King adaptation--Shawshank still reigns there--1408 is a solid, intelligent and emotionally resonant movie. You will not be wasting your money if you go to see this over the 4th of July holiday.

I give 1408 a strong recommendation.

PS- This also gets the award for best use of a Carpenters song in a horror film since In the Mouth of Madness.",1182988800,122,1740,4.62012987012987
2902217,4,B000TJ6PBU,"When hearing the plot for this film, The Shining is most likely to come to mind. And even after seeing 1408, I still wonder how Stephen King could pull off this story with it being so similar to his other classic evil hotel tale. However, 1408 does have its own creepy style that will make the audience jump several times and is definitely worth seeing if you are a King fan or just enjoy a good scare.",1182729600,,402,4.233766233766234
2902218,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Treading the familiar Stephen King territory of a writer thrown into the horrors of supernatural chaos, 1408 is more Shining than Misery, but Cusack retains the redeeming pathos-inducing personality of the latter's troubled novelist. Choosing to use atmosphere and mood over blood and guts to increase suspense, Mikael Hafstrom's thriller admirably shies away from cheap scares and ghostly Ring-like little girls to slowly build a searing psychological terror where the audience might lose their cool before Cusack's character does.

Mike Enslin's (John Cusack) tragic past provokes him to seek out the most notorious of haunted houses and other typical phantom hangouts and debunk the existence of such afterlife entities. After writing several less-than-successful ""top 10"" haunted locale books, Enslin happens upon a postcard warning to stay away from room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. Unable to resist, Enslin insists upon staying in the ""evil"" room that has claimed 56 lives and boasts a foreboding one-hour maximum life expectancy for its occupants. Ignoring the pleads of the Dolphin's manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin embarks on a nightmarish night of supernatural torment where he must battle impending psychosis, paranormal devilry, and his own inner demons... and he may not last ten minutes let alone one hour.

Perhaps its greatest accomplishment, 1408's emphasis on atmosphere and setting over blood packets and gore effects keeps it refreshingly new though its premise dabbles in the horror stories of old. Those expecting the elaborately grotesque tortures of Saw and Hostel may be disappointed in the psychological terrors that reign supreme in this haunted hotel room, but just as effective (if not more so) is the steady building of unbearable torment on Mike Enslin's rapidly crumbling psyche. And through his faltering rationalizations, we too begin to lose our calm. Once the mysterious happenings transform into supernatural disturbances, the likes of which Enslin can no longer pass off as cunning trickery from the hotel manager, he must face his inner demons as well as the deceptive visions brought forth by the hellish room. When the inevitable jumpy scares finally do arrive, we're so worked up by the terrifying setting and nerve-wracking mental deterioration of our protagonist that we jump even higher out of our seats.

As Cusack's character changes from stubborn skeptic to mortified victim, his surroundings shift in appearance as well, almost like a less drastic Silent Hill, where the walls crack and bleed and an icy chill blankets the room in frost. The usage of such visual change in setting (especially later, when stormy waves flood the room) helps to keep Enslin a stranger in his surroundings, and therefore the audience as well, even though the film practically takes place all in one small location. The normally static environment becomes an unpredictable location where anything can happen.

1408 is virtually a one-man show, and Cusack embodies the perfect victim and empathetic host to the horrors unfolding. At first he is obstinately confident in the nonexistence of ghosts and such supernatural phenomena, but as the notorious one-hour time limit counts down (thanks to an unnerving alarm clock with a mind of its own), Enslin realizes just how wrong his assumptions were. An ingenious plot device has him dictate his thoughts into a tape recorder, allowing the audience to participate in his initially logical thought process that quickly deteriorates into a frantic rationalization of the eerie events he witnesses, and ultimately the realization that he will die in the cursed hotel room.

Though infused with plenty of cynical humor, the steadily increasing dread can't be shaken from Hafstrom's clever adaptation of Stephen King's short story. An inspired performance from Cusack keeps the suspense high and the hope of escape low, and the rising fear and paranoia parallel such horror greats as The Shining and Audition (as do the skillful psych-outs that toy with the audience and Enslin). And while our protagonist may be able to talk his way out of being frightened by the terrifying events unfolding (at least for a short while), chances are the audience won't be able to do the same.

2902219,5,B000TJ6PBU,"""1408"" is excellent! The cast led by John Cusack (in a great performance as Mike Enslin) and Samuel L. Jackson (as Gerald Olin) is great.

2902220,3,B000TJ6PBU,"I have always been a huge Stephen King fan, and I'm happy to say that 1408 is not a bad adaptation by any means. The story does feel a little recycled from The Shining, but mainly because it deals with a hotel and the evil spirits that haunt it. The acting is pretty good, but some of the dialogue could have used some work.

Worth your dollar on a rainy day.

3 out of 5 stars",1182556800,3,377,3.9473684210526314
2902221,4,B000TJ6PBU,"In a Haunted Hotel story, it always starts with a warning: Don't stay in that one room. It's haunted. It's evil. Such is the way that ""1408"" starts, an opening that inevitably leads to a series of nightmarish supernatural occurrences. But rather than bombarding the audience with cliched images of ghosts and monsters, the film effectively gets under the audience's skin by adding uncomfortable subtleties. Example: there's a moment when John Cusack passes a painting while in room 1408. He sees that it's slightly crooked. It wasn't like that when he first entered the room. Moments such as these build up as the film advances, resulting in a story that doesn't shock so much as it unnerves. In short, this is a film that takes us on one heck of a ride.

And no wonder; it's based on the short story by Stephen King. In the collection ""Everything's Eventual,"" he introduces ""1408"" by saying, ""hotel rooms are just naturally creepy places, don't you think? I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many were losing their minds?"" I must admit that I don't put much thought into hotel rooms. Still, such unpleasant ideas ring true. The filmmakers must have known this; those very words were used as dialogue for Cusack's character Mike Enslin, a man who makes his living writing about reputedly haunted locations. Following the death of his daughter, he no longer believes in anything, least of all in ghosts. When he learns of New York City's Dolphin Hotel and the history behind room 1408 (whose digits add up to thirteen), he only sees it as an opportunity to add material to his next book. He intends to stay overnight.

The manager of the hotel--Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson)--desperately tries to talk Enslin out of it, as such characters do in such stories. Room 1408 has been associated with many deaths during the Dolphin's ninety-plus year history: there was the sewing machine salesman that slit his own throat; there was the man that drowned in a bowl of soup; there was the woman that jumped from the room's window. Today, no one stays in room 1408. The only people who enter it are the maids, who give the room a very quick turn every month. The sheets are changed. The towels are replaced. The light bulbs are fixed. According to Olin, it's similar to holding your breath in a room filled with poison gas: everything has to be done quickly. This is because no one who stays in that room will last for more than an hour. Something is in that room. Not a ghost, but definitely something.

Enslin listens but refuses to reconsider. He sees Olin's words as nothing more than scare tactics, a way to drum up publicity for the hotel. Olin insists that he's being quite serious. Whatever the case, Enslin eventually receives the key to room 1408, an old-fashioned metal key that fits into an old-fashioned lock (the hotel has upgraded to magnetic cards, but according to Olin, nothing electronic will work in 1408). The room is located on the fourteenth floor ... but actually, it isn't. During the elevator ride, Enslin notices that the floor numbers go from twelve directly to fourteen; apparently, a thirteenth floor is highly frowned upon in many hotels. Either way, Enslin enters room 1408.

Thus begins a highly intense, horrific journey, highlighted by unexplainable occurrences, terrifying images, and otherworldly encounters. I won't bother describing them in detail: for one thing, it would be difficult to do so; for another thing, you really should experience this film for yourself. Let's be incredibly vague and say that many strange and frightening things happen, all of which force Enslin to reexamine his state of mind. For the horror movie aficionado, this film is delightfully unsettling, filled to the brim with pop out scares, spooky sounds, and startling twists of fate. At the same time, it utilizes smaller, quieter moments, such as when Enslin bathes the room in ultraviolet light, exposing large areas that were once covered with blood. In the hands of a lesser director, all this could have amounted to mere shock value, great to look at but lacking any substance.

Luckily, there's genuine imagination at work in ""1408,"" so much so that it begins to get overwhelming. But that's how it should be; Enslin is learning the hard way, and the audience needs to be aware of this. Ultimately, I felt the same way leaving the theater as I did when finishing King's original story: thrilled. It doesn't matter that this film adaptation isn't completely faithful to its source; the story served more as a springboard than a strict guideline, allowing for many ideas to be expanded and solidified. When Cusack's strong performance is added to the mix, it gets even better; for most of the film, he had to act while alone in a hotel room, surrounded by a wealth of special effects. Nonetheless, he shows terrific range, relying on an emotional gamut that's just as convincing as it is intense.

""1408"" is one of the better Stephen King adaptations of recent memory, a carefully crafted fright fest that knows how to make the audience uncomfortable. It's engaging, exciting, and genuinely terrifying, perfect for anyone in need of a good scare.",1182470400,5,5217,4.836506159014558
2902222,4,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is a well made ghost story with John Cusack as a writer who wants to write a story about a motel room that many people have died in. He actually stays in the room expecting it to be not that bad since he has stayed at haunted places in the past. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the motel manager eventhough he's short and white in the short story I think but while reading it, I pictured Samuel L. Jackson anyway. Samuel L. Jackson adds more humor and sarcasm to the part though. Anyway he's both creepy and funny in the small part as he practically begs Cusack not to stay in 1408 adding some hilarious Samuel L. Jackson style curse words. Soon after arriving in 1408 Cusack realizes that 1408 is the real deal and as much as he'd like to leave the room won't let him.

  The ghosts in 1408 can look like prejections from the Haunted House in Disney World, so they aren't that scary. But there's still pleanty of moments in the movie that will make you jump. The movie is also very entertaining but mostly due to the great work from John Cusack. He can make you laugh pleanty of times but the movie can also have it's emotional scenes which he handles fine as well. I admit there's a scene at the end where he had me close to tears. Despite some scares, the movie really wouldn't have been as good without him.

  Even if you read the story, there's no one else you can picture who's as perfect for the part. If you're not sure what Stephen King book you can find the story in, it's in Everything's Eventual by the way. I still have to finish it, I started reading this week before I saw the movie. I'll have to see if the ending is the same but here I really liked it a lot. The movie is worth checking out, that is if you're not expecting a whole lot of blood and guts and just want to see a movie with a good story.",1182470400,3,1822,4.132768361581921

2902383,5,B000TJ6PBU,"This is a must-watch for horror-thriller fans. It may not be all the way up there with The Shining, but this is definitely one of the best Stephen King film adaptations I've ever seen. I'd never watched a John Cusack movie before this, and his acting is absolutely pitch-perfect (which it needs to be, since he's alone onscreen for most of the movie).

This is one of those horror films that goes for a creepy atmosphere and psychological thrills over gore and/or jump scares. In other words, it's one of those truly scary movies that also happens to be artfully written and produced. I actually liked the film more than the original short story.

I do prefer the theatrical ending over the director's cut, which is what you're getting here, but both radically different endings have their pros and cons.",1494374400,3,804,4.735714285714286

He's a solid actor but fails to really stretch himself. Combine that with subpar movies and I came into this one with low expectations. Low enough that this is a movie I've been wanting to see but refused to until it came to Amazon Prime. As a member I wholeheartedly dug into it. I wasn't disappointed. It keeps you on the edge of your seats and you find yourself more interested in the characters that make up the room, i.e. the previous residents. The color of the movie was outstanding as it wasn't dark and the acting overall was solid as well. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.

John Cusack is superb in this thriller and he gets all of the credit for making King's writings become true to life on the screen.  There's something unique about Stephen's twists and turns that makes him one of a kind.  very film he is involved with keeps me on the edge of my seat.  This is a must for King fans!  A must!  I've had it for many years but just now got the opportunity to lock myself away and become part of this chilling ride.  All 5 stars.,1480550400,8,621,3.904

2902820,3,B000TJ6PBU,"Unfortunately, this was just an ""okay"" movie. The scare factor was mild and the character seemed to go through psychological processing of his past rather than dealing with the events in the room. The history of deaths in the room seemed to drive Samuel Jackson's character into not wanting to allow John Cusack's character to be in the room, and though those deaths were mildly hit upon, they were *only* mildly hit upon. It was that history as to WHY those people killed themselves and why the room was so-called ""evil"" that drove me to want to watch the movie. The movie turned out to be a narrative of only what was going on with the Cusack character, instead. Some ghosts made their appearances, and one quick-shot scare at the end, and due to those reasons, I really would not recommend this movie.",1478131200,,804,4.629370629370629

Watched this recently, and was surprised that the ending was reverted to the director's choice for the Blu-Ray/Amazon Prime streaming of the film. In my earnest opinion, the updated ending shown here completely eliminates the tone of the film. Call it bias, as I really and truly enjoyed the film as I saw it in theaters, but this ending shown here ruins the film for me.",1477872000,8,551,4.359223300970874

My suspicion is that perhaps it picked up a following because it is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Truth be told, this movie is simple clich and predictable.

2903000,4,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 while being an interesting film that held my interest had its own set of downfalls. While taking a refreshing look at horrors by coming from the perspective of a skeptic haunted hotel  writer it still held some common tropes and cliches of the modern horror industry. At times during the film, I was unsure of whether I was watching a horror movie or a mind twisting version of Inception. I believe one of the largest downfalls of the film was playing so far into the haunting of the room that it no longer seemed like it was the actual room that was paranormal. Beyond the hallucinogens and somewhat trippy experiences of the room, after the main protagonist seemingly vanquished the room there is a tease that some of the haunting still remains in his personal belongings, which destroys the entire aspect of the room being the subject of the haunting.
However all in all I was kept on the edge of my seat and startled my fair share. I would give it a 7/10 and would probably watch again.",1476662400,,995,4.527777777777778

2903290,2,B000TJ6PBU,"""1408"" is almost good, but it just misses the mark. The film runs too long to sustain the atmosphere they are trying to build, and while the cast is good, I think the film would've been better with Cusack playing the hotel manager and Sam Jackson as the writer.

Mike Enslin travels the country staying at, and writing about, the haunted hotels of America. Mike is a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, and would love to have a genuine ghostly encounter, but so far, he's just sensationalized his stories and packaged them together in book form. It seems that Mike was at one time, an up and coming author, but due to a family tragedy, he's left serious writing behind.

Mike gets a postcard from The Dolphin Hotel suggesting he come and stay in room 1408. Mike thinks this is just another hotel looking to catch some free publicity in one of his books, but soon finds there is more to 1408 than the usual ghost stories.

I liked King's short story that this film is based on, and I appreciate who the film makers fleshed out the story. And I also appreciate that ""1408"" isn't found footage (seems like this would be a ripe tale to tell using camcorders and iPhones), and it's not a jump-scare-a-thon like the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. They actually try for suspense and chills instead of just giving loud noises as things appear on screen.

With that said, ""1408"" is actually a pretty dull film. Way too much time is spent on Mike's backstory, and as the events of Mike's life unfold, we may be saddened or sympathetic to Mike.....but we aren't scared.",1471478400,,1564,4.575

2903406,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Modern horror has gone through many different phases and while ""1408"" is not as flashy, loud, or as gory as many modern films; Stephen King's story and the adapted film still is an effective look at what is one part psychological thriller and one part haunted house. While the premise of ""1408"" is simple, the success of the film is carried largely on the dissection of its main character and the dialog (at times literally) established with the room itself. Much like the worlds of ""Silent Hill"" or ""As Above, So Below"", ""1408"" is populated by the shades and ghosts of its current occupant. And while much of the past still is present in every action the room takes to breakdown it's victim; the viewer is left to try and establish just what exactly is going on and where the line between reality and delusion ultimately is. For many this film may seem dated and not as edgy as modern horror films, strong scenes i.e. (Jackson warning Cusack to stay out of room 1408) still do a nice job of building up actual tension even before the main event has even started. Although ""1408"" does show its age and some of the scares are hit and miss, it still offers an interesting look into the journey of overcoming one's personal demons and is worth a look.",1469145600,2,1248,4.5265486725663715

Movie was made or released in 2007, and we've all had plenty of time to learn all of the horror/thriller memes. Let play parapsychologist for a moment, ok? As soon as the window slams on his hand, and the vanity sink water becomes scalding steam, and the radio turns on spontaneously with ""It's only just begun..."" he has to know there is something different about 1408. He is such a stickler for being rational, so...why doesnt he write down, journal all the events up to the point of the door lock not turning, and the key breaking, and then take methodical drastic measures. We all know from movies like Christine that when radios turns themselves on, there is a haunting in progress. Ditto for doors that were functional moments ago, refusing to open. Basic horror trope stuff. At that point, Mike needs to jot everything down on paper, and on his laptop, and on his audio recorder: the window slam, the scalding tap, the spontaneous radio, and the door lock failure, key breakage. At that point, he loses it and it becomes special effects and dreamland/memoryland/fantasyland stuff. All he needed to do, was disassemble the bed, and remove one steel rail, and use it to batter the thinner door panels until they break, and crawl out of the recalcitrant doorway, and he's out of the room. He failed to stay calm after each weird manifestation, take stock of what is happening, and think slowly and carefully. Because of that, he missed using a simple lever or a battering ram to exit the door. Riskier, would have been igniting a towel drenched in alcohol on the end of his battering ram, and setting the door ablaze and then kicking it when it was weak. Multiple pragmatic solutions to get out of the room with a phantom-locked doorknob, and he opts to go crazy, drink more, and just react instead of act. Very disappointing once he enters 1408. I wrote this review as catharsis. I get it...the room was ""supposed"" to get him, ergo, he's not allowed to think up ways to get out of the room that make sense.",1469145600,,2088,4.645945945945946

As far as bad horror movies go 1408 is surprisingly decent. I can't say too much without spoiling it, but the attempts at horror here actually work okay for a one-man show. The movie is never particularly scary and the main character isn't very likable or relatable, but the writing manages to convey a psychological threat. Apparently this is based on a short story, and it shows in the quality of the writing.

If you get a chance to rent it (or watch for free through Prime) and you're into horror films you might as well try it.",1468195200,,694,4.588709677419355

2903505,4,B000TJ6PBU,"This is a very good film, and not just for a horror/thriller either.

John Cusack plays a skeptic, who writes books about the most haunted vacation spots there are.  He doesn't believe in anything.  No ghosts, no ghouls, and no gods.  He receives a postcard about room 1408, and decides to check it out, even though he ""knows"" he will find nothing.

Samuel L Jackson plays the hotel manager, who does whatever he can to try and convince Cusack not to stay in that room in the hotel.  He believes the room is evil, and perhaps even alive.

Cusack stays, and the horror begins.  There aren't any monsters popping out at you, though there are a few startling occurrences.  You won't see Freddy or Jason, or anyone horrifically covered in scars.  It's more of a subtle horror.  Cusack does well in his role, making you believe he is seeing what we see.  The torture is supposedly never ending, with only one way out.

Over all, 1408 is an excellent example of what a horror movie can be, without all the cheap thrills.  It has an entertaining story, and some interesting characters.  It's worth a watch.",1467072000,4,1099,4.564102564102564

2903560,4,B000TJ6PBU,John Cusack continues to show his versatility & range in this film; especially since he is literally on screen the entire time.  His portrayal of a jaded haunted house profiler with a spooky past is quite fascinating & appealing.

I'm only guessing with the Acid, but I can vouche on behalf MJ.  Not only is this movie creepy, but the story is nicely done.  I mean it's almost as if it was copied straight from a book, which in turn was written by a talented and successful author- whose books I can never bring myself to read.  That's the thing about King's work; it always pushes my buttons on what I feel is taboo and superstitious.  This movie really activated my fight-or-flight response without really overwhelming me.

The projected images of older times in black and white displaying previous tenants jumping from the building was a bit much as it seemed to connected to that being portrayed from a television set.  I liked the deviation of the story from the original story and it did a great job of portraying the lead as a prisoner.

I was a bit disappointed in the ending, however, as it was !not! the ending that I watched when the film came out in theatres, nor was it the same as the book.  I found that disappointing in that it appeared that the producers of the film attempted to make it some how more unsettling, but I found the original ending much more clever.",1465257600,,776,4.398601398601398

For the Amazon price of entry, if you love movies like... Poltergeist, The Shining ... The Haunted... Amityville?

You should really like this. John Cussack great as usual, he brings a coolness to this film, also Samuel Jackson also keeps the cool factor going.

2903835,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I've seen this twice and even enjoyed it the second time.  It's an often overlooked gem of a thriller (horror?) movie with two good lead actors.  I was attracted to the idea of a total skeptic of the paranormal/ghosts taking the challenge to stay in a room with a reputation for killing it's tenants.  The movie does a good job of pacing the tension such that it steadily grows to a final climax and the main character is given a chance to develop as this happens. I'm a Stephen King fan, and this movie is based on his story.  It really isn't a horror movie so much as its a psychological thriller that makes you question how you would react if you were in such an impossible situation?

2903895,1,B000TJ6PBU,"This movie is about one thing: COGNITIVE DISSONANCE."" That is the inability to accept the truth even though it may be backed up with evidence, documentation and, most importantly, HISTORICAL precedents. The hotel manager (Jackson) tried to tell Enslin (Cusack) not to take room 1408. He gave him hard evidence of what happened to people who stayed in that room. A whole lot of it. He finally gave one last heart-felt plea for him not to stay in the room. So what does Enslin do? He did what any pretentious, jaded, egoistic, pompous, know-it-all hack would do. So guess what? He was warned. Just like any know-it-all who watches mainstream media and believes everything they're told by the sock puppet news casters (spell-casters is more appropriate) and wonders why things NEVER GET ANY BETTER AND ONLY GET WORSE.

If you tell a child not to put their finger on a hot burner, some very inquisitive children may try to test that ""theory"" before they believe it. Good for them. They now have empirical evidence and will not do it again. But try telling a physically sick adult something about the poison junk they call ""food"" they eat every day and wonder why they get sick and stay sick. Try telling them about the lies perpetrated by the mainstream regarding current false-flag events (See screen shot from this movie. Remind you of anything?). They call you a ""conspiracy theorist"" at best. Oh well, they were warned. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Happy voting.

Every movie made in holly wood (sic) is rampant with occult symbology and correspondences. Take the number, 1408 (and does anyone really have to write it down to add up four numbers like he did in the movie?). So they add up to 13. Oh, ""unlucky 13."" Well, it's also the card, Death (XIV), in the Tarot deck. Maybe that's how it became so unlucky. ""2254 Lexington Ave"" (the address of the Dolphin Hotel) also adds up to 13. Guess they really want to push the Death card. But what does 1 + 3 equal? Four; the Emperor in the Tarot (IV). Why is this important? Because emperors (rulers like presidents) are responsible for a lot of innocent people being killed, even though they get their order-following minions/lackeys to do the actual killing in MOST cases (hey, learn from House of Cards). They are psychopaths.

It's no coincidence that Enslin mentions ""the banality of evil,"" from a book by political theorist Hannah Arendt called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eichmann-in-Jerusalem-A-Report-on-the-Banality-of-Evil/dp/B001RHOJSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil</a>&nbsp;originally published in 1963. It's not really funny that Eichmann said he was ""just doing my job"" about planning and executing the murders etc of millions.

But what about the zero in 1408? Card 0 is The Fool. The Fool means a lot more than what the name implies but the surface meaning is obvious.

Anyway, it's funny that the Emperor card should come up. ""Enslin"" happens to be an anagram for Lin Sen; Chairman of China in 1932. He was called by Time magazine ""puppet President Lin"" in 1934. I don't know for a fact that that's what the writers of this movie intended, but it is a very strange coincidence. Hmm, know of any puppet presidents from the US? I do. Every one of them from the day JFK was murdered by the CIA and military.

I could go on and on about other things I noticed in this movie but what's the point? No one is listening. Hey, enjoy your stay. Don't say you weren't warned. And congratulations to all the five star and one line reviewers. You are legends.",1461628800,5,3679,4.916264090177133

2903919,5,B000TJ6PBU,I have to give this 5 stars! We have watched the 6 or 7 times since the movie came out... Who but Mr. King could make a hotel room scary.... TWICE!... You could easily be tricked into thinking this is a repeat of The Shining... but 1408 has a story of it's own... And it managed to stay scary but not gory! All too often horror movies get it wrong now a days... they think the trick to scaring is to make it vomit worthy. I don't  equate the two. Just because I can't watch your movie while eating a plate of Spaghetti does not mean your movie was AT ALL scary... I prefer the mind bending scary. The scary that makes you think... The scary that makes you question if you have possibly met a serial killer... or ... how much do you actually know about your neighbors... LOL... This has enough scary with a limited cast and scene's... So EPIC in that department as well...You have to give them credit for doing this film without much of a travel budget. I don't want to write a review that tells you ABOUT the movie... I want to write a review that makes you wonder what's in that movie that I haven't seen!?

A sign of lazy writing is when a movie breaks it's own established rules for the sake of expediency. 3/4 of this film had me at the edge of my seat thinking this is the best thriller I've seen in a while. Then the stench of ""let's wrap this up quick"" took over the ending... up to that point nothing he had done in the room made any impact in the ""real"" world but when he lights the fire at the end that somehow burns down the room in the ""real"" world...uhhh ok.",1459468800,,560,4.146788990825688

2903988,1,B000TJ6PBU,"A pretty ridiculous premise for a movie.  The plot is about a writer who specializes in debunking haunted building rumors.  He doesn't believe in the supernatural.  He gets a postcard from someone about this hotel in New York that has a very haunted room in it.  He sets out to debunk the rumor for his next book.  The hotel manager vigorously tries to discourage him from staying in the room, citing all the previous deaths but this is viewed by the writer as ""salesmanship.""  The writer checks in and the room goes to work on him.  The room seems capable of altering reality and perceptions of it but no explanation is given as to what power is behind it.  Its tactics are dastardly and it seems to somehow have intimate knowledge about the writer's deepest fears and issues.  The enemy throughout the movie is clearly ""the room"" itself and there is never any suggestion of what power is behind the room's haunting, which makes this plot quite unbelievable.  Most supernatural thrillers invoke a spiritual world which contains intelligent entities who are bent on doing humans harm, but a constructed room simply can't do this with any stretch of the imagination.",1459296000,,1165,4.78

2903996,2,B000TJ6PBU,"Not the best Stephen King movie-from-fiction I've ever seen. The plot is simple. A hack writer who likes to write books about haunted places gets a recommend about a particular hotel room -- 1408 in The Dolphin. The head concierge of the hotel tries to talk him out of staying the night, but this writer has heard everything before. He's a complete nonbeliever and very angry. He refuses to listen, and stays in the room.

The rest is just an escalating series of supernatural events, climax and denouement. I won't detail it all because too many spoilers. I didn't think the events were all that imaginative. Stephen King can do and has done -- much better work. I thought the events in the haunted room were poorly strung together and rather plotless. I don't like being creeped out just for the sake of being creeped out. There needs to be a reason, a story -- something -- that can connect me to the haunts and weirdness. This was disconnected. I laughed through a lot of it because it was so over-the-top for no particular reason that I could discover. I liked the hack writer goes to haunted hotel beginning --that was a good place to start.

The movie has come out with 2 different endings which drastically change the movie. I prefer the original ending I saw at the theatre when it was released in 2007. This edition on Amazon is NOT best ending. The original ending leaves you with a glimmer of hope for Mike Enslin. This ending is sad & gloomy.

I was not a God fearing person when young much less a godly one I was supposedly a normal teenager but every other word out of our mouths did not begin with ""f"" neither was it like that in the movies. Today's films do NOT reflect ""reality"" for me it's not the world I live and move in and it has never been and I've lived in some pretty bad worlds.

John Cusak does a pretty good job. Samuel Jackson works at the hotel, never really sure who he is or what he does. The story starts out as expected with things moving around, and goes way off into dreamy nightmare land by the end. It's dark and moody, as a horror movie should be, but I can't say I understand any of it in the end. So, if you don't care about story line to much, okay. Otherwise, you're constantly left trying to guess whether he's having psychological problems or he's having a really bad day with some kind of ghosty thingy.",1456531200,,698,4.376923076923077

It's not Cusaks fault. He did an admirable job with the script he was given. Bad writing, bad direction, Bad....ending.

Everything about this slow-burn horror flick is very well done, but the main attraction is John Cusack's excellent performance as paranormal myth-buster who is, quite literally, taken down by an ""evil f*&king room"". It's Mike Enslin v. Room 1408 and, given that it is an excellent Stephen King penned tale, you already know who is going to win. That's the trick, the treat is watching it happen - watching the supremely confident Enslin literally unravel before your eyes, and watching the excellent special effects-supported process of the room, quite literally destroying him mindy, body and spirit.

One of the best things about this film is absence - nothing happens, but the psychological tension builds anyway. It's a sorta sophisticated horror film, and I think it goes beyond genre film-making (a stupid categorical label anyway) because beyond the horror aspect there is the matter of a father who has repressed the mourning of his daughter's death, and you don't know if room 1408 is real or if it's a man learning to liberate himself from his own personal demons.

2905354,2,B000TJ6PBU,"I really enjoy 'ghost stories'. Haunted house stories are ones that really draw me in. So when I saw this movie by Stephen King I thought this is one I'd probably really enjoy. Unfortunately it was not the case at all. It had such great potential. A story about a man named Michael who wants to spend the night in the dreaded room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel could have been loaded with real scary stuff. Instead, it was a complete let down. I am not one for gore or sex in movies so in that aspect it was fine. But I AM wanting to be scared. This story had mostly to do with Michael spending the night in a room (by the way, 1408 adds up to 13 in a hotel floor that doesn't have a 13th floor labeled) that gives him flashbacks of his young daughter's death. Oh, you see a few black and white transparent ghosts that just look at him and leap out the window. And there seems to be some kind of phantom who you see a few seconds at a time who swings an axe at Michael. There is also some kind of ghost who chases him for a short time in a furnace duct but that's about it. If Michael is haunted by his own family's past, fine. But I don't care about that as a viewer. It doesn't make me cry or go crazy. I wanted to see ghosts unexpectedly come out from somewhere to give me a fright. I wanted something to shake ME up. Unfortunately it wasn't there at all. One thing about me is that I am a bit backwards from other people. I would rather watch the movie first and then read the story because if I read the story first it kind of ruins the movie for me. After I saw this movie I read the short story (In Stephen Kings' book 'Everything's Eventual'). The short story was better and had some scarier images. I also saw how the movie had to add lots of unnecessary filler that could have been used better to keep him in the room longer with scarier images. Sorry, but this just was not even remotely scary. I know there are reviewers out there who found it to be scary. That is fine. Horror is different for everyone. It does take more to scare me in movies. Many people thought the movie ""The Conjuring"" and even its sequel ""Annabelle"" very scary. To me, they were both just dramas with little scares at all. Stephen King has some good stories even though I don't think they are scary at all. 'Christine', 'Pet Sematary', 'The Shining', 'Misery', 'The Mist', 'Cujo', 'Storm of the Century', 'Salem's Lot' all come to mind. I like those stories very much. But none of them scare me in any way, shape or form. Even if this wasn't scary it still could have been a good story to read or watch as the ones previously mentioned. But this one fell flat on all accounts for me. It reminds me of 'A Good Marriage'. That had a great premise as well. A woman who finds out years after she is married that her husband is a serial killer. Wow, what a great idea! Unfortunately that too was a complete waste of time for me. Sorry, but I doubt I'll be re-watching this one.",1441324800,,2954,4.166083916083916

In Wells' story, the suspected ghost is not a ghost, and the action takes place in the room of a supposedly haunted castle; in this film, the suspected ghost is a ghost, and the action takes place in a supposedly haunted hotel room. The differences in quality are many, but the primary one is that Wells could write, whereas neither King (who wrote the short story ""1408"") nor the screenwriters (who wrote the screenplay of the film) can.

Although it was not a true adaptation of King's book, The Shining was in my opinion, the ultimate thrill.... which brings me to my point, 1408 might've done some good if Cusack was replaced by another actor who could actual convince an audience that he was a skeptic and a writer. He just made me angry because he lacked delivery of emotions. I love Samuel L. Jackson but this is one film he didn't need to be in because his character was pointless. 1408 is ""supposed"" to be about an evil room and in my opinion failed to show me exactly what was so evil about it. After watching this movie, it just seemed that Cusack's characters guilt got the best of him.

I especially want to thank the Director Mikael Hfstrm for his ability to convey in this film the spirit of Stephen King. Here there are no ridiculous and cheap tricks, which are usually intended to invoke fear in the viewer. On the contrary, the film begins carefree. We are introduced to with writer named Mike Enslin, who skillfully played by John Cusack. His character became famous for books about the paranormal. But Mr Enslin skeptical about the possible existence of ghosts. Oh, how wrong he was! The fate brought him to the hotel room 1408, which was infamous. He was warned about the dangers associated with staying in this room. But as a true skeptic, Mr. Enslin didn't believe and decided to spend the night in this room. From that moment, we, the viewers, will together with the hero, to go through a lot of intense and mystical scenes.

2905512,5,B000TJ6PBU,"The reason I give this film five stars is that it legitimately creeps me out every time I watch it.  John Cusack does an amazing job delivering a panic'd and terrified man.  The mind games this movie plays with the character truly give you the feeling of someone going crazy, and instills ones true fear of losing grasp of reality.
Samuel L. Jackson plays a small role in the film and is not overused.  I don't want to speak to the ending to avoid any spoilers, I had my issues with it but felt it was fair and tied in nicely.  I have seen this movie numerous times and enjoy it every time I revisit it and love showing this off to people for the first time.",1427760000,,658,4.15748031496063

I personally enjoyed it. It's more of a psychological thriller with a good acting on the part of John Cusack.,1423785600,,266,4.235294117647059
2905597,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Somebody challenged me when I reviewed The Machinist because I looked at his review and he said that 1408 was way better, much scarier.  I saw The Machinist and I love that film however I wanted to see why somebody said that.  I'm thinking 1408 will never live up to his praise.  So I put it on and at first I'm like this isn't that scary, this isn't that great.  But that's because it tricks you into relaxing into it and then it gradually scares he hell out of you!  And when you think you are safe again you are not. I saw Annabelle and that wasn't so scary.  Psycho is very scary and I would put this movie in that category at least.  Also, by the time this film ends I appreciated my life more than ever before.  Also there is probably nobody who just watched this film that would dare give the 1408th review.",1423267200,,814,4.173076923076923

I always prefer the movie over any book.
There are books worth reading, but never think that a movie would be created to match the book.
Book is not art just words that are minds dissolve, movies are art. Eyes, ears and mind work together to make the form of art.

Watching this movie was good until the it stopped being realistic. Made this film a 2 part film.
The first was realistic, the second just fantasy.

I prefer the realistic first part. Following the writer to places he investigates and writes his findings.

This does have some fear in it. If you fear hotel rooms. Which has made me rethink the lonely hotel room, and the fear it brings.

Which is all this really is creating is the fear of being trapped by yourself in a hotel room, never to leave.

Just don't like the fantasy being used to haunt rather the lonely room.",1419897600,,952,4.448275862068965

There is such a sense of uncertainty about the events, it may never be clear what was real, what wasn't, and when the whole thing started.  For instance, how did that guy pass the same places twice before he even set foot in the room?  Maybe the room's influence is much greater than the hotel manager thought.  As for me, I freak out whenever I hear a song start playing unexpectedly anymore.

I just love the symbolism in the song.  Talking about how they've 'only just begun' 'to live'?  Genius.  And the part about sharing new horizons when the room gets really nasty.  Please don't accept the express checkout, though!",1417651200,,721,4.5625

In 1408 you really get to see his range. He starts out cocky, then gets a bit scared, then his soul is downright devoured by the evil spirit he first denied existing.  Nearly the whole movie is him acting alone, everything from his facial expression, body expression and delivery of his lines takes you into this room with him.

Very oddly written, utterly confusing, and many of the issues brought up were never worked out. There are also two endings, one is the director's cut, the other is the theatrical, I guess.

2905804,2,B000TJ6PBU,"So, I did the dumb thing and read the short story just before watching the movie, so take that into account when reading this review.
The movie itself was watchable, if a little disjointed and somewhat hard to follow, but saying that it's based on Kings story is more of a cruel joke than an accurate description.
Two characters in the book made it into the movie, but since they were the only two chacters in the book (the writer and the hotel manager), it would have been impossible to leave them out.  Apart from that, I counted 3 vague references to the book.  3.
The film makers added several chacters, presumably for us to hate.  The ex-wife made me want to punch her in the face within 2 minutes of being on screen.  When your ex calls you, obviously freaking out and tells you to call the police and save his life, you don't start whining about how he didn't call you when he got into town.  She was begging to be hated, which seems to be the only reason she was in the movie - because trying to build a background for the writer failed miserably.
Then starts this whole thing where the room tries to convince him he seeing his dead daughter, and he starts to lose it.  again, adding characters to the story that weren't needed.
I'm just disgusted with this movie.  The book made the room a truely malevolent entity.  The movie made it a kinda creepy and surreal place to be, it was so watered down if I didn't know it was based on the book I never would have recognised it.  The stupid film didn't even get the pictures on the wall right!!!!
Things that really pissed me off because it wasn't supposed to happen: He left the room (at least he thought he did), he interacted with other people while in the room, he was able to contact people outside the room, he crawled around the freakinig vents and found a dusty corpse that of course (in crappy, predictable movie fashion) came to life and chased him through the ducts, the list could go on for as long as the movie, which seemed endless.
Honestly, it was such a struggle to watch the last half hour, I didn't think I would get through it, but I had to see how much more the film makers could screw up the story - and on that point they take the cake, all of the cake, even the crumbs.
Then the writer dies at the end, which wasn't supposed to happen, and the story was much more disturbing knowing that for the rest of his life he had to sleep with the lights on so when he woke from his nightmares he instantly knew he was not in that room any more.
John Cusack delivers an amazing performance, and is really the reason to watch this movie, the only reason.  He is believable, genuine, and with all the other things I hated about this film, I still found him compelling.
Sam Jackson was good as well, but his character was poorly written and in no way resembled a hotel manager.

Conclusion:  Skip the movie and read the story.  (Don't worry, America, it's a short story)",1401926400,2,2935,4.3145454545454545

That being said- let me just say this.  The story line involving Enslin's daughter is not in the short story and really detracts from the film.  There is simply no need for it.  The mellow drama and the ""cheese aspect"" that Enslin's sniveling family-dynamic brings to the film is the only reason this film is not in my top 10 of all time.",1401840000,,497,4.477777777777778

2905811,5,B000TJ6PBU,"First, there will be NO SPOILERS here. Yes there is more than one ending to the film, and people differ wildly in their reactions, but I'll say that each alternative ending leads you intrgued and wondering and wishing the film could continue on for more.

Cusack is at his best here, because with the exception of a  'bookend' setup-scene and concluding appearance by a truly creepy and ambiguous Samuel Jackson, this is a one-man film. Cusack is onscreen, alone, for the entire film. And he's brilliant here.
The closest acting achievement (carrying an entire film singe handed) I can recall is Tom Hanks in 'CAST AWAY'.

Cusack is a jaded, cynical writer whose niche is investigating (and debunking) supposed 'haunted hotels'. When he checks into Room 1408, everything seems mundane, just another rundown hotel on hard times whose Manager hopes to bring in traffic with some 'haunted room' publicity. But then...
Is the room truly possessed by an evil intelligence? Is Cusack hallucinating? Has the hotel Manager somehow drugged him? Is he losing his mind? The film supports any interpretation you choose.
Special effects are remarkable, especially considering this is a one-room set, with virtually the entire film taking place within the walls of Room 1408.
But the real brilliance here is an intelligent plot, a psychologically complex and multi-layered script, a truly gifted actor in Cusack, and more (I promised no spoilers).
'1408' is infinitely re-watchable, and each time you'll catch a nuance, a clue, a misdirection you missed the first time. Be sure to watch it with someone, you'll want to discuss it for hours afterwards.

2905839,5,B000TJ6PBU,"I don't normally like (or watch) nightmarish video.  This is yet another poltergeist horror film, but with psychological suspense rooted in the protagonist's own personal grief.  So it feels real even while it isn't.  A ghost or spirit, in classical literature may be more accurately imagined as a shade or shadow of the person which once was.  While I don't thrive on spooky stories, this one fixed my attention on the screen, palms sweating in supense.  The protagonist is a self professed atheist who's lost his daughter (and his marriage) to a childhood disease.

As a Christian, I'll hazard to venture upon extra  Biblical traditions, and notice that some American native cultures include traditions of the spirit of the deceased remaining for a prescribed time among family and friends.  But untimely death may cause a spirit to linger aimlessly.  To the Christian perspective, the parent and child in this story are lost (wanderers), but not aimlessly.  In some ways, the purity of her ghost is what causes this story to transcend the boundary lines of pointless living or pointless death.

Christian scripture omits any instance of a God who pounces upon human souls, demanding, ""what did you do with my son?""  What one does in life is, rather, the foundation or essence of what one's life becomes, in present and future time events.  Our mortal frame doesn't fully calculate the power of love, on the horror in this tale, where love, a team venture, intrudes more terribly than  the sickness of death.",1396137600,,1510,4.940476190476191

2905870,5,B000TJ6PBU,"For those who don't know, this movie was based off a short story of the same name written by Stephen King back in 1999. The story itself is about a skeptical writer Mike Enslin (played by John Cusack), who travels the country trying to debunk ghost stories by visiting haunted houses and anything purported to be haunted. In the movie he is bitter and atheistic after the untimely death of his young daughter from some type of cancer. Then one day as he is sorting through his mail he comes across an anonymous postcard featuring the fictional 'Dolphin Hotel' built in 1912 (1910 in the book) and on the back of the postcard it's written ""Don't enter 1408"". Mike Enslin takes this as a challenge and tries to get access to room 1408 but finds that the hotel manager has forbidden anyone from entering the room because of all the people who have died in that room (56 in all). Mike uses an old civil rights law to bypass the hotel's rules and manages to get inside room 1408. It isn't long before things start to get very surreal and very insane. And the worst part is the room won't let Mike escape.

The room isn't haunted, rather the room itself is encompassed by some malevolent supernatural entity that manages to get inside the minds of the people who go into the room and ultimately causes them to commit suicide. Whether this entity is a demon or something else entirely is never made clear. What also doesn't make sense is the origin of the entity which is never explained. For example, how is a single room that's not even on ground level just happened to randomly be possessed upon its completion. It's just that specific room in the hotel that's the problem, not the hotel itself. And since the room is 13 stories up (not on ground level), it's not as if there was anything that happened in that particular space where it was built. That particular space was air before the room was built. These are questions which I have and will never get answered but which add to the mystique of the story itself. How does a room become evil? It's as if the room just somehow became a portal into another dimension, a dimension we would probably think of as Hell since in the movie it seems as if Mike Enslin is experiencing a kind of Dante's Inferno plotline as he finds himself deeper down into a colder and darker and even more inescapable situation. The room becomes more and more of a prison and more and more surreal.",1391040000,,2422,4.479638009049774

2905941,3,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is a difficult film to judge. John Cusack stars as a man who specializes in debunking paranormal occurrences in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. It is fairly loyal to the original Stephen King short story and has two great actors, Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, but it doesn't quite work overall as a horror flick because some of the visuals hurt the movie (e.g. when we see the ghosts and other paranormal activity). There isn't much in the way of gore, violence or shocks so it works more as a psychological thriller. By all rights it starts out by building a decent amount of tension but it doesn't really pay off. It just does not come across because we don't feel emotionally involved in the film despite some good performances. Jackson isn't really in the movie enough to share billing with Cusack. Some scenes are downright dull despite having a fairly good premise and set-up. It is probably 15 minutes too long for its source material. The Blu-ray picture quality is average but the sound is fairly good. The original theatrical cut of the film is missing on Blu-ray (only the unrated version is provided) but the theatrical ending is available as a bonus. There is 44 minutes of total bonus content.

2905966,4,B000TJ6PBU,"The secret to good horror is not gore and gratuitous violence; good horror is about a tight, gripping, tense story that finds its protagonist not confronted by wave after wave of meat cleaver violence, but confronted by the sheer terror that has been planted in his mind.  Accordingly, 1408 was quite the treat; I caught this film on cable and instantly was attracted to the story of a writer who doesn't believe in the supernatural, and writes stories basically debunking paranormal occurrences, getting scared out of his gourd while staying in the infamous Room 1408 of the (fictional) Dolphin Hotel in New York.  And Room 1408 throws the proverbial kitchen sink at the writer, almost from the moment he checks in--from faucets exploding super hot water to blood oozing from the walls.  And during the haunting the writer (played masterfully by John Cusack) is forced to confront, and relive, the most painful experience in his life.

Cusack is completely believable as paranormal author Mike Enslin.  The actor brings the right mix of skepticism, incredulity, and self-deprecating humor to this role.  Mike Enslin is becoming a believer in the supernatural right before our eyes, and is it ever fun to watch.  Samuel Jackson is his usual antagonistic best playing the manager of the Dolphin Hotel who tries, without success, to convince Enslin not to go to Room 1408.  It's a surprisingly small role, but Jackson brings his usual in-your-face vigor.  The story is suspenseful and compelling, again sans the meat grinder gore, with one star off due to the complete predictability of the faux resolution Enslin encounters.  The real ending sends goose bumps down one's spine, making 1408 a most satisfying horror yarn.  See this movie and it will change your perception of The Carpenters forever.

2905972,3,B000TJ6PBU,"As I usually do, I found John Cusak to  have done the best he could with the material he had to work with. Jackson had little  more than a walk-on in one scene, not anywhere near enough to warrant co-star  billing. He did well with the little he had to do. My problem with the film was that all the artificiality was showing, that is, it was like watching the rehearsals for a play, seeing all the backstage business, and reading the script while seeing the production falling into place.  I never was led to believe that this was a movie of a NYC hotel in which  a lot of stage business was going on.. Perhaps a better analogy is that of a magicians assistant who knows the mechanics behind every trick.
In sum, I can't say for sure, but there is a good chance that a fan of this kind of  movie is not going to be able to take it very seriously. I didn't but, then, I am not a fan of the genre.
Postscript:  Just watched it again after some years interval in which I have completely forgotten ever having seen it. Perhaps I have grown less critical as a very old man, but I did find it much more appealing than I clearly did at the first viewing. It is still a distance from first class and certainly overwrought ..........but now I would recommend it to everyone who goes for the spookier, less naturalist film.",1375142400,,1313,4.248995983935743

He stays in a hotel room that is supposedly evil and finds that the spirits in the room turns all of his secrets and fears on him and shoves it down his throat. I would like to say the room isn't evil per say, but a trial of the spirit; testing the will of those with the courage to stay in there, because in the end it is your choice whether you live or die.

What's that, you can't imagine a room filled with.... *nope not gonna tell you and give it away!

If you go in expecting a solid plot and jump type suspense moments or your standard horror movie I think you will be disappointed. If you go in just wanting to be entertained and not caring if you have moments of ""oh there is no way they just did that! Come on!"" and then can't tear away because you just gotta see what the heck they are gonna try next? This is for you. It doesn't have to make a lot of sense and you don't care if the ending maybe ticks you off. (I read there are two alternate endings for this someplace) Overall it was a visual good ride and interesting to watch John Cusack in this type of role. I also think whoever wrote or did the visual concepts for this had to have some kind of drug experience with how the scenes and all played out, think Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when the carpet is all melting because the guys tripping on LSD.

The story in this film is straightforward. It uses supernatural (was that a ghost?) and psychological (is it all in my head?) elements to create an effective horror atmosphere. There's suspense, creepiness, and many jump scares spread throughout the film, along with a few great twists in the plot. The setting is also fantastic, as mentioned in the film, hotel rooms are naturally creepy; room 1408, however, is a special case as it changes constantly - the weather conditions, particularly, change often. Basically, the film works great as a psychological and a supernatural horror film. The music is also magnificent. The acting was also great. The pace is moderate during the first 30 minutes, then it goes into a very fast pace.

Overall, 1408 is an exceptional horror film that masterfully executes its supernatural/psychological blend, packing a creepy and constantly changing setting and a lot of scares. A purchase is highly recommended for fans of horror, a rental otherwise.

2906016,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Probably the most accurate translation of one of Stephen Kings books to film since Misery.  More of a ghost or haunting story than horror but rest assured it's wonderfully terrifying.

A long time fan of John Cusack (and his sister Joan) Mr. Cusack turns in an incredibly layered and focused performance as  Mike Enslin  an unhappy more or less washed up and washed out author of haunted places.

His past which we see in both flash back and unsettling recreations explains the reasons for his the disgruntled attitude which masks his pain - the performance is superb.

Samuel L Jackson as the hotel manager Gerald Olin, does what he does best and that's deliver a commanding performance. Tony Shalhoub provides a bit of comic relief but laughs are few and scares are plenty.

The Dolphin hotel is as much a character in the film as Cusack - I have to be careful here in not giving anything away but it's like The Shinning in that the Overlook Hotel had a life of it's own as does room 1408. The feeling of dread when Cusack enters the room is palatable.

There is no gore here, splatter fans won't be happy. This is a thinking horror fans movie armed with genuine scares from a rich woven plot.

Director Mikal Hafstrom (The Rite) leads us into an ominous world of twists and unexpected, truly frightening moments, the effects are outstanding and the film is peppered with images that will haunt you long after the final credits have rolled.

2906019,4,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is one of those movies you're either going to really love or really hate. It's long, and at times, not easy to sit through, but if you're a fan of Stephen King, you should be used to that. This is vintage King and it's done right! When people don't like the movie, right away they go after the writer. They don't realize that a lot of times things are drastically changed to make them more visually appealing. In a horror flick, that's usually means tits and/or gore, which are out of place in a King story. 1408 has none of that, it's just a good old fashion horror story about a room that possesses it's residence. The acting isn't going to blow you away, there aren't very many surprises as far as the story goes, but it's a scary story, done the way the master of horror intended and I liked it!",1361577600,,804,4.261437908496732

He proceeds to hang out the window for 20 minutes, while ghosts jump out over him. Then, the room begins to go crazy, as you would expect. There isn't a single jolt in the entire film.

This movie, although King claims it is one of his favorite adaptations, is frankly a mediocre attempt at everyday horror cliches.  We have the dying child, the worried wife, the concerned boss, the aging father.  None of these appeared in the original story, which was a ten or so page chill fest. This is a movie that wanted to be good, but failed miserably.  John Cusack as the protagonist going to pieces was great, don't get me wrong.  If they had given him King's material to work with, Cusack would have been great.  But Hollywood as usual scotched the deal by introducing a sentimental undertone that pretty much shiprwecked the story line.  (Pun intended.)",1350172800,,769,4.644444444444445

2906043,1,B000TJ6PBU,"I am always craving a good horror/suspense movie so the premise of 1408 was interesting.  However the movie falls far short of maintaining coherency, even early on.  Cusack, while tremendously talented in other features, just is not strong enough to lead in a movie with supposed gravity, especially paralleled to Sam Jackson and a severe lack of supporting characters which his quirky acting style benefits.  The plot, while has potential, quickly becomes cliche and muddled. The pacing has us racing from once scene to the next without plausibility or explanation, this causes apathy towards Cusack's character as he undergoes his plight, since we have to do the movie's job and piece things together instead of focussing on the interactions between Cusack and the room/his psyche. All this mess only leads up to one of the most nonsensical climaxes and endings I have seen.  I cannot think of any positive things to say, the acting is weak, the plot is a mess, the pacing is awful, and I cannot recommend this to anyone.

This is a great haunted/possessed place movie.
I've seen quite a few and I am a discriminating
horror cinema fan.
I loved this movie the first, second and third times
that I watched it and I hope to watch it again.

The acting, cinematography, sound, special effects,
story, etc. are all excellent. I cannot think of
any negatives.

Is it scary? Yes.
Is it simply a vehicle for shocks? No
It has an excellent plot and characterization,
and it delivers the goods as the room experience
goes from bad to worse to way out there.
It is an expertly plotted and paced movie.
Everything works to deliver precisely what
this type of movie ought to deliver.

If you are interested in an intelligent, scary,
emotionally wrenching, non-exploitative (sic)
horror movie, you can't go wrong with this one.

Another recommendation for a scary apartment room:
""Dark Water""
(both the Japanese original and the American remake are excellent)

2906047,5,B000TJ6PBU,"In a way, you'd have to feel sorry for Mike Enslin. After a couple devastating losses, he makes a living trying to debunk hauntings all across the country and writing his cynical views and selling them. And, apparently, makes good money off his skepticism. So, after getting an invitation to try out a hotel with one single warning, he ignores the warning and goes to the one forbidden room in the entire hotel. Room 1408. What makes it forbidden? Everyone who's ever checked in had died after going completely insane. Impossible. At least, in Mike's eyes, it is. When he first checks in, he makes fun of all the stereotypes behind famous hoaxes and cliches (and is rather funny doing so). But, in next to no time at all, gets psychologically attacked all over by the deranging room in every way possible. Things that defy every form of physics he's ever known that's trying to push him over the edge (and sometimes, it's a wonder if he actually he does go over). In a very strange way, Mike seems to go through his own version of Dante's Inferno.
What makes Mike's character unique is John Cusack. 'Nuff said. A very versatile actor that can pull off many different types of people. And, in this film's case, pull of a huge emotional range and have a unique transition from full-on skeptic with bulldog tenacity to losing his edge and be one second away from pulling his hair out in total frustration and confusion. Plus, some of the looks he pulls off is pretty creepy, giving his arc of insanity that much more a realistic grit. Samuel Jackson, on the other hand, is pretty straightforward, which is good for mysterious character, the owner of the Dolphin Hotel. As his usual style, he gives off a cocksure way of knowing things and crass tone if he doesn't get his way, but this doesn't get in the way of his character, it seems to enhance who he is. Mike, the washed-up cynic who's never experienced the supernatural and is intent on proving there's no hope just because he lost his one hope of being a father versus a man with a bizarre connection to the most haunted room in all of America.
Oh, wait, there's also the Director's Cut, which isn't really all that different... save for the ending scene. Which is, in the true paradoxical sense of the word, is bittersweet.",1342569600,,2277,4.583333333333333

There is no real gore or violence (some suggested) so if that is what your looking for you may be disappointed. The strength of this film is the psychological attacks that Cusak endures and the decision he makes at the end based on the type of life he has lead and changes he would have made.

2906058,3,B000TJ6PBU,"1408(released in June/07) stars John Cusack & Samuel Jackson in this film based on a Stephen King short story released in /99. The film works well until shortly after we enter room 1408,then it starts to regress into a cliche ridden,been there done that,spook story.
Author Mike Enslin(Cusack)is a moderately successful writer who has written a few books on ghosts and apparitions. He visits hotels,motels and houses that are supposedly haunted,well equipped with the latest in technology so he can document everything he experiences. However Mike is so far a skeptic,as he has never experienced anything approaching the paranormal in his travels. He returns to his home in California and goes surfing,only to experience a rather violent wave wash-over while trying to read a banner being pulled by a plane. Returning home he is sorting through his  mail when a postcard with the Dolphin Hotel in NYC,catches his eye. The writing on the back says NOT to visit room 1408 there. Intrigued he phones and tries to book it but has no success. He phones his publisher who in turn brings in a lawyer and between the three of them,they manage to get the room booked.
He arrives at the Dolphin a few days later and is greeted by the hotel manager Mr. Olin(Jackson),who begs him not to stay in the room because it is evil. Mike will not be talked out of it and the manager personally escorts him up the elevator to the floor,but will not see him down the hall to the room itself. Mike enters the room to find a rather well appointed older style decor. Always with his personal tape recorder in hand,he talks his notes out,describing the surroundings as mundane and frustratingly waiting to put in another fruitless night. Slowly but surely things start to happen in increments,like chocolates appearing on his pillow,the toilet paper end arranged neatly and a painting going crooked. Suddenly the clock radio comes to life blaring out the Carpenters ""We've only just Begun"".When the room temperature rises to unbearable degrees,he calls a maintenance man who comes but won't step inside the door. After he hurriedly leaves and the door is shut the radio comes on again;he pulls it out but the time revs forward and stops at 60 minutes,only to start clocking slowly backwards. The game is on baby.
Numerous specters of guests past,walk through the room,he tries to leave by walking out on the ledge to the next room but the next room disappears into never ending brick,he sees and talks to his dead daughter and father. We slowly find out that Mike carries alot of emotional baggage with the disintegration of his marriage because of his daughters death with cancer. Mike then desperately uses his laptop to contact his wife for help. This is cut short when the sprinklers go off. He tries to get out through the vent shafts above only to be chased back by an undead figure. A painting of a ship foundering in a storm comes to life and it floods the room with water. He goes under and resurfaces only to find himself back on that same beach in California that he was at when he was washed-over previously. He now can read the plane banner and the phone number on it ends with 1408. He ends up in the hospital with his wife by his side as he tries to make sense of what happened. She tells him to write about his experience,and when he does and is finished, he goes to the local post office to mail the transcript. However the employee who serves him tells him that he can't because they're closed. He recognizes him from the Dolphin Hotel and as he looks around at the construction crew,they are also from the hotel. They start into ripping the walls down to reveal room 1408 of the hotel. He has never left but re-enters it. The room now is blackened out from a fire.
His daughter appears and there is a tearful reunion with her but she suddenly crumbles to dust as the clock radio comes back on and the room returns to normal. Mike grabs a cognac bottle given to him by Olin and makes a Molotov Cocktail out of it and sets the room on fire. The room erupts in screams as the flames engulf the entire room. Firefighters rescue Mike and he is taken to the hospital. Mike has escaped,but barely. As he sits at his desk at home listening to his burnt tape recorder with his wife,the voice of his deceased daughter comes on and both stare at each other in disbelief. Fade to black.
The film builds wonderfully up until the moment the radio blasts out the Carpenter song. From there on in the movie becomes filled with cliches with the walking specters,the hot and cold room,the room filling with water,his disorientation,the taps scalding him,the walls issuing forth blood and so on and so on. The writers here went to great lengths to scare us but in the end,they just end up psyching themselves out by overcompensating with the special effects and muddying the haunted waters,by combining the occult with Mike's closet skeletons. Both main stars do wonderful jobs in their respective roles,with the film eventually turning into a one man show for Cusack;and he certainly was up for the task. It is just too bad the script wasn't.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include shorts on Inside room 1408,an interview with various stars on the film and the trailer.
All in all a decent film of yet another Stephen King story,but expanded to lengths not necessary in order to scare. The film is strong up until shortly after he arrives in room 1408,then it goes downhill in plot and scare factor. It becomes a little too cliched and obvious with the main characters foibles thrown into the mix. But Cusack and Jackson are strong actors and they compensate for the films flaws as best as they can under the circumstances.",1322438400,2,5754,4.663385826771654

2906064,5,B000TJ6PBU,"My roommate brought Room 1408 for us to watch last night, and I have to say I am surprised I never heard of this movie. It is by far one of the best scary movies I have seen in quite some time.

The acting in this movie couldn't be more perfect. John Cusack is exceptional for this role. When I heard that the movie would basically have one setting, room 1408, I was a bit disappointed at first.. I kept thinking how could they make an entire movie with this one ""scary room?"" Boy, was I wrong. This movie has everything a horror movie fanatic would love; it's creepy, it plays on the psychological effect (is he going crazy or is it just the room), its emotional. And just when you think it has ended, and he has finally died, it continues but does not drag on. The movie was so good my palms and feet were sweating (haha).

The only thing that I wish they included was what the room looked like when he finally left. Was everything that happened all in his mind, or did all those horrible things really happen? *SPOILER ALERT* his wife is called and when he tells her to call the police and come to the room she tells them that she did, and there was no body in it. Was that just apart of him going crazy or did that happen? I just can't figure out, especially when at the very end his wife hears him talking to his little girl.. which means everything really did happen to him.

Either way, this was an amazing movie. I highly suggest watching this.",1310342400,3,1452,4.215827338129497

Jackson there to bring Stephen King's book to life.  I liked to be creeped out when watching a good horror/drama movie, and this movie never produced anything that made you eat your popcorn that more quickly.  The bulk of the movie offers mild waves of the ghosts of former tenants of Room 1408 showing up to spook Mr. Cusack, and the occasional visit from his specter of a daughter who died of cancer.  Is the movie a bittersweet drama of Cusack's character coming to terms with his daughter's death, or is it a spookfest trying miserably to produce some scares?  It fails in both accounts.

2906066,5,B000TJ6PBU,"First of all, I am not a huge fan of horror films unless they are frightening and instructive in a sordid manner. I generally like most scary movies, but in last 47 years most horror films have been ""wimpy"" without enough blood, guts, and gore for my personal taste. It seems like most movies these days have too many honest, law-abiding do-gooders who aren't evil, but 1408 is an exception. But the most impressive thing is that the movie has a plot.

1408 starts subtly and then pulls you in quickly, especially when the toilet paper gets mysteriously folded after John Cusack's character uses it. Then two pieces of candy appear on his pillow and the thermostat doesn't work correctly, even though Samuel Jackson had previously warned him. This kind of stuff keeps on building and building until you feel like a 400 pound gorilla is sitting on your chest and you can't breathe. The pacing is just awesome.

Mainly, the acting is wonderful, especially the editor who is played by Tony Shaloub. The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job but are not quite as impressive as Monk.",1303171200,3,1094,4.692708333333333

It turns out there's a whole lot more to be afraid of and you'll find out in Room 1408.  This room has a very odd past with a history of unspeakable and gory tragedies that have occurred over the years.

2906068,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Mr. John Cusack is a chameleon. Not the type who can change their appearances so well, like Uma Thurman and Daniel Day-Lewis. He is an actor who can change is character, demeanor, and presentation with each and every part he plays, and do it to perfection. A lot of other so-called actors should take a few lessons from him, namely Seth Rogan, who plays Seth Rogan in everything he does, and George Clooney, who playes George Clooney in everything he does. The list is virtually endless. John NEVER plays John, and his acting role in 1408 is no exception.

You've seen and heard all about 1408 from countless reviews and allusions over the years since its release, so I won't bore you with the details. What I will bore you with, however, is the poignant fact that if you have yet to see this movie...you MUST check it out. And here's why: IT IS A RARE MOVIE! That's why.

""How?"" you ask.

Well...it isn't often that we get to see a generally creepy horror film. Gore doesn't mean horror, people. Blood and guts is NOT horror. Screaming girls with their mounds of cleavage bouncing from here to Mars while they run from the guy in the mask is NOT horror...not TRUE horror, anyway. Axe- and knife-wielding mad-men do not a horror film make.

Genuine horror can be witnessed by the greats, one of whom I will mention now...Alfred Hitchhock. Horror is suspense. Horror is the ""wondering"" if something is around that next dark corner. Horror is the thrill of FEAR of the unknown. Horror is the anxiety associated with anticipation. Horror is all that adrenalin that runs through your body without an ounce of physical activity put towards its activation. And on this level, 1408 delivers. It is atmospheric, strange, bizarre, and generally rewatchable...just for the sake of there being nothing else out there quite like it. 1408 comes recommended from my family and my friends as well. I have yet to meet a person who didn't find this movie tense and, yet, quite enjoyable.

The Blu-Ray transfer is very good but not perfect. There are times when John is in the darkness of 1408 that colors seem to blend, leaving soft edges and no clear definition of said edges. The black levels are adequate, but sometimes the presentation was tainted with a greenish or yellowish hue, this I believe, was purposeful however. Overall it was a above-average BD transfer.

1408 is a diamond in the rough of the plethora of mediocre to miserable so-called horror films out there. It is dark, creepy, and definitely one to watch if you want your girl to squeeze a little closer to you when the lights are out! :)

One note: The theatrical ending (much preferred) is not included on the Blu-Ray disc for some reason. Instead, it is the Director's Cut, which isn't alluded to anywhere on the cover. Someone dropped the ball in this respect. Maybe some day in the near future, they will release a double disc BD with more extras and the proper treatment as far theatrical endings and director's cuts go.

2906074,1,B000TJ6PBU,"Just finished watching 1408 and I have to add this to the ""Movies Based on a Stephen King Story that Flopped at the End"" pile. The movie stars John Cusack as a paranormal horror author Mike Enslin. He writes books along the lines of ""10 Haunted Hotel Rooms"" and other haunted places. He doesn't believe in ghosts nor does he believe in God because of the death of his daughter. (""How could God allow my daughter to die"" kind of thing)

Enslin receives a postcard warning him not to enter room 1408 of the Dolphin hotel in New York City. The hotel manager, Mr. Olin, played by Samuel L. Jackson gives him a long list of people who have died in that room. One maid was stuck in the bathroom for only a moment and had become blind. When asked about the spirits or ghosts of the room, Mr Olin tells Enslin, ""It's just evil.""

Scary things happen near the beginning of Enslin's stay, I'll give it that. I was on the edge of my seat once he entered the room. He's given an hour to live. Olin warns him, ""No one has survived longer than an hour."" The clock beside the bed ticks off the seconds. Unfortunately, as the clock nears 00:00:00, I went from thinking, ""What in the world is this?!?"" to ""Just finish this trash already"".

1408 had so much promise. It could have been a terrific horror movie if done properly. It could have been done in a way that scared the living daylights out of you, while giving you ideas to think about. Instead the story became lame and the direction was pathetic.

2906079,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Firstly, MINOR SPOILER ALERT AT END OF THIS REVIEW! Ok,I loved this movie, and am surprised that it didn't do better at the box office; I had never even heard of it until I saw it on Amazon. With Stephen King movies, you pay your money and you take a gamble (I remember all these years later, sitting in the theatre and watching CUJO, Hmm, somebody owed a pretty hefty downpayment on the newest house). But 1408 earns its' five star rating, and, having the double disc with both endings included, I have watched both versions a couple of times, and I intend to watch it again, soon. The plot is discussed in the many other reviews listed, and so I am going to pretty much stick to my personal view of the acting, for the most part - obviously, the writing, direction and production can be flawless, but if the acting isn't up to par, it's a complete waste of time, effort and money. John Cusack really surprised me with his portrayal of a burned out, grieving writer, Mike Enslin, who churns out books about hauntings/ghosts/the paranormal not because he has any belief in them (he specializes in debunking such things, but there is an underlying and unspoken suggestion that he may have at one time believed, or hoped to find proof that he could believe), but because it pays the bills. After he receives a mysterious postcard telling him to check out Room 1408 of The Dolphin Hotel in NYC, Mike demands to be allowed to stay in 1408, despite the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) telling him that the room is not available. This is where the movie pretty much turns into a one man showcase for John Cusack, who gets his way, gets into the room, and then can't get out. Watching John change the character of Enslin from a bored, cold-as-ice-what-do-I-do-today-to-keep-from-driving-off-a-bridge individual whose only child has died to a man who realizes that the bizarre events going on inside that room simply have no explanation (trickery, him being drugged and delusional, etc.) is fascinating, and again, I can't figure out why this movie, and John's acting, didn't make more of a critical splash. Whether he's taken aback at the sudden appearance of pillow mints on the bed or watching a ghostly and long ago suicide victim cross the room and climb onto the open window's ledge, Cusack shows just the right amount of shock, then cracks in the shell, then near hysteria and back to the sudden, sickening recognition that he might not being getting out of there alive. The other actors and actresses in the film are pretty much relegated to glorified extras, all there to advance the plotline, but that acting as well is good, and Samuel L. Jackson, as the manager Gerald Olin, could have delivered his few scenes in too heavy a hand, and it would have come off more camp than frightening...instead, he hits the mark perfectly, and the viewer realizes that Olin is just as afraid of 1408 as he tells everybody else to be. I really, really enjoyed this film, although I strongly disliked the version with the alternate ending: whether it is because you end up liking Mike Enslin, and pulling for him to make it out and not only write a great book but see Life through renewed eyes (there's a few seconds' scene at the beginning of the movie where, when sorting through the mail that holds the 1408 postcard in the first place, Enslin receives a birthday card - Cusack does a wonderful little weary, ""So what?"" glance at the card and flips it away, saying more right there about what this character feels since his child died than had he spoken three pages of dialogue), I just didn't really want the film to end (SPOILER!) with the hotel room winning. If you want to see Mike not go down as yet another victim to that 'evil f@#!@#@ room', as Gerald Olin puts it, watch the version that was widely circulated. If you want to see how Room 1408 adds another notch to its doorpost, the director's cut is for you. And if you want to be just a little more cautious when traveling from now on, when you check into your next motel/hotel room, do some quick arithmitic of the room number. If it adds up to '13', well....",1286150400,2,4113,4.5896739130434785

2906083,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Imagine being in a creepy room that you can't escape from and it's scaring you because it's touching deep psychological nerves of fear.  Then you wake up and you think that it was a dream, but then you find out that you're waking up really was the dream and you are still in the room. And it goes on and on .... This is one of the most psychologically disturbing parts of this film ... the idea of being trapped in a nightmare unable to escape an unbearable situation.  (Remember the TV series from the '60s, The Prisoner?  Touched a similar nerve, but much less so.)

Then you start seeing your Daughter, who died of cancer, and she's telling you ""Daddy, I'm scared, I'm cold ...... ""  indicating of course that your little daughter is facing the cold, lonely, malevolent ""afterworld"" without the comfort of you, her Mother, any Angels or benevolent deities.  Once again, it deeply touches the ""disturbing"" nerve.  And you can see your wife over a screen but she has no idea where you are or that you're in danger.  And it just gets more & more unbearable until you are tempted to end it all.

OK, that's the basic idea of this movie.  Lots of psychological horror in lieu of outright violence and gore.  I think that it deserves an R rating because of that (as well as Hollywood starting to drop F-bombs in supposed PG-13 movies -- if they're going to do that, they should accept an R rating).

I had the same opinion of the Ring.  IF you follow along with it, then you get to a point where you are despairing and feeling lost, with the Nihilistic message.  But at least there is redemption in the end in ""1408"" (in the version that we watched!  I hear there's another ending out there that's much more depressing.)  Some hard-core horror fans may not find the movie compelling, but I did, because I generally do not watch the hard-core stuff and so I'm not so calloused yet.

Actually the ""room"" is a metaphor for life's seemingly inescapable traps, such as massive depression or drug addiction.  That the main character gets out of it in the end, could be inspiration to someone going through a real-life ""Room 1408.""

I liked the acting job of John Cusack, who carried most of the movie as the originally cynical ghost hunter who gets trapped in the room/nightmare and tries to get out.  Also, Samuel Jackson makes the most of his supporting role, as a forceful & charismatic Hotel Manager.  You never know if he's on Cusack's side, or he's part of the conspiracy to trap people in that bleeping room!

BTW I give this movie 3.5 stars but since Amazon doesn't have half-points, I'd rather round it up to a ""4"" than down to a ""3.""",1280966400,,2634,4.477987421383648

Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a writer of guides to haunted places who has lost his faith in just about everything since the death of his daughter. He goes through life debunking ghost stories until he receives a strange invitation concerning room 1408 of New York's Dolphin Hotel. Determined to get his story he begins research on the room which has claimed over 50 lives. After arriving in New York he meets with hotel manager Gerard Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) who warns Enslin not to go into the room. Not heeding his advive Enslin enters the room for the night and strange things begin happening.

The two disc version of the film contains two versions of the film: the original theatrical version and the extended director perferred cut which completely changes the ending);a somewhat slow moving commentary by Hafstrom and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; two very short webisodes; deleted scenes with optional commentary and the standard making of featurette.

While this may not be the best King adaptation around it does make for a better than average horror film dealing with topics not usually found in the genre including the loss of beliefs and isolation.

2906088,1,B000TJ6PBU,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of this movie. If you watched it in theaters and liked that ending, you will be gravely disappointed. For this version, they decided it would be a good idea to cut the original ending and use the ""director's cut"" ending, which replaces the psychologically intriguing note it ends on with cheap shocks. Even George Lucas could not have better ruined a great film. I rented this on blockbuster and am very happy I did so. I will be taking good care of my DVD copy in its case with the real ending until they re-release this film as it should have been kept.

The original ending was not even in the extras on this Blu-Ray. Better would have been for them to include both versions (Theatrical and Director's) and let you choose since it's you're money you're paying to see it.

2906089,5,B000TJ6PBU,"NOTE: This review contains MAJOR SPOILERS

A specific hotel room in the Dolphin Hotel, New York, has become a breeding ground for disaster. In Room 1408, people have killed either themselves or other people through the ages, for no apparent reason whatsoever. The staff has since abandoned not only the room, but the entire floor as well (the thirteenth). Nobody is allowed on the thirteenth floor unless someone is supposed to be, such as maids or janitors. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a skeptic writer who specializes on paranormal activities, and he wants to know if 1408 really is a hellhole or if the murders are powered by false superstition. The manager of the hotel (Jackson) warns him about the dangers of staying in Room 1408 for about one hour, but Enslin doesn't budge. As soon as he finds himself in Room 1408, bad things happen, of course. And this is when his own beliefs on the paranormal are drastically challenged.

This is one of the more effective (and intelligent) horror films that I've recently seen. When other horror films rely on blood, gore, and whiny teenage girls, ""1408"" relies more on atmosphere and psychological effects. There are a few jump scares here and there, but they're actually done pretty well. This also has a more mature tone: this is the kind of horror film that is suited more for adults than for teenagers and kids. I'm sure several teenagers enjoy this, too, but I do think that this movie is primarily for adults. The one problem I had with the movie was when Enslin is convinced that his stay at the hotel was only a dream. This scene is situated very late in the film, right before he realizes that he is still in the hotel, and it's somewhat annoying, considering that the ""dream sequence"" is an old and tired gimmick that we've seen many times before. I know that we as the viewer are supposed to believe that it's not a dream at all, but it's done far too well as it looks and feels a bit too predictable. This is my only gripe, however, as everything else in the movie works.

Now, I want to talk about the ending to this movie. The alternate ending (the one that's on the DVD) has been fairly criticized for its more depressing outcome. I think the criticisms are unjust, because I feel that this ending is far superior to the original theatrical ending. I have seen both endings, and, in my opinion, the alternate is more effective compared to the theatrical. I don't want it to be conventional. I don't like it when these particular horror films have a typical happy ending, where all the problems are solved with a feel-good attitude. With this alternate ending, it challenges you by going against your emotions and making you think of the consequences that you have just seen on the screen. Also, to me, this ending fits more to the entire movie. Enslin sacrificing himself to prevent his estranged wife from being 1408's next victim shows that he really changed. In the past, he has made some selfish decisions before his daughter's death. Even though he does lose his life in the end, he realizes that he has one last chance to redeem himself, and he accepts it despite a few consequences.

Overall, this is one of the better horror films to have come out in the year 2007, and I even think that it surpasses some other horror films in the present. Keep in mind, this is not as excellent as The Exorcist or The Shining, but it's pretty close.

2906099,5,B000TJ6PBU,"The PG-13 rating given to 1408 belies this film's truly terrifying effects on its audience. Though it's far less gory than its peers, it has frightening moments and a creepy mood throughout. John Cusack (IDENTITY) plays Mike Enslin, a gifted writer who has turned his talents to paranormal travel books. His stays in haunted hotels never shake him, but he's intrigued by New York's Dolphin Hotel. Room 1408 has been the site of dozens of deaths, and this is a selling point for the skeptic in Mike. Despite the warnings of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson, BLACK SNAKE MOAN), Mike resolves to stay in the haunted room. No one has lasted more than an hour in 1408, and Mike has his work cut out for him. Though Cusack got his acting pedigree in comedies, he proves he's able to adeptly carry a horror film. He's in practically every frame of the film, often alone, and he's great at making the audience share in his fear. This is the second English-language film from director Mikael Hafstrom (DERAILED), and he does a good job of establishing tension. A lot of the credit is due to the film's sound crew, whose detailed work goes far in giving 1408 its unsettling feeling. Like THE SHINING, this is based on writing from horror master Stephen King, and it's a similarly creepy tale set in a hotel. But in its execution, 1408 is far more indebted to classic horror films such as the original 1963 version of THE HAUNTING. I was most skeptical but I found that I really enjoyed this film. You have to give it a chance and you will be surprised, I did and I was .",1268006400,,1564,4.491228070175438

2906101,1,B000TJ6PBU,"I've just finished watching the director's cut of 1408 and I have to say, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. ""Stephen King"" and ""Best movie adaption since The Shining"" (ha!) on the cover made me buy. I'm not at all a horror fan, but I loved The Shining, and John Cusack & Samuel L. Jackson as well. I feel sorry for both actors for having to have lent their names for this embarrasing movie for all eternity (they won't be able to erase it from [...] etc.).

Do you remember that feeling you got at the end of Mulholland Drive? That notion of ""this doesn't make sense""? I first got that feeling a couple of minutes after Cusack closed the room door (about 15 mins or so into the movie). The film starts off interesting (I caught myself staring at the TV all the way from the bathroom fearing I'd miss something). The special effects are great. They sent a couple of cold jolts down my spine and are good for a few scares. I think the reason why I didn't press the 'Stop' button is because I was hoping that, in the end, this would make sense (like some Hakan Nesser Mystery). The longer the film lasted however, the more I was thinking 'What it this?'. The only thing this film has in common with ""The Shining"", is that the setting of both is for the most part in (a) hotel(s). At least it got my girlfriend and I talking (ranting & complaining) about the movie way past the credits. Obviously, this film lives from the psychedelic and eerie atmosphere that it tries to convey, with flashbacks, dreams (or reality? eeew..), illusions, blood and all that. Maybe I should have watched the Theatre version..at least that was in theatres. I can't imagine why else they would release a DVD like this upon mankind.

I'm not going to talk you out of buying this. Buy it. Watch it. Make your own opinion. I was surprised to see that this film got more than one star with almost 200 reviews. Suppose therefore I might be wrong in saying what I am. Nonetheless though, this is, in my opinion, truly the worst film of all time. At least Plan 9 from Outer Space was funny - and a masterpiece in comparison.",1267488000,2,2119,4.348484848484849

2906107,3,B000TJ6PBU,"It's quick to draw you in, and it does fairly get under your skin in a kind of frustrating way, although it's not a seamless movie and you can feel the hand of the movie makers in it too much. Samuel Jackson wasn't convincing as the hotel manager in spite of his two words of French, and he gets more billing than he deserves as he must occupy about 15 minutes worth of movie time.  Cusack wasn't bad.  The chill factor is akin to the kind of drug paranoia associated with people who went off the deep end with LSD or some other such substance and never 'made it back' (Syd Barret?).  Sixties child S. King's work has often been influenced by the psychedelic potential, which offers interesting possibilities for his novels and more so when left to the imagination rather than the screen.  There are some decent visual moments in the film, but there are just as many others that simply feel like gaudy Hollywood manipulation.  The premise of stepping into this room is that you are stepping into another dimension simutaneously - a dimension which doesn't follow the laws of logic or time, is bent on tormenting those who enter, and from which there is no escape, as it is hardly of this world in the first place.  Charming, eh?

The film doesn't really compare with Kubrick's Shining.  Yes, they were both Stephan King, yes they both take place in hotels.  But where The Shining is a masterful work of art on all levels (story, acting, cinematography), 1408 is a kind of fast food by comparison, with a quick story, so-so character acting and more special effects than dynamite film work.  It does leave a mark though as do so many of King's stories, tapping into a kind of primal paranoia.  I give this film 3.5 stars, and maybe it deserved 4, but not 5.  I'm going to watch the alternate ending on the second dvd now, which supposedly does away with the ""happy ending"" of the theater version on disc one.",1260835200,,1907,4.511627906976744

2906110,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I can't say I'm as thrilled with 1408 as most people.

The movie did an INCREDIBLE job in the beginning building up suspense that the hotel room the main character wanted to stay in was full of unexplainable evil, and had a dangerous history of countless deaths over the years of the previous visitors that stayed in the room.  After all the convincing that the guy should NOT stay in the room from Samuel L. Jackson's character, I was anticipating what kind of danger this room would hold.

The creepy build up as the guy (who was a book writer by the way) was approaching the room while walking down the hotel hallway was quite good too, with an elevator opening by itself, and flies buzzing over the food on the plates that were sitting on a tray outside a hotel room.  You could sense an enormous danger right around the corner.

Once the guy entered the room and started experiencing how insane the room really was, this is where the movie started to lose me... but only a little bit.

A nice twist having the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun"" constantly playing on the alarm clock radio, haha.  I love that song.  The history of the band itself was a tragedy, though I don't think the movie directors intended the band to be the focus of the storyline- it was just a random song they chose that was appropriate for the film because of the song title and the beautiful melody of the vocals worked REALLY work in this kind of uncomfortable setting.

Anyway, once the guy started getting comfortable inside the room (or rather, UNcomfortable) strange things began to happen.

Of course this is a horror movie, so the suspense started off slow and builded gradually.  Once the guy realized something was terribly wrong (and arrogantly thought beforehand that NOTHING would happen to him) he started having hallucinations.  It was a REAL challenge trying to figure out what was real and what was just the guys hallucinations creeping in.  Of course the evil in the room was forcing the guy to have hallucinations quite often about his dead daughter and almost drowning in a ocean (and waking up near a beach) but it was REALLY confusing to me what was really happening and what wasn't.

I also feel the movie went a little too far with the creepiness and the hallucinations of the room.  Come on, the ENTIRE room turns into a freezer suddenly as the guy almost freezes to death?  The ENTIRE room floods with water as he almost drowns?  It went WAY too far sometimes and the creepiness went away as a result.

1408 is quite entertaining as far as the action is concerned- one great scene right after another, and the film certainly LOOKS really good.

Well, the film does make more sense in its conclusion.  I might give this movie a higher rating the second time I watch it, but as it is, it could have been a classic had some exaggerated scenes never taken place.",1250380800,,2866,4.560546875
2906111,3,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is an interesting concept, a room so soaked with death and tragedy that it has become its own supernatural realm, presence, what-have-you.  Unfortunately, for me, it falls flat in the execution therein.

John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, an author whose books are about demystifying places of supernatural mystery.  Throughout the story, this motivation is explored, and lends the movie great purpose.  Don't imagine a lot of screen time from others, it is primarily Cusack on the screen with the rest of the cast practically amounting to cameo appearances.

In this quest to demystify, he learns of ""Room 1408"" at a prestigious hotel.  While in the room he comes face-to-face with the supernatural world and battles it constantly, trying to survive until a time-limit is reached (apparently no previous guests have lasted beyond a specific time interval, and while the movie implies that the ordeal will be over at this time, there is nothing shown or told that would make this any more than wishful thinking on Enslin's part.)

Unfortunately, the movie seems to be full of half-scares, half-creeps and half-finished ideas.  There are plenty of freaky circumstances, lots of menacing ghoulies, but it never seems to reach a critical point.  The movie can't seem to decide if it wants to be Japanese Horror (lonely horror, atmospheric, slow build with disturbing and discordant glimpses of dreadful things to come) or Western Horror (Terror and Gore thrown up to 11 to shock and scare the viewer) and as such the supernatural force comes across as (charitably put) unfocused.  Does the force want to terrify Enslin?  Does it want to kill him?  Is there another motivation at work?  This is all eventually explained, as a matter of fact, to offer a conclusion which, like the horror, is half-hearted in the end.

There are a few startling moments, nothing horrendous (certainly not as creepy / scary as Poltergeist, a movie 25 years its senior and superior in nearly every way.) and nothing ground-breaking.  In all, it's worth a rental if you are looking for some time to fill with an OK film, but if you're looking for horror, there's much better and bigger game out there.",1247875200,2,2176,4.9559228650137745

The Blu-Ray does contain 2 ""alternate endings"" that you can view in the special features sections.  Problem is neither are the original Theatrical Ending.  To be specific, (Caution, some Spoiler info follows):

Alternate ending #1 shows Mike's publisher receiving a manuscript he wrote while presumably still trapped in the room.
Alternate ending #2 is very close to the theatrical but with one key difference.

In the Theatrical movie ending we see Mike with his wife in their New York apartment.  He starts to play a mini-cassette audio tape he made while trapped in the hotel room.  As the tape progresses he hears something supernatural and more importantly his wife also hears it also as a look of belief lights her face as we fade to credits.

In the Blu-Ray Alternate ending #2, Mike hears the cassette but this time his wife *never hears or even pays attention to it*.  She just continues to wonder about the apartment tidying up things.  Yes, it's a slight difference but profound from a storytelling standpoint.

So, if  you want the original theatrical, buy (or keep) your DVD.  The Blu-Ray is still worth it for the dazzling high resolution transfer and other extra footage.

This movie is surprising, which is rare in these days of horror movie cliches. I could not guess what was going to happen next.

The odd thing is, it seems to follow the haunted house script done so many times before, yet 1408 somehow manages to be fresh and new in the genre. 1408 has something for every phobia imaginable.  Mine is fear of heights, so the hotel ledge scene really got my adrenaline up.

One of the best scenes in the movie is what Michael finds up in the heating duct as he tries to escape Room 1408. The movie allows you to see it somewhat, yet doesn't focus too closely so that the details of the ""thing in the heating duct"" still remains in your imagination.

Taken as a whole, this movie finds your deap seated fear, and no matter what that may be, this movie will force you to live it.

Honestly, I cannot imagine why anyone would give this movie less than 5 stars. I have seen a lot of bad horror movies in my day, and this one is one of the few good ones.  1408 is a very fast-paced, exciting, and SCARY film. I recommend 1408 and I am as picky as they come.

Normally I prefer to know why something is the way it is, but in this case, not knowing what makes the room evil is one of the best parts. And the way it tortures John Cusack is inspired!

2906126,2,B000TJ6PBU,"Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a `true story' horror writer in the fact that he writes about haunted houses or places he visits. Never has he actually come across a ghost or even anything remotely haunting and it shows in his cynicism when people ask him questions or when people tell him about something that is haunted. One day while going through all the `come to my haunted place' mail he gets, he comes across a simple post card saying `Do Not Enter 1408', and it grabs his attention and he decides to try out the room. After some legal action, he finally gets his room booked and heads to the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel Jackson), tries his best to convince Mike to not go into the room and to just take a penthouse suite and go to a Knicks game... anything but go in there. After some very convincing arguments from Gerald, Mike still goes in the room. Once in the room, Mike begins to witness some strange and scary events from a room that isn't just haunted, but more like evil and demonic. Mike is convinced he's just drugged from liquor that Gerald gave him and is hallucinating everything until things begin to hurt him.

I really didn't care for this movie for the fact that, due to the trailers, I thought I was going to be watching a scary haunted room movie. But in fact it was more of a scary psychological thriller movie. That doesn't really bother me, but most of the scenes were just plain or not that interesting. There were a couple scenes that were really good, but there were just too many that made me wish the movie was over. I for one could have done without the daughter scenes, but that's only because I didn't know I was going into a `thinker' movie. Sure, I get the point that the room was bringing out his inner demons or whatever, but at the time, it was just out of place for me. And then the whole `is he in the room or is this in his head' and `did he escape or did he not' stuff was just not well thought out. If you wanted to leave it open for us for thinking, I don't think the ending should have been what it was. I heard there were two different ending though and I saw the one that was on the single disc DVD.

I'll tell you what though; Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor. While he was trying to convince Mike to not go in that room, I was thinking, ""DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM. LISTEN TO SAM! HE GOT ATE BY A SHARK! HE KNOWS THINGS!"" The dialogue between John and Sam was really done well by both actors. I shouldn't really have to say much about John Cusack, he's awesome in everything he does. It's just his style that I really like. Like when Sam was hovering over John in a chair while telling a story, you see John look up and say ""What are you doing?"" It just felt like it wasn't scripted to me and I started giggling a little.

Well in the end, I would say give it a try. These movies are seriously hit or miss for all different types of people. But to this guy, I really hated it both times I saw it.

2906130,3,B000TJ6PBU,"I remember seeing the trailor for 1408 in theaters, and absolutly couldn't wait to see it! John Cusack played an amazing role in this movie! Very good acting through-out each scene.. very funny attitude during the beginning of the movie.

My only issue with this movie, was the dead giveaway during the elevator scene with Samuel Jackson. The lines that were spoken in the managers office seemed like a very convincing story, until I heard what I heard in the elevator.

I'm not one to guess what happens next in every movie I watch.. I LOVE being suprised! But mannnn-- I was disappointed when Jackson talked about the way him and the maids treat room 1408. The first thing that hit me was ""I wounder if.."", which with each following scene made that WHAT IF piece together much sooner that I wanted it to.

Sooo.. if it weren't for the dead giveaway, this movie was an incredible story, with some of the best acting from Cusack I've seen in a looong time! Definatly a muct see... if I haven't already spoiled it for you yet. My apoligizes!",1232755200,,1040,4.550802139037433
2906131,3,B000TJ6PBU,"Hey there, Blu-ray fans! Ok, the Blu-ray of 1408 doesn't have many reviews so I'll come on and inform you of the product as I have this baby in my collection.

First off... the controversy. This disc has the director's cut ending as part of the film and no you can't change it to the theatrical cut. The theatrical ending is included as an additional scene but you can't incorporate it into the movie itself. There is also a third ending that you can view as an additional scene too.

So to make it absolutely clear, if you are buying this Blu-ray you are buying the director's cut of the film, which equates to just a little extension of a couple of scenes, nothing major there but the big qualm is the director's cut ending which is completely different from what you watched in the movie theater, ( if you indeed saw it in the theater that is ).

I did see the film in the theater and I will describe the different endings in detail so turn away if you haven't seen the film and jump forward a few paragraphs to where I have written ""end of spoilers"".

SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS!

The original theatrical ending had John Cusack's character surviving the hotel fire and reuniting with his wife. He still can't comprehend his experience but he is moving on. One day while looking through his old possessions he finds his tape recorder that he had with him in the hotel room, listens to it and hears the voice of the spirit of his dead daughter. This confirms that there is more beyond death and this supposedly gives the Cusack character some piece of mind.

This ending is restrained, not a typical happy ending, even though the main character lives. I enjoyed it very much as I saw it in the movie theater and was shocked to discover when I rented the original DVD, that the director's cut contained a totally new ending. And here is that ending...

Cusack dies in the hotel fire, there is a funeral, his wife, now a widow is there, so is his editor played by Tony Shalhoub. Sam Jackson stops by to deliver some of Cusack's belongings to the widow. She does not want them so Jackson goes to his car, plays the burned tape recorder and hears the ghostly voice of Cusack's daughter. Alarmed by this, Jackson gets the scare of his life as he sees the burnt up zombie corpse of Cusack in the rear-view mirror staring at him! A cheap and ridiculous scare typical of horror flicks! Then Jackson turns around to find no one there. The locale changes and we are back to the burnt down, closed hotel where Cusack died. We see his ghost near the window looking out, he hears the call of his dead daughter's voice and goes out of our view. Ostensibly he is now a ghost forever trapped with his daughter's ghost or a representation of it in the burnt down hotel. Whatever.

This ending was cheap and lame but the director probably thought killing the main character would be more edgy! Nonsense. The theatrical cut was just fine, far more refined and subtle.

The third ending involves the editor played by Tony Shalhoub. His role in the film was a glorified cameo so this extra scene is ok to watch once. He receives the new manuscript from the dead Cusack character. Reading it he is freaked out by how bizarre it is. End of film.

END OF SPOILERS

Clearly the original theatrical conclusion is the best of the three possibilities but the director or the studio or both have arrogantly conspired to shove this down people's throats or perhaps use it as an excuse to double dip this Blu-ray in the future. This is still a highly watchable, entertaining film and this blemish doesn't spoil what is actually one of the best Stephen King adaptations in many years. The first two-thirds of the film are especially riveting, the build-up to entering the hotel room, the long narrative arc of staying in this hellish environment... Cusack is terrific here, playing for almost an hour practically by himself. Outstanding build up of tension. The film loses momentum and goes off the rails in the last third and then we get this annoying director's cut ending. The point of the whole film is that this angry, lonely man just wants a tiny confirmation of the supernatural so that he can have piece of mind over his daughter's death. If he can find evidence of a supernatural realm, there may indeed be a God and a point and purpose to life after all and that his daughter's death was not in vain. Of course he gets more than he bargained for! The original theatrical ending really worked in the context of the themes I have summarized. The director's cut version is more nihilistic and ridiculous. Overall still worth it if you're not attached to the theatrical ending and since I bought this Blu-ray I guess I'm not.

The picture quality is mostly very good with high contrast in the daylight scenes which look appropriately gorgeous here on Blu-ray. The more dimly lit interiors are also a joy to behold and the great cinematography gives this Blu-ray a lot to work with. A famous Blu-ray reviewing website reported that this transfer has pumped, oversaturated colors. I only found that in a few instances with some of the textures having a plasticky appearance but overall I had no major disappointments with this transfer.

The audio has a True HD 5.1 track which is great as well a standard 5.1 Dolby track that is also very fine.

The extras contain a very informative audio commentary by the director and the co-screenwriters. Then there are the typical featurettes, some promotional fluff, deleted scenes and the aforementioned alternate endings. All in all, this Blu-ray is a solid purchase if you are not too attached to the theatrical ending. And if you've never seen this film, then you may not care at all and enjoy the director's preferred conclusion! So then, that's it. Adios for now, Blu-ray aficionados!",1232409600,7,5807,4.603481624758221
2906132,2,B000TJ6PBU,"1480 starts out with an interesting enough premise.  Semi-famous true haunting writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) who doesn't really believe in hauntings finally stays in the wrong haunted room.  But the twist is that the room isn't haunted in the traditional sense.  The room itself is some sort of malevolent being that loves to torture, drive mad and eventually kill its residents.

Interesting enough - and we get to see Mike first in a non-haunted setting and see his method of taking notes into a recorder as he researches each location.  Then one mysterious post card invitation later and we get to some truly creepy dialog by a very determined hotel manager played by Sam Jackson who tries his best to discourage our writer from staying in 1408.  The acting here shines and really draws the viewer in and makes them ready for a truly scary ride.  Mr. Jackson's performance is subtle but his descriptions of what the room has done to its various residents are chilling and his sincere desire to keep Mike from staying in that room had me thinking anyone would be a fool to stay there after this conversation.  But then we wouldn't have a movie.

BEWARE SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD

The stay in the room starts off strongly enough with a slow build as the radio blares and the clock becomes a count down timer and maybe there's someone in the room (!).  We meet a very smart repair man who refuses to come into the room but rather talks Mike through how to fix his thermostat then beats it out of there.  Closing the door (maybe for the last time) he slowly comes to realize he is trapped in 1408 and it's out to get him.  But alas this is where a derailment occurs.

The room starts a campaign to drive Mike mad.  It works very suddenly as he almost immediately claims he's hallucinating and that the manager must have drugged his booze.  Much dialog becomes almost incoherent ramblings into his tape player.  The room plays increasingly random seeming and inane tricks that almost become funny instead of scary.  Ha! Smashed your hand!  Ha! Burned you with the water! Ha! You are here... the only room in existence, no escape!  Ha! Here's some random clown looking guy slashing at you!  Ha! It's hot!  Now it's freezing!  The only really impactful thing it does is make him relive scenes of his young daughter dying which really is mean.

Then 1408 becomes omnipotent and bends time and space and in an easily predictable move sends Mike out to a point where he'd almost drowned earlier in the movie (seriously didn't you think it odd to have this almost drowned scene back then and nothing made of it?).  Then in a double clich, after thinking he has been out of the room a few days he's really not (predictable again) but has a toothpick to prove he was out.  The room also brings his daughter back to him so that he can experience her death again (some of the first emotion I'd felt in a bit of movie time)which again is just really mean.

And this aside from the randomness that the movie delves into after a point is one of the main things that pulled me out of the movie.  The room has proven to be almost all powerful, changing physics, inducing visions, replaying the past, conversing via hotel phone, filling itself with snow and water, sending false video messaging images of Mike to his estranged wife, bending space time and bringing the dead back to life and it can't stop Mike from setting it on fire?  You can argue that it was all in Mike's head maybe but the movie disproves that notion right at the end (theatrical cut).

It was a strong start and interesting premise but just lost all menace along the way.",1232064000,2,3625,4.532307692307692

2906134,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Update-

Never get tired of this one. Can watch it over and over and still love it everytime....Still very happy they went with the so called ""happy ending"". The alternate ending was OK, but drastically changes the entire tone of the movie.....I thought I would hate this movie but what a surprise......The more times I watch it the better it keeps getting and that is the sign of an excellent movie..when it never gets old watching it many times.....

I will leave my original review below untouched and give an update pertaining to my question about the alternate ending in my below review.

My feeling has not changed. EXCELLENT movie. I did get to view the 2nd disc and can say the following....considering you can pick up the 2 disc for almost nothing at your local used dvd/cd/gaming store I would go ahead and get the 2 disc version.

However, thank g-d they put out the theatrical version instead of the alternate ending extended cut. I never thought 5 - 8 minutes could make so much differance to the entire impact of the whole movie. It lost ALOT with the extended cut...100% different tone/scope...leaves you with a very ""unsatisfied"" feeling...the original was awesome in my opinion.....the extended cut was good in that it got more screen time for Samuel Jackson but it turned the movie in to a 5 star, watch over and over, type movie ( I have it on my dvr and watch it frequently..never gets old....) in to a 2 star watch once with no desire to watch again, type feeling....If you can get the extended cut 2 disk version on the cheap, I say go for it as it is worth checking out..if not..dont worry....the original version is SO MUCH better!! But I won't spoil either by giving away what happened ;>)

This got alot of negative reviews so I was expecting to put the disc in and stop watching within 1/2 hour or so. Nope, I was quite surprised at how great this movie was. John Cusak was simply excellent in this film....possibly his best on screen performance ever. Was never a real big fan of his....Thought he was OK...liked most of his movies but never really thought of him as a ""great actor""....This changed my opinion...very few could have given such a great performance as he did....Wont go over the plot since so many already have...but it was simply a great movie..one that started out with a boring 3 or 4 minutes followed by the movie getting better and better every minute that went by until the fantastic ending occured. Regarding the ending..As I said, I thought it was GREAT...caught me surprise...pretty much thought the movie was over and then the ending that blew my mind.....I saw the original version (as some call it...""the happy ending"")..Not so sure it was ""happy"".....but it was EXCELLENT!! Now, can anybody tell me what happens in the alternate ending that some say was better and others say was worse? Thanks to any that respond....Very curious to know how the alternate ending version went.......This movie may not be for everybody but if you like this ""type"" of movie, I think you will like it....Cant speak for the alternaten ending....If anybody can post what happens in the Alternate ending it would be much appreciated....",1231545600,,3168,4.7111913357400725
2906135,4,B000TJ6PBU,"OK now a lot of people who give this movie a bad review seem to be forgetting a few things. First off, I wouldn't really call this a horror movie. It's more of a mystery/ghost-story.

***SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER BUT NOT REALLY***

John Cusack dominates the entire movie with stone-faced brilliance in a way only he can. But the thing that makes this movie so awesome is that you never really know if he's imagining what's happening to him or if it's real. The movie really keeps you guessing until the very end and even then it's kind of left somewhat up in the air.  It is apparent as the movie gets going that Cusack's character has his own inner demons he needs to face down, and it's growingly ambiguous whether or not the ""ghosts"" he faces in that room are his own, or the room's.  It's all very psychologically driven, so hardcore horror fans who love the fast-paced gorefest will probably be bored by this movie.

Also, I notice a lot of people who negatively review the movie claim that the scares in it are cheap and run-of-the-mill. For me personally, I think Stephen King worked it this way on purpose. I mean he's Stephen King for crying out loud; he's the horror genius. You don't think he can think of better or more original scares than to make the walls drip blood? Cusack's character is a jaded not-easily-scared writer, so all these cheap B-movie horror-flick type scare shots are just there to test his belief system. Because when King wants to scare you, or at least make you feel eerie, he accomplishes it.

I took off one star because I thought they could've done better if they'd made the film an R-rating. Not to mention, and again this is a kind of a spoiler, that Samuel L. Jackson's role is totally ambiguous, even the room itself is totally ambiguous. So it's his inner demons then? Then why'd the room kill all those other people? The end is totally unclear, for my dumb brain at least. So that's why I took off a star.

***REAL UNAMBIGUOUS SPOILER AHEAD***

All in all, what few reviewers seem to mention or notice is that this is much more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It has that same psychological element that the Saw movies do, for me at least, in that they force the character(s) to brave something terrible to realize how much they want to live. Cusack's character was like the walking dead before he met that room. That room forced him to face his demons and realize that he wants to live, REALLY live. And believe.

Maybe it's a bit corny but it's how I interpreted the movie.",1231113600,,2532,4.48695652173913
2906136,2,B000TJ6PBU,"Sorry, but anyone who places this film on par with The Shining is just plain uninformed. The only thing even slightly redeeming in 1408 is Cusack's performance, which is strained, I believe, to make-up for the utterly uninspired directing and flat screen write.

2906138,4,B000TJ6PBU,"The story is pretty simple. A man stays in a cursed room in a New York Hotel. The Dolphin Hotel's ""Room 1408"" is actually ""an evil room,"" the hotel manager says, where more than 50 guests have committed suicide there (one drowned in his chicken soup). Ignoring the warning words of the manager, a jaded writer Mike Enslin checks in the room where he encounters a series of creepy events. Mike, who doesn't believe in these paranormal events, must endure the terrifying 60 minutes there.

Had it not been for John Cusack who plays the skeptic protagonist Mike, ""1408"" could have been an unwatchable mess. John Cusack and his strong acting successfully provide tension and occasional humor to the familiar story while the superb production designs and the photography of the dimly-lit interiors give the film an authentic feel. Samuel L. Jackson appears as the hotel manager Gerald Olin, but his role is just an extended cameo and the film is virtually about Cusack's hero and the room itself.

However, in spite of its gripping first half, the film gradually loses steam, not knowing where to go. Whatever the room does, the room does anyway, and there are not many options it can eventually take. The Carpenters song is a nice touch, but director Mikael Hfstrm takes too much time to lead us to the climax, and some of the tricks you will see are nothing new and sometimes look repetitious.

""1408,"" based on a Stephen King short, has familiar elements seen in numerous haunted house stories (in book or film) of the past, most notably, ""The Shining"" - both stories centering on isolated space, for example - but their approach is different. I enjoyed watching ""1408"" for the most part, but it is also true that I couldn't shake off the feeling that I saw it all elsewhere.",1227398400,,1773,4.731391585760518
2906139,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I'd put off seeing 1408 for a while, namely based on the fact that PG-13 rated horror just doesn't do much for me.  Not to mention that I can't remember the last Stephen King adaptation, except for The Mist, that was actually pretty good.  Well, I'm happy to say I finally gave 1408 a chance, and walked away quite satisfied, especially by the longer director's cut of the film that takes up the second disc of this Two-Disc Collector's Edition.  John Cusack stars as Mike Enslin, a jaded and somewhat haunted author who travels around to supposedly haunted places to debunk their myths.  Upon hearing of the bloody history of the Dolphin Hotel's haunted room 1408, Mike ends up taking it on, despite the warnings of the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson).  Needless to say, Mike gets much more than he bargained for, and it isn't long before he starts becoming a believer.  Directed with efficient dread and perfect pacing by Mikael Hfstrm, 1408 is carried by a spectacular performance from Cusack, and some truly scary moments to boot.  And while the theatrical version of the film isn't bad, it's the director's cut with an alternate ending that really deserves your attention, making 1408 one of the better Stephen King adaptations to see the light of day in the past few years.  All in all, if you're in the mood for some great suspense that actually will keep you guessing how it'll all end; 1408 is definitely worth a trip.",1226793600,,1431,4.696

John Cusack's performance holds this film together and he is very impressive as a writer whose job involves exposing haunting as fake. His cynical hack attitude makes the rising tension that much more effective. We see someone doubting his sanity and beliefs as the things he sees appear increasingly impossible.

Samuel L Jackson gives strong support as the hotel manager who tries to persuade him against staying in the cursed room. This is a very good shocker, strongly recommended.

2906146,5,B000TJ6PBU,"When 1408 was first released into theaters, I had heard mixed reviews, not from critics, but from friends of mine who had managed to catch screenings of it before I did. Not that that was hard to do, mind you, because I rarely, if ever, went to see films in the theaters. I think in recent years the only film I was going to see in theaters was 30 Days of Night, but was unable to due to a stint in the hospital. Going back to the mixed reviews, a friend of mine, who was also a big fan of horror movies, told me it was awful, not worth the money, and like an idiot I listened to her.
However, for some reason that I can not explain, when the film was released on DVD, I had this strange compulsion to watch it. I noticed it was On Demand one day, and I called my mom up and asked her what she thought of the movie (her and my father had seen it at the drive in). She said that she thought it was 'ok'. However, with all due respect to my mom, every film in her eyes except The Dark Knight is 'ok', and it's even harder for a horror film to please her. Against the odds, I rented the film and watched it. However, the On Demand version was the directors cut, but I still loved it.
Well, you can imagine my surprise when I watched the theatrical version and the original ending came along. The things that really stuck out about this, though, was John Cusack's performance. It was incredible. I had never really been a fan of him before this- he had never really done horror films, and I tend to watch pretty much only horror. But he blew me away with this. The direction was strong, Samuel L was in it (which is always props to me), and it wasn't relying on blood and guts, like the Hostel or Saw franchises. I must admit it scared me that the film was rated PG-13, but for a PG-13 film, it got away with quite a few uses of the F word (when Cusack hurts his hand).
As for this DVD... I love it, I love the postcards it came with, and the very, VERY short making of's, and the fact that it has both versions of the film, but... It's kind of disappointing. Why couldn't they put both versions of the film on disc one and LOAD the second disc with extras and making of's, kind of like the Batman Begins DVD did? If you're looking for behind the scenes footage, you'll find, oh, I'm guessing... ten minutes worth? It's a good ten minutes, but it could have been much, much more.
Since I tend to read reviews on Amazon for information on the DVD extras and not the film itself, that is what is most crucial for me to reiterate in my review. This DVD is NOT a Collectors Edition, it is a 'spend more money for two versions of the film and ten minutes of behind the scenes!' But it's a cool ten minutes, and I guess even though I'm disappointed with the content, I say buy it if you love the movie. I mean, why not?

The two-disc DVD of 1408 had a second disc with the director's original ending, which was a bit of a downer.  I understood why it was reshot, as the ending shown in theaters framed the action with a bit more meaning and a bit less nihilism.  Anyway, I bought the blu-ray version for the better picture quality and the slimmer, space-saving package.  In checking the packaging, it looked like the blu-ray was pretty much the same as the two-disc DVD.  WRONG!  THE BLU-RAY HAS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT ENDING!  Nowhere on the package is this indicated.  Granted, the ending seen in theaters is available in the special features as an isolated scene... but I don't want that.  I want what the package implies: the theatrical cut in the blu-ray format.

2906150,1,B000TJ6PBU,"John Cusack - a great actor - is very good as the protagonist of this story: an once honest author who now makes up stories about haunted hotels. So he is a non believer... and when faced with a hotel room everybody fears, it is obvious that he knows there's nothing in there except the imagination of those who enter the room.

That is a great premise... but here it fails completely because the film does not offer anything interesting, scary or simply offbeat to surprise the audience.

It all starts beautifully, as Cusack spends the first few minutes in the room and discovers there is something there that puts chocolate on his bed and replaces toilet paper... and turns on the radio that plays The Carpenters.

But that's all... in a few minutes, the room becomes a roller coaster ride... ghosts can be seen jumping out the window... a window closes on Cusack's hand... the key breaks... and soon he discovers he is in one of those places in movies that we hate: a kind of parallel universe where anything goes: it rains... strange noises... it gets too cold... he sees his dead father... he sees his dead daughter... the wall has cracks and drips blood (how unoriginal!)... it snows... the paintings on the wall seem to move... the room gets flooded... the TV shows things... the radio keeps playing while unplugged... etcetera.

We've seen it all before and it is all harmless like the haunted house in Disneyland.

What I hate the most here is that the horror of this film is just a stupid sequence of idiotic tricks. Look: it's a guy locked in a hotel room for one hour. What fabulous ideas are there that turns this constriction into an advantage? None.

Nothing scary here. This is a badly conceived project. Not all horror books can turn into great horror films.",1220400000,13,1776,4.622222222222222

!408 doesn't have any monsters, or blood and guts, but is a really good retelling of Steven Kings short story about the hotel room from hell. Samuel L Jackson plays the hotel manager who tries to discourage Mike from spending the night there. Although he part is small in the film Mr Jackson's character wash skillfully done, and helps make the film the jewel that it is.
The story is told in the style of a twilight zone episode, only better.

2906168,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Steven King has long been a favorite author of mine and 1408 is just another basic example of his work. I quite liked this movie adaptation but I have yet to read the original story. While the movie is not particularly scary, it certainly has a creepiness all its own. There a few twists and turns including one very big and...shall I say, misleading, one in the latter half of the film. My main concern with this movie on the other hand, is that it includes a lot of back-story and other plot elements that don't seem to flesh out or get explained at all by the end of the film
1408's acting isn't really much to talk about but it is quite good nonetheless. John Cusack's character is a rather typical caricature of the cynical man who ""believes in nothing but himself"" and has a dry sarcastic comment for everything. The movie spends the largest amount of its time around Mike Enslin for obvious reasons. I haven't really seen him act in much else but he certainly does a good job in this movie especially since he was forced to act by himself and respond terrified to nothing. Samuel Jackson acts pretty much the same as he does in most of his movies but with significantly less yelling. The first exchange between the two characters in particular is a fine display of their acting talent.

All together, 1408 is entertaining enough that a second view can be just as enjoyable as the first even after all the twists have been exposed. Eventually I'd like to see more Steven King adaptations but for now this is one of my favorites (second to Secret Window). If you enjoy a creepy but fun film or are a big Steven King fan than I certainly recommend this film.",1215216000,,1662,4.449180327868852
2906169,5,B000TJ6PBU,"The number of films adapted from a work by Stephen King are too numerous to list here; but, the number of excellent movies based on a story or novel by the horror maestro is a lot shorter--The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, Misery, The Dead Zone, Hearts of Atlantis, Delores Clairborn, The Mist, Cujo, and now, 1408.  This movie, starring John Cusack, was one of the best films that I saw last year, and the Director's Cut with an alternate ending on the special two-disc DVD collection is just as good, if not better in my opinion.

For those of you not familiar with either the story or film, John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a man who travels around the country and debunks the myth of haunted houses and rooms, publishing the results in his ""occult travel guides.""  He simply doesn't believe in the afterlife or the supernatural, or anything for that matter, especially since the death of his young daughter from an illness.  Everything changes, however, when he visits the Dolphin Hotel in New York City and stays in the infamous Room 1408.  Though the manager of the hotel (played wonderfully by Samuel L. Jackson) warns him about the dangers of the room and the large number of people who have died there, Cusack's character thinks it's all a bunch of hot air, designed to attract people to the hotel and increase the business's revenue.  Once Cusack gets settled into the room, things start happening to slowly change his mind and by the last quarter of the film, he's struggling just to stay alive.  That's when he decides to fight back and to figure out a way to destroy the room and its evil.

For me, this was one of John Cusack's best roles.  He carried ninety percent of the film on his shoulders and did so brilliantly.  I believed in him and his character, and I desperately wanted Mike Enslin to make it out of the room alive.  Samuel L. Jackson also did a great job as the smooth talking manager who knows the truth about Room 1408 and decides to let John Cusack do what he has to do.  The special effects of the film are believable and extremely intense and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, spilling the popcorn on the floor.  I also have to say that though I really enjoyed the theatrical version of the movie, I think the Director's Cut on the two-disc set was even better.  It was longer with an additional seventeen minutes added to the last third of the film, and the alternate ending was more realistic.  If you're a fan of Stephen King's writing, or an avid viewer of horror flicks, I would highly recommend this movie.  It's one of the better films to be done from the horror writer's stories and definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last few years.",1214438400,,2730,4.495951417004049
2906170,3,B000TJ6PBU,"""1408"" is based on an original Stephen King short abandons for the most part the use of overt gore and jumpy ""boo"" scenes in a smart move away from a trend we've been seeing in some modern horror movies, such as ""The Hostel"" or ""Cabin Fever"". Don't get me wrong though, gore in a horror movie (or otherwise) can have its place, if it's done well and inserted properly. But some films just don't need it. ""1408"" is such a film and relies on spooky tension building to get its point across.

The film, which received an 18 certificate in Britain and remarkably a PG-13 certificate in the US, stars the under-used John Cusack as Mike Enslin, a sardonic and cynical writer of paranormal debunking who checks into the Dolphin hotel in New York to embark on his latest project. The 1408 of the title is a room that has seen a large number of deaths, ranging from window jumpers to drowning in soup and the manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), is reluctant to let Enslin stay in it. Nobody has lasted more than an hour in room 1408, Olin informs Enslin and hands him a thick dossier on the people who have been driven insane to the point of their demise in the room.

Enslin won't be deterred however and insists on staying the night, intent on proving that there is nothing supernatural about the room at all. After entering the room, he remains unconvinced for the better part of the first half of the movie, but the increasing level of strange goings-on help him to come to his senses. It seems Mike Ensln has finally found proof of the existence of the paranormal he is so dismissive of in his everyday life.

The viewer is helped to believe this too, by the top marks effort of John Cusack, who for a great many scenes is completely alone. There is only him and the audience dealing with the ghostly occurrences playing out on the screen and Cusack does well to covey what Enslin is thinking and feeling, by not only making use of his great ability to deliver a timely wisecrack or deadpan one liner, but also convincingly performing his characters ever growing fear.

A quietly unsettling Samuel L Jackson offers a sterling support performance in what I believe to be one of his better onscreen efforts and he does a lot to help build the foundations of the suspense that drives the first part of the film.

Fine support also comes from Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony, who play Enslin's estranged wife and dead daughter, in the movie's sub-plot, which is one of the stronger elements of the production.

The weaker sides to 1408, however, become apparent in the second half of the movie as the room's subtle attempts to drive Enslin nuts are replaced by the over the top. The ""turn down service"" toilet roll creepiness and spine tingling repetition of ""We've Only Just Begun"" on a clock radio give way to severe climate change and some on-location hallucinations that just aren't as effective as the events that actually take place within the confines of the hotel room. It's also clear that the producers were unsure how to finish the film, which has led to a number of alternative endings. The ""Director's cut"" DVD has replaced the ending in theatre's with the one that Mikael Hfstrm originally wanted and there is also another ending involving Enslins publisher, Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub).

Inevitably, there have been unfavourable comparisons to Stephen King's other hotel horror, ""The Shining"", but ""1408"" is a different creature altogether. Whereas Kubrick's ""The Shining"" kept me interested for its full running time, Hfstrm's effort unfortunately trailed off after the 45 minute mark. This is a shame because the first half setup indicated a very enjoyable overall movie. But ""1408"" just runs out of steam and instead of driving smoothly to it's ending, it tumbles toward it, leaving the viewer unsure whether it was an wholly successful experience.",1212451200,2,3887,4.732644017725258
2906171,3,B000TJ6PBU,"*1408* was an alright movie but I wouldn't exactly call it a scary movie.  To me, *1408* is just a movie version of *Tales from the Crypt* or *Amazing Stories*, something like that.

Cusack plays Enslin, a doubtful author who visits and publishes books on noted places of paranormal phenomena.  One day, Enslin gets an anonymous postcard about the famed room, 1408, of the Dolphin Hotel in NYC.  Unable to resist the temptation to debunk the hype, Enslin registers for the room.

Upon arrival, the hotel manager (Jackson) tries to dissuade Enslin from staying in that room.  Enslin is told of the grisly murders and strange occurrences/histories of room 1408.  However, nothing will prevent Enslin from staying in the room.

Upon entrance of 1408, Enslin is in a twilight zone.  Things are what they seemed to be.  Gradually, Enslin starts to believe that paranormal activities are real.  The question is...can Enslin come out of the room alive?

I thought *1408* was ok.  It wasn't scary or anything like that.  It was more of illusions or perceptions from Enslin, which could have been scary for him.  However, there was nothing scary for the audience.  There's a little too much talk.  More action, please!",1211241600,,1209,4.905940594059406

I really had no knowledge of the story so I was in away expecting a different kind of a thriller.  I expected a cleverly woven story of a mysterious room that had a fantastic story behind it which unravels throughout the movie.  That's not exactly it.  It is about a mysterious, devil of a room.  And not much else.  I also hoped to be frightened out of my wits but sadly it isn't that kind of a movie either.  Although there are occasions where I was startled by sudden entrances of ...ghosts?

Nevetheless, John Cusack and Sam Jackson were awesome.  Sam Jackson plays the hotel manager who tries to convince John to stay away from the room - 1408.  And John defies Sam's plea.  This was an awesome prelude to the main plot.  If the Jedi master tells you not to do something, it must be something scary.  Hence the more intriguing the room became (at least to me).

For the rest of the film, it's a one man show by John Cusack and he pulls off quite a performance.  The ending of the film was also quite alright.

2906174,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I am not a huge fan of horror.  I like ""thriller,"" but in last 25+ years most horror films have been ""slasher"" - blood, guts, and gore - instead of good, honest, edge of your seat psychological thriller.  1408, however, successfully returns the thriller genre to the big screen.

1408 pulls you in quickly and keeps on going.  The pacing is just right.  The intensity of this film is excellently timed, bringing you to your edge of your seat, and then releasing you.  This rollercoaster effect actually increases the ""thrill"" of the thriller; you do not get numb and disconnected from constant slashing and bashing, fright and horror.

The performances are terrific.  John Cusak is great as always. Samuel Jackson is riveting and appropriately spooky.  The little girl, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, is extremely talented.  The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job.

As I said, there is very blood, guts, and gore in this film; it is a true thriller.  It is the LACK of said blood, guts, and gore that gives this film its psychological edge, and prevents it from becoming a slash `em up film.

2906176,3,B000TJ6PBU,"1408's theatrical cut is just below mediocre but the director's cut is a solid four stars out of five and one of the most effective horror films in the last five to ten years.  So I went with three stars to balance things.  It is amazing that such little changes can have such a dramatic effect on one viewer's perception.  It's a shame that the Weinstein's decided to flub 1408 and give it a sappy and clich Hollywood ending rather than the dark and gutsy horror ending that Mikael Hfstrm decided to create.  This is the version that you folks in Europe and South American got to see in the theaters.  The director's cut certainly seems to be the real cut, as 1408 seems to move along at its own pace within that version.  It is simply a film about a man who checks into a hotel and we enjoy the suspense build up as the film's main protagonist soldiers forth.  Hfstrm clearly knows what he's doing and he is influenced by a bevy of horror's most keenly detailed films, and that is why it is such a shame that his punches are pulled by Dimension Films for the US audience.  His razors are dulled, his poison is given an antidote, and his biggest attack of all is completely de-clawed.  Shame on the Weinsteins and shame on the US audience that always has a hankering for these sappy moments of comforting resolve.  Other than that I have no strong feelings on the matter.

The Weinsteins did do one good thing and that is to suggest the casting of the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Mr. Gerald Olin.  He probably should've been played by some little old white guy with a fancy accent, but instead we get the absolutely iconic Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson is surely one of my favorite actors and it is simply because I enjoy watching him in anything he is in, and 1408 is no exception.  Jackson is like Jack Nicholson, he can play anything but it seems that creeping perpetually underneath every character he plays is a little bit of Sam winking at the audience as if to say ""it's me again"".  Olin is the formulaic old man who warns the kids not to go into that house or stay at that camp, and no one listens.  The problem is Jackson, as an icon, is traditionally such a great intimadator, but here he is the intimidated and yet he carries the same confidence in 1408 that he carries anywhere else.  He warns ghost skeptic and author Mike Enslin, played by the equally enjoyable John Cusack (if you don't believe me I recommend seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grace-Is-Gone/dp/B0013D8LBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grace Is Gone</a>) that his quest to find physical or visual validation of the supernatural will end in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, but it will very likely mean the end of Enslin's life as well.  1408 is an extremely evil room.  It would have to be if not even Jackson will go inside.

The screenplay is great and it is based on a Stephen King&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-story/dp/0743457358/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short story</a>&nbsp;I'm only familiar with by name.

Enslin is a loner, who the audience will either like or dislike, but his character is very strong and Cusack plays him as if the audience could take him or leave him as a viable hero.  The scenes with Cusack and Jackson together are very enjoyable to watch as the two are such dramatically different actors and their characters are so fundamentally strong and so fundamentally in opposition of each other within the context of this story.  These scenes work to further heighten your curiosity.  What the hell is going on inside room 1408 anyway!?  Don't you worry, the Weinsteins will protect you.",1206057600,17,3912,5.045101088646967

It's really hard to grasp how an interesting premise (that of a haunted Manhattan hotel room,) a fairly large budget, and the capabilities of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shaloub could be so entirely wasted.

Imagine the scene in ""The Shining"" where the caretaker encounters the woman in the bathtub but with little cartoon dialogue balloons popping up every fifteen seconds saying BOO and that's about as frightening as this embarrassing debacle ever gets. Lots of flames and water and sprayed on Christmas tree snow don't add up to fear. They add up to a total lack of cinematic creativity. Oh... and be sure to catch the pretentious making-of extras where the director and set designer bask in their own brilliance - talk about flaunting it without having it...

Instead look for a poorly publicized small budget international production entitled DARKNESS for ten times more intelligence, mood and creepiness in evidence. (See my review elsewhere.)

2906180,3,B000TJ6PBU,"I came to this movie prepared to enjoy it.
I read the story about a year ago, in the book ""Everthing's Eventual"", and ... it scared me stiff. Now I'm 40, and usually don't scare that easily, but this story was just terrifying ! Easily the ""best"" in the book. I've just finished watching the movie (15 minutes ago), and ... well, while it's OK, it just doesn't scare me. Ok, there are a good number of jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the same sort you get in a lot of scary and horror movies - looking in the mirror to find somebody behind you trying to bludgeon you, etc. - but that's about all.
While the camera work is good, the mood-setting is too contrived (creaking doors, chilling music to announce a scary or dangerous moment ahead, ...) It's a basic exercise in scary-movie-making, with the usual ingredients : the room changing, blood seeping from the walls, the light changing, temperatures dropping and rising, ... And while John Cusack's a good enough actor, I didn't find anything in there for him to sink his teeth into.
Now the story worked (for me) because, as it is written, the reader needs to get him/herself in the scene, has to imagine for her/himself what is actually happening, to see the action in their mind's eye, while reading it on paper. That takes a seriously good author. And Stephen King succeeded very well in that, here. That, coupled to the fact that the story itself is a short story, meaning it's ... short, maybe 10-20 pages, I don't exactly remember. The movie tries to extend this short story into more than 1 1/2 hours, so having to add a number of events, which, to me, only prolongs, draws out the story itself; and not in a sustained way. It didn't keep me riveted, wanting to keep watching every minute, expecting/fearing the next moment, as did the written story.
So in conclusion : OK, a few good scary moments, but a classic (not Classic, if you know what I mean) horror movie.

Weak lame scares, lame effects, and over all waste of time movie, no scary at all.

Cusack is very convincing as a washed up writer--Mike Enslin-- who, despite being an author of books about haunted places, does not really believe in ghosts. His mental descent from apathy and cynicism to a little bit of insanity and despair is very believable.

Room 1408 is perhaps the real star of the movie, with its ruthless pursuit of our main character. As Cusack is trapped in the room, he seemingly finds a way out only to be twarted by this very very evil but clever room. Many of the tricks the room pulls out of its sleeve are new, while some of them are very classic horror movie tricks. The movie has a few cheap ""jumpy"" scares, but these are not the focus of the movie. If you really watch the movie for what it is, rather than just a series of unlucky/frightful moments for Enslin, you can take more from it. I think Room 1408 is one of the most evil entities in horror film history. The depths to which the room tries to get to Enslin's psyche are just...ruthless. The psychological warfare on the Room's part is probably really what makes the movie different. For instance *****SPOILER***** I was convinced there was more to this movie by the ending especially--the part with Mike's tape recorder. What was left on the tape recorder was probably the worst moment in his life, left to be played over and over again. Torture.

I would probably have given this film a 4.5/5 if I could rather than a 5, but I give Stephen King the benefit of the doubt regarding some of the character development issues I feel he had with Enslin and his family. I'm sure you get a more complete sense of their situation in the actual short story.

Like I said, I like this movie. It's clever, unique, and much better than your average horror film. It's NOT a slasher. If someone gives this movie a 1, they either have not seen the movie OR they have not seen any other movies in the horror genre for the last 10 years OR they like the slasher flicks. If you're going for shock value in a horror movie--you will be disappointed in this movie. This is more of a thinking person's horror film; if you DON'T look past the surface of this film--I could see how it could be ""nothing special.""

And perhaps no author has had those movies turn out so differently - from great classics like ""The Shining"" on the one hand to bad classics like ""Maximum Overdrive"" on the other.  ""1408"" definitely falls onto the ""Shining"" half of the scales.

""1408"" is deliberately paced without dragging - a very difficult feat to accomplish.  Even harder to accomplish is making a movie interesting where a long stretch of it is one guy in a room.  It is a testament to John Cusack's acting skills and the director's ability that the times Cusack is in the room are not just interesting, but often gripping.  Lesser talents would have rendered this movie unwatchable.

""1408"" gives us some reason to care about Cusack such that we care about what he's going through.  And it builds horror through suspense, music and atmosphere, not buckets of blood (not that there's anything wrong with that).  This is old-school horror, not spam-in-a-cabin.  The ending was a bit of a letdown - both versions, even; but honestly, I don't know how you could have ended this movie any differently.

It's no biggy, considering how prolific his career has been.

""1408"" was a short story of his that was meant to be more of a creative exercise than anything else.  I've never thought King was much of a short story writer -- his imagination needs room to stretch; ""1408"" the story isn't so bad, but I remember wondering how on earth they planned to stretch it out to movie-length.  The writer in King's tale isn't in the deadly room for ten minutes before the story comes to a close.

It's hard to tell how long Cusak's Mike Enslin ends up in the room.  An hour at least.  The hotel room's powers make it hard to trust one's perceptions.  In fact, the whole of its horror is all about twisted perceptions, and therein lies the flaws of ""1408.""

Enslin is a hack writer (once talented and profound) who makes a living by exploiting areas that are supposedly haunted.  Due to a personal tragedy, Enslin is dead-set against belief in any kind of spirit world, making him both a hack and a hypocrite.  It isn't long after he's shut the door of ""1408"" behind him that his beliefs are tested by the room's weird, ambient horror.

Well, it's not exactly horrific.  King comes up with scary images, but without any supporting substance, they're really nothing more than images.  Bleeding walls.  Paintings with changing pictures.  Menacing spirits that appear and disappear.  Sure, it's creepy, but what's there to it?  As far as ""1408"" is concerned, there's only one goal: to drive Mr. Enslin mad enough to end his own life.

Cusak bears the lion's share of what makes the movie worth watching at all (Samuel Jackson is the other name of note, but all he does as far as this film is concerned is chew on both cigars and scenery).  Enslin's history with his wife and daughter, added for the film, make his experiences noteworthy, although not terribly frightening.  You want him to get out of the hotel, but the room's machinations are just a series of mental tricks.  Psychological horror is what it wants to be; random oddities is what it turns into.

King's stories, as far as their successes and failures go, are less about execution and mostly about the concepts that drive them.  ""1408"" struggles with both.  Cusak keeps things fresh and interesting, but I can't say the same for the hotel room in which he struggles to survive.",1201564800,17,3176,5.687898089171974

With several books under his belt, he's become numb to the supposedly haunted surroundings he puts himself into.  Until he hears about room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  In order to check into room 1408, Mike must get his attorney involved, regarding some blue law that if the room requested is unoccupied it must be rented upon request.  It's the only way Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson), manager of the Dolphin, will rent the room to Enslin.

Enslin checks in, under the caution from Olin that no one has ever lasted longer than one hour in the room.  At first, its an ordinary room.  But then things start happening.  The clock radio continuously goes off on its own, playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" each time.  The room warps, the pictures come alive, ghosts appear, the door locks itself, the thermostat malfunctions, and visions from Enslin's horrible past with his wife and daughter begin to infiltrate reality.

Cusack's performance is excellent, as is Samuel Jackson and Tony Sheloub (Enslin's attorney).  This is probably Cusack's best performance of his career, very believable.

I read the short story before watching the movie and actually wished that I hadn't.  I believe the movie would have intrigued me better if I hadn't seen the changes made to the story in order to make it movie material.  The creeping madness of the story was lost on film.  Too much of the fear was internal and hard to transfer to movie entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a great movie either.

Not that long ago ""horror"" works (written and on film) used the audience's own imagination to get under your skin.  ""1408"", based on a Stephen King story, harkens back to that idea - terrifying you with what's on the screen, but even more with what is SUGGESTED on the screen, with you filling in the blanks.

John Cusack is great at playing likable guys and here he plays the King surrogate (aren't all of King's stories either about writers or set in Maine? but I digress...) Mike Enslin is a published, but not on the King/Rowling circuit, writer.  He travels between ""haunted"" places and bookstores, debunking the ""haunted"" places, but writing about them in his books. (Ten Haunted Houses, Ten Haunted Lighthouses, etc.)

He receives a postcard for the Dolphin Hotel in New York with a warning to not go into room 1408.  He goes.

There is a nice scene of exposition with Samuel Jackson as the hotel manager who gives a 100 year history of this evil f-ing room, all but begging Enslin not to go there.

But you know he will...

The essence of the story is that Mike Enslin (John Cusack) plays a cynical writer who pens reviews of supposedly haunted hotel rooms.  And why wouldn't he be cynical?  Stories of haunted rooms are a dime a dozen and who believes in ghosts?  Well, certainly not Mike Enslin.

After receiving some anonymous mail, Enslin books into room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan.  He is implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) not to choose the room.  There have apparently been countless largely unexplained deaths in that very room.  Enslin, however, is a persistent man and he will not be convinced of the dangers.

At first glance, the room seems totally unremarkable.  But, after a short time, strange and sometimes chilling things begin to happen.  I can say that at times I was given goose bumps.  This film is largely able to find that delicate balance between schlock and horror.  This is a rare achievement as the film industry is littered with movies that are often trapped by the former whilst forgetting the latter.

Without spoiling the remaining plot of the film, there is an explanation for much of the various unexplained events.  Yet, it wouldn't be a good horror story without a twist in its tail.

He hears of a haunted hotel room and checks in even being warned about the room of 1408.  There was an evil so powerful that no one has survived an hour in that room.  This was a really frightening film especially when you see it in theaters because of all the jump scenes.  It feels like a scary twilight zone episode because of the chilling atmosphere.  It is also a psychological horror movie.  If you get the 2 disc version the first disc has the theatrical release also with the trailer.  Then the second disc has the extended directors cut with an alternate ending, commentaries, the secrets of 1408, and deleted scenes.  This was one of Stephen Kings best adaption of a short story.

2906192,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I didn't go see 1408 when it was in the theaters.  I intended to.  Life kept me away and it was gone.  So I was really looking forward to it when it came out on DVD.  And I ended up putting off watching it immediately.

I think part of the reason was that I really wanted to like it.  Stephen King, when he's on (and I think he will be in the upcoming DUMA KEY), can't be beaten in the creep-factor.  And John Cusack is just one of those actors that I can watch no matter what he's in (though my personal fave is GROSS POINTE BLANK).

Having them together was just a little bit of heaven.  In a hellish, possessed hotel room sort of way.  With Samuel L. Jackson playing a hotel manager who might not exactly be on the side of the angels.

Happily, I enjoyed the movie, got my quota of scary moments and John Cusack intensity/one-liner presentations.

There's nothing really new here.  King has pulled off bigger scare fests that still manage to touch the heart.  And Cusack has certainly performed in roles with more and deeper range.  But they definitely landed in fair territory (to use a baseball euphemism that King will appreciate) with this one.  You get more runs through base hits than with homeruns.  People just remember the homeruns more.

Cusack, likeable as always with a touch of the sardonic and sarcastic, portrays Mike Enslin, a writer of true horror who doesn't believe in the paranormal.  Despite his lack of beliefs, his books have done well enough to give him a decent life.  However, he's never gotten over losing his young daughter, Katie, to a terminal illness or his own loss of faith.  He puts God and ghosts on the same page and filed them all in the circular bin.

Until he reaches Room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  A mysterious postcard arrives and sets Enslin on the trail of the long line of deaths associated with the hotel room.  Even though he doesn't want to be, Enslin is captivated by the idea of the room.  He decides he needs to stay there for the night for the final chapter in his latest book.

The atmospheric build-up leading to Enslin's checking in at the Dolphin is so much a part of this story.  We can see that he's driven and missing a piece of himself, but we don't know what's driving him or what he's missing.  Then, as he researches all the deaths, I got hooked on the story.

I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good ghost story.  I love digging into the background of the coming tale, trying to guess what the writer is going to attempt to do to me during my stay.  I hadn't read King's short story in the collection EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, or if I had, it forgot it.  The screenwriter's outdid themselves on this one.  An overview of the short story shows that much of what they created for the movie wasn't in the short story, but the whole atmosphere was.  That's what King excels at when he's got his A-game.

After Cusack checks into the room, during the last hour of the film or so, 1408 almost becomes a one-man play.  Cusack carried the whole load of the movie on his shoulders and totally walked through it like he was out for a Sunday stroll.  Cusack nailed every emotion, his own as well as the ones he was trying to elicit from the audience.  He played me like a harp, and I've seen enough horror films and read enough Stephen King to stay one step ahead.  And I did, but the movie kept me constantly on the move to earn my one step.

The special effects are awesome, but they only work so well because of Cusack's performance and the pacing by the director, Mikael Hafstrom.  If the human element and the timing hadn't been there, it wouldn't have mattered how good the special effects were.  Audiences believe in character and atmosphere before they believe in cinematics.

As it turned out, because of the holidays, I ended up watching the movie one night, then again the next.  It held me captivated both nights, just watching Cusack go through his paces again as I picked up small nuances of the visual cues that I'd missed or neglected to pay as much attention to because I was pumping adrenaline the first time.

The only thing I can fault the movie for was not explaining why Room 1408 was haunted.  There's enough of a history there that I bought into the overall story, but usually movies and tales like these always nail down the ""origin"" story as well.  This one didn't and I was irritated enough to mention it.  Still, no matter what explanation had been provided, I might have discounted the threat if I'd known what the horror was actually caused by.

If you're a horror fan, there's a lot to like about 1408.  And if you want to sit down with the older kids on family night for a little chill and shiver, this movie is definitely one you can do that with because there's no obscenely bad language and the death scenes didn't push it past a PG-13 rating.

2906193,4,B000TJ6PBU,"In many ways 1408 reminds me of 1997's ""The Game,"" the Michael Douglas psychological thriller.  In both cases, the movies' writers try to cram a maximum number of head fakes into as short amount of time as possible. The two films also put forth the very implausible idea that if you manipulate a person's mind enough, and mentally break him, that somehow that's going to heal him, or at least begin the process of healing.  Count me as skeptical on that one.

The two movies do differ on the source of their protagonists' psychological and physical torture.  While The Game tries to make a non-supernatural case for psychotic manipulation, 1408 just presents the supernatural as fact.  In 1408, causes and motives for the supernatural events are irrelevant, with the minor implication, as presented by Samuel L. Jackson in a refrigerator of all places, that the people who stay in the inhospitable room are somehow guilty of bringing their doom upon themselves.

The DVD provides alternative endings to the movie release.  They're just as good in their own ways as the theatrical ending, which has the more palatable theme of restoration, rather than martyrdom.  Choose whichever ending suits your predilections.",1199318400,4,1212,5.055276381909548

It is almost as if writer and film director are trying to find every possible way known to mankind to kill this character.  The big premise of the film is actually play of our human psyche.  So if you are a parent, loosing a child would be one of the most fearful thought you could have.  Therefore, out ghosts in room 1408 play on main character's grief and guilt of not being able to protect his own child Katie of dying.  That emotion is the driving force of this film.  Adult viewing only.  Themes of suicide (i.e. jumping thru the window from the hotel's 14th floor) could be too disturbing for young audiences.",1199318400,3,1000,4.385869565217392
2906195,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Stephen King's works have uncertain box office fates, mostly because his epics don't translate well to the big screen.  There's too much story to completely translate, and the movies are often flimsy in comparison. His most successful movie adaptations: Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and Stand By Me were based on short stories, and the movies of his novels have suffered dismal fates: Dreamcatcher, Dark Half, Desperation, and the original `70's version of The Shining are excellent examples. The notable exception is Needful Things, mostly because of actor Ed Harris's capable performance.

King's miniseries usually fare better because they do his works more justice, but even then, they don't always succeed. Though Tim Curry nails Pennywise the evil clown, the mini-series It is laughable compared to its 1000+ novel counterpart. Rose Red was a great series and so was `Salem's Lot, but the actors cast in both fit their characters superbly - especially Rob Lowe in Lot. In The Stand, Gary Sinese fit the role of Stu Redman comfortably, but the mini-series doesn't approach the novel's epic proportions. Last summer's TNT mini-series, Nightmares & Dreamscapes, was wonderful - but again, based on his short stories.

The latest movie adaptation of a King story - 1408, a short story from his 2002 collection, Everything's Eventual, starring John Cusak and Samuel L. Jackson - blessedly belongs in the winner's circle.  This is King at his finest; there are spooks, creepy crawlies, and armrest-grabbing scenes galore, but at the core is something more resonant than just a good scare.

Michael Enslin is a renowned but cynical horror novelist whose career is evaporating. Nursing deep wounds from his only daughter's untimely death, separated from his wife, Enslin has traveled around the country, staying in ""haunted"" houses, hotels, and mansions, debunking supernatural stories. He's lost faith in God, heaven, life after death, and now seeks to disprove every haunting he can find.

With his latest project Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Hotel Rooms almost finished, Enslin receives a enigmatic postcard from the famed Dolphin Hotel in New York, inscribed only with, ""Don't Go Into 1408"".  Thinking it's just another elaborately designed hoax - right down to the hotel manager's, (played by Jackson), desperate urgings against the matter - Enslin checks into 1408, expecting another uneventful night.

He soon discovers that in his pride and arrogance, he's made a dreadful mistake, and whether or not he'll survive his hubris depends on how much terror he can take before the room forces him to kill himself.
1408 is delightfully creepy, but it's artfully frightening, unlike the gore-fests of the Hostel or Saw movies.  You'll jump at creaking floors and slamming doors, but like many Stephen King stories, the evil ""big bad"" is merely a plot device used to enrich character development.

From a faith perspective, it's always intriguing the themes King repeatedly uses: the power of faith, free will, the existence of God, and how loss of faith equates loss of self. As Enslin struggles to acknowledge the supernatural, the evil room plays out the most painful moments of his daughter's death, and he grapples with the concepts of heaven and God. At a pivotal moment, the evil room offers Enslin a choice, reminding him that opting for their ""speedy check-out service"" - a clever nom-de-plumb for suicide - is completely up to him, because like all the other hotel services, free will is part of the package.

Cusak gives his usually wonderful performance, sinking into the role of a grieving father and self-absorbed author easily, and Samuel L. Jackson is of course, Samuel L. Jackson - striking, intimidating, wise, and flippant all at once.  This is not just another scare-fest to be pulled out every Halloween and endured as a test of bravery; it's a chilling tale that's just as thought-provoking as it is frightening.

1408 is rated PG-13 for thematic material, disturbing sequences of violence and terror, frightening images and language.",1198713600,6,4060,5.170731707317073
2906196,4,B000TJ6PBU,"This is a creepy, scary movie.

It wisely starts off by setting up the main character, and making it clear that he's pretty bored with going to so-called haunted hotel rooms and finding nothing.  Apparently writing about having seen no ghosts doesn't sell many books, either, which may explain why there are so many authors that apparently see them, and not many that don't.

After the initial setup, which was very well paced, there is the (basically) one and only scene with Samuel L. Jackson, who must have been able to film all of his parts in a single day.  That's a shame, too, because he has a great deal of screen presence, and the parts he is in are very effective.

Then begins the roller-coaster ride of scary things that go bump in the night.  This is done a *lot* better than I expected, and there is quite a bit of frenetic energy in this scare-a-thon.

And then... the movie basically just ends.  It is almost like they weren't sure what to do, and just flipped the switch.  The final scene with his wife seemed tacked on.  I think it was intended to be some sort of revelation, but of what I'm not entirely sure. I guess that his next book is going to sell a lot better than the previous ones!",1198540800,3,1209,4.381165919282512
2906197,5,B000TJ6PBU,"When it comes to horror movies, I'm skeptical.  Especially when they're based on the works of authors I admire.  When it comes to horror writing, Stephen King is above par--he is the guy you compare all others to.  There have been some wonderful adaptations of his novels; there have been some horrendous adaptations as well.  Fortunately for all concerned, ""1408"" fits snugly into the former category.

Mike Enslin is a non-believer.  No ghosts, no goolies, not even a god.  He's searching, though; he looks everywhere for evidence of the paranormal, but has yet to see a glimpse.  Then he gets word of the Dolphin.  And room 1408.  He's warned to stay away.  The manager bribes him with expensive liquor.  But Mike doesn't listen.  And once he enters 1408, he has one hour to live.

This movie creeped me out.  I say that so bluntly because movies rarely creep me out.  ""The Exorcist"" does it.  ""Jaws"" does it.  A couple others, perhaps, but not many.  Of course you have your genuine shock moments--turn around and a guy slashes with a knife, some creep-o pops out of a ventilation shaft.  But true horror is atmospheric; and what's more atmospheric than a dingy, supposedly haunted hotel room?

If nothing else, ""1408"" shows that John Cusack has what it takes to carry a movie by himself.  Don't get me wrong--the acting is great.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is top-notch; his scene with Cusack in the office is tremendously entertaining.  But Cusack gets the majority of the screen time, mostly by himself.  His dry wit comes in handy to counter-balance the stark horror of the movie.  Not saying ""1408"" is a horror comedy; just saying, you'll probably get a laugh or two before you wet yourself in terror.  That should make up for any discomfort, I think.",1197676800,3,1766,4.76158940397351
2906198,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a travel writer who specializes in haunted locations.  When he discovers the Dolphin Hotel has a room responsible for numerous fatalities he can't resist the challenge of spending the night.  The hotel manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson) tries to talk him out of it, literally begs him to forego the night's stay but Enslin won't hear of it.  Enslin may write about the paranormal, but he doesn't actually believe in it.  Needless to say, room 1408 will change all of that.  Things start slow and then get progressively nasty as the room torments him relentlessly.

John Cusack gives an excellent performance as burned out Mike Enslin.  As we learn more about his past involving the death of his child and his failed marriage, Cusack does a great job of conveying the emotions of his shattered character.  Samuel Jackson is also strong as Olin.  He's strong, poised, and believable as an upscale hotel manager.  The two actors also work well onscreen together.  In some ways, the highlight of the movie is early on when they go head-to-head in Olin's office.

Like any good horror movie, things start off slow and then the tension starts to build.  There are plenty of creepy happenings, some ""gotcha"" jump moments, and the underlying story is more than interesting.  The ending is fairly inventive and satisfying.

The movie is similar up to a point but goes in its own direction for most of the second half.

My criteria for a horror film are simple.  If I feel plenty of tension from the suspense of what will happen next and it doesn't completely gross me out with gore, then it's a winner.

Samuel L. Jackson plays a dignified manager at an upscale, posh hotel in New York that just happens to have the most haunted room in history.  Room 1408 has had 56 deaths to date, and despite the room's reputation, the hotel is very expensive and busy.  Ignoring that perplexing contradiction, Samuel L. Jackson delivers as he always does, and keeps his career-long streak of dropping the F-bomb alive.

What transpires is a reversal of Enslin's cynicism and doubt, as he realizes that all the previous debunking he has done at other rooms doesn't help him at all in 1408.  It's basically a hotel room taking on a life of its own - think Event Horizon on the 14th floor - and doing everything possible to scare Enslin senseless, and possibly lead to his death.",1196985600,,1311,4.665217391304348
2906201,3,B000TJ6PBU,"Not being a fan of horror, for me awards this film additional credit, than if I was to watch it being a fan of the horror genre. The film takes the usual haunted house concept eg. ""family/person moves into new home - house turns out to be haunted"", but adds a unique twist to it. That being the fact that the haunted location, happens to be an ordinary apartment amongst hundreds of others, just the same.

John Cusack plays a writer who visits supposably haunted locations, in which to find inspiration for his novels. The catch being that he doesnt accually believe in ghosts himself. The room 1408 becomes a very new experience for him.

The backbone for this story is based apon Cusak's characters' past issues and we become more open to him as a person in his time within the room 1408.

Apart from a lot of traditional horror routines and obvious twists, the story flows well and is enjoyable to watch. For the film that it is I grant it 3 and a half stars and it sits amongst some of the better Steven king flicks. Enjoy!",1196812800,7,1028,4.4
2906202,3,B000TJ6PBU,"What is the cause of fear?

Why are we afraid of the dark?  Why are we so often scared going into unknown places?

It's simple survival. The fight of flight instinct. The fear of dying. We have no idea what awaits us on the other side once we leave this mortal coil.

It's also because of the unknown.

As a species, we are instinctively are afraid of what we don't know. It presents an X-factor to us. We have no idea if it's going to harm or help us. So, it goes without saying we fear what awaits us after death because NO ONE KNOWS what will happen!

Many people believe in ghosts. Spirits, poltergeists, phantoms, shades - just to name a few. Of course it has to be asked, what are these? Are they really the souls of the dearly departed who're unable to cross over because of some deed they've committed, something they left undone? Maybe they simply lost their way and haven't been able to find the light?

Or maybe something is keeping them here.

There are places all across the globe where ghosts are reputed to be. Homes, hospitals, battlefields... usually places of strong emotion or violence, and of course, death.

Stephen King wrote a novel called 1408. It's about a writer dealing with his own personal demons (typical King type character), who makes a living writing about haunted locations.

He's written a book about the ten most haunted hotels across the nation, and does research by going to these homes away from home and staying in them, in the rooms that are reportedly haunted.

It's a means of income for not only him, but for the owners of these hotels. For some god only knows reason, there are people out there who are fascinated by hauntings and whenever he mentions these hotels, the bookings go up dramatically for the owners.

Personally, I don't believe in Ghosts. I've never seen one, or for that matter had any supernatural encounters, even though several of my friends and even my wife have had these types of encounters. Frankly, I never want to have one.

Am I afraid of these spectres? Damn straight! They're unknown, and thus, they could be dangerous. So I avoid any place where there are supposed ghosts.

I digress.

The writer learns of a hotel called the Dolphin in New York City where there is a room - 1408, that has a deadly history. Over Fifty guests have died in this room, and no one has lasted more than an hour.

Obviously he's intrigued and decides that he has to see it. See, he's become jaded because of all the places he's visited and never once has had an encounter with the supernatural.  Just once he would like to encounter something.

Despite the aggressive attempts of the hotel manager to persuade him to not stay in the room, he wins out and is given the key and settles in to wait for the fun to begin.

I didn't find the movie particularly scary, although once he got into the room; I found it a little stressful - waiting for something to happen. That's the biggest thing for me, the wait. Once things start, then I relax.

There was, thankfully, very little in the way of gore in the movie. It had a few of what you would call `jump' scares, where something happened suddenly and causes you to jump.

Once the action started, I found it entertaining, and not in a bad way. It was fun watching the events unfold, and to see the malevolent spirit of the room come to life. Once the room has someone inside and the countdown begins that's it, they will not be allowed to leave.

Alive that is.

I won't deny that I found part of the movie to be very confusing, and at this point in time I'm still wondering what really happened to the poor unfortunate author who stayed in the room.

I will not give away the ending for you, as you should see it for yourself.

Half decent special effects, some truly chilling moments - over all, not bad, not overly scary. Good for a couple of hours of entertainment.

As of this review, I haven't bothered with the special features, although the DVD is supposed to have cut scenes and an alternate ending. You'll have to check them out on your own and decide for yourself.

Yeah, that is my own innner child screaming for some innate understanding of the particulars of a movie, as opposed to blanket generalities, and for a lax reviewer I suppose that is a bias. Well so be it. The only saving grace in the movie was when Cusack, who is bland, detached and feverishly boring, orders a double Patron chilled. High fives on the couch abounded after that remark.

Samuel L. Jackson. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How painful to watch him in anything. If he ever did anything good, it was because the people that he was sharing the screen with had the talent. He just shined off them. Go ahead and think about it. If his performances in the Star Wars films wasn't enough to send him a check to personally have him never to appear on the big screen again, we have this ersatz for talent appearing as a hotel manager, who is not in the least disturbingly scary. One would think, save wooden and pretentiously arrogant in most roles, he would have made the viewer all the more wary of having Cusak's character actually enter 1408. I mean there is this huge set up now about not entering the room, that charge that a REALLY REALLY good director, like well ya know, DePalma, Kubrick, Demme, would have made tres important, so that myself, and perhaps others, could really get the hairs on our arms doing backflips in anticipation of the horrors that await.

2906211,4,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is an effective film adaptation of the Stephen King (audio) short story.  John Cusack does a credible job as the protagonist Mike Enslin, a cynical writer of non-fiction books who visits allegedly spooky places to debunk their claims of ghostly specters.  Against the advice of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin visits a supposedly haunted room in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, insisting on staying in Room 1408, the locus of many a tragic event.  He finds that painful memories flood his mind as he descends progressively into the grip of the hotel's malevolent power.  The special effects are spooky and just short of over the top.

Some viewers may criticize the film's lack of realism, most notably the ability of anyone other than a rock star or royalty to get a hotel room this large in New York City.  More likely you get a room so small that you have to step outside just to change your mind.  But what can you expect for a mere $617.00 a night in Gotham, the City that Never Sleeps?

Or talk about scary -- $12 for a 4-oz. tin of honey roasted peanuts in the Honor Bar?  Frightening!!

1408 is an effective fright charge likely to ignite shudders for those who like spooky movies, almost as scary as trying to find an economical hotel room in NYC!!!",1195603200,3,1281,4.554585152838428
2906212,5,B000TJ6PBU,"I was really pleased to see this genuinely scary flick WITHOUT all the blood and guts and slashing and killing.  I am sooo sick of all that shock-value trash!  I want suspense.  I want to hear my heart thump because I don't know what's gonna happen next, and this is it!  This was a well done horror flick.  I watched it right before bedtime, so I had to have a little pep talk with myself before I went to sleep.

John Cusack is outstanding in his role as Mike Enslin, a cynical hardened writer of mainly books that challenge ""haunted"" hotels.  Mike stays in the ""haunted"" room for the night, but never sees any ghosts.  Then he comes back and debunks the so-called haunted hotel.  Mike is a hardened soul who really doesn't seem to believe in anything, nor really care about anything since the death of his young daughter and the subsequent break up of his marriage.  You get the impression that his books aren't very good either.  He seems to have just kind of dried up inside.

Anyway, Mike meets his match when he arrives at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, to stay at the alledged haunted room 1408.  Prior to his arrival, the Dolphin will not even accept a reservation from him for that room.  Upon his arrival and insistance, he is greeted by Samuel L. Jackson, the hotel manager.  Mr. Jackson tries everything to persuade Mike NOT to stay in 1408.  He even tells him the room is just ""fxxxxxx"" evil, but cannot convince cynical Mike. He shows him black and white photos of some bloody dead people (which is as gory as it gets) from that room and tells him about many many deaths associated with the room, but Mike thinks it's just a snow job and insists on staying.  By the way, Samuel Jackson adds just the right amount of creepyness to his part.

So, Mike is led to his room and the manager departs his company at the elevator.  Things begin to happen very soon after Mike gets this attitude that nothing is going to happen.  First a window comes down and cracks open Mikes hand, and the clock mysteriously resets itself on a 60 minute countdown while it starts playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" by the Carpenters'.  A little at a time, all heck begins to break loose.  I can't tell you anymore without ruining the movie for you, but if you want a good scare, this should do it.  It's full of surprises and real heart-thumping terror.  When it's finally over you say, ""Whew!"" and are glad you're alive.

No, I do NOT recommend it for children. Let them have their sweet childhood dreams as long as they can. By the way, I am pleased to say that I don't remember any foul language in the movie other than the comment by the hotel manager (above) for emphasis.

It will be a real ghost hunt, a la 'The Haunting', or even, 'The Haunting of Hell House'"". I was really looking forward to seeing it, and it was Halloween, too, for heavens sake.

Sadly, though, it's a directionless, meandering bore.  The ""horror"" is more like improvisation, bringing with it only low-grade ""pop-up"" dramatic effects that work by surprise and little else.

In fairness to John Cusack, I don't know that anyone could have made this inane smorgasbord attempt at horror work any better than he did. It just kept on looking like this boring twenty-something in reaction to these ""frightening"" stimuli. It just didn't work.  You watch Cusack bounce around from one little horror-vignette to another and get more and more bored. Cusack is all hard-boiled when he gets to the hotel, stone-faced with toughness in the face of the warnings, then, he's ready to bolt out the bedroom window in fifteen minutes. And not that much had even happened yet. Lurch, halt, lurch, halt, etc., etc.

Samuel L. Jackson has a formidable presence, and I'd hoped that he might be able to help the story, but it was pretty obvious a short way into the movie that he was mis-cast, and probably should have stayed on that plane with the snakes....

Truthfully, this was such a boring movie that I fell asleep in the middle of it, but awoke in time to resume my impression of being thoroughly disappointed. To like this thing you're probably going to have to be a died-in-the-wool King fan, and you're going to have to like the twenty-something cuteness of Cusack, no matter how ridiculous it appears in this movie.

A haunted hotel room is not an original premise by any means......but like most over-played movie themes (such as vampires or super heroes or cops), it's what you do with it that matters.  John Cusack plays a writer (did anyone else notice S. King does too many stories where a writer is the main protagonist?) who investigates supposedly haunted places, hoping to expose them as hoaxes while still writing scary stuff to sell books.  He goes to a hotel after receiving a warning to stay out of Room 1408.  He doesn't expect to find much, and is brutally, unpleasantly surprised.  The special effects are great!  John C. does a wonderful job portraying the cynical, uninspired writer with unresolved personal issues of his own.  Samuel L. Jackson is great as the hotel administrator who tries to dissuade the writer from spending the night in the forbidden room.  All around, the acting is strong, more than enhancing a 4-star script.  There are some good things here, some of which are fairly original.  It's a reasonably scary movie.

2906216,2,B000TJ6PBU,"I must not ""get"" Stephen King. I rarely like any of the movies made from his books (Misery is an exception), and have only truly been satisfied from his shorter works, of which The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me are perfect examples.

1408 - hasn't it's premise been done to death? A strange hotel with a stranger general manager, a haunted room, mysterious ghosts and figures appearing and disappearing, rarely in a pattern that makes sense? Yeah, it has. And all of the good acting and top-notch special effects end up being nothing more than cheap window dressing, and window dressing has never saved a film.

It's probably true that there are no more original stories to be told, but I need a more distinctive stamp of novelty before I'll buy into listening to, reading, or watching another take an age old concept.

The ending was supposed to be shocking. Really? It was as predictable as an ending can be. Although I should admit that I kept expecting aliens to pop out of nowhere and take credit for the haunting. But he's done that, already, in how many movies?

I have to admit that I feel strange criticizing the work of a man who has written more books than I could contemplate writing, but in his book On Writing, King said that he essentially follows tangents and lets them lead him through his work. It's a formula that has sold tens, if not hundreds of millions of books for him, but not a formula that any student of writing should consider. To blindly follow a tangent without stopping to ask yourself questions like ""Does this make sense?"" can only lead to ruin.",1194220800,6,1586,4.593639575971731
2906217,2,B000TJ6PBU,"As with a lot of Stephen King ""movies of the week"", 1408 has - for the avid Regular King Reader(TM) - ups and downs. So let me put the review in a similar dual way.

First, as a movie all of itself, 1408 works. It's a Haunted Mansion/Closed Door story where the character (who, of course, doesn't believe in ghoulies, ghosties and beasties) finds himself trapped inside a hotel room that is supposed to be haunted; after a couple of minutes of paranoia (the hotel needs some advertising and people play the haunting ploy by remaking his bed and rehanging the toilet paper, that's all there is to it. Or, hey, maybe the glass of cognac was laced!), the main character, Michael Enslin, begins to realize that there is something wrong, there, after all. As the story progresses, the room becomes more and more violent, using Mike's own ghosts of the past to drive him crazy (a nice little backstory that is a little clich, and the similarly standard ""who's haunted: the man or the house"". The Shining, anyone?).
The movie works towards a climax that is, in the original, a standard PG-13 ending, and, in the Director's cut, a more ambiguous (and, god-forbid, sequel-begging). The faux escape scene is haunting on its own (and vaguely resembles a ""The Prisoner"" premise). All in all, all by itself, this movie rates about 3 stars, both for the original which is closer to the short story, and the director's cut.

Now, for the Regular Readers(tm)...

1408 is a short story in the collection ""Everything's Eventual"", that has the following premise: a writer (who carries some disappointment in both his original writing career and anything that's supposed to be haunted) enters a hotel that has a room that's - supposed to be - haunted. After an uneffective chat with the hotel manager he goes into the room and finds that it is not necessarily *haunted*, but there's something really, really wrong.
The story draws on Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the room is portrayed as a gateway to the other side, where the Old Ones reside. The character doesn't really have a backstory for the room to prey on, but with Cthulhu, that's not necessary.

And THIS is where the movie - for a Regular King Reader(tm), anyway - fails. The movie doesn't use the genuinely creepy Cthulhu Mythos premise, but turns the story in a Stanley Kubrick The Shining makeover, where the main character himself already carries some ghosts with him. All in all, there's a very Hollywood good vs. evil thing going on (and I've seen reviews where the room is called ""Hell"" - come on, people, does everything have to have that God vs. Devil thing to be creepy, these days? And then there's the fact that Mike denounced God because of his daughter dying: (quote) ""And then we find out that there really is no God to protect us from anything, is there?"".), where the main character either survives (""good wins"", theatrical version - Mike finds God again) or doesn't (""evil prevails, but still sort of loses"", director's cut, Mike still denies God exists).

The written story works on a much better level, because there's no ""good"" (God) or ""evil"" (Devil), just the Old Ones with their own undefinable purposes who maybe don't win, but they sure as hell don't let go of Mr. Enslin. If he didn't have any ghosts at the start of the story, he sure as heck does at the end.

From this point of view, the story gets one star, no more. Together with the three stars above, that evens out to a ""meh"" two stars.

As with many Stephen King movies, there's some ambivalence regarding story integrity and the ""what works for a movie audience"" factor. The story's original premise has been altered ( la Kubrick's ""The Shining""), but the acting is solid (and almost reaches the level of ""Misery"" and ""Cujo"").",1194134400,5,3757,4.7006079027355625

I wish I knew what could have been done to make the movie better, but its hard to pinpoint exactly what I hated a about it... perhaps I went in expecting too much? Perhaps I was scared about the occurrences in the room because I frequently stay in hotel rooms? Or perhaps it was just a bad film?

2906221,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Although I've enjoyed Stephen King's books for many years, the film adaptations have been pretty much hit-or-miss affairs. This film is one of the better ones. It is an adaptation of one of his short stories, a pretty straightforward tale about an ""evil"" hotel room and a skeptical horror writer's brief stay in it.

There is no gore, little blood, and little in the way of shocks. If those are your requirements for a horror film, you had best stay away. It is closer to a psychological thriller than a typical horror movie. It is essentially a one-man show and John Cusack as the writer acquits himself admirably. He is the quintessential everyman that we find in all of Stephen King's books. Actually the character could almost be King himself. The scene in the bookshop where he goes to promote his new book is pretty funny and reminiscent of something that King himself experienced in Australia when he was chased out of a local bookstore by clueless store-clerks who thought he was a vandal defacing their merchandise. The film is a fine mix of comedy and horror. Witness Cusack's cynical and deadpan ""That's it?"" when he first enters the much-hyped room 1408, followed by the room's welcoming ditty ""We've Only Just Begun"" sung by the golden-voiced Karen Carpenter.

The version to get is the 2-disc Collector's Edition. This is the only way you'll get to see the ""Director's Cut"" which is found on Disc 2. It also includes an engaging commentary from Swedish director Mikael Hfstrm and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The Director's Cut is about 8 minutes longer and contains several new and extended scenes as well as a very different ending. Neither version is similar to the original short story. Hfstrm explains why the ending was changed - test audiences didn't like the original ending. Hfstrm claims that he eventually grew to prefer the ending of the theatrical cut but after watching both, my preference is for the darker ending of the original. In either case, there is no happy-ever-after. I found the original darker ending to be more in keeping with the logic of the film but from test screenings it would seem that most viewers would prefer something lighter. You can compare for yourself on this double-disc set. There are also 11-minutes worth of deleted scenes with Hfstrm explaining why they were removed and about a half-hour's worth of production featurettes. At just $3 more than the single-disc standard edition, the Collector's set is the one to go for.",1193875200,43,2499,4.87764705882353

That really is the key to what they have on film, the fragmentary nature of the experience and the way the story emulates a dream so closely. The sound in the theatre was great, and the DVD sound is superb. The Camera work is great work  also.
Especially on second and third viewings.
I watched the Directors cut first, especially since I had seen the thetarical release of the film first and was utterly blown away with the sound , the quality of film, and the things I had remembered. Having a 5.1 system at home, my system is closer to me than the theatre ( but not better than the theatre) so, I can get a loud effect, as well as a full sound effect. Its really mostly in the final third that the major changes are placed, but when seeing the film additional times, the first two thirds are so well crafted and well acted that when they stand up so well, its really a great statement about the film.
The DVD is Well Packaged, and looks Great for the extra price. The 5 Cards you get are a great buzz, but did anyone get the ""Don't visit Room 1408"" Card ? Disc One has only a Few extras, rather few  in fact, but disc two has an abundance including some deletions that show some possible ambiguities in the role of Mr Olin. The Commentary is technically informative , but not, I would say entertaining: it rather shows how the Swedes can produce technically great films,but need good screen writers to do the frontline job. If you like the two different version of the film, skip the Commentary.

I like John Cusack. I like many of Stephen King's major works, particularly when he paints a broad canvas like ""The Stand"" or ""Cell. But this eternal industry of finding every piece of dreck he ever wrote and trying to turn it into a movie or mini-series really has to come to a screeching halt.

This boooooooooring movie is simply an effort to rehash old ground already mined successfully in ""The Shining"", as far as I could tell before I was sitting cross-eyed on my couch trying to recover from irreparable brain-cell damage due to mind-numbing unoriginality and lack of suspense.

If you feel you must absolutely see this thing, save your money, and borrow it from a library, or some friend who was unfortunate enough to spend their own hard-earned bucks on something that's not worth the label printed on its cover.

I mean who doesn't love just about everything John Cusack appears in? Add the imposing figure of Samuel L. Jackson in a somewhat adversarial role and a reportedly haunted room at the Dophin Hotel and you begin to anticipate a disturbing, heart pounding journey into the supernatural.

Unfortunately The film doesn't deliver as anticipated. Yes the production values are superb, the acting stellar (Cusack is amazing) and the storyline well developed and interesting. The problem is simple, the film simply lacks in the ""Fear Factor"" category which is obviously the most important aspect of any movie within the horror genre. There was no perceived acceleration of heartbeat, no increase in perspiration and no shutting of the eyes or turning away from the screen at any time. More importantly, there was no lingering uneasiness afterwards that would cause one to uncharacteristically peak into the closet or leave a night light on. All the things one would expect from a truly frightening film are mysteriously absent. Bottom line; good film, but not scary.

2906226,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Over the years Steven King has written some impressive books, with the protagonist being a writer. In his novels/films we have some examples of the following that illustrate this theme: The Shinning (1982), Misery (1993), and Secret Window (2005).

Director Mikael Hfstrm was nominated for an Oscar in Best Foreign Language Film in 2004, but most recently, he directed the American action thriller Derailed (2005). Now he is back with 1408, based on a Steven King's short story. We are going off the record to tell you horror fans that this is the best movie this year for this genre, not just because of the theme it presents--a psychological drama mixed with a ghost story--but of the performance of our leading actor John Cusack and supporting actor Samuel Jackson.

Story:
Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a non-fictional writer of the supernatural books. They involve the most popular haunted places throughout the United States and so he travels to disprove these occurrences. After staying at a so-called haunted Inn--where there are no ghosts--he leaves the next morning to pick up his mail and finds a post card. The card has a warning that tells him not to enter room 1408 at the Dolphin hotel in NYC. However, he accepts this as a challenge even though--once arriving there--the manager (Jackson) pleads with him and tells him that room has a history of evil involving 56 deaths and that no one has lasted more than an hour. Enslin does not seemed to be concerned by this and believes that the manager is just giving him a lot of supernatural hype--to get people to stay at his hotel.

In a short while and after his talk with him he ventures up to his room, he unlocks the door, and to his surprise, the room looks very normal. When the clock radio starts playing by itself and begins the one hour countdown, he is surprised and frightened by this occurrence. Will he survive the haunting of room 1408?

Review:
Our director Mikael Hfstrm, does a outstanding job of bringing to the big screen an old school theme of and horror and anxiety in which the viewer will get the impression that they are watching an old episode of the Twilight Zone or Outer limits. Because just like those vintage shows, our director focuses more on the acting and photography, rather than special effects that we have grown accustomed over recent years with this supernatural genre--like Thirteen Ghosts (2001) and White Noise (2005).

The photography is efficient throughout the duration of the film from the filters--8 mm visual appearance of the ghosts--to close-ups of Cusack showing his mental and physical appearance--goes from cool and calm to insane--and what works the best is that the photography gives us a very surrealistic manifestation of his environment. Most of the story takes place in this hotel room.

The ""Oscar worthy"" acting is what sells 1408 because of the range of emotions that we watch our main character experience. In the beginning of the film, he is cool, calm, as if a reporter would be covering a news story. However, as the film progresses we watch him turn from reality to uncertainty of his very existence as the room changes before his eyes, in which the effects give us a very theatrical style and very reminiscent of the Twilight Zone. What was also refreshing is the performance from Jackson. He portrays a very calm and sophisticated character rather than a loud mouth--of what we are accustomed to in so many of his acting roles.

You might be disappointed in the story not because they keep you guessing, but they do not fully explain his (Cusack) personal problems and this leaves you wondering how he looses his faith in his profession of being a non-fictional ghost writer.

The Verdict:
This is excellent supernatural horror movie that will keep you guessing to the end. The performances are exceptional from Cusack and Jackson--it is very refreshing when you see actors playing out of character and this usually equals Oscar nominations. The story was weak in part but over all one of the best movies since What lies Beneath (2000). Permission granted!",1192838400,4,4085,4.842406876790831
2906227,5,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is a wonderful addition to the horror/terror genre. King's original short story was interesting, but by King's own introduction, fairly commonplace. In the movie, director Mikael Hfstrm avoids all the clichs and Cusack pulls off the 'one actor, one room' story like no one else.

It's really not that scary a movie; rather it's a 'thinking man's' psychological sort of terror. Be prepared for some humor (black and otherwise), to be kept guessing and to want to rewind and freeze-frame many, many times.",1192492800,4,508,5.0476190476190474
2906228,3,B000TJ6PBU,"In 1408, we have with us an author of cheap scare books. Even though he thinks his profession is rather respectable, one always feels John Cusack is being bit of weasel towards the beginning. His overconfidence soon turns into resentment. There were maybe three scenes in the film that I found quite scary. I loved the helplessness his character is made to feel but I also hated it because it was a bit too much like a bad dream and after a while if you're watching this on DVD, you will feel like looking at your watch. I'd say it's a 6.5/10. Mr. Jackson has no role in the film, he's just on the cover.

The film's weakness lies in the fact that it had no answers to the problem it creates in itself. There was no moral conclusion it seemed to draw. It was meant to scare and bruise one's conscience but you definitely wouldn't think of this film unless asked to name one of the scariest films of the year, 2007. (Vacancy, you're next)

There haven't been many that have pleased me; just The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and Stand By Me (The Body). I was never a fan of The Shining, film wise. That is just a story that should never be messed with because it's impossible to capture half of what's in the novel. But I digress. 1408 did for me what The Shining couldn't. Maybe it was John Cusack's awesome performance while alone for most of the movie, or maybe it was the element of horror mixed with that of true emotion from a parent who's lost a child.

I'm not saying this film is perfect. Again I stress, IT'S A STEPHEN KING SHORT STORY. I'm simply saying that this movie is perfect to watch on Halloween, or any other time that you're in the mood to see John Cusack beating up his refrigerator because Samuel L.

Isn't that what it should be about? Much of the suspense is created by camera angles and the mere hopelessness of the situation.  You wonder what you would try in his shoes.  Jon Cusack's cynical main character is a pleasant alternative to ditsy dorks who usually accompany big-screen horror stories.  He walks into the same danger, not out of naivitee, rather because of his lack of faith in anything but himself.  It is what defines his role and makes the film interesting and entertaining on many levels.
If you want a good scare, watch this film.  Don't go comparing it to the short story, don't overinterpret into the character's background.  If you can suspend your disbelief to accept the supernatural for a short while, you have enough imagination to fill in what blanks are left in the characters' histories.

Where Kubrick utilized a snowbound resort hotel to ratchet dread and claustrophobia, here a mundane hotel room serves the same purpose.  There is a certain supernatural element to the room's objects but the biggest boogeyman in the room is the human psyche.  It was a stroke of genius to cast John Cusack as the room's intended victim.  Cusack is an understated actor who rarely gives in to histrionics.  If Cusack can go bonkers than something truly evil is afoot.

Once in room 1408 he undergoes many physcological thrills that may turn out to be a reality.

Another one when John Cusack dropped the bed lamp to the street from his 14th floor suite to see if he's hallucinating. The lamp hit the street without making any nose. Then it disappeared. Meanwhile, John could hear people talking and car honking from the street.

Most of  the other scenes have been done in other horror movies before. For example, the door automatically locked him up. He could not open it etc. The special effects look fake.

The worst thing about this story is that at the end it suggested all John Cussack experienced was caused by his imagination! It's because nobody else saw anything. The room was perfectly in tact after John was rescued. How scary it was!

This movie is worth renting not buying.

In the theatre, once things got rolling, there was never a moment's rest from the suspense and creeping horror.  And then, the constant wonder: was it really happening or was our friend finally just losing it for good?  I'm still not sure.

Not a bad movie, but certainly not a Horror film that will be remembered as great.

There are some good scares (that reminded me of that Tales From the Crypt episode that I mentioned earlier) in 1408. 1408 held my attention well enough, and John Cusack does a stand-up job at what is practically a solo performance all the way through (with brief {but always excellent} appearances by Samuel L. Jackson). But all in all, 1408 seemed like one of those Horror movies that I'd seen before...and I don't mean because I'd read the short story years ago...I mean because it just wasn't that original.

2906247,4,B000TJ6PBU,"This movie received mixed reviews from critics and star rankings here seem to be all over the place.  It may just come down to what you like.

Here we have a character-driven thriller of the highest order, in my humble opinion.  I like John Cusack anyway, but whether he's one of your favorites or not, there's no denying he really carries this film.  From self-assured (almost self-absorbed) debunker of haunted places to a man panicking under the onslaught of a hotel room out to get him, he puts in a stellar performance.

And so does the hotel suite itself.  It's so innocent and normal when he first steps in, you just know it's going to snap.  Things start off rather harmlessly but quickly escalate.  Cusack is so transparently in character that you simply watch him and forget who the actor is.  He jumps when startled with utter believability and stays within the bounds of his character throughout.  Waxing and waning between belief and denial, heartbreak and determination, he sucks you in and brings you along for the ride as this maniacal hotel room systematically breaks him down both psychologically and physically.

For a PG-13 rated film, there's no shortage of genuine scariness, creepiness, and excitement.  There's no gore, of course, but this isn't a slash 'em up horror flick, this is a terror thriller that draws you in to a character's plight.

Buy this two-disk version and you get the theatrical version plus a director's cut with an alternate ending.  For purists, the theatrical version is closer to Stephen King's original short story.  For those who haven't read it or don't expect movies to follow books to the letter, the alternate ending is just as satisfying, a little more challenging, and no worse for being different.  You can take your pick.

If you'd like to be sucked into one man's plight in a hotel room that's out to get him (in classic Stephen King style the evil is environmental instead of a creature of some sort), this is a GREAT movie.  The pace is fast but not frenetic, there are some marvelously creepy moments (my favorite being when he waves out the window to the building across the street), and, again, Cusack really shines.

They're either unintelligent gore fest like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" or teen breast shows like the ""Friday the 13th"" series. None have risen up to the benchmark of the originial ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The best new horror film I've seen lately is the ""Hitcher"" which does actually have some shock moments but nothing truly frightening. As for this film, I wanted to like it, I really did. I enjoy both of the lead actors (John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson) and they both do a great job with the script that they're given. Unfortunately, the script's not much. Basically, Cusack plays a disillusioned writer whose genre is supposedly haunted travel sights but does not believe in anything supernatural himself (obviously this is a jab at the ""new"" atheist movement of Dawkins and Harris). He receives a postcard about a hotel room in NYC where evryone who has stayed there dies and of course he must go there himself. From there, he meets hotelier Jackson who begs him not to entre the room and gives him the detailed account of its history. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, unfortunately, it only goes down hill from there. The special effects, which are supposed to be so creepy, simply strike one as cheesy and ho-hum. The end, which the dvd cover describes as ""leaving you gasping"", simply left me shrugging ""So what?"" Of course it would end that way. There are absolutely no surprises here.

The movie has some good jolts, and although it's script is sometimes muddled and the ending a little anticlimactic, 1408 is a good ghost story and Cusack dominates it with his performance.  In a non-horror genre, this performance would be generating Oscar buzz, but it's rare that the academy honors this type of film, although Cusack is that good!!",1191715200,4,1022,4.95906432748538
2906261,1,B000TJ6PBU,"Having a sincere interest in paranormal investigation myself, I thought this movie would definitely be a thrill ride.  It set up a premise that was sure to be a hit.  John Cusack plays a popular author name Michael Einslin who writes books about haunted places but still doesn't believe in ghosts.  He checks into room 1408 (or does he?) at The Dolphin Hotel, where the manager (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him not to because of the horrible unexplained deaths and suicides that have happened in that room.  Let the chill bumps begin!

The typical ""bumps in the night"" soon begin once he enters the room. The bed is mysteriously turned down and there's a chocolate on the pillow.  The clock radio comes on by itself with Karen Carpenter singing.  The thermostat won't turn down.  John's character treats us to narration as he records his thoughts on a tape recorder.  It all falls apart at this point.

Michael panics when an open window slams shut on his hand.  A man in a window in an adjacent building mimics Michael's moves like a mirror and is then killed.  The key breaks off in the door when he tries to escape.  Ghosts that looked like something out of The Frighteners appear in the room and jump out the window.  Karen Carpenter starts playing again even with the clock radio unplugged.  Michael climbs out the window attempting to go to the window of the next room, but there is no window.  A crazy man keeps appearing and tries to attack him.  The pages of the Bible in the room go blank. By now, any paranormal investigation is off and things just get silly.

A never ending bottle of cognac seems to fuel Michael's hallucinations, if he is hallucinating.  He climbs in the air vents to escape and looks down through the vents only to see snapshots from his past involving his wife, and his daughter who is dying, and a bumbling relationship with his father.  Some dead guy in the vent chases him back to the room, who looks oddly like Bill Murry's boss in Scrooged.  I found myself laughing at this whole charade rather than being scared.

It rains in the rooms (sprinklers).  It snows (the thermostat is at -5).  And the boring paintings on the wall go mad.  Michael attempts to contact his estranged wife via his laptop.  Suddenly, it's all a bad dream and Michael is in the hospital, after having washed up on the beach from hitting his head on a surf board.  I myself was anxious for the dreary madness to be over too.

One good part of the movie, in typical Stephen King fashion, is that Michael soon discovers that waking up in the hospital was just a dream too.  He's back in the room and going mad again.  Unfortunately, the viewer is only treated to tidbits of information about Michael's depression over his dead daughter, his sour marriage, and what's left of his crazy father.  You'll be just as confused as Michael is in this room.

The best parts of the movie are merely blinks on the screen.  A mysterious girl at a book signing asks Michael about a book he wrote a long time ago, something about a relationship between a father and son.  Even the hotel manager mentions this book, but that's the end of it.  Michael's narration into the tape recorder is witty and definitely a good story as he explains the room.  When he is actually investigating in the beginning, he washes the room with a black light and discovers blood everywhere.  Flashes of the dead bodies appear as he crosses each blood spatter.  These are the ominous effects that you really enjoy, but they all get left behind, and there aren't very many of them anyway.

Sometimes King just doesn't translate very well to the big screen sometimes.  Getting into the heads of his characters should be left to the written word. Cusack gives a good performance and is just the victim of a bad over-the-top script.  Samuel L. Jackson is just Samuel L. Jackson, he even works in his trademark F word.  Save this movie for a boring Sunday.  It won't cure the boredom, but it will kill an hour or two.",1191715200,13,3981,4.540084388185654
2906262,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Nowadays it seems horror movies are either too tame to even be scary- and you're just eventually bored, or they are just filled with so much gore you are not scared- but just disgusted. I have grown bitter with horror films these days, but still hold on to hope at least once a year there will be one good one that comes out, which usually there is. 1408 is indeed, for me, this years one.

It's not like it is without flaws, but the strengths in the film outweigh them. Cusack, for one, I think did just a great job with his role. Jackson was not in the movie too much so I guess he did fine with the little time he was on. The pacing and build up throughout the film I agree with the majority on, very well done. King always had a great way of building up suspense and he does not fail in this story either. He also does not fail to tug on the heartstrings as we eventually figure out why Enslin is the way he is- bitter, detached, etc.

What I love most though is the lack of gore. I am not saying there should be none, but nowadays we are so incredibly filled to the brim with gore from so many other horror films, that watching one that really cuts back is just so refreshing. And also 1408 proves you do not need massive amounts of gore to have a movie creep you out. It's really a solid thriller throughout that at least kept me watching till the end.

The only real problem I had in the film were the special effects. They were good enough, but I was expecting the effects to be a bit more impressive than they were. Also overall, after being a King fan for a long time, I have to admit 1408 does not measure up quite where many of King's other more heavyweight stories in the past did. Nonetheless, this is actually only a short story by King, and it really has made a successful step to film.

I highly recommend this for a good, old- fashioned scare. King does not disappoint.

2906263,5,B000TJ6PBU,"I approached 1408 with low expectations. I think the short story is probably the scariest thing King has ever written, and the definitive haunted room story. I've been hoping for years that somebody would do a film adaptation, but King is notoriously difficult to adapt to film. Moreover, I don't remember hearing anything about a theatrical release, and the first I heard of it was a TV ad for the DVD. Worse, there were scenes in the TV trailer that I knew were not in the story, so clearly the short story had been expanded for the screen--usually bad news with a King story (Children of the Corn, anyone?).

To my great delight, the film fully does justice to the short story, and is probably the best Stephen King adaptation since The Shining. The additions and elaborations are fully in spirit of the original. There are a couple of things from the story missing, but they are things that would have been difficult to convey on film.

John Cusak turns in a tour de force performance, most of it solo, as the jaded writer of occult travelogues who tries to spend the night in the evil room 1408. Samuel Jackson is also excellent as the hotel manager, in a scene that is almost verbatim from the book, and prime Steven King. The ending is perhaps more benign than in the original story, but it works, and there are a couple of alternative endings on the disk if it doesn't suit.",1191628800,2,1382,4.524
2906264,1,B000TJ6PBU,I enjoy both these actors most of the time so I bought this DVD without watching it in the theater or knowing anything about the plot.  I was bored from the get go... I didn't even finish watching the movie.  I thought it was terrible and boring.  No wonder it wasn't in the theaters that long.  I should have known better.,1191542400,7,323,4.245901639344262
2906265,5,B000TJ6PBU,"It is extremely refreshing to finally see a ""true"" horror movie that doesn't go for shock value.  All of the horror movies that come out now only deal with a lot of blood, guts and torturing.  Not knocking that type of movies, but it gets tiring when it's the same thing over and over again.  With ""1408,"" you are given a truly creepy movie that gets into your head, as well as in your soul.  The premise at a glance seems simple and even risks being overly ridiculous if not handled with the greatest of care.

Mike Enslin is a writer who likes to take his accounts of so-called ""haunted"" areas and sell them to the public in his books, however if you really know the man you know that he really doesn't believe in anything.  Still, there is something that drives him to go to each place that claims to be haunted to see if he can have some sort of proof that there is something more to what we simply see everyday.  He gets a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel and on the back it warns him specifically not to go into Room 1408.  Of course, this makes Mike all the more curious, so he sets his sight onto the room.  Not even the manager of the hotel can steer him away with his warnings, as Mike himself says to the manager that he doesn't believe in ghosts or monsters, and even if they did exist that there was no God to protect them from such horrors.  The manager allows Mike to stay in the room after seeing there is no way to tell him otherwise.  What Mike will witness during his stay is the things that nightmares are made of, and it will dish out every single fear he has ever had along with forcing him to revisit a horrible personal tragedy and get to the very bottom of his soul.

""1408"" not only is a well-made horror movie, but it's also an excellent film over all.  This is a movie that goes to places that a lot of the new horror movies don't go.  The movie is not afraid to get personal and deep while still giving you great scares.  There are times that you may find yourself jumping here and there, but the scare factor is mostly psychological and it'll make you feel uncomfortable in your seat.  You don't have to scream aloud to be frightened.  It's a scream that you keep inside of yourself and take with you when you go to bed, and it lingers in your head no matter how many times you try to shake it off.

There are two things that make this movie a success; 1) John Cusack is phenomenal, and dare I say this might be one of his best performances ever, and that is nothing easy considering the fact that he's solo in 90% of the movie.  He has great range as an actor, and this movie showcases all of his emotions and you really feel for him and grow to love him.  2) The emotional human side of the film that's very realistic.  Even though it's been said in reviews and the trailer, I don't want to give it away.  You'll understand when you watch the movie.  These are the two important factors that make the movie work and keep it from being a ""goofy horror"" flick.

The 2-Disc ""Collector's Edition"" contains some behind the scenes features, both the theatrical and an ""Extended Director's Cut"" and commentary on the ""Director's Cut"" version of the film.  I've seen both and I personally prefer the theatrical cut, but it was interesting to see the other version.  In fact, the director, as much as he loves some of the extended scenes and the ""alternate ending"" that's featured in the ""Director's Cut,"" admits to being very happy with the theatrical version and understanding why some things were better left out or changed (this found on the commentary track with him and the writers).  The ending in the other version is very different from the theatrical, but again I have to say I prefer the version I originally saw the first time.  If you go with the 2-Disc edition, you can view for yourself and see which one you like better.

""1408"" is one of the few new horror movies that really made an impact on me, and it's a trip worth taking.  It's not one that everyone will like, and some people may not be able to handle some of the dark and depressing themes that the movie ventures into, but if you're sick of the torture flicks and want to see a genuinely creepy movie that'll stay with you, then I highly recommend checking it out.  Definitely goes down as one of my favorite movies of the year. -Michael Crane",1191542400,17,4341,4.315659679408138
2906266,4,B000TJ6PBU,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, just because the premise seemed like it would make it unavoidably corny.  It's actually pretty entertaining and keeps you engaged throut. Even though you know bad stuff is going to happen to Cusaks character the minute he checks into room 1408, the suspense and buildup works suprisingly well, although you have to figure that in real life, a person might've tried doing what Cusak ultimately did  much earlier, but then you wouldn't have a movie, would you? lol ...You also sorta have to suspend any and all plausible motives that Samuel L. Jacksons character may or may not have....so don't ask yourself  'would a hotel manager do what he did'? I never quite figured out his MO, but his role is not too far above a cameo anyway and not really paramount to the story. What did seem too Hollywood , was weaving something from the main characters past into the story , in this case Cusaks dead daughter, which the room somehow knew about and proceeded to use to turn the psychological screws on Cusaks gradual dementia.

What a stinker of a movie. It felt like a Disney version of a haunted house film. Don't get me wrong, the lack of gore was not the problem here. The problem was everything else that WAS on screen except Cusack. There is a quote on the DVD box from the reviewer at Maxim saying this film ranks with ""The Shining"". He must've seen the 90's remake. This movie is not even close to anything achieved in Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Samuel Jackson was only in this movie for literally one scene, and it wasn't that great. If you want to see a Stephen King film adaptation about a writer trapped in a building, that's actually entertaining, watch ""Misery"" or ""The Shining"" and you'll be much happier.",1191456000,15,855,4.66887417218543
2906278,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Based on Stephen King's short horror story, ""1408"" keeps us guessing whether the horror lives in the room or in the mind of its aggrieved, alcoholic protagonist. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a novelist whose creative energies have seen better days. Now he churns out guidebooks to purportedly haunted locales and tours the country in search of paranormal activity that he never finds. Mike wants to investigate Room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. But the hotel's manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) does everything he can to dissuade Mike from entering the room, where 56 guests have died in the hotel's 95-year history. Mike scoffs at the claim that no one lasts more than an hour, and insists on spending the night in Room 1408.

We spend that hour with Mike in real time. The build-up to the hour of horrors introduces us to Mike's state of mind, to the legend of Room 1408, and to the imposing, intriguing hotel manager Olin. Mike's conversation with Olin is a lot of fun before we enter the maelstrom. The action in the Room runs out of steam after a while, but it recovers and succeeds largely because we're never quite sure what the source of Mike's ordeal is. At times, I thought ""1408"" was no more than a minor reworking of ""The Shining"", but the film doesn't linger long on any one rationalization. I can't say that I was scared, but I was entertained by Mike's cynicism, Olin's frankness, and that Room that forces its occupants to confront -and perish by- their own demons.

2906285,4,B000TJ6PBU,"One of my friends is a huge fan of the recent onslaught of horror films: namely those that center on gore (Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel) or those that center on 10 jump scenes meant to scare you out of your seat but really show the story didn't have bite in the first place and needed those jumps. But as bad as he's been getting, Stephen King can come up with a few effective books which turn out to be either really great (The Shining, The Green Mile), manageable (The Langoliers) or just simply awful (Dreamcatcher). 1408 may not be the best adaptation of one of his films but it's certainly the best in awhile.

Michael Enslin is a writer who specializes in the most haunted places in America. Well at least if they were actually haunted since a lot of them have been disappointing and he's been growing increasingly cynical. But a curious postcard about the Dolphin Hotel in New York with the phrase ""Don't Enter 1408"" appears. This sparks his interest and despite the continued warnings from the hotel manager,Gerald Olin, he checks in. What initially begins as disbelief soon grows into a fear that the room may in fact be real.

A lot of horror movies are based on the idea that you're not safe as long as the film's on and with good use of atmosphere and tension, the film just might make you lose sleep. However, films lately are built around the idea that seeing entrails and ""chunky goodness"" is meant to scare you. Well it doesn't, it disgusts so it's with welcome that 1408 doesn't follow this route. Well there's only so much scary stuff to go around but it's a good use of letting the viewer feel uneasy. It also helps that we never leave the main character to sort of deflate everything which is a big plus.

But that means that main character better be awesome right? Well how can you expect less from John Cusack, one of the more reliable actors right now. He's always been great and here he shines as well, showing the cynicism, shock and tortured past that the character has without it feeling hammy or ""actor""-ish. The other main character is obviously Samuel L. Jackson (since he's on the cover, naturally) and Sam's always good but here he doesn't have much to do except for telling us how evil the room is. We also have Mary McCormack and Tony Shalhoub with only Mary being anything close to a full character.

With the Mist coming from Green Mile director and Cell from Hostel director Eli Roth (ugh) coming, it seems either people are seeing how effective a Stephen King story can be under a good director it's just simply the thing to do lately but luckily 1408 is as good a horror film out this year as any.",1191283200,3,2655,4.5020746887966805

2906299,4,B000TJ6PBU,"Unlike myself, writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) hates hotel rooms.

Enslin's distaste, however, is quite understandable. The man makes his living travelling back-and-forth across America, dubunking hotels with reputations for being haunted. So far, Enslin has never encountered anything more spooky in a room other than creaky floorboards or over-eager owners hoping to get a mention in one of his books. Thus it is only natural for him to be quite skeptical of the warnings from the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) about Room 1408. It seems that within the last hundred years over 50 people had died horrific deaths in that room. And, ever since one of the housekeepers gouged out her own eyes while alone in that room , not even hotel staff will work in there unless it is in pairs, at 10 minute intervals, keeping the door open at all times. As Olin puts it (delivered in classic Samuel L. Jackson style), ""Nobody has said anything about a ghost. I'm telling you it's just an evil motherf***ing room.""

Enslin is too cynical a man to take any of this seriously (and we do have a horror movie to watch). But within minutes of entering 1408, when the bedside alarm clock begins playing the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun,"" and then proceeds to set itself into countdown mode for one hour, Enslin is beginning to think he finally just might have stumbled onto the real thing. Unfortunately and sadly for him.

1408 is a horror film in the classic genre. A supernatural force of pure Evil undeniably possesses this room. Whatever -literally- is at play here, tears into Enslin's mind, finding his losses and regrets, and his own self-loathing to relentlessly attack him both physically and psychologically.

2906301,5,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is one of the best film adaptations of a Stephen King story, and is highly atmospheric. I too am growing weary of movies masquerading themselves as horror films these days, when all they offer are ludicruous plot lines and excess gore, violence and gratuituous sex.

By comparison, 1408 exceeds all expectations when taken for what it is - an intelligent horror movie that despite being rated a tame PG-13 delivers chills, thrills, and a strong performance by its lead actor, John Cusack, as well as a good supporting role by Samuel L Jackson. The story centers around a jaded author, Mike Enslin [John Cusack] who pens 'true horror' books but is actually a skeptic who doesn't believe in the afterworld or entities associated with it. He receives a cryptic postcard one day that tells him 'Do Not Enter 1408' -being a room in the Dolphin Hotel in NY, where Enslin has left behind a painful past.

The rest of the movie picks up pace very quickly and viewers are in for a thrill ride as Enslin manages to overcome the protestations of the hotel manager [Samuel Jackson] and spends the night in 1408, which has one of the grisliest & bloody reputations in the annals of hotel history. Enslin finds his skepticism melting in the face of the unbelievable horrors he faces in 1408, and struggles to keep his wits about him to survive.

The horror in this movie is very palpable - there is no gore or excess violence, but there's a pervasive sense of menace and evil that sends chills down one's spine, and a couple of jump-out-your-seat moments[not to mention a couple of plot twists]. But what truly lifts this movie is the strong & riveting performance by John Cusack. The whole movie basically revolves around him and it is amazing to watch an actor bring so much depth to his role as well as portray a feeling of alienation, isolation and paranoia as Enslin tries to face his fears in 1408.

I am a fan of atmospheric horror movies, and 1408 ranks as one of my favorite horror movies [ The Haunting, Changeling, Rosemary's Baby, The Shining being some of my other favs]. If you're a fan of the horror genre, or simply a fan of psychological drama & thrillers, then 1408 should please you.",1189036800,249,2193,4.615384615384615
2906302,5,B000TJ6PBU,"To say the film ""1408"" is good is an understatment. To say it is one of the best horror films of the 2000s is more like it. Seriously, this film gets so many things right it blew my mind. I'm sitting in the theater, and I have an experience that I usually never get in a theater: I am creeped out of my wits. The film succeeds on neary every level: casting, direction, pace, production values (despite some corny CGI), acting, script, tone - everything about it is so well-done that any flaws can be easily overlooked.

Mike Enslin is a writer who has thrown his considerable talent away for cheap non-fiction ghost tales that rarely get read. His newest book, ""Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Hotels,"" is near completion. He receives a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel with a single anonymous message written on the back:

""Don't enter 1408.""

Seeing this as a challenge, Enslin proceeds. After getting into a very entertaining argument over his right to stay in 1408 with the hotel manager, he finally gets in. Although he was previously told there's been over fifty deaths in the room, he's not phased. At least, until, his alarm clock erupts with the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."" And then we know we're in for one thrilling, amazingly entertaining ride.

I must say, I'm like any film fan who believes the term ""horror film"" is frowned upon by society. All we've gotten are horrendously awful remakes of old classics and disgustingly sadistic torture/gore films. None of it is scary. It's just repulsive cinema. So imagine my surprise when I'm sitting there, watching ""1408,"" and I'm creeped out! Apart from that, it can actually be called a horror film. And it's rated PG-13, I might add. And it's creepier than anything I've seen for a long, long time. If anyone tells you good horror is strictly in R-rated territory, tell them to watch this.

John Cusack is brilliant. Had he not been cast as Mike Enslin, this film would have been a disaster. Because, basically, he's in almost every frame of the film; when that happens, you'd better have a good lead actor to carry you through the story; any lesser actor woulkd have failed. Cusack more than meets the challenge. This film is proof he's a very underrated actor and deserves more recognition. There's so much in the story to work with that you can tell he had a blast doing the film.

CAUTION: Spoilers here

Visually, the film comes through in spades. Room 1408 is anything but scary on first sight, just a normal hotel room. Then the room itself becomes a personal hell, driving poor Mike insane. This where the visuals take off; and some of them are wild! For example, Mike tries signaling for help across the street to another building. The man in the other building begins to wave frantically, as if he sees him. But suddenly, Mike realizes: the man is just a mirror image of himself. Also toward the end, we see a painting of a ship at sea, and all of a sudden, it comes to life, complete with waves and lightning. So many cool things happen to Mike from the evil room; and it's usually stuff you wouldn't expect to be creepy. But boy howdy, it is. I'd say ""1408"" is the best Stephen King adaptation since ""The Green Mile"" (1999).

If you are a fan of great horror, this is the film to see. Ignore any other torture remake pig slop and enter 1408.",1188777600,17,3313,4.565656565656566
2906303,4,B000TJ6PBU,"This movie was made from a short story by Stephen King, 1408 is like a minibar version of Stanley Kubrick's take on The Shining: everything that made that film great has been reduced here into something smaller in scale that's easier to consume but significantly less satisfying. Another film about a writer being driven insane by an evil hotel, it offers a refreshing stop-over for horror fans seeking a rest from the torture porn excesses of Saw and Hostel, yet boasts none of the complexity, the intellectual nourishment or the intense creepiness of Kubrick's thematically similar horror masterpiece.
What it does have in its favour is John Cusack.
He plays Mike Enslin, a failed novelist who has managed to make a living debunking the presence of ghosts, ghouls and poltergeists in a series of bestselling guidebooks to America's most haunted hotels. His usual trick is to travel to some roadside motel where he'll be eagerly greeted by proprietors ready to regale him with tales of grizzly suicides and malign spirits haunting the rooms. He then tries to settle in for a good night's sleep, after making some effort towards, if not quite professionalism, then at least taking the job half-seriously.
This all changes when he receives an anonymous postcard imploring him not to enter room 1408 in Manhattan's upscale Dolphin hotel. His interest suitably piqued, he calls up to reserve the room, only to be told it's unavailable - at all times. With the aid of his publisher's legal team, however, he manages to secure a reservation and flies from his home in California to check in, only to be greeted by the hotel's creepily officious manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), who pleads with him to take an alternative suite.
His reasoning is simple---Four people have died horrible deaths under his watch and, in its 95-year existence, a litany of people have lost their lives by torturous means. Nevertheless, Mike is determined to check in and, sensing he's fighting a losing battle, Olin allows him to do so, ominously leaving him at the room's door to face a whole host of personal demons and malevolent spirits.
Once he's shut off and isolated in the room, Cusack is also the kind of actor you don't mind spending the majority of a movie with, and he's great when Mike's cynicism gives way to disbelief and outright terror. The film has a few neat touches, too--I won`t give then away....
It's too bad the film eventually goes overboard with CGI effects, but heck it kept me interested for a couple of hours.",1188691200,,2519,4.8604651162790695
2906304,3,B000TJ6PBU,"I know what your saying, ""This DVD isn't out yet""  Well, your right.  Living in NY and having access to the right sources, I stumbled upon this  Stephen King based movie. *Quick Shout to the source who gave me this sweet copy*  With a movies such as Pet Semetary I and II, Children of The Corn II-IV, Dreamcatcher, and Firestarter 2, lets just say Stephen King doesn't have a great track record when it comes to movies (Green Mile and The Shining are a few exceptions).  1408, however could join those exceptions....

Plot: When Mike Enslin's (John Cusack) daugher died, Enslin became obsessed with the paranormal and ""other side.""  After years of being a paranormal investagtor and writer, he hasn't made contact with any one or any thing.  Until one day, he hears about the Dolphin Hotel and room 1408.  He decides to stay in the room, even against the wishes of Hotel Manager Mr. Olin (Sam L. Jackson).  Mr. Enslin wants to see if 1408 is as haunted as Mr. Olin is leading on...

Synopsis: 1408 is a well written and acted movie.  Rather force feed the audience gore and blood like Saw or Hostel, they get under your skin from a psychological approach. 1408 never gets explained, it is a room where your personal demons come to the forefront and you have to confront them.  Instead of dealing with a Jason or Michael Myers, Enslin has to deal with his mind and images that try to confuse him.  All while trying to keep his sanity.

John Cusack shines in this movie, his character is a believable guy.  For him to hold your focus while in a room for an hour, he has to be doing something right.  On the other hand, Samuel L. Jackson is a waste of character.  Anyone could have played that role and told Enslin to stay out the room.

Final Analysis:  While not a bad movie, 1408 isn't that good.  I would have to place it in between his great (The Shining) and terrible(Rosy Red) movies, some where next to Thinner. Granted it is only an hour and a half, but some type of background for the room or even getting to know Mr. Olin more, would have help the story.  There are certain movies, that a director wants the audience to come up with their own ending, and this is one of those movies.  If I wasn't in the pleasure of my house, I would have thrown my pretzels at the TV screen.  Thanks to a weak ending and too many loop holes, I have to give this movie....

2906305,4,B000TJ6PBU,"1408 is a great story but don't expect to much horror. Its John Cusack's performance is amazing and its a great look at how people can go mad. Samuel L Jackson has a great part but its a bit part. The movie starts basically with a few little giggles but don't expect to much horror. Its about a man dealing with the lose of his child. I thought the ending was cheap but alas, it wasn't the ending. Id highly recommend this movie. The real ending brought chills up my spine and that is something that never happens.",1187568000,2,514,4.255102040816326
2906306,5,B000TJ6PBU,"Surely the best horror movie that I have seen for a long time. A magnificent one-man-show by Cusack. Yes, Jackson is also there, in a good small part. Everybody else is secondary. Of course apart from the hotel room.
Cusack is a possibly talented (how would we know?) young writer who wastes his talent with trashy non-fiction about haunted places. You see where this leads, but it is so far above expectations. Of course he also has his private tragedy in his bio, which of course plays an important part in the story.
A question for literary research: is there a relation between King's story and Murakami's novel about the Wild Sheep Chase? Who is quoting whom with the odd Hotel Dolphin? Of course King's hotel goes quite a few steps further than Murakami's. On the other hand, the time warp with the surf board is straight out of a Murakami novel. Not to forget it is also a quote from Ambrose Bierce.
Marvellous stuff for unserious people who hate bad workmanship. There is none here.",1187395200,7,990,4.630681818181818
2906307,5,B000TJ6PBU,"I watched this film in the theater last week and having read the brilliant short story (in Everythings Eventual) I knew this could either make a bad or good movie. When it was done, I loved it. The film stayed faithful to the short story and it rocked. I really liked the casting with very good actors like John Cusack (who was the sole performer for most of the film) and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects were most convincing. To be honest, I liked the ending in the film better. I've been hearing in a few places that Stephen King recommends the film and I do to. This film washes away the shameful crap houses like Saw and Hostel and restores good supernatural horror to its place. Lastly I recommend both the book Everythings Eventual (it contains the short story) and this film (which I believe I like better).",1183852800,5,821,4.48
