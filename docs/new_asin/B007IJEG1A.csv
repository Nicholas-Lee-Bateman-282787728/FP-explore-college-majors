8517577,4,B007IJEG1A,"Great drama about forensics intertwined with the usual power politics; it was filled with treachery, revenge and betrayal.  However, giving one's life in order to reveal the truth of a deceased is not an option.  Doing your best is what counts; the truth will prevail eventually.",1509321600,,279,5.043478260869565
8517578,4,B007IJEG1A,"Although the characters start out a bit stilted, they soon hit their stride and do a wonderful job in this series.  The cases and resulting forensic work is interesting and intense, but the writers wisely added some comedic moments to lighten things up a bit.  There are some very suspenseful scenes and some violent scenes.  I wouldn't think this would be appropriate for kids under the age of 15.  In the U.S.  this would probably be rated PG- 13 for the the violence and the mature themes.  Language and sensuality are very mild in this series.",1366416000,2,547,4.645833333333333
