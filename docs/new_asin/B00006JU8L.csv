1782524,5,B00006JU8L,"Princesa definitely shows the difference between the open sexual attitudes of Italian people and those of the more parochial and puritanical American people. Most Americans will hate this movie because it goes against the homo-erotic grain. There's a good reason why it was filmed with sub-titles: It would have bombed in an American release except in the most intellectual of audiences and it was only shown on the Sundance channel.

It's a fabulous weaving of character and explains the interconnection of a transgender's life. Even a gay or lesbian would fail to understand what it means to be transgender so don't even try; just watch and accept that this is what it is.

Whoever wrote this script definitely either knew a transgender person or was transgender because they hit the nail right on the head. The director must have also had someone who was transgender looking over his shoulder and suggesting nuance because the detail is astonishing.

It isn't a spectacular life being a hooker. I was a cabbie for a few years in Virginia and I hauled my fair share of transgender hookers to-and-from their nightly hot-spots. It offered me the opportunity to talk with them and ask all the right questions. Many of their ""Johns"" were Navy guys who hated gay men but wouldn't hesitate to bed a ""chick with a d**k"". Odd that heterosexuals would find such a distinction but they do.

The major difference between American guys and Gianni in the movie is that Americans can't get over their homophobia long enough to realize that they might love someone who was born with the same equipment.

In the end, though, Fernanda proves the more mature of the two of them. Feature that: A woman who out-matures a man. Hard to imagine, huh?

If you have the intellect and the patience for the subtitles, trust me and watch this movie. You won't regret it. It will be the best two hours you can spend and the best purchase you can make for a well-rounded international library!",1293148800,12,1965,4.781710914454277
1782525,4,B00006JU8L,"I am honest: I viewed the film primarily for a conference project and I am working with the topic. My approach to the film hence was not impartial. Nonetheless, I think I can say with enough 'cold blood' that the film deserves way more credit than it has publicly achieved. Based on the memoirs of the real transgender woman Fernanda Farias de Albuquerque, Ingrid de Souza plays her role of Fernanda Farias, coming to Milan as a sex worker, to earn enough money for her sex reassingment (I prefer the term 'sex - reaffirmation') surgery. She sees the street as a passage in her life she wantsto get rid of as soon as possible, and when she finally falls in love with the successful lawyer Gianni, who leaves his wife for Fernanda and moves in with her, she sees her dreams come true. In a series of shots, director Henrique Goldman shows how paradise soon turns into hell - but not because of maltreatment on behalf of Gianni. Quite the opposite, Gianni is as caring as a partner can be - if only Fernanda did not find herself pushed into the traditionalied roles of the nourishing housewife. When Gianni's wife Livia shows up, telling that she is pregnant from him, Fernanda painfully realizes what she will never be able to become - and returns to the streets.

The film - in a sometimes more than explicit language - shows the two most painful labellings for transwomen: either they are perceived as sex-workers, or as wanting to stick my any means to excessively traditionalist roles of a housewife and mother - and the latter is simply not doable for transwomen, if we take the term of a mother biologically. The film shows how Fernanda gets caught up in stereotyped discurse fields - and how there is no getting out of them.

Goldman manages to create an impressive insight into the life of a transwoman who actually wants what anyone else wants: being loved and taken care of. Goldman's views are pessimistic, but he does not portray Fernanda solely as the victim. Clearly, the pictures Goldman uses are stereotyped, sometimes in a manner which is grotesque and reminds more a farce rather than a drama - but at the same time it is also a view on transgender issues remote from the TV-world, which all to often promises success stories in a make-believe.",1256601600,4,2261,4.635910224438903
1782526,3,B00006JU8L,"This movie dares to humanize transgender prostitutes and succeeds by reaffirming that ""Everybody's Got The Right To Love"" (The Supremes, 1970).  A good old-fashioned love story with a twist. Nice train and Milan railroad station shots.",1234569600,,235,5.527777777777778
1782527,1,B00006JU8L,"This movie portays a pathetic character, fitting the stereotypical tranny prostitute who has absolutely no self respect for herself.

Here's the synopsis:
 She comes to the city to work as a prostitute (having to first give in to advances from a customs official when her passport doesn't quite pass ""him"" off for a her). While working the streets for a pimp madam,(somehow) she falls in ""love"" with a john who kicks her out of his car when learning of her true gender, tries to get a ""normal life"" with the guy (who is married by the way) and once that all implodes, she happily goes back to the joyous world of working the streets for the madam again. The End.

  It will leave you scratching your head and mourning the time you wasted watching this. NOT worth it.",1231718400,3,766,4.521739130434782
1782528,5,B00006JU8L,"If you liked 'The Crying Game' you'll probably like this. Not that they deal with similar material, but the sense of a seedy paralell world existing next to the one most of us inhabit is there. Cesare Bocci is fine as hell. I wish he were in more films. Ingrid de Souza is a beautiful and sympathetic character but you get frustrated with her choice at the end. Overall, definately worth adding to your dvd collection.",1096761600,10,418,4.5131578947368425
1782529,5,B00006JU8L,"PRINCESA is an Italian film that hints of Fellini's best movies and yet has a style that is less bravure and more sensitive and touching.  The world of prostitution has been widely examined by writers and directors, but the world of prostitution where the main characters are all transexuals or transvestites has only been sugggested in the works of Almodovar and a few other daring avant garde directors.  PRINCESA (the street name of the main character, a young man from Brazil who moves to Milan to make enough money as a hooker to pay for his much desired gender change operation) takes on only the subject of how these extravagantly dressed prostitutes survive the street life that supports them.  There are friends of Princesa who are also from Brazil and the dialog is in both Italin and Portugese and well transtlated in subtitles.  The story is simple: Princesa falls in love with a 'john' who at first rejects her when he discovers she has male genitalia even though her face and breast implants costume her as a beautiful woman. The rejected Princesa moves in with the Madame of the prostitutes (Karin - likewise a transexual) and finds support and caring and a good life.  When Princesa's 'john' (Gianni) returns to apologize for his initial behavior, they slowly develop a relationship, fall in love, and the rest ....you must see the film to discover.
The characters are so beautifully acted that it is difficult to tell if the actors are male or female!  The cast is strong, never creating parodies but instead allowing the inner person to emarge in a credible way.  The photography and music score are excellent.  A very fine litlle movie this!",1035158400,38,1660,4.820422535211268

1782537,4,B00006JU8L,"This film will likely not win any big awards but the acting and the sincerity it holds provides a meaningful script.  Ingrid de Souza does a remarkable job in her role as Fernanda.  You can instantly sense the strain and emotion she is feeling within each decision she makes.  The subject isn't for everyone so if you're unable to watch with an open mind, then the film isn't worth your time.  It was a film that kept my interest and provided some intriguing moments.",1391990400,,467,4.523809523809524
1782538,4,B00006JU8L,Interesting and thought provoking. The star is very beautiful and a natural actress! A very non-judgmental depiction of a different type of love story. I really liked it!,1390953600,,170,5.107142857142857
1782539,3,B00006JU8L,Well done. Thought provocking and interesting story. Authentic and raw acting .  Unexpected finale that leaves the audience wishing more for Princesa.,1390348800,,150,5.818181818181818

1782541,5,B00006JU8L,"This is a very moving story, though not for the closed-minded person who is offended by sexually suggestive scenes or the storyline, which is about a transsexual.  In a way it seemed tragic, but very powerful in that this young woman comprehended much about herself through her experiences, and put herself where she felt her power the most in the end. I would not say that her choice of professions degraded her so much as it taught her about who she was as a person.",1389484800,,468,4.5058823529411764
1782542,3,B00006JU8L,"Good. Then it gets very raunchy and dramatic.  I like this movie because of the potential it was tetering in. I would have liked more clean shots and less grainy images.
The story is executed fine. The ending is what is most depressing. I wanted an alternate outcome. But regardless good film.",1389484800,,293,4.634615384615385
1782543,4,B00006JU8L,"I recommend this movie, it gives  viewer a realistic few of the life and dreams of a person wanting to live a ""normal"" life,",1389225600,,124,4.166666666666667
1782544,4,B00006JU8L,"Interesting portrait of a Brazilian transexual who dreams of a life as a ""normal"" woman with a loving man. The movie challenges the audience not only on the expected stereotypes regarding transsexuality but also about the meaning of being a ""normal"" woman. Without spoiling too much about the movie plot and ending, the character finds out that surgery is not the ultimate decision, it is an illusion toward the idea of becoming a woman.

On the downside, this movie is a bit a collection of old stereotype of Italian culture. It is set in the early 2000s but at times it reminds me of some settings of the neorealism Italian movement of the early 1960s, like Antonioni's or even Fellini's ""La dolce vita"". In this sense, the deep societal impacts of immigration in souther Europe are plainly ignored and cast - quite simplistically - in a sexual overtone.",1388534400,,856,4.783783783783784

Princessa is trying to make a better life for herself in a world that really doesn't care about her at all and throughout shows a certain grace and acceptance of herself that makes her just riveting to watch.",1355011200,,364,4.260869565217392

7970724,5,B00006JU8L,"This movie was very unique because it delved into a different side of the transgender struggle that is not shown.
This struggle is prostitution due to the lack of employment opportunities that transgender people face in Italy.
I found this movie a must to gain a better awareness of  the dangers that  transgenders face in society.
These were shown in the movie with people taking advantage,  like the police officer or the commuter in the movie who wanted to be with ""Princesa"".

I sympathized with ""Princesa"" because she wanted to find true love, and someone to respect her for who she is.
This movie conveys a unversal message of ""Love"" and 'Acceptance"".",1406678400,,657,4.839285714285714
7970725,1,B00006JU8L,Terrible.... Slow... Not in English... Don't waste your tone... Turned off after only a short time. Poor quality foreign film....,1398556800,,129,5.5
7970726,4,B00006JU8L,"After having recently seen a more contemporary film, K-11, that takes risks (and fails) at telling a story which respects the transgender experience, I decided to delve further into the genre and find a piece which works a lot better.

The first thing you should know about this film is that it's an actual trans actress portraying a trans character (based on a true story, actually).  That's a major positive.  There should be more films which do this.

Many other reviews delve into the plot of the story.  You can read those.  What I will say is that there are no huge surprises in how the plot unfolds or concludes.

Why I give the film four stars is because of the very strong performances of the supporting characters.  They really give the film life and dimension.  Pay attention for the HIV subplot - a necessary part of a story about sex workers that is often overlooked.

Unfortunately, I cannot give the film a solid five stars.  The lead actress, though sympathetic, is just not strong enough to really deliver ""Fernanda"" to us like the film deserves.

But that doesn't derail the film for me.  I think it should be required viewing for people who just don't understand the transgender experience and sex work.",1397260800,,1222,4.68075117370892
