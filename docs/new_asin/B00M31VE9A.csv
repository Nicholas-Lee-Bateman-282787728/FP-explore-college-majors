8669964,3,B00M31VE9A,"it's a good dvd set. but seriously can mtv just include all the stunts of the box set version and the commentary with the trivia game and whatever that was on the original separate releases? this set has volume 1 (with a commentary on 59 stunts),volume 2 (the original 2002 release that only had like 41 stunts but with a trviva game,photo gallery,& cast bios),volume 3 (the original 2002 release that only had like 55 stunts with a trivia game,photo gallery,& cast biographies),& the lost tapes (with every ""hi, i'm johnny Knoxville intro, every end credit montage,& and some videos from jackassworld (dot) com). they could've just have the box set versions of volumes 2 and 3 with the commentary and also include the trivia games and whatever. seriously is mtv too lazy to do that? and by the way, why did they only release the stunts randomly? seriously just include the original broadcast episodes instead of releasing them randomly. seriously letting the stunts be released in the original airing order sounds like more eazy to do than to schuffle them in random spots.",1420934400,5,1074,4.842391304347826
8669965,1,B00M31VE9A,For starters I already own the previous Jackass Complete TV Series. I bought this because it was unrated. After watching 5 minutes of it and hearing the bleep bleep I shut it off. This is not unrated! Not ripoff. Mtv or whatever. Do Not Buy!!! Waste of money.,1413590400,13,259,4.416666666666667
8669966,2,B00M31VE9A,"Oh buddy.  I picked this up at Wal-Mart the night of October 15.  With this being a relatively new release, I figured I would try to spread the word and let people know what they're in for with this set.  To begin, this isn't a bad set.  After all, it is Jackass.  The problem is that it promises a lot (like, written-on-the-case-slip promises) and doesn't deliver on a great deal of it.  For starters, you'll notice the case says this is an UNRATED collection.  Well...it's not.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.  It's all just as censored as it was in the Box Set (including the commentary on disc one - which brings me to my next point).  Next up, this set promises the audio commentary tracks that the Box Set had.  It delivers...but only on disc one.

Disc one is an identical reproduction of the first disc of the Box Set.  This is one of only two pros this set has, as many consider the first season to be the best and it was certainly the one the guys spent the most time on for the Box Set release.  So it does have Volume One in its entirety, which is awesome.

Discs 2 and 3?  Not even close.  Not even remotely.  These are my biggest complaint about the set.  For starters, the menus for them are the most bootleg-looking thing I've ever seen.  All the imagery and text are almost pixelated in a sense because of how hazy and messy they are.  These two discs contain no special features or commentary and contain maybe 30 skits/bits per disc - a very small fraction of what discs 2 and 3 of the Box Set had.  You do still get some of the best bits from those Volumes, but the lack of substance is still a bit disappointing.

That leaves disc 4.  Disc 4 is the gem of this set and arguably the biggest selling point of the whole thing.  This disc is the Lost Tapes DVD in its entirety - an identical reproduction, just like the first disc.  Of all the various Jackass DVD/Blu-Ray releases, the Lost Tapes is easily the hardest to find, so it's nice that Paramount included it here and didn't tamper with it in any way.

Overall, this condensed, watered-down, bare-bones re-release of the Box Set has some major glaring flaws to it (especially if you've ever owned the Box Set like I have), but I suppose if the unlikely possibility arises that you can't get your hands on the Box Set or the original three volumes and the Lost Tapes, this would certainly be the next best thing.",1413417600,15,2395,4.335585585585585
