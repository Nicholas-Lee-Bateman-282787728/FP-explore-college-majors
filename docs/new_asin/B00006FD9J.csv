1745028,1,B00006FD9J,"THIS SET STINKS. DON'T BOTHER. There was no way to rate this with negative stars or I would have, until the space ran out!!! Once again these films have been issued and once again they have been mastered from dirty, visibly deteriorated copies with washed-out colors and ugly edits. The films are not presented widescreen, which would be alright for some of them (""King of the Monsters"" and ""Rodan"" were not shot in widescreen in the first place) but again, there has been no clean-up, no restoration here in any way shape or form and obviously no footwork put into hunting down fresh prints from Toho (who confusingly gave this set their ""OkeeDoke"" - Why doesn't Toho CARE about this sort of thing???). It's unforgivable how poorly this material has been treated YET AGAIN and I wish I could return my copies to the company ...THEY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED BUT I'M SURE THEY DON'T CARE. If you're a fan of this genre or just a monster movie fan, please, PLEASE don't bother with this. Even the copy of ""Rodan"" looks washed out and trashed, and that was the set's centerpiece for cryin' out-loud!!!",1032048000,6,1093,4.639175257731959
1745029,4,B00006FD9J,"I've been waiting, waiting, and waiting some more of a Godzilla Boxed set to come out. Finally, it's here, and I must say that I am pretty derned happy with it. The Box is gorgious, the DVD pictures are gorgrous, and the movies are great. Despit Revenge of Godzilla, which is a pretty much 'crap' film the flicks are great. I love the original, and dig Terror of Mechagodzilla. I do have a few things I would've wished made it into the DVD set. I wanted widescreen, and I wanted better extras. Sure, the Destroy all Monsters Melee preview is good, but what about theatrical trailers? I would've been happy with just that. The animated menus are good, though look like Kung Pow's. Overall, this is a solid box set.",1031961600,5,713,4.492307692307692

The prints are scratched. Another opportunity wasted by a company that just did not give a damm about it's product.  And TOHO wonders why there is such an underground trading network in the high quality imports from Japan. With abominations like these, it's no wonder.",1031961600,2,424,4.72972972972973
1745031,3,B00006FD9J,"This set gets only 3 stars from me because much as I'd like to give it a whopping 5 stars, I can't because instead of going for the letterboxed widescreen versions of these classic Godzilla films, Sony instead just puts out the Full Screen versions, when they could very well have put them out letterboxed with extras - so what if it would have bumped the price up, Godzilla fans are many and loyal, and they would have provided an essential collection for us fans - but no, Sony dropped the ball. All of these films have already appeared on DVD and quite a few were widescreen, so I suggest you either seek out the now collectible out of print versions, or go for this set if you don't care and just want to see these great Godzilla films.
Now the good things about this box: The box itself is beautiful and the cost is cheap - you could almost spend the money to just get the cool box. Then there's Rodan - never before available on DVD - still it's full screen, but if you do not already have this on video, or the other Godzilla films on DVD - this set is a worthwile inexpensive purchase. I can't pick a favorite out of all of these since they are all great and classic in my opinion - and different enough to all merit a viewing - I even dig Revenge of Godzilla, just love that little Afternoon School Special kid running around with Baby G!

1745057,5,B00006FD9J,"My five year old son Dacien loves Godzilla, and wanting to get him a couple movies to start out with I thought I'd get this 5 dvd collection.  First of all this has Godzilla's first movie which is by far the best I ever remember from my days of watching Creature Features as a kid on the San Francisco UHF channels.  Also, although most adults will have no part of it, it has Godzilla's Revenge, All Monsters Attack! with the son of Godzilla, Minilla.  This is Dacien's favorite because there are about seven battles with different monsters, all by the way, listed on the DVD's jacket.  This is from 1969 and Godzilla is now a good guy and the movie is decidedly for children.

This set does however have Rodan, the original 1956 movie, from the same year the original Godzilla came out.  Very cool for the older fans of Japanese Monster movies.

Godzilla Vs. Mothra, 1964 is one of my favorites as a child and it still holds up pretty well today.  But Godzilla's battle to save the Earth, ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"", although totally campy (1975 release date), has all the elements of a perfect monster battle for young and old alike.  The robot-like MechaGodzilla is really very cool and the spacey themes will resonate with the younger audiences ala Transformers.  But the disgruntled mad-scientist and his telepathic daughter, will keep the adults who enjoy the campy goofy movies from the '70's, very happy too.

An off-beat collection of some of the fun Japanese movies from the 50's, 60's and 70's, you can't go wrong.  Sure the quality is just like it was when they came out, not very cleaned up, but thats the way they were when we were kids, and now my son is enjoying them.

These sets aren't available new anymore, but I got mine used here on Amazon for 12.98 and I see many are still selling now on here for 26 to 29 dollars, still very reasonable for 5 dvds.",1215734400,2,1871,4.532738095238095

1745062,5,B00006FD9J,"The Ultimate Godzilla DVD Collection has five movies.  The first film is Godzilla, King Of The Monsters.  It is the original movie that brought Godzilla to life on the big screen.  Well, the original did not have Raymond Burr in it, but you understand what I mean.  Godzilla is a 400 foot high Tyrannosaurus Rex woken up by an atomic bomb test.  Only 78 minutes, it isn't that long a movie.
The second film in the set is Godzilla Vs. Mothra.  Mothra, a giant moth, wants her giant egg back and is coming to Japan to get it.  Yes, I said moth.  Tiny twins, greedy businessmen and Godzilla all guest star in this flick.  Mothra would go to make her own flicks.
Godzilla's Revenge has a really bad plot but is really just an excuse to show off all those monsters from past films.  Just watch it to enjoy seeing Godzilla kicking [...].
Terror Of Mechagodzilla is a great film.  Alien invaders try to use a fake Godzilla, damaged from an earlier battle with Godzilla but not forgotten, to take over the Earth and only the real Godzilla can stop them.
Rodan is just a special bonus movie.  Flying at supersonic speeds, two giant creatures cause damage to buildings and snap up humans for lunch.  Yummy!

The new releases will feature both American and Japanese versions of the movies, and in their original aspect ratios (and with great extras!). Bottom line, only get this set if you're a casual movie viewer and don't care if your films are hacked up to be formatted to the screen. If you're a hardcore G-fan, I'm sure you already knew all this. (I would like to add, the rating I gave reflects the film presentation, not the actual films themselves.)",1146096000,12,740,4.7

The thing that really got to me was that the DVDs did not have closed captioning, though a lot of people don't use that anyway. Remember, the price is inexpensive because they are not the best godzilla movies, they are full of weird plots and stuff you'd think you'd see if you were intoxicated. The best movie in the collection was Rodan, I think. Remember, there is no godzilla in that movie.

Overall, I think any godzilla fan should get this, but someone who is not sure if they like godzilla should steer clear. They should go see Godzilla vs. Destroyah.",1141084800,2,681,4.448

1745081,5,B00006FD9J,"This is a really good Godzilla collection. Godzilla has been my favorite for about 2-3 months. Let me tell you my opinions on each of these movies......

Godzilla, King of the monsters: A very scary Godzilla film. This is in black and white and it is an AWESOME Godzilla movie and a lot of fun to watch at night!!!!!!!

Godzilla VS. Mothra: GREAT Godzilla film!!! I like Mothra a lot!!! I thought this was an excellent Godzilla film.

Godzillas Revenge: A bit babyish but cool. I like how Ichiro is running away from all of the bad guys and sprays them with the fire hydrant. A truly amazing film!!!

Terror of MechaGodzilla: COOL!!!!!!!!! I thought this one was pretty neat to!!!!!!! Titanosaurus (Is that how you spell it)? was very evil!! This is a great film!!!!!!!

Rodan: WOW!!!! Boy can Rodan cause a lot of destruction!!!!!! He can fly really fast!!!! The caterpillar things were creepy..... YIKES!!!!!!

1745082,4,B00006FD9J,"I have to admit the King of the Monsters.  The original black and white film was the most content full movie.  The rest are geared towards children.  I guess that's ok because most of us watch Godzilla to bring back the past.  As so with other shows like Dracula, Frankenstein, Creature from the Black Lagoon, or even Johnny Quest.  Anyway, these Godzilla films should be passed on.  The favourite in my book is the Terror of Mecha Godzilla.  I've seen the recent release of Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla and I don't like the name Kiryu or Mecha G as they call it.  The original just has a better body suit Mecha Godzilla.

The only thing about this box set is that it is in Pal format and I wish they had the wide screen.  I guess we'll have to wait until Sony and Toho Ltd. re-release all 24 movies.

By the way I can't wait til Godzilla Final Wars comes out here in the United States.  The final Godzilla movie is worth taking your children to watch I guess.",1105574400,2,959,4.29608938547486
1745099,5,B00006FD9J,"You spend a lot of money for education, read scholarly books and see interesting movies and watch Jeopardy. But hiding secretly in the back of my DVD colection away from prying yes.... GODZILLA!

I remember as a kid staying up late at night to watch the movies on TV. The stations in NY played them all the time on Saturdays and late night. The local theaters would play double and triple features and we'd wait in line, pay our 35 cents and stay for all of them. Sometimes twice. Imagine watching Godzilla movies from 10 am until midnight! Popcorn was dime and the drinks a nickel. Rocking!

I still love the movies but now I understand them a little better. They're not just monster movies. Well, they are monster movies, but like the Japanese, not everything is visible on the surface.

First of all this is great collection.  I think the quality is just fine, I am happy with the video and the sound, no complaints. The movies, oh the movies.

The first is still the best. Yeah, the old boy strolls through Tokyo like he has arthritis, yeah the models look like, well, models, yeah you can almost see the zipper on the back of the monster suit. But the quality of the acting is suprisingly good. Not only that but it was scary. It has suspense and in some scenes you actually felt the fear and the horror of being chased and stalked by a 400 foot fire breathing radioactive monster. Not bad really.

After watching the movies again ( and again ) I realized that they are realy more than just monster movies. Godzilla is a Japanese icon. He went from destroyer in the first movie and eventually morphed into Japans protector and hero.

I see a parallel to postwar Japanese cultural history, I can all be really summed up in Godzilla movies. In the first movie he was killer radioactive beast bent of destruction. People died. Raymond Burr starred as an Amercan jouralist and if you watch the role here you see a microcosm of Japans relationship with the US in the interactions. The Japanese being the only nation ever nuked, were understandably afraid of things radioactive. Yet the US sort of played the role of big brother and guide and protector while they showed their humility in front of the US. This can be seen quite clearly in this move. Later, when the Japanese accepted things nuclear, Godzilla became less of a threat and more of a partner or at least one with concurrent ends. Hey, if the old boy kicks Ghidras ass, then that gets Ghidra off Tokyo's case. Later the Japanese could actualy summon the old boy to helkp out in a fix.

With Mecha-Godzilla, the Japanese examined their relationship with advanced technology and the implications of getting too technological and forgetting their roots. Godzilla wins - the real one, the natural one.

The films all had detectable themes relating to Japans cultural and technological standing. From Japans embracing of technology, to their interest in spaceflight, concern for the environment and desire to take their place in world commerce and culture. It's all here.

Anyone wanting to study Japanese cultural history from the end of WWII I would say the these movies would as valuable as any reference material on the subject. Not to mention the girls are all pretty, the acting quality is acceptable and the movies are fun as hell!

I just hope my friends don't catch me watching them. Uncultured louts all of them! They will just never understand.

I can't wait to share these with my granddaughter.",1095379200,15,3464,4.6792763157894735
1745100,4,B00006FD9J,"A lot of people are dwelling on the negatives of this box set, but I want to talk about the positives. Maybe it isn't truly the ultimate collection, but it's enjoyable, and the quality is far better than was available on video, and unbelievably better than watching it on late night UHF television in the 1960s and 1970s.
I too, subtracted a star for the lack of widescreen format, although, to me that is largely irrelevant, as this is the way I remember these films from when I saw them on TV as a kid. I have seen a lot of complaints about dirty and abused transfers, but, honestly, I think the DVD quality looks reasonable for films of this age, certainly better than many films of this vintage that are currently available on DVD. All told, my assessment of the prints is that they aren't perfect, but they are still very enjoyable to watch, and more than adequate.
As far as the collection itself goes, I might have made other choices for the five movies, likely leaving out 'Terror of Mechagodzilla', and 'Godzilla's Revenge' (although if you have kids, 'Revenge' is a good way to initially expose them the Godzilla.) It is wonderful to see 'Rodan' in the collection. To my recollection, this is the first time 'Rodan' has been on DVD, so for that alone, the set is worth the money.
It is easy to pick these movies apart from a technical point of view, or to endlessly argue about which movies would be better included in an ""ultimate"" collection, but until someone releases the entire series in widescreen, with tons of extras, you can't make everybody happy, and even then, people will be complaining about the $200 price tag.
Take this set for what it is: five fun monster movies. With that in mind, sit back, relax, and enjoy.",1088294400,32,1737,4.57051282051282

Anyone who has any of these movies on video, should just keep your videos and forget about it. All the companies out there who plan on making a fast buck with poor versions of movies, keep your crappy DVDs we don't want them. It is about time that we get some quality versions of the older monster movies. In Japan you can get every film uncut and in widscreen; why can't we be treated the same, isn't are money just as good. We are fans who love these films and want to enjoy the very best version that we can. In the future please think of the many fans out there.

So many explosions and effects exploding in sharp colour, and awesome roars and the rika-tika of army machine guns on a sorround sound stereo is what I wanted. My expectations were a bit too high. First of all, the selection. Godzilla, King of the Monster. An INSTANT essential in any Godzilla collection with the word 'Ultimate' included. Godzilla vs. Mothra was a nice choice, not bad at all. Godzilla's Revenge. OK, now do not get me wrong folks, i am obsessed with all Godzilla films and love them all more than any movie, well any thing in the world. But why did they have to include this one out of all the films? I would have prefered Godzilla vs. Monster Zero, Godzilla vs. Gigan or Godzilla vs. Ebirah if we are talking in terms of the showa series. Thats alright, this is still a pretty fun film, just wondered why that one of all was included. Terror of Mechagodzilla. This is a  great Godzilla flick, not a bad choice - but it is thrown in with the earlier Showa flicks which is a bit odd, since TOM is the last Showa Godzilla Film. Rodan. Rodan? Rodan. Rodan?! Why? I thought this was a Godzilla Collection! Well, Rodan is awesome as Godzilla's sidekick in his films, and Rodan is a pretty good film but I wanted them all to be Godzilla Films. Godzilla vs. Hedorah or Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla prehaps? Now that that is out of the way, on to the transfer. Godzilla King of the Monsters - The Sound Transfer is very very nice on my sorround sound, no inconvenient humming or buzzing during the quiet moments. The soundtrack transfer rocks! The Picture has been sharpened a bit, but still is a tad bit murky. Godzilla vs. Mothra - The Picture is nice and sharp, better than GKOTM. The Sound is great as well. Mothra's chirping does get annoying though, lol. Godzilla's revenge - The Picture quality is pretty much the same as my video, scratchy in places. But the sound is amazing! The jazz score the beggining kicks! Terror of Mechagodzilla - Both Picture and Sound are excellent on this transfer. Rodan - Sound is a bit musty and murky, a bit blurbed if you will - but the picture is good.
I don't know why people complained about the transfers so much - They are actually pretty good. Maybe something is wrong with their Stereo or Screen. I have a big screen and 5-piece sorround stereo set up so I notice alot of the details.
Anyway, this is a nice set. Good Transfers, All the films rock -
but the inclusion of 'Rodan' sags the rating a bit.",1062201600,6,2540,4.474137931034483
1745104,3,B00006FD9J,"I've fumed about the treatment of Godzilla video releases in America in other reviews. Simitar is the only company to come close to getting it right. (I didn't own a DVD player at the time so this collection is all I have on DVD.) The Simitar collection has been handed over to and given little respect by Sony Media Entertainment. All movies are shown in full-screen here, even though Simitar offered some letterboxed tapes.
The 1956 edition of the first Godzilla movie is the only good thing in this collection. The image quality is much better than the Goodtimes DVD. It would be great if the original 1954 edition was available in America like Neptune Video offered the original Japanese edition of the first Gamera movie. In 1956, scenes with Raymond Burr were added in as he simply observed the events in the original 1954 film. You can see the differences in the approach to filmmaking.
Godzilla vs. Mothra (aka Godzilla vs. The Thing) was available in letterboxed format from Simitar so I know Sony could have offered it too. Godzilla's Revenge has been shown in letterboxed format on AMC. In English, Terror of Mechagodzilla has only existed as a censored print since 1980. In 1979, there was an essentially uncut version being shown on TV. The reason for Mechagodzilla's defeat is totally missing because a death scene was censored out. Now, the ending makes no sense.
Sony Entertainment and possibly Toho are simply going through the motions to sell DVDs. NONE of the Godzilla movies are being shown any respect that the fans want to see. Some of the companies handling the Gamera movies are doing what fans want. Neptune Video offered letterboxed and subtitled tapes of 3 of the older Gamera movies. ADV is selling the newer Gamera movies as both subtitled and dubbed on DVD.
I'm tempted to say don't buy this set or the individual DVDs and get the Gamera ones (at least the new ones) in the hopes that someone at Sony might notice what fans want, but I don't think Sony or Toho care about the American fans. Not buying them could simply mean the titles go off the market like the other older Godzilla titles at the moment.
There are no current DVDs of Gigantis - the Fire Monster (aka Godzilla Raids Again), King Kong vs. Godzilla, Ghidrah - The Three Headed Monster, Godzilla vs. Monster Zero, Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster, Son of Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Hedorah (aka ...vs. The Smog Monster), Godzilla vs. Gigan (aka Godzilla on Monster Island), Godzilla vs. Megalon, Gozilla vs. Mechagodzilla (aka ...vs. The Cosmic Monster, ...vs. The Bionic Monster), Godzilla 1985, Godzilla vs. Biollante, and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. ...plus all movies after 2000. There might be some discontinued DVDs of a few titles, but all of these appear to be missing on DVD right now. A truly ultimate collection should include all or most of these titles or at least all of the first set of movies from 1954-1975 (Japanese release dates). That would include the original through Terror of Mechagodzilla. ...which also had the same actor in the Godzilla suit for all of them. He was also in the suit for Godzilla 1985, I think. I can't remember his name.
As a fan, I feel insulted with each video release from Sony. I also wish Toho would display some interest in fans and push for quality DVD releases that show some respect for the titles.",1050796800,13,3340,4.750430292598967
1745105,3,B00006FD9J,"This is definately a good collection of movies, but it is not the ultimate collection.  It has some of the best classic Godzilla movies available, beginning with what is undoubtably the best in the whole series, Godzilla-King of the Monsters, this is where it all began.
It then moves on to Godzilla vs. Mothra, which, although sometimes corny, is still a great flick.
Then you have Terror of Mechagodzilla, which is probably the second best movie in the entire series.  It, along with the movie prior to it, brought Godzilla back to the original dark, brooding theme.
Then they went and added not only worst Godzilla movie, but also the worst movie I have ever seen: Godzilla's Revenge.  In order to have the ultimate collection of classic Godzilla movies, they should have added Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla instead of Godzilla's Revenge.
Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla and Terror of Mechagodzilla are direct sequels to each other, and are also the ONLY two movies where the idea of Godzilla being a hero actually works.  Rodan being added to the collection is also a very nice touch.
In closing, this is imperative to any Godzilla fan, but it definately could be improved.",1050364800,2,1169,4.918781725888325
1745106,3,B00006FD9J,"I bought this when I wasn't even really into Godzilla too much (which was quite recently). It wasn't bad. Even though it was full screen and the sound was a little shabby I enjoyed it. I watched King of the Monsters and was overwhelmed. Absolutely loved it, regardless to its Americanization. Honestly, however most of the set was pretty dull. Lots of talking and the stories weren't that engaging. The monsters were pretty hokey (which i expected, but also expected I would still like) and the fight scenes weren't that amazing either. In fact the only thing that kept me into G' as much as I am now was GMK. I read about GMK (Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah) in Animerica. It was what I felt I was ""studying"" for by watching hours upon hours of G films. I have since viewed GMK on VCD (because there's no official US version on DVD yet) and was amazed. Absolutely amazing. So if you're into G don't bother with this set. If you aren't but you're interested it probably won't help much either. But check out some of the 90's G films because they are spectacular. I don't regret buying the set, but I kinda wish I would've just bought the Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla/Godzilla vs. Destoyah split DVD or the Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah DVD.
I hope that a lot of people will still buy this DVD set so that a stronger G following in the US will materialize. That American flic with Matthew Broderick ruined everything and now we may not get any of the incredible films being made after 2000 in Japan over here for a long time.",1045785600,,1525,4.469534050179211

This set has DESTRUCTION written all over it! the set is awesome but ""Godzilla's Revenge"" which is included in the set isn't a good movie at all. It would've been better if they put ""Destroy All Monsters"" in there instead. To me ""Godzilla's Revenge"" is a bore but the other four dvd's are awesome. In ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"", Godzilla really pitches a fit. and of course the movie ""Rodan"" shows what destruction is all about. ""Godzilla King of the Monsters"" is great to because he smashes the heck out of Tokyo Also ""Godzilla vs Mothra' is reaaly destructive too. Over all, this set deserves a few A+'S for all the destruction it has. But godzilla's revenge has reduced my grade to a B.",1042761600,,812,4.568493150684931
1745118,3,B00006FD9J,"Let me just quickly state the multiple reasons why this collection is totally unworthy of the title: THE ULTIMATE GODZILLA DVD COLLECTION. First off, there's only 3 films in this box set that Godzilla fans really go for. And 2 of them, fans don't even consider the best. There are no special feature options. No widescreen option (which a lot of people prefer for some reason). And even though the picture quality is a bit more sharper than the regular VHS versions, the sound is horrible, forcing you to really crank up the TV just to hear it. These Godzilla films are not the original Japanese versions, and it's all completely dubbed in English. Some of the scenes have been AMERCANIZED, and some of the Japanese scenes taken OUT! Pitiful. Someone must really hate us Godzilla fans, because we are always forced to resort to buying our uncut 'Zilla movies from low budget, underground distributors who get films that have been copied over a dozen times by other foreign distributors, and hence us (the audience) gets to see our original 'Zilla movies through a tint of haze and static. Hopefully, in the future, more 'Zilla DVD box sets will come out.
And if you're not interested in all that, and just want to buy a few good monster flicks for your child, then that would make this DVD collection a bad choice, since none of these would really entertain a child's mind. They're more for adults, who are kids at heart. Talk, talk, talk, throughout each film, which no kid wants to sit through. If you want a 'Zilla movie for your child, get him/her either 'Son of Godzilla' (I loved that one when I was a kid) or, 'Godzilla 1985' which probably has the most realistic fight/city destruction scenes of any Godzilla movie, and it doesn't take forever to get there. Another favorite of mine when I was a child, if not my most favorite.",1041379200,17,1835,4.631901840490798
1745119,4,B00006FD9J,"It's Great to see these classic films in such great quality, but there are very few things that make this set lose a star. First off the lack of special features. next is the absence of a few essential classics, namely 1. Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero 2. Destroy all Monsters and 3. godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster (a.k.a. Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla). It looks as though a second box set is in order Overall a must have for any fan.",1040774400,2,429,4.375
1745120,5,B00006FD9J,"These are the same great Godzilla movies I remember staying up and watching Saturday evenings on TV as a child on.  When I read the poor reviews here, I expected grainy video with poor audio, but the video and audio quality were great, in my opinion; much better than any VHS tape. These are the full screen versions that were aired on U.S. TV, and that's what I prefer anyways, and remember seeing as a child. My 6 year old son gets as excited as I did (and still do) at the monster fight scenes.  We are both extremely happy with the set.",1038614400,2,540,4.233009708737864
1745121,2,B00006FD9J,"I've waited for years for someone to do the original Godzilla series justice but obviously I'll have to wait longer. This is an unusual selection, probably due to copyright laws; two of the most dismal episodes in the series, ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" & ""Godzilla's Revenge"", make it into what is called the 'Ultimate Collection'. Terrible transfers, video-quality sound and no widescreen presentations. It pains me that American distributors continue to treat these classic films as unworthy of serious attention. Anyone who has experienced the pure joy of ""Son of Godzilla"", ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster"", ""Godzilla vs. the Bionic Monster"", ""Ghidrah the Tree-Headed Monster"" or ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" will share my disappointment in this DVD box set. I would love to get the entire series in widescreen and especially with the option to view the films as they appeared in the original Japanese as well as the English dubs. Special features? I'd even sacrifice those for a clean transfer and 5.1 surround sound. This isn't to suggest that this box set contains any special features, just the occasional trailer and the ubiquitous advertisement for a Godzilla-themed video game. What I wouldn't give for the chance to see ""Godzilla King of the Monsters"" in the original Japanese and without the Raymond Burr scenes! Someday...",1038096000,36,1336,5.21860465116279
1745122,4,B00006FD9J,"They should have included ""Gigantis"" in this collection. But it's utterly enjoyably, from the two little singing twin girls in ""Mothra"" to the sad ending in ""Rodan"". The ""Godzilla"" print is of poor quality, I've seen much better, but it's still ""Godzilla"". If you're a true Godzilla fan, you won't be sorry if you buy this collection.",1037664000,4,334,4.87719298245614
1745123,3,B00006FD9J,"Well I was really excited when I heard about these movies, especially because Rightstuf had them listed on their site as subtitled in english, because that is what they were told they were going to be. I couldn't wait for it to come out. Then I see it at the store, great packaging, even the Gojira kanji was on it, so I looked around, and saw no language listings. Even the store workers didn't know what it was, then I found out it was dub edit, fullscreen. I didn't bother to buy it. I rented them, and was horrified when I saw them. The quality was horrible[...] I have the Simitar release of the first movie, and the picture quality was better, and it was in widescreen. If you are able to find them, I'd say you are better off picking up the releases by Simitar that game out yrs ago. I kinda like the dubs to the newer movies, but these dubs are horrible. I bought an all region player, and bought the R2 dvd or the original, and it was worth the price I paid for it.  Remastered, hardly any scratch marks, and uncut in Japanese.  Who cares if there are no subs.  I also have Godzilla 2000 Millennium, Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 93 and Return of Godzilla (Jap version G 1985) on dvd with no subs, while GMK and Godzilla X Megaguirus are R3's so they have subs.  I love Godzilla, but this is an outrage. With the current technology of dvd, I think there is no excuse as to why we can't have what we G Fans have been waiting for for many many centuries. lol",1035072000,6,1461,4.225806451612903
1745124,2,B00006FD9J,"Part of me is really pleased that these classics are available on the market again (and Rodan on DVD for the first time!). And the box design is truly nice, the best that kaiju films have ever seen in the U.S.
But Classic Media (and Toho, and Sony) should be ashamed of themselves for the really poor quality of the transfer itself. Others have written plenty here about it, and I couldn't agree more. For the first time, I will actually be holding onto my VHS versions as the sound and image quality of some of my VHS is far better than what was presented here. Of course, what do we expect for [money] But I think many of us would *gladly* pay twice as much for just *one* of these movies presented with a clean image, widescreen if available, subtitled original available, and decent extras (well, maybe not for Godzilla's Revenge ;-)
I had really hoped for so much more, especially as these might preceed some release from Sony/CTHE of the more recent (and excellent) films ""Godzilla vs Megagairus"" and ""Godzilla|Mothra|King Ghidorah"". But disasters like this set, the American GINO film, and the general treatment of Godzilla movies over the years leads me to believe that those who control this market just don't care about the property, or those who love it.
So I'd like to see the set sell well so that Godzilla continues to get the exposure deserved, and perhaps to encourage the studios involved to provide us with better quality product...",1032739200,81,1450,4.690196078431373
1745125,1,B00006FD9J,"What can one say about The Ultimate Godzilla DVD Collection?  Several words come to mind, especially ""been there, saw that.""  At first glance Sony Music Entertainment's Classic Media seemed to have done a good job.  The box holding the 5 DVDs (Godzilla King of the Monsters, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla's Revenge, Terror of MechaGodzilla and Rodan) is nicely done, with a holographic image of the first Godzilla taken from the promotional poster donning both sides of the case.  In addition, the individual DVDs themselves are nicely packaged sporting what can honestly be said as the best artwork to ever grace the cover of a Godzilla video, both DVD or tape.
The problem however, is when one opens the box and plays the individual DVDs themselves. The first hint that one notices there is something wrong is the absence of any booklets or additional information, the case containing only the DVD itself.
Then there is the information stored on the DVDs.  Unlike the Simitar DVDs, there are no extras, no trailers, no trivia questions, save for a promo for the new Nintendo Game Cube; Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters game.  As for the quality of the films, they are the same old pan and scan transfers as the old Paramount/Gateway home video releases of the late 1980s, and suffer from numerous scratch marks.  The forced surround sound audio tracks have even more echo and tinny sound than the Simitar versions.  Worst of all, Terror of MechaGodzilla is the same edited version fans have had to suffer through for years.
About the only saving grace is the inclusion of Rodan in the set; representing the first time this film has seen a DVD release.  Conspicuous by its absence however is Monster Zero, which was originally included in the Simitar box set.  Its absence is probably due more to the fact that Monster Zero's copyright in North America is held by Henry Saperstein's UPA Productions than Sony's decision to release Rodan (a box set containing all 5 Godzilla film plus Rodan could have been released).
Overall if you already own the Simitar DVDs then spending the [$$$] on The Ultimate Godzilla DVD Collection is a waist of your hard earned cash.  Considering the waning interest in Godzilla since the Tri-Star film, one would have hoped that Sony, as well as Toho, would have learned that unless you're willing to put out a decent product on Godzilla, you might as well not put one out at all.",1032480000,2,2408,4.820388349514563

I will say this box set isn't as well set up as it could be. It's missing certain movies that would be helpful to the first-time viewer. It has The King of Monsters which is a good movie to watch. The next movie is Godzilla's Revenge which was less rewarding. It was pretty much a waste of time. It was made for kids and badly made for anyone at that. They could have easily skipped this movie for this and any collection. The third movie, Terror of MechaGodzilla, is out of order. There's already been MechaGodzilla before, but that previous movie isn't included, so I was a little lost watching this one. I got over it, yes, but still. The fourth movie, Godzilla vs Mothra, wasn't too bad, but those tiny twin women were just annoying in how they spoke and sang. The final disc, Rodan, was a nice movie, but the Rodan weren't that well made. Considering the detail they put into their other monsters, Rodan was just disappointing. The movies were delivered quickly enough. They make a big package which the mailman crammed into my box, mind you, but that's the fault of the mailman, not Amazon.",1402358400,,1246,4.542222222222223
