8418439,4,B00480780I,I really enjoyed this video. Maria Kliegel is well spoken and thorough. My only regret was that she didn't spend more time on bowing issues. A lot of her suggestions were about how to use Starker's concept of topographical shifting which when explained once probably didn't need as many examples.,1439942400,,296,4.94
8418440,4,B00480780I,"To put this in perspective, I have only been playing cello for three years. With that kind of experience I thought this ""Master Class"" might be way beyond my musical comprehension, and in some ways it is. On the other hand, as I watch the lessons and listen to the instructions I still find things that I can relate to. Then, as I progress in my playing, I'm reminded of something that is taught in the video and can go back and review that lesson. The comprehension is sealed then. So what I'm saying is that there is so much to be learned from a master player and we as students have it all to gain if we're willing to practice. These lessons teach something new every time I watch them. I would rate this product five stars were it not for the audio mix on the DVD itself. Maria Kliegel's instructions, in German, need to be mixed much further below the translator's English for an easy listen. As it is, it's like two people talking at once, making it difficult to hear one or the other.",1369958400,2,991,4.304812834224599
8418441,5,B00480780I,"I know of no other comparable product.  Maria Kliegel is not only an accomplished cellist, but a renowned teacher, and here she shares from her exceptional repertoire of playing methods and techniques.  Although I'm still a beginning cellist, I found many great ideas here to help me become a better cellist, and to make my practice times more effective.  She makes heavy use of imagery in describing playing techniques, which helps me more easily remember the concepts she presents.  I've watched her segments on bow technique and fingering several times, and always notice something new.  Something I found especially helpful is her emphasis on kinesiology, and how it can help in becoming a more relaxed and fluid cellist, as well as helping to prevent injury.  Beyond this, she explains how she masters difficult pieces and passages, through which I catch glimpses of some of the ""why's"" I sometimes ask when practicing exercises, as well as ""aha's"" when observing her creativity in handling extreme challenges. I highly recommend these DVDs for any cellist.",1295481600,10,1062,5.145348837209302
