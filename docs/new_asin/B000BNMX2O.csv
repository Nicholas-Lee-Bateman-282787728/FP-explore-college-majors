8089443,5,B000BNMX2O,"Focusing on some of the best works of Thomas Alva Edison.

This film encompasses his later work in his dying days, rather than the beginning of his career in the late 1800's.

Truly a dedicated man, hope everyone enjoys as much as I did.

Does anyone know if the others are good?

Thanks for the fast shipping!",1273017600,,310,4.385964912280702
8089444,5,B000BNMX2O,"This DVD provides just under an hour's worth of Edison's later works on films including a short film on the inventor himself. The visual quality of the films is surprisingly good considering their age and what I have encountered in other films from that era. Features included are:

The Good Sport - This 1918 Edison short film features the story a young but penniless inventor Faraday who marries the daughter of a rich old man, despite objections. The film depicts the hardships the young couple had to endure before Faraday's invention fetched him a princely sum of 100,000 dollars and a lot of fame and respect as well. The moral of this short narrative is pretty obvious - never give up.

A Day with Thomas A. Edison - Thomas Edison was a busy man. Even towards the end of his illustrious life, Edison followed a strict work regimen, which took him to his office, factories and his laboratory. This 1922 film follows the great inventor on a typical workday. Seen here are some of the most accomplished scientists who were on Edison's payroll.

Visiting' 'Round at Coolidge Corners - This biographical short covers a day in the life of President Calvin Coolidge during his annual visit to his farm and his father's country home. It was made in 1924 and  is as slick a piece of campaign film as ever came out of any studio. President Coolidge is presented as a simple man of the people who helps his cousin with the haying when he is in the neighborhood, works in the building he was born in and lives in the same house his father was born in - just another fellow like you and me.

There are also some early advertisements for the electric refrigerator, Flash Cleaner, Onward Flour, and an advertisement for the Warner corset that lasts almost four minutes.

You are probably going to have to be a film history buff with an interest in Edison and his work in early film to appreciate this DVD, but if you are, it is quite a treasure.",1167955200,,1937,4.551724137931035
8089445,5,B000BNMX2O,"I've purchased several of the Edison early film reels and this is by far the most ""modern"" of the bunch. What I mean by that is that there is less of the experimental film techniques that Edison used when he was first trying out his equipment and more of an emphasis on professional storytelling and image placement. They were only shot about six months after the original Edison films, so it's interesting to see how Edison deviloped his skills in a very short period of time. The restoration values are pretty good, considering that these movies are well over 100 years old.",1153094400,,576,4.6568627450980395
