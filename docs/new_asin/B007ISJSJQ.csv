8517786,4,B007ISJSJQ,"Its been a long wait since the last North American release of episodes of the long-running TRIAL & RETRIBUTION police drama. Its been well worth the wait, but it has also served to provide a bit of distance from the previous, stellar episodes, and the more recent, still very good, but somewhat declining-in-quality later episodes.

This set contains four two-part dramas from the shows 11th and penultimate season. Hopefully we will soon have the final release from Acorn Media, which will, if the pattern continues, feature the last four two-part dramas in the series. This will include the fifth two-parter from season 11, and the three two-parters from the last season, season 12.

Confused? It took me some digging to figure all that out, but it was worth it to be brought up to speed.

At the centre of this fine drama is the excellent David Hayman as Det. Supt. Mike Walker, a tough, tormented and thoroughly watchable protagonist who is just a little bit shady sometimes. Since way back in the second set of episodes released in North America, Victoria Smurfit as DCI Roisin Connor has been Haymans main professional antagonist, though they are supposed to be colleagues.

This is the most obvious area of the writing starting to bog down. Their conflicts are no longer heady criticism between two strong personalities; suddenly we have two immature, foul-mouthed teenagers going at it hammer and tong. Hayman can usually get away with it because Walkers world-weariness is the obvious source of his aggression. But Smurfit has no obvious motivation (although a personal issue is brought in as some sort of explanation, by the time it comes up it feels like a tacked-on excuse), and young Roisin comes across as ice cold and mean-spirited. She seems to argue for the sake of arguing, and its irritating.

That is why it was such a welcome relief in this set to have a reprieve from Roisins histrionics. In the gripping double episode The Box, Mike Walker goes home to Glasgow on leave to deal with family obligations. He gets caught up in a gruesome series of killings and briefly partners with DI Moyra Lynch, played by Kerry Fox, who is a wonderful breath of fresh air after Smurfits unrelenting anger. Foxs scene when she announces that she wants pizza for breakfast is hilarious, and shows that she can be just as interpersonally contrary, but without all the sneering  easily the most annoying trait about Roisin Connor.

All four episodes are tightly-written and complex, though to be truthful they lack the spark that only Lynda La Plante herself can bring to things. Her sharp dialogue is sorely missed. The violence is still very strong, but justified by the intense plots.

The bad language content increases with each season of production, which is a shame. Profanity is, 9 times out of 10, an indication of weak, unimaginative writing. Yes, people talk like that in real life, but this isn't real life, no matter how much such shows purport to be realistic. The fact is, entertainment is always heightened reality. Otherwise most people would be sickened and outraged at the horrible proceedings (or bored to tears at the mundanity of all the real details). In a world of heightened reality, intelligence is one option  expletives is the other. Clear, taut communication of ideas is paramount when time is of the essence, as it is in serial TV drama. Profanity suggests strong emotion, but communicates nothing about what that emotion might be, much less the cause of it. Its a waste of time and opportunity. The easiest route for the writer rarely leads to the best experience for the audience.

Theres still life in TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, no question. Enough to warrant significant anticipation for the final four films. This is due in some part to the change of scene in The Box, but quite apart from that, Mike Walker is a compulsively watchable protagonist. Haymans decision to use his real-life scar above his left eye says volumes about the tough, diminutive Scot who one wouldnt want to meet in a back alley. He is completely believable in this role and when weve seen the last of TRIAL & RETRIBUTION it will be this short mans long shadow that well remember.

One final note: if, like me, you have become enamoured of British programs to the point where you purchase shows that are not yet available here, be advised that many UK DVD format shows do not have closed captioning. This is important for dialogue clarity (those accents can sometimes be hard to catch). And if you have hearing issues (like this reviewer), it can be crucial. To their everlasting credit, Acorn Media continues to provide captioning in their ongoing commitment to reaching as wide an audience for their superior product as possible. Sometimes you have to wait for it, but its worth it.",1397433600,,4789,4.849449204406365

8517789,5,B007ISJSJQ,"I have the entire series and it is very absorbing. I think they did the right thing in ending it when they did as there is so much possible of a good thing. The characters are highly credible, and David Hayman is excellent in his portrayel of ""Mike"" the driven and totally (at times) over the top DCI, who would be absolutely unliveable with  !!! Well worth watching not once but twice !!",1357948800,3,388,4.315068493150685
8517790,5,B007ISJSJQ,The series is true to life and I love the acting ability of its stars. Find out for yourself soon.,1357430400,2,98,3.95
8517791,5,B007ISJSJQ,"Set 5 is intense, complex multi-faceted plots, always a bit of an extra twist. Cliff hanging intrigue.  Violent crime, progresses through cops to verdict. Box warns of disturbing images, nudity, and language--a huge understatement.
Graphic morgue & crime location scenes. Once beyond the graphic scenes, there is some excellent writing, gripping plot, and relationships of characters. Often confrontational.
NOT KID STUFF--for YA+ with a strong tolerance.
Contemporary filming, often using split screen.

Series leads: DS Mike Walker (David Hayman -'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas') seem it all
DCI Roisin Connor (Victoria Smurfit -'Berkeley Square' 'Ballykissangel') hard body and attitude

The Rules of the Game
Rent-girl, Sofia (Olga Fedori -oh my!!) dead in a trunk at Heathrow. Suspect a rich Ukrainian who confesses to violent sex upon his release.

Conviction

Lies, bent copper, new clues added to old and new cases all have a chaotic blend.

The Box
Walker, on leave in Scotland, looks for a friend's sister. Margaret disappeared 8 years before another new case of Anna going missing. Both were married to Kevin Reid. D.I. Mullins (David O'Hara -`Tudors'), DI Lynch (Kerry Fox) and DS Satch make up the crime team in this episode. Kevin & stammering brother Ronnie seem where evidence points. But who? A fiery finish line.",1335398400,17,2452,5.21882951653944
