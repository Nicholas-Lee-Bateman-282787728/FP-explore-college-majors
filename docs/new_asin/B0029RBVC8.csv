8358133,1,B0029RBVC8,Don't buy this DVD. Not even worth a penny.  Video is bright and horrible. Sound isn't much better. Bootleg!  This guy shouldn't be allowed to sell this stuff.  Disney or Buena Vista or whoever owns the rights should put out the original version with all episodes and bonus features.  They show it on Disney XD sometimes. Why is a bootleg our only recourse?,1353974400,3,357,4.619047619047619
8358134,4,B0029RBVC8,My childhood favorite returns. awesome. can't wiat for the rest of the series to come out on dvd. only one thing different. no intrduction by Stan Lee. wonder why?,1340064000,,163,4.655172413793103
8358135,2,B0029RBVC8,A lot of our beloved toons are being released in Europe.  This series was released with many others over seas that have not been released in America.  Yes this is a bootleg but the quality might be good.  I stress might. I personally just went on-line and downloaded the European versions which are of GREAT quality (Remastered) and made my own set.  You can transfer it from PAL to NTSC.  Stan Lee's narrations are absent but I still love watching them.  I have done this with many other cartoons.  Save your money and make your own set. Today this is very easy to do because every computer comes standard with a DVD burner and programs to do it. I will buy the set once released in America and I would advise everyone to do the same.  Or buy the European versions from Amazon Europe if you have an all region DVD player.  I like to have originals myself.,1257811200,15,856,4.367088607594937
8358136,1,B0029RBVC8,"Why is this terriffic show that was one of the hightlights of the 80's saturday morning not on dvd? How many of us grew up glued to the television watching Spider-man , Ice man and Hotstuff every Weekend morning . Why has this not been sheduled for release When so many other Spider-man titles are? Take a cue from D.C. / Warners guys and relese all your vintage treasures. Oh and buy the way , don't buy this crappy bootleg for anything less than $0.01 . In fact you may find better versions on vhs. And the same goes for Street Hawk and some of those other 80's shows on bootleg. Not worth the price. Take it from a friend who's made those mistakes.",1248825600,24,651,4.258064516129032
8358137,1,B0029RBVC8,"This, along with many other DVD sets in the seller's storefront (click on their name, ""karacancel"", which used to be ""reflectmagic"", which might be something else next week) are shoddy bootlegs.

Check out some of the reviews on their other questionable sets--mentioned are poor episode/video quality, the box art not looking like it's pictured here when they receive it, and no extras.

This is not sold by Amazon.com directly.  Wonder why there are no sellers in the Amazon Marketplace selling used copies ?  Because very few other people (aside from those who've bought from this bootlegger) have copies of this set to sell !  This seller is CREATING these DVDs, so there's no competition and it's guaranteed profit off of something they had nothing to do with.

Eventually Marvel (or Beuna Vista/Disney, or whoever has the rights to this series currently) will get around to releasing an official, hopefully better quality set, with extras, and perhaps some of the profits from those sales will make it back to the creative people involved with making Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.  Those are the people who should be compensated, not one sad person (or perhaps a small group) who simply burn some DVDs and print out some self-made box art.

Don't buy this set.  Patience will reward you with something better when the official version is released.",1243814400,60,1358,5.0
