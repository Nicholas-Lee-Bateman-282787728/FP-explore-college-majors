8560451,5,B00B0ZXNZS,"You probably wouldn't be looking for Rex Steele: Nazi Smasher if you hadn't at least heard of it before.  Maybe from the graphic novel or maybe some buzz about this short film.  Either way, picking up this DVD is a treat.  The film is set up as a episode from a classic serial, with enough lead in and conclusion to give us a satisfying movie, but leaving us with the idea that this is part of a bigger world or that perhaps more episodes could exist (though they don't.)  The animation is clean and crisp, better than what you'd get with most animated shorts.  What the filmmakers lacked in budget, they made up for in skill, dedication and time.

The disc is jam packed with extras including 3 audio commentaries, and isolated soundtrack, effects only soundtrack, 3 documentaries about production and more.  Everything is excellent and interesting, though some of the documentary material doesn't live up the the production quality of the feature.  We're also treated to a bonus disc with the Ryan Shore's excellent soundtrack.

The packaging is as slick and professional as is the film itself.  It's truly impressive to see this level of quality from a student film (albeit an award winning student film.)

For fans of indie animation, great short films and student films this is a worthy addition to one's DVD collection.",1366588800,,1325,4.79295154185022
