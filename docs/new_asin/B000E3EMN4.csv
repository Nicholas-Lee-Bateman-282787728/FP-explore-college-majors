8104983,5,B000E3EMN4,"As far as I know, this tape of Les Brown speaking to an audience in Chicago in 1992, has never been re-released on DVD.  I will say, however, that if you manage to get a copy of this VHS tape, it will be one reason not to get rid of your VCR.

If you have never heard of Les Brown, let alone never heard him speak, this tape is the one you need to watch first.  You may find yourself seeking out his other lecture series and books afterwards.

Mr. Brown is up there with some of the greatest motivational speakers ever, easily ranking alongside Tony Robbins and Zig Ziglar among others.  He doesn't just tell you to never give up.  Through a profound talent for public speaking, a speaking power full of pure gusto, and a knack for compelling storytelling, he persuades you to stay in the fight without resorting to gimmicks.

I happened to find this tape at a time when I had experienced a major setback and was in the midst of borderline clinical depression. Seeing this tape, and hearing Mr. Brown speak, motivated me to be a stronger person, and made me excited for the challenges that lay ahead in my life.

To say my life has not been the same since I saw this tape would be a gross understatement. Whenever I face a rut in my life, or need a good pick-me-up to get through a problem, I pop this tape into my VCR, and probably watch it at least once a year.",1392768000,,1363,4.235521235521236

This video has been an important part of getting my student's attention and motivating them in the courses. If you haven't seen this amazing video, you need to see it. Buy it for your kids. The issues he addresses are timeless and as important today as they were when he first made this video. He has more recent products, but this is the one that grabs you by the insides.",1285545600,,482,4.551724137931035
8104985,5,B000E3EMN4,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Im a huge fan of Les Brown's and I share his message with everyone I know. Especially this video. This is the very lecture that introduced me to Les via Chicago PBS in 1992. It is by far my favorite of his many lectures. It gave me the fuel I needed to move here to NYC to pursue my dream career as an actor/comedian. Outside of my burning desire to make it happen, this video has been a huge part of keeping me focused on my dream and creating uncompromising courage. I only wish that it were on DVD not VHS.",1244332800,,531,4.066666666666666
