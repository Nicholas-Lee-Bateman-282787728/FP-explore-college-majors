1334078,2,B00003XAMS,"This movie is bad even by Ed Wood standards! It somewhat borders the line of ""so bad it's good"" like Plan 9/Grave Robbers from Outer Space and Jail Bait and just so bad it's BAD! Essentially the story of a transvestite and his struggle for acceptance, it's filled with the usual ""Edwoodian"" trademarks as ham acting, atrocious dialougue (checkout the completely senseless jabbering of Bela Lugosi superimposed over a city street early on in the film. POOL ZE STRING! DANCE! SNAKES SNAILS AND PUUPY DOG TAILS! Whhhaaat???), and scenes that come and go without rhyme or reason. This was his first major feature, so it doesn't all hang together yet, but even fans will have a rough going with this! Good luck and hold on to your noses!",1074902400,,732,4.7265625
1334079,3,B00003XAMS,"As a connoisseur  of cult/bizarre films, I've seen some bad movies. If they're interesting enough, bad movies can be incredibly entertaining (i.e. Mystery Science Theater 3000). Even being familiar with Edward D. Wood's work (Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster) did not prepare for the experience of viewing his debut film, Glen or Glenda. Partially based on Wood's own life, the film was a serious attempt to dramatize the lifestyle of a man who is compelled to wear women's clothing. A disclaimer at the beginning proclaims it a film of ""stark realism"". What follows is 80 minutes of cinematic ineptitude, the likes of which I have never seen. There are plenty of bad films, but this movie is in a class by itself! Even Ed Wood's ""classic"" Plan 9 From Outer Space, often called the worst movie of all time, looks great in comparison to Glen or Glenda.
The film follows (occasionally) a man named Glen (Wood himself) who likes to wear women's clothing. He is engaged to a girl named Barbara (Dolores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend), but is distraught over whether to reveal his secret to her.
Wood's attempt at ""stark realism"" is destroyed immediately as soon as we see Bela Lugosi in a chair spouting incoherent nonsense (""Pull de string!"", ""Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys, puppy-dog tails and big fat snails"".)
Half the film consists of random stock footage that has no relevance to the material whatsoever. No to mention the absurd dream sequence that, I think, is supposed to represent Glen's confused state of mind, but it really makes no sense at all. It features half-clothed women dancing around for no reason, a torture scene (!!) and even an appearance by the devil (!!!). By this point, the audience is scratching their heads and wondering what the heck is going on. It really must be seen to be believed.
For fans of the director's work, Glen or Glenda is a must-see. Even though it's unbelievably terrible, the film is not without entertainment value. It has many laugh-out-loud moments, and the film overall is so bizarre that is should not be missed by cult movie fanatics.",1069718400,23,2143,4.791891891891892

1334083,5,B00003XAMS,"There is no trick to making a normal bad movie. Most of the movies out there are bad or boring, or both. The people involved generally know the movie isn't very good. They are film professionals who realize they haven't brought what is necessary to create a quality movie. It may be due to time or a lack of money to hire the best actors and script writers. It may be pressure to clone the latest box office smash and capitalize on it's success. Whatever the reason it isn't because the director is so inept, incompetent, foolish, and inexperienced that they think incoherent rambling makes a fine picture.
That is precisely why ""Glen or Glenda"" is a priceless gem. Ed Wood poured his heart and soul into what he considered a hard hitting drama to enlighten the masses about cross dressing men. A cross dresser himself, Wood even wore women's underwear under his uniform while in the military. He felt this movie would educate, inform, and bring a better understanding about cross dressing. He actually thought it was a great movie.
Of course what he made was a wildly incoherent mess, full of unrelated scenes and crazy dialog. The Bela Lagosi character, who is playing God, rambles about ""Pulling skrings"" while buffalos stampede across the screen. There are dream sequences where scantily clad women slink about while Wood stands offstage and looks ""Horrified"". It simply cannot be described and has nothing to do with the plot. In fact, nothing in the movie has anything to do with the plot. That in itself is a remarkable achievement.
""Glen or Glenda"" is a high water mark in bad movies. Along with ""Robot Monster"" and his own ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", it has stood the test of time to become an icon. Watch it and be amazed.",1022889600,18,1731,4.678688524590164
1334084,4,B00003XAMS,"Glen or Glenda is, of course, Edward D. Wood Jr.'s autobiographical exploitation anti-masterpiece. If you've already seen it and you're reading this, you're no doubt a fan. If you haven't seen it, let me try to describe the indescribable: imagine one of those creaky old 16mm Coronet instructional grade-school films, only about transvestism, featuring Bela Lugosi, and codirected by Bunuel and Warhol. When they were both twelve years old. Dizzingly absurd dialogue and imagery abound, intercut with dry clinical discussions of transvestism, transsexuality, and hermaphroditism, delivered in tones of heartfelt tolerence. What really amazes me is the guts it must have taken for Ed Wood to make this movie at all in the moral and political climate of the early 50s. Wow! I love the (autobiographical) part about the TV soldier going into battle with his ladies' undies on underneath his uniform! As noted by others, the ""lost"" scenes of bondage although they serve no real purpose and just slow the film down). This is one that really has to be seen to be believed; every bad film fan needs a copy of this in their collection.
Of course the question on every GoG fan's mind is: how's the print quality? I was curious myself, but wary of buying after reading a very negative review in Scarlet Street last year complaining about the quality of the source print. After viewing the disc, I am glad to report that overall it's quite acceptable, if not pristine. The worst of the damage amounts to a half dozen or so noticeable jump cuts, some sporadic scratching, and the usual light speckling throughout. Tonal values and detail range from very good to excellent throughout and the print is fairly sharp (if not as crisp as Image's Bride of the Monster transfer). The original ""Glen or Glenda"" title card has been cobbled together from freeze-frames (does no intact high-quality footage exist?), though Wade Williams has this time tastefully placed his copyright notice elsewhere. Despite the SS reviewer's claims that much better prints of the film are widely available on video, I've yet to run across one. This DVD easily blows away the numerous TV prints and VHS pre-records I've watched, owned, and rented over the years, including Rhino and Video Yesteryear's VHS editions. Large sections of the DVD are nearly blemish-free and the audio is clear. Extras include 16 chapter stops and a longer, cleaner trailer than I've seen before. Unless you're holding out for a truly flawless copy, I think this will do nicely for most viewers; I am not at all unhappy with the purchase.",1002672000,9,2577,4.967592592592593
1334085,4,B00003XAMS,"The dvd release (and presumably the vhs version as well, since both are from the same distributor) is the best presentation yet of Glen Or Glenda. Out of all the reviews that customers here have posted, they've all apparently missed something I just realized. A reviewer who wrote ""a close to 15-minutes long, totally unrelated, episodic dream sequence containing lots of women wearing lingerie while performing various acts (like one woman pouncing upon another woman, binding and gagging her), all to the tune of ""Czardas"", the most rushed piece of violin music ever, while Wood's dream ego looks horrifiedly at the proceedings"" was unaware of what that footage really is... There exists a famous reel of ""outtakes"" from the film, running about 5-6 minutes. That's what the footage is that the other reviewer described! Apparently, Wade Williams (who released this version on dvd) did a ""restoration"" of Glen Or Glenda and reinserted the footage at the appropriate point in the film (during Glen's dream/nightmare near the end). That also accounts for the difference in the running time between this release (68 minutes) and any other previous releases (generally 62 minutes). Fans of Ed Wood and this film in particular no longer have to search for the ""missing"" footage...it's all here on the dvd! I didn't realize this at first, until a friend who is a collector described the outtakes to me, and I remembered them from this dvd.

1334099,1,B00003XAMS,"After seeing PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, I wanted to see more ED WOOD films. GLEN OR GLENDA? seemed like a place to start. I have seen lots and lots of films in my life and this film has to be in the top 10% of bad and bizarre films. There is not much to praise in this rather off and somewhat purposeless film.

GLEN OR GLENDA? is billed as starring Bela Lugosi yet he has no place in the film. He sits in a chair surrounded by skeletons appearing like the host of a horror film show. His words often make no sense and seemingly no connection to the film. He talks on and on about dragons eating little boys. Is that a reference to men who want to be women? After Bela, we have a stern announcer trying to explain the idea of some men needing to dress as women. There is a pseudo-documentary approach for a while. Is this going to be a lesson in acceptance and an educational journey?

Ed Wood stars as Glen or is he Glenda? He actually is a pleasant looking man whose acting skills are not bad. I could imagine him as a comedic actor in the 40's but Ed Wood would eventually be known as the director of bad films. Wood's real-life girlfriend at the time, Dolores Fuller, also stands in as his girlfriend Barbara in the film. Here is someone who was miscast on all levels.

The story cuts back and forth from a scene of a police detective and a psychiatrist talking about the inner workings of a man wanting to dress like a woman. The detective genuinely seems concerned about ""transvestites"" and wants them to be safe in society. Again, there is an educational feel to part of this film that doesn't quite fit the story.

As Glen decides whether or not to share his ""secret"" with Barbara, a serious of bizarre scenes ensure. Odd images of beautiful women as seductresses or women being attacked by men or othe women. What on earth is going on here? There is no dialogue and it goes on for several minutes. Do things work out for Glen, Glenda and Barbara? You'll have to watch the film to see.

The film is divided into two segments. The second segment is much shorter and deals with a man who actually decides to become a woman through surgery. In his case, this desire is not just psychological but physiological. He is a pseudo-hermaphrodite. Externally he has male parts but internally he has not fully developed female parts. Although this segment is short, there is several minutes of stock footage of WWII images as our hero is drated as a male soldier.

Does any of this make any sense? It certainly does not and this film is so bad that it is not bad enough to be funny. It is actually painful to watch. If you want to see a ""good"" bad film, try Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.",1328659200,4,2687,4.300395256916996
1334100,5,B00003XAMS,"I have seen Plan 9 from Outer Space (and own a copy), but I have never seen any other Ed Wood film (other than Burton's film about his life, which is my favorite Burton film), so I decided to rent Wood's debut, which he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in (under a pseudonym), and it's every bit as hysterical (and as bad) as I thought it would be.

This film has some of the most incoherent, uneven editing I've ever seen in a motion picture.  The stuff comes out of left field that you're honestly flabbergasted at the incompetence of it all (the appearance of a ""native"" tribe and a small role for ""Satan"" are amongst the most ""amazing"" moments in the film).  When Lugosi appears on the screen (presumably playing God who crossdresses like a mad scientist), he's hysterically bad and hysterically out of place.  The acting is stiff and overdone, the ""message"" of tolerance is heavy handed and preachy as hell, the film takes itself so seriously (which is one of the reasons it's so funny), and the dream sequences are overbaked as hell.

Despite all this incompetence, Wood's film is watchable and hysterical, funnier than a lot of modern comedies.  And in Wood's defense, this film and its subject matter was damn risky for its time.  It was really ahead of its time, but it's so badly done that Wood's message of tolerance gets lost in the shuffle.

This is my favorite Ed Wood movie.  Even better (worse) than ""Plan Nine from Outer Space.""  Yes, it's one of those ""so bad, it's good"" movies.  If you want to fully appreciate this movie, do this.  First, imagine that it's the '50's and Ed Wood has been hired to produce a film the purpose of which is to explain to High School students the difference between transexuals, transvestites, and homosexuals.  Pretend the message of the film is ""let's be accepting of transexuals and transvestites because, hey, at least they're not homosexuals!""  (Remember, we're imagining it's the '50's.)  Okay, now drink 2 beers.  Now, start the film.  Enjoy.

1334102,3,B00003XAMS,"On the one hand from just a movie viewing standpoint?  Horrible.  Even being as old as it is, I am pretty sure that a teen back then with the crude home film making equipment available to them could have done as good - or better.  And yet on the 5 star scale I still have to give it the 3.  Why?

Well - it's honest.  Yes it has some obscure scenes.  Some poorly delivered lines.  But it's still a brutally honest story at its core.  It's a topic that would have been so controversial for its time that for many it is STILL a controversial and uncomfortable topic today.  In that sense, it was pretty dang brave to make, even if some had exploitative reasons for making it - Ed Wood didn't, and it shows.  Whatever those who supported him expected, he surely didn't deliver what they wanted and instead kept it as real as possible.

Still don't confuse my use of the words honest and real for coherent.  It's not that.  It's all over the place.  It's partly some campy B movie (Bela Lugosi the scientist and his strings), part PSA / 50s school movie (the doctor in his office explaining to a cop just what it means to be a transvestite), and part some soap opera as it follows several men (though mainly Glen) in their attempts to be accepted for who they are.",1280793600,3,1260,4.279661016949152
1334103,3,B00003XAMS,"""Glen or Glenda"" is a one-of-a-kind movie.  Not what I call good or bad, just one-of-a-kind.  I had my first exposure with Ed Wood on films such as ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but never did I see his earliest film until now.  This is definitely his most personal work, as well as his most bizarre.

The movie deals with the complications of accepting one's odd behavior among a prejudice society, the odd behavior being one's desire to wear women's clothing.  Bela Lugosi narrated in an unorthodox fashion, making vague and unrelated comments that mostly don't make any sense (but he sounded cool saying them) as well as being the initiator of one's desires.  Within the story, it introduced a counselor who thinks this is an educational video, because he sure enunciated all of the basic details about homosexuals, transvestites, and the differences between them.  He discussed with a detective about the tragedy of one cross-dresser, and then he introduced the central character, Glen (or Glenda).  Glen's about to get marriage, but he didn't tell his fianc about his other self.  He feared that his pleasure in wearing dresses might compromise their relationship, but he can't hide it forever.  Thus, it became a challenge for Glen to reveal his idiosyncratic behavior.

The movie was simple enough in fleshing out Glen and his inner trials...up until the movie reached the 40-minute mark.  And then for the next 10 minutes, ""Glen or Glenda"" went totally crazy with all the suggestive and confusing imagery.  It's a good thing I had some experience with feature-length&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/metaphorical/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">metaphorical</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/nightmares/dp/B0000AK80C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">nightmares</a>, so I got the handle on metaphors enough to make a personal interpretation on what this screwy sequence entailed.  The attractive yet hefty woman dancing around reflects Glen exposing his wild self.  The same woman committing BDSM on a random woman reflects Glen having full control of his particular self, as well as proving he has just as much strength in his femininity as any woman.  The narrator (Lugosi) watched these scenes in a straight face, perceiving everything that Glen tried to hide.  The 'Big Green Dragon' that the narrator mentioned is only a name, not a description, for the satanic being who's haunting Glen; technically, he has red skin, but that name only reflects simple irony in association with Glen's gender-bender desires. The civilians were pointing fingers at him with great shame, leading to what he thought was a metempsychosis, but the Dragon tricked him and the 'judges' continued to point their fingers, bringing Glen to face his inhibitions. Finally, as for the puppy dog tails and the snails...I guess Ed Wood was hungry.

I have to say, that was a pretty clever sequence.  Either that, or I haven't a clue as to what went on; sometimes, I can't tell what Ed Wood's really thinking.  But when it comes to the technical aspects of the film, he's an easy read.  This is patented Ed Wood material: the stages and sets are notably cheap (love the notecard glued on top of a real newspaper heading), it's poorly edited, the actors are stiff and has lousy delivery, and there's a lot of obvious padding during transitions.  Simply put, this movie is really, REALLY atrociously made.  No surprise here from the publicly-viewed worst filmmaker of the golden age of cinema.

If one were to judge only by the production values of the film, then yes, ""Glen or Glenda"" is awful.  But once I look away all the technical atrocities and focusing on the core of the film, I kinda have to admire it.  Ed Wood had ambition, and he showed it in this film.  He didn't show it well, and just to nitpick, the film could've been more complete had it removed the subplot with the hermaphrodite named Allen, but the film is definitely bold and unique.  That is more than I can say about the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/cop-out-sequels/dp/B0006D3HEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">cop-out sequels</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/cheap-knock-offs/dp/B0039UT3M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">cheap knock-offs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soulless-products/dp/B002U1LGTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soulless products</a>&nbsp;after it, and with that, I approve Ed Wood for making an effort  Or at least tried.",1280620800,2,4641,5.744152046783626

Infamous movie that began Ed Wood's reign as ""worst director of all time"" is an autobiographic semi-documentary on transvestism (now called ""crossdressing""). Wood as Glen also boldly appears in his second self, here named Glenda. Fuller, playing girlfriend Barbara, is a really bad actress. Bela's ""puppy dog's tails"" speech and later ""Pull da string! Pull da string!"" narration over a superimposed buffalo herd are unforgettable. An extended sequence of wordless action with music track perhaps reveals the director's other idiosyncracies.

Here, as Glen and Barbara get married, a sports jacketed Satan nods his approval. The next curious segment is of an hourglass shaped stripper then a supine woman being whipped and bound by another girl. The previously tied up girl freely writhes on a couch in a sheer negligee, clearly aroused. A man enters and forces himself upon her; at first she resists but then kisses him back. All this as Lugosi watches with raised brows.

The sequence continues: a small crowd points accusingly at Glen and surround him as the devil urges them forward. He's now Glenda when they back away. Barbara slowly approaches but suddenly turns into Satan. Glenda recoils. An amused Barbara reappears in an overturned chair; she rises and mocks Glenda. A montage of laughers, plus their hands and grinning faces, segues to the devil repeating Lugosi's ""Beware"" soliloquy.

All this is preface to Glen's decision to reveal his dark secret to Barbara. Will she laugh for real and make Glen's nightmare a reality? Will she end their engagement? Before we find out, another case is presented plus there's lots more stock footage to use up! (Hint: Wood's story incorrectly concludes that love cures CDers.)",1276214400,,1974,5.591973244147157

It is so stupifyingly bad that it's a real classic. It's like a prehistoric LSD trip in black & white. Especially the part when all of the people are at the apartment (along with the devil) tormenting Glen/Glenda. Some people slowly appear out of nowhere, others pop in instantaneously.

In the 1950s or 60s or 70s, cross-dressers, gays, and other 'deviants' were NEVER portrayed as either sympathetic characters or as being in any way normal.  Yet, Ed Wood, drawing from his own life, with support from his friends and associates, made a movie about men whose sexuality was DIFFERENT, yet who were otherwise quite typical people - the mailman, the steel worker, the soldier, the guy who works for the electric company.  The struggle Glen goes through to tell his fiance about his cross-dressing will certainly be a familiar one to anyone who's had a coming-out story of their own.  Wood got the emotions spot-on right.

There are sequences in this movie of overt sexuality, sexual fantasy, and s&m - This from a time when Ricky and Lucy slept in separate beds!

Yeah, the acting is stilted, the stock footage is inane, the camera work is often jarring, and the narration technique is dated.

Then I wondered: was GLEN OR GLENDA really that bad?

Yes.  And more.  Or worse, depending on how you measure these things.

If you know nothing about Ed Wood and his inept film career, you will be completely lost and mystified by how bad this movie is.  Even if you understand Wood and his career, GLEN OR GLENDA is astonishingly bad in so many ways.  You will see transvestites in the 1950s, along with Bela Lugosi, stock footage of stampeding buffalo, and Satan.  Behind it all is a disjointed script justifying cross-dressing while inserting bizarre sequences where unidentified women tie each other up or rip their clothes off themselves.  And then Satan shows up to do stuff.

Wow.  It's bad.  It's beyond bad, which is probably why it's survived.  I don't think anyone could have TRIED to make a worse movie.  Anyone who's studied psychology should have fun with this as well as those who enjoy really, really bad filmmaking.

1334119,5,B00003XAMS,"Passport Video presents ""The Bela Lugosi Box - 15 Frightful Films"" (1942) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Bla Lugosi was the stage name of actor Bla Ferenc Dezs' Blask (October 20, 1882 - August 16, 1956) --- Lugosi was born in Lugos, Hungary, at the time part of Austria-Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania), the youngest of four children of a baker --- best known for his portrayal of ""Dracula"" in the American Broadway stage production, and subsequent film, of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story.

Late in his life, he again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ""GLEN OR GLENDA?"" (1953) (in which his role made no more sense than the rest of the movie) and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (1955), during post-production of the latter, Lugosi entered treatment for his addiction, and the premier of the film was ostensibly intended to help pay for his treatment expenses. The extras on an early DVD release of ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" (1959) include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center, which provide some rare personal insights into the man --- this was one of Lugosi's most infamous roles was released after he was dead. Ed Wood (Director) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double --- Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project --- Wood later conceived of Plan 9, Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots --- notice however the ""double"" is thinner than Lugosi, and covers the lower half of his face with his cape in every shot --- Leonard Maltin (Famous Film Critic) was quoted - ""Lugosi died during production, and it shows.""

Lugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 while lying in bed in his Los Angeles home. He was 73 --- Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of the many capes from the Dracula stageplay, as per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California --- Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his famous cloak; Bela Lugosi, Jr. has confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, arrived at their decision independently.

1334121,1,B00003XAMS,"There are two reasons why I watched this film:

1) Because it is included in ""The Ed Wood Box"" set, which has much more enjoyable films (even though they're all bad).

2) Because the Tim Burton film ""Ed Wood"" includes the making of ""Glen or Glenda?"" as a part of its plot, and it is great to see how close they got when they showed Johnny Depp, Sarah Jessica Parker and Martin Landau imitating scenes from the film.

There are a couple good moments, like when Bela Lugosi shouts ""PULL THE STRING! PULL THE STRING!!"" But the story's narrative is incredibly jumbled, the dialogue poor, and everything about it is barely watchable. It is still amazing that this film even got made. If you think ""Plan 9"" or ""Bride of the Monster"" are bad films, watch ""Glen or Glenda?"" and you'll think the other Wood films are Shakespeare.",1145318400,4,820,4.527027027027027
1334122,5,B00003XAMS,"If ever there were a film to so effectively use generic and stock actors, wardrobe, sets, and footage, I do not know what it is.  Ed Wood once again takes about $30 and manages to cobble together something so sensationally stupid and occassionally sidesplitting (and come on, how many directors do you know of who can pull off a ""sidesplitting"" edit like the Buffalo shot?)that it really feels brilliant at times.  You just have to give Ed Wood an A for effort for being so passionate about making a movie that he made Glen or Glenda.  I think this movie is very much safe within the ""so bad its good"" range and nowhere near the ""so bad its bad"" area.

I'd reccommend going ahead and buying the box set of Ed Wood movies, and at least seeing the Tim Burton movie about Ed Wood.",1141689600,3,777,4.375

1334124,1,B00003XAMS,"Numerous film critics have given Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" the dubious disinction of being the worst movie ever made.  One wonders how those same critics could have possibly overlooked this.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is Oscar winning material when compared to ""Glen or Glenda.""  Unlike Wood's other films, this movie is so awful it is not even funny.  The subject matter is transvestism starring Wood himself (a transvestite in real life) and Bela Lugosi.  The latter's role in this movie is anybody's guess.  The most inept use of stock footage in cinematic history occurs when Lugosi is trying to instill fear in the audience and the scene cuts to a stampede of buffalo!  What makes this film so unbearable is just how much it drags on in no particular direction. It is just over an hour long but feels as though it is three times in length.  Amazingly, the censors in the early 50's did not quash this movie given its content.  Had they done so, they would have done humanity an enormous favor.  Do not, under any circumstances, purchase or even rent this movie (a total waste of money.)  Not even die hard Ed Wood fans should watch it.",1127001600,5,1150,4.588235294117647
1334125,4,B00003XAMS,"What makes Glen or Glenda a bad film is the mind of its maker. There can be no more direct and incendiary case made against the madness that is cross-dressing. The problem is not that people do it or that they enjoy it, but that they need to justify it to the rest of the world. This basic flaw inhabited Ed Wood's entire career and destroyed him. You can see it time and time again in his other films, but none more clearly than this plaintive cry for help. Its sad and stupid at the same time. What makes it sad is to see someone's private life twisted inside out into something that is suppose to be art. With the release of Tim Burton's Ed Wood on DVD (a genius film) there will be renewed interest in this man. But, let's remember, he died broke, alcoholic, making pornography, and a sad sad laughing stock. Ed Wood wasn't just the worst director of all time, he might have also been one of the world's most misguided and deluded people as well. Watch Glen or Glenda and laugh, but you will also feel a sad for this twisted wreck.",1119571200,2,1035,4.258883248730965
1334126,4,B00003XAMS,"I'll try not to repeat what Amazon reviewers have already said about this film.  Were it a minute longer, it would be unbearable for even a single viewing.  But as it stands, ""Glen or Glenda"" is worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and consequently more enjoyable (it's also shorter).  Three additional points about the film:

1.  Ed Wood has the magnified ""didactic"" sensibility of a preacher or compulsive rhetorician.  His primary mode of development is repetition.  The story never gets under way because Ed keeps announcing the ""premise"" of his movie, postponing the impossible challenge of telling a story on film.  In effect, we never get beyond the title.  Not only his voice-over narration but his manipulation of stock footage and use of non-narrative montage mark him as the ultimate cinematic huckster or pitch man.

2.  Ed's choice of scenes tells us virtually nothing about ""Glen"" but probably reveals a lot about Ed.  From the World War II footage to strip-tease and B&D scenes (mild) Ed shows that he's a ""slightly"" deviant, cross-dressing heterosexual but sufficiently ""alternative"" to have empathy for transsexuals. He's also clearly an individual who has struggled with his share of desires and demons.

3.  However bad, the film must be judged daring for a 1953 film, a time when the word ""virgin"" and even ""sex"" was taboo on the screen. (The film even discusses and represents homosexuality.)  Moreover, apart from the treatment, Ed's choice of subject matter insures the film will be taken with more than a little seriousness by viewers who share Ed's urges and interests.  In that respect, ""Glen or Glenda?"" is more ""relevant"" than ever, since I can't think of any other commercial movie that approaches the same subject as head-on as this one.  In fact, most gender-bender movies, from ""Some Like It Hot"" to ""The Bird Cage,"" are far more exploitive of their subject matter than is Ed Wood.  Make no mistake: he's clearly a man on a mission.",1118793600,13,1964,4.935975609756097
1334127,1,B00003XAMS,"Ed Wood films have a tendency to be bad enough that they are actually funny to watch. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is just such an example. Glen or Glenda is not.

Unlike the title character, this moview never quite figures out what it wishes to be. It comes across sometimes as a bad documentary, sometimes as a drama of human conflict, sometimes as an allegory of good and evil. It makes all these attempts and fails miserably in each of them.

Put your money into something entertaining, educational or inspiring. This isn't it.",1113436800,5,528,4.6063829787234045
1334128,5,B00003XAMS,"You know, I thought this was a very good movie.  Sure, it was utterly, and I mean the word utterly, horrible in the sense of production, acting, and even direction, but the mind of Ed Wood Jr. was not meant to be understood in the 1950s, but for some strange reason really worked well in today's society.  I mean, look at this film.  Glen and Glenda was not a huge success in the 50s causing Ed Wood to be considered one of the worst directors out there at the time, but look at this film.  It is about transsexuals, transvestites, and sex change operations.  These were topics not discussed in modern cinema at the time.  In fact, I don't know of any that dealt with this issue.  Wood opened the door.  He talks, he thinks, he expresses his feelings into this film, and the final result may seem a bit Mystery Science Theater 3000-ish, but the honest truth is that it works so well in today's society.  Throughout this entire film I couldn't help laughing, not just at the poor production and the scene where Glen's fiance gives him her sweater, but also that this type of story is happening today.  There are people that deal with situations like this all the time in our modern society.

This had me thinking, was this just a cheap film for Ed Wood Jr., or was it nothing short of brilliant.  Here we have a director who created a film well before its time that was not understood when it was released, but somehow really really works today.  Think about it for a second.  Here you have this man, who loves to dress as a woman, but is afraid because of what society may think.  We have those issues now.  There are so many ""closeted"" homosexuals in our society that are afraid to be themselves because of what others may think.  Glen feels this.  He experiences it with his own fiance, a woman that is supposed to love him no matter what issues come across their table.  Then there is Alan, a GI for all things, which comes back from the war, and wants to be a woman.  This is wild.  When I was watching this, my mind was being blown away.  Remember the headline news years back about gays in the military?  Perhaps everyone should be watching this film.  I never knew a film like this existed.  It has been a long time since I have seen Tim Burton's film about Ed Wood, but now I want to revisit it.

Now, I will admit, there were some scenes that just screamed cheesy B-rated film.  Bela Lugosi's entire part in this film was absurd.  The fact that he was a scientist, trying to talk about the changes in our society and how they are affecting people like Glen, was interesting, but difficult to take in noting Lugosi's deep accent.  BEEEVAAARE.  HA!  That still has me laughing two days after watching the film.  But, it isn't laughter of disgust.  It is laughter of enjoyment.  There was a huge level of enjoyment to this film.  It is short movie, so Wood gets straight to the point, interrupting for just a brief moment to have this wildly sexual dance in the middle.  This film reminded me of some of Christopher Guest's very early styled mocu-mentaries.  Sure, Wood didn't have the money to make an elaborate picture.  He used stock footage and voice-overs half the time.  You could tell that budget was low because he was in it as the title character (I think that also had something to do with his interest in the subject), but for me it worked.

Overall, this was a very humorous and eye opening film.  For those that comment on how dated the story is, I don't know.  I really think that Wood's film has so much to offer today's society.  While not all the facts are correct, he was brave enough to make a film about it.  Who else was going to do that in the 50s ... oh, when times were ""better""?  I stand-up and applaud Wood for this film and really suggest everyone going out and experiencing this one for the first time.  It is enjoyable, sinful, and jaw dropping all at the same time.  I am surprised that Wood's time machine didn't show up in this film somewhere along the line, because it was as if he was looking directly into our society.  It was bizarrely beautiful.  I loved it.

Thank you Mr. Wood!

1334131,5,B00003XAMS,"Ed Wood's continuing reign as the so-called 'worst director of all time' has earned him many fans, but it has also done his work a disservice: few reviewers dare to go against the tide and write constructively about his movies, preferring instead to hop in the so-bad-it's-good bandwagon. This is unfortunate, because his most interesting films are worthy of critical scrutiny - especially his first project, 'Glen or Glenda' (1953). Whereas most of his other films tackle a specific genre, this movie creates its own: an unlikely but personal blend of documentary and fiction, horror, romance, police procedural, and more. There isn't a single storyline throughout but rather a set of imbricated tales that feed off of each other. The bulk of the narrative is devoted to a couple of case histories which are recounted by a psychiatrist to an inspector, but the film is frequently punctuated by Lugosi's enigmatic character. His 'Scientist' name, much like an early scene in which he prepares a potion, is a nod to his past roles: he is a Demiurge-like figure whose utterances often have anthropogonic connotations and can affect people's lives. Lugosi's performance in this film is quite underrated, and arguably one of his most effective. (He was not quite as memorable in Wood's subsequent 'Bride of the Monster' [1955].) To further complicate the narrative, one of the two case histories related by the psychiatrist - that of Wood himself - features an elaborate dream sequence whose images are suitably bizarre and full of strange symbols. The film always operates on multiple levels at once, since Wood constantly shifts between characters while using a proliferation of contrasting techniques (voice-over, documentary, fiction, stock footage, image juxtapositions, etc.). Some have deemed this cinematic cacophony confusing and/or confused, but I find it fascinating, and sometimes even mesmerizing - this is automatic, stream of consciousness filmmaking that remains stubbornly indifferent to conventions. I strongly recommend this film to adventurous cinephiles.",1090022400,5,2071,5.414860681114551
1334132,3,B00003XAMS,"Normally I'd give films 1 or 2 for something that was terrible and that I didn't like. Ed Wood however is an exception. His films are bad but so bad they're good. Basically I could tell you all of what the other reviewers have said here. But I won't other than to say that I got this DVD really cheap in Tower Records ( 6 ) and I can say that this really was cheap entertainment. Lugosi's role in this is somewhat silly given that the film doesn't know whether it wants to be a genuine film or a shockumentary! And in some ways that's part of it's charm while it harms the whole process. It gives Lugosi the chance to spew wannabe crypto mumbo jumbo. In a way, he doesn't really "" pull ze strings "" so much as cut them off from him.
But give credit to Ed on this. This was a genuine attempt at trying to be risque and his heart was really in this and you can tell that - it just didn't translate as well as it could have. His real life fiance Dolores is in this and well.....she's not exactly a great actress. But in some ways the script is just embarassingly naive on Ed's part that in some ways you just can't really believe in it at all no matter how much heart was put into this.
Another thing you'll notice is the dubbing and it is pretty poor. There's a clear 1 and a half second delay on everyone's speech which can be amusing. In fact some people will be in hysterics and just take the piss out of it

In this film you can learn all types of words like 'transsexual', 'homosexual', 'bisexual', and 'hermaphodite'.

7919563,3,B00003XAMS,"Part infomercial, part confessional, part comedy, and part chiller, Glen or Glenda? is pretty much entertaining in every corner. However, what seems to irk many viewers is the contradictory way in which Ed Wood presents his movie: with straightforward seriousness and askew campiness. Unfortunately, this split personality approach results in an uneven rhythm. The lead role (played by Ed Wood himself) and the parts played by the other cast members fall short of being convincing in the acting department, so, along with the changing rhythm, the viewer is left wondering if this film was intended to be some kind of joke. It's possible that Wood wasn't too sure of what angle he wanted to take, since cross-dressing and transsexualism were early 50's taboo, so he went with two approaches: matter-of-fact and with-a-wink.

Glen or Glenda? is a bit unusual and sometimes a bit too bizarre for its own good, but that's just one of the qualities that keeps it entertaining. Depending upon your point of view, these scenes may either leave you in the dark or give you the opportunity to speculate with some smile-inducing curiosity. One may wonder what the feck Bela Lugosi is doing in the film, but my supposition is that Wood had a soft spot in his heart for Lugosi and wanted to include him in any way he could, so he did, much to the bafflement of the viewer.

Critics and reviewers alike have dubbed Glen or Glenda? ""the worst film ever made"", but its only real flaws are choppy editing and an uneven rhythm. If you've seen enough movies, you'll know that titling it as ""the worst"" is purely an exaggeration. It's unique, auteurish, amusing, and rarely gets dull.",1468281600,,1665,4.838596491228071

7919571,3,B00003XAMS,"Ed Wood was to film making what Marv Throneberry was to baseball, the best at being the worst at their profession. Yet like ""Marvelous"" Marv Ed Wood has a cult following of fans who love him for the awfulness of his movies. It is easy to see why. While Woods' movies are bad his love of movies come through his work. One of his best (or worst however you want to look at it) movies is ""Glen Or Glenda"", Ed Woods look into the transgender community. Made in the 1950's cross-dressing and sex change operations were not the kind of subject matter you found in films and if you did find a character who was transgendered in a movie back then they were usually portrayed as some kind of crazed, insane maniac. They certainly were not looked upon with sympathy much less understanding about their situation. That however is how Ed Woods approaches the subject matter in ""Glen Or Glenda"". No doubt the fact this movie dealt with something Ed Wood knew all too well, he was a cross-dresser in real life, most likely gave him the inspiration to try to present the subject in an understanding way.

Of course the problem with Ed Woods' movie is that Ed Wood made it. Wrote the script as well which explains some of the worst dialog you will ever hear spoken in a movie. Then of course there is the acting if you want to call it that led by Bela Lugosi who is the narrator spurting out lines about ""bevare"" of big green dragons who eat little boys, puppy-dog tails and fat snails and a couple of points in the movie yelling ""pull the string, PULL THE STRING""! Acting under the name Daniel Davis, Ed Wood himself is the star of the movie and he shows he is no slouch at being a bad actor either.

So at this point you are probably wondering why you should watch such a bad movie after all I, as well as others, have written so far. Well you should because this movie is a classic case of a film sooooooooo bad it is good. So hokey it is hip. So awful it is awsome. Plus while the talent in front of as well as behind the camera is bad the subject matter of transgenderism is presented fairly well. At the time ""Glen Or Glenda"" was made Christine Jorgensen, formerly George Jorgensen, was making headlines on her sex change operation which captivated the nation. The story line in the film looks at two individuals. One a man, named Glen, who is in love with his fiance but also just as much in love with her angora sweater trying to decide how to come out to her about his cross-dressing. The other story tells about a WW 2 vet who comes home from the war in Europe and faces his decision to have a series of operations that will make him a woman. Very loosely based on the life of one Christine Jorgensen. Both characters are treated with dignity and factual as their stories of their different degrees of gender varient are told. That just might be the one saving grace about ""Glen Or Glenda"" that can make this worthwhile to watch reguardless how bad in general the movie may be.

 Of course if you are the type of person who can not see the point of watching bad films and loving it there is nothing I or anyone else can say that will change your mind. If you are a fan of and love bad movies well here is one for you that you are bound to love. Now will someone please go and ""pull the string""!!!",1364083200,,3290,4.284565916398714
