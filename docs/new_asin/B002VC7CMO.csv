8381884,5,B002VC7CMO,"It is sad that the LDS church has made marriage something that is so protected that they won't allow families to be a part of it. Why cannot the church at least allow a civil marriage followed by a temple marriage.

The stories in this film touched me deeply. My heart aches for these people.

The film is well done and informative.",1300752000,2,332,4.338709677419355
8381885,5,B002VC7CMO,"This documentary is long overdue.

For years ""Shadow Mormons"" (still-practicing non-believers) have suffered in silence rather than incurring the consequences of publicly admitting their doubts and disbelief in Mormonism. As former BYU Professor and Mormon Arza Evans articulated the problem in his classic white paper, ""Families Held Hostage"":

""At first, the concept and slogan ""families can be together forever"" may sound like a harmless, romantic notion; but in reality it is perhaps the most controlling and stifling doctrine taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It effectively creates fear of ostracism, closes minds, and regulates personal behavior. Questions about this and other Church doctrine can cause serious family problems including divorce.""

Or as one Shadow Mormon powerfully cried out on an ExMormon discussion board:

""To those of you on the outside reading this, I beg you, please do not forget us. Please remember the hundreds of thousands of unique, special, beautiful individuals that are currently serving life sentences in the prison of Mormonism. Please do not cease to pray; to whatever God you serve, for our deliverance. Some of us have no hope for redemption or liberation. For the greater good, we willingly sacrifice our souls upon the altar of conformity and orthodoxy. Our pain is real. Our sentence is absolute.""

Through this video Shadow Mormons (many appear literally in shadow, some with altered audio in this DVD) have a voice - their story is compelling, heart breaking, provocative, and moving.

I recommend this video to anyone who is interested in Mormonism to any degree, to those are who are Mormons, or to anyone who is contemplating leaving the LdS Church. However, I especially recommend it to any Shadow Mormon who is trying to find a way to open up a discussion with others.

I believe that this DVD can be a powerful force for good both within and without Mormonism if it is used appropriately, respectfully, and wisely.
