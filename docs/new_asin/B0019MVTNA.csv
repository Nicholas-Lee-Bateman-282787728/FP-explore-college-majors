8274735,1,B0019MVTNA,"Potential buyers of this title, beware, the quality is terrible. I have an old vhs copy of this film which blows away this dvd. I think somebody pinned up a white sheet projected a faded, scratched, spliced, 8mm film on to it, and then filmed it with a 1980's era video camera. It is a shame that there are those who will try to sell such decrepid transfers to film buffs trying to get a good copy of films they enjoy. For now I will just hang on to my old vhs, hopefully someone will bring this title out in a respectable transfer.",1215648000,11,532,4.174757281553398
