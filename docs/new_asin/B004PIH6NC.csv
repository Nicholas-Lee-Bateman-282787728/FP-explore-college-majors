The language/  interpreter was extremely difficult to understand EVEN in English. It was interesting to watch but I couldn't stand more than five minutes of it with the interpreter and no subtitles to help understand what is being said.

Honestly, if you don't know the first thing about this type of martial arts, you shouldn't get this DVD. It would be great for someone who has been doing this for several years and know the art well but it's definitely NOT for beginners. On the back of the DVD box it even says ""great for beginners"", don't be fooled. If you want to watch how this martial art is done, this DVD is great but for learning it, it's a big fat NO.",1349136000,,773,4.287671232876712

The quality is great...........If you don't train in Capoeira I don't recommend this because you will not understand the movements and may hurt yourself! .....Also you could find better toturials on youtube honestly.........Good Luck

This video has helped me with hand and food placement, making more advance movements in capoeria much easier and less of a strain on the body. Thanks to the makers of this dvd.",1323561600,2,264,4.3
