7994014,2,B00009XENQ,"Captain Video was one fo the first (1949) television hits. It had a zero budget (they filmed next to a department store and borrowed props minutes before televising, the scripts were nonsense and nearly incoherent, the uniforms were army surplus, 15 minutes of live action were followed by a grade ""D"" movie serial that had nothing to do with Captain Video, etc.) but it was popular with those who were enjoying the novelty of their new television sets. These are the only remaining kinescopes of this series (The Dumont Network junked everything in their warehouses). To see how crude early television was, see this but don't expect to be entertained.",1172448000,3,652,4.9363636363636365
