2326021,5,B0009W5IRE,"I bought this video for my son's birthday, and he's been watching it every single day--sometimes more than once a day!

With a run-time of 48 minutes, Max and Ruby's Halloween features 6 episodes:

MAX'S HALLOWEEN

Max wants to be a vampire for Halloween, but Ruby needs a little prince to match her Cinderella costume. Will max choose the tricks over the treats?

RUBY'S LEAF COLLECTION

One fall day, Ruby asks Max to help with her Leaf Collection Book. Max loves collecting leaves--maybe a little too much!

THE BLUE TARANTULA

Max wants Ruby to read him the tale of ""The Blue Tarantula"". Will the scary story keep her brother up all night?

RUBY'S PANDA PRIZE

At the fair, Ruby really wants to win a panda prize. But will Max's jellyball obsession get in the way?

RUBY'S ROLLER SKATES

Ruby needs to practice so that she can roller-skate to Grandma's house, but Max's tow truck game keeps getting in the way.

GHOST BUNNY

The Bunny Scouts can't tell their scary campfire story until Ruby gets Max to sleep. But Max wants to hear the scary story...and make it scarier, too!

I'm really not sure what it is about Max & Ruby that enthralls my son so much. In an era of CGI animation, snazzy songs, and fast-paced action, he consistently watches his other Max & Ruby DVD, and now, this video. Ruby is gently bossy, trying to get Max to do what she wants. Max, of course, has his own ideas! (And like my husband asked me the other day ""Where in the world is the mother in this series?"")

But my son really enjoys Max & Ruby and it's great that parents and caregivers won't have to worry about innuendo, MTV-paced sequences, shrillness or meanness with these characters.",1127779200,,1671,4.560402684563758

They are so dear and funny; when my little one asks to watch Max and Ruby, she gets no qualms from me!

If you are looking for a sweet, gentle, entertaining program for your child, I highly, highly recommend Max and Ruby.

My older daughter has always loved all of  Rosemary Wells's  (the creator of M&R) books and now my little one is following suit.

If you'd like to check out another of her books, try ""Shy Charles.""  One of our favorites.

Kids stop, sit and watch what's going on.  There is always some cute lesson to learn.  Max seems to turn the tables on his big sister Ruby and she never sees it coming.  We love the calming effect of Max and Ruby videos.  Sterling Hts Mom",1163203200,,397,4.3561643835616435

2326077,5,B0009W5IRE,"My 3-year-old daughter loves Max & Ruby. The somewhat patient big sister, Ruby, spends her time with friends and Bunny Scouts, while her little brother, Max, spends HIS time finding ways to cause mischief. Based on books by Rosemary Wells, these short stories are fun, sweet, and gentle viewing for small children.

The DVDs have an auto-play function, which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child. The show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than 30 seconds or so. When the episodes are all played out, it goes back to the menu and restarts.

While TV/DVDs should not be used as alternatives to good parenting, the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home.

I HIGHLY recommend ""Max & Ruby"" of any title. They are all wonderful. [My husband even gets a kick out of Max's antics.]

2326083,5,B0009W5IRE,"I bought my 3 1/2 yr old this DVD about a month ago, and she LOVED it, so I also bought the other 2 Max and Ruby DVDs (the Christmas and Easter ones), and she also loves those.  And the theme of the holiday featured is only on one or two of the many episodes on the DVD, so they are definitely year-round watching.  It is a good value for the amount of shows here.  The show is about Ruby and her little brother Max, and all shows feature them.  Sometimes Ruby's friend is on an episode, sometimes their grandma from down the street, but no parents, just the brother and sister, and they get along wonderfully.  Ruby is so sweet and patient to her little brother, which is a good example for my daughter.  The show is sweet and slow paced with easy plots for little ones to follow.  I would say the age range would be 15 months to 4 years.  This show is 100% for children, though, so it doesn't have the appeal another sweetly paced show, Kipper, that adults would enjoy too (I highly recommend you check out Kipper), but Ruby and Max is truly enjoyed by my little one and is a good investment.

(Along with Max and Ruby and Kipper, I also recommend Maggie and the Ferocious Beast-- very sweet too!)",1128643200,4,1199,4.246696035242291
