8700095,5,B00T1XIY8C,"This is a fun grade B adventure series from the 90s.  Don't expect great visuals - technology has moved so far beyond the production techniques of older series like this it can be a real disappointment if you aren't prepared for it.  However, if you grew up watching this on late-night TV, its a really fun retro trip to watch again!  I won't include a summary of the actual story lines of Highlander here, they can be found readily on-line.  So, set your expectations in accordingly and enjoy!",1508284800,,494,4.579545454545454
