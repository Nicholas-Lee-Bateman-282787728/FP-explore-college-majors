If you just enjoy watching great scenery and seeing many familiar faces, it's worth getting.  I have the Due South series but that was the only repeat for me.
My favorite of the other movies is Rugged Gold, a story that reminds me of Silence of the North that starred Tom Skerritt & Ellen Burstyn.  The other movies are very watchable with actors including Graham Greene, William Smith (as a bad guy of course!), Dan Haggerty, Mickey Rooney, Bo Hopkins and more.",1444435200,4,595,4.5327102803738315
