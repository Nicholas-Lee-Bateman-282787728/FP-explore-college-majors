8259371,4,B0015PC7GE,"It was great to receive these rare full-episode DVDs of Trading Spaces, but I question whether these were ever ""viewer's choice"" favorites. While the packaging shows Paige Davis, these episodes were actually hosted by her predecessor, Alex McLeod, which means all five episodes were actually from the very first season. They really hadn't worked out all of the kinks until Banyan took over in season two, and Paige replaced Alex.

We always loved Trading Spaces, which outweighed these shortcomings when we were watching, but it did feel a bit like a bait-and-switch. These might have been the ""best of"" Alex's episodes, but certainly not the ""best of"" Trading Spaces.",1293494400,2,668,5.128440366972477
