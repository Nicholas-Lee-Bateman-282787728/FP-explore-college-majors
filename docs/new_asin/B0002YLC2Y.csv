2146154,4,B0002YLC2Y,"I would have given this a five star but the Disney company hasn't completed a Power Ranger Series EVER!  I buy all the time collections of entire series on older TV shows than the Power Rangers, but they only produce a limited bunch of episodes.  SPD 3/4, Dino Thunder 3/4, Mystic Force 2/4 (I think), Jungle Fury 1/4 (again I think, they only did two DVDs on this series).  And they haven't even done any DVDs of the older series of Power Rangers; MMPR, Turbo, Zeo, Space, Lost Galaxy.  Yeah they did some Lightspeed Rescue and Wild Force on VHS but they haven't brought those the DVDs.  And until they do I won't be happy with purchasing the Power Rangers episodes.",1276300800,2,667,4.479338842975206
