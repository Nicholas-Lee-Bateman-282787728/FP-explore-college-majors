137610,5,0792199405,"Video transfer:  I'm impressed.  Most scenes are crisp and detailed with surprisingly limited compression artifacts.  A few evening and night scenes are overly dark but I'm confident it was the original source material, not the transfer.  Audio is mono and somewhat frequency limited but that's 1957-1958 technology.
Stories, acting, misc.:
The bad:  Stories are occasionally weak; characters are sometimes unbelievable.  Some acting is marginal; some plots are corny.  In the 50s, those were the norm!
The good: The series often shines.  Richard Boone, when at his best, is magnificent.  Some storylines are inspired.  Costuming and sets frequently made me feel this was part documentary.  The show's challenge of 50s America norms on racism and [sex] deserves loud applause.
Summary: Despite weaknesses, a great mix of drama, comedy, and morality play with an impressive transfer to DVD.  Highly recommended!",1085270400,10,910,5.5144927536231885
137611,5,0792199405,"As this was my favorite TV show when I was growing up, I was absolutely thrilled to be able to get the entire first season on DVD ( I home the rest of the show comes out on DVD also).  If you are a western fan, this show is for you.  It is intelligent and fast paced and, in comparison to today's TV shows, not really violent.  The shows were thought provoking and very well done.  I highly recommend this show to any and all lovers of great TV.",1085184000,5,445,3.966292134831461
137612,5,0792199405,"As a kid, my favorite western was Gunsmoke.  I became aware of Have Gun Will Travel by listening to old time radio (HGWT was one of the few shows to begin on television, and then move over to radio as well).  I first got to see HGWT on TV a couple of years ago, and was greatly impressed.  I was born 10 years after Have Gun made it's debut, but I now consider it to be one of the five best shows ever made.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in high quality classic TV.",1084492800,9,481,3.9791666666666665
137613,5,0792199405,"Have Gun Will Travel is one of the most remarkable series from television's so-called ""Golden Age"".  It boasts actors who can act (Richard Boone stands out on anyone's list), writers who can write (including Sterling Silliphant and Gene Roddenberry), and both characters and stories that remain three-dimensional even almost 50 years later.  Very few of the characters are all good or all bad (except Paladin, of course).  Even the villains are human beings.  And the concept of a Renaissance man as professional gunfighter is inspired.  The fact that he remains an enigma through most of the series is a bonus.
Guest stars on this series read like a ""Who's Who"" of Hollywood in that era and later.  Mike Conners (""Mannix""), Angie Dickinson (""Police Woman""), June Lockhart (""Lassie"" and ""Lost in Space""), Jack Lord (""Hawaii Five-O""), Harold J. Stone (myriads of character parts in TV and the movies), and others far too numerous to mention show up.
But Have Gun Will Travel is also a history lesson.  It is a sincere picture of the time in which it takes place.  The show, while always entertaining, deals with some weighty issues.  Many episodes deal with sexual inequality and racial relations.  One episode deals explicitly with the despicable treatment of the Chinese laborers by the railroad owners.  And they all try to capture the feeling of the time -- after the Civil War, when people were trying to make lives for themselves in the West, often under difficult conditions.
As with most DVD collections, the episodes are UNCUT.  They play very differently when they are allowed those extra few minutes to round out characters and plot.
One more note.  Season One consists of 39 episodes, as many series did at that time -- a far cry from the 24 (if you're lucky) that you get today.  And the price is a bargain.
Get this one to see Golden Age television at its very finest.",1084406400,13,1881,4.8193146417445485
137614,5,0792199405,"Out of the dozens of Westerns that premiered on television in the mid 1950's, ""Have Gun, Will Travel,"" is still arguably the best.  Richard Boone brought a distinct style of elegance and intelligence to the role of ""Paladin.""  Paladin preferred to reason his way out of difficulty, but was prepared to use his imposing, custom-made revolver to settle a score; always drawing second, but forever being true to his target.  ""Have Gun, Will Travel,"" ran for six seasons on CBS (1957-63), and often finished third in the Nielsen Top Ten during it's run, behind ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Wagon Train.""  Boone was offered a seventh season by CBS but decided to leave the program and begin his own anthology series on NBC, ""The Richard Boone Show,"" which featured Robert Blake, Ford Rainey, and Harry Morgan, among others.
Video tapes of the program have long been offered by Columbia House, but, for the first time, DVD's are now available from CBS.  The complete first season is enclosed in an attractive six-pack jacket.  Video quality is the same as the VHS tapes; what is surprising is that the sound quality is only fair, at best.  Among the few features available on the DVD's is a biography of the primary guest star of each program.
Performers to be found on ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" during the first season, are future stars Charles Bronson, Angie Dickinson, Stuart Whitman, Dan Blocker, Warren Oates, Jack Lord, and Pernell Roberts.  More likely you'll see terrific character actors such as R.G. Armstrong, Leo Gordon, John Carradine, Roy Barcroft, Denver Pyle, Robert Wilke, Murray Hamilton, Harold J. Stone, Ed Binns, Henry Brandon, Whit Bissell, Strother Martin, John Dehner, Anthony Caruso, and Claude Akins.
Amazon has offered the complete first season for a reasonable price.  My advice?  Snap up the DVD's and enjoy a literate, well-done Western.",1084406400,11,1846,5.022950819672131

137616,5,0792199405,"The theme by Johnny Western is almost as famous as the many trademarks of this classic western:  the white chess piece (a paladin), the calling card, the suave manner of the single named gunfighter dressed in black (death).  Richard Boone played this larger than life character to unheard of perfection beginning in 1958 and concluding with a five year run on CBS.  As with other series that played in the Golden Age of Television, present are future superstars:  Charles Bronson (in several episodes over the years), Jack Lord, Angie Dickinson...many others.

137618,5,0792199405,"I obviously haven't seen this DVD release yet but I did watch a number of the Columbia House DVD releases and the series is in excellent form. The B&W picture is fine and clear,the sound is very good.
The stories themselves are excellent Half-hour adventures with no wasted character or lines. Tight, compact plots with liberal doses of humour when needed and quick action that is usually not overdone and ""realistic"" for TV of that time.
Richard Boone makes the whole thing happen. A really great actor who, though we never learn all that much about Paladin, gives a great depth to the character that makes you care about him. Paladin is an honorable man but one who also likes the ladies and is an astute businessman but when the odds are against someone he feels he should give that person a chance to stand up for themselves. He doesn't do everything for them but does set things up so that they can stand up for themselves.

Along with John Russell in LAWMAN, Steve McQueen in WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE and Robert Culp in TRACKDOWN, Richard Boone stands tall as the iconic gunslinger and western troubleshooter.

137635,5,0792199405,I loved this show and remember it fondly.  I streamed a lot of the shows when streaming began at NETFLIX.  They had a lot of the old TV shows.  I also liked the beginning where it stated Wire Paladin and it gave the background of the stars for each episode.  I also liked to learn about how Gene Roddenberry wrote something like 23-26 episodes for Have Gun Will Travel series.  They always quipped or quoted him saying that the Star Trek series was like a wagon train to the stars.  He wrote many stories for television back in those early days. I was always surprised at how well the TV show Have Gun Will Travel did with a half hour series.  The DVD sets are good quality with no flaws.,1476144000,,688,4.246153846153846

137647,4,0792199405,"I happily purchased all six seasons of the ""Have Gun - Will Travel"" series after they stopped showing them on the Encore Westerns channel.  I very much liked the show as it was and is not your typical western series made at the end of the 50s and into the 60s. These CBS Televisions DVDs are not of the best viewing or audio quality when compared to, say, Season Four, but the story lines are quite good.  The first half of the total episodes have two interesting additions.  One is the ""Wire Paladin"" feature that discusses the cast members and, occasionally, the writers and directors in the episode as well as other work they have done.  The second, which disappears after the first half of the season episodes is an interesting synopsis of the episode.  The ""Wire Paladin"" synopsis continues through the first three seasons then abruptly and sadly disappears in season four.  You will also find in all of the seasons that the prologue audio extract from a portion of the episode's voice of Paladin made at the beginning at gunpoint is missing in a number of the episodes.  He simply draws his six shooter while the music plays and, other than the weapon pointing at you, nothing occurs.  I suspect that CBS Television lost that sound track portion on some of the episodes.  Interesting enough you will find that it is not until Season Four that an extra line to the Paladin theme song is added for the first time.  The extra line: ""...Paladin, Paladin far far from home"" is added at the end to the Johnny Western sung theme song.  Still for hardcore Paladin fans...enjoy the show!",1457395200,3,1584,4.621428571428571

137663,4,0792199405,"Richard Boone was Paladin. In San Francisco the well-dressed man who lived in the hotel attended the opera played winning cards and had an eye for the ladies one would find in a high-class San Francisco hotel (the Carlton). Once on the job is the hired gun in black bringing to bear his West Point training and never missing with his custom-made six shooter. Paladin was the thinking man's gun for hire. He understood that the law operated differently on the frontier but he also understood that a man's integrity came higher than the price of his hire.

Staying with Richard Boone for a moment's background includes both Russian Jews and distant family kinship with both entertainer Pat Boone and an American frontiersman Daniel Boone. It first learned acting while attending Stanford University which he dropped out to serve as an aviation ordinance man and gunner aboard torpedo bombers in the U.S. Navy. After the war he would use his G.I. Bill to study acting and indeed his acting career would extend over several decades including starring roles with John Wayne in the Alamo and later in the Shootist. He would be instrumental in having Hawaii 5-0 filmed in Hawaii where Boone himself lived but he turned down the lead role made famous by Jack Lord. For much of Boone's career he did mostly villains and mostly Westerns.

Among the many pleasures of the 39 episodes (39 episodes is one season?!) is trying to pick out which of the many stars will appear alongside of or facing down against Paladin's draw. Episode two or one depending on how you count the pilot gives us a young Charles Bronson as something of a noble outlaw. Later episodes give us at least two of the stars from the future Bonanza Parnell Roberts and very villainous saddle tramp Dan Blocher. June Lockhart will appear twice as Dr. Thackeray on the way to starring in Petticoat Junction and Lost in Space.

Having learned to watch the cast list for each show you'll begin to notice some other interesting names behind the camera. Sam Peckinpah has writing credits for one episode. And not even and especially bloody one. Gene Roddenberry across the life of the series has writing credits for 24 episodes there may be  three or four in this pack. In one of his episodes you'll see something that looks a lot like one of Uhura's more infamous dance routines from Star Trek; but will not be in a Gene Roddenberry episode where you'll hear the line about ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"". Assisting you in the process of spotting the stars are the extras that come with each episode. Early discs will give you both and episode summary and some background on the costars. Later discs will drop the episode summary. Often the future star will have a minor role in one of these episodes and may not be mentioned in the discussion of costars.

Although we will never learn Paladin's full name we do get some enticing glimpses into who he had to have been prior to becoming an ethical gun for hire. We know he is a former West Pointer. Given the general time frame of these episodes he had to of served in the Civil War. The fact that he knows some Chinese leads one to suspect he may have done a tour in Asia. He is extremely well read cultured philosophical and practical. Oddly his approach to women seems to be purely 1950s. If so moved he will force his attentions on female characters even if this is only limited to a kiss and even if he's willing to apologize for being overly aggressive. The one aspect of this character that cannot be consistent with more modern sensibilities is his attitude towards women. Dr. Thackeray is clearly the only serious romance he has in season one but he never seems to lose his eye for the overly dressed demimonde who walk about so confidently in his hotel.

I don't remember Paladin appearing quite so old and quite so worn as he does on the modern high definition screen. Which is something of a left-handed way of saying that picture quality is excellent. Nor did I have any problem hearing dialogue. Paladin comes across as the thinking man's Western and not so much the classic 50 shoot'em up as an almost pre-modern thinking man's gunman. Have Gun Will Travel is not just a classic of TV's Golden Age, it is classic TV.",1430784000,5,4256,4.608179419525066

Paladin's character--a magical blend of likeability, affability, integrity, virtue, chivalry, sexual satyrdom, good-humored charm, righteous indignation, down-to-earth naturalism, and a powerfully unstoppable sense of justice and fair play--is one of the most compelling portraits ever to grace the screen, TV or silver.  If you've never thought of the term ""star quality,"" check out Boone.  His performance, the show's writing (23 episodes of which were written by legendary Trek creator Gene Roddenberry--it's where he cut his teeth and got the idea for his ""Wagon Train to the stars""), and this uncanny flavor for a 50's Western series all make for an alchemical potion that will have anyone with a heart and mind under its spell and a MUST for any DVD library.",1408147200,8,1069,5.186046511627907

Children of the 60's will recognize many of the actors of the time as guest stars. Like Star Trek, this is something that I can watch again and again and never get tired of.

The show can be off-beat with some great, expressionist cinematography.  Worth watching despite the cringingly stereotyped ""Hey Boy.""  But the action sequences are among the worst I've seen.  Stumbling, unconvincing fist fights, and silly gun duels that make The Lone Ranger and The Rifleman look like balletic works of art.  Since Victor McLaglen's son has directorial credit and some reputation, I wonder if he was responsible.  I've watched only the first 10 episodes in this nostalgia fest, but I hope whoever does the choreography for the show improved as time went on!  P.S.

Many times gun play was needed but Paladin only used his when

One curious thing I've noticed throughout the series is that when he has to draw his gun his draw doesn't really seem that fast, especially when compared to other countless showdowns I've seen on TV and in films.

at night for youngsters..And, I have not really thought about the show until the reruns recently appeared on the Western Encore Channel.
My 12 year old Grandson watched a few episodes of Have Gun Will Travel and he loved the show! I watched with him and I was impressed.  I bought
the set, and it has been watched over and over without being bored, by all of us!  The set has a special place near the DVD player, along with
Wagon Train, Cheyenne, and Rawhide!  The Dvd is well worth the money, and I can heartily recommend Have Gun Will Travel for good family viewing.
Lots of learning for the young ones, too, with good historical facts thrown in and interesting information about Shakespeare.
I would give this set a 6, but it does not go up that high...All I can say is ""don't hesitate to buy""  Will help keep the kids and adults up on morals and entertained at the same time!  I am used to black and white, and the quality of the DVD's are excellent.

137755,5,0792199405,"This series is from an era when westerns dominated televison programming, i.e., the 1950's and a bit beyond.  Each had its own gimmick, and the one here is that a fast gun for hire is a knight errant ""without armor in a savage land.""

The episodes often began in a posh San Francisco hotel with ""Paladin"" dressed suavely, reading a newspaper, giving instructions to a Chinese lad, ""Hey Boy,"" and smoking a cheroot.  Soon the knight would be off on another adventure, saving a lass, or whatever.  He was strictly a man of honor who only shot those who deserved to be shot.

It isn't perfect.  The opening, with Paladin drawing his six gun, is a bit wearing.  For one thing his leather holster and its stitching is shiny new, not the equipment of a veteran gunslinger.  Then one must accept the fact that Paladin has calling cards and hands one to a client in every episode.  That also gets a little old.  As for realizm, well, the people and towns are too clean (smooth sand streets, no horse manure anywhere), the hats are wrong (too clean, too neatly creased,) etc.  In that respect, this is standard western fare.

The black and white photography is great.  Richard Boone was no pretty boy.  He looks rough and is.  The dialogue is fine, and most of the acting is good as well.

It's all Richard Boone.  The show is not especially well written, although the music is pretty good and premise is great--a rich, San Francisco dandy/black dressed lethal gunfighter who quotes literature and always does the right thing. But Boone is what makes it work.  Even in these relatively primitive productions in the late 50s, he just shines as an actor, far and away the best and most appealing in that genre.

137766,5,0792199405,"I'm not a genius, but I know one when I see one. When you look back and see how smart the guys were who created and wrote the Have Gun Will Travel TV shows, then you appreciate the shows even more. I went through my entire life not knowing what Paladin meant. Not long ago I actually looked it up in the dictionary, and here is what I found:

""paladin."" Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. 09 Mar. 2008. <Dictionary.com [...]>.

1. any one of the 12 legendary peers or knightly champions in attendance  on Charlemagne.
2. any knightly or heroic champion.
3. any determined advocate or defender of a noble cause.

The perfect description of Paladin. Now you know the symbolism of the knight on his holster and business card.....and his name! If that is not genius, then I don't know what is. Sadly, it took me almost 50 years to realize this, but you will appreciate the shows even more with this bit of knowledge... at least I did.

These shows are timeless. You know that good will triumph over evil  every time, and you know Paladin will not hesitate to kill the bad guys who are taking advantage of the poor innocents. They are going to get theirs, and it's a comfort knowing that he will do it every time. I remember one lady who thanked Paladin after he had just killed her husband. She said if not Paladin, someone else would have done it, and she was relieved. Charles Bronson is the guy Paladin shot. Many of the players on this series went on to become big stars. Johnny Western sings the song at the end of many shows. He appears on the show sometimes, and I remember listening to him as as DJ on the radio station KFDI in Wichita, Kansas, back in the 1980s.

Anyone who watches this show secretly wishes they could be like Paladin, especially the guys. He is suave and debonair with the ladies, he speaks countless languages, graduated from West Point, and has a fast and accurate draw that no one can match. The definition of 'hero' should include the word 'Paladin' as part of its meaning.

One of the other reviewers has listed all the episodes, so I won't try to duplicate it here. If you buy this, you won't be disappointed. Besides, your time will be better spent watching these shows than almost any of the stuff on TV nowadays.",1205020800,3,2264,4.464891041162228

Having not seen an episode of Have Gun Will Travel for more than 40 years, it was great to see that the opening sequence (or prelude) is included in each episode. I have watched only 3 of the episodes to date and was slightly disappointed that the theme song at the end only appeared in the first of the episodes.

The video quality is excellent but I can only rate the sound quality as OK.

137772,5,0792199405,"Let me tell you a little something. I'm a thirtysomething woman from New England, a reader and traveler who works full time in a technical field. The western genre was never a big part of my life as a child; to this day the theme song for Bonanza gives me a case of the shudders. And yet somehow this series, an overly dramatic black and white western with terrible audio quality, is a real delight to me.

Originally, I bought it because I was curious about the closing credits song: Stephen King's ""Stand By Me"" left an indellible impression on my mind, and the song the boys sang made me deeply curious about the series that inspired it. I put it on my wish list and contemplated it for a while; in a slow season for new releases I bought it. It sat on my shelf waiting for a long night when I was tired of reading and willing to give it a chance; a patient show, because it took a long time for me to come around. But once I started watching I couldn't stop. I've been sneaking an episode or six in every chance I could get, when I was supposed to be sleeping or eating or cleaning - Plunk in front of the TV, pop in the disk and gobble up a couple more episodes.

I have to admit that there were personal moments of ""A Ha!' for me. I watched a lot of Star Trek as a kid, and realized partway into this series that Gene Rodenburry was a director; I then spotted moments and characters that struck a familiar chord. The Aramenian dancing woman is deeply reminiscent of the Orion women form the original Trek; or perhaps the other way around. The character Ella West should sing deja vu to anyone who watched Natasha Yarr in the Next Generation.

There are other cliches: the dive for the gun, the terrible fight scenes, the balsawood studio sets. It's fun for me to see where the cliches come from, as I missed them the first time around. The effects, by today's standards, are abysmial. But the characterization and intelligent writing are wonderful.

All in all I love this show. The depictions of violence are so tame by today's standards, and the hero insists on attempting to use brains and nonviolent means in every situation before resorting to a gun, so I'd feel completely comfortable loaning it to my friends with young kids. But the hero is a professional gunslinger who chases women, drinks, smokes and gambles; he's a rogue and a poet, so it's not boring for adults either.",1181692800,4,2389,4.398190045248869
137773,5,0792199405,"I got this for my father's birthday. He loved it, and asked me to watch with him. Now I understand why.

The lead character, Paladin, is the type of character that's almost perfect in every way. He went to Harvard, traveled the world, speaks a dozen languages, knows the finer workings on a great number of subjects, and basically knows something about everything. A Gary Stu, if you know what that term means.

He manages to rise above all of that by the grace of a singe aspect: his passion on doing right. His moral compass points straight at good and never seems to waver. Regardless of who hires him, only good will come of his work. He refuses jobs that run counter to his morals. And while he is a gun for hire, he only ever uses the gun as an absolute last resort.

I'm quite impressed with the character on the whole and would very strongly recommend this to anyone. Especially those with a love for the wild west.",1180483200,3,923,4.385964912280702

This is not just a shoot-em-up western.  Many issues of that day and this one are explored in the episodes.  Topics of racism or women rights get some really toughtful treatments.

I won't go into the premise of the show, others have done a great job on that, so there is no need to repeat it. The main question you will want to know is ""Will I like it?"" The writing is superior, and I am very surprised at the diversity of topics that they cover, from womens rights, to keeping pets that are outside the norm, to comitting a parent to an asylum. Each espisode is very different from the next. This is not your typical western, it is a thinking man's western. It is not a John Wayne type movie either...not that there's anything wrong with that. I showed my 11 year old daughter the show, and she became an instant fan. My wife, who hates westerns, loved it after one episode. My wife, like Paladin, has no tolerance for stupid people, stereotypes and ignorance in general. I can honestly say, that I think anyone would like this show, regardless of age. You can always get a few one liners out of every show. IMHO, they just don't write TV this good anymore. You could fit Paladin's character into any Quentin Tarantino movie, and the fit would be perfect. Not for the violence, but for the smart writing. I have already ordered seasons 2 and 3.

This series reminds me of BRANDED with Chuck Connors. I also bought [and viewed] both seasons of BRANDED, also available on Amazon. There's a zen factor in Paladin and BRANDED, also in some other early black and white western themed series like Rifleman, also starring Connors, but I digress..... I love this stuff. It builds character and it's an exercise of the soul. I'm getting through the 2nd season right now each night around sleepy-time. I'll order season #3 soon, then #4, etc, etc....

137787,5,0792199405,"A landmark in television, this box set offers every episode from the first season, including ""Hey Boy's Revenge,"" with a pre-Bonanza Purnell Roberts as a the villain, which TV GUIDE hailed as one of the 100 best episodes of any TV show - ever.

Also included is ""The Great Mojave Chase"" involving a camel (written by Gene Roddenberry, the first of 24 scripts written by him for the series), ""The Outlaw"" with Charles Bronson (considered one of the top ten episodes of the series), and the classic Christmas episode ""The Hanging Cross.""  The series only hd two Christmas episodes, this was one of them (the other was during the program's sixth and final season).

Watch out for John Dehner as the villain in ""HIgh Wire.""  Dehner was Paladin on the radio series and as a result, this marked his only appearance on the series.  June Lockhart appears as Dr. Phyllis Thackeray in two episodes during the first season, and sadly, she never returned to the series again (cause she began working for LASSIE).  ""Helen of Abajinian"" offers a tongue-in-cheek verbal exchange between Samuel Abajinian and Paladin worth the price of admission.

Andrew McLaglen directed numerous episodes of this television series and his father, Victor McLaglen, appears as Mike O'Hare in ""The O'Hare Story.""  Since Richard Boone had once been a professional boxer, they incorporated his skills in ""The Prize-Fight Story,"" in which Paladin must battle for half of the profits.

My only gripe is the trivia and notes that are supposed to accompany each episode.  They are worthless.  Telling me Gene Roddenberry created STAR TREK isn't exciting and most of the notes anyway just mention the supporting actors and what movies they did.  If you really want to know the background such as who broke an arm during filming, what stunt man made an error on the screen, and lots of goodies, I suggest you get THE HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Les Rayburn and Martin Grams also available on Amazon.com.  Until I got the book, I had no idea that the young kid Paladin wounds in the first-season episode entitled ""The Return of Dr. Thackeray"" was Johnny Western, who composed a ""thank you"" song for the producers for appearing on the show - which ultimately became the ""Ballad of Paladin"" as the closing theme for seasons two through six.

137789,5,0792199405,"First, I love half-hour dramas. They are a holdover from radio where executives thought that a half hour was as long as they could hold an audience. When TV began they took what they learned on radio and transferred it. (Interestingly, HGWT was the only TV show to spawn a radio show - usually it was the reverse.) The format trims the fat and makes for taut story-telling. So you've got a great format and another key ingredient - Richard Boone, a terrific actor. He was Paladin ""a soldier of fortune in a savage land"" named by TV Guide as one of the all time 100 top tv characters. A refined gentleman in San Francisco who dons a black cowboy outfit to work as a troubleshooter to afford his refined tastes. Oh, and let's not forget the writing. Many of the episodes were written by none other than Gene Roddenberry, honing his skill that would be evident in Star Trek. His scripts are always clever and thoughtful - a must for trek fans especially the episode where three lovely mail-order brides arrive under suspicious circumstances for some lonely ranchers (shades of Mudd's Women!)The bottom line is this series will spoil you for real entertainment.

I'd also forgotten what a great actor the ruggedly handsome (i.e. ugly) Richard Boone was. He was as comfortable and natural in front of a camera as my favorite actor, Charlton Heston. This is a truly great DVD collection.

The boxed set includes 39 episodes. Thirty-nine episodes!!! That was television back in those days. A season would be 39 episodes long with 13 weeks off. Now, it's exactly the opposite, because TV shows have become so expensive to produce. I remember when Battlestar Galactica was the most expensive series ever produced, at a million dollars an episode. Now, greedy television stars are demanding a million-dollar salary a week!

137791,5,0792199405,"Richard Boone may have been the first 'man in black' as he plays Paladin, the highly educated and affluent gentleman who resides in a luxry hotel in San Francisco where each day he scans the papers looking for conflicts that he will resolve by hiring out his gun. Boone's charcter is West Point trained in military affairs, is a veteran, ladys man, he knows the arts, Shakespear and he is somewhat of a psychologist and scientist as he seems to know a lot about everything while still maintaining a background of mystery. He makes his living by hiring out his gun to primarily settle disputes or ocassionally bring some one in. The twist is that he is highly ethical and he evaluates each situation individually and he may even change sides. A classic example in the first year collection is when he is hired by a prisoner under arrest to make sure he survives in a vigilante town until he makes trial. Paladin provides protection but stops the prisoner from making a jail break, his agreement is to protect him until he gets his trial, he does get to trial and he hangs. Paladin is known by his calling card: ""Have Gun Will Travel, Wire Paladin San Francisco"" with the symbol of a chess piece knight etched on the card. The same knight is on his holster. Paladin frequently resolves disputes with his head but he is known for being a fast drawing gunfighter who shoots with accuracy and he does frequently. The first year as well as the subsequent years feature current stars of the 50s and many budding stars of the future. The video quality is surprisingly good and much better than the grainy versions last seen on local TV. The best way to watch is on DVD particularly since each episode has a menu that includes a plot line and a list of prominent guest stars. Amazing that ""Have Gun"" was criticized in it's day for being too violent, which after watching, you will find it more intellectual, action packed but less violent than TV today. Running from 1957 to 63, this was truly a unique show, and often amusing particular when Paladin would quote Shakespear or a poet such as Shelly while in remote areas of the west often having to translate the meaning.

137794,5,0792199405,"This box set already has many excellent reviews, as it should.  Most points that I would have liked to make have already been made, and I'll keep this short.

I was born in '72.  When I was a youngster, my favorite Western TV shows were ""HGWT,"" ""The Rebel,"" and ""Branded.""  Compared to today's television, ""Branded"" and ""The Rebel"" are awfully good, but they do not hold a candle to ""Have Gun-Will Travel.""

Funny Story:  When I was very young, I thought Paladin's first name was ""Wire.""  I didn't understand that ""wire"" was slang for ""telegraph.""

As others have mentioned, the first season of ""HGWT"" is more ""Western"" that later seasons (particularly 2 and 6).  Over the years, I have seen most of the episodes, but never in the correct order.  Now that the DVDs allow me to do this, I have noticed that the first season really sets out to explode all of the Western genre stereotypes.  I think it is interesting that some of the best co-star performances of season 1 are delivered by the actresses: Marian Seldes, Angie Dickinson, and Marion Crane.

The content of the DVDs couldn't be better.  There are only two kinds of people in this world: 1) Richard Boone fans; 2) People who do not yet know that they are Richard Boone fans.

Now for the bad.  The DVDs themselves are nothing to brag about.  The external packaging and the individual case artwork are both beautiful and tasteful.  Unfortunately, after popping the disc into the player, the trouble begins.  On older players, the set defaults to Spanish subtitles ""ON"" mode.  On any player I have tried, skipping too many chapters too quickly also triggers the Spanish subtitles.  It is a royal pain to get the subtitles turned off on certain players.  Ironically, this doesn't happen on my $19.99 COBY DVD player...

The DVD menu layout and artwork don't measure up to the external package art, at all.  As others have mentioned, it is painfully obvious that the ""Wire Paladin"" segments were not written by a student of classic television or radio.

Second, though Paladin might quote Browning or Pliny to some local yokels who look at each other wondering who this consarned dude in black is talking about, the thing I like about his lifestyle is the way he consorts (and I use that word correctly) with some of the ladies of Old San Francisco at his suite in the Hotel Carlton. In one episode, he is escorting a lady down the stairs who is obviously still adjusting her clothing and whom he does NOT walk to the door: pretty daring stuff for 1957 TV! In the same episode, Paladin whispers something into the ear of a particularly attractive woman who appears to either be a (term again used advisedly..)mulatto or asian. Believe me, no other 1950's western ""hero"" EVER talked to a woman who wasn't white, and especially not whispering something which made her giggle. Then again, she's coming down the same staircase...perhaps a menage?

At the very same time, Paladin is a complete gentleman: he always doffs his hat in the presence of a lady, even if he is the only one to do so. And he never talks down to Hey Boy either, who is in a way his assistant (and associate).

Boone was likely the best actor in the complete era of the Cowboy TV Show. There were up-and-comers (Steve McQueen, Gene Barry, Hugh O'Brien, Wayde Preston) and guys who had already been there (Guy Madison, Roy Rogers, Jock Mahoney, Scott Brady). But on acting talent, Boone had 'em all covered every time.

The Paladin character is a one-of-a-kind: there has never been another like him, and praise be there hasn't been some hackneyed ""remake"" of Paladin starring some young Hollypunk either. Buy this upon my guarantee that you will like it. But be warned: Paladin sells no wolf tickets - when he threatens, he follows through. He likes talking lovingly about his weapons...and never denies he is a hired gun. Thus, he may be the only ""bad guy"" to ever star in a successful cowboy TV series.

137802,5,0792199405,"This series has really crossed over into true Americana. From the beginning it was kissed by the fates and had a very popular five year run, ending only when the Western genre itself had worn out its welcome with television audiences in the mid sixties.

What made it so immediately popular, and why is its appeal so timeless?

Well, for starters it was based on a genius premise: A sophisticated, cultured mystery man has based himself in the well-appointed Hotel Carlton in San Francisco just after the Civil War.  He spends his days smoking fine cigars and reading several out-of-town newspapers in the hotel lobby, and his nights are spent in high-stake poker games (always between gentlemen) or escorting San Francisco's most beautiful women to the San Francisco Opera House (in fact his romantic involvements have forced him on more than one occasion to accept out of town work rather hastily). He can quote Shakespeare or Milton easily and with obvious pleasure, or explain a complex piece of history to demonstrate the sad glory and weakness resident in all men. He is patient and tolerant with all, close to none. He is also more than a little mysterious. It is said he is a war hero and a graduate of West Point, but no one seems to know for sure. He is only known by the name Paladin, and no one ever, during all the years the series ran, called him anything else (Paladin, by the way, is defined in Webster's Ninth as: ""1: a champion of a medieval prince 2: an outstanding protagonist of a cause"").

Occasionally he will come upon a disturbing bit of news in his newspaper readings. He immediately calls for his Chinese manservant (who is in fact employed by the Carlton but seems nearly always at his beck and call) to post a letter for him immediately, offering his services. The letter will contain only one thing - a business card with a chess piece in the center, the knight, and the words ""Have Gun - Will Travel. Wire Paladin - San Francisco."" If the party in question can afford his high price, they can hire his gun to solve their problems.

Second in the list of reasons explaining the shows success: it was packed with heavyweights. Gene Roddenbery and Sam Peckenpah were regular writers. Andrew V. McLaglen directed the first season and Bernard Herman wrote the score (in every episode the famous business card is flashed once, always filling the screen, accompanied by a dramatic snatch of Herman score. Every fan of the series could feel the moment coming in their gut).  Charles Bronson, Strother Martin, Harry Carry Jr., Warren Oates, and many other future and legendary stars were either cutting their teeth or making honorary appearances throughout the series. Really, they don't call it the Golden Age of Television for nothing.

And finally, the most significant reason for the series' success: Richard Boone. If ever an actor filled a role more perfectly, I haven't seen it. The actor's large boned, creviced face defines the series. He filled the role with the dignity and authority of deposed royalty, whether he was ordering vintage wine in the cosmopolitan Hotel Carlton or dressed in black, walking into an unfriendly frontier saloon. Boone could draw and level his Colt Single Action Army .45 and quote Euripides in a smooth baritone, making the moment look as natural as Sunday morning. He could handle anything, and he was an easy man to believe in completely. What more needs to be said? Few television heroes wore their crowns with such ease.

My favorite moment from season one? Episode 33 ""The Silver Queen."" Paladin has knocked a man to the ground. The man draws his gun, only to find himself staring up into the barrel of Paladin's Colt. A grin develops on Paladins' face, which turns into a warm, nearly friendly chuckle. ""Oh my,"" says Paladin, faced yet again with man's eternal folly, ""you are slow."" It is a supreme moment of ease and grace, tinged with pity and affection.

This series is a treasure. -Mykal Banta",1123459200,4,3965,4.7682215743440235

137804,5,0792199405,"If you love old westerns, especially TV westerns, you've got to have this six set DVD.  There are over 40 episodes on the six discs.  ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" was one of my all time favorite TV series from the 50's, 60's.  I was thirteen when Richard Boone became Paladin.  I think I even had a toy six-gun and holster with a derringer.  HGWT used some of the old western stereotypes, but had many story lines that were unique, more drama than the typical shoot'em up western.  What was so enjoyable was that so many of Hollywood's character actors appeared in the different casts.  What was surprising was the many actors, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, Charles Bronson to name a few that went into their own shows or the movies.  Gene Rodenberry (Star Trek) wrote many of the scripts.  It was a great trip back in time and into the history of television.  A great bonus was each episode has a Wire Paladin option that gives information about Paladin or the actors in the cast.",1122163200,4,976,4.525714285714286
137805,4,0792199405,"If the audio quality of Have Gun Will Travel were as good as the quality of the programs themselves, I would've given this set 5 stars.

Unfortunately, the audio is surprisingly poor. The volume of the programs is much softer than the volume of the Main Menu screen. The sound also isn't as clear as it should be for today's technology. Cranking the volume when the show starts, and emersing yourself in the stories themselves takes care of the problem, but it's still annoying.

The extra features of the DVD's are minimal. With each episode, you can choose a Wire Paladin option, which will give you a little background about some of the actors on the show, some of the plots, info on the writers, etc. Usually it's not much more than half a page worth of brief info. On most episodes, you'll also have a Guest Cast option (I believe this option isn't available in Disk 4 of the set) which gives a brief history on one or a few of the actors in the chosen episode. Some of it's elementary, and some of it is interesting. Still, nothing more than this text. No interviews, no ""making of""...nothing about the overall history of the show itself. A funny thing about these two extras: In the episode in which John Dehner stars, a biography was given about Dehner, but no mention was made of Dehner being cast as Paladin in the radio version of Have Gun Will Travel (and did an excellent job at it, too). I figured, 'maybe they left out Dehner's credit of the radio series because most knew about it'. If that was the case, then Denver Pyle wouldn't have been mentioned in separate episodes as playing Uncle Jesse in the Dukes of Hazzard.

The lack of quality extras isn't much of a big deal considering I wanted the collection for the episodes themselves. IMO, this really is the best western TV series ever aired. But the audio quality is really a disappointment. Still, you have to have this collection, and you shouldn't wait around for Encore Westerns to show it.

2) I note that Paladin respected diversity, whispering something in the ear of a lovely woman walking by in the hotel lobby, and she chuckled somewhat erotically.  I note she looked to be a medium brown in color, at least in black-and-white!

3) Paladin respected diversity by understanding different cultures and also showed respect by learning some rudiments of their language.  He spoke fluent Spanish, some Cantonese, enough Arabic to ride a camel, etc.

4) He appreciated honesty and was against political correctness.  He was against teaching a partisan viewpoint.  He wanted the truth about Quantrell's Raiders and about the Jayhawkers both taught by the schoolteacher.

5) He was heartily pro-Second Amendment, as you might note from his statement that a town's rules requiring turning in one's weapons merely made it certain that the town would be taken over by the lawless, the precise group which would not obey that law.  The law-abiding would be left defenseless.

6) The whisper in the ear followed by the throaty chuckle was much sexier than Janet Jackson's costume reveal.

7) Paladin was strong enough to be gentle and polite.  He stopped beside the young Lana Wood, playing a shopkeeper's daughter, and complimented her on her skill in darning a sock.

8) The fight scenes and actual gunplay are pretty ridiculous.  People are shot but no holes appear in them or their clothing for the most part.  Paladin ains for the arm or hand in a life-or-death situation.  Those shot in the arm often just walk off with ""a bullet in their arm,"" when in fact such a slug would have passed through, shattering bones and veins and arteries and they would be bleeding all over the place.  During a gunfight, people would often stand around beside or behind the gunfighters, risking a bullet.

9) Richard Boone had one of the most genuine laughs of amusement and self-amusement ever on the stage, screen, or radio.

10) After the Paladin show was over, he started a TV show which was a ""repertory company"" format, featuring the same actors each week but playing different characters in completely different stories.

11) Richard Boone had the most baleful, threatening stare of anyone in history.  Just a look could cause a mad-dog gunfighter to back down or a thoughtless jerk to reconsider his statement and apologize.

In Summary:  He was a fine role model for a youngster growing up in the late 50s and early 60s.  I contrast this with the current generation of TV shows which are much more graphic and with much better special effects.",1110758400,7,2606,4.870454545454545
137810,5,0792199405,"Richard Boone stars as Paladin in this six-disk dvd set of the first season of HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL (1957-1958).

  CBS broadcast an incredible thirty-nine episodes that first season, each episode lasting 23 to 25 minutes.  Most episodes begin with the spiffily dressed Paladin (we're never given a last name) scouring the thick stacks newspapers brought to him by the ever helpful Hey Boy (Kam Tong), bellboy at Paladin's residence, the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco.  Eventually Paladin reads of a missing child in Colorado, or a rash of robberies occurring in Montana. Paladin slips his business card - a chess knight with the legend Have Gun, Will Travel, Wire Paladin, San Francisco - into an envelope and mails it to the injured party.

  Slowly enough as we wend our way through the first year we learn something of Paladin.  He has a passion for justice and a taste for the good things.  His going rate is $1000, although he will take on a pro bono job if the cause is just.  In town he dresses to the nines and in sundry other ways consumes conspicuously.  When traveling with a gun he dresses in black.  Somewhere along the line he picked up a military education, quotes Shakespeare and Pliny, savors a first-edition of Dryden.  His taste in and knowledge of fine wines is commented upon in a couple of episodes....

  I don't know if any of this matters, but going through fifteen hours of HGWT over a week or so it's kind of fun to have an aha moment or two.  Paladin is an enigma, and Boone, a little more credible as the gunslinger than the city dandy, was an inspired choice to play him.  Boone has a commanding presence and, believe me when I tell you buckaroos, was pretty darn quick on the draw.

  Twenty-three minutes is a pretty tight box to fit a action story in, which might explain why we don't waste a whole lot of time on Paladin's backstory.  Of course, the storytelling is made a lot easier when you consider the talent involved.  The talent rundown has to start with Boone, who was nominated Best Leading Actor as Paladin in 1959 and 1960.  The great majority of the first season episodes were directed by action veteran Andrew McLaglen (son of actor Victor McLaglen), although a couple were helmed by Oscar winning director Lewis Milestone.  Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wrote a few scripts for the first season as well.  Sam Peckingpah even co-wrote one episode (The Singer).

  The talent in front of the camera was as formidable as that behind.  Major established stars like Victor McLaglen and John Carradine appeared in episodes - weak ones, in my opinion, especially the McLaglen episode (directed by son Andrew) in which the old actor played a construction foreman threatening to cut a town off from its source of water.  McLaglen simply wasn't getting around very briskly and it's a little painful to watch.  Another major movie star fares much better.  Charles Bronson wasn't established yet, but he plays a robber who more or less forces Paladin into a gunfighting showdown in an episode that paints fatal violence as both regrettable and, sometimes, unavoidable.  Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke) appears in two episodes, once as an unscrupulous frontier lawyer and earlier in a more affecting role as a high wire walker who'd lost his nerve somewhere along the way.  Warren Oates plays one of the bad offspring in a truncated take on King Lear.

  That's just the beginning.  Future television stars appear in almost every episode. Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker (Bonanza) appear as scruffy tough guys in relatively small roles in separate episodes.  Jack Lord (Hawaii 5-0) is a cowardly kidnapper.  June Lockhart (Lassie, Lost In Space) appears twice as a frontier doctor.  Angie Dickinson (Police Woman) plays a young woman whose brother was murdered and threatens to incite a lynch mob.  Mike Connors (Mannix) plays a cattle rustling bad guy in one of the early episodes.

  Okay, I'm enthusing here. Still haven't got to the best stuff.  What gave me the biggest kick was watching the people I'd never heard of.  Peter Whitney, who the intro blurb that precedes each episode tells us made a film career out of playing slow-witted big guys and menacing big guys, plays a mentally challenged ranch hand who's goaded into placing a burr under boss's Stuart Whitman's saddle, with dire consequences, in ""The Last Laugh.""  The diminutive B-western star Bob Steele plays a crooked mine boss in ""The High Graders"" - the Wire Paladin blurb tells us Steele had developed a quick draw during his B-career, which McLaglen pays homage to in a draw down between his character and Paladin.  My favorite discovery, though, has to be Marian Seldes, a tremendous actress who is featured in two episodes.  First as a mail order bride who Paladin escorts to her new home in ""The Bride"" and later as a small town teacher who the local bullies try to intimidate in ""The Teacher.""

  Very strongly recommended, especially for fans of traditional westerns.",1110672000,168,4988,4.811542991755006
137811,4,0792199405,"Have Gun Will Travel, the hit series airing from 1957 to 1963, was  the creation of two innovative ex-radio writers, who had been tipped that CBS was in the market for a cowboy show with a ""different twist."" The result was a truly adult TV western, which chronicled the exploits of a West Point educated solider of fortune known simply as Paladin. Historically the term ""paladin"" is associated with the medieval knights of Charlemagne's court, who were often called upon to travel the country and resolve issues between the king's subjects. Indeed, the TV paladin is a complex combination of knight errant and resourceful gunslinger, who upon payment of $1,000 will leave his well-appointed suite in San Francisco's Hotel Carlton to pursue whatever mission a well-heeled client commissions. A gourmet, an opera buff, and a connoisseur of fine wine, women, and Ming Dynasty artifacts, Paladin can quote Keats, Shelley, and Shakespeare with the same self-assurance that he brings to defeating frontier villains.

The character of Paladin is played with sharp intelligence and dry wit by talented actor Richard Boone. Boone's intimidating growl, prominent nose, and pock-marked visage physically distinguished him from the typical pretty-boy hero, just as his character's cultured background distinguished him from more rustic inhabitants of the1870s Old West. Dressed all in black and sporting a waxed mustache, his holster embossed with a silver chess knight, Paladin routinely hands out his signature calling card--an image of a white knight chess piece with the inscription ""Have Gun, Will Travel . . . Wire Paladin, San Francisco."" The charisma and sophistication of his character brought Boone more loyal female fan mail than many of his more photogenic cowboy contemporaries received.

The thirty-minute episodes spanning five seasons of Have Gun Will Travel were immensely popular, and the individualistic take on the traditional western format made an international star of its talented lead actor. All in all, it was a well-written show, moral without being preachy. Paladin often solved problems with his wits and powers of negotiation rather than his gun. He was respectful toward women and ethnic groups and spoke any language the plots called for. Yes, the show is dated in it's view of the proper place of women, and not every episode is top-notch, but in general the writing is good, particularly within the confines of a half-hour drama format. You will encounter a number of guest actors, such as Jack Lord (Hawaii 5-O), Charles Bronson, DeForest Kelley (Star Trek), and  June Lockhart, who would later become prominent television stars.

137813,5,0792199405,"This will be a review by someone who purchased ALL the Columbia House VHS videotapes of ""Have Gun Will Travel"" (as well as ALL the available ""Maverick"" and the half hour ""Gunsmoke"" VHS tapes) as soon as they were available, from 1995 to 1998. The price for four episodes of the half hour series was about $25 (about $5 for shipping.) If you do the math, these DVDs are a fantastic savings AND offer the added bonus of being easier to store and probably to use.

The quality of the VHS tapes was crystalline, which is probably why the DVDs have been reviewed favorably in the technical sense. Much of the filming for ""HGWT"" was done on location in what seems to be pristine wilderness areas, and this clarity of viewing - the extra effort to get the locations done by the production staff and the effort required by the actors involved - is beautiful to watch as well. Most episodes start out in the SF hotel and then lead Paladin far afield on his missions.+

It is true that the Gene Roddenberry episodes are very special. Even in the 90s, when a script - and the way that the actors presented it - awed me, it was almost certainly a Roddenberry episode. Truly, eye opening. You understand why ""Star Trek"" has been around forever.

Like many children of the 50s, Westerns were the 'meat and potatoes' of my TV experience, and while I liked the shows like ""Maverick"" and ""HGWT"" at that age, but to be able to view them as an adult is amazing. I would also recommend the same for the half hour ""Gunsmoke"" episodes. Clearly, these series went far beyond the standard shoot 'em ups and good guys versus bad guys plotting of production line Westerns. There were a lot of adult level references within the programming and it makes re-viewing later in life even more entertaining, and, leaves a powerful positive impression of all involved.

I would suggest also that the first few years of the ""HGWT"" series are the best. In the 50s, there were a lot of episodes being filmed every season, so at least the first three seasons are mainly outstanding.

Cannot say enough about the acting skills of Richard Boone: FANTASTIC! He brought that character to life as a multi-dimensional human being.

Watching it again now as an adult, I would say it is a great show.  The stories are interesting, the episodes are well produced, and Richard Boone is absolutley magnificent.  As for the quality of the DVD set, the picture is excellent, although the dialogue is a little muffled in places, which could be my aging ears.  The extras aren't great, but that's ok with me.  There is some background info on each episode.  When people talk of how good TV was in the old days, this is one of the shows that made TV great in the old days.

  I was born the year before ""Have Gun Will Travel"" aired for the first time, so I never had a chance to see the show when it was brand new.  I actually got to see it for the first time around 1973 when it aired in reruns on WOR-TV channel 9 in New York.  I saw one episode and I was an instant fan.  I was crazy about Paladin which was strange for me since I didn't care that must for westerns.  It was such a great show.  Paladin, the cultured gentleman who lived at the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco - who became the gunslinger in black when the need arose which was with every job he got wired to do.  He had morals which was something your average gunslinger did not have.

I thought Richard Boone was the greatest !  Anyway, I would tell any fan of this great show to buy this 1st season release and all the seasons after that !  They will not be sorry ! I am thrilled to be able to own this DVD.  - Reviewer - Linda Ross",1092009600,7,944,3.931216931216931

They fit a lot of  story in less than 30 minutes. I have always been a fan of television westerns, and they are rarely shown in my part of Canada. Even our western channel does not show the really good western shows. My favourate was gunsmoke,it hasn't been shown for years. I hope the have gun will travel series sells well and they release more seasons, and this leads to other TV westerns being released. With gunsmoke and its 20 seasons it could be an expensive collection. I am hoping to see box sets of the best of gunsmoke ,the colour episodes are my favourites.

You do not have to disagree with the reviewers assessment of a film to determine whether the review was helpful or not.

 I saw the Have Gun Will Travel episodes on tv many moons ago so I would have to say that at least 90% of the reviews here are unhelpful to me in deciding whether or not I want to purchase the referenced DVDs. I already know the series was great, so what's new here? For viewers who never saw the series, maybe it's the other way around and 90% of those would think the reviews are helpful to them.

 As for me, along with the glowing praises, I'd like to know about DVD picture and sound quality along with any special features or interviews with actors or writers included. Is the original music score included? Those are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

 Writers who would address those (and other) issues would likely get a ""helpful"" vote from me. As for the others...?",1091145600,8,1136,4.4375

 Almost from the very beginning the man in black, who always gave out his famous calling card ""Have Gun--Will Travel"" wire Paladin, San Francisco, an invitation you just couldn't refuse when you were in trouble or on the edge of a catastrophe ~ opening theme was composed by Bernard Herrmann, who in my humble opinion gave the series much credibility with the haunting music that meant Paladin was ready for action or had just handed someone his famous card.

 Some of the best in the business was in the stable of this CBS winner ~ Andrew V. McLaglen (director), Gene Roddenbury (writer), Sam Peckinpah (writer), starring some well known faces with Claude Akins, R.G. Armstrong, John Carradine, Mike Connors, Angie Dickinson, June Lockhart, Jack Lord, Strother Martin, Victor McLaglen, Warren Oates ~ with digital clarity and sound to boot, this has the makings of a winner.

 Hats off to CBS and Paramount Pictures for sharing this entire first season that ran five seasons ~ this is when good drama with a Western flavor rode the trails and things were good ~ Richard Boone took this role very seriously and it showed ~ if you're into good stories, fine actors and plenty of action, this one is for you ~ so wire Paladin and have his gun travel with you for your next purchase of an outstanding collection...gotta love it!

137824,5,0792199405,"Richard Boone was one of the most natural actors ever to grace the screen.  Good guys, bad guys, he did them all with such a grace and ease that he made it seem so effortless.  Paladin was a product of the post-Civil War.  A West Point Graduate, he was an educated man, a man who appreciated literature, opera, culture.  So it was not surprising he settled in San Franscisco after the war.  Though a man of refinement, he made his living by hiring his gun out to those in need.  He passed his little cards around - ""Have Gun, Will Travel.  Wire Paladin, San Fransisco"" and waited for clients to find him.
While a cultured man, he was just as comfortable in the deadly knight errant persona, the man in black.  Boone excelled at making you believe both sides could exist within one man.  While he was a hired gun, he often spent more time talking to people making them listen to reason.
A loved all these Westerns.  Have enjoyed the reruns on TVLand, Starz Westerns, and the Hallmark Channel.  But so many of the old Westerns don't hold up well.  I was surprised how well Rawhide and Have Gun, Will Travel hold their quality.  So these are a super addition to any video maven's collection.  Sadly, I don't think Boone ever got the true recognition his talent deserved, but those of us who appreciated him can now watch his talent shine.",1090022400,79,1335,4.462809917355372
137825,5,0792199405,"The first season of HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL is a gem. Unlike the rest of the seasons, the first season was more western. Future seasons played more for drama in a western setting. Here, cattle rustlers, land grabbers and vengeful saloon women are at their worst. ""Hey Boy's Revenge"" which is included with this set was voted by TV GUIDE as one of the 100 best TV shows ever filmed. ""The Great Mojave Chase"" is unique in that the central character is a camel. In ""The O'Hare Story,"" you'll see Andrew McLaglen's father play a lead. Andy was the director of more HGWT episodes than any other director. In ""The Return of Dr. Thackeray,"" Johnny Western plays the role of a young punk who tries to out duel Paladin and gets wounded in the arm. Western would compose a musical ""thank you"" card which later became the theme song.  One slight notice - the theme song ""Ballad of Paladin"" was the closing theme beginning with the second season. A few episodes in this pack have that closing theme which means some are not initial airings (the theme was included in the closing credits meant they are summer reruns after the second season but who's picky?) One recommendation: buy THE HAVE GUN - WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Les Rayburn and Martin Grams on Amazon.com here, it'll give you TONS of trivia like I mentioned above, and makes a great companion piece with the DVD seasons.

137827,4,0792199405,"Most Westerns from the late 1950s and early 1960s, were full of details that are out of time. For example, women's hair-dos and makeup were often quite modern. Have Gun-Will Travel is not free of this nonsense, but you can see the extra effort they made to be accurate by observing the foreground and background objects instead of focusing on the action. The right curtains are on the window, the right dishes and silverware are on the table, and the extras wore clothing made out of the appropriate fabric. And, it doesn't stop there - When Paladin reads a note in Chinese, he reads it top to bottom, right to left. When he reloads his belt with fresh ammunition, he examines each bullet as if his life depends on it (you know the rest). Also, they often got out of the two-dimensional constraints of the studio and shot on location, which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief. Being very modern for its time helps it hold up almost as well as Gunsmoke and Wanted - Dead or Alive. Mr. Boone is better than this role, but I am very glad that he took the part. If you weren't a fan of the series when it originally aired, this might not turn you into one, but if you were a fan (as I was) this is a whole bunch of fun!

The show, which ran on CBS for five seasons beginning in the fall of 1957, starred Richard Boone as Paladin, a badass do-gooder who ran his one-man mercenary business out of a San Francisco hotel.
Unlike most TV Westerns of its time, ""Have Gun"" still plays wonderfully thanks in large part to its savvy scripts. Quite a few were written by Gene Roddenberry, exploring some of the social themes he continued with on ""Star Trek."" Boone looks great, fashion-forward in all black -- hip, intelligent, deadly. Bernard Hermann contributed the swelling music.
The six-disc Paramount set has all 39(!) episodes from the first season of ""Have Gun,"" with guest stars including Jack Lord, Charles Bronson, John Carradine and Warren Oates.

A must have if you like Richard Boone the actor.  The beginning of the show is unique because of the gun pointing at you and Boone doing some great 1 or 2 liners in his raspy voice. Some of the episodes are a little dull but most are excellent.  Too bad they don't have a serious western series like this on TV now.

137831,5,0792199405,"""Have Gun, Will Travel"" is by far the best television western ever broadcast. Broadcast over the Columbia Broadcasting System for six seasons, Richard Boone played the role of Paladin - rather, he created the role of Paladin and explored human falicies with intriguing plots.  The first season, explored in this gift set, offers some of the series's finer episodes including ""The Outlaw"" with Charles Bronson, the tear-jerking Christmas episode ""The Hanging Cross,"" and shocking ""Return of Dr. Thackeray,"" and the fun-filled ""The O'Hare Story.""  The most notable is ""Hey Boy's Revenge"" exploring prejudice between white man and Chinese.  A few years ago TV Guide took a poll to find out what viewers considered the 100 greatest episodes of any TV series.  ""Hey Boy's Revenge"" was on that list!  If you are going to buy this set (which I highly recommend), I also recommend the fact-filled book, ""The Have Gun - Will Travel Companion"" by Martin Grams, Jr. and Les Rayburn, also available on Amazon.com, giving insight to the episodes.  Regrettably, the info booklet included with this set gives nothing along the lines of trivia or background info, but the ""Have Gun Will Travel Companion"" does (including giving a piece of trivia about the theme song composer/singer making a cameo in a first season episode - won't spoil the fun, watch and read for yourself).

But the one that stood out for me was Have Gun Will Travel. Plot driven without being talking heads, HGWT was the most varied, most interesting and best written Western to hit the small screen...and in half hour shows! Gene Roddenberry (Yes, THAT Gene Roddenberry!) was a major contributor to many of the shows, with his being among the best written and most clever.
Richard Boone's performance as the Gunman who tries not use the gun offers a performance in a class all his own; a worldly wise Shakespeare and poetry afficianado who also knows how to dish the dirt to the scum of the Earth.
The DVD's are beautiful! Each episode is crystal clear, and offers a brief note on plot and guest star with each ep.
Whether you remember these shows, or have yet to experience the glory of black and white at it's prime, Have Gun Will Travel is your best bet for the tops in Western TV.",1086220800,9,1112,4.482758620689655
137833,5,0792199405,"While much of TV and movie Western genere is a variously disguised morality play, seeing this first season of Paladin again shows much more depth and historical interest in the West. The series is set during the days of San Francisco's post-Gold Rush up to the Barbary Coast days.
Many of the plots adopt a more complex approach to resolving disputes and conflict than are typical of Westerns. Richard Boone is an actor of uncommon quality in these early series. And the early episodic writing of Gene Roddenberry is consistently the most surprisingly rich in cultural appreciation. Case in point is the Vol. 3 episode 'Helen of Abajinian' with its backdrop of early Abajinian wine growers and farmers in the San Joaquin valley (perhaps inspired by the families pioneering the extensive wineries in San Joaquin valley today).
The Have Gun--Will Travel theme is played out again and again in these episodes that draw on so much more genuine history of early California and elsewhere in the West. That theme is of social justice obtained by unconventional means. It is much better done here than most of the series that followed. There is much variety, good acting, and surprising plots that do not demand that someone die by a climatic gunshot (and a good many that do).
Truly uncommon quality in TV Westerns, and certainly better than many Westerns that followed in later years. Well worth collecting.",1086134400,5,1401,4.940677966101695

Richard Boone was an anomaly among the pretty boys (Tab Hunter/Rock Hudson look-alikes) of the period.  He displayed both acting talent and charisma -- things in short supply during the Happy Days era.
Of all the Fifties Westerns, this is the only one I wanted on DVD -- if you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat! I even purchased the DVD compilations released by Columbia House (4 episodes per DVD) for a price of around $4.00 per show.  This release offers the entire first season for a quarter of the price and with wonderful packaging.  I was very disappointed with the Columbia House pencil-sketch covers (ugly) and very relieved to see that this release was done with all the class befitting this wonderful series.

Many times one has fond memories of the older TV programs. When they are finally distributed and bought, it is a shocker to find that they are sophomoric or just long cigarette commercials. Well this time you will not be disappointed.

Each episode must find a conflict and solve it in an extraordinarily short time. Each with a moral and still maintain the entertainment value. One of the ways this is accomplished is the use of a wide spectrum of writers; many of the stories are adoptions of classics or became classics of other programs and/or movies.

Each episode is accompanied by a synopses of the story, which by the way is very well done and points out the purpose of the story. Also each episode has a small but interesting biography of the main actors.

One of the finer points of this series is that there usually is no clear cut hero or villain as the characters and themes of the stories are as complete as many ancient myths. We can see virtues and faults in everyone and many times there is no such thing as a clear-cut winner or loser.

Paladin (Richard Boone), a well chosen name as on a chess board there are many moves available, lives in San Francisco and most people assumes he has investments all over the west as he is taking frequent trips to protect them. We know different as ""Have Gun Will Travel"" he makes his fortune on his many skills. Every once in a while we get a gimps of his past as we know he went to West Point and can quote many ancient writings and wars. He has an uncanny way of knowing what the meanings of names are. Yet who ever he really is many people are better off for knowing him. And so are we.

A side benefit is recognizing the list of star (actors) and stars in the making.",1504656000,,1760,4.350609756097561

Compared to the other popular TV western stars  of the time, Richard Boone wasn't cute (Steve McQueen, Wanted Dead of Alive) or even ruggedly handsome (James Arness, Gunsmoke). Plus HGWT's hero seemed dull. Silly me. I now realize that I was just too young to get it.  A realistic looking cowboy protagonist who  quotes Shakespeare, philosophers and poets isn't gonna be everybody's cup of tea.

Paladin, perfectly portrayed by the un-handsome, but charismatic and appealing Richard Boone, is mesmerizing and low-key. Educated, refined but not uppity, fair-minded, humane, ethical, smart, quietly brave, quick-witted, independent-thinking, funny, and  BELIEVABLE. HGWT has just the right amount of action. Paladin wields the correct dinner fork and a powerful gun with equal skill and just about the same effort.
