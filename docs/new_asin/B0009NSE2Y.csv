CONTRABAND :
The story was alright, obviously the effects were great, I loved the whole disco music, the score was pretty cool. The film was f*%ken' great in total. I loved it man! Not Fulci's best but definitely a cool flick from the maestro of gore.

CONQUEST:
Now conquest was very interesting. I would have never thought that fulci would have made a movie like this. Not saying that's bad but it seemed very strange to me. First off I thought this film had some cool atmosphere, the effects once again were great and very surprising for this film. It was a pretty fun movie.

If your a fan of Fulci movies then this set is a must have for you.
