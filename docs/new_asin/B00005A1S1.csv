1410646,5,B00005A1S1,"I highly recommend this video to all those interested in being initiated into Reiki or strengthening their healing powers at the Reiki I level. I was fortunate enough to be initiated by a local Reiki Master and at an affordable price but that was it - many of us are then on our own.
After the first few weeks at Reiki I, my healing energy was not flowing as abundantly as it did at first - at times, nothing at all. Later I found out that this is a common experience at the Reiki I level and which is not normally discussed (in actual fact, Reiki will eventually find a practitioner's health weaknesses and divert to heal them, especially if these are chronic conditions, leaving the practitioner apparently 'dry' at times - in my case I have had respiratory problems like bronchitis and asthma since early childhood).
I found this video can provide any number of invaluable 'booster' attunements for a very low cost which strengthen your healing channel and can assist in overcoming these dry periods. This is value-added Reiki!
With the help of this video the frustration of Reiki I dry periods is much more easily overcome than previously and less practitioners will be disillusioned into thinking that Reiki has 'run out' - more Reiki I practitioners, I hope, may wish to continue on to the higher levels.
And I because of my traditional initiation I can testify that these 'on-demand' distance attunements carry the same degree of power and potency that a face-to-face traditional attunement does - there is no doubt about it. In fact, this particular video provides a stronger energy flow through the hands than traditional Reiki I.
Reiki is indeed a developing spiritual technology! Now everyone can afford to receive a genuine attunement anytime and anywhere and experience the life-enhancing wonder that is Reiki!!",1032220800,11,1824,4.887096774193548
1410647,5,B00005A1S1,"All of Steve Murray's programs are wonderful.  Before I put my review on here I read the most recent dated August 17, and then read the other persons reviews that she wrote.  I was amazed at  all her negative reviews.  I understand a person is entitled to their opinions, but what does the person like? I have looked at other reviews of the products she dislikes and there seems to be happy people.  I just would like to know (she being a Reiki Master)what she expected from the attunements?  To feel something, what?  Instant healing- energy rays?  If she is a Reiki Master she should know that Reiki can go to the mental, spiritual and emotional bodies (most of the time where illness starts)and it can take time (depending on the circumstances of the person)to resonate to the physical body. Also people have blockages on some level and they need several attunements. The reviewer also stated she watched the attunement. To do the attunement you have to do it, not just watch it.
Anybody that has worked with Reiki knows it is a subtle and powerful energy and yes somtimes you have a physical sensation. And you don't have to feel anything for the Reiki to work and sometimes it takes time. Most people do not get into an illness state overnight.
The Reiki attunement that this Master said she felt nothing, could be (i believe it is)working on her other bodies.
I know some people have to have a physical confirmation that something has happened for them to believe, but again it sometimes takes time. Apparently this person needs a physical confirmation every time for her to believe in Reiki? Most Masters know this is not true. They trust the Reiki will go where it is needed, feeling or not.
Even though she gave this program a bad review, she did let the truth slip out. Her husband did feel something in his hands (that's a first level attunement),but he was suppose to feel something again with other programs?  I would guess even if he did he would not tell this reviewer in fear of going against her beleif system.
I am also a Reiki Master and teacher and feel their is a need for programs like this. I do understand that some Reiki Masters are against programs like this for various reasons which mostly are personal. And if they embraced a program like this they could lose clients.
Attunements somtimes can take time to manifest healing and change, and they are not a magic bullet. Reiki should be used in conjunction with other healing techniques.
This Reiki Master in her reviews of all the Reiki products maybe she could also find some positive, because i believe all the Reiki products she reviewed were made with good intent to help people.  And of this date August 17, she has not put up anything she has liked.
Ok... I have rambled on. Let me say this, these programs are great tools. I also feel in person attunements are good. It all depends on your circumstances.  I really don't care how you get your attunements, as long as you do.  The more people with Reiki in the world, the better place it will be.

I took both attunements and I'm really happy with the results and the programs have changed my life for the positive.  I understand there is no magic bullet, but the Reiki has made a difference in my life. I did have a few questions about when I should take the attunements again and I contacted Steve Murray.  He did get back with me the next day and answered my questions.  I recommend both these programs.

1410669,4,B00005A1S1,"I began playing around with Reiki because of a woman.  I wonder how many guys reading that just smirked.  Anyways, she was pretty involved in doing energy work and reiki and it was intriguing to me.  So much so that I picked this up after we had already parted ways and found it very interesting.  I haven't kept up with it as much in the past couple of years but I'm much more aware of the world around me and this book was a part of that learning cycle.

1410670,5,B00005A1S1,"At first I was skeptical,but curious, about Reiki so I decided to purchase this DVD. I thought about taking a Reiki class but time\dates were an issue with my schedule. I really enjoyed receiving the attunement and have now purchased several other of Steve Murray's videos. I feel he's a good guy wanting to bring peace and healing to a hurting world. Why shouldn't everyone have access to learning Reiki?",1395446400,2,405,4.8

1410685,5,B00005A1S1,I got this as an open minded sceptic. It really worked. I still want a formal reiki attunment but I live in a conservative area where this stuff just isn't avalible. I was happy to find that it relived some stomach paine that I had about six days after the first attunement. I also couldn't see auras before but now when I channel reiki I see my aura and all natural objects that are in the room. It stops about a minute after I'm finished. I want to try his psyic attunment dvd after I'm done with level 2 and 3.,1332115200,,513,4.089108910891089
1410686,5,B00005A1S1,"So you've come to the point in your process where you're reading the reviews to see that enough people have said it's a great program and really works so you can give yourself permission to go ahead and buy it. My advice after buying the DVD and doing the attunement is just go ahead no matter what your head tells you or other people may say.

THIS PROGRAM WORKS, PERIOD. I did the attunement and can honestly say I am functioning more efficiently, my thinking is much clearer, my intuition of what is correct action is sharper and the attunement produced a great sense of peace.

What did I experience during the attunement? That is something I have decided not to share and here's why: If I share my experiences it may be that some who go ahead and purchase this program will form expectations that they, too, will have the same experiences and sensations as I did. If that doesn't happen for them, and likely won't, the usual reaction will be to think it didn't work and all there is to show for it is an invoice. I will say I found the experience profound and yes there were sensations--physical, emotional and spiritual. My experience was uniquely my own as yours will be yours.

In reality you'd spend more than the cost of this program if you take yourself to lunch at a decent restaurant, order a Cobb salad, and a glass of wine. If you've come this far, just go ahead and do the program and forget what reviewers have written in good and not so good reviews.

An end note is that the DVD is well produced has a wonderfully calming soundtrack, and the instructions are absolutely clear as to what you need to do during the attunement. Go for it.",1312416000,10,1654,4.430921052631579
1410687,5,B00005A1S1,"When I started to think about getting 1st level attunement, I opted to receive it from a Reiki master in my local area. However, the time is always a problem for me as I own a business. Then a friend of mine who are already attuned to 2nd level gave me this wonderful DVD. I was researching on Steve Murray for about a month and when I mentioned it to her, she happened to have the DVD! Of course I was very skeptical about getting the attunement by a DVD, and thought how in the world you can receive the attunement by a DVD, but I was told that the attunement is embedded in the DVD. I understand the concept but I didn't expect that this is going to work. But alas, I DID feel the energy in my palms strongly, though I did not have any other phenomenon. Strange enough, but I feel like clearing the clutters around house since the attunement, and when I intend to use Reiki, I do feel that it is flowing. Now, I believe that the attunement can be received by the DVD, and am looking forward to move up on the level when I feel like I'm ready. I know for sure I'll have the 2nd level attunement by his DVD!",1309392000,5,1108,4.087155963302752
1410688,5,B00005A1S1,"Before finding Steve I was a Reiki II Practitioner and spent $300 on that training.  I was seriously considering paying the $500 to become a Reiki Master when I came upon Steve's DVD's on netflix.  I am now a Reiki Master through Steve's Reiki Master DVD and have recently begun teaching Reiki Classes.  It's been one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I have a master's degree in education and am a former schoolteacher and absolutely LOVE Steve's work and his simple, straightforward presentation style.  My students love his books and the Dvd's provide excellent reinforcement in the classes I teach.  As we move into the 21st Century I believe it's crucial to spread this work as far and as wide and as QUICKLY as we can. It's a shame if this amazing healing technique has been kept from anyone because of the cost of classes.  Raising the consciousness of this planet should be everyone's priority and learning Reiki is one way we can effect a massive shift for many.

1410690,5,B00005A1S1,"I have had wonderful experiences with Steve Murrays attunements. I began with his Reiki Psychic Attunement dvd and after a period of time and several sessions with it, found that my awareness had deepened and my ability to integrate and communicate with my higher self was uber-keen. I then got the level 1 Reiki dvd.
I have noticed that the Reiki flow has been activated and is flowing beautifully. I then got atttuned for 2nd degree and am working with those symbols. Im taking my time and I am keeping to myself about it all- I am a massage therapist and I simply use it when I am called to and use it on myself all the time.
This is a great way to get your feet wet and save yourself time and money with the political agenda of those who wish to control or profit from God's gifts. I do, encourage anyone who buys these dvd's to get the guidebooks and to read the hand placements and other great info on how to best serve with Reiki. Its THAT important, I think, to understand what you are working with.

Combine this with Steve Murray's Reiki Ultimate Guide Volume I, and you can have a good beginning working knowledge of Reiki - certainly sufficient to start using it right away. The book and DVD are the perfect companion pieces.

I was thrilled to get my Steve Murray ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki Healer DVD."" At the time, my sister an I were very interested in Reiki, but could not afford to go to an ""in person"" class. We played the DVD and were both amazed as we could FEEL energy flowing and our hands were HOT. It was a powerful experience for both of us. It prompted me to continue my studies in Reiki, and I continue to this day.

It is so sad that other Reiki practitioners or masters feel the need to denigrate this incredible resource for others. If you want to take an in-person class, by all means do it. But if you cannot afford to go that route, this allows you to get started in the privacy of your own home for far less $$$.

I am a Usui/Tibetan Reiki Master and Karuna Reiki Master. I have had both DVD, book-learned Reiki, and in-person Reiki classes. I can honestly say that I felt NO DIFFERENCE between getting attunements in person versus Steve Murray's distant attunements. Needless to say, we have ALL of Steve Murray's DVD's and books now. I received my first Reiki Master certificate from Steve Murray, which was greatly appreciated. Thank you Steve!

I have been consistently impressed with Steve's straightforwardness and mission to help spread Reiki as far and wide as he can through these products. If you purchase Steve Murray's DVD's, get the distant attunements, and still desire an in-person attunement, and are near the Denver, CO area, please feel free to contact me for an in-person attunement to reinforce the DVD attunement through my email at reikitherapy4u ""at"" gmail ""."" com (run this together and substitute the ""at"" symbol).

This DVD consists of:
1) The guy who put it together talking a little bit, explaining a little about Reiki.
2) The camera pointed at a crystal for about 15 minutes.
3) Showing some sketches of the hand positions for another 10 minutes or so.

It was like a low quality home movie that didn't seem to offer much value.  Maybe my opinion will change after I learn more in the class, in which case I'll update the review.  At this point, however this product seems like a big waste of money and I can't believe the overwhelming number of 5 star reviews for it.

Yes, this DVD is a complete waste of money.  Don't buy it.  It is awful.  If you want to learn Reiki buy anything other than this DVD.",1251849600,11,1135,5.226519337016574

BIG BIG HUGE difference.  Attunement in class had me rocking and I felt energy moving thru me. Almost like a trance which took effort to break.

What was good about DVD is Reiki info. His books are also good resource.

Even if you don't have visions or some grand experience there is always some tangible energy that is working wherever you might need it during the attunement. This energy is fun to play with and fairly strong even at the first level. My experience was subtle but quite profound. Although I have always been aware that everything is but energy, after the attunement I could truly feel it and even see it sometimes. I also felt more interconnected with this energy. I have always healed except now I do it without exhausting myself or spending hundreds of dollars to get the same attunement I did throught his dvd.

So in closing, I would recommend it. Thank you Steve.",1246665600,2,784,4.444444444444445
1410712,5,B00005A1S1,"Reiki is Universal Life Force Healing Energy. It is there for us to use but first you have to be connected or ""plugged in"" to it. This process is called an ""attunement"". Getting the Reiki First Level Attunement via this DVD will make it possible for you to heal yourself, your friends, your family, even your pets. It fits in well with all belief systems but will work just as well even if you're not religious or spiritual. With that said, let me briefly describe this DVD then tell you what sets it apart from others.

This DVD is 30 minutes in length. Steve starts with a very clear description of what Reiki is. Next the attunement process is fully explained. The attunement involves a 15-minute meditation. You begin by relaxing and then you gaze at a beautiful crystal. The setting is the Bell Rock Vortex in Sedona Arizona. There is very pleasant music playing in the background. Before you know it, the process is complete. Next you're shown the Reiki hand positions used to heal others and to heal yourself. You may want to pause the DVD and practice each of them. The first time, I used the DVD by myself. After that, I invited friends to join me. We had no trouble figuring out what to do. The pause and practice method works well. This information is also available in Steve's book ""Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know by Steve Murray"". You can find it by searching Amazon on ""Steve Murray Ultimate Guide"" or by visiting [...] I'm also copying a link at the bottom of this review. You might also consider the Reiki Second Level Attunement DVD. This will enable you to use Reiki symbols for specific purposes such as mental/emotional healing or sending Reiki to others across long distances. There is also a Reiki Master Attunement DVD available. Search ""Steve Murray DVD"" or use the links at the bottom of this review. Keep in mind that you'll want to do these in order.

So what sets these DVDs apart? They work! I did my First and Second Level Reiki attunements in a face to face class about a decade ago. These classes were expensive. The Master level class was so expensive it was unattainable. Some believe that this is the only option. That's what I was taught to believe. (Steve debunks this and other false information about Reiki in his book). I honestly wasn't sure the DVDs would ""work"". I'm pleased to say that they absolutely do. The experience is every bit as real as a face-to-face class. The DVDs are making Reiki available and accessible to everyone without the barriers of cost or location. I believe this is as it was meant to be. I think your experience will be every bit as powerful as mine.

1410713,4,B00005A1S1,"Purchased this after seeing all the great reviews.  I was skeptical, even with so many great reviews, but after receiving this DVD, I am in agreement that it is worth purchasing.

In my opinion, this DVD will not take the place of working one-on-one with somebody who is a Reiki Master and can answer questions you have, but it is a great way to get an overview of Reiki and I appreciate that he has made this accessible to so many people, who would not otherwise have an opportunity to receive this information.

If you are into energy healing and want to know more about Reiki, this is a great DVD to have.",1243209600,2,608,4.3628318584070795
1410724,5,B00005A1S1,I am working on my master's in mental health counseling. I will be using methods like meditation and Reiki in my practice. In the past people marketed Transcendental Meditation (TM) to make large sums of money. The concept of meditation was good but using it to bilk large sums of money from others was just wrong. Reiki is at a crossroads. People must decide if it is to be used just as a money making scheme or for the betterment of mankind. The concept of Reiki works. It has helped many people. But like TM some see Reiki as a way to make large sums of money off others. Steve Murray has taken Reiki and made it available to everyone at a fair price. His books and tapes work. Bravo Steve!,1240531200,,693,4.297709923664122
1410725,5,B00005A1S1,"I have most of Steve's DVD Attunements and they do work and pass the Attunements and are not jokes. If you want to take advice from a person from who admits practicing the occult and magick and wants you to read an occult book that's up to you. Reiki is your life force, it's not the occult or magick. It is also interesting the reviewer says long distance Attunements work, but of course he does not like the method Steve uses.

If you want to feel the energy and use it for yourself and others, try reading some occult, like Golden Dawn teachings. If you want to deal with Reiki go get a proper attunement...staring at an image on a DVD it's not what I call attunement..it's not even an initiation. Long distance attunements would work but not like that. Where is the participation? Where are the visualizations necessary to receive any kind of energy?

1410727,5,B00005A1S1,"What can I say about Steve Murray and his work... I have been a Reiki practitioner for over a decade, and I can tell you that Steve's books and DVDs are among my most treasured possessions on my book case. I see his work benefiting both existing Reiki practitioners and those just looking to get started.

Steve's books are like GOLD, as they are actually more comprehensive than the materials provided by most Reiki masters to their students. I am sure that many Reiki Masters must be upset with Steve, as he divulges information that most Reiki Masters believe to be secret, including all the symbols up to Master Level, and the attunement processes. Most Reiki books do not include this information, and have been very disappointing to me.

After buying his first book, I decided, after reading the reviews, I needed to own the others. I currently have all 5 Reiki guides and the Reiki myths book. And, of course, the package would not be complete without the DVDs.

I would say, though, that although the first book is excellent, it is not enough for me. I needed the Visual of the DVDs to bring it all home. So, I don't think that you can buy a single book, read it, and walk away a Reiki Master. Each of his books and DVDs, however, complements the others. With the combination of the Books, DVDs, studying and practice, you CAN BECOME A REIKI MASTER.

What's awesome about the DVDs is that you can take the attunements over and over again. As someone who was attuned in person by a Reiki Master over a Decade ago, I can attest to the DVD attunements as being every bit as effective as in person.

My only criticism is that the whole package should be sold as a complete set, as once you get started, you will want the whole set anyway. However, I guess that most will not want to plunk down that money (even though it is completely reasonable in the scheme of things) without first experiencing the quality of it with the first book.

If you are interested in Reiki, and don't want to waste your time and money with disappointments, just get this material, and you will not regret it.",1238371200,5,2091,4.489473684210527

I commend him for making a powerful healing tool available to so many people",1238025600,2,295,4.784313725490196
1410729,1,B00005A1S1,"I found this a disappointment after a lot of study, I chose this as the way for my attunement as I can not attend the reiki school in Orlando. It was not only a big fat zero it made it difficult for me to do my regular energy exercises.",1236038400,2,236,3.836734693877551
1410730,5,B00005A1S1,"I like Steve Murray's books and DVD's because they are written by a man who truly believes in Reiki and what Reiki can do for everyone. Steve's introduction is quite honest and I know of others who share this philosophy and dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.

What these books and DVD's can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements both receiving and giving. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements.  As for the complaints for not having the traditional hand placements he clearly states the philosophy behind his reasons to give treatment to specific places of the body and why.  This made sense to me and as I know every practitioner is not the same.  Getting the traditional placements online is easy.

I also felt the attunement dvd's or video's Steve Murray has available are amazing. They are wonderful, life altering, and being absolutely blessed experience. Reiki is for everyone willing to learn and he provides it.  Thanks for not coloring inside the lines.

1410731,5,B00005A1S1,"I have nothing but great things to say about Steve Murray's program.  All his books are well-written, to the point, and very informative.  I also agree that if you can send someone long-distance Reiki, it only follows that you could send someone a long-distance attunement.  I was fortunate enough to be able to do both a Reiki 1 seminar in person, and Steve Murray's Reiki 1 DVD attunement with his books.  Both taught the same information about the history of Reiki, what Reiki is and isn't, and how attunements are given.  The only difference is that in the seminar we were shown how to give Reiki to self and others and had the opportunity to practice quite a few times.  I think that if Steve Murray could make a DVD with a demonstration of giving a full Reiki session to self and to others, that would make his program complete in my opinion.  However, you can purchase William Lee Rand's `The Reiki Touch' set and that comes with a DVD demonstration.  There is not an attunement in that set because they are of the belief that attunements must be done in person.  The in- person attunement and  Steve Murray's DVD attunement felt the same to me and I plan to do Reiki 2 and Master Reiki through Steve Murray.  He also can send you a really beautiful certificate for each level you complete!",1221091200,3,1297,4.523605150214593

I am by nature open minded but cautious. I read Steve's website top to bottom and was inspired by the truth as I read it. It resonated with something deep inside me. I was very drawn to his openness and perspectives on Reiki and decided that this was the right path to follow. I have not been disappointed at all!! Very congruent in all his writing and his mission statement.
His DVD's and books empower you on whatever level you are interested in learning. He is a true teacher. You can read it, see it and feel the energy.
Thank you so much Steve for all your insightful information and for sharing all your knowledge with everyone in an affordable way. This was a smart investment for me. I am truly grateful and much more knowledgeable.",1219795200,2,753,4.5036496350364965
1410733,5,B00005A1S1,"I have studied Reiki with teachers in person and online for over 10 years.  THIS DVD was the first time I found myself trusting in the process of energy passing from one moment to another for the sake of ""attunement"" or the like.  There was something magickal about the idea that I had to trust in this process due to it being a DVD and not a human standing right next to me.  Most humans charge an arm and a leg simply to stand there anyway - and not much can happen that way either.  It's true, not all people are going to have the same wonderful experience that I [and others] did.  This is simply what Reiki is all about, each of us having a togetherness connection to the Reiki Energy source itself, while ALSO having our own experiences learning about how to harness and use it.  This is what I've learned most from Steve; his books and DVD's have opened my heart and mind like no other Reiki teacher I've worked with.  I'm very happy I bought and took his courses.",1219708800,2,971,4.273224043715847

The attunements were very powerful, and the energy flow is no doubt stronger. This program has to be the most convent, and realistic way to get started in the Reiki healing practice. I have tried several other Reiki programs in the past, and Steve Murrays Reiki Ultimate Guides, are the very best I have found yet. You will not be disappointed.

Suffice it to say that those Reiki recipients whom I have been working with for some time have commented that they notice an increase in Reiki power -- and they didn't know that I had been doing further study with Steve Murray's Usui Reiki system products; they simply knew something was different. As a newly-signed author myself, I love his writing style; Steve is straight to the point without unnecessary wording --- I like and appreciate that.
Steve Murray's books and DVDs and absolutely priceless and will remain in my personal library as invaluable reference materials in the years to come.

1410737,5,B00005A1S1,"I have always had healing energy but in 2004 I began to read Steve Murray's books and receiving his attunements by his DVD programs.  It works.  Beginning with - Reiki The Ultimate Guide, he teaches his students about the Reiki sacred symbols & attunements and becoming a Reiki Healer.  I received my attunement for 1st Level Reiki  from Steve's DVD program.  After that I went on and received attunements for the 2nd Level and read his books - Reiki Ultimate Guides 2 & 3.  Steve Murray's method of explaining the sacred symbols and attunements makes it easy to understand and he hides nothing from his students.  His book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed For All shows how honest he is with his students.  I  bought his DVD and received the attunement to become a Reiki Master, but waited until I felt ready.  First I bought the DVDs - Reiki 1st Aura and Chakra Attunement and Reiki Healing Attunement - Heal Emotional - Mental - Physical - Spiritual Issues and received these attunements.  Afterwards, I felt ready, and received the Master Attunement by Steve's DVD program.  Steve's program is thorough and easy to understand, and his unique way of teaching is effective.  The knowledge and attunements have been helpful for me while on my own spiritual journey.  I would recommend Steve Murray's programs for anyone that is interested in becoming a Reiki healer or in expanding their own knowledge and intensifying their abilities as an energy healer.  Steve Murray leaves no stone unturned, and will leave you feeling enlightened, and stronger as an energy healer.",1213401600,,1565,4.897338403041825
1410738,5,B00005A1S1,"I have read all of Steve's books, taken the attunements from his DVDs and listen to the CDs with the subliminal attunement enhancements. I am a huge fan and I have found that all his ""products"" have helped me a great deal. It's not quite accurate to call them products, however, as they are really vechicles for the trasmission of energy; from Steve directly to you.  Some Reiki teachers may object to this method, but their reasons don't make sense.  It has become almost common knowlege now (Eckhart Tolle on Oprah) that the now encompasses the past and the future.  When Steve opens a DVD by telling you that he has created a connection with you it is happening right then and there just as validly as if he was in the room with you.  The attunements you receive from the DVDs are real and you will feel the difference in your Reiki energy.  I am not telling you not to take attunements from Steve or from others in person, of course you should.  You should also watch Steve's attunement DVDs over and over.  You will find them a powerful meditation in addition to the other benefits you receive.",1211587200,,1099,4.492462311557789
1410739,5,B00005A1S1,"After being attuned to the 3 Reiki DVD's, I tried it out on 1 of my massage clients. He was more than willing to be my Guniea pig. I asked him not to tell me if anything was wrong, I wanted to see if I could figure it out on my own. While i was performing the session, i felt tingling going all over my hands & going up my arms. I wasn't sure if it was the Reiki or if my hands were falling asleep from holding them up for so long. They tingled all over his body. When our breif session (maybe about 15 minutes) was over, I asked him if he was sore all over. He responded, ""Yes! How did you know?"" I told him, ""I just knew."" Still not sure if it was the Reiki, his wife, who is a dear friend, reinforced it for me. She said, ""He said he NEVER felt anything like it in his life. He never felt such heat generated from something that wasn't touching his body."" I believe this is proof that the Reiki Steve's teachings and attunements work.

His books are so helpful in answering questions that he didn't have time for on the DVD's. So far, my favorite is the ""False Beliefs"" book. I started out with that book. The others reiterate it & therefore, I believe make the Reiki stronger because you can understand it better. Steve is a wonderful teacher and is so helpful in answering your questions. There is no doubt in my mind that he is an even better teacher in person. If I had the money to visit him in California, I would. He is a very special person.  BDB",1211500800,,1457,4.073170731707317

I can go back at anytime to study the information. This way I learn it even better and grow with it. I can't go back to a class unless I pay BIG DOLLARS!!! This is well worth it, it teaches you the same thing a class does. When I did the first attunment I truly felt something, more than I did at a class. It give me more consentration being by myself so I get the real feeling. It's amazing. I now have my Master through this wonderful program.",1211155200,,613,3.991869918699187

I still felt something was missing and finally found that ""glowing energy"" seen in my dreams when I discovered Reiki energy. If you are a healer or on a spiritual journey, then Reiki is for you.
 There has been a lot of controversy on whether or not distant attunements work. After you attain your Reiki II level and are given the symbols, you can send distant healing into the past, present and future (and even into past lives). So, it stands to reason that attunements can be ""sent"" via a DVD. Time is not linear, but loops back upon itself (simple physics), so any attunement, given with intent, can be received in the ""now"". When you receive the attunements via Steve Murray's DVDs, you will receive Reiki that will totally change your life. Start slow with Reiki I and II attunements and allow the energy to increase with time and practice and your ability to process it. Read Murray's excellent books to learn about Reiki and understand what attunements are and what you are receiving. Learn the symbols and the techniques. When you feel you are ready to teach or pass attunements on your own, then take the Master attunement.
  I had been practicing as a Reiki II for almost 10 years and wanted to advance to a Reiki Master, but never had the opportunity to take a class. After Steve Murray's Master Reiki attunement via the DVD, the energy in my hands went from a comfortable warmth to what feels like an electrical current, and my clients feel a big difference, too.
  Do DVD attunements work? You bet.

1410742,5,B00005A1S1,"I have many of Steve Murray Reiki DVDs, and they are the best. The Reiki DVDs do pass the Reiki Attunements very well. And the Reiki Books are very informative and easy to understand. I love the photos and drawings in the books because it makes what he explains very easy to comprehend.

From reading the reviews of the few people who do not like him because of his books and DVDs, it looks like to me these are the Reiki people he writes about in his Reiki False Beliefs Exposed for all. LOL no wonder they dislike him and his work. He has exposed them and they are angry. It is this small group of people who only want you to learn Reiki their way, because they think their way is the only way, and they are always right. And by coincidence it's usually the most expensive way to learn Reiki, and with them giving classes.

The big difference between Mr. Murray and his detractors is that he teaches you can learn Reiki many ways and his teachings are one option; just make your own decision with learning Reiki with what works the best for you. Every person has Reiki naturally. What books, DVDs and classes show you is how to use it for yourself and others. In fact some people use Reiki successfully without any guidance or teachings. Most of Mr. Murray's critics do not want you to know this either.

From reading a few of Mr. Murray's reviews it seems he has changed people's lives around the world, so he is doing a good thing. Mr. Murray's Reiki teachings are not for all, but at least he is open minded to know this, and would never tell you his Reiki path is the only correct one.

1410743,2,B00005A1S1,"You obviously cannot learn Reiki thoroughly through Steve Murray.
Wonder why Steve Murray is about the only Reikimaster who prefers to teach people this way? Because he is NOT serious about helping students learn, fully understand and use Reiki for the highest benefit. Most students will be much better off taking a real Reiki 1+2 class with a certified and qualified teacher because there is a lot of extras that go with being a competent Reiki practitioner that cannot be found in Murray's inadequate books. Almost anywhere in the world you can find a good Reikimaster, who can teach you a lot better than Steve Murray if you go look for it. Don't learn Reiki in a deflated discount way and then think you have Reiki and are a good practitioner - because there is so much more to Reiki. If money is the problem you can find a teacher and a class that is affordable for you and which will be well worth it in advancing your ability to use Reiki and be of service to others and help them heal.

Almost anyone who takes a real class has profound changes that can only be considered a magnificent Reiki-blessing. Take no short cuts. Reiki must be learned properly if you are to realize just how close you are to the devine and how rewarding it is to be of service to others.

The books are clear and concise, containing all the information a Reiki person of any level shoul be able to find ( sadly that does not happen due to the secrecy and vested interest of some people in the Reiki world).

The DVDs are fatastic tools ( they are as powerful as in person attunements, and who say the contrary does not really understand the mechanics of Reiki or does not want to).

It is true that the books do not contain pictures of standard hand positions or the history of Usui Sensei and Mrs Takata ( but every other single book in the market does, so I truly understand Steve Murray not needing to repeat then once again and concetrate in the material that so far has been kept hiden for not a very good reason at all).

1410758,5,B00005A1S1,"Steve Murray's Reiki books are well worth purchasing, whether you are a beginner wishing to learn, or an intermediate student looking for reference material. His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.

The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.

I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.

I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism.",1196208000,,1561,4.8830188679245285

I had questions about Reiki that my Reiki Master couldn't answer, and so, I didn't feel confident to go out into the world and practice Reiki in a professional setting.  I knew that clients would ask me questions that I, like my Reiki Master, wouldn't be able to answer.  So, I prayed for guidance and asked to be directed to someone who could help me.

Not long after my prayer, I found Steve Murray purely by accident.  I had gone into a bookstore in Sedona, AZ and on a shelf in front of me was his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD.  I was a little skeptical at first, since my Reiki Master had told me that attunements needed to be received in person, but something about his creative use of Reiki intrigued me, so I purchased the DVD, along with Steve's ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" DVD, and I still can't believe the results I received!

I received such powerful attunements from his DVD's!!  I had always been psychic with natural healing abilities, but his attunements seemed to amplify my skills even more!  I began having consistent clairvoyant visions after taking his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD, and I received almost instant healing of some stress related conditions, I had been dealing with for some time, shortly after taking his ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", from his DVD.  The results I received were nothing short of miraculous!  I definitely knew then that there was power in his DVD attunements!  And that attunements didn't have to be taken in person in order to be effective!

So, I purchased all the rest of his DVD's and Books and have never been disappointed!!  His Books are written so clearly and concisely that anyone, no matter what their educational background can understand them .  Steve is very generous with the wealth of information he provides in both his Books and his DVD's , and when I was finished (reading his books and taking his attunements) I truly felt I had finally attained a solid foundation from which to practice Reiki professionally.

I ended up finishing my Reiki Master with Steve Murray, and I truly feel it's the best decision that I have ever made!  All my questions about Reiki have finally been answered through his Books and DVD's and I feel so grateful to have found him!

If you are interested in Reiki education, there is no better person to work with than Steve Murray!  I have read many, many Reiki authors and there is no one that comes close!  I am convinced, that the results you'll receive, from Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's, will truly astound you!  As they have truly astounded me!  I don't care what anyone says, distance attunements really work!!!

My dream has been, for sometime now, to practice Reiki professionally, but I was afraid to, because I didn't feel I had all my questions answered. I didn't feel I had a solid foundation from which to work from, but now, because of Steve Murray's Books and DVD's, I feel that I finally have the knowledge and confidence necessary to succeed!  Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's have truly made my dream a reality!  And for that, I will be forever grateful to him!

Whether your goal is to work professionally with Reiki, or to use it to heal and enhance your everyday life, you can't go wrong with Steve Murray's Books and DVD's.  They are truly worth the investment!  I know I will be referring to them for reference, and reinforcement, for many years to come!  God bless Steve Murray!",1195344000,4,3575,4.646496815286624
1410760,5,B00005A1S1,"Bravo to Steve Murray for a job well done in bringing Reiki to those folks who want and need Reiki in their lives at a very reasonable cost.  I think Reiki classes are just fine too, but the most important reasons that Steve's Murray's Books and especially Attunement DVD's are important to me are the affordable costs and the fact that you can take the attunements over and over again via the DVD's as many times as you like.  This is the main reason I am very, very happy and satisfied with these DVD's.  They really work! And each time I re-attune myself again I feel better, become more aware and conscious to who I am, what I want and especially become and feel more connected to my SOURCE ENERGY, and I think this is what life is all about.  Steve Murray's books and DVD's have made a big difference in my life.  And I wholeheartedly recommend these books and DVD's to anyone who is interested in personal growth and living life to the fullest.

1410761,5,B00005A1S1,"Here's my story. I didn't want to get any of his books or dvds. I read some of the reviews from other Master's and they talked badly about his teachings and how an attunement could not be done by watching a crystal on dvd. But, later i remembered having a dream when i was younger of watching myself staring at a crystal on tv. I thought it was freaky and didn't know what it meant, but then it all came together. So i started off with his first reiki book, the psychic attunement, and the reiki level one attunement. I had better results than i thought i was going to get. I have a natural gift for healing and i've been using it un-trained my whole life. His books and dvds helped me out a lot. This is the real thing and if you are new and looking to try reiki, i highly recommend it. I don't write reviews and Steve Murray is the first review i've ever written on. This is because i want people to know that this is real and powerful. The DVD's are powerful and the books explain it all and enforce all that is Imparted to you. By the way, I am a Christian and you should know that Reiki has no religion. I recommend all the DVD attunements, and i've read the first 3 Reiki volume set and the false beliefs. I will be getting more of his books and teaching. But i hope that this review and his works help you like it's helped me in my entire life and the people around me. I've healed things from headaches and back pains, to two different friends that were in the hospital death bed, one with severe kidney failure and the other had AIDS and i helped bring his status down to a controlled HIV status. Both were overnight. night saying it will work like that for everybody, but know that it will work in it's own way, some way. Be blessed all who read this.",1189987200,5,1761,4.152046783625731
1410762,5,B00005A1S1,"This DVD is a gift, a total gem. It did everthing it said it would and I was completely aware of the transformation as it occurred. I am aware of the Reiki circulating through my hands and body in a way that I was not before this DVD. Again, many thanks!",1187395200,,254,4.0

Namaste.

1410774,5,B00005A1S1,"I would like to thank Steve Murray for providing these Reiki attunement programs.  I have received 1st and 2nd degree from his products and also from a live class.  The experiences were very different but both were wonderful. I have not been able to raise the $1,000 required for my Masters Attunement from the organization that I received my live 1st and 2nd from but Steve has made it very affordable to receive the attunement.  I have read some of the reviews and see that one or two have been upset because they didn't feel anything.  I don't know what they expected to feel but Steve does explain that if you can't feel anything it does not mean that you did not receive the attunement.  I have definitely been able to tell that I have received the Master Attunement even though I didn't ""feel"" that much while receiving the attunement.

I definitely recommend that anyone taking his attunements also read his Ultimate Guide Trilogy.  They are so packed with information about Reiki that I feel so much more prepared to be a Reiki healer than I did prior to reading them. They are truely wonderful and his A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra DVD is very helpful in showing you how to perform your own attunements.  Reiki False Beliefs Exposed is very good in answering questions you might have about things you have heard about Reiki and setting the record straight in many areas.  I also have had Steves Psychic attunement and the wonderful thing about his programs is that you can take them over and over again and that is something you can't do with a live attunement.  Of course, you need to follow Steve's cautions in waiting three days between pschic attunements.  I believe that taking the Reiki Healer attunements over and over can continue to improve my abilities to be a better healer.",1186531200,,1793,4.6424050632911396
1410775,3,B00005A1S1,"I'm open but so far the DVDs don't have a lot ""meat"" to them. Steve Murray is a very good, clear narrator/speaker and has great presence. There is a good amount of recycled material in the DVD. I would have felt better paying about $10 for each DVD I purchased. I'm going to try a couple more and get myself inline with what should be coming through.",1183593600,,350,4.2388059701492535
1410776,2,B00005A1S1,"I had already done some reserach on Reiki, online and in books.  I read all of the wonderful reviews of this DVD and ordered it.  I found a quiet place, sat down and watched the DVD, expecting to receive the attunement.  I felt nothing, except my feet fell asleep from sitting on the floor.  I reserved judgement, knowing that Steve said that you might not feel anything (but also listed all of the impressive things you would PROBABLY feel).  I gave myself Reiki.  I felt nothing... nada.  I could feel no evidence of this amazing energy flowing through me. I gave Reiki to my husband, who said it was relaxing, but he didn't feel any ""energy"" and I felt nothing while I was giving it.. no sense that any ""energy"" was moving through my hands.

I watched the attunement the next day, in a quiet meditation room, alone, with great intent.  I felt nothing.  I still gave myself Reiki, but never felt anything.  I gave my husband another treatment.  He didn't feel anything either.

I have signed up for a Reiki class.  Maybe I just need to get the attunement in person. Either that, or the statements I have read over and over that you don't even need to believe in Reiki for it to work, it will just ""flow"" out of your hands automatically when you get an attunement, and it will ""change your life"" are all just a bunch of hooey.

I prefer to believe that I just need the class.

Maybe I'll watch the DVD again later after I get an attunement in person and find that it really does do something, I don't know.",1179360000,15,1507,4.366906474820144
1410777,5,B00005A1S1,"I have read four of Steve's books and used his DVD series for attunements.  (These were in addition to previous attunements [by other people] that I had experienced ""in person"".)  My strong feeling is that Steve's video attunement was purer than my prior in-person attunements.  There was no hidden agenda and no personal dynamics playing into the attunement.  His intention is clear - to share Reiki energy and attunements with all who wish to have them. A major difference for me in receiving the Reiki attunements in this manner is that I, as the one seeking attunement, had to choose to completely own the energy & responsiblity that comes with an attunement.  With my face-to-face attunments, I could let the Master do her thing, and she is the one who said, ""you are ready"".  With Steve's attunement, I had to be introspective and explore my own beliefs and get to the point of self-empowerment where I was the one who could say, ""I am really ready"".

Steve's Reiki guides are all packed with readily usable information - and for those of us who are visual learners, he has photographs for every step of Reiki treatments, attunements, symbols...for whatever the topic of his book is. A bonus is that there is a quote from a wise person preceeding each chapter - Rumi, Buddha, Confucius, etc.

In addition to the valuable written/video resources, I have found Steve to be accessible (via email/phone) and a person of integrity (he refunded my overpayment on PayPal without me asking).

I highly recommend his books & DVDs for those new to Reiki, and to those who have Reiki experience - this is great tangible, clear, complete reference material.

I can Beam and Scan, and can protect myself from Psychic Debris, this was the hardest for me to achieve.  I have used Reiki on myself, many of my friend, several who are Reiki Healers. My sister who is a Reiki Healer,  My husband, who was sceptic, has also recieved and been helped by me with Reiki.  I am a Registered Nurse, and work in a Post Anesthetic Care Unit.  I have helped many, many of my patients (with their permission).  I have been practicing Reiki for many years, without formal education.  I have read several other books on Reiki in the past, but it was not until after I received the Attunements with your DVD's, and read your books that I noticed a huge improvement in my skill, and I truly felt complete.",1173484800,3,835,4.4183006535947715

After reviewing all four books (Reiki Ultimate Guide Volumes 1-3 and Reiki False Beliefs Exposed For All) I found that the sections on psychic sugery (Volume 2) and the entire book(Volume 3) about aura attunements really grabbed my interest the most.  I plan on using the aura attunements where I can in my practice, starting with myself.  I am also interested in the Reiki Healing Attunements because when I was taught my level 1 and level 2 we didn't really have such things, it was a more hands on, balancing with specific spot healing when needed.  I like the approach of using the chakra's and appreciated the layout you gave for the chakra's and their associated physiological areas.  Again, very useful.  These books and the 3 DVD attunements have totally changed my perspective about my practice of Reiki.  I can truly see why you term these volumes as a Toolbox.  I would suggest that any serious Reiki Practitioner should read and re-read these as they are definitely applicable to the 'real world' applications of Reiki.

I want to become a more effective channel for this Universal Energy which I know can heal people and make their lives more productive.  This is just the beginning; I know everywhere there are people who have something to offer but need a bit of healing which I am going to be able to provide, thanks to Steve's wonderful work making this magical ability accessible.

There is invisible power here, I can feel it.  I will be taking the 2nd level attunement soon and can hardly wait to see what that brings.",1171584000,4,774,4.532374100719425

1410785,5,B00005A1S1,"Steve Murray's video attunement program really works!  I took all of my Attunements through Steve Murray's Video program.  The reason I know his program works is because when I give Reiki treatments to others, I always get positive feedback.  Also, when I first took each Attunement, I definitely felt the Energy all around me shift in a positive way.  When I took the Reiki Level 1 Attunement, it felt as if any blockages was lifted from me and I began to giggle very giddy like, and it is not like me to do that.  I also felt the Reiki Level 2, and Master were just as powerful.  I have been studying the Healing Arts for many years, but when I took Steve's Attunements, that is when I felt the greatest shift of Energy in and around my body.  In my opinion, I feel these video programs will change your life for the Better, they have with me and everyone around me.  I recommend them to any one I know that is wanting to get into the Healing Arts,  whether it is to just heal themselves, friends and family, or to do Reiki as a profession.  These Videos are a very powerful catalyst into Energy Healing.  Thank you Steve, keep up the good work I a firm believer in your video attunement program, and am very proud to have you as the Reiki Master that did all of my attunements.  I use many of your other products and I will continue to use any thing you put out, because I know that what you teach is Truth, and nothing Else.  Thanks",1168473600,3,1436,4.274074074074074

I immediately went ahead and took the next attunement.  It's amazing how many friends and family members start lining up once they know you've been attuned!  Thanks to the books and DVD's I was able to channel the energy.  I even gave myself the Reiki Aura Attunement for smoking and I'm happy to say that I've been able to drastically cut back!  The Master Attunement was the icing on the cake.  Steve's attunements are GREAT and I highly recommend that anyone interested in persuing reiki healing read his books and take his attunements.  There is no reason to spend hundreds of dollars for an attunement all anyone needs is Steve Murray's Course (Books and DVD's).

1410789,5,B00005A1S1,"I ordered Steve Murry's DVD's after already having been Attuned to Level 1 & 2 by a Reiki Master... I wish I had found these DVD's first. They are State of the Art and perfect in length - I experienced the Attunements and had wonderful experiences, they really do work. If you order his books they complement the CD's and his entire program is hundreds of dollars cheaper then any place else, plus you get to keep the DVD's and rewatch them for reinforement later on. He also has a Pychic DVD that really opened me up to new experiences.

I just finished reading all three of Steve Murray's Reiki Ultimate Guide Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 & 3 ...

Vol. 2 & 3 go deeper into using Reiki via Chakras, and the Aura...

These books don't just talk about Reiki they teach you how to apply it

and in several ways, so you can treat those you love, or your clients in a way that is suited to their needs... I wish I had come upon these books first as they are really all that is needed in any Reiki book shelf.

Not to mention once you are a Reiki Master you have his first book that

teaches you; with easy step by step (photos included) on how to pass these

Attunements to others, so you can become a Reiki Master/Teacher as well...

I'm excited to try all the new techniques I've learned - and there are many within the pages, and best yet there are photos with detailed information embedded in them to better help you perform your Reiki Sessions. Another thing I love about this series is you will never get bored of Reiki as your not doing the same thing for each person - which is how it should be in any healing technique.

Steve Murray also teaches in a simple to understand manner and there

is no arrogance involved. I feel his books are inspired to help those of

us that are having trouble finding a Reiki Master or learning Reiki, as he

is open and upfront and doesn't leave anything out.

I bought his DVD's as well, and they are state of the art - so if your having trouble finding a Reiki Master (like I did), then this series is

exceptional. I've been attuned in person by a Reiki Master and via: Steve

Murray's DVDs--and I can say I wish I had found Steve Murray's first as it would have saved me tons of money. Not mention I have the books to refer back to without wondering after My Reiki Master leaves the house, what I'm supposed to do with all the information (and unanswered questions)...

Plus you can get your certificate through his program, and I still don't have mine from my Reiki Master, nor is it easy to reach her as a lot of people seem to have this trouble - making it another great reason to Turn to Steve Murray - as the answers are always there and he has a great support website and even answers my e-mails... And the bonus is; the Certificates really do arrive...

I've enjoyed these programs and I truly believe I was brought to them via

""Divine intervention"" which paved the way for me to find what I was searching for... Whatever you decide in your search for Reiki and it's teachings, may the Universal Life Force energy grace your path...",1164931200,4,3072,4.294627383015598
1410790,5,B00005A1S1,"Each one of the books and DVDs by Steve Murray are a must have for all on the healing path. Great for the beginner, explaining not only ""how to do"" but also the ""why"" of Reiki.  Each book gives more detail than I received in years of study and practice (a must is the Ultimate Guide 3 for the auras).  I go back to them time and time again. The most concise information in one place I have read (and I've read alot).

The DVDs are truly profound. They work! The blessings you receive from them will make you want to see them over and over again.  (but get the books that go with each one so you understand what you have just been given).

Wish I would have known these were available when I was searching for a class on Reiki healing - a beautiful one on one way to learn.",1164844800,3,772,4.052631578947368
1410791,4,B00005A1S1,"This is a great DVD to bring reiki into your life. Watching it once a month strengthens the reiki flow. It's worked to heal others of their headaches, kidney stones, muscle pains, high blood pressure, etc. It could very well be the cure to whatever it is that is hurting your loved ones. I'm not saying to use this instead of going to have surgery or getting a checkup from a doctor, I'm saying use it to alleviate the problem, and with faith, the sickness will also go away.

This DVD get's 4 stars instead of 5 because there's no practical advice on how to use reiki. Since I had some prior experience with raising and manipulating energy before I got this, it came easily to me on how to apply it. So for a good book on this, I reccomend astral dynamics by Robert Bruce. It's a very important book on energy work that should be read and practiced by any reiki healer.

Here's some practical advice: Reiki is not an intelligent energy, contrary to what we are told, so it will not look for the source of the problem if the problem is, say, kidney stones. For high blood pressure there's not much need to look for the affected area, but for other things it's very necessary. The hands must be placed over the affected area to work properly, and repeat sessions are a must. You, the healer, will most probably begin to feel pains in one or both of your hands, like cramps, which means you've found the problem. Depending on the amount of pain the person is in, that's how much you will feel. This is a sacrifice that must be made in order to give a good healing. It's much more effective than believing the reiki will simply find all problems and the patient will be healed. This is nonsense. Also, creative visualization of the energy (green is a good color for healing) flowing inside the person helps alot too, along with rythmic breathing on both the healer and the patient. Imagining the energy is being pulled down, through your head, down to your heart, and out your arms is a good technique. Imagine the energy feels like cool water and that a sponge is brushing it down inside you and out your arms. This will feel like a subtle (or strong) rush of adrenaline. Even if you don't feel it, believe it's working, never doubt it, and it will work. Sensitivity to energy comes later.

1410792,5,B00005A1S1,"Recently while searching for some music, I came across Steve Murray's DVD programs for attunement. First impression was that, this must be fake. As it was in total contradiction to the learning's I learnt during my Reiki 2nd degree in India. I went on to read the reviews and none of the reviews were negative. All people including some Reiki masters were in praises for Steve's program. I took the chance and ordered his first book, 1st cd and DVD attunement for 2nd degree. I wanted to take this again for reinforcement and to give my wife 2nd degree who was a 1st degree. (My intention was to try his claim first before I venture into a master attunement of Reiki through DVD)

 Last week I received the dvd and the first thing was to play the dvd to see myself, if it works. It did work. It was a very powerful attunement & I received it all through a DVD, isn't it amazing.. Immediately after that my wife took the attunement and she also felt extreme heat and tingling sensation. Now she is a 2nd degree and her Reiki is flowing beautifully. The first line of his book, which says ""I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now"". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. When I played his attunement cd part 1, I felt a gentle shower of Reiki all over me. Its playing right now and I can feel Reiki all around me. Since then I have taken both 1st & 2nd degree attunements a couple of times and every time I feel an increase in my energy levels. I feel my hearing ability has increased; now I can pick up sounds quite far from me. My smelling ability has increased, my concentration and consciousness has increased too.

 Giving attunements like this proves that Reiki works in past present and future all layered together. This even supports the string theory proposed by Einstein and the 11 dimensions we live in. probably Reiki works in all those 11 dimensions just by our intent. Steve has done a great think to mankind by his video programs. He is in fact a time traveler who travels forward and backwards in time by his Reiki and gives the attunement to us whenever we watch his videos and listen to his cds. His attunements on Dvd cost just 30 whereas taking a master attunement cost $1,000 in India and up to $10,000 in US. He has made Reiki available to the masses virtually at no cost. This way more and more people can use this power and be healed and heal others. Reiki is a free gift from the supreme power and should be available for masses. I honor his Reiki mission which is to spread Reiki to everybody for their betterment.

I also ordered his subliminal programs; currently I am using Quit Smoking and Stress relief. Only 3 days have passed doing these programs. I already feel that my stress levels are going down. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood. Next weekend I will be taking my master level attunement and I feel so happy about it.

I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)"" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being. From there it will depend on your fate and your karma. But at least let your body experience it once. I can bet that this might be the best investment you can ever make in your entire life.

Reiki is beyond what we think of it, to truely know the power of Reiki is to go beyond what we claim to think of Reiki.  To the believe that distant attunement cannot work by medium other than physical close location is an illusion, the same illusion that separates us.  Every act and every being that has ever been will be or is, is now, such is the focus of Reiki or love.  I truely recommend this product to everyone.",1155254400,5,489,4.170212765957447

1410805,5,B00005A1S1,"I discovered a whole new world through Reiki. Steve talks and walks us through each step, so that anyone can receive his Attunements with ease.  Following the Reiki level 1 Attunement, I felt a mild yet powerful energy as I was channeling (or giving) Reiki to my wife while she was in labor just a few days later. She tells me that her pain was greatly diminished and she did have the baby quite easily for a very petite woman. Unbelievable!  Then I ordered the Reiki level 2 and Reiki Master Attunements just days after that and have been channeling Reiki to my wife, newborn girl and myself.  I recommend ALL of Steve Murray's DVDs, which have changed my life - literally improving my quality of life, as well as that of my family and friends!  Steve's Reiki Healing Attunement and Reiki Psychic Attunement DVDs are priceless.  The incredible insight that you gain form the Psychic Attunement is phenomenal.  And with the Healing Attunement, after a brief yet well-spoken explanation and a few simple to follow instructions, anyone can receive Steve's Reiki healing energy right now!  Enough cannot be said about Steve Murray's amazing Attunements.",1149984000,6,1150,4.866666666666666
1410806,5,B00005A1S1,"I have been trying and trying to find a Reiki Master to learn from for a little over 2 years (ever since I received my first session from a dear friend of mine). The prices were outrageous ($250 for first and second level, and $10,000 for Master level), and I read on many sites that the ""energy exchange"" of this much money was to be sure that the student was *sincere*. I am very sincere about my desire to learn and share reiki, but do not have that kind of money to *prove* my sincerity. I became disheartened by all of that, and had almost given up on ever being able to learn, because the cost was way out of my reach. Then I found Steve Murray's books and DVD's. I received Steve Murray's Reiki 1, 2 and Master level DVD's and his 1st, 2nd and 3rd books as a gift from my dad who knew how very badly I wanted to learn Reiki, and am now attuned up to the 2nd level (and will study at this level for some time before taking the Master Level attunement). A short time ago, my dad was hospitalized for a subdural hematoma. I channeled reiki to him in the OR, and he says that he thinks he became more alert sooner after surgery in part due to my channeling the reiki energy to him. Even his ICU nurse was surprised that he wasn't more sleepy. I give alot of credit to the medical attention he received during his hospital stay, and I can't thank Steve enough for making his program affordable so I could do this for my dad, and for realizing that there are many sincere people who desire to learn for genuine and very personal reasons, whether or not they have that amount of money to prove it. I highly recommend Steve's books and dvd's. His books are very easy to read and hard to put down, and will be great to refer back to. The dvd's are very meditative and powerful too, and I will be using them for re-attunements as needed. Thank you again for everything, Steve! Keep up the great work you are doing!",1146268800,13,1911,4.209809264305177

The illustrations and instructions are excellent.  I have experienced all three Reiki Attunements on DVD, Reiki First Level Attunement, Reiki Second Level Attunement as well as the Reiki Master Attunement and I found that the enhancements each Attunement brought to my practice of Reiki to be amazing.

1410810,5,B00005A1S1,"I bought all three attunements, emotional and physical healing attunement and the psychic attunement videos.  I have to admit that I had to take reiki level 1 and 2 attunement twice before I felt like when I used it it would work.  To me it was well worth the money.

My best friend lives very far away from me.  Yesterday when we were talking she told me that she had a really bad headache, she had been dealing with it all day.  So I asked her if I could send her reiki healing for her headache and she said yes.  I told her to call me back in 30 mins.  After I got off the phone with her I wrote down all the required symbols along with her name on a card, traced the symbols with my finger 3 times closed my eyes and held her and her problem in my mind and imagined the headache going away(I did feel a small amount of heat in my hands at that time).  She called me back in the 30 mins that I asked her to and she told me that her headache was gone and she now felt tired and could go to sleep.  She thought this was so interesting that she told her friends about it.

I believe the more I use reiki the better I will be at channeling it.  Some of the reviews that I have read about these videos not working brought this thought to my mind.  It didn't work for those people because they were closed to the energy being sent to them.  As Steve explains you must say to yourself I am ready to receive the energy being sent and you may have to take the attunement a couple of different times to feel comfortable using it.  With all things for some people channeling reiki will happen with ease and for others it may take some practice.

I also read some reviews about the psychic attunement not working. Well after reading the Master Reiki book it says that the psychic attunement will not usually bring out anything that you don't already know that you have.  I took the physic attunement, I know that I am intuitive and though I haven't felt any real change yet, I feel like in time this attunement will help me. I will take it again in about 4 weeks. I also work with my Aura which I feel has helped me with my intuition and other aspects of my life with a book called ""Change Your Aura, Change Your Life.""

My last review statement is on the emotional and physical healing attunement.  I took this attunement because I had problems completely letting go of my last relationship. Before this attunement, I didn't feel like I would ever be able to move on from this person but since then I feel like a healing has indeed occured.  I know as I take this attunement for the various issues that need to be healed in my life that the next relationship I get into, I will go into it as whole ,spiritually healthy person.",1138147200,13,2718,4.172413793103448

It does NOT provide a thorough explanation of Reiki or show how to do it.  For that, you would need to purchase a separate book.  Steve Murray's hand gestures while speaking in the introduction are awkward and distracting, making me want to just get that part over with.  The attunement from Sedona was beautiful, but I wonder how an energy attunement can be transmitted via looking at a TV screen. I guess this was cheaper than paying for an attunement, but I still feel like I need a class or other guidance before I will feel comfortable trying Reiki. After watching the video, I was left with more questions and doubts than confidence in this system.",1137196800,11,771,4.731343283582089

1410813,5,B00005A1S1,"A couple of months ago, I received a Reiki session.  After the session, I had this thirst for knowledge on Reiki.  I started out by buying Steve Murray's Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki Healer DVD (2001) and Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know. It gave me some basic information so I was able to understand what was happening during my session and why.  I was totally absorbed in the Reiki process.  After the Level 1 Attunement, I started giving my daughter and a friend Reiki healing sessions.  I was amazed at the energy that flowed from my hands. His book was easy to read and understand.  He listed each step to follow during the session.  I have been able to study the book again and again.  Each time, I gained more information.  The more I gained, the more I wanted to learn more.  So I then purchased Reiki 2nd Level Attunement Learn and Use the Reiki Sacred Symbols DVD, Reiki The Ultimate Guide, Vol. 2 Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels and Reiki Psychic Music Attunement CD Volume I and 2 ~ (Audio CD) Reiki Healing Music Attunement Volume 1 and 2 ~ (Audio CD)  Again, I felt drawn to continue to learn.  I continued the healing sessions with my daughter and have now included 3 other family members.  Each session has given the receiver different a different response.  They love to receive my Reiki healing and I feel happiness in knowing that I am helping them. I really enjoy listening to his Music Attunement Volume 1. My family love listening to the music because it relaxes them.

Recently I received Reiki Master Attunement. I am anxious to experience this Attunement but I will do it when I feel I am ready.

All his program and powerful attunements has enabled me to complete Reiki training at my own comfort level.  Using his programs has allowed me to experience the gift of Reiki in my life and to share this gift with others.  Reiki has given me more focus, balance, and energy.  I feel a great sense of peace within me. I would recommend his DVDs and books to anyone interested in experiencing a healthier, more peaceful life.

I sense the ""energy"" all about me which has always been there, and have finally become Aware, something I have been striving for as a seeker for many years.  In my journey, I've studied meditation, buddhism, yoga, tai chi, pilates, hypnosis--all the while being a lover and follower of Jesus.

It gives me a feeling of competence, peace and a way to share love and compassion with others through my hands.

Steve made the unprecedented decision to offer attunements to the world, either via his DVD's or by phone. This decision has meant many people like myself, a single parent with a small bank balance also have the ability to learn and give Reiki. It has been suggested by some Reiki Masters, that those not attuned in person, are in fact not attuned at all. Well I beg to differ.

My sister gave birth to twins, Tyler and Ethan in August 2003. They were born premature, and while in special care contracted the deadly MRSA virus. Their two week old veins were pumped with every antibiotic, and their recovery hung in the balance, however eventually they both pulled through.

This poor start to life has meant they are susceptible to any viral infections going around, and when one gets ill the other one soon gets it too. Tyler was very ill with a chronic chest infection, it was 3 days before his temperature finally dropped to normal on the Friday. The Saturday I took my Level 2 attunement, which enables you to send distance healing. My sister called me on the Monday to say that Ethan was very poorly with a high fever. That night I sat quietly after my meditation, and sent Reiki to Ethan. I visualised Gods loving light entering and surrounding his little body. The following morning I called my sister to find out how Ethan was, she told me when he woke that morning his fever had gone, he was alert, and was taking fluids and had breakfast. That is the power of Reiki, and the gift that Steve Murray has given me and my family by his selfless generosity in giving Reiki attunements to everyone.

1410832,5,B00005A1S1,"After reading ""Reiki: The Ultimate Guide"" by Steve Murray, I purchased the Reiki Attunement DVDs by the author for Levels 1, 2, & 3 as a set.  I had never received a Reiki attunement before, & have taken the 1st & 2nd Attunements thus far.  And I'm happy to report that the power is on, & the Reiki is flowing.

I wanted to share with people that even if they don't experience spectacular metaphysical phenomena during the Attunements (ie. visions, colors, sensations, sounds, guides, etc)--they will still become attuned to Reiki, & when they attempt to channel it, they will still achieve results.  The ""light show"" I witnessed didn't occur during the Attunement itself, but rather afterwards--when I practiced beaming Reiki to my cat in a dark room.  The aura field around my hands became unusually bright, wider, & full of dense rays, arcs, sparks, & colored flashes.  If you can perceive auras...wait until you see what happens when you send Reiki.

Neither Attunement was taken for the first time under optimal conditions...but they were still received regardless.  Both times I thought I would need to take the Attunements again later, & yet I still obtained measured results after the first pass each time.  When I tried out the self-healing hand positions at the end of the Level 1 presentation, outwardly I felt fine, but I could feel specific areas ""pulling"" a lot more energy than others--& sure enough, 2 days later I came down with something, & the areas it manifested were the same ones I noticed drew the most energy (my sinuses, left ear, & stomach...& same with my cat's abdominal region).  Reiki is drawn to the places where it is needed most, & both kitty & ended up seeing doctors for issues in the problem areas I detected during those very first healing sessions before the week was out...  Suggesting to me that Reiki can be a superior tool not only for use in healing disease, but also for preventative health care.  I am impressed, to say the least.

What is unique about the DVD Attunements is that they can be played over & over indefinitely--providing you with your own portable Reiki Master & enabling you to reinforce & strengthen your Attunements any time you like.  Every time I retake an Attunement, the sensitivity of my perception increases & the strength of the flow of Reiki becomes more intense. I plan to get the Reiki Psychic Attunement DVD in hopes of taking my abilities as a reader to a new level, & look forward to Volume 2 of Murray's Reiki Guide.

In the negative reviews, it seems as though people either went into things with preconceived notions of what a Reiki Attunement was supposed to be which weren't actualized in their minds in some way, & so they closed themselves off to the process.  Or started off somewhat skeptical about the Attunement process in general, & as a result, they just don't seem to ""get it"" about Reiki.  I'm a pragmatic, results-oriented person, & not much of one to fixate on a lot of extranneous whistles & bells...and the bottom line is, these Attunements do work--& they will get the job done of getting a new initiate up & running with Reiki.  And to me, that's what matters.  I am able to apply & make use of what I was given with increasing skill, & I've got what I paid for.

I appreciate for the author's courage & determination to rise beyond critics & the ever-present veil of secrecy surrounding Reiki to put together this innovative initiation system--it is a worthy investment & a wonderful resource.  These Attunements make Reiki available & accessible to people like myself who have neither the financial resources, nor the instructors available in their area, with which to learn Reiki by any other means.

However, the dominant question in my mind when I purchased this product was whether an attunement could be performed in this manner.  How Steve Murray accomplishes that is still a mystery to me.  Whether I received an attunement is not a mystery.  I did.  For those who are considering the purchase of this video program, I would like to point out that I previously received the Level I attunement in-person with a qualified and recognized Reiki Master.  The cost was $125.00.  I had scheduled the Level II attunement with this same Master at an additional $125.00.  Due to conflicts with the Master's calendar, I was unable to proceed to Level II and began to search for alternatives.  Based on one of the other reviews here, I chose to purchase Master Murray's programs and did a ""refresher"" with his Level I prior to experiencing the Level II.  I enthusiastically endorse this method.  For those who are interested in becoming Reiki Level I practitioners, the video will provide you with excellent training and a wonderful attunement.  As a recommendation, go through the video program and attunement beginning to end.  Then, with your finger on the pause button, go through it again and take lots of notes.  Master Murray will explain everything you need to know in order to competent at Level I practice.  If your experiences are anything like mine, it will be a wonderful, expansive spiritual experience and you will come away with the ability and confidence to channel Reiki energy for the healing of self and others.",1093737600,18,1622,4.822463768115942

Now I figure I am ready to start taking Steve Murray's 1st Reiki Attunement DVD. I became one with the crystal and Earths crystal at the core. I could feel the huge crystal in the earth pop open and spin, the light energy came right on up the central vertical body current and through the top of my head past the crown several inches.  Again I start releasing junk. So I go with it embrace what's is happening and go back to my cocoon to process. This time I feel the heartache I have had just float away, and light energy filled my heart.

Steve's 2nd Reiki Attunement was very subtle, and soft. I know there were cellular changes, I didn't crave the foods I feel additive to, the desire to smoke has faded. I could also feel the crystal energy passing my Central Vertical Body current, up the feet, out the crown, then from crown back to earth.

Nothing like liquid light cleanse!

When I did the Reiki Master Attunement. I felt information coming through every cell in my body, I couldn't understand what the garble was, could feel my ears and sinuses open and receive, could see little light orbs swirling about, I felt my hands, crown and base start to get warm and by time the attunement was over I had so much heat radiating through my body, it was like seeing the heat waves coming up from a hot black pavement in the summer.

Since then I have been able to pick up on friends in need of love, kindness, sympathy and be able to call them tell and ask what is going on, how can I help, that I feel they need soothing. I have been right on every time. This happens even to people I have a casual relationship with. People I am close to, well it `s almost like telepathic energy. I don't dare let my shields down or l feel all of their pain or suffering, I let in the joy, but I won't allow myself to be a sponge.

Reiki is a beautiful gift and everyone would benefit by it.

1410836,5,B00005A1S1,"I read The Ultimate Reiki Book. Wow, I could not put it down, did not put it down until I read the whole book. It paints a clearer picture of what your are receiving. I have since read it again. I use all reinforcements available.

Now I figure I am ready to start taking Steve Murray's 1st Reiki Attunement DVD. I became one with the crystal and Earths crystal at the core. I could feel the huge crystal in the earth pop open and spin, the light energy came right on up the central vertical body current and through the top of my head past the crown several inches.  Again I start releasing junk. So I go with it embrace what's is happening and go back to my cocoon to process. This time I feel the heartache I have had just float away, and light energy filled my heart.

Steve's 2nd Reiki Attunement was very subtle, and soft. I know there were cellular changes, I didn't crave the foods I feel additive to, the desire to smoke has faded. I could also feel the crystal energy passing my Central Vertical Body current, up the feet, out the crown, then from crown back to earth.

Nothing like liquid light cleanse!

1410837,5,B00005A1S1,"I had worked previously with Steve Murray's Reiki healing video and found it to be marvelously effective with significant results in the form of relief from much of the persistant pain from my fibromyalgia. Convinced by the efficacy of Reiki from Steve's presentation and my own past experiences with in-person Reiki practitioners, I decided to purchase this DVD, as there was no one in my area who was qualified to train me in Reiki I and II.

Why does it work? Well...from a metaphysical point of view, all spaces are HERE and all time is NOW--there's no reason you and Steve can't connect in the HERE AND NOW. The crystal in the video is merely a focal point to keep the mind and attention centered...and yes, it is not uncommon to see quite a bit of phenomena on screen; for some viewers the crystal may change color, become cloudy or clearer, see moving images, etc. I know I saw it change. But that's beside the point--it's just a bridge to help you and Steve connect...and you will.

I felt a strong rush of heat during the Attunement, and at one point felt a powerful rise of emotion, rather like a barrier breaking down, causing a few tears to slip down my face, followed by a great sense of calm and resolution, as if something half healed in me was finally made whole.

And yes--after the Attunement there was no question that the Reiki energy flowed effortlessly from both hands, rather like a gentle current of strong warmth. (After my Reiki II Attunement, it it became greatly intensified once I began using the Usui Reiki symbols, more like a deep pulsing sensation that tends to linger for hours after I give Reiki).

I also recommend Steve's new book on Reiki, which will answer a lot of your questions, and Steve also recommends to continue seeking out information, resources and discovering new ways to channel this beneficial healing energy.

1410839,5,B00005A1S1,"Up until a few months ago I had no idea that I could learn Reiki because of the price many were charging. I had all but given up hope on ever affording to learn this healing modality. I had heard from friends who learned Reiki about the [$$$PRICE$$$] PRICE they payed to learn Reiki. Ouch! I basically had forgotten about wanting to learn Reiki (because of sticker shock) until I came across on Amazon.com Steve Murray's attunment videos and guide by accident. Let me tell you this mode of getting the attunments REALLY WORKS!
Another Reiki Master doubted the ability of getting the attunments via a VHS or DVD, but I was open minded because of all of the spiritual seeking and experiences I have had in my life. The Reiki Master discouraged me and like reverse psychology, I went ahead and purchased them anyway. I guess No means Yes to me.
My experience with the attunment video's were VERY POWERFUL. I felt like I was in a trance (I am sure I was) and the room became very bright white and cloudy. It felt as if an Ascended Master could have walked right in the room with me at any moment.
I could most definitely feel the energy!
By the end of the attunments it felt like I had slapped my hands together so hard and could feel the energy, tingling and heat in my hands and even in my feet. Purchasing the guide book is really something you should do if you are going to get the attunment video's or DVD's. They go hand in hand. Money well spent!
I have since been using Reiki on myself, my son and even a wild bird who flew into my sliding glass door. I have also done a session on my Mom who was sick in Brazil on a trip while I was at my home in California and also to a sick friend in Arizona.
Owning the attunment videos is so wonderful because I can reattune anytime and as often as I like.
Thanks Steve for being a Maverick and making it possible for me and others like me to afford to learn Reiki!!!

1410841,5,B00005A1S1,"Thanks to Steve Murray for making available to all who seek this, an affordable system that works. I have recieved all three levels of attunement and My life is truly changed for the better. Not to mention the great change in my massage practitioners business. I offer Reiki with the massage for a total experience. The DVDs and The Book are wonderfull. Easy to follow and read. Anyone interested in Reiki should buy these.",1084752000,4,423,4.72972972972973
1410842,5,B00005A1S1,"I have now purchased Steve Murray's... ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", ""Reiki 1st Level Attunements"", ""Reiki 2nd Level"" and ""Master Attunement"".
I was very impressed with the healing energy that comes forth through these much needed DVD'S of Reiki attunements.

However, if you are looking for information on the history of Reiki, you will not find it here. There are many wonderful books out there for that kind of knowledge, but if you are truly interested in receiving Reiki attunements then these are the DVD's I recommend.  If you are wanting attunements to be able to heal yourself, others and this beautiful world we live in, then Steve's DVD Attunements are for you.

I was blown away by the love I felt and the flow of positive energy.  The attunements are powerful!  I am so eternally thankful someone stepped outside their comfort zone and made Reiki attunements available at such an affordable price.  Reiki is needed now more than ever.  This is truly healing for the now and the future.

If you are interested in making a positive difference in yourself, and others, I urge you to get these Reiki attunements. And don't let people tell you that to be able to receive attunements you have to do it in secret, and it has to cost a lot of money.  Reiki energy is a gift from God and is a free, loving energy to anyone that has a desire for healing.

I thank Steve for having a vision for the betterment of everyone!

This will honor you where you are, and inspire you to go beyond your impossibilities!",1083110400,7,1509,4.635338345864661

1410854,5,B00005A1S1,"An anonymous review dated 17 title"" Is this a joke"" has been brought to my attention. I would like to clarify a few issues to help prevent this situation from happening again. That is, a person buying the program and not fully understanding what it is about and its content, and being unhappy.
I personally do not believe Reiki is a joke, or did I produce my programs as a joke. My five (1st, 2nd, Master, Psychic, Healing) Reiki Video and DVD programs are for passing the actual Reiki Attunement and that's the main content. All the programs have some Reiki information (what's an attunement, preparation for the attunement, why and how it works etc.) in them and this is fully described in the product detail page. And the 2nd and Master level programs show and explain the Reiki Symbols and give suggestions on using them after taking the Attunement.
If you are expecting a video or DVD that gives information on the history of Reiki, basic background on Reiki, personal stories about Reiki etc, and do not want an actual Reiki Attunement, please buy one of the many fine books on Amazon that has information you seek, not the program. Of course the books will not supply the Attunement.
I did finally publish a Reiki book for the many, many thousand of people around the world that have taken my Reiki Attunements successfully and for other individuals that seek advanced Reiki information to continue their Reiki Journey. The book is described in the product detail page and can be found on Amazon. A suggestion for some people, get the book first and then decide if you would like an Attunement from one of my programs.
Also, after the Reiki Attunement if you are expecting and/or must feel something and/ or heal instantly, again, please do not buy the program. Now, many people do have physical feelings, sensations, healing and changes immediately. And this continues to get stronger with their continued practice and use of Reiki. Healings and miracles can and do happen with Reiki quickly. But, usually Reiki is a process and sometimes you need to use it with other healing modalities for the best results. A simple example, you break a leg. The leg is set and put into a cast by a medical doctor and you use Reiki to help heal it faster.
The reviewer reported ""didn't do a thing for me"" does not really clarify if the attunement was received, but assuming the person did take the time to take the attunement, just because you do not feel a physical sensation, does not mean healing or change is not occurring after receiving the Attunement. It sometimes takes some time and more Attunements. Healing and change can be taking place on the mental, emotional and /or spiritual level and you are not consciously aware of it, and it will take a while to see and feel the change on the physical level, so please have patience.
As for the watercolor diagrams, lol art is very subjective and the artist I commissioned for the drawings I feel is talented and he gave me exactly what I was looking for. But, whatever the opinion on the watercolor illustrations, without a doubt they convey the Reiki hand positions, and that is what is important.
As always, any questions feel free to contact me

1410860,5,B00005A1S1,"I would like to give my comments about the Reiki Masters that have down played and gave these attunement programs a bad rap. Come on, these programs are not for you anyway. And if you took the time to read the many comments from the people that these attunements have helped, isn't that good?
I can't understand why these masters are concerned how a person gets Reiki (and people are from these attunements). Is it because it does not fit into their belief system? How about the belief system of the people that have received Reiki from these attunements?
It looks like to me there are politics even in healing (Reiki). If you do not take the attunements their way, it does not work or count. And even though the attunements are received (statements from people say they have), well...it's not the right way to get Reiki?. There is a bad and good Reiki?
I am sure these Reiki Masters have helped people, but,in my mind this small group of people are casting the first stone.
In my opinion all Reiki Masters do not have the same ability.  When some state a certain attunement cannot be done, they are speaking of their own ability, knowledge and training. Just like in any other profession, there are levels of talent and ability.
Example: one medical doctor will say a medical procedure or treatment is impossible to perform or will not work because of his skills, ability and teachings. Another doctor will say it will not be a problem because of his skills, ability, talent and teachings, and he will be successful.
I recommend all the attunements, but if you are a Reiki Master,  I would pass because you have the attunements and symbols.

1410861,5,B00005A1S1,"Hello, first of all I would like to say I have a great many of Steve Murray's programs and I find them all great and I have felt and received all the attunements. His programs do what they say they will do. They are truely remarkable.
Now, It seems that his Reiki Attunement Programs have created a lot of controversy in the Reiki community. I understand that you cannot please all the people all the time. All great people(including healers)and their work has met opposition from different people and organizations throughout history.
This is especially true when people are ahead of their time or start something new and maybe go against the system. Steve Murray fits into that category
I have read the few letters that disagree with his programs and
all of them were from Reiki Masters. When I read the letters I cannot help but feel the resentment in what they write and maybe some anger. And I believe their criticism is self serving (I will explain latter in fees). I am also curious what do they say to the thousands of people who have received the attunements from Steve Murray (read a few of their letters) that they are mistaken or lying?
...
be happy with these programs.
On the other hand I have spoken to some enlighten Reiki Masters who are happy with the programs and do not feel threaten by them.
And it is my belief that these programs are not for Reiki Masters, they are for people like myself who want self healing.
It is Karma that the few Reiki Masters that are trying to discourage these Reiki Programs from being used, are actually helping getting these programs to more people. So Controversy is good, everything happens for a reason. These programs seem to be always number one in Reiki sales.
I do not care how you get your Reiki Attunements, but please get them. These programs can be an option, but do what you feel is right.

Video's have changed my life.
I first purchased Reiki Level One Attunement And the Reiki Psychic Attunement Video from Steve almost two years ago.
After the third time I watched Steve's tapes I was on the internet chat room known as yahoo and a young woman that was very distressed over the death of her friend and her mother who died over a year ago was in the chatroom.
I felt so sorry for her and wished with all my heart that I could help her.
Suddenly these names and faces came to me and started communicating to me for her.
I knew her mom and friends name ,how they passed and their was a very long conversation. The young lady was so happy and relieved to here from them and that was the day I began my work as a psychic medium.
Since then I have bought every tape of Steve's I could get my hands on.
