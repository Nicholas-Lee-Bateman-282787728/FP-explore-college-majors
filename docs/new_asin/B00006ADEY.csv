1735672,5,B00006ADEY,"Fun sexploitation! USCHI DIGARD looks like the 50 foot woman in this film. She is the 'LOST SOUL' of the film. Dancing and bouncing though out the desert in nothing but thigh high patine leather booths and a chain around her waste. She interprets the convoluted plot about a corrupt sheriff who smuggles pot through the Mexican boarder into the USA. This film has three introductions. The first is a script about freedom of choice and speech that scrolls over a lightening fast montage of Uschi bouncing around. The montage is so kinetic that the words of freedom of choice become obsolete... Intro number two is a bold narration about the evils of marijuana corrupting the minds of today's (1969) thrill seeking, turned on-generation. It seems to contradict the the previous introduction... very tongue in cheek. The third intro is the film's opening credits... RUSS MEYER'S CHERRY & HARRY & RAQUEL. A blonde woman and a young man are seen driving in the desert. They stop the car and begin fornicating next to the sand and brush and cacti while the psychedelic song, ""Toys of Our Time,"" blasts on the soundtrack. The film ends with the narrator giving the audience a moral road map of the characters. SPOLILER: The VERY end of the film reveals that the whole plot has been the novel or story of a female author. She types away on her typewriter and her husband asks her brother if he has ever read his sister's, ""anti-social,"" writing. The film alludes that the said author is carrying on an incestuous relationship with her brother. Perverted and brilliant.",1396051200,,1560,4.802973977695167

I love Napier (this is why I got it - I'm not really that well versed in the Russ Meyer lore) I love busty babes, and I love Vic Perrin.  What's not to like?!",1373155200,,329,4.046153846153846
1735674,5,B00006ADEY,"This is from Russ Meyers, whose movies were released in the 1980's under the label of the bosomania collection. All of his movies feature actress with enormous boobs, and this one is no exception. I found the movie to be funny in an over the top kind of way. I purposefully had watched the movie, because I had read that character actor, Charles Napier, had appeared totally naked. It's true. He and a woman are totally naked as they run towards the camera. ""Little Harry"" and his boys are fully displayed. Charles was a hunky guy. This really took balls for an actor in the 1960's t0 have done this level of nudity.",1359072000,,616,4.460176991150442
1735675,2,B00006ADEY,"For the life of me I still don't know what to think of Russ Meyer's Cherry, Harry & Raquel. It is either of of the worst films ever made or it's a surrealist masterpiece of the highest order. The truth lies somewhere between one of those poles. There is a great anecdote that Meyer's star Linda Ashton walked off the set leaving big holes in the plot that had to be filled with inserts of a beautiful nude Uschi Digard that explains the film's unfinished look.

What plot there is concerns the evils of drug smuggling. The film begins with a monotone narration about the developing evil of marijuana in modern society and the need for vigilance in stopping the actions of the ""pushers"" and the ""smugglers.""

Harry (Charles Napier), a small town border sheriff, lives at the site of a defunct silver mine with his girlfriend Cherry, an Englishwoman who works as a nurse. The blonde Raquel (Larissa Ely) is a writer and works to sexually pleasure the local men for the enjoyment of it. Cherry and Raquel are intrigued with meeting each other, but Harry prevents this meeting as he feels that the idea of two women having sex with each other is ""un-American.""

Harry and his Mexican-American associate Enrique, work for local politician Mr. Franklin (Frank Bolger) in an operation in which they divert marijuana through the border. Mr. Franklin informs Harry that their associate ""Apache"" has gone into business for himself and must be eliminated (killed). Harry summons Enrique (who is in bed with Raquel) and they go to the desert to look for Apache in order to carry out their plan. They fail and Apache gets away and manages to steal Harry's jeep.

Frustrated with repeated failures to kill Apache, Mr. Franklin calls Harry to tell him he is taking too long and that now Enrique also needs to be killed because he knows too much. They set Enrique up to deliver drugs to the mine where Harry will kill him. En route to the mine, however, Enrique is killed in the desert by Apache who brutally runs him down with Harry's jeep. When Raquel arrives at the hospital where Mr. Franklin is staying to sexually service him, she finds he also has been murdered by Apache.

Raquel is in the hospital recovering from the shock of finding Mr. Franklin dead. Her assigned care nurse turns out to be Cherry. When Cherry enters her room for nursing duties, Raquel produces a small case containing marijuana cigarettes. They share a couple of joints, then dance naked together and have a sexual experience.

Meanwhile, Harry, is alone at the mine, still waiting for Enrique. Geronimo shows up instead, driving up in Harry's jeep and taunting him with the horn. Harry comes out shooting and they trade multiple gunshots. Finally, after each having been shot several times, Harry drops dead and Geronimo falls dead on top of him while Cherry and Raquel continue to have lesbian sex with each other in the hospital

Through all this there are the images of Soul (Digard) that keep popping up and an ending narration that reminds us how important the concept of soul is in our lives.

This is not a great Meyer film but it is cerainly unusual and well worth a look.",1336694400,,3146,4.67631103074141
1735676,3,B00006ADEY,"I gave it 3 stars for all the sexy brief nudity but it was too edited on the sex scenes,was lead to believe that it was more graphic of the Russ Meyer films,I liked the women but it was not as good as advertised,too candid on the hot scenes.too cut!",1310947200,,249,4.0
1735677,3,B00006ADEY,"The story takes place in the Nevada desert... Frank Bolger is a conspicuous man in the community who also happens to run a drug-smuggling ring on the side... The local sheriff is in on it, acting as his hit man.

After a hot scene with one of the local women, Bolger orders the sheriff to eliminate the Apache (John Milo), an Indian who has been cutting into their marijuana sales... The sheriff reluctantly agrees, takes the boss's woman home, and relieves his frustrations on her before trying to carry the Indian away...

Meyer does indeed have a fascination for very richly gifted women, and this film is no exception... The scene where Bolger talks the nurse into giving him a body massage is a classic erotic tease... Also, Meyer has very cleverly juxtaposed a sensual lesbian scene against a bloody battle between the sheriff and the Indian... But much of the sex is unmotivated... Meyer cuts so quickly, however, that it is more of a lack of respect tease than an exploitive treatment of sex...

Larissa Ely (Raquel) is wonderful as the steamy, sweaty, desert young woman... Linda Ashton (Cherry) is delightful as the sexy nurse, but Charles Napier steals the show as the violent, explosive, cruel of a sheriff...",1232236800,,1221,4.804761904761905
1735678,5,B00006ADEY,"The best thing about Russ Meyer's movies is the [...]  He always chooses women with big sexy buxoms.  And what I like the most in this movie is the positions of sex, for me always prefer the classic passion (woman in the bottom) which you will see a lot in this film",1153267200,,266,4.096153846153846
1735679,3,B00006ADEY,"This Russ Meyer classic opens with a disclaimer heralding the importance of free speech- a movie that David Lame and cobbers will abhore. Which is GOOD for us ""jackbooted liberals"" ""lacking in moralistic backbone"". (YOU'RE reading this, so you must be. Right? ha ha ha)
As expected, Russ has filled every possible frame with shots of tight female buns and big bouncy jubblies. One wouldn't expect any less from the ""titular"" Grandmaster of sexploitation.
CHERRY, HARRY AND RAQUEL's threadbare plot is supposed to center around marijuana smuggling in a small town in the Arizona desert. It's good to see Meyer is clearly anti-drug, which will annoy my other fave people, The NZ Green Party.
Scripted by Meyer and author Tom ""Bonfire Of The Vanities"" Wolfe from Meyer's story, the movie stars Charles Napier ( later better known as Murdock from RAMBO 2) as Harry, Larissa Ely as Raquel and Linda Ashton as Cherry the nurse; who early on gives a dirty old man a bed bath. Lucky Gramps. As you'd guess from the title, this is a love triangle with lots of hetero and lesbian sex scenes. Meyer also tosses in a scattering of gore; though personally what I found most disturbing was the brief full-frontal of Napier running along a beach with his wobbly bits bouncing left, right and centre. Crikey Russ, people don't pay to see your movies to be subjected to gratuitious salami shots!
That's my sole complaint, but that will give women a reason for watching this. Anything to help spread the disease,so to speak (How un P.C of me). As with his earlier movie BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS Meyer concludes the film with a philosophical, moralistic narrative, which is more sensible than anything the SPCS can attempt to force down the NZ public's throats (This movie was made in 1969. Just goes to show how out of date NZ is). But don't worry guys, Russ has generously insterspersed his moral reasoning with a montage of T&A shots from the movie, just to help jog your memory. This is the most fun you can pack into 70 minutes. Eat your black heart out, David Lame.",1055462400,13,2058,4.703601108033241

At $40 it is just not worth it. If you can find it for less than $30 then go for it. Its too bad because the film is a riot and deserves a better transfer. Rmfilms emailed me that the transfer process is too costly.,1433721600,,370,4.013513513513513
7966016,3,B00006ADEY,"And much much cardin and mammary gland

Such is the absurdity of this movie you can even get to enjoy ... It seems that the most important for the director is to show naked women showing their huge breasts. Appear at all times and that's the best , in the middle of any sequence, appear flat several seconds of naked women running around the desert, posing among rocks, in a pool, on a bed , sucking her thumb ...
So I thought of putting to 6 - Interesting, because the film is very interesting and has its analysis.
Russ Meyer devoted his whole career to shoot this kind of film and I must say in his favor that has been a great reference to John Waters and Quentin Tanrantino .",1433203200,,679,4.223076923076923
