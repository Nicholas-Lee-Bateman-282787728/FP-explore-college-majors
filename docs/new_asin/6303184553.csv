8187257,3,6303184553,"To be clear: I love Ranma 1/2. This final set contains some great episodes, though no real resolution as the anime had caught up to the manga. The reason I am giving the set three stars rather than five is simply because of the subtitles. The subs on this set, and indeed most Viz blu-ray sets, are small and white. They are difficult to read at times, even on large televisions. The eye strain gets very unpleasant very quickly. I really wish Viz would do something about that.",1468886400,,478,4.443181818181818
