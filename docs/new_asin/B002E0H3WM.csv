8366617,5,B002E0H3WM,I bought to this DVD disc for my ten year old grandson and he was estatic about it.  He loved it and was glad I got it for him.,1358294400,,127,3.3793103448275863
8366618,1,B002E0H3WM,"This product makes me regret buying DVD's online.
Video quality = bad, 4:3 SD caption of the games and trainings. The commentator on the DVD has an awful English accent. The structure of the material is boring and repeated, You will see a short summary of what the team have done (training/game) with a hard voice-over of the annoying English commentator. This is not an official FC Barcelona product, it's an amateur release of Barcelona's games.
If you are an FC Barcelona fan, I recommend you buying FC Barcelona Champions Of Europe 2006 2-Disc DVD and FC Barcelona-Mas Que un Club, both have a professional quality of video and sound.

I wished I could rate this product 0 star, but it gets 1 for capturing goals and games (in the worst quality).",1257033600,3,750,4.681818181818182
8366619,2,B002E0H3WM,"When my daughter accidently deleted the HD version of the Champions League game from by DVR, I was hopeful this DVD would be a replacement, especially since the final game is presented in its entirety.  Unfortunately, the great Barcelona victory is ruined by poor quality.  It's almost like someone slapped these games together and burned them to a DVD at home. I'm surprised such a well run organization would authorize such a low quality product.",1255478400,5,448,4.96
