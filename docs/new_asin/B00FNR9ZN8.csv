6016116,5,B00FNR9ZN8,"My local NBC station in San Francisco carried this series on an irregular basis...pre-empting the series for most of its one season run for either local programming or NBC's West Coast sports coverage.  The series followed the Super Friends formula with short 10 minute adventures per segment, a team-up episode,  and a melodramatic narrator describing the action.  It was great to hear the great original voices of Gary Owens, Don Messick, Mike Road, and Virginia Gregg reprising their 60s roles.  The unseen ""Space Stars"" science, secret codes, and magic segments and the music segments with the laser light animation effects were an excellent bonus addition.  Great Hanna-Barbera nostalgia!",1386115200,11,693,5.37962962962963
6016117,5,B00FNR9ZN8,"I did not watch this cartoon as a child but I did catch it on the USA Network Cartoon Express cartoon block when I was a teenager.  I enjoyed the cartoon back then but was wondering if it was ever going to be released on DVD.  I didn't see the show as it was shown on TV in the early 80's.  Watching it now it reminds me of The All-New Super Friends Hour shows with the learning and magic skits.  It kind of just copies the whole format of The All-New Super Friends Hour.  It's not a bad thing since Super Friends was so successful over the years.  If you are into cartoons you would notice that cartoons do this stuff all the time.  When one cartoon becomes successful there are new cartoons that follow the same format to capitalize on the success.  60's cartoons have the same feel to them.  70's cartoons have the same feel to them.  80's cartoons have the same feel to them.....etc.  I enjoyed watching these toons again.  Space Ghost has a cooler space ship than the 60's version.  The Teen Force cartoons are exciting with their nemesis Uglor.  The Herculoids is great but I can't stop feeling that they borrowed story lines from the 60's cartoon.  I'll have to check that out.  Astro and the Space Mutts is pretty much a tongue and cheek comedy cartoon with Space Ace who looks completely like Burt Reynolds.  I know that was the point and it brings me back to when Burt Reynolds was a mega star.  All in all the cartoon is very kid friendly and a good cartoon to add to your 80's toon collection.  I've waited a long time for this toon.  It shocked me that they put this out being that it is kind of obscure in the cartoon world.  Now can we have the whole GOBOT series, Warner Archive?  That cartoon was a staple in my childhood.  GOBOT fans are waiting.",1385337600,6,1764,4.2948328267477205
6016118,5,B00FNR9ZN8,"""Space Stars"" was one of many series in its respective era created to capitalize on the success of ""Star Wars"" (for the most part 1978-1982) and was originally intended to air in the 1980-1981 NBC Saturday Morning season.  In a sense, it was an anthology that revived two (well, three in a sense) 1960s Hanna-Barbera properties in the form of ""Space Ghost"" and ""The Herculoids"".  It also added new segments, such as ""Teen Force"" (three teenaged heroes that echoed memories of ""The Galaxy Trio"", another H-B 60s cartoon) and ""Astro and the Space Mutts"" (pairing the Jetsons' pet dog in a group led by Space Ace as a light-hearted counter-balance to the other action/dramatic themes of the block of shows).  A television strike in mid-1980 derailed this program from airing that fall.  Despite that setback, the series eventually did air the following season on NBC (1981-1982).  Because the series ended production before NBC aired a single episode, all the viewers had to watch were the 11 hour-long episodes already produced (six segments aired in each hour-long show; two ""Space Ghost"", a single ""Herculoids"", ""Teen Force"" and ""Astro"" segment as well as a team-up segment titled ""Space Stars Finale"").

I enjoyed the series as a kid; It aired after ""Kids Super Power Hour With Shazam"" and before ""Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends"".  I never envisioned that the series would be deemed classic enough to be released on DVD, but thanks to Warner Archive Collection, it's now available for all to own and enjoy.

In my opinion, the show has aged well.  There are obvious things that show the series' age but certainly nothing to keep one from viewing it with their children or grandchildren.  With the segments ranging in 7-8 minutes a pop, the varying plot devices and other dramas resolve themselves very quickly and each episode/segment never feels like it's too long.

One thing that really seemed to help set it apart from any sort of contemporaries was the sense of a joined universe.  You could expect the Teen Force to aid Space Ghost against a menace of the week or even against their Darth Vader/Dr. Doom-styled main enemy Uglor and vice versa.  It wasn't odd for Space Ghost to aid the Herculoids against a threat endangering the planet Quasar.  There were even occasions that Space Ace, Astro and the Space Mutts aided others in saving the day... and those weren't necessarily segments of the Space Stars Finale.  Later animated shows such as ""Batman: The Animated Series"", ""Superman: The Animated Series"" and ""Justice League"" established a shared universe and continuity, but for me I first saw such a concept with ""Space Stars"".

The Remastering done on this program is remarkable.  These episodes look about as good as they did when they first aired back in 1981.  As with anything, some episodes do look much better than others due to the fact that when the show ended its run on NBC, various segments were split up for airing in rerun packages on cable stations.  Some segments haven't been seen since the early 1980s (Teen Force being a prime example), and while most Teen Force segments look great, there's an element of grain in an episode or two.  The same can be said really for each segment, but overall it is impressive.  The colors are vibrant; you won't have to mess with your tv to see the colors as they were meant to be seen thanks to the remastering.  The sound is clear, not anywhere close to being muddled and it's never too loud or too quiet.

A real treasure is the fact that until recently, no one knew there were additional segments that were intended to be a part of ""Space Stars"".  They were filler much like what aired in the ""All-New Super Friends Hour"" sure, but for those of us that never knew they existed, it's cool to see them included in this collection.  Things like ""Space Magic"" (easy-to-do magic at home with parents or siblings), ""Space Fact"" (which enlighten young viewers about the cosmos and certain things within it, one subject at a time), ""Space Mystery"" (essentially mini-episodes where a hero would solve a mystery using the very same 'Space Fact' of the episode), an unnamed strange segment utilizing what was cutting-edge graphics and lasers and adding in ships chasing ships or ships chasing monsters (an oddity for sure; still as a curiosity, it's cool to view that at least once), and ""Space Code"" (where a hero gets some sort of tip and needs the viewers to help decipher the code and adds corresponding instructions to do so; these were broken up into three individual mini-segments aired in the second half of the hour).  Another excellent treasure is that the show's teaser that told viewers what they would be seeing in that week's first three segments are included and air before the opening credits; it helps take you back to an era where that was routine and built anticipation for the week's episodes.  There's even a second teaser at roughly the half-hour mark of each episode which does the same for the final three segments of the episode.

According to this Warner Archive podcast ([...] two of the show's segments were missing and had to be located.  One was found with no problems but the other was suffering from 'Vinegar Syndrome' which in short terms is irreversible and eventual death for film elements ([...]  Luckily Warner Archive managed to find a way to record it onto equipment designed for preserving film.  The efforts expended to bring such a series to home audiences is second to none and they can't be commended enough for saving this segment (and in essence, the entire series as a whole).

I really can't say enough good things about the show.  Some may criticize the show and compare it to the 1960s ""Space Ghost"" and ""Herculoids"" but those that worked on ""Space Stars"" gave all they could and it was an impression that some of us still remember.  Thanks to the tireless work of Warner Archive, ""Space Stars"" will always be remembered.",1381881600,45,5932,4.80039331366765

6016166,5,B00FNR9ZN8,"Although I didn't watch this series when it was on NBC, I watched it's competition, Blackstar at the time on CBS. Goldie Gold and Action Jack was on at the same time, but moved to an earlier time during midseason. Both shows are great. Back to the review:

I thought of this show as having poor animation and bad writing for years. Actually, it's not so bad. Keep in mind that this was the early 80's where Hanna Barbera was on auto pilot making shows without consideration of quality as many would complain about today. Yes, you can see some of the dirt, yellowing, and specks in these episodes. However I don't mind since I grew up from this era of animation.

32 years later, you are now able to own the complete 11 eps of this series. I think Hanna-Barbera wanted to recapture this series as an 80's version of The All New Superfriends Hour. Why, you ask? It was not only the cross overs of the shows groups showing up in other episodes, but in the educational content that was supposed to be included in the series. There were: Space Magic, Space Fact, Space Mystery, Space chase music sequence, and Space Code. Some of the Space Magic segments were similar to the '77 season of the Superfriends. There's even some underscores heard here familiar to you from The Superfriends, (for Astro and The Space Mutts) Scooby and Scrappy Doo, Richie Rich, and The Fonz and The Happy Days Gang(?) I don't know why NBC rejected the educational segments. Consider them as your DVD extras from this Warner Archive release. Another bonus here is you'll hear Casey Kasem's ""We Now Return To Our Program"" on the show's sub main titles when he did the bumpers for NBC Saturday Mornings for that season (He did them from 1979-87). It's only heard on Teen Force, Herculoids, Space Ghost (2nd episode), and Space Star Finale. This is the line-up of each episode on the dvd:

Space Ghost (Episode 1)
Space Magic

Space Stars End Credits

How sad that Boomerang couldn't air the entire series in it's hour long format, and how sad that this series was split up into different segments over the years.

While this show was made in 1980, the show's end credits is copyrighted 1981, and contains the 1979 version of the HB swirling star. If you watch episode 4 of Space Stars, you'll see in the Space Chase music sequence that segment was used for the show's end credits on the DVD set. All I can say is enjoy this trip back into 1981, or should I say 1980!",1388793600,21,2751,4.527162977867203
6016167,4,B00FNR9ZN8,"Space Stars and a Flintstones offering (Flintstones Comedy Hour or something) were the two biggest casualties of the early eighties cartoon strike. Neither aired until about a year or so later, and any appeal or possibilities of any effectiveness was gone. I do recall instead there were reruns of Dynomutt, Godzilla, Daffy Duck, the Jetsons instead.
So I finally got to see these shows, removed of commercials and they were fun, adventurous, not overly interesting or intelligent. Attempts at making kids think with little games (which I also recall on the Flintstones program) fall kind of flat.
Granted, I was older, but have always enjoyed cartoons.
What this show has working best for it is the characters criss-crossing and meeting up; old (Space Ghost, Herculoids) with the new (Teen Force, Space Dogs), but there really weren't overwhelmingly impressive encounters there either.

About the most telling difference here (aside from Gleep's different noise) was the decision that the Herculoids must be a family, something that was never really carried over in the original cartoon.
And maybe there shouldn't have been a recurring bad guy in that Uglor fella. He really wasn't needed.

Still, a fun eighties cartoon.",1387843200,,1222,5.229591836734694
