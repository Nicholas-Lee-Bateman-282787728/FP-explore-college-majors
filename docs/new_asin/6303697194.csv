720551,3,6303697194,"Aces: Iron Eagle III is where the series starts to turn the corner and even the ""movie believable"" becomes unbelievable. This is certainly an attempt to cash in on the original and surprisingly good initial sequel. In III good ole Chappy is now battling druggies in Peru lead by a former Nazi criminal. See? That's a stretch and a half.

The only reason I give it 3* review is because Gossett still does his job well and I love aircraft. THEY are the real stars. Well, Gossett is too. And so is Sonny Chiba.",1468540800,,507,4.3936170212765955

720711,4,6303697194,"Iron Eagle 3 Aces,  stars Louis Gossett Jr. as Air force reserve Col. Charles ""Chappy"" Sinclair flying geniune WW2 planes in a air show, learns of the death of a friend, a pilot, whose plane wreckage is shown to have drugs. While visiting his late friends home comes by his sister Anna, played by Rachel Mclish, returning home after escaping from captors holding her Peruvian village, Sinclair finds out drugs are being smuggled out of the air base that are tied to some personnel that includes the general(played Mitchell Ryan). Chappy must then lead his fellow aces to go into combat flying WW2 warbirds that include the P 38 lightning, Spitefire Mk. IX, Zero A6M, and Messersmitt 109 G (actually a Mustang D painted over) to liberate Anna's village from evil drug lords. The aerial shots of the classic planes make for exciting action, and a thrilling conclusion.",1392854400,,866,4.851351351351352
720712,5,6303697194,"The use of vintage aircraft, even those that are made to look like the Jap A6M Zero (T-6) and the Me 109 (P51B), still is awesome to watch. Having flown in the past, I know that the older prop fighters can turn inside a jet fight. It is also harder to hit, when  you factor in the difference  air speeds. Great cast also helps make this a awesome movie. G.Goff",1391990400,,360,4.128571428571429
720713,5,6303697194,Iron Eagle three is based on when USA and the Soviet Union were at odds with each other during the cold war. This is a great movie for the whole family and shows even when u r at odds with someone you can still be on the same team to stop terrorist bent on destruction of life as we know it.,1377561600,,291,3.7868852459016393

720727,3,6303697194,"I am writing this review to warn potential buyers of ""Iron Eagle III: Aces"" as many secondary sellers here are 'mistaking' releases. New Line Cinema released a version here in the United States that is anamorphic widescreen (16x9) with DTS surround sound. Alliance Atlantis released their own full screen version in Canada with mono sound.

Since the New Line Widescreen version is out-of-print it can only be obtained through secondary sellers here on amazon. The problem is many sellers are listing the Full Screen Canadian release (that has a different bar code/ISBN number mind you) here on the New Line page instead of the proper Alliance Atlantis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aces-Iron-Eagle-3-Ff/dp/B0001OKTGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aces:Iron Eagle 3 (Ff)</a>&nbsp;page.

I originally bought ""Iron Eagle III: Aces"" here from a secondary seller and was disappointed to receive the Canadian version that sadly only has a Full Screen transfer (though it does have a nice reversible cover with the title in French). I have no problem with Canadian DVDs as they are playable here in the United States (both are Region 1/NTSC) but I was upset the seller 'mistakenly' listed the wrong release when I was expecting the New Line WIDESCREEN version.

Since this mistake on the sellers part I have obtained the New Line WIDESCREEN release and it is of considerable higher picture quality so I encourage people wanting the WIDESCREEN New Line version to do their research and ask sellers questions before purchasing. Otherwise you might be stuck with the FULL SCREEN Canadian counterpart like I did.",1372896000,2,1644,5.54183266932271

720729,5,6303697194,Love Lous Gossett Jr.  in everything I've seen him in.  Lots of action and adventure.  Would recomened it to anyone who likes movies about airplanes and kids.,1367193600,,158,4.777777777777778
720730,5,6303697194,"The four aviators and their planes from the WW2 era -- representing Britain, America, Germany and Japan (actors Christopher Cazenove, Louis Gossett Jr., Horst Buchholz and Sonny Chiba) -- keep their skills intact by performing stunt-flying demonstrations at a local airfield; and then Anna (Ms. Olympia Rachel McLish) entangles them in a mission to Peru to save her village from a drug lord and his thugs. It's a delight to see these historic planes flying in formation. A fine action movie with memorable characters by 007 Director John Glen. Rachel McLish is in amazing shape and her character, Anna, does a large share of the fighting.",1364601600,3,638,5.028301886792453
720731,5,6303697194,The story is great but the planes steal the movie.  How can you go wrong with Lou Gossett and always love to see Fred Thompson in anything.  Love that man's voice.  A cast of character actors to die for.  Enjoy this one every time I see it.,1363651200,,240,4.042553191489362

720735,2,6303697194,"I enjoy good adventure movies and I don't think this one qualifies. I couldn't decide whether to give it 2 or 3 stars, I finally decided on 2, it's a weak story line. First the intro with the credits threw me off, I was expecting a typical intro, like the beginning of TV shows such as CSI or NCIS or other Iron Eagle movies. Instead it's done on a completely benign solid color background with no graphics and q-u-i-e-t music--very strange. I don't believe it's a typical Iron Eagle movie, I was never quite sure where the story line was going. There were some enjoyable humorous scenes with a Bill Cosby like actor who was totally out of place, he appears out of the blue with no background or info to weave him in, makes the viewer wonder if the wrong footage was put in... The whole movie is pieces here and there that seem to occur at random. Perhaps this film needed a different director...and producer...and cast....",1357603200,,923,4.5

720795,1,6303697194,"Aces: Iron Eagle III  Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr hits a new career low by returning for this entry, which is among the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen. The recipe for this cinematic disaster takes a director with some good credits on his resume (John Glen-director of five James Bond movies) and puts him in charge of an eclectic cast which includes Horst Bucholz (The Magnificent Seven), Paul Freeman (Raiders of the Lost Ark) Sonny Chiba (The Streetfighter), and Rachel McLish (who looks great but can't deliver a line to save her life); then mixes it well with ridiculous situations, awful dialogue, braindead action sequences and a big collection of obvious toy planes stuffed with TNT. The resulting mishmash is so awful I could almost recommend it for its total lack of quality. Almost.",1229472000,,812,4.970588235294118
720796,3,6303697194,"The Iron Eagle series of films was a silly premise, contrived to get the elements of ground combat, air action, and a tacked on mystery plot all in one movie vehicle.  Unless you were really into seeing aircraft go thru the motions, it never quite worked.  The 3rd in the series, reviewed here, is a thin plot and sop to politics in Latin America.  If you like ""hardbody women""(as do I), and Rachel McLish in particular, then you may find this pretty hot(there are no nude scenes or even anything approaching that though).  She was in great shape and was one of the true ""prima donnas"" of woman's bodybuilding.  So, like her: buy it; else: don't bother..",1204329600,3,654,4.555555555555555
720797,4,6303697194,IRON EAGLE 3 WAS VERY GOOD WITH ALOT OF ACTION IN IT BUT I THINK IRON EAGLE 1 IS BETTER,1186790400,,87,3.4
720798,4,6303697194,"This has meaning to me as I was in Marana, AZ during the filming of this movie and got to meet Lou Gosset Jr. who is the finest of actors and a real gentleman. Seeing first hand, the vintage WWII fighter planes in action was awsome, especially the Zero. We had a part in shooting holes in a piece of an airplane fuselage on the set.  The movie itself was the best of the Iron Eagle Series in my opinion.",1178668800,,403,4.0375
720799,5,6303697194,"Where to begin, when I saw this movie for the first time I just feel in love with Chappy. I have yet to see a movie that even comes close to the quality that this movie embodies. If Chappy were a real person I would marry him and have a life of action and romance in his jet, going really fast all over the world and blowing stuff up. I am not sure if Chappy should be hanging out with little boy though, that could be bad. You know what they say ""16 will get you 20"". You just have to watch this film, you too will be swept away by the passion that Chappy exudes. If I had a chance to save my daddy from the bad guys I would want Chappy by my side, if not sitting on his lap in the cockpit of his jet.",1083888000,,702,3.75
720800,1,6303697194,"This film is spectacularly bad.
A great effort should be made to gather each copy of the film and burn it in an incinerator.",1072828800,2,124,4.208333333333333
720801,3,6303697194,"Clearly the 1992 semi-serious B-movie, Iron Eagle III, while not a great movie, has some great ideas in it--at the end of the film, they show ground troops laser marking enemy targets for prop-driven attack aircraft to fire laser-guided rockets and hit these targets even though friendly civilians were nearby! Pretty amazing for a film in 1992 realizing Close Air Support (CAS) requires slower flying aircraft and to anticipate laser guided rockets! The U.S. Army is today, in 2002 fielding low-cost laser-guided rockets exactly like shown in this movie!
Next, when you overlook the script and enjoy the actual footage of WWII aircraft flying, a P-38 Lightning, P-51 Mustang, T-6 Texan and a Spitfire you'll realize that we have lost a capability with today's fast jets to provide CAS for our ground troops to hold ground, encircle and defeat enemies who may be hiding.
The last aspect viewers may not realize is that the so-called enemy German jet that flies in the final scene is actually Burt Rutan's ARES ""mudfighter"" an actual experimental attack jet designed to do CAS for the Army with a 25mm gatling cannon---exactly the kind of fast when it needs to be, yet-agile-enough to-fly-slow jet that we should have in the U.S. Army firing the laser guided 2.75 inch rockets shot by the good guys in the film!
Watch this movie for the raw aicraft flying footage and an excellent depiction of laser-guided rocket air/ground interface.",1027641600,5,1434,4.979166666666667
720802,3,6303697194,"Chappy Sinclair (Louis Gosset, Jr.) returns in ""Aces: Iron Eagle III"".  Leaving the hi-tech F-16's of the first 2 flicks behind, Chappy spends his time flying restored WWII fighters in air shows along with wartime veterans of the Luftwaffe (Horst Buckholz), the RAF (Christopher Cazenove) and the Japanese Air Force (Sonny Chiba).  He also works with at risk teens nearby a local USAF base.  When one of Chappy's friends is shot down and killed, the retired ace realizes that there's a conspiracy linking a drug cartel south of the border and the corrupt officers running the nearby air force base.  The cartel is run by an ex-Nazi air ace (Paul Freeman), and essentially occupies a picturesque central-American village and its inhabitants.  Gathering the ""aces"" together, and arming their museum-piece planes with real weapons, Chappy and gang head south where they make short work of the drug cartel's private air force, destroy their ground base and save the town.  It's innocuous fun - less Top Gun than an overlong episode of the ""A-Team"" - though not as much fun as the first flick.  The flight scenes are so-so (real aviation fans will quickly realize that Horst Bukholz's german plane gets very little screen time because it's obviously a Mustang; they could have just used a dressed-up T-6, but it would look too closely like the one that's supposed to be Sonny Chiba's
A-6M), but this movie doesn't come out on cable any more so I guess it's worth a rental.",1011830400,6,1467,4.867469879518072
