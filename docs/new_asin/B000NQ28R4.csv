8388321,3,B000NQ28R4,"If you've read the book, the movie is somewhat demure by comparison. Like an Emanuelle movie.",1238371200,,93,4.875
8388322,1,B000NQ28R4,"This was definitely not worth the money. It barely deserves an ""R"" rating.
There is more exposure on Cinemax then in this movie.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",1204329600,7,154,4.7407407407407405
8388323,2,B000NQ28R4,"For those looking for an Emmanuell type picture, this is not it. Granted the lead actor was attractive, but the sex was weak and the story line very flimsy. I bought it thinking it was edgy, and envelope pushing. What I got was some of the worse editing and worse simulated sex ever.
A massive wasteof time and money.",1188864000,27,317,4.389830508474576
