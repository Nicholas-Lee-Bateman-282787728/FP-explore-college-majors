1031904,1,6305473129,"Well, as lamebrained mishmashes of conflicted, cluttered, and uninnovative anime go, I guess Megazone 23 takes the cake, and the pan it sits on, and the oven it was baked in. Just barely lying under the surface, this story of superficiality and illusion, is an analogy to itself.
Well, let's start at the beginning. Shogo Yahagi is an 18 year old McDonald's employee who, as is standard, rides a motorcycle and is a juvenile delinquent in disguise. One of his friends invites him to see a very futuristic looking bike that he says was ""borrowed"" from the company he works for. Right then, some x-files looking agents show up with guns demanding the bike back. In the confusion, Shogo's friend (or just acquaintance?) is killed and Shogo takes off on the bike, soon learning that it can transform into a battle-primed mecha (which he seems to pilot expertly with no training). He soon goes on to use it for his own purposes, like spying on a girl he's interested in, and killing innocent people as he drives down the street with no regard for pedestrians. By coencidental circumstances (by that I mean stopping in a tunnel), Shogo learns that the world he lives in is an artificial world inside a spaceship controlled by a super computer, which is being approached by a UFO, and is currently under danger of being taken over by military subversives.
I thought America was the only one that suffered from the 80's: bad music, bad hair, bad clothes. Yet here we are in Megazone with all the sorry disco-like music and bufont hair. Especially in Flashdance like sequences where a girl dances in spandex and legwarmers. The plot of this story never added up. I mean, for 500 years, this whole population has been living in a spaceship without noticing, and then this guy just takes a wrong turn in a tunnel and finds out the secret. I mean where was all the food coming from? Where were the dead buried? Didn't anyone, like in the Truman Show, come to the end of the city and run into a wall? None of the characters in this series has a clue. This is only Part 1 so I would think more explanation would be given in the second volume, which by the way, I won't buy. Another goofy sidestory is that Shogo and his girlfriends are making an independent film on the side which has the same story as the dvd. Wow, a mirror within a mirror....of lameness.
The only redeeming ideas here were used later on in Dark City and the Matrix films and Akira. Watch any of those films instead of wasting time and money on this dvd.
Features a commentary and production sketches.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, in a scene of Megazone, the mecha are told to use their light sabers, which yes, are exactly like those of Star Wars, even with the ""wowwww, woowww"" sound effects. Also, Shogo's bike sounds suspiciously like the Millenium Falcon as it runs. Awful.",1089158400,5,2830,4.572834645669292
1031905,5,6305473129,"Well, I just bought, and watched, my copy of this CLASSIC ""Japanamation"" (which, for those to young to remember the 80's, is what we use to call ""Anime"" back in the 80's) OVA (which stands for, Original Video Animation, which meant anything that was animated to go straight to video, and not for play on Japanese TV, as most anime was made for, and you thought that you weren't gonna learn anything, by reading this review... lol) MEGAZONE 23, and am QUITE relieved that the new English dub for this new release, isn't ANYWHERE as BAD, as the past reviewers have said that it was.
Sure, most fans of this title, have grown up with the older Streamline Pictures, English dub, which is a nice dub, except for the fact that the three main girls in the story, all sound like  sophisticated ladies, and NOT the young adults that they are actually suppose to be, where as in this new version, the dubbing team has opted for voices that closer mirror the attitudes of the young ladies, which is also nice (my suggestion is that you try and acquire BOTH versions of this anime, so that you can decide for yourself as to which dub you prefer).
Another plus, is the audio commentary (which you should definitely listen to AFTER watching the show if you are new to this title, as there be spoilers afoot, me lads :) which, although, tends to spend more then half of it's time, with the three speakers reminiscing about their old Laser Disc anime collections, does get into some pretty funny good natured kidding about the show itself (i.e. how room items seem to change from scene to scene) and some interesting anecdotal tidbits about the show as well.
The story is shear 80?s, sci-fi-mecha-transformation-actioner, and if you like Macross (or Robotech, as it is widely known here) then you?ll LOVE this, as it?s BIGGER and BADDER, with a nice story.
One thing to take into consideration when watching this though, is he fact that this is part 1 of a 3 part story (actually, really only a 2 part story, as the next part, part 2, really ends the story, where as part 3 is more of an add on to try and cash in on the Akira phenomenon, and, although it has it?s merit, is pretty much a different story) and so, doesn?t have a proper ending, as such, leaving the door WAY open for part 2. So, keep this in mind, as ALL questions WILL be nicely answered, in part 2.
All in all, a nice job was done on this title, and is definitely worth the mula (and for the novice animer out there, this is a title NOT to be missed, trust me ;)",1087516800,5,2514,4.406451612903226
1031906,2,6305473129,"I was so looking forward to this.  The whole series, one dubbing job, done by one of the better anime houses, remastered video, extras, etc., yadda-yadda-yadda.  I am so glad my local video store bought a copy first so I could preview it.
In a word, it sucks.  Not the movie, mind you - Megazone 23 Part 1 is one of the all time great anime OAVs for a multitude of reasons and you can still get the excellent Streamline dub from a variety of sources.  I'm talking about ADV's new dubbing job.  It sucks.  It stinks.  It reeks.  It takes bad dubs of classic anime to an all-new low.  It sounds like a bad fandub recorded inside a junior high school bathroom back at an 80s retro convention.  Yeah, I know all that gnarly tubular ""authentic 80s"" dialogue was supposed to add to the atmosphere of the show, but it just doesn't work, guys!  You had too much fun doing the dub to do a good job, and it shows.  And for all that supposedly careful auditioning, some of the voice actors you chose sound just plain awful!  I'd rather watch it in the original Japanese without subtitles than put up with any more of Yui's screetching blather in the new dub (and yes, I've seen the original in the original Japanese, so shut up otaku)!  And the ""new"" voice of B.D.?!  Don't get me started!  ADV were rushed and they admitted as such in the commentary - and it shows, folks.  It shows.  To borrow a popular 80s catchphrase, it makes me wanna hurl.
Okay, enough of that.  There are actually three good things - small but notable - I have to say about the Megazone 23 Part 1 re-release.  One, ADV did a helluva job of cleaning up the video.  Only the two Hong Kong DVD import releases come close to the visual quality of this video.  Two, after you hold your nose to the audio of the redub, switch over to the commentary track and educate yourself in the lore of two-and-a-half otaku (no, the lady doesn't talk all that much) who really know their anime and really know their stuff about Megazone 23.  I wish their enthusiasm could have carried over into a better dubbing job.  Three, there is the slight (yet to some notable) advantage of having all three installments of the Megazone 23 trilogy all dubbed with the same cast.  Again, minor points but noteworthy ones.
Me?  I'm not buying it for any of those.  In fact, I'm not buying it, period.  Not wasting my money on this one.  If you had gone ahead and put in the extra 10 minutes of Megazone 23 Part 1 that were created for the Robotech movie as a little bonus extra and dubbed those too, then maybe.  As it stands, it goes back on the shelf and my money goes back in my pocket.  I'm sticking with the Streamline dub of Part 1 and will hope ADV does a helluva better job with Part 2.  Yeah, I get tired of hearing the same voices over and over again in Streamline dubs, and the dialogue's not always 100% accurate, but at least those people could act.  I wish I could say the same for ADV's Megazone 23 Part 1 cast.  This dubbing job is almost as bad as a CHE/Peregrine release from the 1990s.  Yeah, I see the smiles.  You remember those.  Does ""Revenge of the Ninja Warrior"" and ""Vengeance of the Space Pirate"" ring a bell?  Okay, maybe not that bad ... but it's in the ballpark, nonetheless.
Out of the zone, ADV.  Take it back and try again.",1086480000,4,3289,4.303425774877651
1031907,5,6305473129,"Megazone 23 was one of the earliest OAV series produced, and was considered groundbreaking when it was released.  I'm really happy that Streamline made part one available on DVD!  Unfortunately, they haven't released the second or third parts yet.  I asked one of the guys working at the Streamline booth at Anime Expo 2001 when they were going to do so, and he said that he didn't know when or even if they were.  Hopefully he was wrong, and the rest will be released domestically!",998092800,,482,4.635294117647059
1031908,5,6305473129,"The Megazone 23 part is the first in a three part series. Our hero named ""Shogo"" stumbles into a secrect military project that forever changes his views on where he lives while at the same time he falls madly in love with the woman of his dreams.  There is so much more in this stroy it is hard to write about it in a review.  Believe me, if you like anime then you will love Megazone 23.  If you never watched anime, then this is one of the best ones you could ever watch.  There is Megazone 23 part two and a part three but these will hopefully become avaliable to us again. I hope you get to watch those as well becuase you can complete the expericance that the creators of the series meant for you to have.  If you can only see the first one you will still be left with a mystery but you will still have an all time classic tale as well.",970704000,,841,4.0119760479041915

7889614,5,6305473129,"MegaZone 23, Part I is one of the pinnacles of classic anime, a juggernaut in its own right. But it needs to be pointed out that there are, in fact, two English dubs of this film... And in my opinion, the first is the superior production.

Now, it's not uncommon for anime to have multiple English dubs. Maybe the old dub doesn't hold up, maybe the producers can't track down any high quality masters, maybe there are rights issues, the reasons are endless. MegaZone 23 is one of these multidub productions. It was originally dubbed and released on VHS in 1995 by Streamline Pictures, and this version was later rereleased in 1999 on DVD by Image Entertainment. This ""Streamline dub"" is superb, with perfectly-cast actors and believable, nuanced performances. While the script plays a bit loose with the actual dialogue, the original characters and story are not sacrificed in any way, and the final result is a realistic-sounding dub with dialogue that flows beautifully in the English language.

Eventually, Streamline Pictures shut down and Image's rights to MegaZone lapsed. In 2004, ADV Films relicensed MegaZone 23, Parts I, II, and III, for a remastered rerelease on DVD. Now, at this point, Carl Macek, the guy who helmed the first dub, was working at ADV, as their DVD rereleases of Macek's earlier Robotech show. With the superb quality of the first dub and the presence of the original dub director in the offices, one would think that it'd be a cinch to simply commission dubs of Parts II and III from the original cast at Intersound (the first dub's recording studio) and retain the old dub of Part I. However, ADV instead opted to forgo that route and create an all-new, in-house dub. And as much as I love ADV, the end result was less than stellar.

I won't sugarcoat things: the ADV dub of MegaZone sucks. Many of the biggest key roles are horribly miscast and overacted (Shogo sounds obnoxious and hyperactive, Yui sounds nasally most of the time, Mori and Chombo sound like cartoonish caricatures of themselves), and while the script generally adheres closer to the original Japanese, no effort is made to make anything flow well in English, and to make up for it, ADV added tons of out-of-place one-liners (""Robot bike, don't fail me now!""), failed attempts at humor (""He drop kicked a cop car?"", where said kick was not a dropkick at all) and some just plain old stupid-sounding lines (""Eight? As in... Date, right?!""). It almost seems as if the people behind the ADV dub lacked respect or understanding of the source material, whereas the Streamline dub treated the film with the utmost reverence. And in both cases, the treatment of the work behind the scenes shows through in the final product.

I love MegaZone 2e, Part I. It's one of my favorite anime. But if you want to see it in English, go for the Streamline dub as opposed to the one from ADV. It's by far the superior dub.",1395100800,2,2903,4.7312252964426875
7889615,4,6305473129,"cool animation,awesome soundtrack and familiar storyline.it all makes up for an awesome retro/futuristic robot anime! Reminds me of Robotech in a way ,some of the dubs sound overexagerated at times but it's not too bad. I'd still like to watch the original vhs verson,I am a fan of the older dubs myself. A few too many nudy scenes for my taste but it follows the story so it's okay. The robot bike is pretty tight!

It is a shame that the story seems somewhat incomplete we never get the opportunity to see Megazone 23's enemies and there is no conclusion to the BD problem..is he evil or not?, what is he tryint to do? , there is a sex scene here, and also a love story inside the movie.  I hope someday , a director tries to improve the story and the characters in an updated version of Megazone 23, it is truly a classic.

  The animation is good overall , considering that it was 1986 when this anime was released.",1183075200,,676,4.052631578947368
7889617,3,6305473129,"Well, I paid $21.99 for this DVD, was it worth the price?

Not really.

I will show the greatness of MZ 23, and then it's drawbacks.

MZ's greatness- The story is original.

The Garland mech is sweet, and an innovative design overall.

Eve was/is a cool digital pop idol before Sharon Apple even hit the radar.

Mikimoto's art is sublime (in an 80's kind of way)...

MZ's drawbacks- It is sooo 1980s. I mean, in a painful way. But not as 1980s a Part II, ick.

It drags on, and on, and on...with next to no action.

The ending is well, not an ending. It makes you think Shogo is running, severely injured, trying to reunite with Yui, but Part II proves that assumption dead in the water.

It has nudity, which is tastefully done I might add, but it might be a drawback for some.

If you can snag it for $15 or under it is a solid buy for the retro 80's effect. But at what I paid, um not a good value.",1171584000,,901,4.091428571428572
7889618,4,6305473129,"The excellent story line in this anime could have led to a classic in the Sci-Fi Anime genre, however, the ending left me saying, ""Huh?""

It's not a cliff hanger ending either, just a bit of a thud... reminiscent of the animated Lord of the Rings ending. Remember that one? :-)

I love the visuals, though most of the animation is unpolished by todays anime standards.",1140220800,,368,4.5606060606060606
