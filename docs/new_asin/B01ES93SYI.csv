I had to turn it off about 20 minutes in because the acting was so stiff and just wretched. The truth is, we need a serious movie about the tragedy that has been our past. In the right hands, it will be known by many more humans. After all, Hitler based the Jewish genocide on the Armenian one.",1500249600,,438,4.104651162790698
