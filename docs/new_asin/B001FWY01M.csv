The video quality was poor, it struggled to go into full screen, and when it did the aspect ratio was off so there were 1 inch black bars on each side of the video. I don't mind paying for media, and I don't mind poorer quality free media, but if I'm going to shell out 3 bucks I think it should really be better than this.",1392336000,2,389,4.131578947368421
8302918,5,B001FWY01M,"Fantastic film. 1st off, if you're looking for a popcorn movie or a nicely coherent plot, this probably isn't the right flick. Elia Suleiman's films are for reflection and a discerning viewer; vignettes sprinkled with a humor to lighten a pervasive tension. Think of a Palestinian Buster Keaton with a hint of Woody Allen.

Suleiman asserts that he is not out to send ""a message"" about Palestine, this is not a heroic documentary of resistance, rather the film portrays the suffocation of occupation and how it pervades into the banalities of daily life. His old neighborhood is filled with people crippled by ambivalence and resigned to simply waiting in their ghetto, for what, we can't know. Everything is meticulously shot in a way that sucks you into the scene; the human interaction, or rather lack thereof, is touching and helps to relate the characters, not as Palestinian freedom-fighters, but occupied peoples throughout the world.

If you want a few good chuckles, complex character relationships, and a movie that will keep you thinking long after the credits: do yourself a favor and watch this (along with Suleiman's other films).",1366675200,2,1144,5.079787234042553
8302919,1,B001FWY01M,"This movie was terrible. This movie is the one that needs a ""divine intervention"" Spare me pls!  I watched for as long as I could stand it and then I simply had to stop! I wish I could get a divine intervention and get my $2.99 back.
I do not recommend this movie to anyone, and for the record, I am NOT into blockbusters, but seriously, this was the worst movie I have ever seen.",1336348800,,380,4.066666666666666
8302920,5,B001FWY01M,"Beautiful, interesting, esoteric. If you're into blockbusters, you probably won't get it. Then again, I doubt anyone who knows about this film is into blockbusters.",1302220800,2,164,5.6
