486199,5,6302559316,"I have over 35 ski movies at my ski house. This tape is played more than all the rest put together. While I will admit that most of these bands are no longer together, the sound track is fantastic. The skiing while not as extreme as what you may find on today's ski movies, at the time very few were skiing this stuff. The short clip showing Glen Plake trying to open a bottle of champagne at Chominx is classic along with the story of ""The Tree"". I have been to squaw and tried to ski the Palisades and its not as easy as these guys make it look on this film. This is on of my all time favorites and i wish Greg Stump would re-release this on DVD before my VHS copy is worn out from the constant replaying.",1177718400,2,707,4.0212765957446805
486200,4,6302559316,"I've owned this VHS tape for years, and every winter I pull it out to fire-up for the ski season The movie has an electrified 80's sound track as the back drop for action packed extreme skiing done by ""R.A.D"" 80's ski hippies.  I love the dated 80's teen-speak...it's much cooler than Warren Miller's tiresome narrative and never-ending goofy quips.  The straight-cut K2s and the florescent skiwear is a walk down memory lane, but the athleticism and the technical skiing expertise is timeless.  I've tried to find the Acid House Audio sound track unsuccessfully.  I'm gonna buy another Stump movie and see if I get the same charge out of it!",1167955200,,642,4.756756756756757
486201,1,6302559316,"I heard about this video long before I finally saw this video.  And I bought it mostly because I heard such good things, especially about the sound track.  What a bunch of bull!  This movie was a let down from start to end.
  First off, let us begin with the film itself.  It is 75 minutes long, but the film itself it only 40 minutes long.  The remaining time is wasted on a ridiculously long trailer before the film begins and another wasteful ""intermission"" during the middle of the movie.  This intermission and trailer is nothing but evidence that this film did not have a decent editor or the film-makers wanted to pad the movie.
  Second, lets get to the ski footage.  I saw better ski footage on re-runs of MTV Sports, and I hated MTV Sports!  All the ski footage is shown in slow motion, making me think I was watching a bad Beer commercial.  I kept waiting for a Miller Lite logo to pop up.  If you think you are going to see ""extreme"" ski footage, you will be disappointed.  And why will you be? Read on.
  Third, the skiers in this film are a joke.  A bunch of pudgy middle aged hipsters falling down mountains as they tell war stories about all the time they have fallen down mountains.  However, one must keep this film in context.  This film was made in the mid 1980s, and back then most the ski slopes were strictly the domain of upper class sportmen.  Which explains why so many stars of this film look like they got lost on their way to Wall Street.  Never have I seen so many ""extreme athletes"" with male pattern baldness.
  Fourth, the music of this movie was indeed a let down.  I was expecting a soundtrack made up of punk rock groups that I had never heard of.  Instead, I get ""Frankie Goes Hollywood""?!?!?.
This soundtrack is a fine cheese of 1980s muzak that was not good enough to make it onto the ""Big Chill"" soundtrack.  If you buy this movie just to hear the music, just remember that ""Frankie Goes Hollywood"" is the biggest name of it, the rest are no doubt long since broken up groups who thought that this film was going to be their big break.  Pity them.",1076889600,,2087,4.322997416020672

7828062,4,6302559316,"Five stars if you can find the original. This version has had it's soundtrack altered. I'm guessing due to licensing issues.

Stump didn't just choose popular songs he knew would sell. He curated soundtracks using new music which shared the same edge as his films. In my humble opinion, the Prime version suffers because of the substitutions.

Do Stump a favor and buy these directly from him. He's online. You get them on DVD with his assistant's handwriting on the label. It's awesome.",1500163200,,487,4.855421686746988
