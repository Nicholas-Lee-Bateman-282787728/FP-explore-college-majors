8121290,2,B000FDFPMU,Sort of bland and unmemorable.  I watched this like 4 days ago and already I can barely remember what happened. Something about Mossad and a prostitute or something?,1438819200,,165,4.892857142857143
8121291,4,B000FDFPMU,"Very well written and acted by an international cast. Resembles the 1980's Pollard story, which is still in the news.",1397520000,,117,4.9
8121292,3,B000FDFPMU,"This French film ""The Patriotes"" (French Title), The Patriots (English Title) [...] 1994, traces the career of a young Frenchman who joins Israeli intelligence. His first assignment involves compromise of a French scientist working on an Arab probable nuclear weapons plant, which leads to an Israeli Air Force attack on a nuclear site (On June 7, 1981 Israeli warplanes struck the Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad.).

The second assignment is about a real case also, Office of Naval Intelligence analyst Johnathan Pollard, except for a name change to Jeremy Pelman of the National Security Agency. Based on books about the Pollard case by Olive and Blitzer, The Patriots got it 100% right, even to wife's red hair, Pollard's temperment and working for a special unit (LAKAM), not the Mossad.

Highly recommended if you like ""spy genre"" and/or followed the Pollard story. English subtitles.
