8122128,3,B000FGFBLM,"Martial artist Steven Vincent Leigh was an action film regular through the early-mid -90s B-movie scene, and just before he departed that particular arena for shorter-lived stint in television, he finally received an action vehicle of his own. Admittedly, Leigh had in the past played the immediate runner-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russell-Wong/dp/6302187370/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russell Wong</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-Wilson/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don Wilson</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Wincott/dp/B00009MEFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Wincott</a>, but this was the first time that he clearly got top billing. As nice as this is, it's a bit disappointing that his platform for it wasn't better: though ""Sword of Honor"" packs a lot of good talent and eventually is the best vehicle for a fan to watch Leigh in action, it's a noticeably cheap, questionably-written movie that doesn't do as much as it could with its premise.

The story: when his partner is killed during a confrontation with robbers, a policeman (Leigh) finds himself caught up in an underworld game of greed involving a mythical and very expensive Mongolian sword.

Know right away that despite the word ""sword"" being in this one's title, there's only one genuine swordfight in the film, and it's not very long. However, unless you had your heart set on swordfights, this isn't a bad thing, since the ten hand-to-hand fights aren't bad. Four of these include Hong Kong veteran Sophia Crawford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/US-Seals-2/dp/B0028OA30S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">US Seals 2</a>) and fight coordinator Jeff Pruitt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-of-Justice/dp/6302586313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission of Justice</a>) in rare character roles as Leigh's allies, and given the quality of the rest of the film, most of the fights are better than expected. There's a good deal of impressive kicking and acceptable camerawork, and the only real drawback is that none of these fighters are given any decent opponents: the only genuine one-on-one fight is a fun but meaningless match between a nameless bouncer and Tsuyoshi Abe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bounty-Tracker/dp/078200167X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bounty Tracker</a>), and after that, it's mostly one-against-many setups that get a tad boring after a while.

Though the movie was produced within the gold era of high-quality direct-to-video action outings, ""Sword of Honor"" was produced in Australia and features weaker-than-average production values. They're not so weak that you wouldn't enjoy the film because of them, but there's an abundance of scenes filmed with handheld cameras that give the impression they were shot under a hasty schedule. Though a good deal of the picture takes place on a Las Vegas-esque gambling strip with plenty of gaudy lights and snazzy casino settings, the video is stifled by an unsaturated, muddy picture quality which probably reflects the type of film that was used. Additionally supporting my theory of a cheap production is that the cast seems to be littered with family members of director Robert Tiffe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchetman/dp/B0002MFFH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchetman</a>) - not a bad thing in itself, but you can take that as you please.

I'm also displeased at the focus of the story: I don't mind following Steven, Sophia, and Jeff's characters around, but the activities of the Mafioso faction just don't interest me as much. It would've been cool if the early scene taking place in 12th century Mongolia had been elaborated on, but the supposed importance of the Sword of Honor is more or less forgotten for most of the movie - possibly to ensure that the film wouldn't take a turn in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B001JFZ118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>-style direction, but that would've been a lot more conversational than what we have instead. The result of all this coming together is an unenthusiastic three-star rating. Definitely check this one out if you want to see Steven in action, but remember that several of his co-starring roles are better than this one.",1360800000,,4527,6.428571428571429
8122129,5,B000FGFBLM,The thing that makes this movie worth seeing is a chance to see Charlie Vespia play the body builder wise guy. All of the other actors in the movie pale in comparison to the performance done here by one of the greatest up and comers in the film industry tragically cut short before his time. The scene in which Charlie is in the gym is the most memorable. He is fantastic and his martial arts never looked better. I am a big fan of his from days gone by and would like to also add that he was/is and always will be my idol. R.I.P. Charlie..I love you. I always knew that you would be a star someday and here you are immortalized forever online. I miss you big brother. Everyone see this movie so my brothers memory will not be forgotten.

8122131,2,B000FGFBLM,"The title, Sword of Honor, makes it sound like this sword is like the Ring in Lord of the Rings, especially when the opening scene takes place centuries ago as a prologue to the special quality of the sword. But it just serves as a prop to a standard B martial arts/action movie flick.

Cop gets killed on his last day of duty.  His partner seeks revenge, and falls in love with his partner's sister.  The bad guys have dirty cops planted in the division.  Climaxes with a fight scene.  Nothing wrong with formula films - I love B movies - but this one falls a little short.  Plots are not what ""B"" action movies are about - Action sequences are - and the fight scenes, although there are quite a few, are not memorable, and quantity does not mean quality.

What I did like was Steven Vincent Leigh as the lead, and though known to play villians, thought he displayed the good guy qualities well. Leigh and Jeff Pruitt, who plays his partner have good teamwork, and it's too bad Pruitt's character gets killed in the beginning.  Come to think of it, the fight scenes in the beginning of the movie where the two are fighting criminals are the better fight scenes of the movie.  Female kickboxer, Sophia Crawford plays Pruitt's sister and a scene where she and Leigh scare off a group who want to steal Crawford's car is also a fight scene that is up to par.

To sum up, this movie is a standard B movie, not terrible, is satisfactory, but there are better choices out there in this genre.",1242432000,4,1487,4.394160583941606
8122132,3,B000FGFBLM,"This is a typical B-martial arts movie for the most part, though I enjoyed some elements of the story more than anything else.  Steven Vincent Leigh (Ring of Fire, To Be The Best, Deadly Bet) plays the lead, a cop named Johnny.  This is probably the only martial arts film he has starred in as a good guy.  After seeing his performance in Sword of Honor, I'd have to say he is better off playing a villain.  The remainder of the cast is not too familiar, and mostly give so-so performances.  There is plenty of action, but most of the fights are rather short and uninspiring.  There is a scene that I crave with these American made films, where 2 guys fight on the dance floor at a club, but again it is kind of short and nothing too special.

What I enjoyed most about this film, and the only thing that saved it for me, was the focus around the bad guys and their boss.  I won't spoil anything, but in the end it is not the underworld boss who ends up being the true villain.  Some cops also get involved with the bad guys.  Thats been done before, but it adds to the spice of things here.  As far as the whole Sword of Honor concept, that didn't grab my attention very much, and supposedly whoever claims the sword is undefeatable.  The story focused mostly on Johnny getting revenge on the bad guys for killing his partner - which is not an original concept at all.

Overall, the fight action was dissapointing.  Steven Leigh usually gives more in many of his films, and his final fight in the film against the villain I thought was rather weak.  It was obvious his opponent was no match for him, and therefore was not an evenly matched fight at all.  But in the end, it wasn't the action that grabbed my attention from this film.

I would not recommend this film for great martial arts action.  Even a fan of Steven Leigh might be disappointed.  The story is about the most enjoyable aspect of the film, though certain elements are forgettable and others not.",1187568000,5,1964,4.360881542699724
8122133,1,B000FGFBLM,"This is more of a C-movie, than a B-movie.  Cable stations play garbage like this most of the day outside of the once a day that they show film you'd want to see.  I can imagine puerile people liking this, but no one else.

If people fought in real life as much as they do here, we'd practically be living like ""Fight Club.""  There was a fight that took place in a gymnasium.  How did the fighters not wound themselves on nearby machinery?  Why didn't the gym owner kick them out or call the police?

This is a heteropatriarchal film where there is female nudity, but no male nudity.  I love that the main character is portrayed by a man that challenges the racist stereotype of the physically weak Asian-American male.  However, he has a body that we only get to see occasionally.  He doesn't really show any commitment to other Asians or helping the Asian-American community.

This DVD had no added features.  Again, only watch this if you like movies that drain your head of brain cells.",1173571200,2,990,4.5
8122134,5,B000FGFBLM,"Very good B-Grade movie starring Steven Vincent Leigh, he is truly a good martial artist. Sophia Crawford was also good and had some good fight scenes as well, for those who aren't aware of who she is, she's a European Kickboxing Champion. Right from the beginning of the movie when the samurai warrior was surround by several opponents and started kicking their butts and slicing them with his sword I knew that this film was going to be a good movie because the fight scenes were well put together. I payed $45 dollars US for this film but was worth it in my personal opinion as I enjoy watching B-Grade martial arts movies (and collecting them) as long as they are not too stupid with the fight scenes. What I mean by that is some movies have very bad sound effects when the actor/actress might throw a kick or punch and the punch is obviously a weak one, however, the opponent goes flying...thats what I mean by stupid. Anyway, Steven shows his talent well in this movie with his acting abilities as well as his martial arts skills. The fight scenes were very good and has plenty of action.

This movie is about a young cop called Johnny who is called as back up to a shoot-out while celebrating the end of his partner's retirement day. He invites his partner to the battle for one last feeling of being a cop before turning into a civilian. Johnny and his partner are taken by surprise when they arrive at the robbery and Johnny's partner is killed. Johnny discovered that his only link to finding his partner's killer is the ancient Sword Of Honor which is wanted by an Underworld Boss because with the history of the sword it is said that whoever owns the sword can not be defeated by anyone. Johnny teams up with his partner's sister (Sophia Crawford) a martial arts instructor. Eventually, Johnny learns that he is not only up against the Las Vegas Underworld but some members from his own poilce team as well!",1137974400,5,1919,4.530259365994237
