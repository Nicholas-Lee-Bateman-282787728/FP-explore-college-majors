4981815,4,B006AQG6II,I had to tell my computer that I was in Europe to get this to play.  Something about the DVD not being copyrighted to show in my country.,1456790400,,137,3.892857142857143
4981816,5,B006AQG6II,Possibly one of the best of the Disney classics.  I was a bit surprised at the aspect ratio being 2.55:1 (although I would have known had I read the product description) when all the previous Disney classic Blu-rays I've purchased were 1.33:1.  In looking around it seems that is the standard aspect ratio for this movie but it's odd to get a 1080p Blu-ray movie that displays on my HD TV with the large bars at the top and bottom.  Maybe this movie is just a lot wider than the others?,1456358400,5,486,4.318681318681318

4981818,5,B006AQG6II,"This is a Christmas gift for a 7 year-old little girl. I remember very little about this movie at present (I was a young girl when I last saw this film), so I had to read the reviews to refresh my memory. I am hopeful that this gift will bring joy and fond memories for this intended little angel girl.",1448236800,,302,4.05

4981820,5,B006AQG6II,One of Disney's top five children's films of all time.,1510012800,,54,4.5
4981821,5,B006AQG6II,"Christmas has arrived in a quaint middle class town and Jim Dear gives his wife Darling a Cocker Spaniel puppy named Lady as a gift. Lady forms friendships with the other neighborhood dogs and needs them the most when Jim Dear and Darling ignore her during Darlings pregnancy. Among the neighborhood dogs is a homeless drifter named Tramp, who shows Lady how to have a good time and live adventurously. With devious Siamese cats, authoritative dog catchers, and a nasty Aunt Sarah as her antagonists, Lady gladly goes on romantic getaways with Tramp, but also feels a sense of duty to protect Jim Dear and Darlings newborn son. Will Lady ever find the acceptance she needs?

Im not going to lie: I came close to crying several times during this movie. Thats right: a grown man almost cried to a Disney movie. Sue me. Jim Dear and Darlings cold behavior towards Lady in the beginning is one of the catalysts for sure. The choir of locked up doggies at the pound singing and howling their hearts out reminded me of what my elderly dog Maggie does when she gets lonely and confused. Aunt Sarah blaming Lady for a mess her stupid Siamese cats made got my blood boiling, especially when Sarah decides to put a muzzle on Lady shortly thereafter. Any further divulging of information will result in spoilers, but I will say that listening to Lady crying alone in her doghouse was nearly the breaking point for me and the floodgates protecting my eyeballs. Damn you, Disney. Damn you!

Such a tear-jerking reaction can only come from an audience who cares deeply about the characters the awful things are happening to. Unless you have a heart of stone, you damn well should care about the neighborhood puppies. Theyre cute, they're bouncy, they're friendly and lovable, and they're worthy of getting infinite belly rubs and an endless supply of puppy burgers from McDonalds. Just picture how happy one of these dogs would be if you took him to McDonalds for a plain McDouble. Actually, you don't have to picture it for long, because theres always that infamous scene where Lady and Tramp eat a plate of spaghetti together. The fact that Tony the Italian restaurant owner cares enough about dogs to feed them his finest cuisine is heartwarming to me. Aunt Sarah should be taking notes. Puppy-duppies want delicious food, not muzzles.

If you're an animal lover like I am, don't pass up an opportunity to watch this Disney classic. If nothing else, itll make you appreciate your pets more. If they're feeling lonely or confused, give them pettings and love. Treat them to a nice cuisine every once and a while. Snuggle with them. Let them sleep on your bed and curl up by your pillow. Animals don't have a long lifespan, so its important that we make every moment with them count. A happy animal means a happy owner and a happy owner will feel the dams breaking when he buys a copy of Lady and the Tramp. An extra credit grade will go to this super sweet classic!",1508457600,,2953,4.664107485604607

I'm happy to report it's playing just fine and the quality/sound is excellent. No discernible difference from any other DVD I've purchased. For comparison: we live in Florida and we are using a five year old Samsung blu-ray and a Samsung smart TV both purchased in the US. Hope this helps.",1496188800,14,396,4.513888888888889
