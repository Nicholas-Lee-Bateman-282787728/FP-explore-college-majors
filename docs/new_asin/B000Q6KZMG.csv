8194652,4,B000Q6KZMG,"The quality is as good as could be expected.  Keep in mind that in could only have been taken from very old reel film.  I purchased this solely for Snake Crane Secret, but it seems to have had the first 5 - 10 minutes edited out.  I hate that.

If you are after the COMPLETE version, keep hunting.",1200614400,,297,4.068965517241379
8194653,5,B000Q6KZMG,"This Is A Double Feature On One DVD...; Snake Crane Secret Needs No Mentioning, It Is A Classic In It's Own Right. Delung Tam And Meng Fei Are Just Pure Geniuses In This, Along With The Great Ti Lung. In The Second Feature, I Have To Say This Is One Of The More Better Works Of Carter Wong's That Has Gone Unnoticed. I Don't Know Why They Gave It This Title As Shown On This Flick, But The Original Title Name Is EMPEROR OF SHAOLIN KUNG FU. I Have To Say This Is A Must For The Classics, And Definitely A Collectors Item. You Don't Wanna Miss Having This In Your Collections. It Is Totally Awesome. This Flick Will Have You Sitting On The Edge Of Your Seat. The Plot And Story Is Teriffic, And Lo Lieh Is Sensational. This One Really Got Me Gripping My Seat. Definitely A 5 Star.",1179964800,3,779,4.1655629139072845
