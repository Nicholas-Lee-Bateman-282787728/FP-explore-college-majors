5726016,5,B00CLGCSCE,"FOX must be commended for their clear and penetrating review on the evils of the abortion industry and how it has been systematically hidden from the conscience of the American public.  FOX is and has  been my exclusive source of news and information and their excellence in fair, balanced and truthful journalism is unsurpassed.  It stands unique.  What I'd like to see now is a special about the destructive cultural war being waged in this country by a select few in the news and entertainment industry who have access to the hearts and minds of the malleable masses.

May God bless FOX and those responsible.

Sincerely,

Samuel and Barbara  Gullo",1367625600,7,651,4.8545454545454545
5726017,5,B00CLGCSCE,"This is a very well produced and riveting presentation of the trial of a Philadelphia abortionist.  The facts are presented graphically, based on courtroom testimony.  There may be viewers who can see this and still prate about ""reproductive rights"" (a truly Orwellian label for abortion).  Very well.  But now I understand how the Holocaust was possible.  Almost unimaginable evil can disguise itself as ""health services.""  People will do as they are told, even to the point of committing ghastly acts.  This happened in America: not in some backwater locale, but in Philadelphia, formerly famous as one of the cultural centers of our country, and the home of the Liberty Bell.
I don't wish to argue with people about the abortion issue.  I would only ask that everyone watch this, and think very, very hard.  Unlike most of the news media, we must confront what has been happening to our country, our culture, and the lives of the innocent here in ""the Heaven-rescued land,"" our America.",1367625600,7,989,4.945454545454545
5726018,5,B00CLGCSCE,"This Special program is an extremely comprehensive explanation of the barbarity of Kermit Gosnell, MD's business practices in Philadelphia. Pro-life/anti-abortion advocates cringe at the idea of ending the life of viable babies, but every person should also cringe at the inhumanity with which Dr. Gosnell treated his adult patients.

Just seeing drawings of the faces of his accomplices shown on this Special makes me feel like I have witnessed the horror of a gulag or concentration camp. How 'ordinary' people could have accepted the work environment and work 'product' is just very difficult to comprehend. How could they look at their clients with any kind of human feeling? How could they operate in the filthy conditions and keep dead babies in freezers? And severed feet kept as souvenirs?

The reason that Gosnell was able to make large amounts of money from his services, is because he was the ultimate resource when the criteria of other agencies would reject an abortion request. The Women's Medical Society in Philadelphia was a referral center for other abortionists!

Hosted by Brett Baier, the show includes courtroom observations by lawyer, Kimberly Guilfoyle, medical commentary by Dr Manny Alvarez, an OB/GYN physician, and others.",1367625600,10,1250,5.303030303030303
5726019,5,B00CLGCSCE,"With America. If America doesn't wake up and return back to our foundations of our forefathers we will be doomed.
God have mercy on this country. I am so livid after watching this. This evil, demonic demon doctor, should not even be allowed to take another breath.
And Obama praised planned parenthood with an unqualified endorsement yesterday at their annual national conference..??.?
This is the same president who has disregarded religious freedom, requiring non-profit organizations, charities and for-profit business owners with strong religious beliefs to pay for contraceptives and possible abortion-causing drugs in employee healthcare plans.
Obama says pro-life forces want to return the nation to the 1950s. While that certainly was not a good time for the civil rights of African Americans or workplace opportunities for women, it was a much better time for survival if you were a preborn baby. It was a time when we didn't abort a million of our children each year; when women weren't widely exploited by pornography, when sex trafficking was unheard of and divorce was rare.

The president ended his speech by saying, ""God bless you"" to Planned Parenthood. Let's pray that God will so radically impact the hearts of our leaders that our prevailing policies will protect the innocent and restore religious freedomso that our nation can once again be one that God can bless.",1367539200,9,1385,5.183035714285714
5726020,5,B00CLGCSCE,"This was a very disturbing program to watch, and it staggers the imagination why nothing was done for so long, to bring this guy in.  Why, one might ask, would a defense attorney want to discredit the prosecution, and try to make this a race issue, because the abortionist/murderer was a black person?  The guy admitted to killing live babies - outside the womb!  Then the judge threw out three of the seven (babies b, f, and g) before the jury even got the case.  Is justice being served, or is this judge looking for loopholes or technicalities, to somehow ""lessen"" the crimes that have been committed?  Was anybody going to stand up and do their job?

The worst part was seeing bloody pictures of viable human beings who had their necks punctured and spinal cords severed to make sure they would not live - before they were stored in a refrigerator or put in a glass jar.  And I thought partial-birth abortion was bad.

Maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to a nation that says the constitution protects abortion and revisit the endorsement given to such activities.",1367539200,22,1073,4.610526315789474
5726021,5,B00CLGCSCE,"This case is horrifying, but that is what abortion is.  Sometimes the truth hurts, and everyone needs to see this video",1367539200,20,119,4.666666666666667
5726022,5,B00CLGCSCE,"An outstanding work of reporting the facts and the history of the Gosnell case, which is more about the complacency of the media and the pro-abortion state and local officials who were willing to ""look the other way"" when these obvious crimes were committed right under their noses for over 30 years. The Gosnell case is the ""perfect storm"" of the abortion story in the USA.  Once the Supreme Court has legalized abortion throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy and has provided giant loopholes to allow killing unborn children in the womb  at late gestational ages where they could have easily survived outside the womb -- then infanticide is the logical extension of this reasoning if the child happens to be born alive.

Gosnell's logical conclusion that it is easier to kill the child outside the womb than to do so by dismembering the unborn child inside the womb (which would not have incurred any criminal charges) exposes the ultimate logical extension of of the abortion ""right"" in the first place -- not simply a so-called choice to terminate a pregnancy (after all, every pregnancy is naturally ""terminated"" when the child is born) -- and not simply a ""right"" to be free from the obligations of raising a child (after all, that right can be fulfilled by the loving and life giving act of adoption)  -- no -- not either of these -- it is the newly created ""right"" to a dead child, and a ""right"" to pretend that the child never even existed!

The ""secondary gain"" to society of not having to face the costs and the burden of raising so-called ""unwanted"" children is what motivates our public officials and the media to ""look the other way"" when such obvious crimes are committed

Every single person interested in the truth about abortion, whether pro-life or pro-choice, should see this documentary.",1367539200,37,1816,4.80448717948718
8583081,5,B00CLGCSCE,"What a powerful story.  How could we
get to this point in our society.",1410739200,,70,4.0
8583082,5,B00CLGCSCE,This was an excellent documentary done by Fox News.  Mainstream media did nothing to report on the atrocities that Dr. Gosnell performed in the name of an abortionist.  See how the health system failed to monitor this abortion clinic.  Cops went there because of him selling drugs and found hundred of dead babies.  Filthy beds laiden with blood.  This is a difficult movie to watch and truly is the essence of Evil personfied in a man who calls himself a doctor.,1372982400,,463,4.666666666666667
8583083,4,B00CLGCSCE,Good quality DVD copy of the (sad) story as reported on TV.  This case demonstrates the relative ease of slipping from a lawful act to acts of murder.,1372896000,3,150,4.357142857142857
8583084,5,B00CLGCSCE,"It was very informative, excellent tape
It had information that I believe the voting public should see, is abortion really a good thing for Women?",1372377600,3,146,4.88
8583085,5,B00CLGCSCE,"This video should be required viewing for every freshman high school kid. I purchased it for my 9 grandchildren to see. This puts the true face on what ""choice"" really means. Bottom line, when a girl gets pregnant, she is going to have a baby--one way or the other and abortion is painful( it appears--as much or more than natural birth )and dangerous. These mothers could have given those beautiful babies to childless couples and been hero's instead of murderers. Shame on Planned Parenthood and all the other providers of this hideous practice and Shame on them for convincing young girls that this an OK solution.",1371081600,4,617,4.830188679245283
8583086,5,B00CLGCSCE,This video shows how Gosnell's whole career was spent killing innocent life and the systems put in place turned their heads to even check on complaints. It is worth it to see what is going on behind closed doors to the most unregulated clinics.,1370908800,2,244,4.568181818181818
8583087,5,B00CLGCSCE,"this documentary about Gosnell was so disturbing it could have just as well been about Dr. Mengle - what was going on in that clinic is truly that horrific.  The fact that this is going on in America, and most of the media is ignoring it, is outrageous.  Kudos to fox for their outstanding reporting and for bringing this to light.",1367884800,,331,4.409836065573771
8583088,5,B00CLGCSCE,Saw it on Fox News on 5/5/13.  Great documentery but don't watch unless you have a strong stomach.  Proves abortion is murder! I plan to provide a copy to our Library and make others aware of this 45 minute film.  Where do we get abortion monsters like Gosnell.  Put this guy and his wife away.  They have no hearts.,1367712000,2,316,4.288135593220339
8583089,5,B00CLGCSCE,"I cannot imagine ANYONE whose conscience is not deeply stirred about this subject. The total lack of worth of a human life screams out at you. Planned Parenthood needs to be de-funded, further investigated and more criminal filings on those who participate, perform and authorize this inhumanity to innocent life.",1367712000,6,313,5.28
8583090,5,B00CLGCSCE,"We must wake up as a nation.  Babies are the most innocent among us.  This case shines a bright light on the murdering of these children.  Where is our humanity and our since of protection for these children?  Where are the rights of these children?  Who indeed will cry for these children?  This cannot go on in our land and be looked over.  This is murder, period!  Fox News reported on what we should be hearing from other news sources.  Have we gone so far that we cannot even tell when murder is murder?  This report is very disturbing but necessary.  This report causes one to look and see the horrific thing that has happened.  Not talking about it does not make it go away.  This report pulls the blinds up and exposes the truth of how these babies died.  Little human beings who had no one to protect them; no one to help them in their greatest need.  Let us look at this and see it for what it is.  Let us cry for these children.",1367625600,9,939,4.220338983050848
