5840216,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Kudos to WB for releasing this film in a single package.

The story is legendary.  The cast is incredible.  The animation is excellent.  This may be the best Batman film ever made, trumping even the works of Nolan.  A large part is due to its loyalty to the source, Frank Miller's epic dystopian tale.

There are many layers inside the story.  Social commentary.  Political commentary.  But at its core we find out what drives Batman and why he is so important.  Not only that, but we get to see the two great superheroes go at it when Superman and Batman go toe-to-toe.

WB is packing a lot into this new release.  The only shame I can see is that they're not giving the full film a theatrical release.  It deserves one.  The quality is there and as a singular film, it moves at a fast pace.  I would love to see this one on the big screen in the Fall.",1374364800,31,853,4.24375
5840217,5,B00DP9MDE4,"For fans thinking they are being 'double dipped' by this DC Universe Animated Original Movie 'Deluxe Edition' release of 'BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS,' think again.  You only need look at what you are getting for your money to realize Warner Bros. animation is offering up a totally new 'viewing experience' for this groundbreaking animated achievement, along with phenomenal new extras well worth the investment.  The full-length, uninterrupted version of the film clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes.  That makes this uninterrupted viewing experience the closest fans will get to a Christopher Nolan 'Batman' film, perhaps, for the last time ever.

The fact that the entire version features a crew commentary track exclusive to this 'full-cut' means that fans get a creative perspective on the film as a whole.  Had commentary tracks been recorded and released on each of the separate 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' releases, they would have inhibited the creators from discussing their overall approach to the creation, acting, directing, writing, and production work that went into the entire epic film, as each commentary would have focused exclusively on either 'Part 1' or 'Part 2.'  Fans hear what it was like to tackle a a 2 and 1/2 hour animated film.  The creative efforts that went into this project were phenomenal, expensive, and unprecedented for the DCUAOM team.  This is a film that Warner Bros. Animation gave a high budget to and lost a significant amount of money on.  The total gross for both 'Parts 1' and '2' was less than 5 million dollars.  DCUAOMs used to gross 5 million PER TITLE, minimum.

The inclusion of a 70 minute Frank Miller documentary focused on the creation of the graphic novel itself is the type of bonus material the DCUAOMs have virtually never included.  Miller is notoriously 'tight-lipped' about his creations, and particularly, this historic graphic novel.  The fact the documentary includes extensive new interview footage with Miller makes it the definitive documentary of the book - one of the most important graphic novels ever written.

The carry-over of all bonus materials from the separately released 'Parts 1 & 2' is, of course, obligatory.  Many fans, though, will enjoy the 4 exclusive collector cards included in the set which will feature never before seen artwork.  Given the fact the graphic novel itself has seen various special anniversary, hard-cover and limited release editions, it seems perfect that the animated version is getting this treatment.

Kudos to Warner Bros. Home Video for taking a second chance on this title by giving it to fans in a format they really wanted it in, including a comprehensive NEW commentary track, and a 70 minute definitive documentary on Frank Miller and the Graphic Novel itself.  Given the low sales of the original releases, this might turn out to be another 'break-even' release for the division.  And, if that's the case, it's the fans who will end-up being the sole winners yet again.",1373846400,218,2987,5.04684317718941

5840222,5,B00DP9MDE4,"This 3 hour long animated film is based on the excellent graphic novel by Frank Miller. It stars a jaded, cynical, and brutal Batman who decides to return to fight crime in Gotham after retiring for several years. Along the way he goes up against the likes of Two Face, Joker, and of course, Superman.

What makes this film so extraordinary besides the stellar voice cast is that it truly provides an excellent insight into the psyche of Batman. It also has an epic score with an incredible main theme. The animation is also top notch with several standout scenes showing just how brutally effective the vigilante still is in his old age.

This is the story that Batman v Superman drew heavily on, so if you liked that interpretation of Batman, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Superman is also really well portrayed and has none of his self doubt issues from Dawn of Justice.

As the headline states, I truly believe this is the best Batman film ever made, animated or otherwise.",1517356800,3,985,4.649425287356322

5840227,4,B00DP9MDE4,"This set, itself, I could easily give five stars, as far as what comes with it--and for under twenty bucks!  This was a marvelous surprise!  I guess I didn't read the description carefully enough, when I hit the purchase key.  I thought I was simply buying a combo set of the two animated ""Dark Knight Returns"" movies, parts 1 and 2.  It wasn't until I received the package that I realized that the movies come with a hardcover copy of the famous Frank Miller GRAPHIC NOVEL, itself!  In fact, for a second, I thought I had somehow ordered the wrong thing or a mistake had been made--that I had somehow been sent the book instead of the movies.  Alas, I opened it up and tucked into the novel's cover was the movie blu-ray, a DVD, and a supplemental blu-ray of extra features--and the complete graphic novel.  What a pleasant surprise and keepsake.

Especially sense, before now, I had never taken the opportunity to read the novel.  Back in the day (the mid '80's), I recall seeing it on the store shelves, but to be honest, it didn't interest me at the time--mainly because this harder core, antihero Batman seemed so out of character with the more traditional, dare-I-say, kid friendly Batman I had grown up loving and admiring.  Batman was my favorite superhero, my favorite ""super friend"" - and I just wasn't interested in seeing him portrayed as a borderline villainous, madman.  And you could say, to a degree, that criticism still applies.  Despite how much the Frank Miller interpretation of Batman has influenced virtually all modern incarnations of Batman ever since (and there's no denying that), it doesn't change the fact that, even now, no matter how dark the story may be, Batman is still--usually--portrayed as more hero than antihero.  Whereas, to this day, Miller's Batman still feels somehow...off.  Out of character.  Which is ironic given its widespread influence.  But that in itself is reason enough to go back after all these years and give it a second look from a more matured perspective and appreciation--to see how it compares to the rest of Batman's multiverse tapestry.

So, like I said, five stars for the set itself--the ability to virtually read along and compare the movie to the novel is wonderful--and the movie(s) do indeed follow the novel extremely faithfully.  Well done.  Where I feel the need to dock it one star is the content of the story itself.  Yes, it's good.  It's fine.  But does it live up to all the hype?  Was I blown away by it?  Was it really all that revolutionary even for the time?  Well, besides making Batman absolutely bats**t insane and Superman into a full-of-himself glory hound (completely out of character in both cases), the plot itself is actually fairly average, even for the time--particularly in the first half, which is a pretty decent and typical Batman caper involving Two-Face.  The second half, I suppose you could say was more ""revolutionary"" because (spoiler alert) it pitted two of DC's most iconic heroes, Batman and Superman, against each other.  Remember that big DC movie, ""Batman v. Superman,"" everyone claims they hated?  Well, guess what?  (Spoiler alert)...That movie you say you hate, the one you say is too dark and out of character?  That movie *is* Part 2 of ""The Dark Knight Returns.""  So, if you hated that movie, you're not going to like this Miller story much better.  In fact, the only major difference between the two is that Superman and Batman's roles are reversed.  In the Miller version, Batman is being (hypocritically) hunted by Superman for being too much of a vigilante, instead of the BvS version in which Batman, a mere mortal, is concerned about a god-like alien with way too much power (which actually makes more logical sense than the Miller version).  So, to me, it seems like a bit of a disconnect to declare BvS terrible, while declaring ""The Dark Knight Returns"" awesome.  That said, unless I missed it, I don't recall anyone in the Miller version yelling out ""Martha!""  So, there is that.

However, beyond all the dark portrayals of traditionally heroic characters, the Frank Miller novel exists as a piece of blatant political satire that in many ways hasn't aged very well.  Within its pages, Ronald Reagan is not only president, he is a major character in the story--portrayed in much the same way as he was portrayed in many newspaper editorial cartoons of the time--that of a buffoonish, warmonger marching us right into nuclear annihilation.  Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or Independent, I think any *reasonable*-minded person would agree that history has proven that such caricatures of Reagan were not only unfair, but indeed the opposite was true.  Sure, mistakes were made.  Reagan: Iran-Contra; Kennedy: Bay of Pigs.  But just as when Kennedy had stood up to Khrushchev, Reagan was haunted by the prospects of nuclear war and worked with Gorbachev--challenged Gorbachev--to tear down that wall.  It came down without a shot being fired between the two superpowers.  By contrast, Miller portrays Reagan as a villainous moron who gleefully sends us into open warfare with the Soviet Union over a fictional stand-in for Nicaragua (with Superman as our primary super-weapon), while pausing to order Superman to hunt down and *kill* Batman (because obviously that's what that evil villain, Ronald Reagan, would do).  Then again, to be fair, Reagan is no more out of character in this story than Batman or Superman, so we can chalk it up to some weird alternative universe along the lines of Star Trek's ""Mirror, Mirror.""  If Miller had just given Superman a goatee, I could call it brilliant.

The animated films, while very true to the novel, do somewhat tone down the novel's cartoonish portrayal of both Reagan and Superman (although not a lot), but it most definitely tones down the novel's insane portrayal of Batman.  The Bruce Wayne/Batman of these two animated films is actually not too far off from the universe of The Animated Series, most specifically Batman Beyond.  That stands to reason as it's made by the same producers.  Replace this new female Robin with Terry McGinnis and you basically *have* Batman Beyond--or maybe, more accurately, a prequel to Batman Beyond.  A slightly different ending and set in a different decade, it could almost fit in continuity with it.  In that regards, it's an enjoyable watch.  The film's artwork, while closely mirroring the panels of the Miller novel, is beautiful and much cleaner and sharper than the novel's artwork which ranges from okay to downright sloppy and unattractive.  However, the oddest part is these two animated films contain both nudity and extreme graphic violence, and yet manage to garner a PG-13, while ""The Killing Joke"" which didn't even come close to this kind graphic content is rated R.  Go figure.  If I were cynical, I might think that MPAA ratings were more related to marketing than actual content advisory.

All in all, this is a very nice set to own and an interesting study of the franchise's history.  Despite its faults, I do recommend it.",1512604800,,7058,4.903035413153457

This film is epic, basically and older Bruce Wayne has had it with crime going up, so he becomes Batman once again to save Gotham. Without spoiling too much, it's dark gritty, has some great commentary on politics and even the prison system...it shows how either extreme winning in the cold war could mean nuclear annihilation, and many of the former Mutant gang members reform themselves as the ""Sons of Batman."" Also shows Batman's ingenuity, with no superpowers, he can stil hold his own against Superman.

5840242,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Staying very true to the comicbook of when Batman and Superman duked it out (And not throwing all cards on the table like a certain zack snyder)

I guess some die-hard fans would feel a bit put off by some of the actions Batman takes during this movie but, keep in mind this takes place long after Justice League, so far after that batman is in retirement.
I personally feel a bit mixed with DC feeling they need to make everything ridiculously dark and 'edgy' but in this movie's case it's done in a good way and you can get more involved in the action and be a bit more uncertain on how things will turn out since it takes place after the DC heroes glory days.

If you're after some good batman action not seen since Nolan's batman trillogy this is one movie you should put on your bucketlist.",1496534400,,795,4.293333333333333

I did not read the comic, but this is by far the best batman movie I've ever seen (if you've seen anything that tops this then please leave a comment - I want to watch it). ""Year One"" was interesting, and more about Jim Gordon. These two movies (which don't break in between) were, together, the best batman movies I'd ever seen. He's not a clean cut superhero, but he does what he has to do. He's clever, witty, ingenious - just perfect. SPOILER ALERT : The Arrow makes an appearance, and so does the Joker. Watch this one through. It will make you wonder why these few animated DC gems aren't the ones released into theaters, and the terrible live action ones are. It wasn't perfect, but for those of you who have somewhat kept up with the Batman's story (like myself) will find this movie to be a sort of closure to his legacy. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope you will too. This puts the new dc 52 movies to shame.

It seems this is the 30th anniversary edition of the dark Knight returns along with the deluxe edition of the movie on blu ray and dvd which I find to be a great deal for around 20 bucks. I have not read or looked at the 30th anniversary comic book but I understand that it comes with a new introduction by Frank Miller and the guy who is working on the dark Knight 3 with miller. I think his name is Brian azerrello. I'm not sure if I spelt his name right. Sorry. I really want to get this just for the introduction alone because I really just would like to hear Frank Miller talk more about the dark Knight returns. I already own the movie. It is fantastic and a faithful adaptation to the book. So to get the book and the movie together for anyone who doesn't own either at this price is spectacular.,1478822400,,1059,4.196078431372549

The incorporation of the news clips was brilliantly done and the characters really shine.

My only issue is the loss of so much internal dialogue that really helps shape an aging Bruce Wayne's character in the comic. Besides this one thing, it is an superb movie, and one I definitely recommend to any new budding Batman fans.",1474502400,,531,4.474226804123711

5840291,3,B00DP9MDE4,"Frank Miller's seminal graphic novel THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is a brilliant story-- not just a brilliant Batman story or a comic book story-- it can stand with anything sitting with literature on a library bookshelf.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this adaption which disappoints right from the very beginning.  There are so many great lines in the graphic novel that are watered down and re-written here for no reason other than to spoon feed what we're seeing.

In the book- there's a great exchange between Jim Gordon and his friend Bruce Wayne which goes something like this:

""To Batman, I'm glad he survived retirement.""  The glasses tink together.
""He didn't,"" Bruce responds ""But Bruce Wayne is alive and well.""
""Well, he's certainly learned to drink.  Spoken to Dick lately?""
""Not in 7 years, you know that Jim.  Let's call it a night.""

Look at that-- it's brilliant dialogue that moves the story along at a fast paced clip.  Compare it to what's done here and the dialogue is done in that awful ""let's sum things up for the viewers manner"".  Gordon has to sit and explain to Bruce (and us) that Batman wouldn't be accepted today, that crime is out of control, that the Mutant gang is worse than anything Batman ever faced-- all facts we LEARN in the graphic novel by seeing evidence of it-- so why sum it up so early in the film?

The film makers also opted to leave out the first person narration from the book, which is understandable but regrettable.  Some of the best lines in the book are ones Bruce/Batman delivers in his thoughts and we lose those here.

The worst offense is the storyboarding-- the choices for shots for many of these are just bad anime compositions-- Miller did perfect storyboards in the book and adapting those would have been much more successful.

In the book the race car scene which opens the story is handled in an abstract way so that we aren't really sure what's happening while here it's spelled out for us so blatantly as to make it bland and uninteresting.

It's a terrific book, this is a mediocre adaption.",1472083200,,2061,4.623626373626373

5840294,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Holy s---! This movie was awesome. With the new Batman versus Superman movie coming out on Blu-ray there has also been other Batman and DC films available at local stores. I actually bought the graphic novel/DVD/Blu-ray combo for only $20. I am by no means a comic book type person. The only DC animated movie I ever saw before this was superman doomsday, which wasn't bad but still felt like it was aimed at a younger crowd. I heard rave reviews about this graphic novel for the longest time and heard that some of the Batman v superman was inspired by this story. I do have to say I enjoyed Batman V Superman. It wasn't the clunker that everyone seem to think it was. Fans had a much more favorable reviews than the critics did. Same thing with man of steel. I enjoyed it but it wasn't fantastic. However there were still a lot of things I felt that could've done differently. I bought this on a whim thinking I would give an animated movie a chance. And I'm glad I did.

Besides the Christopher Nolan trilogy this has got to be the best Batman movie. In all seriousness I wonder why they haven't just made this into a live action movie. They borrowed parts of it for the Batman V Superman movie such as Batmans iron suit and whatnot and the fight scenes between Batman and Superman but a full live adaptation of this movie would be awesome.

One complaint about DC movies is that they are too dark. I really don't mind this. I think it's a good contrast to marvels campy fun.  This movie is fantastic because it is dark, graphic, bloody, and violent. I watched the R-rated ultimate edition of Batman V superman after watching the theatrical cut. It is a much better coherent story overall but I only think they gave it an R rating to show that they can be edgy just like Deadpool was. It really wasn't that much graphic or bloodier. In fact this animated movie and others from the DC animated series I've watched after this one are much bloodier and violent. So parents be warned just because it is animated and PG-13 rated does not mean it is for little kids. I would feel much more comfortable having a small child to watch the R rated version of Batman V superman before I let them watch this one. And that's not a complaint, just a heads up to parents.

I think because this adaptation of the graphic novel is faithful that's what makes it great. It needs to be dark and needs to be somewhat Grim because that's what the story is. After watching this one I watched Batman year one, the killing joke, under the red hood, and the same thing could be said for them: they are violent, dark,graphic, and grim. All are animated but also the storytelling is fantastic. wake up DC and Warner Bros. and take a hint from your animated universe. Storyline comes first!",1471392000,,2764,4.424361493123772

The aged Bruce Wayne/Batman idea was interesting and I liked the ultra violent Batman that came with it. Was expecting a more adult cartoon with a more interesting story and more realistic characters. None of the voices seemed to fit the characters, even if they are aged versions of them. Certain things just don't make sense like how Alfred would still be alive when Bruce is pushing 70 and why the hell the jokers therapist or the mental institution would allow him to go on a talk show or why the talk show would allow him. The girl who became Robin automatically knew how to fight and do acrobatics across the city as soon as she put the suit on. They never explain how she could do those things so suddenly.

I took off one star, because the image appears to be a box containing all of these items, and I was under the impression there would be a comic and a standard blu-ray case, containing the discs, separately.  The discs are stored within the back cover of the comic, which might be fine for some people, but most people I know keep their movies and comics in different places.  Another concern is that there are 3 discs, but only two spots within the cover, so one disc remains in a slip-sleeve, with no manner to attach to the rest.

The contents are outstanding, do not get me wrong.  The comic is sharp and colorful, the discs are high quality, but the packaging was poor planning.  In the event you wish to lend the discs OR the comic to a friend, you have to trust them with both, as well as the loose extras disc..

I'm extremely happy to have everything related to TDKRe in my collection, but to do it again, I'd probably purchase the comic and deluxe blu-ray separately.",1459900800,8,1127,4.389423076923077

5840381,4,B00DP9MDE4,"I am a fan of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" so I am a little prejudice.  Maybe I am not quite remembering right, but I thought this was the closest adaptation to a comic book that I have ever seen (including the style of the characters)

Pros...
I think it might be the Whole story
Interesting concept (older Batman), new surprise Robin,
complex but understandable

Cons...
It is long (if you don't like that)
Not for children

Overall, I can recommend this as a true ""Batman"" story",1455840000,,478,4.523255813953488

I am impressed with the overall way the comic was adapted but I find it amusing that they took out all the smoking.  Gordon in chewing nicotine gum.  All in all a good film and a reason to re-read the original comic.  If you want to see the basis for Batman v Superman fight look here!,1455753600,,549,4.190476190476191

If you've never read the comic book series, this animated adaptation is a very good source to get you up to speed. The fighting scenes are great, and Batman's ferocity in dealing with the criminal element are well depicted. Definitely not the Saturday morning cartoon or the classic 90's Batman: The Animated Series. This movie is pretty graphic, violent, and gritty.

Voice Acting is very good. Commissioner Gordon's actor is flawless, Batman's is what you'd expect for an old Bruce Wayne, but a still powerful voice. I was disappointed Mark Hamill was not the Joker, his replacement isn't all that great but he's ok. The rest are on par. The music is one the best soundtracks in a movie.

Speaking of, the direction is outstanding and the art style replicates that of the source material but never feels derivative to the point where you feel like you've seen it before. It takes the best stylistic elements and gives applies them masterfully to animation. Biting social commentary, brutal action and voice acting of the highest quality leave one wondering; does it get any better than this?

5840437,2,B00DP9MDE4,"Cannot recommend,
I watched the movie/graphic novel and then watched it again to think about my first impressions on it.  Many people are calling it a Masterpiece, but there are problems which make me unable to recommend seeing it.  First, I am not a Frank Miller fan and those who are will love it, but if you are not don't buy.  I may draw angry responses for this but here it goes.
The first problem is the new Robin.  Let me say I have no problem with the new Robin being a girl.  (It may be not PC to say girl, but she looked thirteen or fourteen so I will say girl).  If she had a been a version of the DC character Huntress, and then she would have fit in.  But she was more of a groupie to Batman rather than a sidekick.  In the first two Robins one can see, in their backgrounds, why they followed Batman.  The new Robin seen to follows Batman because he saves her from being mugged and she becomes a groupie.  A female Robin would have to be more like the Huntress with a background to match to truly be the new Robin.  The new Robin wears no mask and could be picked out of a crowd in a second, and she looks to be too young to drive, but after a little training is flying a helicopter and driving the Batmobile.  Her parents are heard, not seen, and have no problem with her hanging out with a much older man who is not married.  My guess is that anyone else parents would at least want to meet her new friend.  But really, every man today has to be careful of taking a too serious interest in young children/young girls.  Better to keep Robin an orphan and male. The most troubling thing is what Batman calls her.  A soldier.  This did give me a pause.  The Batman I grew up with would not say that.  Child soldiers?
Second, there is a problem with Frank Miller using Ronald Reagan as the President.  Another reviewer calls this biting social commentary (albeit from 1985).  To be fair I am not a Reagan fan but the movie becomes more of a cartoon with this character because the President is a cartoon figure.
Most importantly in any there are many issues that Batman deals with.  One is the nature of crime, its true nature and the issue of Batman as vigilante.  James Bond may have a license to kill but at least he has to answer to someone.  This Batman answers to no one.  He not the worlds greatest detective, but someone who takes out his anger by fighting.  In many Batman features Batman spends time at the computer analyzing data, but not here.  In the Christopher Nolan movies Bruce Wayne becomes Batman because there is a social order breakdown.  The police and government are corrupt.  That is the reason the Batman is created.  It is in a society cant deal with the crime that the vigilante is created.  Near the end of the movie Batman said to Superman he existed because he does what is needed.  In the Nolan movies Bruce Wayne is waiting or wanting not to be needed.  That society can function with its problems without him.
There is also importantly the issue of who has the right to use force.  As I said before James Bond 007 does have a license to kill, but the State has given it to him to use only as needed and he has to report or to answer to someone when he does use it.  The same with Dirty Harry.  Society today has issues with the Tavon Martin stand your ground law.  The use of force is something which should be an issue.  Near the end when the power goes down Batman using the mob to seize power.  He may save the city, but it still is mob rule. Who elected him, the mayor is nowhere.  Which brings me back to child soldiers.  The followers of Batman are the young , but are a force of young people looking for a leader, in which Batman becomes their cult leader and they his soldiers.  This may be OK in Frank Miller mind, but it is not the true Batman.
There are many things I did like about the feature.  The feature on Bob Kane was very good.  The fact that the Joker was shown as a person who did what he did because not because of what society did to him, but because he wanted to do it.
But on the whole I can not recommend.",1442275200,,4076,4.190476190476191

5840451,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Very true to the Dark Knight Returns graphic novel by Frank Miller.  In my opinion, his best work.  The animation is true to the graphic novel as is the story.  Even better are the ""Behind the Scenes"" extras at the end with a history of the story.

Batman is without argument one of the most iconic characters in comics.  Even then some animated features and films really screw up.  This is NOT such a case.  I don't like to give away films in my reviews especially endings... but if you have read the graphic novel you know sort of what to expect.  So many films inspired by this graphic novel miss a lot especially at the end and this does not.

If you enjoyed the Dark Knight Returns graphic novel you will love this.  My Wife had not read the graphic novel when we watched this and she really liked it.  She also felt the behind the scenes was really excellent and well done.",1439164800,,879,4.298780487804878
5840452,4,B00DP9MDE4,"While I'm not the biggest fan of part 2 in the story. The animated adaptation of Frank Miller's work stays true to the story and Peter Weller's voice portrayal of the aged Batman is very well done.
My only beef is with part 2...SPOILER- The first part of the Dark Knight Returns is great as a retired Batman can't sit idly as a mutant gang terrorizes a helpless Gotham and Twoface resurfaces as well. It does an excellent job of portraying Batman using his psychological and resourceful strategies to not only defeat a more powerful foe but to also completely breakdown the enemy gang. The 2nd half features the much debated showdown between The Dark Knight & The Man of Steel. To me they just tried to raise the bar too high. Earlier in the story the return of Batman triggers a renewed interest from the Joker who comes out of a catatonic state & immediately starts wrecking havoc everywhere. While this is going on Superman is now basically a hired gun for the President wiping out the Russian Army & apparently ""disarming"" Oliver Queen in the literal sense.
While Batman barely defeats the Joker (snapping his neck no less) and only after he's killed masses of people including cops, civilians and a congressman... Batman is also being hounded by the police in full force barely escaping with his life. However in no time at all he's got a master plan to take on Superman & the U.S. army... Which more of less goes according to plan for him. To me it was just too much overkill in trying to prove how great Batman is while belittling too many others in the process.",1439078400,,1569,4.5477031802120145

5840458,4,B00DP9MDE4,"I watched this alongside reading the book and I can confirm that the movie did an excellent job - not only of translating it to the big screen, but in elaborating on some of the parts that were unclear in the book. While a classic entry into the Bat saga, it's not perfect. I found that the art left some things confusing and i didn't know exactly what happened. The movie can't really cut corners like that so they either had to interpret the pages or flesh them out and i think they did a wonderful job.

My slight issue with the movie is that the voice acting is a bit off. I can understand why they didn't use Kevin Conroy but I'm not sure that Peter Weller was a great choice, and I feel that way about a lot of the cast actually. And aside from voice acting, some of the story is a bit too goofy for my taste but these are issues i also have with the book and seem to be a staple of Frank Miller. But those small things aside, the animation is great and any fan of the bat will enjoy it.",1438214400,,993,4.015151515151516

This is one of the darker story lines from the Dark Knight with him just not messing around anymore.

Watch this movie, show this to your kids if you want to show them something Batman. Read the original story to see what they didn't do.
Overall, fantastic.",1437177600,,614,4.482142857142857
5840467,5,B00DP9MDE4,"NOT FOR KIDS!!! But definitely for every teen or adult Bat-fan.
After watching the movie, and then straight to the documentary afterwards, it becomes exceptionally clear the movie followed the novel nearly scene-for-scene. And while not all the book's dialogue is in the film (how would you animate a thought bubble?), all the film's dialogue comes straight from the book. The fates of some of the Batman's more prominent antagonists was well written, well filmed, and thankfully somewhat bloody considering the heinous crimes committed by most of them. No catsuit for Selena Kyle, that's for sure.

These books reinvented the comic genre for a good reason, and the film reflects this with style. The nature of current local crime, the permanent psychological damage of Harvey Dent, the flat-out psychopathic nature of the Joker...issues the Batman would have really faced in a real world. And the upcoming Batman v. Superman movie definitely follows the vein launched by Frank Miller. Add a biting social commentary (albeit from 1986), and this story arc is easily one of the best in a storied history.

The vocal cast is hard to judge. Peter Weller does a fine job as a rather cranky and grizzled Dark Knight...but I've been spoiled by Kevin Conroy for over twenty years through various series, movies and games; bias is hard to overcome. Michael Emerson's is passable (especially during some more...colorful activities), but I've again been spoiled by Mark Hamill for too long to be neutral. David Selby (Commissioner Gordon) has a horrible delivery for his first few lines, but gets quickly into gear as the film progresses, and Alfred is ably played by Michael Jackson (no, not that one).

Frank Miller's injection of realism in the Batman franchise cannot be overstated, and every drop of blood-soaked reality is reflected in the film almost perfectly. Everyone from Tim Burton to Christopher Nolan to Ben Affleck owe a huge debt to Miller's vision, as does every major comic title and movie since 1986. If you've been a Bat-fan at all in the last twenty years in any iteration presented, you need to watch this.",1437091200,,2118,5.011363636363637

5840470,5,B00DP9MDE4,"A lot of people thought the idea of doing an adaptation of Frank Miller's gamechanging 80s mini-series The Dark Knight Returns was nearly impossible, but the DC Universe crew decided to test the waters with Batman: Year One which met with a lot of success. This lead to them producing the ""What If"" story of Batman's future into two parts, which was later released as a single full-length compilation. The comic itself was only four issues long, but the content involved went on to influence several future productions, including Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. So, Bruce Timm and company treated it very seriously in creating a mature realized version of Frank Miller's story.

 Set in the undetermined future, Bruce Wayne hung up his cape a decade ago after the death of the second Robin(and this was still a few years before they actually did it in the comics!). In that time, Gotham has been overrun with a gang called the Mutants, who don't have any actual X-Factor but still are a big pain in the city's backside. Harvey Dent has allegedly been cured of his Two-Face persona with plastic surgery to fix his looks, but instead plans to blow up a few buildings. After getting frustrated with all the crime going on, Bruce heads back to the Batpoles to stop Two-Face. This causes a huge public outcry, with a lot of commentary being shown on TV as it provides a large part of the story's narrative. Batman then takes on the Mutant Leader, along with his new recruit, a teenage girl named Carrie who becomes the new Robin(and the first female ""Boy Wonder""). With the Mutants disassembled, a lot of the disenfranchised punks become vigilantes calling themselves the Sons of Batman. All this new Bat-buzz flying around causes the Joker to come out of a long state of catatonia, and remarkably gets booked on a late-night talk show where he unleashes his Joker toxin killing hundreds. Batman and Robin track Joker to an amusement park, and the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince have a final showdown, leaving the police to believe that Batman had killed Joker. Meanwhile, Superman has been in the pocket of the American government working as their secret weapon in order to keep them out of the lives of other superheroes. The Man of Steel stops a Russian invasion of a small Central American nation, but they counterattack with a nuclear warhead. Superman stops it, but it causes a nationwide blackout, and also reduces Supes' power since there is a nuclear cloud covering the sun. Batman pulls together the Sons of Batman into pulling together the chaos in Gotham after the blackout, which embarrasses the U.S. government, so the President sends Superman out to put down this ""outlaw"". Batman suits up in some heavy duty battle armor, and uses the entire Gotham power supply to take on this slightly weaker Superman, and tops it off with a Kryptonite arrow fired by a one-armed Green Arrow who also had an axe to grind with Clark. Batman then fakes his own death to make Superman and the government think that he is dead, while he along with Green Arrow, Robin, and the remnants of the Mutants and Sons of Batman to set up a new underground crimefighting crew.

This was a very faithful take on the original comic, with a few added extras, like some flashbacks of Bruce Wayne's parents, plus some bonus material with the social media coverage. The movie had an impressive cast with Robocop himself, Peter Weller as Batman, and Michael Emerson as a truly wild Joker, along with Mara Canals Barrera(formerly Hawkgirl on Justice League)as the new police commissioner. The style and animation match Frank Miller's vision of the comic perfectly, as well as an impressive musical score. If you've never read the comic before, and still want to know where a lot of the ideas for the previous live-action trilogy came from, you owe it to yourself as a true Bat-fan to check this out!",1436832000,,3884,4.776785714285714

5840485,4,B00DP9MDE4,"Very smart take on the Batman.  What will he do when he is ""old""?  When society rejects the super heroes?  When, as in real life TODAY, the politicians allow criminals to infect and run major cities?  And when Superman is the self-righteous lapdog of the presidency?

Very cool, suspenseful set of movies.  Lots of tension as the older, wiser, but weaker Batman chooses to do what's right.  He is frequently outmatched, but never gives up.  He is frequently betrayed, but never backs down.  Society is maybe not worth the Batman, but this hero does not care.  And a new Robin pops up to boot!  Pretty cool sidekick, although her backstory is pretty much ignored.

The action is excellent, adult, and creative.  The evil is very evil.  This ain't yo mamma's Joker.  So, not for kids.

The acting almost perfect.  You will get drawn into this film set quickly and enjoy the experience.  Nothing corny.  It's a darker, more serious and intelligent take on Batman.

CONS?  Why the heck would he keep wearing the standard suit when he can obvious invent cloaking technology and a suit to fight Super Dud?  Some inconsistencies, but it's still a lot of fun to watch an incredibly vulnerable Batman take on all comers.",1434758400,,1211,4.721153846153846

What about the 600 people he had killed? Shouldn't he have gotten the death penalty? Everyone wants to kill Batman but not  Joker - seriously? The woman police commissioner has a vendetta against Batman but no back story explains why? Whoever wrote this mess had to be going through  a regimen of some serious meds, legal or otherwise.

5840495,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Having never seen the original graphic novel, I have to say I was highly impressed by this adaptation. It's three hours long of pure, compressed awesome as Batman makes a comeback in Gotham City with a vengeance. And while he is older, Batman has lost none of his skills and determination, settling old scores one by one.

Aside from strong action sequences, the movie also has some powerful themes running through it, particularly how it satirizes our media and way of life. Batman's activities and those of his enemies are commented on by a 24/7 news circus, led by a variety of talking heads that are all too often very opinionated but completely clueless. Far from dated, that commentary seems more relevant than ever. Today we live in a 24/7 news cycle, bombarded with information, but most of it's useless at best, misleading at worst.

Another theme is authority figures abdicating said authority by failing to act when it's needed. Only Batman is willing to make the hard choices that will keep other people safe and restore order, but unfortunately this, more than anything else, makes him public enemy #1. Is it appropriate to resort to vigilantism when our leaders fail us, or is it better to stand by them for the sake of public order? Batman seems to prefer the former, and it's hard to argue with the results.

The characters in the movie are all very interesting, with striking visual designs. The Mutants are a bunch of savages that babble slang from behind the multitudinous neon red glow of their visors, and led by a monstrous leader that probably is, in fact, a mutant. The Joker, in contrast to his usual lanky, disheveled appearance, looks nearly unphased by age and seems stronger than ever. There's Carrie, the girl Robin, who adds a desperately needed splash of bright color to Gotham's grim world, and her enthusiasm is infectious. And of course, there's the Batman, whose strong jaw and muscular bulk mark him as a force to be reckoned with. The voice-overs are all top-notch, too. The Joker's lines are delivered with an unnerving, almost feminine tone as he gleefully rampages about. Peter Weller's Batman is great, too. I know some people would want Kevin Conroy but Weller is just fine, here. This Batman needed to be someone who could come off as both a thinker and a leader, and Weller's strong voice pulled that off, though I have to admit that, when he said, ""I am the law!"" I couldn't help but get Robocop flashbacks.

It's not entirely perfect, though. While the animation is good, some of the special effects, especially fog or smoke, look cheap and out of place beside the animated characters. I also felt the movie was way too hard on ""President,"" who's obviously supposed to be Reagan--and the irony is that, while it was cool to poke fun at Reagan back then, these days, well after the publication of the original graphic novel, politicians from both parties are quick to try and compare themselves to him. So much for that bit of satire. And you may find this movie portrays some classic characters in ways you might be unused to, to say the least. Some scenes, especially with Superman and the Joker, are very disturbing, and I would even go so far as to say Heath Ledger's Joker was restrained compared to the one we have here.

The movie caps off with a few hours of documentaries, but while some of them are fairly interesting, they can be safely skipped, because otherwise you're looking at a five hour movie--geeze!

Hey, DC! How about a sequel, huh? Because The Dark Knight Strikes Again was... uh... well... hm. You know what, let's leave this saga at this satisfying conclusion. Frank Miller probably should have.",1433030400,13,3665,4.745682888540031

5840531,4,B00DP9MDE4,"I don't know if there's any kind of irony beyond me that DC continues to thrive in the animated field while Marvel falters, and vice versa. All I'm left wondering is why WB doesn't just let Bruce Timm produce their live action movies. Timm & Co. will never again reach the heights of the DCAU (1992 - 2006), but they still deliver quality animated stories. This is definitely their best since Doomsday and Under The Red Hood. If you like Batman epics, this is one of the best. While weaker, also check out the Year One movie.

There's still quite a few quality Batman stories for these guys to tell. The Killing Joke, The Long Halloween, Arkham Asylum... oh man. Imagine Arkham Asylum in animated form. Most expensive and involved DTV movie ever.",1429488000,,746,4.609022556390977

5840552,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I have been waiting for this to drop in price and when it was on a great sale locally I picked it up. I am a huge fan of Batman, but that doesn't mean I'll like and buy everything with his name on it. While a lot of the DC Animation Batman stuff has been pretty great (Gotham Knight, Year One) a lot more of it was quite terrible in my opinion (all the JLA movies, Assault on Arkham). I've seen all his movies and read the last 20 or so years of his comics (the current run by Scott Snyder is *awesome*) and this has always been on of the *best* Batman comic books ever written and created the modern, dark, psychological Batman that we all know and love.

Anyway, having said all that, I can say that I was not disappointing by this adaptation. It is very accurate and overall an amazing film. I'd go as far as to say it is one of the best Batman movies ever and easily better than Nolan's last Dark Knight Rises. I can't recommend this enough. This made me even more excited for the upcoming Batman V Superman movie (if it is anywhere near as good as the final act of this film, we're set).

The Deluxe edition also contains an excellent documentary on Frank Miller up to and including the creation of Dark Knight Returns which is arguably worth a standalone release itself. You also get a few other featurettes and some Batman: TAS episodes. Overall an excellent release. A+",1425081600,,1377,4.292307692307692

This is one such occasion and If I can help get the rating up, I'm all for it. This film beats out 99.9% of movies being released in theaters today and seriously should have been given a theatrical release. The voice acting, music, animation and story are all top notch. I've never read the original Frank Miller comics this film is based off of but those that have tell me they captured the story perfectly. Anyone and everyone that's interested in Batman, the psychosis that goes on in his head or his enemies needs to see this. Marvel is knocking home runs in live action while DC is absolutely crushing it in animation. What a great time to be a nerd!",1424822400,,789,4.486111111111111

Like Zack Synder's adaptation of Alan Moore's Watchmen this film takes place in an alternate Reagan era 80's that invokes what was happening back then in our country. The action is non stop as Batman returns to save his beloved city after a ten year retirement. Along the way he faces many enemies including a gang of socialist monsters that call themselves mutants, Two-Face, and a final battle with his arch nemesis The Joker. The most epic battle although is when the United States sends Superman to stop Batman. This is an amazing battle between these two heroes! The voice cast is great. Peter Weller is amazing as Batman its great that they got Robocop to play the dark knight. Michael Emerson (of Lost and Person of Interest) brings a new take of The Joker. It is hilarious Conan O'brian even cameos as a talk show host. The animation is phenomenal as it respects its source but also makes it its own. I really recommend this film to anyone who loves Batman and comics in general because it is a true masterpiece!",1412467200,,1297,4.594827586206897

The Dark Knight Returns is now in my top two favorite Batman adaptations ever made with The Dark Knight Rises. My father bought me the graphic novel at a thrift store months ago and I was up reading it until the early morning hours to finish it. I had heard some people rate this movie as the best film adaptation (live action or otherwise) of Batman ever made. I was skeptical  before I watched it. But now I agree. The stories in Dark Knight Returns are definitive for the characters they feature including Bruce Wayne and Batman. The film adaptation is very close to the novel. As the ending to Batman: Year One's beginning one can see parallels in Batman's motivations. It was beautiful to watch the novel come to life in HD.

As a comparison my Top 4 favorite Batman film adaptations:
1./2. The Dark Knight Rises/ The Dark Knight Returns
3. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm
4. The Dark Knight",1405728000,,1043,4.507936507936508

5840696,5,B00DP9MDE4,"DC really stepped up for this one. The Dark Knight returns is an animated version of the graphic novel that was released in the 80's. It turned Batman into a very dark character which stuck thruout the movies. The animation really matched the art in the comic very well, The voices were spot on and fit each character well. Nothing was held back here. Each time I was thinking during certain scenes,no they're not going to show it, each time I was wrong. It was nice having both movies together seamlessly and the extras were well worth the wait. I waited to get this cartoon as I figured they would combine them and I am glad I did. Very exciting to know the new Batman Superman movie will have the same feel as The Dark Knight Returns. If the movie is half as good as the cartoon we will be in for a treat as you will be with this movie when you purchase it. Thanks DC WB for a great job!",1405555200,3,890,4.180232558139535

This is a continuation of the Justice League group of characters that I never really liked. So it is not just Batman in Gotham City but Superman and the rest of the world. I thought the Reagan stuff was pretty de-legitimizing. Batman's voice is so awful and distracting I can not take the character seriously. He sounds like Dagget from the original series. And the story line is not very well thought out either. I think the worst thing about it is the character named Bruno, a para military lesbian complete with a full on butch haircut and no shirt. Seriously, she wears a swastika over each boob. 2nd to that the replacement for Commissioner Gordon is pretty much the same depressing character as Bruno, sans the swastikas. If I could I would ask for a refund but at least I only paid $10 instead of $15. If you have to see it I highly recommend that you rent it because you will probably won't want to watch it a 2nd time.

5840711,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I have a comic vlog on YouTube in which I discuss mostly each week's comic releases, but occasionally I throw in a subject video about this or that, and one that I felt that I was compelled to do was one about the year 1986, or as I call it, The Year That Changed Comics Forever. You had two major releases in the same year. One was Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' WATCHMEN, which for the first time, really introduced the deconstruction of the superhero to the comic book world, and holds the spot for the only comic book to be considered one of Time Magazine's Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century. The other was from a very popular writer/artist who had come from an extraordinary run on DAREDEVIL to DC Comics in 1985 with a strange and wonderful avant-garde fusion of a dystopian future blended with ancient Eastern mythology called RONIN. This still-young artist then, in 1986, decided to create a future vision of one of DC's most beloved and iconic characters that was brutal, dark, uncompromising and socially conscious. That man was Frank Miller, and that book that he created is one of the undisputed masterpieces in Comic Book history: BATMAN - THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.

THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS starts with a simple premise: It's the future, and it has been exactly ten years to the day that Gotham City and the world had their last sighting of Batman. And although it's not explicitly discussed, it is due to a few different things; the main reason being the implied death of a partner, and the other (and this is only an assumption) being that all of Batman's rogue's gallery as well as all elements of organized crime have either left Gotham, are behind bars or dead, or are in Arkham Asylum. So we have Bruce Wayne, a somewhat empty shell of a man trying his best to enjoy his retirement. We also have Commisioner Jim Gordon, facing his own mandatory retirement. The two are friends moreso than they ever were before because Gordon now knows that Bruce was Batman. This future is far from perfect though. The criminals of this era are products of a very new generation. They call themselves The Mutants, and they are not a gang of unruly kids; they are thrill-seeker killers that run around the city butchering children and nuns and anyone they want to show their depravity. Bruce, still a haunted man, and still very much an obsessive man, can no longer continue to ignore the threat they pose. And on a storm-toss'd night, suddenly The Batman reappears to wage his one-man war on crime.

Now, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is far more than that description. It is epic in its scale of emotional storytelling arcs and the amount of characters it has; it's epic in its battles; it's epic because it needs to be. A return of Batman after a 10-year absence requires something of such a grand scale that a mere 70-odd minutes would not be enough to contain it. So the adaptation by Bob Goodman and the direction by Jay Oliva smartly divided this into two segments and this film is Part One, which covers the first two chapters (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS; THE DARK KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT) of Miller's four-chapter tale. And sometime in 2013, we'll get Part Two. Unlike the previous Miller adaptation to be made by DC Animated, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, which was compact enough to be parsed into about 70 minutes of film, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is frankly too large for that.

Now, many of the less-than-or-moderately-positive reviews of this film from people who are fans of the source material are upset because they feel the film waters down so many of the elements of the savagery and biting social commentary that made the book into what it is. And I can totally understand and appreciate that point of view. There was stuff in the film that wasn't in the book and vice versa. There were lines of dialogue from the book I desperately wanted to hear the gruff voice of Peter Weller, playing Bruce Wayne/Batman, say on screen. But for the most part, they kept a great deal of the brutality in, like the scene with The Mayor and The Mutant Leader is the one that sticks out heaviest in my mind. There are moments of instantly recognizable panel composition from the book, including the immortal image of a silhouetted Batman brightly backlit by a lightning bolt. Much of the stylized street slang of the Mutants is present.

But film, live-action or animated, is a much different animal than comics. Comics can offer so many different styles of narrative. Such as internal monologue that you can read into the mind of your characters, giving you insight, and while that's great on the page, it can really hurt your momentum in a film. Oliva ignores almost all of the internal monologue, except for a pretty glaring scene in which he decides to use it. That moment is very important, but because we are treated to the internal monologue there, the viewer who is familiar with the source material wants more, leading to the aforementioned disconnect. It really proves the old chestnut of how you can please some people some of the time, but you can't please everyone all the time.

From a casting standpoint, Andrea Romano (who's been at this game for decades) assembles a list of great voice actors that are largely character actors that have appeared in some films and a lot of television. Weller is spot-on perfect. He has just enough of the world-weariness, but enough of the gravelly intonation that makes Batman a true bad@$$. David Selby, of shows like the original DARK SHADOWS and FALCON CREST, does an excellent job as the aging Gordon. Wade Williams, who has been in just about every television show from the 90's through today (and was even the Warden of Blackgate prison in Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) does a commendable job as the ""rehabilitated"" Harvey Dent. The real standouts here for me were young actress Ariel Winter as the voice of Carrie Kelley aka Robin and Michael McKean (THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and was even Perry White in TV's SMALLVILLE) as psychologist Bartholomew Wolper. Winter gives the youthful energy and strength that Carrie needs, and McKean gives the right air of pompous superiority as Wolper.

The animation style doesn't totally ape that of Miller, but it certainly shows its influence with its heavy use of almost cube-like faces and enormous hulking bodies that give the characters that even-larger-than-life aesthetic. Occasionally, in particular with vehicle sequences, the movement gets bogged down by CGI, which can be really jarring. But the fight and action choreography is very fluid and the big fights are very brutal.

DC Animated Films, under the auspices of mastermind Bruce Timm, have made quite a name for themselves since 1992, when BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES first premiered. That groundbreaking series made way for what is now considered the DC Animated Universe. They've recently been releasing a slew of nearly full-length animated films based on either some of the more famous characters or some extremely popular comic book story arcs, from characters like WONDER WOMAN and GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT or GREEN LANTERN: EMERALD KNIGHTS (which are not from a specific story arc) to SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE DOOM, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, THE NEW FRONTIER, and SUPERMAN VS. THE ELITE. These have worked to varying degrees of success, but THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE is one of the more successful attempts at bringing something to the screen that is something of an impossible undertaking. They know that there are legions of fans that consider DKR their ""Batman Bible"", and trying to please all of them by simply translating the book page-for-page would have been a disaster. You have to have enough surprising moments in the film that will keep the audience on its toes, or you might as well do a motion comic.

My main complaint with this film is that I don't know how successful it will be as a storytelling experience unless you're familiar with the source material. I think that there's too much included that, just from a style standpoint, is really going to be confusing for fresh eyes to see it. I have faith in the audience, but I think that the only reason that I'm giving this four instead of five stars is because I don't think that newcomers to this tale will be able to get as much out of it as they should because of its very faithful adaptation.

As it is, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE should please longtime fans of the comic, but might not appeal to the newer fans as much as the Nolan Batman films have been able to do.

Now, onto Part 2:

When I first heard that DC Animation was going to be doing what is, in essence, a feature-length animated film out of Frank Miller's historic DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I was a skeptic. After seeing what Warner Premiere and DC Animation did with Miller's arguably better work BATMAN: YEAR ONE (while being good, it is far from being where it needed to be, quality-wise), I was scared that they would excise too many of the great moments of social satire or cartoon down the violence so that it might be more palatable for a bigger audience.

Thankfully, under the perhaps more watchful eyes of director Jay Oliva and DC Animated's mastermind Bruce Timm, both Part 1 and Part 2 of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS are very successful at bringing the comic to animated life. However, Part 2 proved to be even more successful and dynamic of an adaptation than Part 1.

The film (as far as both parts are concerned) does benefit making a pretty clear delineation of chapter breaks in connection to its source material. The comic, in its original form, had four issues. Part 1 of TDKR has the first two; entitled ""The Dark Knight Returns"", showing the aged Bruce Wayne assuming the identity of Batman after a ten-year absence amongst the menace of a gang of sociopathic punks called The Mutants, and ""The Dark Knight Triumphant"", which shows Batman gaining a new Robin in young Carrie Kelley and the defeat of the Mutant's leader.

No matter how great those stories may be, it's all still a warm-up for Part 2, which has the real meat of the story as Batman must eventually confront The Joker (voiced by Michael Emerson), who has himself emerged from a 10-year catatonia simply as a response to Batman's return, and also, branded a public menace, he is facing arrest from Gotham City's new police commissioner Ellen Yindel (voiced by Maria Canals, best known to DC Animated fans as the voice of Hawkgirl in the JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoons) since Jim Gordon reached his mandatory retirement. And then, amidst an ever-changing and volatile political climate, Batman is put directly into the crosshairs of the President, who unleashes Batman's longtime frenemy Superman (voiced by Mark Valley) which will seal Batman's fate and the fate of Gotham City.

As with Part 1, the animation is done wonderfully, and has enough of Miller's giant physiques and Lynn Varley's darker coloring to give moments that seem to be lifted right off the page. But the voice of Peter Weller is still a bit of a problem. I felt that he would be perfect to cast as the older Batman/Bruce Wayne, but unfortunately, while not being monotone, there isn't enough emotion behind his voice during really any moment that gives any kind of indication that he feels one way or the other about the events at hand other than through dialogue. Although, it's the presence of Michael Emerson (best known as Benjamin Linus on LOST, or Harold Finch on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the voice of The Joker that ends up more than making up for any lack of passion. His Joker is so incredibly smarmy, viciously cruel, and more than a little love-struck. His personification of The Joker is that of less of a maniacal clown and more of a devilish seducer, waiting for the only person he's ever loved. It's here where one of the major points of Miller's work is seized brilliantly. Conceived not only as a story of Batman's older years, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is also a deconstruction of the characters portrayed within. The Joker exists because of Batman, and vice versa. They have a symbiotic relationship that far surpasses that of a superhero/supervillain conflict. They are almost interdependent upon each other, which is why The Joker is unable to kill Batman and why Batman, despite the sentiment he feels that he's murdered all of The Joker's victims himself, is also unable to end the omnipresent threat of The Joker with any real finality. Their final confrontation is brutal, extremely violent, and extremely unsettling.

The finale of the piece comes from a number of angles. A small Latin American country called Corto Maltese is being invaded by Soviet forces (bear in mind, this film takes place at the time that the comic was written in 1986), and while Superman helps to turn the tide of that conflict, the Soviets retaliate with an experimental nuclear weapon that has catastrophic effects for the United States. Gotham City needs a savior, and despite his injuries and being hunted by the law, Batman steps up to lead the city in saving itself. This leads in turn to the climactic confrontation between Batman and Superman. While the fight in the comic does hit the right moments, it's rather brief, and that is certainly not the case in this film. The epic battle between these two titans is extended to give a greater strength, a more visceral thrill, and perhaps even a more emotional punch than what was in the comic. It's by far the highlight of the film from every standpoint. The voice acting from Weller coalesces, and the animation of the fight in all of its superpowered glory is breathtaking. What really makes this scene work, though, is the incredible score provided by Christopher Drake, who has provided the score for just about all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far his most memorable and best work for this company.

As I stated in my review for the first of these two animated films, to adapt a work of such depth, nuance, and bravura was something I felt was an impossible task. And while THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS may not give the audience maybe everything it wants from the comic, it gives more than we would have expected, and in some cases, even enhances moments from the original material. This is a bold and mostly excellent adaptation of Miller's seminal work, and deserves to be counted amongst DC Animated's best work, particularly for Part 2. I couldn't really recommend this more highly.

As far as extras for the Blu-Ray release of this, it contains two segments regarding the characters; one about the history and rivalry between Batman and Superman and another more about the beginnings and the pathology of The Joker. These segments prove to be extremely well done with a cast of great talking heads such as Denny O'Neil, Grant Morrison, Jerry Robinson (who co-created The Joker), and Michael Uslan, who has been an executive producer of virtually every Batman film or television project since Tim Burton's 1989 film. It also includes a lengthy ""From Storyboard to Screen"" segment with commentary by Oliva, three episodes of Batman cartoons (two from the original 1990's animated series and one from the more recent BRAVE AND THE BOLD series) and a brief glimpse at a digital comic version of Miller's source material.

If you've seen some of the more recent DC Animated films, post Bruce Timm's departure and James Tucker now assuming his position, there is a frightening drop in quality in almost every aspect. THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS might be the last great DC Animated release unless they start to turn things around, and not let Geoff Johns become the go-to guy in the post-New 52 DC Animated Universe.",1402876800,2,15647,4.760781422779211

As a fan, though, I sometimes got bogged down in mixed ideological messages, as well as the overall mischaracterization of Superman.

The bottom line, though, is that this is likely the absolute best DC Comics adaptation that exists, because it keeps the story of the book very intact while also streamlining other elements of it. The cast is wonderful, the animation very evocative of Miller's art, and the writing largely uncompromising.

This is the definitive Batman story in my humble opinion.

This release solved that issue and the seamless story is nice to have. I was very happy to add this deluxe edition to my Batman movie collection.

Overall the picture quality doesn't disappoint and the audio was great. This is a nice looking animated feature, as the pages from the graphic novel look amazing coming to life in all their HD glory. All the sound effects and voice acting are well done too.

5840732,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I have not read the comic yet, but I most certainly will.  I understand the comments here about the film not measuring up - I felt the same way about the Superman animated feature, ""Doomsday"" because The Death of Superman was my favorite comic book growing up and to see it truncated to half an hour of screen time was disappointing.  I cannot speak to this film's characterization of the comic book, but there seems to be a consensus that it matches the plot but loses some of the subtlety (like every film adaptation ever created).

This movie may be 10 times worse than the comic, but it is the best Batman film I have ever seen.

The movies that most come close to this one are Under the Red Hood and the first two in the Dark Knight series.  The Tim Burton films were great in their own right, but they owe everything to Frank Miller, and this animated feature feels like a modern nostalgic nod to what Miller did for the Batman character.

The voice acting takes some getting used to.  I must say I would have cast this differently, but after a couple views, the dialogue sounds better.  There is no replacement for Mark Hamill as the animated Joker, but the Joker in TDKR is creepy to say the least.  Peter Weller (voice actor for Batman) suffers at times, especially during his speech to the Sons of Batman, but for the most part is able to do his fair share.

But in terms of the story, and I know that this film (like all post-Miller Batman films) owes everything to the source material, this film is amazing and well-executed.  I'm not going to remove stars simply because it is an adaptation - despite its flaws, this movie holds up, and despite its long-running time, is instantly re-watchable.  It is definitely for adults only - the animation is more brutal than any of the live-action films.  It is, however, much shorter than watching the Nolan films back to back, and as much as like Nolan's approach, this film succeeds in doing more in less time.  The film contains epic scene after epic scene, and manages to execute without feeling rushed.  There are many villains, but the film does not feel stifled by the ""too many characters"" cliche.

I would not recommend this film to children or anyone unfamiliar with the Batman story, and in fact would recommend watching Under the Red Hood before watching this film to better understand Batman's character in this movie.  It is not necessary, but I think my viewing experience was enriched because I had seen UTRH.

Is this the best possible Batman movie?  No, but I have yet to see a movie that tops it.  And I really enjoy just about every Batman movie that has come out since Burton introduced Michael Keaton - biggest exception being ""Batman & Robin.""",1400112000,,2720,4.546201232032854

Its about 2 and a half hours which is really long for an animated movie, and mainly features batman, a new robin, superman, and comishoner Gordon, with some other characters that play more minor roles being: selina kyle, the joker, and the mutant leader. Im not gonna explain any of the story because its way to long and in depth, so ill just say the story was pretty good. There weren't tons of action parts like in some other DC animated movies but the ones that there were were pretty awesome, theres a fight between superman and batman at one point and that was just epic.

An unquestionably excellent portrayal of Batman in the dark, brooding fashion that is beautifully complemented by the environments and prevailing tone and context of the story serves as the current apex of film adaptation of Batman as both a character and a franchise across animated and live action cinema.

The voice work of Peter Weller as Batman is both a stark contrast to Kevin Conroy's well-earned tenure as the incumbent voice of the Dark Knight as well as an appropriate manifestation of the older, more conflicted Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter-ego.

5840774,5,B00DP9MDE4,"From Bluray.com review: ""a more mature, grounded, relevant, and psychologically complex Batman story"".

I never read Frank Miller's comic back when it came out, but when I heard this film was being produced, I went ahead and researched the graphic novel.  The team did a great job in recreating key moments straight from the comic panels, beautifully animated.  I will say this animated film is even better than the comic at portraying an old warrior refusing to give up the battle.  There are some retcons I appreciated like the Batman-Robin fallout (Jason Todd's death rather than Batman being abusive to Dick Grayson) and Batman gunning down enemies (he doesn't kill in this).

The story, while controversial, is very dark and faithfully adapted to a motion picture.  The animation is stunning in HD, and the audio is spectacular.  I was fine with the voice casting; many wanted Conroy and Hamill (I would too!), but the actors chosen for this film fit the tone very well.  Christopher Drake's music is probably my favorite aspect of this film, his soundtrack is phenomenal (just look up the track ""See you... in hell"").

Deluxe set contains commentary by director Jay Oliva, writer Bob Goodman, and voice director Andrea Romano providing a complete and extremely informative dissection of the film.  There is also a new documentary involving interviews with Miller and other professionals in the comic industry.  All other bonus features from part I and II are included.

I'll be bold enough to say THIS is my definitive Batman film, and I've seen a decent majority: 1989, Nolan's trilogy, all animated Batman films (Mask of Phantasm, Subzero, Return of the Joker, Under the Red Hood, and Year One).  Yes, better than Nolan's Dark Knight and edges out Return of the Joker and Mask of Phantasm.",1393804800,,1797,4.969899665551839
5840775,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I've read the original bool by Frank Miller, and must say this is a great adaptation of the graphic novel. I was frustrated that this movie was originally released in two parts months apart, but am glad to have the deluxe edition. Also, DC was attempting to pull away from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil's voice acting, when this should have been the final film to use them. Their voice acting defined these characters as much as this book and film did.",1393200000,,450,4.5
5840776,5,B00DP9MDE4,Very well done all around. Like many reviews say: Better then a lot of the live action movies. Will watch many times!,1393027200,,117,4.363636363636363

5840778,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I highly recommend this film and want to point out some of the key positives without giving away the plot:
1. The animation quality is higher than previous DC animated movies. It is the best-looking DC animated movie since Mask of the Phantasm (it actually looks better). But besides that, the editing, use of shadows, and thoughtful camera angles give this movie the sense of being a ""real"" movie as opposed to merely being a long Saturday-morning cartoon. My 65 year old father said it best when he said ""I forgot I was watching animation."" That's a testament to the quality of the storytelling, voice-acting and the overall production value. Peter Weller (Robocop) deserves a lot of credit for playing an older Batman.
2. The running time for the Deluxe Edition is 2 hours. This means that the story is not rushed from one plot point to another. One of the big problems with other DC animated movies is that they are usually less than 75 minutes long, which makes them seem rushed and leaves me feeling cheated for paying full-price for half a movie. Dark Knight Returns takes its time and allows you to become invested in the story. A proper cinematic running time makes a huge difference and I sincerely wish Warner Brothers/DC would get the hint for future animated movies.
3. The soundtrack has an amazing 1980s action-movie vibe to go along with the 1980s setting as opposed to a canned, forgettable soundtrack like Under the Red Hood and Year One.
4. The story itself as shown in film might actually be better than Frank Miller's original as it is paced better.
If you are a Batman fan or an action movie fan, then this is a must-have item.",1392422400,39,1649,4.6506849315068495
5840779,4,B00DP9MDE4,"I have been a fan of Batman since the 1960's tv version and through every incarnation since.  One of the things I have enjoyed is sharing my love with my nephews through the years.  I didn't know a lot about this particular film but after reading reviews and getting a really great price, I had to see.  I got the DVD / Blu Ray and planned on giving the DVD version to my younger nephews.  Man am I glad I watched before giving to them.  I loved the story and the idea of an aging Batman and coming back into a world where he wasn't really a part of anymore.  BUT for an animation version this was darker than any of the Christopher Nolin films.

5840783,4,B00DP9MDE4,"I bought this because of the rave reviews that made me curious. I know about Batman, but I'm not a comic buff that knows every single trivia of the character. This is the story about Bruce Wayne in his senior years. He has retired as Batman. Commissioner Gordon is also retiring, being replaced with a younger woman that is against Batman's vigilante activities. Gotham is being overrun by the ""mutants."" The Joker became a vegetable as he lost his motivation without Batman.

The story started really great. It shows how Gotham is without Batman, how Bruce decided to return, and how an older Batman fight and try to cope with his age and being human. The story reached the climax with the return of the Joker, and Joker and Batman having the ultimate stand off. Everything is great so far as the show feels real, and you can feel that Batman is just a regular human, being injured here and there, stabbed, shot, bled, etc.

Then came Superman (and the US president that parodied Ronald Reagan). The political points are interesting, but Superman ruins the whole realism feel of the beginning of the movie. Batman seems to be ""prime"" again compared to the early half of the show. Also, I was left wanting some more explanation on what happened to Superman (that made him act the way he did), and the rest of the Justice League. I mean seriously, what actually happened to everybody? The appearance of Oliver Queen himself screams for some back story exposition. Things seem to be glossed over just so we get to see Batman fighting Superman. The fight with Superman itself seems ""silly."" Sure, it's an exciting fight, seeing the top DC heroes against each other. However, due to the realism feel of the first half of the movie, this fight just felt too cartoony.

As for the blu-ray, it comes with 2 blu-ray discs (1 the main movie, 1 for special features), and a DVD containing more special features. The digital code is for ultraviolet (redeemable via flixster). The special features contains quite a bit of the history behind the original comic, and episodes from some of the older cartoons.

I still enjoy the movie. The first half is really great. It carries that dark realism feel. The second half feels more like a standard super hero cartoon. I think it would've been better if they expanded a bit more to give the back story about the retirement of each of the heroes in the Justice League. Not sure if that's in the original comic though, so maybe they just followed the source material. Overall, still a great Batman movie.",1391558400,,2534,4.674887892376682

5840789,3,B00DP9MDE4,"The Dark Knight Returns is one of the best DCAU film adaptions to have been released since Bruce Timm began his direct to dvd film releases. I went out at got this film in its original form when it was two separate DVDs. So when I found out they were going to finally unite the two films into one and give us a ton of new special features along with the one already featured on both DVDs I was both excited and disappointed.

I had said when the first part came out that this should have been one whole film and shown on the big screen, even if it was just a limited engagement. Yet, when I finally saw it... I felt that something was missing. Then I figured out that it was the anticipation and excitement that you got when the first part ends and you can't wait to get to the second dvd. The film just keeps going and it feels like it just drags. I don't know why, but when I watch these two parts separately, I find the whole story to be better paced and the whole first part doesn't get lost and forgotten thanks to Batman's two major showdowns with Joker and Superman. I also feel that if they would have not split this film into two separate releases I would have been much more satisfied. The special features, especially the documentary with Frank Miller is great, but because of its length, I didn't see myself wanting to watch it again and same goes for the documentary on Carrie Kelly and The Joker. Also, the sneak peaks of The Dark Knight Part 2 and Superman Unbound are not in this massive dvd/blu ray set. As a fan of the DCAU films I always anticipate seeing what the next project will be. I love the interviews and the story behind the decision to make the next film. Of course I am only stating this because I had seen the two sneak peaks and loved them.

The choice is yours when it comes to taking this complete edition over the two parts. I for one bought it and gave it to a good friend of mine free of charge. For the time being I will count my blessings and find comfort in Parts 1 & 2 and anticipate the release of Justice League:War. I just hope for future projects that involve a larger story, like Crisis On Infinite Earths or Kingdom Come, that they choose to release the whole story as one rather than split it down the middle.",1390694400,,2257,4.222222222222222
5840790,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Both the film and the special features are exceptional.  The Feature is, of course, an adaption of the graphic novel that literally shaped the modern Batman.  Both the Burtons films and The Animated Series drew from the more serious tone Miller gave this, at the time, unrelatable super hero and became the cornerstone of our modern Batman.
This edition includes directly related extras and also a feature-length look at Frank Miller and how he went from a 17 yr old Vermonter on to reshape how many of us would look at comics.
The second disc of extras (technically disc 1, actually) has five bonus cartoons.  And boy, they know how to choose them.  One episode is the Brave and the Bold which features Superman being exposed to Red Kryptonite.  Its riddled with little 'easter eggs' in the dialogue and has many characters from the Golden Age Superman (im not sure if the show itself is like that, ive only seen a couple episodes).
The other four are from Batman the Animated Series.  The Last Laugh (one of the Joker episodes, which are never bad), The Man Who Killed Batman (appropriately one of the Nostalgia Critics Top 11 episodes from the series) and finally the two parter Two-Face (easily one of the series best story arcs).

I was not expecting the amount of extras they included here and not one of them felt like 'filler'.  They were all interesting and the Batman cartoons are extremely well picked.

5840793,2,B00DP9MDE4,"I was extremely excited for this movie. From what i'd heard from friends and internet reviewers alike, this movie was supposed to be awesome. Instead, it was completely over hyped and lame. Now i have never read the two comic books, but i shouldn't have to to be able to enjoy a movie. I watched it with my sister and we were expecting good things since we both watched and loved Batman: Under The Redhood, wich i highly reccomend, and yet we constantly laughed at the dialogue, story, and overall seriousness of the movie, all these things just made it lame. The stroy was predictable the characters were dull and it had no flow. While just bearly watching the first part of the movie i kept hoping it would get better by the second part, it did not. Batman on a horse? Superman getting struck by lightning  and then sucking the life out of flowers to regenerate? The new commishiner who shoots at everything she sees? The Joker cracking his neck? Flying dolls? Batman retireing to teach murderers to be just like him? This movie was almost as bad as Batman: Year One the animated movie. Old time Batman fans will probably enjoy as it is a homage to one of the greatest Batman stories of all time, but its epicness just doesn't live up on screen. Hardcore fans probably own a copy already, but if you are really interseted, i suggest renting and watching this movie while you are drunk. Loved the four collecters cards though, and for that it gets 2/5 stars. I hope Batman: Assualt on Arkham and Son of the Batman will be better...",1390262400,2,1532,4.510791366906475

This is a dark, brutal, bloody, saddening film. And I love every frame of it. Everything hits just the right mark, the character designs, voice acting, writing, pacing is great. Peter Weller is fantastic as this broken-down, angry, sad portrayal of Batman, he seems somewhat monotone or unemotional at first, but as you let it sink in, it really fits like a glove. The Joker is also re-imagined, he's not that funny anymore, he's purely a psychopath. He enjoys what he's doing, but there's no lingering for a punchline, it's just him shooting people and laughing about it. The movie is only half the package here, though, the extra features are fantastic as well. There's a brand-new documentary on Frank Miller and the creation of The Dark Knight Returns comic, it goes over everything from how he first got into comics, his writing style, and the artwork.

I had never read a comic book before that moved me so much that it made me revisit my hobby of comic collecting at least for a short time until I realised that comic-book writing like this is a one-off and that the vast majority of what was out there at the time still didn't come close to Miller's masterpiece.  I just couldn't believe that comics had grown up so much just like I had done from what I remembered reading when I was a kid.  I have since read some of the newer stuff from Gaiman, Moore and Morrison and I still have to say that I feel Miller's work on this novel to be the best comic book I have ever read.  Only his Sin City comes close to moving me both in terms of the writing and the movie adaptation.

I was apprehensive at first as I know how frequently movie adaptations of great literature fail to live up to the promise of the source material but fans have nothing to worry about from this brilliant movie!  I decided to watch the standard dvd first and I was surprised at how well it upscaled on my blu ray player and I thought how could the picture and sound quality of the blu ray disc exceed this but it did!  Both the picture quality and especially the fantastic DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround sound quality were a marked improvement over the standard dvd.  Also included are a set of postcards of the Batman but I frankly was not interested in that as I was in the fantastic blu ray content.  Putting aside animation versus real-life biases I have to say that this is truly the best Batman movie ever made.  I have seen the Nolan and Burton as well as the many other attempts but this one trumps them all.  If I had to pick a non-animated best Batman movie it would have to be the Burton first installment but overall this one is by far the best Batman movie ever and this fantastic blu ray release comes very very highly recommended!",1387065600,,2035,4.1923076923076925

5840813,2,B00DP9MDE4,"It is hard to review this product since I was one of the ones who waited with bated breath for the ""Dark Knight Returns"" comic and read each with a fervor, waiting in anticipation for the next one to arrive the next month. The fourth and final part seemed to be delayed for YEARS when, in reality, it was a few weeks late. So, needless to say, it might be my favorite comic of all-time. As such, I have always considered it impossible to adapt in any other medium. This attempt, while admirable, falls short so much because it is a literal adaptation of the comic. I was genuinely surprised at how much of Frank Miller's opus they were able to use given the explicit adult content of the original. Censorship was not an issue. However, there is dullness to seeing the comic brought in animation EXACTLY as it was in the comic. It seemed a pointless exercise. Moreover, the parts that I had problems with and that don't hold up become exacerbated in this medium. Finally, the running internal dialogues that were essential to the story become lost in the translation. The comic worked because we were able to experience the fractured and broken thinking of our hero as well as the villains. The animated version really limits our ability to think and feel along with the characters.

Add half-a-star to my review if you have not read the comics. But, truthfully, if you want to explore this, get a copy of the graphic novel. This is truly a story that for many reasons only works in its native form.",1386374400,4,1498,4.527675276752768

5840816,3,B00DP9MDE4,"My review is about the DVD Deluxe Edition Set, and I'm going to focus on the features of that as a product as opposed to the quality of the movie, which you can find plenty of opinions about.

DVD collectors offer crave the ultimate edition. When they released this movie individually as two parts many of us knew that the combined parts would be released together eventually as an ""ultimate"" edition and waited for this. Unfortunately, this could be better.

I am used to seeing chapter selection menus with every DVD. I don't use them often, but they are certainly useful when I do need to use them. Considering that this movie combines the two parts that were released separately, making it a two and a half hour film, it really needs chapter selections menus. The DVD menus are pretty barebones. This isn't a make or break issue as a whole, but it does leave something to be desired which a deluxe edition shouldn't do in such an obvious way.

There are two discs of special features, one of which is just 5 episodes of cartoons mostly from Batman the Animated Series. They don't really have much to do with the feature besides being Batman animated episodes, and they are tonally quite different. This is quality material but a lot of collectors will probably have this material already and because it is so tonally different from the main feature, if they don't have it it might be because they aren't interested in it. The other disc has some documentary featurettes are pretty good but pretty short. There is no commentary or feature about the transition from graphic novel to animated feature so while you could make some connections between the discs (really only with disc 1 and disc 3), there really isn't that natural connection that bridges them.

Somethings are still missing. There is room for improvement.",1386201600,7,1822,4.738170347003154
5840817,3,B00DP9MDE4,"This is a great DC motion comic movie.  The special features are alright, nothing that can't be seen on YouTube.  My only complaint is that the film is played back to back, stripping the credit and score from Part 1 , which delivered a dramatic effect to make you want to watch part 2.  Overall, it's a great addition to your Batman collection, but I would have rather bought it individually.",1386115200,4,392,4.492957746478873
5840818,3,B00DP9MDE4,"For better or worse, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns ushered in the avalanche of superhero films produced during the past thirty years.  In the years leading up to that 1984 comic, popular memories of Batman were of the campy Sixties television series featuring Adam West as the Caped Crusader.  TDKR introduced a gritty, nihilistic - indeed, apocalyptic - take on the entire Batman mythos.  Bruce Wayne reentered crimefighting as an obsessed old man; his Gotham City a chaos of nightmarish urban violence.  TDKR's Batman owes much to the Seventies' Dirty Harry and Travis Bickle, but in the comic book venue, this character was - well, novel.

The Nineties also saw the highly-respected Batman: The Animated Series.  Its episodes were grittier (and peculiarly more mature) than the contemporary Batman films.  The Naughts followed with Christopher Nolan's realistic take on the Dark Knight.  An animated version of TDKR therefore had high standards to meet.  Did it meet that standard?  Well...

The animation style deserves credit for closely mimicking the comic book.  The weakness of the animated version is an area where The Animated Series excelled: the voice acting.  The choice of Peter Weller as Batman is fine - albeit as subtle as a jackhammer.  Weller's claim to fame is as Robocop (1986), a film that owes much to TDKR.  Thankfully, his Bruce Wayne doesn't mimic Alex Murphy; whereas the latter was (ironically) earnest, the former speaks with an ever-present growl.  Nuanced?  No, but effective.

The supporting actors are the problem.  David Selby voices Commissioner Gordon.  Old timers like me remember him from the Eighties series Falcon Crest.  His voice is so distinctive that it is a distraction from the character.  The voice actor chosen for the Joker is... a joke.  He didn't have to be Mark Hamill - in fact, he shouldn't - but his voice simply doesn't fit.  The voice cast is actually large, but the variety of vocal types is poor.  It actually feels like a Seth Macfarlane-type actor voiced half the parts.

There are slight changes from the original text here and there; most of the changes slightly detract from the story.  The animated version makes it emphatically clear that Batman never murders his foes.  The sarcastic Batman's ""(I'm using) rubber bullets, honest."" becomes a scene in which a villain examines actual spongy rubber rounds.  For some reason, the ghoulish delight depicted in the news media in the comic book (and copied in 1986's Robocop) has largely been omitted from the animated TDKR.  The worst changes come when supporting voice actors fail to pick up the ironic twist of certain lines of dialogue.

If you do purchase this film, make sure that it includes both discs - apparently the Deluxe Version.  There's no reason to pay too much for volumes one and two.  The extras consist mainly of a random collection of other animated Batman features.  The inclusion of a few Batman: The Animated Series episodes show what this animated effort is missing.

For those who remember TDKR affectionately, watch this film.  For others... perhaps not.",1386115200,,3093,5.031558185404339

I am an adult, and parts of it still disturb me.

The original story by Frank Miller is a classic, so if you are a Batman fan, you should probably check this out.  But be warned, come into it with low expectations.

I just realized that the 2 DC animated films that I've enjoyed the most (""Flashpoint"" and ""Under the Red Hood"") were both based on stories that I hadn't read when I originally saw the film.

5840837,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I have already reviewed part 1 of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" so I'll skip to a brief review of the 2nd part. Put simply, I was engrossed from minute one. How could I not be? Brilliant actors, fantastic animation, and a story we know and love adapted by people who know the material well. The clincher on this one is The Joker. I was skeptical of Michael Emerson's approach to the character at first, and I didn't quite buy his voice for the character. Until he laughed. It captured all the mayhem and insanity we expect from someone playing Joker and did it with style. The same can be said for Mark Valley's version of Superman. Like Tim Daly, I found his voice perfectly suited for Superman, that calm (almost placating) soothe that tries to let Bruce Wayne know who is in control, and the slight underlying frustration when he realizes that Bruce isn't buying it. So, like Part 1, Part 2 delivers everything you could want.

About this Deluxe Edition which combines the two parts into one long movie: I'm so glad they didn't just package it as both parts on separate discs but in one box set. They took the time to combine the two into one seamless film, and seamless it is. Nevermind that this is animated, this felt like watching a full-length motion picture. It begs the question of how it might have done as a theatrical release (I'll bet it would have done modestly well). While the two parts were initially split at a logical point in the story, putting them together feels just as natural (almost as if you had the original 4 parts of the comic, but bought the collected graphic novel as well). The special features are all fantastic, offering some great commentary on the story, the movie, and the industry itself. As many other reviewers have noted, the Frank Miller documentary is a wonderful feature and covers a lot of information about the state of comics (particularly DC) in the 80s, Batman as a character, and the process of creating such an iconic piece of literature. I truly enjoyed watching it, even at its length (it is about an hour and a half long, which is a bit much for most dvd special features IMO).

If you already purchased the 2 parts of this film individually, you might want to try selling them and buying this one instead. I don't normally condone double-dipping (which it would be if you already own parts 1&2), but the presentation and the additional Miller documentary truly make this collection worth owning. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that they cram 3 discs into a 2-disc case. Shell out the extra money for a proper case, WB. It isn't like your Batman franchise doesn't make the money to support it. Other than that, I would recommend this to any Batman fan.",1383177600,3,2718,4.556237218813906

Batman in this story is getting up there in years but he can still take a wupping and dish one out too, and there are three, count 'em, THREE, epic battles in this two part film, and none of them feel rushed or forced.

While Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are not present as their iconic roles, Peter Weller does a great ""older"" sounding Batman, and Michael Emerson (Harold Finch from Person of Interest), does a fantastic Joker.

5840846,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I do not own, or had seen either of the two parts on their own so you can take my review from that perspective.

At first, I was hesitant to pick up this movie because the trailers did not really impress me, especially in terms of the art. The movie simply looked ugly, but I am happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised to find I was wrong. What ultimately pulled me towards this movie was that I was looking for a DC movie where the world was not ideal, and our superheroes were more than just a face. And this movie delivered, and brought dessert with it too.

The art fits the mood and story extremely well. The details are in the right places, and everything has a grim look to it, and it carries some weight. The only ""cheesy"" looking parts of the film are the cars which are straight-up CGI inserts, but those are kept to a minimum throughout. Otherwise, this a terrifically animated movie and it was very enjoyable to look at. The art style is different, but it works in favor of the story.

However, the movie does not end at just its animation. The voice acting is outstanding to say the very least. I especially enjoyed Peter Weller's performance of Batman, and it just synced perfectly to the character and mood. Of course, the rest of the cast was very good as well with the exception of the Joker. I might be stuck thinking he should sound like the Joker from The Animated Series, but I do feel something was missing in this film when the Joker took the stage.

In terms of the story, you get closure on several of Batman's arch-villains in one form or another. It was quite the ride, and spanned quite a bit of development, and it did not look like they downplayed any of the violence (though I do not know the comic source). However, at the same time, none of it felt really rushed, and in a way it all fell into place over the course of the 2+ hour movie. The ending itself could have gone a different direction, but I'm fine with the direction they took. In addition you also get several references to the 80s (some direct and some indirect) along with the Soviet Union and nuclear holocaust looming in the distance. And of course, you even get some Superman in there for good measure without even mentioning how you get to see the side of Bruce Wayne that you don't get to very often.

In terms of what you get with the Blu-ray edition, there is the main Blu-ray disc, a special features disc, and the DVD disc. In addition, there is the Ultraviolet code and 4 art drawings based on the movie. The special features disc contains a few episodes from Batman: The Animated Series and one episode from Batman: The Brave and the Bold. I honestly did not buy this movie for the special features so I have not looked at the rest.

Ultimately, if you are looking for a Batman movie that focuses on the more darker side of society, then Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is the Batman movie for you. I was more than impressed.",1381536000,3,2942,4.3497267759562845
5840847,5,B00DP9MDE4,"This movie combines Dark Knight Returns Parts I and II.  At two and half hours it's a tour de force.  It's an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns. For those of you who don't know; it's about a fifty five year old Batman returning to fight the Joker for the last time. Cities burn, villains meet a horrible demise, and the world of Batman is never the same.

Peter Weller was the voice of Batman.  The producers could have used Kevin Conroy, the original animated series actor with equal success.  I think there was a bit of stunt casting here. However, Weller has the captured the spirit of the character.  It's one part Robocop/one part an elder Batman. It's just another interpretation. I do think that if Conroy was in this role he would have been more emotional in his delivery.

This one is not your father's Batman from the Adam West era.  It's a PG movie that is no more violent than the latest Sylvester  Stallone Expendables film. However it encompasses a lot of adult subject matter.  If you are a fan of the caped crusader, this is a movie you'll watch several times. Out of all the DC animated films, this one's the best! Batman fans faith was rewarded after twenty seven years of waiting. I wish this film was adapted in a live action format. That was when Tim Burton decided to cast Michael Keaton in the role in 1989.",1381363200,9,1364,4.48582995951417

5840850,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Frank Miller's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>&nbsp;is considered to be one of the seminal works in the comics canon, and for good reason: it's an adult, layered work with elements of social and political satire and rich, often-disturbing characterizations of Bruce Wayne/Batman and the other denizens of Gotham. The story's complexity made it clear to Bruce Timm and the DC Animated Universe team that the usual 80-minute long adaptation could not hope to capture the essence of Miller's story, and so the decision was made to split the book into two films.

This Deluxe Edition joins the two halves together for the first time via a ""seamless"" edit into a single film. Despite not having seen the separate parts, nonetheless there is a moment roughly at the midpoint of the feature that smashes to black before continuing, so it is my belief that they simply removed the credits from Part 1, spliced on Part 2, and tagged on a new credit sequence with the cast and crew from the full feature. Structurally, the film still narratively plays as two conjoined halves, but the consistency of the overall tone and thematic motives throughout, as well as of the cast and crew, keep the full 148-minute presentation relatively unified. It's nice to have the full story all in one place.

In terms of quality, ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" is right at the top of the DCAU canon. The source material is of course top notch, and director Jay Oliva and screenwriter Bob Goodman have hewn closely to Miller's opus. Minor incidents have been omitted and certain aspects of the narrative have been shuffled (again, necessary to the production of the film in two parts), but the core of Miller's material is in there. The largest change is the removal of much of Batman's inner monologue. But for a single voice-over in the ""rebirth"" sequence, this aspect has been excised from the film. This was originally a major concern for me because so much of the comic's best writing is located within these internal monologues, but enough of the best material has been incorporated into dialogue or otherwise dramatized to satisfy, and the film is much better off than if they had simply slathered voice-over narration all over the place. Like a cherry on top of a rich sundae, a definite sense of 1980s style is infused throughout the film through the production design, slang, and music, much like in Zach Snyder's underrated live-action adaptation of Watchmen.

The voice cast is solid. Peter Weller's portrayal of Batman seemed flat in the trailers I had viewed prior to the release of the film, but in context he's just fine. A few moments here and there weren't quite convincing, and I -- as would many of my generation, I suspect -- would have preferred Kevin Conroy in the role, but overall I'm happy with the result. David Selby as Jim Gordon doesn't quite sound right at first, missing a more athletic timbre more common in other animated incarnations of the character, but his world-weariness grew on me. Michael Emerson's Joker is frighteningly cerebral and restrained. The rest of the voice cast, including Ariel Winter as Carrie Kelly, Mark Valley as Superman, Michael McKean as Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, and with bit parts filled by the likes of Paget Brewster, Grey DeLisle, Robin Atkin Downes, Maurice LeMarche, Tress MacNeille, Rob Paulsen, Wade Williams, and Conan O'Brien (!), is excellent.

As a digitally-animated film, the video transfer is quite good with vivid detail and excellent color; I noticed aliasing in several places, but this likely is a flaw of the source material. The audio is in DTS-HD 5.1, and while it's not reference quality it does a fine job of immersing you into the film with excellent bass in Christopher Drake's pulsing electronic score and in the action sequences.

The main benefits of this Deluxe Edition, other than gathering the full adaptation in one package, lie in the new bonus material. The first new extra is a feature-length commentary track with director Jay Oliva, writer Bob Goodman, and voice director Andrea Romano. It's an engaging, informative track with very little self-congratulation, focusing instead on their reasoning behind various decisions in the adaptation and in the process. If you're a fan of commentaries, you will enjoy it.

The second, and arguably more important, new extra is ""Masterpiece,"" a 78-minute documentary centered around Frank Miller and the creation of the graphic novel itself. Interviewees include Miller, Klaus Janson, Dennis O'Neil, Jenette Khan, Michael Uslan, and Grant Morrison, among others. It focuses on Miller's rise in comics and the decisions that went into the creation of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and is very informative.

It should also be mentioned that all extras from the releases of Part 1 and Part 2 (production featurettes, bonus episodes from the animated series, and digital comics excerpts) are included, minus previews for Part 1 and Part 2, which makes sense now that the feature is present as a whole. Except for the commentary, all the extras are housed on a second Blu-ray disc that is unfortunately stacked underneath the feature disc to leave room for the DVD copy of the film on the package's second spindle, but as Blu-rays are very scratch-resistant this is really a nitpick.

Finally, a note to parents: this is not a film for children. In fact, I am utterly amazed that this was released with a PG-13 rating. There are sustained sequences of graphic, bloody violence and hundreds of people are murdered quite unambiguously on screen, in addition to mature themes of insanity, sexual innuendo, and impending nuclear war. I am not a prude nor do I believe that any of the violence of the film should be excised, but I would advise that the film be treated as though it has an R-rating.

All things considered, this is a fine package of an excellent animated adaptation of one of the most celebrated comics of all time and is more than worthy of my highest recommendation.",1379289600,208,6135,5.072348860257681

5840852,5,B00DP9MDE4,"Most likely if your here its because your a ""semi"" big Batman fan or bigger. While I can see many coming her and claiming that this is simply a cash grab on DCs part I will gladly toss 20 dollars their way for this amazing set! I already own parts one and two and while many see this as a petty attempt for DC to make another last minute buck, the fact remains that the original parts separately did not do that well financially. Heartbroken because this has actually been my second favorite DCU release I came back to the well in order to support this full flick. I don't want the lack of money this movie got affect future possible DC releases. Im sure we all want to see a ""Arkham Asylum"" and ""Killing Joke"" movie someday.

To be honest the movie flowed much better as one film as aposed to two. That was one reason I didn't mind shelling out the 20 bucks. The other huge reason is obviously the 70 minute long Frank Miller documentary. If you don't know who Frank Miller is, shame on you (Lets pretend however he never made Strikes again or All Star). If you are like me a true Batman fan I consider this set a must have even if you do have the earlier editions there will be something from this collectors set that will keep you happy. And if this is your first time traveling to the world of ""Dark Knight Returns"" buy this fine collectors edition that contains everything you could possibly need to get the best viewing experience possible with a epic movie on one disc, and a satisfying amount of extras on another.

As for the animation, I personally don't like the americanized anime look this and most recent cartoons have.

5840855,1,B00DP9MDE4,"I just cannot get into Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns as much as I could with Dark Knight Strikes Again.
Trying to get past the lazy artwork that not even the publishing company of Tijuana Bibles would give the time of day. The crude, over-weight, distraught slop that passes off of ""art"" really leaves little room for debate. To further add salt to the wound, time, money and other resources have been invested into the production of what may be THE WORST Batman (anything) ever.
That says a lot considering the dog vomit the Nolan films were.
As for this video, I have seen it when I saw ""Part I"" and ""Part II.""
However, amazon will be flooded with reviews for this movie that will somehow attempt to justify being unique by out-reviewing what has already been seen with ""Part I"" and ""Part II.""
Bottom line, it's still the same movie with a ****load of extras which are a bunch of people just talking for the sake of talking so they can collect a paycheck afterwards.
Frank Miller is the one who did all the ((cough)) 'work' though.
I've already been approached by over four people, two of whom are in the movie industry (Blockbuster video store and Redbox technician) that have expressed interest in me bringing my story of the ONE TRUE Batman to the big screen. As of yet, few have actually come close. The junior high kids the props department in my after school drama club are hard at work making costumes for our movie. It's a cross between ""Pitch Perfect"" without the singing and ""Blair Witch Project"" with a bit of the origninal 1974 ""Gone in 60 Seconds.""
The storyboards alone for this film were done in the art department by the eighth graders have really put to shame the crummy scribbles of Frank Miller. One of the kids draws like superstar artist Rob Liefeld, but better.
After I collect all my royalities from this movie, I plan to reward the kids for all of their hard work with a hot dogs and ice cream ground pool party behind my rental house.

UPDATE: After having  viewing this movie (both parts I and II) a recent pizza and NyQuil shots party the kids from my class this week, I can honestly say that this has got to be THE WORST animated Batman I have ever seen.",1376524800,9,2189,4.483709273182957
5840856,5,B00DP9MDE4,"I have rented both parts of the original movie, and I have to say, it's one of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies's best.

The animation is crisp, clear, and, unlike some of DC's animated films (Superman's chin in ""Superman vs the Elite""/Bulky Aquaman in ""Flashpoint Paradox""), works really well.
The voice acting is great, but, then, what should I expect, as these movies's voice acting qualities are usually some of their best parts. Michael Emerson particularly stands out as the Joker, and Peter Weller of RoboCop fame does a fine job of bringing bulky Bats to life.
The writing is clever, introducing new elements along with some of Frank Millar's original work.

""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" has hit the high mark, and joins the ranks of such classics as ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" & ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox.""

So, in all, the film definately deserves five stars. But what about the new Blu-ray?

Now, I know many people will rage about Warner's decision to split the movie in two, have bunches of fans buy them, and then release the complete movie, with extra features to boot. And it is pretty cheap of them.

But, most people who have gone through multi-part stories would've learned by now that eventually they're released together. Even seperate films in a series are released together. I anticipated this, which is why I tried both parts on iTunes via rent, & I enjoyed them! Therefore, I waited for it's, ahem, ""Deluxe"" edition.

My patience even has more rewards than normal:
 - Having both films back-to-back, edited together will be helpful, as I will not have to switch discs (lazy, I know, but how many of you people out there wouldn't enjoy this, huh? That's what I thought)
 - An hour long Frank Millar documentary
 - An audio commentary for the entire film

The main question is for all you who already bought both parts of the Dark Knight Returns: ""Is it worth it?""
The answer; ""Well, that depends on you.""

Are you okay with switching the discs, not having to pay any money to save yourself a little bit of time?
Do you not mind missing out on an audio commentary, or a Frank Millar documentary? In other words, for the special features, are you just a casual Batfan?
Die-hards will definately want the special features, so I will, but casual Batfans will likely be able to pass. Anyway, there are tons of great features on the two seperate discs already.

Now, to finish off this review for those people too lazy to read the paragraphs above:
 - Movie (5 out of 5)
 - Buy the Deluxe edition?
(Casual: No)
(Die-hards: Yeah)

By the way, parents should not show kids under 10 this film. It's a grim, gritty interpretation of Batman that'll leave children with their mouths dropped at the level of blood & gore this film contains. Especially in the final battle between Batman and Joker.

8595783,5,B00DP9MDE4,"As my headline states, I feel that this film comes in a very close second to Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, which I remember seeing as a kid with my Dad in theaters at a time when the amazing Batman: The Animated Series was on TV. Thats a very hard thing to accomplish in my eyes, as Ive seen, and own every single DC Animated Batman film released thus far, including the Justice League animated films that feature Batman, such as Flashpoint Paradox, which comes in 4th for me after Batman: Year One.

This film is everything I ever wanted from DCs Animation branch. As a professional artist, my favorite comic book artists are Jim Lee, Alex Ross, Greg Capullo, Joe Madueria, Chris Bachalo, Jason Fabok, Alvin Lee, Mark Texeira, Sara Pichelli, Humberto Ramos, Adam Kubert and many others. Frank Miller isn't on my list for various reasons, and by animating The Dark Knight Returns in a style thats more polished than his work, but in keeping with its overall style, it looks the way I visualized it in my head as a kid. Even in the lead up to this films release, some of the team involved in its production spoke at comic con candidly behind the scenes about how they wanted to address some of the garish caricatures in the short news segments when they started the process of making this film.

The art and animation are truly both top notch by any standard. With that out of the way, this initially 2 part animated film, collected as one complete story for this Blu-Ray release, is a masterpiece. I truly felt like Id miss Kevin Conroy, the literal voice of Batman for every Animated Series fan, in this film. Initially, while I did miss his nuance, brilliant cadence, as well as compassion and intensity in both the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman; Peter Weller brought a hard, disgruntled feel to the role that fit the much older, rugged looking Batman seen here. It works, but for die hard Animated Series fans, it grows on you after seeing it a few times.

From here on, there may be some big spoilers for those who haven't seen this film, or read the original graphic novel.

Its important to note there are a few minor story alterations, such as the lack of an inner monologue, as well as a change in Batman killing the armed mutant holding the young child hostage early on, here, he no longer kills him which shows that he still has compassion despite his past. In my humble opinion, while I do miss the monologue, the other change fits well, as does the minor change in the scene where the Joker is on a late night talk show. The first change, not including the omission of an inner monologue, sits more in line with Batman as a comic book character lately, despite keeping his much more violent grit that was heavily on display in The Dark Knight Returns. The other change slightly tones down the violence of the late night talk show scene in the graphic novel. The grocery store fight still features the lady with the incredibly horrible symbol, though shes far more discrete than in the graphic novel, which is a good change that readers of the original graphic novel will understand. It was probably motivated by the PG-13 rating, which somehow allowed the violence of the original story to slide in without much sanitization.

In general, its still a very brutal film though in every regard and almost entirely faithful to its source material. Im actually surprised that those parts were even toned down given how faithful the ending was, complete with the joker twisting his own neck, as well as the brutality of the theme park fight and every amusement park scene leading up to it. Its definitely astonishing that this wasn't rated R, not just for violence, but overall tone. If you're a parent, you may want to watch this first before letting your little ones see it, because despite its PG-13 rating, theres far more violence, adult themes and grittiness on display than the PG-13 rating would normally allow for.

As for the main event, the famous fight with Superman at the end is stunningly well done, and the reason why they fight is so much more compelling than the way their showdown occurred in Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. For any longtime Batman fan, or even relatively new Batman fans, looking to see one of the best Batman stories told, in animated form, this films amazing. It keeps the original character deconstruction in tact, as well as adding layers of depth to Batman, not simply by aging him greatly, but by using his age as a form of history building, increased wit, combat training and experience, in addition to resourcefulness. Adding Carie as Robin was also one of the best parts of the original story in so many ways, due to how she helps Batman learn more about his limitations, work around them and also regain some of his caring humanity, after helping him recover from his brutal beating at the hands of the mutant leader.

I loved it, and its a definite must buy for any Batman fan, as well as a love letter from DC Animation to its fans. To get around the budget limits of DCs animated film devision, and do this film the justice it deserved, they initially made it a two part saga released as 2 separate Blu-ray/DVDs, after a few months apart, release wise. Now its properly collected as one, slightly under 3 hr film with excellent production values and behind the scenes extras.",1530489600,,5337,4.599789915966387
