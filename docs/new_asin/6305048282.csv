955268,3,6305048282,"If you like the original DragonBall humor then you will love this saga.  It is not an action packed saga by any means.  The first two discs are where your fighting occurs, otherwise this saga is meant to show life on Earth seven years after the fight with Cell.  If you only like the action packed part of DragonBall Z then I would not get this saga.  If you are a true DragonBall Z fan then this another must have.  I love DragonBall Z, but I do think, as a whole, this is the weakest out of all the sagas.  I love DragonBall too and this kind of brings that kind of style back during Gohan's time at high school.

  The saga begins with Goku fighting in a tournament in the after life, where he goes up against a very strong fighter name Pikon.  The battle is intense and both fighters unleash powerful moves that are capable of defeating anyone.  However, the fight's end is a most surprising and unexpected end.

  The saga continues with Gohan attending high school Herculopolis High.  Here Gohan meets the daughter of Hercule, named Videl.  Videl is a gifted fighter, by human standards, and is a figher of crime for the city.  Gohan also is fighting the crime on the streets but becomes worried that people will know who he is, so he goes to Capsule Corp. to ask the one and only Bulma.  This is where the Great Saiyaman disguise is created, thus launching much talk amongst the people of the city about the new hero.

  Videl is smarter than Gohan expects and she soon makes the connection of who he is.  In order for her not to reveal his identity she makes Gohan agree to train her how to fly.  This is an enjoyable part of the saga where Videl is introduced to energy and the ability to use it to fly.  She informs Gohan of the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament and expects him to participate.

  The Z Fighters decide to train and rejoin for the World Tournament because Goku has revealed that he will come back for one day to participate in the tournament.  You will have to watch and see how Goku is able to return and see the great reuniting of all the Z Fighters since the Cell Games.  Classic saga for true DragonBall Z fans.",1375401600,,2147,4.337531486146096

While searching for Dragonballs Videl, Goten, and Trunks encounter the Legendary Super Saiyan. They are of course no match for him; and Goku has to step in. This is not one of the better DBZ movies. This movie is a bit lacking in the action department. It's kinda not cool that there trying to rehash the Broly thing again; it won't be the last time either. They did very well with the 2nd Cooler movie, but don't expect the same quality from this one. It's an entertaining movie to watch, but it's also one of those where you probably won't remember jack about it a few months after you see it.

It takes everyone in the Dragonball galaxy to take him out, and Vegeta is a coward. And if he's so strong, why does nobody go to SSJ2? Or SSJ3? So I thought the second would be better. Boy was I wrong. In the first movie, Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Future Trunks, Gohan and Krillin couldn't defeat Broly. In the second one, Broly has trouble even putting a scratch on Chibi Trunks and Goten. This movie is what the DBZ staff and FUNimation do when they're bored.

Not only that, Broly comes across as a real dufuss in this one - the endless repetition of his grunted one line gets really annoying and in itself merits the whooping that he gets in the end.  Broly was a ruthless villian bent on destruction in his first appearance, but he just kind 'floats around' in this one not really doing much of anything.

955378,3,6305048282,"In all respects this film was not as good as the first Brolly film, nor many of the other films, like Lord Slug, History of Trunks, and Coolers Revenge. In fact it merely acts as a continuation of the DBZ world for the hard core fans, broader anime fans won't enjoy it as much. This is brought on by the meandering nature that comes across from the positioning of the central characters of Kid Trunks; Goten; and Videl, who are looking for the Dragon Balls. Theres alot of familiar humour that ardent DBZ fans will enjoy. And the climax is the usual, though the battle between Teen Gohan and Brolly is ok.

A film for deep seatd Dragon Ball Z. I'd much more recommend Cooler's Revenge, probably because of the great rock and metal sound track with Disturbed and Drowning Pool.",1164672000,,776,4.50354609929078

The battle between Gohan and Cell appears to be nearing its end as Gohan has finally awakened his hidden power, but the power may be going to Gohan's head.  This arrogance will cause a sacrifice to be made by the man who has saved the earth many times before.  When Cell finally appears to be dead, he comes back even more powerful than ever.  In a flash the tables turn and Gohan can barely put up a fight.  All hope seems lost, but some last minute advice from the Other World may just be the final spark Gohan needs to finish Cell once and for all.  Who shall win the Cell Games?

4 excellent episodes of Dragon Ball Z.  These episodes are heavy on the fighting and one is really emotional as well.  The violence is very graphic so as the DVD says I suggest this to fans 13 and up.",1152835200,2,917,4.129943502824859
955483,5,6305048282,"The Tournament Saga of Dragon Ball contains 15 episodes of Dragon Ball on just 2 discs which is a terrific deal. Originally, Dragon Ball was an action show, but with quite a bit of comedy as well which true fans of the show can appreciate. I love the jokes in Dragon Ball almost as much as the fighting.  The comedy left at the beginning of the King Piccolo Saga and the show became darker and focused almost entirely on fighting.  However, during the Majin Buu Saga of Dragon Ball Z the action and comedy split began to appear again.

Specifically, this saga introduces quite a few new characters including Krillin and Launch.  It depicts Goku and Krillin's training under Master Roshi and then moves on to the 21st Annual World Martial Arts Tournament.  Goku and Krillin enter the tournamnet but find some tough competition and soon discover a method behind Roshi's madness in the way he has trained the boys.  The fights are a split, some hilarious and others action packed.  In Dragon Ball, the battle of Goku vs. Jackie Chun ranks in my top 10 fights Goku ever participated in.  The tournament ends with a shocking move, but who will be the victor?

Overall this is a saga which mixes action and comedy beautifully and is one of my favorites in Dragon Ball.  The 15 episodes on 2 discs is a great deal.  I recommend these episodes to any fan of DB or DBZ with some caution to younger viewers in that there are quite a few perverted jokes, but they are in part what makes the show fun to watch.",1152489600,4,1498,4.470588235294118

955485,5,6305048282,"Before the actual review, I urge all of those who read the review for this product written by ""SeniorIKnowRealMetal"" NOT to pay any attention to the comment he made on how Dragon Ball Z compares to the Gundam series (""This blows the [...] out of stupid idiotic robot stuff like Gundam."").  Not only did he state it with all the eloquence of an eleven-year-old boy (""blows the [...]out of""?), but the fact that he considers DBZ to be somehow less ""idiotic"" than Gundam suggests that he has never watched more than one or two episodes of a Gundam series, or, if he has, did not have the maturity or attention span to understand and appreciate them.  While I do prefer Dragon Ball Z, with its lovable characters and exciting battles, to Gundam, I do acknowledge that the latter is on an entirely different intellectual level; twelve-year-olds will have a much more difficult time comprehending the complex themes touched upon in the Gundam series than they do the excessive, often mindless fighting in DBZ.  To say that any Gundam series, with the exception of perhaps SD Gundam (which was targeted at very young children), is ""stupid"" and ""idiotic"" in comparison to DBZ is extremely foolish and ignorant.  Once again, I urge readers not take that reviewer's comment seriously.  It would be a shame if one person's ignorance turned others away from a wonderful series.

With that said, I'll get on to the product I'm supposed to be reviewing.  The episodes contained on this DVD make up the finale in the Cell Games saga, which is, in my opinion, the most entertaining story arc that Dragon Ball Z has to offer by far.  The voice acting is done well, and the background music inserted over the original for the English dub is wonderful.  Note that those who prefer the original Japanese music/voices can opt to watch the original versions of the episodes with English subtitles rather than the dubbed versions.  I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who has seen the rest of the Cell saga and wants to see how it all ends.",1150848000,,2023,4.721590909090909
955486,5,6305048282,"Dragon Ball Z is a Legendary Anime series that will go down in Anime History. Although looked down by some simply due to the fact that it targets a younger audience as well as older, I don't care what anyone says. This blows the crap out of stupid idiotic robot stuff like Gundam.

This saga proves Akira Toriyama's absolute genius in what is displayed as possibly the most dramatic (or at least one of the most dramatic) anime Saga's I've ever seen. From Trunk's Arrival to Cell's Death, this is hand's down the Best Chapter of the Entire Dragon Ball Z series... by FAR. This Dvd captures the Final 4 Episodes of the Cell Saga including Cell's Demise, restoring thing's back to normal with the Dragon Balls, and even Trunk's journey back into time to make things right where he was.

Although I more so just recommend trying to buy the Boxsets over time (if you have the money of course). Trunks/Android/Imperfect Cell/Perfect Cell/ and Cell Games. Of course all those box sets will cost an arm and a leg but are not to bad to buy if you get them slowly after time and you'll find it's worth it as this Saga is Any Anime Collector's Must-Have.

Dragon Ball Z is indeed a good anime series, although I more or less love it just because of the Android/Cell Chapter. The Saiyan and Namek sagas connected to the Freiza saga, which was good and all but dragged on way too long and had a bit too simple of a plot. It was basically just one big battle (which younger kid's would like of course, but I think even they would get bored, and I myself personally feel the need for at least some filler episodes to build up the plot). The Cell saga has an excellent plot dating all the way back to the Dragon Ball episode days.

I feel that at this point in the series, everything that a Classic Anime saga needed had been displayed. Drawn out, but not too drawn out of a plot. Plenty of Drama and Excellent Battles. Suffering of a Great Loss (Goku's Death), and of course the Dramatic display of Emotion as Gohan unleashed his Hidden Power. The Buu episodes dropped the Z series down a notch for a few reasons. Gohan is turned into a complete wimp for one. Sure he gets his ""Latent Capacities"" released, but it's done in the stupidiest and most lazy way possible. Also the battles in that Saga are more comical/cheesy than actually dramatic until the very tail end that is. I feel the Z series would've have done itself more justice to end right here. Nevertheless, Dragon Ball Z will always be remembered as a classic.",1149811200,2,2508,4.445652173913044

Movies in which the villain Goku beat comes back is a basicaly insult to his strength (its like saying he beat them, but isn't strong enough to kill them so Teen Gohan has to clean up behind his father). Of course I didn't mind this when Trunks killed Freiza For Goku in the trunks Saga. Goku Meant to mericful that time.

955673,1,6305048282,"I admit, I may be a fan of the overall DB franchise, but there's parts that try even my patience, or make me want to change the channel.  This is pretty much one of those times.  Despite the fact that this is the first of the three tournament arcs(the ones in DBZ don't count, as they were just quick wraparounds for the Buu arc as they weren't even completed), there just isn't really anything too enjoyable.  The writing itself doesn't even meet the standards of the later episodes, let alone the superior 22nd and 23rd tournaments(particularly the 22nd one), most notably the poor development of the other fighters.  In the 22nd and 23rd tournaments each and every character, not just our main group of Goku, Kuririn, Yamcha, and for this set Master Roshi, had their own motivations and goals for entering and competing among the top combatants in the world, whereas here, other than Namu, everyone else besides our previously mentioned heroes are pretty much just in it for.... the title of the champion, I guess.  The fighting itself is quite poor, even below the early DB standards.  Most of the battles are finished in one hit, and as a result lead in to a bit of unnecessary filler.  There's also of my least favorite aspects of the early Dragonball saga: the humor.  I absolutely hate the excuses for laughs... mainly because it mostly consists of potty humor and ""Master Roshi is a pervert"" jokes.  This humor is lowbrow.... too lowbrow(especially the Bacterian battle.... *shivers*), and it's also done too much, winding up more annoying than funny.

That's not to say that there's no good points.  The set does feature the first appearance of one of my favorite characters in the series, Miss Lunch, or Launch as she's known as in the American dubs, a sweet, caring, kind-hearted, almost angelic person who winds up turning into a blonde-haired, green-eyed, bank-robbing, gun-totting, rude, violent psycho whenever she sneezes, and the battle between Goku and Jackie Chun at the end is surprisingly decent.  Oh, and we get to see Yamcha with a beard.  Other than that though, this set is a waste of my time.  When you wind up wanting to change the channel after only seven or so minutes, you know you're not enjoying yourself.

The artwork and soundtrack for the fighting were quite good relative to other films, but there was just too little of it. Additionally, I was supremely disappointed in the plot of the film as it relates to Gohan's involvment.

It is obvious from the film that Broly's ultra-super saiyan form is more powerful than Gohan as a super saiyan, which is as it should be. However, at this point in the Dragonball timeline, Gohan can ascend to super saiyan 2.

Unfortunately, the writers of this film chose to ignore this ability, which, presumaby, could have led to the defeat of Broly. Clearly, this ability was ignored to rationalize the presence of Goku in the film - a very poor choice in my opinion.

If you are like me and watch these films for the artwork, soundtrack, and transformations to higher levels of consciousness (and the associated drama), then I think you will feel a bit let down.",1115078400,,955,4.633136094674557

Flash forward seven years later, Goten, Trunks and Videl are searching for the Dragon Balls because Videl wants to see Shenron.  They stumble across a village plauged by a demon.  they volunteer to help only to unwittingly awaken Broly.  Not understanding what they are up against they take him on only to be beaten badly until Gohan shows up.  With the help of Krillan and a fallen hero they put an end to Broly.

This is overall an ok movie.  The fight between Broly and Gohan was cool and the ending reminded me much of the Cell Games, but the fact that most of the movie is more comedic and revolves around Goten and Trunks, and Broly this time around is no longer the ruthless monster from the first, now he is an utterly insane beast who can only say the name Kakarot.

Gohan eventually joins in on the mix(Krillin too!), but Broly's too strong even for him and things don't look good as a result.  It's going to take a miracle to defeat Broly.

955870,5,6305048282,"Finally!  The long awaited conclusion to Dragonball Z's best saga.  I have to believe Funimation made a conscious decision to withold this collection of epeisodes from public release.  After all, why has the entire Majin Buu saga, right up to the ultimate conclusion of the Dragonball Z series, been available for so long, while the final demise of Cell has been selfishly guarded for so many years?

This DVD features what is, in my humble opinion, the best episode in the series' run.  Previously, the evil bio-android Cell, having been confronted with his inferiority at the hands of Gohan, attempted to self-destruct and take the entire planet Earth with him.

Selfless to the bitter end, Goku teleported himself and Cell to King Kai's planet, saving Earth at the cost of his own life.

Beware - Spoilers:

As we rejoin our heroes, the Z-fighters are mourning the loss of Earth's greatest champion, but wait...!  Cell has survived!  The bio-android returns to Earth by way of his newly acquired technique: Goku's own Instant Transmission!  Additionally, Cell has managed to revert to his previously forfeited ""Perfect"" stage.

Before anyone can react, Cell kills Trunks, sending Vegeta into a blind rage and an ill-advised series of attacks on the bio-android.  The Saiyan Prince's efforts are in vain, and he is quickly overpowered.  Gohan manages to intercede just in time to save Vegeta, but at a high price: the young warrior has lost the use of one of his arms.

Crippled and exhausted, can the son of Goku, and the last hope of the Earth extinguish once and for all the terror of Cell?

The conclusion of this saga is brilliantly executed, with sincere emotion, and a satisfying climax that sees the remaining Z-fighters pull together in a cooperative effort to defeat Cell.  As is often the case with the DBZ series, there may be several moments that drag on a bit too long, but in the end, even casual fans of Dragonball Z will not be able to deny the splendor of this collection.

The training is exciting and a lot of it is just hilarious. Some of the fights when the tournament starts are good too. For example, there is one fight with a girl who actually strips down to her underwear to try and force her opponent (a man) out of the ring. It doesn't work, but it is very funny to watch. (Esspecially Master Roshi's reaction.)
The episodes really are great fun, though. With the final battle being both amazing and surprising, it is not a set to be missed. The hilarious jokes (some perverted, some not) and the action-packed adventure are not things you will want to miss. As for the actual DVD, there are no extras, but the menus sure do work pretty well. Like all DB DVD's (except for Saga of Goku) it has both the Japaneese and the English version. The English version is done very well. Some of the sex jokes are toned down a bit, but they are still pretty good.

Picture has been greatly improved, but why does the Japanese sound have to be in mono?  Perhaps FUNimation is trying to get more people to watch the English version.
Seriously, if you purchased these episodes on VHS (uncut) individually, you'd be spending much more than if you were to buy it from this excellent set here.

Dragon Ball is one of the best animation series of all time and FUNimation has done an excellent job with this two dvd (uncut) set. I liked this set so much that I went ahead and ordered the Red Ribbon Army box set that follows this set. The only problem that arises is that FUNimation is skipping a few sagas after RRA saga. This is tolerable only because most people have probably already seen the skipped sagas on Cartoon Network.

This show is way underrated, probably due to its animation, which I believe is over a decade or two old.  Still, it is still great to look at, and even more entertaining to watch as everything unfolds.
This set is actually suppose to be the second set of the series.  The first one will probably be release later this year or early next year due to ownership rights of companies.  So if you are not familiar with this series or its successor, DBZ at all, then this set may not be for you since it is not the best place to start.  Despite that, it is still a great saga filled with laughter and cheers.  For only $40 retail, give it a shot.  I, for one, can't wait for the next installment.",1046217600,2,778,4.1466666666666665

The dvd also includes the original Japanese track with subtitles. This is interesting because it's a litte different from the sub, but not that much! The dub is actually funnier!

956177,5,6305048282,"The major drawback is no Prince, but we know he didn't enter until DBZ. The humor is high & the fighting low--none of the massive power-ups DBZ haters use as an excuse not to watch the show. Goku was a cute little alien & his co-horts not filled with angst & issues--Yamucha's still cool here, Bulma's scary, but ok, & Puar & Oolong are nice little comic sounding boards.
We meet Krillin--just a tinge bad like Yamucha was when we met him & Launch/Lunch(depending on if one is watching the dub or sub) in this set & anytime we get an Oozaru, I'm happy. Being uncut, there's a bit here some would find offensive for their little munchkins--Goku & even Krillin have frontal nudity(they seem to love skinny-dipping boys in Japan) & more than a bit on Master Roshi's perverse love of aerobics, dirty mags & female anatomy, but not much worse than one can see on tv now, although maybe not quite as concentrated. I was expecting worse from what I've read went on in the original run according to various Dragonball sources & it's nice to get the original story. The whole problem with any dub is interpretation/translation & there is no perfect translation from any language--something always gets lost so at least the subtitles aren't worried about cultural differences & playing to the American audience.  My first run thru a dvd is usually in English with the Japanese subtitles on(if the dvd has subtitles for both languages) to see how much of the story's been altered unless the English cast is really annoying & this is the Funimation crew we know already. We get the full length opening & closing themes we don't get on tv which is nice & some song during the Tourni I didn't hear because it's on the Japanese track--have to check it out next time--& the themes are in English as well as Japanese.

Music: B
English Version: A-
Fight Scenes: C
Comedic Scenes: B+
Okay, I won't lie to you. Dragonball is better for your funny bone than it is for your fists. Don't get me wrong. There is lots of action in this portion of Dragonball. In fact, it's the World Martial Arts Tournament portion so there is lots of action later on. But that takes a back seat in the first tape of the second season of Dragonball.
While Bulma and Yamcha head off for their own destinies together, Goku heads over to Master Roshi's to see if he'll train him. However, before he can teach him, Goku must perform a task for Master Roshi: Find him a girl. Goku, however, is not too lady smarts and ends up bringing back some oddball women. Master Roshi can see that Goku has not spent many time with people.
We are then introduced to Master Roshi's next student, Krillin. After easily getting Roshi's aprooval with some *ahem* reading material, Krillin helps Goku in his quest to find a girl for Roshi. Enter Launch. The next odd character. Whenever this blue haired innocent girl sneazes, she turns into a blond vixen. Roshi learns this hard way and now has to deal with her since Roshi promised Goku he could become a student if he brought Roshi back a girl.
The first portion of their training involves finding a rock specially labeled by Roshi. There are some fun antics in this episode. Krillin ends up cheating, but in the end, Goku is the real winner of this competition.
The music here is not tampered with. It's all there. There is some noticable grain in the show, but it shouldn't bother you too much. Thankfully, Krillin doesn't sound like he does on DBZ. The dub works in most areas and generally serves as a good script. Overall, if you have only been introduced to the edited version of Dragonball, this tape should be a real eye-opener and a big head-turner. Did I mention it will make you laugh?",1006300800,2,2036,4.5353260869565215
956268,5,6305048282,"Once Frieza has arrived on the scene, everything goes nuts. In ""Fighting Power One Million"" Frieza reveals the death of Vegita's father and Planet Namek. And to celebrate this reminising, he transforms into a giant. In ""Gohan's Attack"" Frieza attacks Krillin for the worst. Stabbing him in the stomach with his horn and throwing him into the lake. This leaves Gohan furious and he launches an all out assault against Frieza. Thanks to Dende, Krillin is ok, but Gohan is now the one in jeopardy. In ""Piccolo The Super Namek"" Krillin must lure Frieza away from Gohan until Piccolo arrives. One Piccolo arrives, things get ugly. In ""Deja Vu"" Frieza and Piccolo go one on one in an all out grudge match. Piccolo also reveals his new power after having fused with Nail.
The menus have really improved with nice music and fair graphics. Still, I wish FUNimation could include a different kind of extra instead of previews. The menu is basically inside a Capsule Corp ship. The video quality is much, MUCH improved over the last discs. You get the original opening and closings, but their textless, so don't expect to see the original Japanese voice cast. I thought Frieza in his second form sounded like Principal Kuno from Ranma 1\2.

956269,4,6305048282,"Well, let's see... this is the first Dragon Ball series offering that Funimation has given us since their first English dub of the first 13 episodes, back in 1995.  That dub was famous for its heavy amount of censorship, cutting all of the dirty humor of the series out, as well as doing some odd things to digitally-paint scenes.  These episodes, however, are from the new 2001 dub, which, among other things, is uncut for the home release (the Cartoon Network versions will be censored, though there are no plans to release them commercially).  The first 13 episodes have not been released uncut yet, because of the license to release them still being with KidMark, who sponsored those heavily-chopped episodes six years ago.  But enough  of that history lesson... on to the main review.
I'd say that the biggest news for these episodes, besides being completely uncut, is that they also use the original score for the series, by Shunsuke Kikuchi.  Yay, no more Faulconer synth-metal garbage!  It's actually brought out very well, being audible even with loud character speech and sound effects (where there is a severe problem with this in the dubs of the third and fourth seasons of a certain shoujo series by Naoko Takeuchi...).  It also seems to be remixed to come out in stereo.  In addition to having the original music, this video does something that Funimation has never done before: make English versions of the original Japanese themes.  They're both actually done very well, though on the tape, they seem kinda low-fidelity.  Maybe they'll sound better on the DVDs when they come out.  The English version of ""Makafushigi Adventure"" (""Profoundly Mysterious Adventure"") sounds good, although it seems a bit under-orchestrated when compared to the original.  The English ""Romantic Ageru Yo"" (""Romantic Flight!"") is closer to the original, though the woman who sings it (I believe it's Marron-the-Daughter's VA) gives it an almost seductive tone that's not wholly appropriate for the song.  Neither song is quite a direct translation of the original, though the lyrics that they use are fine.
These episodes comprise the start of the training under Muten Roshi, and introduce two new characters: Kuririn, known to dub fans as Krillin, and Roshi's psycho maid, Lunch (called ""Launch"" in the dub).  I actually like Kuririn's voice a lot.  Lunch's voices for her two personalities are decent, though I think they could stand some improvement.  The other characters have different voices than the dub from six years ago, as well, since Funimation stopped using Vancouver's Ocean Studios back in 1999, in favor of in-house talent.  Stephanie Nadolny's Goku is pretty much the same as she did Gohan's voice, though it seems more innocent (this may be due to the fact that Gohan is really pissed off a lot of the time, while Goku is usually happy).  Muten Roshi's voice (Mike McFarland) is the typical screechy, generic old man, but I love how much he puts into his perverted scenes.  Bulma is Tiffany Vollmer, and for the teenage version, the ""valley girl""-type voice actually fits.  Chris Sabat's voice for Yamcha (could he actually *gasp* be only voicing one major character this time?) seems to have improved as well, moving away from the rasp that he uses for Vegeta and Piccolo in DBZ.  The best news, though, is that this dub uses neither Dale Kelley (from DBZ dub seasons 3 and 4) nor Kyle Herbert (adult Gohan's VA and the narrator for DBZ season 5).  It uses a really good-sounding narrator, who isn't trying to sound like a complete idiot.  Very nice.
This tape is completely uncensored, and the dialogue is very close to the original's.  However, it does change in a few small spots.  Probably the most significant change is that when Roshi asks to know the color of the mermaid's panties in the Japanese version, in the English, they make him ask if she'll go for a walk with him.  Same result, though: Since she has a tail instead of legs, she neither wears panties or can walk.  Most of the other dialogue is spot-on, even in the perverted scenes, so I don't know exactly why they changed that specific exchange.  For example, they left in Goku's unique way of finding a person's gender (basically, he has to feel them up), as well as Kuririn's unabashed use of porno magazines to get Roshi to train him.
So, to sum it all up, it's uncut, it has good voices, the original music is left intact, the themes are done well, and the narrator doesn't suck.  If you want to wait for the DVDs, you can, but if you're a fan of Dragon Ball, you should at least look into renting it.  It's good stuff, and a nice change of pace from the sucky-to-mediocre dub (at least music-wise, now) of DBZ.  Hopefully, Funimation will continue the trend they've shown with this tape with Yu-Yu Hakusho and Blue Gender.",996451200,4,4812,4.816301703163017

Eleventh Hour:A: Freeza powers up a lot. But then relizes the only way to beat Goku is to blow up Namek it self! Goku gets hit down and Gohan (who had brout Piccolo and Bulma back to Goku's ship) had to aid him. But Goku was soon up and he told Gohan to leave Namek now.
Fall of a Titant:A: King Ki makes up a plan to save all on Namek,even those who are already dead! He will do this with the DRAGONBALLS. Freeza is on the ground in two pieces (a lot of unedited out blood!).
Nameks End:A-: Namek is just about to blow and Goku tries to help Freeza but Freeza turns on him and Goku must kill him. Then Namek blows and every one thinks Goku is now dead.

In ep. two they have to  hunt down doctor Gero.  Only the hunter becomes the hunted and piccolo must  face him. But there's one problem DR.Gero can repair him self and this is  episodes 2 of 3.  DR.Gero decides to go back to the lab and finish two more  androids!

956577,5,6305048282,is one of the best. Although i 've only seen the japanese (uncut) version i think you won't be  disappointed by the english one. And dont't think that Goku and Trunks are the only Super-Saiyajins..... A must buy for a  true Dragonball fan!,961891200,3,239,4.534883720930233

956579,5,6305048282,"Hello everyone out there who just adores Dragon ball z.  First off, I'd like to say that the voices done in the new series make the Z characters sound more adult.  Goku sounded like a girl before, and now we can actually  take him seriously!  I congradulate them all!  First, this video is sooo  awesome.  Watching Frieza transform is soo bizarre, and definantly worth  wathcing if you like Frieza.  The violence isn't that great, but what can  you expect?  It's sooo sad what he does to poor Dende!  If you like action  though, this is definantly the volume to get, especially if you like  Frieza.  I believe you get to see almost all of his forms, seeing his first  form, then his second form in the same episode, then he finishes off  transforming in his last form.  I personally love all the Z characters and  badguys, so I enjoyed this extensivly!  It does have some violence, after  all, but if you're not looking for the gory chopping heads off with hands  and blasting holes through ones torso, this is probably the best choice for  you!^_^",959299200,2,1048,4.545945945945946

956581,3,6305048282,Its  cool but with all the voice changing and censoring it gets kinda lame. I wish they left it the sama as in japan. But you no america no violence. They think we might go on a shooting rampage. On the mexican  channel they get to keep everything in. Why cant we.,947376000,,264,4.0576923076923075
956582,5,6305048282,I think this is the funniest video of dragonball z ever made. King Kie is a riot in Legend of the Saiyens. A little Grasshopper man! hehehehe. Bug me! hahahaha.and when Goku crushes his car and then comes around again it is  hilarious this is one episode all dbz fans must see. I watch it at least  onece a day if not twice(one in morn one in eve)  Great Video!  Yeah!,943142400,,368,4.140845070422535

956747,4,6305048282,This was good.  I've also see the japanese version and its a big difference.  There is no blood in this one.  I think its good for the kids.  Not that much violence in this version.  Overall its good.  Vegeta rules.  Gohan shows a lot of heart.  What else can you expect of Goku.,930787200,,279,4.132075471698113
956748,5,6305048282,"Yeah, yeah...5 stars I know...hey what do you expect...it's DBZ!  However, even though this is great and a joy to watch...it might be better to save your money...after all the exact same episodes air on cartoon network!  I  mean...if you just want to see them, then save your cash, but if you want  to watch them over and over...go for it.  None the less the point is, it's  nothing you haven't seen on tv before...except for the uncensoring which  probably makes the price worth it.  Still...well, if Amazon did bring some  episodes from farther in the series...it'd be heaven.  See goku kick the  snot out of Cell and have all the saiyajin become super... it's the only  way to go.  After all...what true fan hasen't seen the tv series at least  twice??  Oh, and a side note where the heck are DB and DBGT???",929664000,,810,4.527777777777778

956888,5,6305048282,"This fight is cool because of the way the Ginyu Force acts.  It has lots of good quotes like ""This is just great.  Do you know how long it's gonna take to get this dust outta my hair?"" ""Complain all you  want.  At least you've got hair!"" and ""Oops! I think i broke his  funny bone!""  The best part is when Goku finally gets there and taunts  he Ginyu Force with his speed.  He's so fast, you can't see his when he  dashes to somewhere.  It's a great series, but i wish they would finish.  They're leaving us hanging!  I think it's because they haven't finished  dubbing all the episodes, but could someone mail me about that?  Buy this  video, it rocks!!!!!",924480000,,657,4.270491803278689
