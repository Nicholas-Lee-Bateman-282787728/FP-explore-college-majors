1980613,5,B0001906OA,"I just got this dvd in an attempt to try something different.  I wanted to do something that was fun in my spare time and learn something new.  I have always been interested and dance and thought I'd try bellydancing.  I was nervous about whether this dvd would help me to learn or not, but it is very helpful.  Those who say it is not good for beginners have not spent the time to learn it.  The dvd breaks down the techniques for you to learn.  Although I am still trying to get those down, the instruction is very helpful, but practicing it is essential!  I wanted a little bit of a challenge when I was looking for a dvd, and this is definitely both helpful and challenging.  I am looking forward to learning the fulll choreography.  It's a lot of fun and I recomend this dvd to anyone who is up for the challenge to learn and have fun!",1099353600,13,840,4.2
1980674,5,B0001906OA,"Jillina explains the basic moves without spending too much time on each, and has a good teaching style. She is a world class performer, but also excels at choreography.  While you see some professional dancer's routines that are just really boring, the choreography featured is simple enough for a beginner to learn, but has enough movement, and variation to work as a routine for a club performance. We will look forward to getting the next DVD in this series.",1295568000,,461,4.8354430379746836
1980675,5,B0001906OA,Excellent video.  Good breakdown of movements.  Choreography is taught in segments and is very well explained.,1255305600,,110,5.8125
1980676,4,B0001906OA,Jinnian Breaks the moves down step by step. She starts with a warm up and works through some developmental exerersices.,1253836800,,119,5.0
1980677,5,B0001906OA,"I loved this DVD, and plan to buy her others. It is not the same level of instruction as you would get in a class. However it is great on instruction for the choreography and the final dance is great fun to do and if you do it several times you get your cardio on too.",1237248000,,268,3.8035714285714284
1980678,4,B0001906OA,"I've bellydanced for over 10 yrs and absolutely
loved this choreography to Alf La Waila Waila-
it's one of my favorite Arabic songs.

While I think one should always challenge his/her
abilities..I don't think this DVD is for the
beginner bellydance student b/c of some of the
combinations involved.",1217721600,,298,5.081632653061225
1980679,5,B0001906OA,"Jillina's teaching style makes bellydancing fun and as creative or difficult as you want it to be.  She demonstrates the dance you will learn.  She then breaks it down and shows a move, gives time for the student to practice, and later gives variations just before putting a whole routine together for you.  The torso muscle isolation is different to American culture, otherwise most of the steps to this style of dance are easily achieved.

Don't be fooled by the seeming ease of the practice.  You will have a good workout by the time you've moved through the routine she teaches.  This is a well-done teaching DVD with excellent camera work and setup as you see her and have a reflection of her in a mirror at the same time, allowing you to take in how the steps look from all sides.",1217289600,,786,4.5
1980680,4,B0001906OA,"Many people who don't like this DVD say that there is no drilling and it goes too fast. This is not a drill DVD. The point is to learn the choreography, so you need to drill as a separate exercise. If it's going too fast, then stop the DVD and practice the parts you need on your own. If you are doing the moves correctly, you will get a good work out. And if you feel there's not enough stretching, stretch on your own beforehand. It seems that those who gave this DVD a bad review were quickly frustrated when they couldn't keep up and were expected to do things on their own.

Jillina shows you the basic stance, how to do each isolation on its own, then puts them together into combinations, then puts the combinations together into the full choreography. It's a very logical setup. The choreo is entirely made up of shimmies, snake arms, hip drops, hip bumps, mayas, camels, and turns. These are all beginner moves. She stands with her back to you so you can move on the correct side as she does, and there is a mirror to her front so you can also see the front angle. Don't get what people's gripe was about standing with her back to us. If she stood the other way you'd be doing everything backwards.

Jillina's personality and choreography is a matter of taste. However, she repeatedly says you should change it to reflect YOUR OWN STYLE. She is giving you a basic choreo which you can play with as you choose. If you're a beginner you do it as it's taught and as you learn more you can go back and change it.

Overall, I really liked the setup and production quality of this DVD. It's simple, classy, and user-friendly. To get the most out of it, you need to drill on your own and not be afraid to work on portions at a time. Don't expect it to be easy if you are a beginner, but it's worth it in the end.",1216857600,,1814,4.221902017291066
1980681,2,B0001906OA,"I am an absolute beginner to bellydance and this video was not very helpful.  My biggest complaint was that the pace was very fast.  There were very few repetitions of the moves, so I was constantly hitting the rewind butting to figure out what I missed or try the move again so I could do it well.

Sections of DVD: Stretching, Traning, Combos, Dance

Pros:
Fast paced
Jillian moves as she explains so you can see various angles

Cons:
Moves are not explained very well
The basic stance is never given
The pace is very fast, with few repetitions (around 1 minute per move)
Very few stretches to warm-up
Only a few beginner moves are shown, mixed in with intermediate moves

Recap:  This is NOT a video for an absolute beginner.",1213056000,,728,4.511450381679389
1980682,4,B0001906OA,"I really enjoyed this DVD; it was fun and the technique was nice and basic, which made it easy to learn.

The only thing that threw me, was that Jillina wouldn't always include little details in her steps.

For example, during a couple of the hip isolations, Jillina doesn't mention right away that you need to bend your knees a little OR say that you can adjust your feet while doing it. Because of this, I tried doing the hip isolations while keeping my legs absolutely straight, which felt really awkward.

However, after watching her closer, I saw what she was doing and had a couple of ""OH! I get it now!"" moments.

Also, I felt she could have gone a bit slower with the combinations (since it IS supposed to be a beginner's DVD) and repeated the instructions a couple more times.

All in all though, I'm glad I bought this DVD. My friend and I had fun with it and it really does help me.",1211846400,,893,4.323353293413174
1980683,4,B0001906OA,"This is a great DVD for beginners. I bought this DVD when I had hard time to learn some things during my belly dance classes(the teacher was great, but with the DVD you can pause it, watch some parts a few times...until you get it :-))). Even my belly dance teacher could see the difference :-) I give four stars, because I don't enjoy the final choreography that much. I think it could have been more elegant and joyful, but the practice is really very good and you'll learn a lot.",1211760000,,482,4.3076923076923075
1980703,4,B0001906OA,"I really enjoyed this video. The choreography is fun and looks pretty when being performed.  It's hard to find a beginner choreography that's interesting and I found this one to be really good.  It's not a choreography that you're going to learn in a day (unless you're going to play it for hours), but it's definitely learnable for any level of dancer.

Jillina's instruction is pretty well done.  First she shows you the basic moves that you're going to need.  Absolute beginners (anyone who has never had a class) may want to go over this section several times before trying the combinations.  I like that you can see her from the back as well as in the mirror.  To me it felt more like being in an actual class and it's a million times better than videos where the instructor stands in front of you and says ""go right"" and then moves to HER right but YOUR left.  With this video when the instructor says to ""step left"", you're moving the same way that she is. I also think it's very helpful to see the instructor from the front as well as the back.  For the most part the camera is where it is supposed to be so you can see what you're supposed to be doing.  The choreo instruction is well done, you perform the section you're learning, then start from the beginning and go into the dance.  As you get to the section you've just learned she gives verbal directions in case you've forgotten anything.

On the downside, I don't care much for the ""combo/choreo"" set up.  First she teaches you a set of combinations, so you learn how to do those, but when you get to the choreography part she'll tell you to do ""Combination one"" but change X to Y.  Why not just teach sections of the dance as they're going to be performed rather than have me learn things one way and then change them out on me?  Frankly I didn't like having to retrain myself to memorize a different pattern of steps after I just went to the trouble to learn the original ones.  After the first 2 sessions with this dvd I simply skipped the combo section and concentrated on the choreography. The other downside is that the warmup section isn't long enough (which she admits in the video), I thought that was really bad form.  This is a beginner's video, why on Earth would the producers expect beginners to guess at how to properly warm up?  This section should have been done properly instead of just rushed through.

At the end is a stage performance by Jillina that has several dances, including a modified version of the one you've just learned.  While I can't say that she's the best dancer I've ever seen, I truly I enjoyed her performance, especially the drum solo.",1207612800,,2641,4.451143451143452
1980704,5,B0001906OA,I love how this breaks down choreography then slowly reconstructs it into combinations then into the full dance.  A great way to learn!,1200787200,,135,4.869565217391305
1980705,5,B0001906OA,"Upfront, this is not a dvd for absolute beginner, as everyone keeps saying. HOWEVER, mastering the techniques with proper practice is not impossible in the least bit.
Once you get the hang of the moves and cues (which  shouldn't take too long if someone is serious about learning) you feel very bellydancer-pretty.
I personally had a thrilling rush when I got everything down the first time I did the dance correctly. And even though I'm past the beginner point, I still use it to refine my moves. I would say this dvd is good for intermediate beginner, someone who doesn't have alot of experience, but is familiar with basic moves.",1187049600,,632,4.745454545454545
1980706,5,B0001906OA,"I loved this video! The music in the practice section was upbeat and fun and the instructor, Jillina, was pleasant to watch and listen to. Some instructors look mean and have irritating voices, but Jillina was very friendly looking and had a pleasant voice. The moves weren't too complicated either. She did them slower than other videos the technique section, although it was still a little too quick and short to pick up on in one try. I ended up rewinding a couple times to try again until I got it right and I also tried playing the DVD at 1/2 speed so I could observe the moves better. The only complaint I had about the video was that you couldn't always see how the moves were done because of the lighting; she wore black pants and the room was somewhat dark so it was hard to really see how her body moved some of the time. I'd recommend getting another beginner's video by someone else to go with this so you have another person to look at doing the moves that you're having a hard time with. Other than the lighting issue, the video was great! The best I've bought so far.",1185840000,,1082,4.334975369458128
1980707,4,B0001906OA,"Jillina is good at what she does....belly dancing and instructing. I bought this dvd along with 3 others and when I get the urge to practice, I pop her DVD in first. The moves are fun, and most of all she goes at a realistic speed for beginners. In other words, she doesn't make you want to ""flip off"" the tv screen.",1180310400,,316,4.112903225806452
1980708,5,B0001906OA,"I've bought several other bellydancing videos and even taken classes, but they never taught me this much or this well. Jillina's workout is perfect in that it breaks down the movements to their most basic levels. It also gives you several sets of moves that you can use to create your own, original dances. The whole DVD takes less than an hour to do, making it convenient. Moreover, Jillina's focus on using the body in correct ways has helped my improve my posture and muscle tone. I feel the movements in all the right ways and can tell I'm making progress.

THIS IS A DEFINITE GOOD BUY! When I lost my original copy of this DVD, I loved it so much that I tracked it down online. For a technophobe like me, that's a BIG deal. Worth every penny - TWICE!",1178841600,2,755,4.3546099290780145
1980709,4,B0001906OA,"This was a okay dvd.  She went over the basic guickly. I would not call this and instructonal belly dance.  I did like some of the demo and I did like the rountin.  I giving it 4 stars for effort.  It's was not the greatest dvd I have bought, but it was not a bad one either.",1174521600,3,275,3.7719298245614037
1980710,4,B0001906OA,"Jillina is a great dancer and teacher.  I would caution anyone brand new to bellydance to gather a little experience (think Neena and Veena) before taking on this DVD.  She does go a little fast, and some skipping back for a repeat is bound to happen.  Jillina does reference some other dance styles, but I didn't find it hard to figure out what she was getting at.  Her use of the mirror is handy, and I felt she explained the moves well.",1174089600,3,439,4.317073170731708
1980711,5,B0001906OA,"This dvd is definitely a workout, and you have to skip back some because she cruises through explanations pretty quickly, but it's really good if you've already learned some bellydance. The choreography is fun, and it's nice how she works through it step by step and starts from the beginning each time she's teaching you a new step so you can practice the dance up to the new moves. It's also very fun watching her performance at the end!",1173312000,4,439,4.569620253164557
1980712,5,B0001906OA,"I have learned and taught the dance on this dvd.  Its title is misleading.  It is not instructional bellydance, it is professional choreography.  This dvd is Level I in a series of 3 choreographies.

The problem with how this dvd is titled is that it does not indicate that it's a choreography, and may lead the buyer to think that it is basic instruction for someone with no prior experience in bellydance.

I have seen this dvd in Target with fitness tapes and I was surprised, because with five years of bellydance experience I knew it was not appropriate for the general audience of people wanting to explore bellydance at home.  You cannot properly execute choreographed moves from a dvd with this level of instruction, without at least taking at least a series of basic bellydance classes.

Jillina does not go into a full warm-up on the dvd as the focus is on the combinations and choreography only.  Because of the number of complex combinations before the choreographic segments and the absence of explanation of basic terms and movements, I believe that someone looking for a fitness video would be better off starting with a dvd that explains basic bellydance posture and movements, then take a class with a good instructor before trying this.

It is a good and challenging series for someone with six months or more continual training, and the next videos after the first give a student more to master after getting the first one down.  This video was marketed to bellydancers on the Bellydance Superstars tour (which Jillina choregraphed) and on their website, but the interest in the dance has allowed avenues for it to get into the general market.  Unfortunately it is not for beginners and many people may be frustrated when attempting this with no training.",1164758400,16,1774,4.841059602649007
1980733,5,B0001906OA,"I own all 3 DVD's in this series and I love Jillina's style of dance.  Her movements are so elegant and graceful - classic Raks Sharki.  She introduces some excellent choreography and combinations.  One word of caution, if you have NO classroom experience at all, this may not be the DVD for you (try Neon).",1163980800,,307,4.545454545454546
1980734,5,B0001906OA,"I wanted a video that would teach me how to bellydance, and so borrowed this one and another from the library. The other one turned out to be more of an exercise/workout video with little or no dancing, but this one exceeded my expectations. Jillina teaches you some moves, then puts them together in combinations, then puts the combinations into a whole dance routine. Its certainly not something you can master in one viewing, but with practice, you can get the hang of it pretty quickly, then its just a matter of perfecting the moves. I suggest watching yourself in a mirror to see if you're doing it right. I'm buying my own copy of this video today, and I recommend it to anyone who has no dance experience, and is looking for a good video to start with.",1163462400,2,760,4.474820143884892
1980735,5,B0001906OA,"I really enjoy the teaching technique that Jillina uses. Very easy to follow to learn the choreography. As a teaching aid I find her lessons smooth, easy to follow and at the end you know the choreography.",1162684800,,205,4.5675675675675675
1980736,4,B0001906OA,"I have been bellydancing for 6-7 years, off and on; taken classes from a couple different teachers and own about a dozen bellydance DVD's, and I have to admit that this is not for the beginner. The positive points to this DVD are: 1)great technique, Jillina does an excellent job of showing you combinations and putting them together to do a basic dance, 2)she shows how to do the ""camel"" move, I haven't seen every DVD out there, but this one will teach you to do that great move.  The less positive points: 1)she has some standing stretching poses that are very advance, if you don't take yoga or aren't a classically trained dancer, they could be very challenging, 2) she doesn't know her anatomy, you pull in with your obliques not your hip flexors and you stretch your quadriceps not your hamstrings. I gave this 4 stars because if you already know the basic moves to bellydance, this is a fun DVD to learn a basic dance that looks good and is a little challenging. If you are looking to just learn some basic moves, I recommend the Neena and Veena sets before this one.",1162598400,2,1075,4.48469387755102
1980737,4,B0001906OA,I'd say this is more of an advanced beginner dvd. Jillina goes through the moves very quickly. But it is fun to do once you get more familiar with the choreography.,1160352000,,164,4.32258064516129
1980738,3,B0001906OA,"Great DVD if you are: a) already a trained dancer in a Western style looking for something challenging b)in shape and able to pick up dance moves at phenomenal speed c) a belly dancer looking for a refresher in cabaret style d) in a belly dance class looking for something to help you practice

For the rest of us, I will agree with those reviewers who cautioned that this is not a DVD for beginners, no matter what the title says. Sure, if you have 2 hours a day, 7 days a week to devote to practice and are particularly patient, you could probaby master the moves, but there are much better (more comprehensive, better taught, cheaper) alternatives to what is being covered in this DVD.

Here are some of my complaints:

The instructions are very non specific (""release your hip"", stand with your feet ""inside your shoulders""-How much inside? Hip width? More? Are the legs almost closed? No way of knowing.)

Conflicting instructions. (""Don't move your shoulders"" while her shoulders are snaking around all over the place)

Cross referencing to other dance types (Plie stretching? Making someone stand on the balls of their feet? How many people who buy this DVD course will be ballet trained?)

No focus. The moves are very briefly demonstrated and you are hurried from one to the next after a few seconds of practice. You will have to rewind constantly to get a closer look at her feet, arms, hips, and legs. This was probably the only way to fit everything in a DVD with limited time for each segment, but it's very irritating, and not helpful to someone who is new to the movements.

Camera and setting. Very, very distracting. The camera zooms in on her navel when it should be focusing on her legs.

Style. This is, very specifically, Egyptian Cabaret belly dancing-not the end all be all of belly dancing. For instance, Jillina is constantly asking that you do not bend your legs too much and keep them fair straight. This is not the case for most basic belly dance moves, the standard position is standing with the feet apart and the knees bent. She doesn't mention this, and demands most moves be done with straight legs. This is fine, but it's a highly specific way of dancing; and it should be made clear that not everyone does things this way.

Jillina is, without question, well versed in her field. This is why this DVD is getting 3 stars instead of one.

There's really not much else I can say that's positive about this DVD, except perhaps that the coreography uses the movements taught in the first part of the session in a way that's fun to follow-if you can get through the first half without being frustrated by bad instruction and awkward positions.

In short, this is fine for someone who already has-or is in the process of learning-the foundations of movement. If you are an absolute beginner and want to learn belly dance, there are better DVD's than this.",1155945600,14,2883,4.633333333333334
1980739,5,B0001906OA,"I agree that the instructions are brief but I love Jillina's routine. I learn best when I'm working on a routine, and I don't mind rewinding it if it inspires me. The way Jillina shows you the steps you can see very clearly how the movements are performed. You have to practice on your own anyway even you had an entire dvd's worth of drills. When you practice you can't look at the screen all the time, you'll have to see yourself in the mirror and check what you are doing against the routine on the dvd, and you need to start at your own pace, and learn the steps so that you can do them fast enough to keep up with the music. Fitness videos don't do much for me because I need to stop and do every new move very slowly on my own.",1154908800,3,733,4.027397260273973
1980740,1,B0001906OA,"This was the worst bellydancing video I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. She spends more time dancing in front of the mirror idolizing herself than she does instructing the viewers on how to perform the routine. You constantly have to rewind and rewind and rewind some more to practice the moves. She only spends a few seconds on each move.

P.S. If I would have been allowed to I would NOT have given it a star but the system did not let me proceed without rating it.. I give it a double thumbs down. This was simply HORRID.",1154476800,12,533,4.33
1980741,5,B0001906OA,"I've grown to like Jillian's dvd after reviewing many others.  I like the choreography section a lot.  Yes, it may take true beginners a while to master the moves, but if you've had some instruction from a real teacher, it should not be a problem. In fact, for beginners with previous instruction, the combinations section might be a waste of time because the combinations in this part of the dvd are slightly different from the combinations taught in the choreography section.  Dancers who are familiar with the moves will benefit most from the instruction on the choreography. If you're looking to learn a quick, sexy routine, then this dvd will deliver greatly!",1153872000,,664,4.910714285714286
1980742,1,B0001906OA,"I got this on sale for $2, and even at that price, found it worthless. She only teases you, showing the moves very briefly and instructing very frugally. Then... she just dances, and dances, and dances, expecting you to be able to follow her! Maybe it would be OK for Level 10, but why call it ""Level 1""? By the way, for ANY level it would be barely OK, since her cameraman doesn't know his job.",1153699200,11,395,4.2105263157894735

Nourhan Sharif:  An Introduction to Bellydance Technique. I feel her technique is more akin to Egyptian classical bellydancers I have  come to admire.

After learning with Nourhan's dvd, I looked at Jillina's and found that she did certain moves much differently than Nourhan.

That being said, it is still a good dvd for beginning bellydancing enthusiasts.",1151971200,3,467,4.691358024691358

I am completely new to belly dancing and this was the first dvd i've ever bought on the subject.  this video teaches you the basic moves with some explanation.  The other reviewers said that she moved too quickly, which is true, jiliana does go through the moves at a relatively fast pace, but thats what the rewind button is for.  I feel that perhaps the first few times you watch this, you may need to go back and repeat a section, but the instruction is clear and the conciseness of it will be helpful once you're more comfortable with the moves and want to go back and brush up or polish skills.",1149897600,5,648,4.330578512396694
1980757,1,B0001906OA,"The title is terribly misleading. A better title would be ""Jillina's combinations"".

With respect to the break-down of bellydance moves, Jillina offers only a very fast-paced review. There is no drilling whatsoever. If this is your first bellydance instruction, you'll feel like a student who happened to miss the entire course and now is attending a review session before the exam. Jillina's explanations are rushed, and not always clear.

I think the best instructional (and practice) video is ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"". Or, if you need a very, very gentle introduction to bellydance, get ""Amira's bellydance 101"". I also recommend ""Bellydance for Romance"" for inspiration. Even ""Discover bellydance"" series with all their flaws are a million times better then Jillina's DVD.

Most of the time Jillina dedicates to assembling moves into dance combos. And that disproportionately large part I found to be even worse than her instruction:
1. I prefer to combine the moves by myself. It wasn't nice of Jillina to use this DVD to show off her choreography instead of teaching the technique.
2. Each sequence she first demonstrates without music. This makes it a chore. (The other programs that I mentioned above never stop the music while teaching their short routines, which makes them much more fun to learn.)
3. Whenever the music is back, there is another disappointment: Jillina constantly shouts out the names of the movements or - even worse - counts. (Instructors on the DVD's that I mentioned above never yell at you).
4. I don't find Jillina's choreography interesting.

Moreover, I was surprised they didn't hire a professional to shoot this video. The camera is shaking; most of the time Jillina is shot from a wrong angle, far away, and poorly lit. Though by itself the idea of using a mirror was great, it was not successfully realized, since her reflection is hard to see due to the distance and dim light.

And I didn't like Jillina's personality at all. Extremely cold, dry, and bland.",1149465600,7,2008,5.018018018018018
1980758,4,B0001906OA,"I have never done bellydance before, have no background in it, and have never seen it done before, so I was excited to get this dvd. She does a pretty good job of explaining what she's doing, and i'm sure i'll eventually catch on, but I can't say I was too thrilled with her instruction for the basic fact that she made it seem like I was suppose to just magically ""get it"" and do what she was doing. I wish she would have taken it a little slower and spent slightly more time on each move, because as the title says ""LEVEL 1"" and I am BRAND new to it, I needed more instruction.  I gave it 4 stars though, because I do think that once I spend more time with it, it will be a great video to learn from, and the stuff she teaches will always be something I can benefit from. GREAT dvd, just not as ""Level 1""ish as I would have hoped.",1148860800,,832,3.9820359281437128
1980759,5,B0001906OA,"I really liked this DVD because she teaches you the techniques (basic moves with their so-called names)and then the combinations which will lead you to the choreography (slidly different). She goes rather quickly explaining the moves but don't worry , you just stop the DVD, press rewind and play it again. The best part comes when you watch her performing and then you realize that the same thing she's doing was taught to you. So you can finally dance on your own a complete song with its coreography !! I liked it so much that I have already bought Level 2 and 3. I'll tell you how they are when I receive them and practice a bit ! See you, Caro.",1147996800,2,649,4.371900826446281

I love how each section builds on the one before it. I'm still working on the Technique section, but I've watched through the whole process and I am very impressed.

She makes it easy for me to understand her moves and the mirror in the background really does help you see what she's doing from all angles. This woman really knows how to teach. I fully intend on buying levels 2 & 3 when I'm finished with level 1.",1147824000,,531,4.196078431372549
1980761,5,B0001906OA,"This is an excellent instructional dvd for a beginning (not a total novice) dancer that knows the basic moves & is ready to form combinations & a full dance routine.  For anyone that's a total novice, i recommend The Dance, Volume 1 by Carrie Konya.  Carrie covers pretty much all the basic moves from the figue 8's, hip sways, hip twist, hip shimmie, chest slides & circle, undulation, belly rolls & flutters, head slides, veils & a few other things! Wow that was a ""mouth-full"" of moves! I bought it a few months back & it was pricy, like $40 or $44, but its $30 now & a really recommend it if your just  beginning.

After mastering the basic moves, definetly try Jillina's level 1 dvd thata teaches you most of what Carrie's dvd does, but Jillina combines those moves into a full dance & I love that!  The music is great & her dancing is awsome!  I did also buy her level 3 dvd, but the moves taught in the technique part aren't all that great, but the combinations are nice & her ending performance is nice too.  But I still like her level 1 more :o)

Also Neon's dvd's are pretty good. She provides alot of moves as well, but I don't like her combinations because, unlike Jillina, there not that of a mid-eastern belly dancer, but she teaches all moves nicely & easily.

Well I do hope this was of some help & good luck dvd hunting :o)",1145923200,2,1340,4.306772908366534
1980762,5,B0001906OA,"I am also a beginner of Belly Dance, & I really love this dvd.  This is a LEVEL 1 dvd & she teaches so well f0r me.  Jillina shows you two angles of the 'how to's' for her steps.  She has the camera angled behind her, and she is facing a mirror, so I can see from behind how to do the steps & also from the front as well.  She does the steps with additional steps over & over, so you don't forget the first ones that you learned.  I do best that way with remembering what step comes next.  She also shows you the dance in a performance at the end of the dvd.  She shows you that you can add these steps to other performances & now I have learned how to adlib a little better without feeling like I 'messed up'.  I know alot of people that I read about online don't like the idea of dancing for your husband, but, I love to perform for my husband ONLY.  This isn't something to just try to be 'sexy', (although it sure helps), but it's an art that I only feel comfortable performing for him.  This was my Valentine's Day solo for him.  I now have bought her level II and III.  Thanks Jillina for an excellent dvd!",1145664000,3,1112,3.981900452488688
1980792,3,B0001906OA,This is a good way for beginners to start. It teaches a few basic moves and 1 routine. I like watching Jillina perform but didn't get as much instruction as I was hoping for. I'm a beginner myself and was looking for more in way of technique and moves. I ended up having to buy a few more DVDs that provided a larger range of teaching.,1141257600,14,335,4.090909090909091
1980793,5,B0001906OA,"Jillina does an excellent job of breaking down the choreography and building on it.  It is a great workout the whole time, even if you don't get all the way through the choreography!  My one complaint is that her section on technique is not very thorough.  She barely touches on the Camel and I'm not very good at it: I need a lot more practice than her instruction provides!  I also expected that the final track, ""Performance,"" would provide more direct coaching about the presentation of the routine, instead it is her dancing the routine with her own embellishments to the point that I was not even sure if it was the same dance.  Keep in mind, I am a novice belly dancer.  Regardless, the choreography is varied and exciting to perform!  This gives you a routine that you can perform for your loved ones!  ~And the movement is fun & sexy!  I love it!",1140998400,8,855,4.464516129032258
1980794,4,B0001906OA,"This tape is great fun.  It takes multiple watches to get the moves that Jillina is teaching but once you get through each part of the choreography, it is very rewarding.  It helps to practice in front of a mirror to see if you are getting the moves.  Jillina does not explain the moves in great detail at all, but practice mimicing the moves in the mirror and eventually helps you get the moves down.",1140998400,4,401,4.32

1980796,3,B0001906OA,"While I love watching Jillina dance, I found it hard to follow along with her instruction as she is too fast.  I watched it twice and did the techniques section twice, but did not attempt the combinations as I feel I need to master the basics before moving on.  I thought that a beginner DVD would focus more on learning the basics and I don't think this DVD does.  I bought it to supplement my weekly bellydance classes.  Being a relatively quick learner, I bought it based on reviews and ignored others who said that it was not for beginners.  I have to admit that they are right.  This tape is much more suited to advanced beginners.  I am sure that I will use this tape once I get more experience (have only had two classes), but for now I will be checking out other ""Level 1"" instructional DVDs and will report my findings.",1137888000,13,828,4.337662337662338
1980797,5,B0001906OA,"This video is a great starter to the world of belly dancing.  She takes it step by step.  However, after you learn the routine she gives you, take these moves and apply them to other songs.  You'll find after doing this tape how much easier it is to feel the music and move to it.

the only con I had with this video was that I couldn't find the song anywhere.",1135123200,5,360,4.028169014084507
1980798,4,B0001906OA,"Overall I found this to be a good DVD. Jillina starts out by going through basic moves. She does an excellent job of describing how to do them and demostrating. But she does move through this section a bit quickly. But you can always back it up and watch it again.

She then moves on to a combinations section. She teaches various ways to combine basic moves.

She then moves on to the choreography. She uses a lot of the stuff she taught in the combination section. She goes through it verbally and slowly at first, then does it to music.

She ends with a beautiful performance of the choreography and throws in a bit extra.

Overall a great DVD to start out with. I will admit it is a bit easier to follow if you have some experience under your belt. But this is still a better DVD than most beginner dvds I've seen.",1134345600,6,818,4.258064516129032
1980799,3,B0001906OA,"Update 12/19/2011:  Someone commented on my review to say that nowhere does this DVD say it is for Beginners.  The commenter is correct.  It doesn't say ""beginner"" anywhere on the DVD... ANYMORE.  This DVD has been renamed since I wrote my review (in 2005!!) to reflect more accurately what you are getting.  I do, however, stand by my original statement that there is not enough detailed instruction on this DVD.  Lots of people have only DVDs to learn from...even calling it ""Level 1"" suggests something lower level than what you are actually getting.  Get a different DVD if you are a beginner and just starting out.  Once you lay down some groundwork, then get this for the very lovely piece of choreography Jillina teaches.

Original Review:
The title of this DVD is shockingly misleading.  This is NOT for the beginner!!  One of the most important things in bellydancing is that you keep the correct posture at all times so that you do not injure your lower back and Jillina doesn't really mention that and it's THE FIRST thing you'll learn in a class.  Please don't make the mistake of buying this as an instructional video if you are just starting out.  All Jillina is doing on this DVD is teaching you some nice looking choreography without any in depth explanations how to. There is NOT enough instruction or drilling.  I love Jillina, she's a beautiful dancer...so don't get me wrong on that score.  This is simply not good instruction for a beginner.  At all.  If you are looking for instruction similar to a class, go on the net and find Halyma or Amira (Amira is sometimes available on Amazon).  Trust me on this.  I've only been able to afford a few classes so far and DVDs are my main source of instruction at the moment.  I am a complete beginner.  I will use this DVD later on for fun and to get a feel for how to put moves together, but save your money for something else if you are looking for pure instruction.",1133136000,71,1931,4.555232558139535
1980800,4,B0001906OA,"I've been dancing in the tribal & cabaret styles for about 13 years, so I've seen a number of videos and taken many classes. This DVD is great for only about 15$, and I plan on buying the next 2 levels as well.

Jillina starts with some breakdowns of basic moves (I reccommend a good warmup & stretch session before you push play), and then turns them into combinations, walking though each move pretty thoroughly. She does a number of repititions with just her voice, and then some to music. The combinations are extensive, and this is a good DVD to use as a workout just by going through the combinations alone.

Next, she performs variations on the combinations, walking you through each one. Once again, she does many reps with her coaching, and then many reps to music. Last, she wraps them all up into one choreography. The great thing about this is that you really see how moves go together to create a dance. Making some of these moves second nature will really improve your improvisational skills.

The last section of the DVD is a performance with a live audience, which was excellent. You see most of the moves that she taught in the combinations, and realize that you can do them now yourself, if you practice.

Now, I would NOT reccommend this for someone who has never done any belly dance. Take a class near you first. The nurturing and learning atmosphere will do you good. Also, you'll learn how to do these moves without injuring yourself. You'll have an instructor who can see you and help you out when you get in a jam. Then, take your moves you learned in class an apply them here.

I have to say that I am apalled by the egyptian shimmy that Jillina uses... it's only good for destroying your knees! Learn to do the move properly (in a class), and use the correct move in place of her shimmy. You'll get farther that way!

On the whole, I'm glad I bought this video, though! It's the best one for cabaret I've seen, and you truly do get a feel for choreographed pieces. Note: do not perform this choreography in public. Come up with your own! The moves are varied enough to do that easily!",1131840000,6,2111,4.455958549222798
1980801,5,B0001906OA,"Before I got this DVD I had 3 others by other belly dance artists. This is great because it cleared up a lot of questions that I had regarding moves that were not explained in the other videos. Jillina breaks everything down for you bit by bit and explains the right and wrong way to do things, plus she turns and gives you various angles so that you know that YOU are doing it right. She even breaks down the dance routine, which is lengthy, into smaller parts so you can learn it bit by bit. I often practice one combination, then when I'm comfortable with knowing it I move on to the next combination. There are no surprises with this one, which is perfect for beginners or anyone learning to belly dance! :)",1130716800,3,711,4.313432835820896
1980841,1,B0001906OA,"I found this dvd really boring.  I'm not really sure if it was useful... dance is supposed to be fun-- and you usually get a workout when you dance (really dance)*  I've done lots of ballet and jazz-- a little bit of tap in the past...  I love going out dancing.  I'm currently doing latin dance.  I decided to give this a try--- and I got no workout.. I felt like I was just standing around wasting time. o_O

I hated watching Jillina.... I thought this might have meant I hated belly dancing. I ordered Discover Bellydance-- It turned out to be a better series.  I still don't like bellydance.. but Neena and Veena (cheesy.. yes) were much more graceful and easy on the eyes.  Not to mention-- their instruction was way better-- I wasn't looking at their backside (as I was with Jilliana) during the majority of learning how to do things.

Maybe I'm just into the bright colors and art of seduction through dance. I think something else is probably for me. This was too slow. I've taken multiple dance courses in the past-- ballet, jazz, latin, hip hop. Sluggish instruction is a waste of time.",1130371200,3,1096,4.494949494949495

I have been practicing now for a couple of weeks; I intend to continue practicing - the moves aren't as easy as they look. I'm looking forward to buying the levels 2 and 3. Jillina seems to be a good instructor; although I would recommend trying various instructors because they each have they're unique style in some moves. I'm having lots of fun with learning to belly dance - my husband is happy, too!:)",1128729600,2,510,4.4361702127659575
1980844,5,B0001906OA,"Being an intermediate dancer, I bought all three of Jillina's dance DVDs. It was a pleasure to see a DVD that focuses on dancing rather than the more common ( and IMVHO) boring belly-aerobics videos. Even the beginner's one is excellent for revision of technique and her combinations are both creative and challenging. the video is well set up and easy to rewind to tha appropriate place if you want to repeat a point. And an added bonus is that one gets a similar aerobic workout compared to the competitors.

A minor quibble is that on occasions the camera does not allow one to see her footwork

Finally she shows you the result of your hard work in a live performance. My bellydance friends are getting these videos ( and a region free DVD player because sadly these are not available in region 4 :-( )",1127001600,3,806,4.513698630136986

All Good !",1125792000,4,451,4.255813953488372
1980846,4,B0001906OA,I liked her breakdown of moves as well as how she repeated everything.  However I wish that she would have given the same attention to teaching the footwork.  Also the camera work made it difficult in the later segments when she is altering the combinations.  Now I could keep up with most of it but at times the camera would (finally) focus on her feet while she was adding a new movement of the hips (I think).  Eventhough I was left feeling very frustrated I did like the DVD.  In future versions maybe they could include a booklet that breaks down the steps and a CD of the song the coreography goes to.,1125619200,,607,4.336283185840708
1980847,5,B0001906OA,"To start with you should know that I am not good with choreography and often find myself lost. I am a good dancer but not well with following others.

Now saying that I will go on. First it is broken down into five chapters (which you get to chose at the menu option). Stretching, Technique, combinations, choreography, and performance.

Stretching is nice becuase you will find that lots of videos start with out and you often have to do them yourself.

The technique is great she starts with no music simply teaching you the steps and she does them slow (in a step by step method) then moves to show you how they flow. This is the learning the steps part. But wait thats not all. The fist time she does this is with out the music. Then she shows you how to use it with the music.

Combinations... she shows you how to combing the moves you have learned and puts them together but unlike most she will reshow you the steps then combine them. Once again with out the music then with.

Choreography is like the next step to say. Now you put the combos you have learned together and to the music.

Performance is her with the music showing you how it should look.

Some extras about this video. It is just her no distractions

She shows you all angles from front to side how is should look

she shows you commen mistake that people make when learning

she does this infront of a mirror. so you can see what it looks like from front to back

she also make sure when teaching she is facing you . then while you are doing it to the music she faces the  mirror. this way you are not confused by her facing the opposite way and don't move the wrong way but yet still can see her in the mirror. It is just great all around!",1125532800,11,1715,4.2110091743119265
1980848,4,B0001906OA,I love the way the dance is broken down into small sections. Before you know it you are doing the whole dance.,1124668800,3,110,4.045454545454546
1980849,5,B0001906OA,"I am definatly a fan of jillina I have taken workshops with her and own both of her IAMED videos that cost $45 each.  I am an experienced dancer and have been dancing for over 5 years I can keep up with her drum solo at the end of the tape so I can't say how easy it will be for a beginner to catch on to this tape.  Even though it is the beginner level of her series it is my favorite tape because the combinations are easy to memorize so that you can use them to improvise to a wide variety of music, the song used in the choreography is more traditional and suitable to a performance in a middle eastern resturant where they want music that matches the atmosphere, and her perfomance at the end shows you how you can adapt the choreography for a real performance.  In her performance you will notice how she takes bigger step sometimes to better present her self to the audience she may also add extra shimmies of slightly change the combinations for example she substitutes  a 3/4 shimy for a shoulder shimmy.  The drum solo at the end is really fun to practice to I love drum solos.",1124323200,2,1087,4.206730769230769
1980850,4,B0001906OA,"I bought this dvd because I thought it would be a fun workout.  As it turns out, the instructor gives an excellent demonstration of the movements- with various angles shown- but she only does the movement for a few seconds with no workout routine until all moves are learned, so don't find it useful for a workout.",1124064000,5,314,4.508771929824562
1980861,4,B0001906OA,"I enjoyed this dvd.  I must admit, when I first saw her dance I did not think she was as talented as others that I have seen.  However, I like the choreography that she did.  It is not so simple that you are immediately bored with it, and it is not so hard that it takes weeks to master each move.

This is certainly not a total beginner's dvd.  It takes a little knowledge of bellydance and a little coordination to keep up with her.  I guess you could always rewind it over and over again if you are having trouble.

Overall, pretty good job.  I even broke a sweat when I first started learning it.",1123718400,6,600,4.112068965517241

Luckily I have taken some classes or I would have been so lost! I did like the way that you get to learn an actual dance, where she breaks down the combos. The music is good too. Overall this tape is best for dancers who are beginners but have some experience belly dancing.",1123027200,15,423,4.435897435897436

1980864,5,B0001906OA,"I bought this DVD as well as Level 2 & 3 and had my friend carry it all the way from the US to Indonesia. It was worth it though!

The DVD is set up so you can practice the different moves Jillina uses in the choreography. She also demonstrates step by step the different combinations to make up the dance. The photography and lay-out is great. You can see her back as well as her front from a mirror.

I liked this DVD more than others because not only does it teach you new moves, but it also incorporates the moves in a new dance. Most instructional DVD's are purly technique and does not have a choreography portion. By the end of this DVD, you have learned a whole dance rountine from top to bottom.

One thing though, this DVD is not for the absolute beginner to bellydance. Unless you have a dance background. Totally worth it. I hope she makes another instructional/dance choreography DVD.",1122249600,3,897,4.391566265060241

1980866,5,B0001906OA,"This is the best instructional DVD I own (I have TONS) for teaching the moves and for putting them together into useable combinations.  The combinations are not easy, however, and they may be very challenging for an absolute beginner.

The thing that makes this my absolute favorite is that Jillina demonstrates the combinations with her back turned to the camera so that you can mimick her actions exactly, without having to think about whether that's her right or left leg she's moving.  The camera shows a full-body shot of her and never zooms in for dramatic close-ups during the combinations, so you always know exactly what her other foot is doing, etc.  The performance parts include lots of interesting camera angles, but the instructional segments don't and I like that.  It helps to minimize confusion.

In all, I thought this video was excellent, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning bellydance.",1121299200,3,923,5.0
1980867,4,B0001906OA,"I don't know much about belly dancing but this seems like a descent place to start. She teaches a hand full of moves then puts them together into a choreographed dance. If you learn all of the moves well and are creative I'm sure you could make up your own routine as well but your going to need to watch this tape multiple times to get all of the moves down, it takes some practice. This defiantly is a level one video/DVD but I'm sure if you went up through the levels of her tapes you would learn to dance pretty well.",1120694400,,521,4.117647058823529
1980868,5,B0001906OA,"I've got a lot of tapes and DVDs for bellydance instruction, soI had to try this one, too. At first I was reluctant to plop down more coin on another DVD when I wasn't sure I would like it, but this one is exactly what I had wanted to find for a long, long time.
I've had lessons before, just community enrichement classes that left me sorely disappointed, and Jillina tops that experience by a long shot and everything I've run into prior to this DVD (and volumes 2 and 3 are just as good too).
She starts out with some stretching, then breaks down the moves, runs through technique and has you repeat some steps and combos a few times to get them down. This one has seven 'breakdowns' and you repeat each part a number of times, eventually to music.
Then she runs through choreography, adding a bit more layering and flair to the steps you learned. And as you go along you realize you're doing the dance she has at the end (where she performs in costume, though that one is a bit different, modified, so she says, for the stage, but you can see her doing the moves she just taught you).
I love that in the instruction and choreography she shows the moves in front of a mirror, so you see her from the front and back, and she's very clear about how to move, which way to step (step left and turn to your right, etc). It's not terribly complicated but not so easy either that you'll get bored fast. I'm having a lot of fun with this DVD and I love volumes two and three (which grow in complexity) and only wish there were more Jillinas teaching out in the dance/DVD world.
Some people love this DVD and others hate it, and I can understand both points of view, but I like the progression of showing individual moves (hip circles, omis, camels, etc) and building of the moves while in front of the mirror, and I love that she doesn't just dive into something without explanation. To me she comes across as a great teacher, and it's fun to work on the moves and feel it coming together more and more. I only wish other instructional DVDs would break down moves and weave together a dance. The only other one I've run into with this is the bellytwins' introduction to bellydance series, and Jillina (for me) gives a more satisfying chance to dance and with better music.",1119398400,5,2267,4.349056603773585

It was very helpfull to see both sides of a move at the same time and there were quite a few moves that i did not know, being a new belly dancer when i got this. I do agree with some of the reviewers that it is NOT a BEGINNER DVD, as it does seem to go over the steps rather quickly for a brand new belly dancer.
I also think that jillina was a little bland and stiff. You can tell she has had extensive dance training in the past, but she dosen't seem to come across as enjoying what she is doing.
As a beginner dancer, i learned a couple of different kinds of shimmys- none of which Jillina uses in this video. So for the longest time i thought she was a crappy shimmy-er, but now that i know there are lots of different shimmys i can tell she's good at the shimmy she uses. (So if you are a new dancer and she is different from your teacher, or other video, or if you just don't like her shimmy, there are other shimmys out there for you to learn! i know 5 now, and there are more out there.)
So over all, I will keep this DVD for learning and going over combinations and for exercise, but I was not all THAT impressed with Jillinas' over all style to by more of her tapes.",1115596800,12,1272,4.011811023622047
1980870,5,B0001906OA,"I was hesitant about buying this DVD, or any others, because of the reputation a lot of bellydancing videos have: the choreography isn't explained well, the leg-work isn't shown, the zooming in on the stomach, and many dances are not organized to blend together so well. My sister bought this and I watched it and was blown away! The next day I ordered the Level 2 and 3 DVDs. Reasons why it's great:

1. Jillina is talented and knows what she's doing.

2. The quality and tone of her voice. You can clearly understand what she's saying and she does a good job explaining the moves.

3. The dance moves shown can help give you a routine.

4. It's enjoyable to watch whether you'll be actively participating in learning the dances or not.

5. It's not vulgar. It's not embarassing to own, like some of the old bellydancing videos from overseas. She's classy and elegant. There are no boobs coming out everywhere so you're not distracted from the lessons. She wears tight pants to help u see the legwork.

6. She does a spectacular 3-part performance in the end (wears a beautiful costume) which brings a lot of what she shows you together and gives you an idea of what u can do by yourself once u've mastered it, which is inspiring enough to continue to learn.

7. I love Warda so I'm glad she chose to incorporate her music in one of the combinations. She uses great, energetic, and upbeat music. Some of it is found on the ""Bellydance Superstars"" CD, which I sampled on Amazon and it's great.

8. It's modern. It shows how bellydancing has evolved. The costumes are better, the choreography is better organized, and it shows that u don't have to have outrageous curves to be  a bellydancer. You can be skinny, average, or curvacious. You just need a lot of energy, but don't be discouraged if u feel tired. When I watched this I was a little fatigued and stressed, but it got me up and trying to do the movies. Bellydancing takes practice and dedication. It doesn't matter what your race is Arabian, White, Latina, Black, etc...anyone can learn.

9. If u wanna get down like Shakira, learn some new moves before u go to a ""hafla"" (party), or u wanna get urself energized & feelin' sexy, then bellydancing is the way to do it.

10. I've been dancing since I was 12 years old so I know that a beginner has to work on the hip work and moving the midsection, stomach, waist, all of that. Once u have that down, this DVD will be a synch. Repitition is the key. AND MAKE SURE YOU DO A PROPER WARMUP, LONGER THAN THE SHORT ONE SHE SHOWS YOU. Running in place for 2 minutes before stretching always works for me b/c it gets the blood going and heart pumping.

1980913,4,B0001906OA,"I've got the box set and I love it. A little difficult to follow the instructions. I had to turn down the speed on my dvd. I also sometimes think Jillina uses music that is to fast to really have the time to do the different moves, she even cuts corners here and there herself too.",1114300800,2,281,4.035714285714286
1980914,5,B0001906OA,"I began buying bellydance DVDs online to add some variety/fun to my workouts.  As someone who does not have easy access to an instructor, my only opportunity to learn comes through the multitude of DVDs I have bought.

The instruction for each of the techniques is clearly explained and well demonstrated from more than one angle by Jillina.  However, unless you have had previous experience with bellydance or are a very quick learner, it will take multiple viewings of the broken down choreography before you can even hope to mimic her graceful dancing.

People who aren't comfortable with improvising in bellydance will learn a complete routine from beginning to end- first by individual technique, then through broken down segments, and finally with the opportunity to perform the entire dance.  When you see Jillina's performance at the beginning, you will know it is worth it to keep practicing over and over again.

I highly recommend this DVD, but don't expect it to be easy to follow along after only a few viewings.  Fortunately, it is enjoyable enough that most people won't mind watching it and practicing repeatedly.",1113523200,6,1129,5.037634408602151
1980915,5,B0001906OA,"I have studied middle eastern dance off and on for the past four years. I also walk 4-5 miles a day.  I had a hard time keeping up and I already knew the moves.  Great tape. fantastic workout but not for the beginer or faint of heart.  If you have mastered Rania's other tapes, (or Neena and Veenas', also wonderful) then give it a shot, Personally I love it but I would not if I had been introduced to it as a novice.",1109894400,8,418,4.0120481927710845
1980916,4,B0001906OA,"Like a previous reviewer, I'm giving this video 4 stars out of 5, mainly because I think its a little too fast for a real, honest-to-goodness beginner.  I bought it to brush up on basic moves after a 3 years hiatus from belly dancing and it had me lost in a few spots... I can imagine it would outpace someone who has never so much as shimmied!

That being said, it is a great video nonetheless.  I really love the way its been filmed, with Jillina situated before a mirror so you get a good view of her entire body and how it moves in relationship to the movements.  And Jillina's legs, the most important part of belly dancing, are in full view.  I just wish someone would learn that you can't do close-ups in instructional videos!  Although close-up shots are minimal, there are a few places where the cinematographer gets a little creative and zooms in on Jillina's beautiful stomach while we're supposed to be seeing what her legs are doing.  Highly frustrating, but less of a problem than in other belly dance videos I've seen.

The breakdown of steps and building up of a routine is fantastic.  It gives someone starting out a good idea of how to combine the moves and makes you feel as though you have gained something for all your hard work.  Other dance videos show you the basics but don't do much in the way of showing you how they go together.  Someone could theoretically buy this DVD and have a beautiful routine they could perform at a hafla or restaurant.  Of course, they'd have to practice like crazy to get the steps right, but it definitely gives more ""bang"" for the buck.

In short, I'm glad I purchased this DVD.",1108512000,16,1635,4.446308724832215

1980919,4,B0001906OA,"This dvd provides works to build a nice dance routine at the end.  However, it is not easy to follow for a beginner.

The instruction section moves through the movements much too quickly for a novice.  Jillina only shows the movements 4-8 times.  She doesn't breakdown how to perform some of the motions.

I recommend this dvd to a beginner with some other dance training or someone with some other bellydance experience.  A novice to bellydance will probably have to review the instructional section several times before understanding some of the movements.

I have used other bellydance dvds as well as taken classes.  In some of the instructional portion, I was struggling to figure out what movement Jillina was using.  (Most bellydancers use the different names for the steps.  Unlike ballet or such, they don't have uniform names for the moves.)

However, the dvd does build a terrific routine.  It breakdowns the different segments.  In some cases however, she does run through the multiple movements too fast & without enough cues for a beginner.

I do wish there were a segment with the music so you could do the entire routine through without any prompting.  The last time through has the prompting for segment 7.

It is clear Jillina is an experienced dancer and enjoys bellydance.  That makes the dvd all the more enjoyable to perform.  Her three dance routines at the end are a pleasure to watch.

Overall, I would recommend this dvd.  Though I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction for a novice.  I might use ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners - Basic Moves"" as they go over the movements in greater detail and break them down better.  Other than that, this is a terrific dvd.",1108339200,11,1692,4.822299651567945

1980921,5,B0001906OA,"And I have seen quite a few.  I have been bellydancing for two years and have taken classes with a variety of live instructors, seen bellydancing live a number of times, danced in student shows, and done several of the videos on the market (Neena and Veena, Rania, etc).  Jillina's instructional video is terrific, although I'm not sure how easy it would be for beginners.  For a road-warrior who needs to take her dance practice into a hotel room, it's been great.

Jillina's workout is separated into several parts.  There is a technique section, where you really practice individual moves.  I found this section almost as good as a classroom teaching environment.  Then, you learn combinations.  The combinations are drilled in, both without and with the music.  The combinations are creative, challenging, and yet repeated enough that even I could learn them.

Finally, the combinations with variations are taught in a complete choreography.  Jillina has a great sense of musicality, as the rhythms and trills of the music are perfectly matched by the moves.  This really made the choreography sink in and ""make sense"" to me.  I also enjoyed putting together a full dance piece.

Jillina also includes a video of her performing this choreography for a live audience.  It was so beautiful, it took my breath away.  Yet, as you watch it, you also recognize the very same moves that you learned in her video.  It's extremely inspiring.",1101772800,224,1436,4.941422594142259

The only possible caveat is that this presentation is not for absolute beginners: this choreography and the terminology Jillina uses show that a certain level of dance training is a prerequisite for taking full advantage of this video.  Even so, the presentation is clear and complete enough that even a relative beginner could learn the material presented if one studies and practices enough.",1378857600,,637,5.34

I have only one complaint on this dvd, but unfortunately, it's a major problem: she has 7 combinations, but there is no way to click on each one. so they are all seven in one chapter. so you can't pick number 3 for example and click on it to practice just that one over and over. you have to rewind. it is very slow and annoying.and I think her combos are complicated enough to need to learn and practice each one separately over and over. so. she has a ton of great stuff on here, but the way they made the dvd, it's very time wasting to access just one combo. so i ended up not really doing it. cause it was too annoying to find the one I wanted. Because of this one little problem, the enjoyability of the video went way down. I think they should re-release the whole set and fix this problem.

8008394,3,B0001906OA,"I am glad that I got this one from the library and it is going right back.  I don't think the video is horrible nor is her instruction, but I think dancing videos are just not for me.  I am young and coordinated, but catching dance moves without a teacher there to correct your move is seeming to be more and more of a bad idea if you aren't one who gets dance moves easily.  I felt like some of the moves could hurt you because you may pull something.  I chose not to finish it.  The warm up in the beginning felt great.  The stretches felt so good to me.  Usually warm ups suck but this one didn't.  If you are pretty good at belly dancing this one won't be so bad, but if not it may be hard for you to pick it up.  When it comes to exercise videos I am seeing that I need to stick with more traditional types and forget the ""fun"" dancing ones.  I didn't do so well with the dancing with the stars ones either but thank the Lord they were from the library.  I am more of a Denise Austin and Tamilee Webb gal.  I think this will be my last feable attempt at the dancing videos.  If your local library has it I would say check it out first.  I think it is easier to stay neutral on reviews if you didn't actually purchase the item.  Nothing makes us more mad than to be disappointed in a purchase we have made which is why I choose to get most of my books, cd's, and dvd's at the library.  I have found some winners and some loosers.  This dvd isn't super bad nor is it super good.",1313020800,,1481,3.949324324324324
