7978622,1,B000083C5B,"This is a slow, insipid, all-but-plotless film. I suppose a man playing an irresistible woman was a bit of a kick in 1969, but not today, especially as it is obvious the star is not a real woman. Her singing is strictly low-grade Amanda Lear as well. There's no reveal at the end, not a wig pulled off or a reason why this ""enchantress"" destroys the men who fall in love with her the moment they see her. She repeatedly states, ""I'm a bad woman."" I agree, not to mention she's a bad woman in a bad movie. Not even good for a few chuckles.",1449100800,,538,4.133333333333334

7978625,5,B000083C5B,"A wonderful decadent and kitsch masterwork, Visconti and Fassbinder would have loved it !
The fact that a transexual plays the role of the women every man falls in love with enhances the strangeness of the movie.
Akihiro miwa sings many great songs in it.
This could only be made in Japan, remembered me of some novels of Tanizaki.",1367798400,,331,4.627118644067797
7978626,5,B000083C5B,"The idea seems to focus on love and the search for love.  The Black Rose Mansion seems to be the center of the story, as men come to debate and even fight over the meaning of love.  Can love ever be real?  Can you ever find love or is it, like the Black Rose that can never turn red, a myth?
Directed by Kinji Fukasaku, who directed Battle Royale and some of the Japanese sequences in Tora, Tora, Tora, this is a must for any Japanese movie library.  Akihiro Maruyama plays the main female character.  Akihiro's voice should be known to anime fans, as he was also Moro in Princess Mononoke and the Witch of the Waste in Howl's Moving Castle.
Many viewers may be confused by the use of a male to play a female character but I would suggest trying to see past that and just enjoy the story as presented.
Extras include a interview with Kinji Fukasaku and trailers.  Get it used or new.",1183852800,,883,4.25748502994012
7978627,4,B000083C5B,"Good not great, I'd give it 3 & 1/2 stars.  Black Rose Mansion is from highly prolific Japanese director, Kinji Fukasaku who directed 61 films.  One of his most famous films ""Battle Royale"" is a gruesome film, this is more of a 'tale' and while there are a few fights scenes I did not find it excessively violent or gruesome.  Both films star Akihiro Maruyama, in this film playing a bewitching impersonator/ singer.

Black Rose Mansion is a softly told story of family relationships, choices, romantic love and it's often tragic consequences.  I found this film fun to watch and had realistic and semi-enlightening exchanges between father and son.  As well as some insight into the tradition of ""Family"" in Japan.  The film is from 1968 and it feels dated and foreign (to this American viewer) but in a way I find enjoyable! (i.e. classic cars and stylish-classic Japanese furnishings, along with a slightly existential tone as is found in many films from late 60's/early 70's).  What I most enjoyed was the sequencing of the film and the subtle yet effective editing techniques.  I found this film fun, but the story is just slightly above average foreign films.  The story does not rely solely upon dialogue and subtitles highly readable/ visible.  Pairs well with popcorn or red wine.",1162080000,,1289,4.86697247706422
7978628,4,B000083C5B,"I have seen  this move when I was 13, the beautiness of starring MIWA didn't affect to me, sorry, she was so old to me at that time. Now ? ah, I don't  deny the beatuiness of her. The movie itself is not amazing level of art at that time, It was great years of Japanese movies.",1134518400,,277,3.8421052631578947
