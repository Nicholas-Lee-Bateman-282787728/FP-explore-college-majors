7469964,4,B016BVI5R6,Program has an interesting premise and a quirky set of characters. We'll see if the writers can sustain  the interest engendered by the series debut.,1454198400,,149,4.96
7469965,5,B016BVI5R6,"I really enjoyed this. The whole way through the 10 episode season I was under the impression this was a mini series with a 10 episode run. But the way it ends....there is more of this story to tell. (That's all I'm saying) It's clearly set up to be able to continue, and I hope NBC does. I will absolutely watch a second season of this.

I LOVE the full hour run time for a comedy. The extended time gives the writers room to make both a dramatic and funny show and develop both of those elements. I've read a lot of the magazine and newspaper reviews around the internet and the main complaint I find is the 1 hour run time. People seem to hate that for a comedy, but I really really enjoyed it.

I think it's acted well. I think it's written well. It's not drag out knee slapping comedy. It's just an overall humorous drama.

The first episode is all about the lead in to the apocalypse. A comet is going to destroy Earth in 34 days. (This is not a spoiler. The comet is literally the first thing you see on the screen, followed by a new anchor telling everyone it's all over, then they jump back 34 days to tell you how they got there. That's all in the first 20 seconds of episode 1)

The set up of the show explores the lives of and their actions over the 34 days prior to the world ending. Each episode gets a little closer to the impact of the comet.

This had the potential to be super boring, but it really kept me hooked. I really hope NBC does a second season of this.",1454025600,14,1480,4.107266435986159

7470012,4,B016BVI5R6,"Others have discussed the plot here so I won't go into that. I will just say this was such a different show that I stuck with it to the end. I think Rob Lowe's Father Jude character along with Sister Celine really made it for me though.
SPOILERS AHEAD so stop reading if you care about that-
I was very bummed at the end of episode 8 called ""Savior"" because my favorite character died. Now I see there's not going to be a second season and I'm even more disappointed because I had this epiphany where perhaps they could bring back the Father Jude character as an angel who, in a bit of cosmic humor, can only be seen by Sister Celine!
But I guess none of that's going to happen now so, oh well. Fun show. I liked it. Too bad it won't be back.
Please release it on bluray at least. I'll buy the whole season & producers can recoup some of their cash spent making it. Win-win.

7470015,3,B016BVI5R6,"The usual ""big meteor about to strike Earth"" trope gets a British airing in this well-acted and produced series produced by SkyTV and exported to America.  Unfortunately the writing is an uneasy mixture of disaster film and madcap adventure.  The most interesting thing (IMHO) is that the series strongly implies the existence of God or somebody very much like Him.  Certainly worth watching for fans of this sort of thing, would have gotten four stars except that the end leaves a bunch of loose ends that set up a second series, which apparently isn't going to happen. And for the following:

SPOILER ALERT:  The central story arc concerns the conflict between twin brothers, one good but ordinary, the other bad but extraordinary (both nicely played by Mathew Baynton).  Throughout the series we are led to believe the narrator is the good twin who is eventually saved.  Then, at the very end it turns out that it was really the bad twin who, improbably, showed up at the last second, knocked out the good twin, took his clothes and pretended to be him in order to get into the shelter.  The good twin is shown naked and injured crawling toward the closed shelter door.  Everybody likes a good twist ending that suddenly shows previous events in a new and unexpected way.  But this is arbitrary, distasteful and just unpleasant. .",1462060800,,1333,4.781659388646288

7470027,4,B016BVI5R6,"This was one quirky show!  We hung in with it, even as we sometimes exchanged glances of confusion, and I'm so glad we did, and am SO disappointed that it wasn't renewed.  I think the main quirkiness and confusion was that the topic - the impending end of the world - was sometimes treated with a rather dark or even silly humor, and other times with the exact profound depth of agony one would expect in that situation.  That juxtaposition - while confusing (what kind of show was it supposed to be?) - was sometimes clunky, but in the end (pun intended), gave the viewer a chance to breathe and keep her head above the dark waters of the actual storyline.  I was all on board with the actors and acting - excellent cast of new and familiar faces - and the writing was moving, funny, somber, and evocative.",1461715200,,807,4.395973154362416

7470029,5,B016BVI5R6,"WARNING - SPOILER ALERT

Really?  Not signing again for the second season?  I *loved* this show - it was so different (maybe too different?) and you know shows introduced in January never do as well as shows introduced in the Fall.  Here poor Jaime is, son of ""God"" and all, outside the bunker with evil twin inside... and now we'll never know?  Where is Bravo or FX when you need them to pick up a cool series that isn't appreciated on regular network TV?  Bring back Firefly!  Ok... slightly off topic there...  But really enjoyed this season - wish they would have had a slightly better ending not knowing whether or not they'd be renewed..  But still rather enjoyed it.",1461196800,2,673,4.541666666666667

What a great show.

Perhaps too many concurrent threads but they intertwine nicely by the end.

7470032,2,B016BVI5R6,"I really enjoyed Season 1 of this TV show.  It was quirky, unique, and a lot of fun.  Parts of it were over-the-top, but it was funny in its outlandishness.  I finished watching the 10th episode, and was amazed that every story arc ended in a cliff-hanger.  What was going to happen to the people inside the bunker, and more important how were the people outside the bunker going to survive?  Is Jamie the Son of God, or is he a prophet like Moses (well Jamie did part the Thames).

After the last episode I went to find out when Season 2 would start, and much to my disappointment I discovered that the show had had been CANCELED.  There would be no Season 2.  The cliff-hangers would never be resolved.  If I had known that, I never would have watched the first season.

So now I am left with all these unanswered questions.  Maybe SyFi will pick it up and produce a Season 2.",1460505600,,878,4.2926829268292686

7470034,3,B016BVI5R6,This was an interesting and quirky series to watch but that last episode was just plain off.  The first 9 episodes do a great job of building toward the conclusion... the final episode was a mix of irritating and stupid.,1459555200,2,220,4.5
7470035,1,B016BVI5R6,"The ending ruins it all.

Would've given five stars except for that, and that consumers are not warned seems a betrayal of a deeper sort.

Hey, all you folks posting here who seemed so happy about the series, how about at least a peep about the ending?

 The loose ends at the end are big, glaring, and there's a dozen of them.  Virtually every single character was left hanging at the end, and the series is NOT going to be finished.  Not just zero closure -- it's negative closure.  We should have been warned by ""the powers that be,"" but no, we're all played to be suckers in many a regard.  Not worth the time to try to actually complain -- and they KNOW THIS.  It's a theft of some degree -- if you ask me.  Even the ending was ruined in that about 20 minutes before the end, the viewer knows that there's not enough time left to service all the unanswered questions.  So, one watches with a growing disdain as the frustration mounts.  Screw that.  Don't do that to yourself if you're thinking of renting.

7470073,5,B016BVI5R6,"This was a Must See after I bumped into it on air. My cable vcr has limitations on what I can view when recording 2 other programs at the same time.
The casting is marvelous (although I only recognized Megan Mullaley and Rob Lowe) and has wonderful chemistry.  I am particularly fond of ensemble casts, and this program takes it to a higher level.  There are illustrations of every kind of diversity imaginable:  race, nationality, career/avocation, philosophy, goals, lifestyle, etc. Finding humor in peoples' actions ahead of an impending tragedy would have seemed impossible, but this program does it well. I found visual humor in a chaotic background - a man in the crowded street had both a sandwich board sign saying, ""The end is nigh,"" and a hand-held sign stating, ""I told you so.""  The absurdity of the events as they unfold also brings its own humor. But beware. You could get caught up in some of the ways it replicates real life - or your suspicions about certain current events - and lose the flow.
