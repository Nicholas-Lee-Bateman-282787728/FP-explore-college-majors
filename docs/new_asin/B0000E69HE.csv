8001911,5,B0000E69HE,The main features are good very campy examples of gays in cinema (using that word loosely)  BUT the shorts in the extra section are the real gem of this DVD.,1428883200,,157,4.233333333333333
8001912,3,B0000E69HE,"I bought this DVD for the second feature ""Sticks and Stones"". Both features are from the time period when the Supreme Court had just opened the door for pornography if it had socially redeeming and artistic merits. Sticks and Stones is an interesting time capsule of life on Fire Island in 1969.  The movie is poorly written, poorly directed, has lots of soft Gay porn, and is so bad that it is funny. All the cast of characters are present from 1969; a leather queen, a flamer, a hippie, a guru, quarreling lovers, a bull dyke and others make up the ensemble. A low budget film, a poor man's Boys In the Band, it is a great film to  have in a collection of period pieces to see how far we have come as a movement.  The Meat Rack is pure soft porno peddled as a art house film.  The extras on the film are historically interesting especially West Hollywood's First Gay Pride March/Parade in 1970. Favorite line from Sticks and Stones, ""I loved that dog.""",1332633600,,954,4.403409090909091
8001913,4,B0000E69HE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first feature on this dvd, The Meatrack.  It actually surpassed my expectations based on my previous Something Weird video experiences, with more depth to it than most of the stuff they release.  On the one hand, it's similar to the heterosexual ""nudie"" movies SW Video frequently releases in that there is frequent male nudity (mostly back side), but the film itself is far more interesting than SW Video fare such as Country Cuzzins or the Chesty Morgan films.  If anything, I would compare The Meatrack to Cher's early film, Chastity.  As in Chastity, The Meatrack's protagonist is haunted by early childhood experiences, experiences which cause him to sometimes make questionable decisions in his later life.

I have to say that I could only sit through about 25 minutes of Sticks and Stones.  While the actors were generally attractive and scantily clad, the dialog was incredibly boring.

The extras were generally not particularly interesting, either.  The first couple were sort of interesting from a historical perspective, but most of the extras are silly soft-core films with bad music and horseplay.  The final extra is an early soft-core video featuring legendary John Holmes; I finally understand why he became so famous (or is that infamous?).  The Meatrack, indeed.",1233705600,5,1306,5.1761904761904765

8001915,4,B0000E69HE,"A seamy side of the '60s, San Francisco style, as bisexual street hustler J.C. blithely sells himself to whomever comes along: a bored housewife cheating on her husband; a fat drag queen who wears a corset and sings; or the tricks in the balcony of a theater showing ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS (""I said ten bucks or I'll break your hand!"") Blaming everything on his whorish mom and sleazeball dad, he cruises the gay bathhouses in search of cheap sex without emotional attachment. But things change when he sees an old letch of a photographer trying to accost a gal posing in the nude. J.C. attacks the old coot, rescues Jean, and they immediately become lovers. They're also confronted by two transvestites wielding a knife and a movie camera, and are blackmailed into making an instant erotic film. Fed up, they decide to leave the city, so J.C. looks for work; meaning, he picks up a trick who wants to be abused.  But -- whoops! -- Jean comes home from the movies too soon, freaks at J.C. and his date, and is promptly hit by a car. Oh well. J.C. returns to the balcony of the Banner Theater where, to music from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, he is quickly surrounded by a bunch of sex crazed men.",1156464000,2,1198,4.470319634703197
8001916,5,B0000E69HE,Great Vintage 60's and 50's Stuff for gay people unfourtanely something weird movies are more focused on the woman I wish they would release classic vintage gay movies like this more often. I highly recoomend this dvd it has a lot of sorrow and emotional depth to it in a something weird way............,1149552000,9,303,4.735849056603773
8001917,5,B0000E69HE,"Don't let the campy description fool you. Both of these films are minor classics and major groundbreakers of gay cinema. Meatrack is a strange morality tale that features some excellent cinematography and Sticks and Stones is a fly-on-the-wall account of the dissolution a relationship against the backdrop of a party on Fire Island. Both were made in 1969, before The Boys in the Band and all of the other great Hollywood films came out. The shorts included are also a cool indication of the kind of things guys were watching in the dark of their own dens or at peep shows in the 1960s.",1071187200,20,587,4.653846153846154
