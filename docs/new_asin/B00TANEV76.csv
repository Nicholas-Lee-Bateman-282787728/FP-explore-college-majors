8701153,5,B00TANEV76,"The item description on Amazon for this product very well sums up the contents of this DVD. The beauty of this feature presentation is that it brings to light the efficacious intercession of St. Therese of Lisieux in this modern world and how she continues to influence people of all ages and of all walks of life, be they Protestant or Catholic, to follow her simple way of loving God in the small ordinary actions of everyday life and by living out one's vocation with joy and simplicity. This is the core of her spirituality which is contained in her great classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-a-Soul-The-Autobiography-of-St-Therese-of-Lisieux-Third-Edition/dp/0935216588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux, Third Edition</a>. The very candid interviews by people from around the world makes St Therese's message all the more relevant and attractive in a world desperately searching for meaning in life and a quest and thirst for God.

In addition to this, we get a very privileged first hand look at the Carmel of Lisieux, where St. Therese lived out her life as a religious, including a good look at her cell, infirmary where she passed away and the great Basilica that was built to honour her. We also see many relics associated with St. Therese, her writing desk, needles etc. everything associated with her living out her vocation of love.

This is an excellent documentary, quite different from other documentaries on the Saint and is a step up in further discovering and journeying along St. Therese's Little Way.

This presentation is 51 minutes long in English without subtitles. There are no special features on this DVD.",1429142400,10,1742,5.397058823529412
