8141455,5,B000HT3P4C,"Can you handle the dark?
Can you handle the despair?
If so, you will find this well-made movie--where no one, no one, no one wins--exceptional.
This Venezuelan film makes you feel the grimness of life--no, survival; no--the brief time before death--in the slums of Caracas. This is not about the poverty of possessions; it is about the poverty of souls.",1232841600,,353,4.9

8141457,4,B000HT3P4C,"A very good movie by director Gustavo Balza. Recommended for people that appreciates movies like Amores Perros or Solas. The film opens and ends with the sharp notes of a bandola, and in between we see the sad story of Aixa, a pregnant teenage girl that lives in the marginal areas of a South American city (Caracas in this case). Around Aixa, there is a family where men are absent and the main financial support comes from the work of her grand mother. A priest and a doctor deal with matters of live and death every day in this urban chaos. The film analyzes in a balanced way the moral dilemma of bringing babies into a world full of violence; a violence that never ends and consumes everything. The shocking end will make you think for a while.",1163808000,,749,4.434782608695652
