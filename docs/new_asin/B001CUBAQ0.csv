8289865,4,B001CUBAQ0,"""More Snack Food Tech"" provides viewers with an overview of how six popular snack foods are made, beginning with soda pop.

A Dr. Pepper bottling plant serves to illustrate the making of soda pop.  The drink was invented in 1884 by a Waco pharmacist.  (Coca-Cola was invented in 1886 in Atlanta, also by a pharmacist - it contained caffeine and a coca leaf extract.) Soda pop ingredients include flavoring, sweetener, coloring, and filtered/treated water.  The ingredients are first tested, then mixed.  Meanwhile, an inverted rinser cleans bottles.  Drink droplets then pass through a carbonated gas, before filling the bottles and being capped.

Soda pop was mixed at drug store fountains in the 1920s; the process included jerking the carbonated water lever back and forth as part of the mixing process - hence, the term ""soda jerk.""

Donut mixture is forced out by air pressure to form the proper shape.  Krispy Kreme has two mixing plants in the U.S.; the ingredients are then sent out to local KK shops.  Ingredients are tested before mixing.

Pork rinds are made of pigskin cut into 1"" squares that are cooked, cured, cooled, sorted optically (off-colors removed), fried, seasoned, and finally packaged.

Beef jerky is made from very lean beef that first goes through a slicer, then tumbled and marinated, smoked, inspected, and packaged.  Two-three pounds of beef are required to make one pound of jerky.

Ninety-eight percent of corn is for animal feed.  Popcorn goes back 20,000 years.  Popcorn is first weighed and tested (moisture content, popping size).  It then is stored until reaching optimum moisture levels, then cleaned, combined with flavor ingredients and oil, and packed.  Microwave popcorn is packed in special paper that allows steam to vent, while keeping the oil inside prior to popping.

""More Snack Food Tech"" then ends with the mixing and preparation of chewing gum.",1224892800,4,1895,5.11400651465798
