2063250,5,B00025LRSC,"Doo Wop Gold 51 was recorded in Pittsburgh in 2000. Wish I could have been there to see these performers singing old favorites in person, but this dvd bring them to you. My favorite is The Tokens singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"". Jerry Butler hosts the show. Other favorites you're sure to like include Bill Pinkney doing his rendition of ""White Christmas"", Shirley Reeves singing Carole King's ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"", and the comical ""Stranded in the Jungle"" by the Cadets. Oh, what pleasant memories!",1259798400,6,514,4.919540229885057

8022562,5,B00025LRSC,We have had the whole set of these dvds for a number of years.  Volume 1 is a favorite of my husband's and one day he took it out and it cracked while removing it from case.  He was so upset about it and went online and found it on your website.  He was so glad about that.  It was delivered shortly  thereafter.  I recommend it highly for people who love the 50's music.  Great music.,1356480000,,385,3.986842105263158
