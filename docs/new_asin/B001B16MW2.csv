8281231,5,B001B16MW2,"Found this DVD particularly useful in the final trimester of my pregnancy with my daughter. By about 24 weeks I was really finding it impossible to get a good nights sleep, mainly due to aching pains and tension in my lower back. This video has some great techniques for relieving those pains and I really noticed a difference after about 1 week of practicing these massages daily. My partner also picked up a few tips on how to help me relax and get a more comfortable sleep. Highly recommend this DVD for all the pregnant mums out there - and as we all know sleep is a bit of a luxury when baby comes so it's important to get as much of it now while you can!",1413590400,,660,4.2047244094488185
