2936514,5,B000VDDDZK,"Very happy with the purchase to get this great show on DVD - all of the regular season episodes plus the Jake and the Fatman episode where the characters were introduced for the series - I was a bit surprised and disappointed that would be included but not the TV movies preceding the start of the first season of the series, but I am going to assume (and hope) they will be released on their own DVD box set along with the other movies.

For those unfamiliar with the show, the show has a great cast including veteran Dick Van Dyke, Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio, Barry Van Dyke, and Charlie Schlatter.  It is based on the classic ""whodunit?"" formula with a fairly unique twist - the main investigators are doctors working in the hospital rather than just cops, lawyers, and PIs, although they are certainly in the mix, too.  It's a serious drama but also adds in a lot of comedy / humor as well.  The show is also fairly clean with no excessive innuendo or foul language, but parents should still use discretion given the seriousness of the storylines.  If you enjoy Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Perry Mason, and the like, you will probably enjoy this series as well.  Give it a try.

I hope the next seasons will be released soon.",1240272000,,1229,4.484304932735426
