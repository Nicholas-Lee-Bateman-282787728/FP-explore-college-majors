3820380,5,B001VB8U9K,"I had originally viewed this series when it was on A&E over 25 years ago!

John Romer is an excellent guide, as he takes you into the Cairo Museum to view the artifacts there. Food, utensils and tools that they used to garden and eat with.

This used to be available only on VHS tape. The cost was $250.00

I happened upon a copy at my local library and transferred it.

My VHS copy is quite worn as I have viewed these tapes many, many times.

I highly recommend this DVD. I like it so much that I'll probably buy it for myself!

3820383,5,B001VB8U9K,"Romer is, in my opinion, what most academics should be - always interesting - and it's apparent he loves his work!  He invites viewers, and readers of his books, to go along on the explorations.  So, I already enjoy the Ancient Lives series.  I'm grateful that the series are now at prices I can pay, and each time I look at a section, I learn or see something I didn't notice the first time through.  If you enjoy even just the visual aspects of a face on an ancient statue, or paintings on walls, or mind boggling buildings, I recommend Ancient Lives.",1453852800,,553,4.392156862745098

3820389,5,B001VB8U9K,"John Romer is perhaps one of the most intriguing and personally fascinating historians there is. He is unflinching when it came to describing the lifestyles of all peoples' rich and poor, in the ancient world. He is passionate conversations about the passions of ordinary people, and is special also because he points out even the smallest details to his audiences, for sometimes the tiniest clues open up worlds of discovery and insight often lost to the average tourist. In this special, he will take you to places that, for many reasons, are not available to the public, even distant back trails of the region surrounding ancient Thebes, to which he is deeply committed. This program makes you grateful of those who, although not pharaohs or priests, nevertheless cooked, wrote, shared, crafted, sung, carved, and painted the very words, images and statues we admire the world over. This program as a monument to those villagers for all civilizations of the ancient world in turn. Highly recommended, especially those who wish to look beyond the gold and the glamor and to the rich and poetical passions behind their work.",1421280000,2,1125,5.021390374331551

3820394,5,B001VB8U9K,"The opening screen warns you that as this material was filmed years ago, it did not match modern film standards and may be noticeable on DVD playback.  However having watched the first disc, I can't say I was that troubled.  Sure, in high definition I could probably make out some tiny figurines better.  But the narration is at least as important as the images.  This was totally fascinating stuff.  The price has come down and if you have an interest in ancient history (specifically Egypt) you'll very much enjoy it.",1398816000,,519,4.722222222222222

3820396,2,B001VB8U9K,"If you enjoy reading textbooks then you will love this video.  I purchased this to possibly show to my 6th graders as part of an Egyptian History Unit.  I just could not force this on them.  It would be way beyond the attention span available to them.  Frankly, it was beyond mine.  The droning of the narrator lulled me into a semi-catatonic state, and when it was done, I realized that while they may have filled it with great information, they presented it in a way that I was less likely to remember it.",1390435200,,507,4.351063829787234

Then they broke, I have looked for this series once a month for almost 25 years!  It is by far the best documentary on the subject on the Valley of the Kings.

3820399,5,B001VB8U9K,I have watched this so many times. I love it. John Romer is the best. His love and respect for the Egyptian people is so evident in this video series. It's really a love letter to this civilization from John Romer. All the things he knows and is willing to share. His energy and vitality shine through and knowledge as well. You just gotta watch it to know what I mean. Anything John Romer does is first rate.,1384992000,,409,4.256410256410256

3820402,5,B001VB8U9K,"Saw these four shows on PBS in the 1980s before a trip to Egypt and it was a great introduction.  John Romer is an Egyptologist and very entertaining.  There have been countless documentaries on Egypt offered by PBS and cable channels since but this holds up as unique.

With Egyptian politics at a boiling point, now might not be the time to go, but when things calm down, go visit.  After 40 years of traveling the world, it's still my favorite trip!",1376438400,,452,4.475609756097561

3820405,5,B001VB8U9K,"The tape I made of the series when broadcast was almost extinct. I had given up hope of ever finding the series on DVD. The quality was sublime; colour and sound quality was like being there. John Romer is an ace communicator and makes his explanations simple, fascinating,compelling and obviously from the heart. The series, dealing with the lives of the men who made the wonderful tombs and the history of their village, is spell binding. Anyone interested in Ancient Egypt, be they enthusiastic amateurs, novices or more thoroughly versed in the subject should own this set.
It arrived quickly, well packaged for safety and is an absolute joy. Thanks to all concerned.",1350345600,,671,4.946902654867257
3820406,5,B001VB8U9K,"ANCIENT LIVES is a DVD set that is not only educational, but it makes learning about the artists of Ancient Egyptian kings fun and inviting. By the time archaeologist John Romer completes his filming and explanations of the Egyptian artists and their life-style, you want to grab a pick and shovel and hop on the next plane to Thebes and the Nile River.

This 4 episode DVD set (205 minutes plus more on Bonus) is not about the Kings and their lives; but rather, this detailed documentary is about the people who lived generations, lifetimes, in the Workers' Village. These were the scribes, the artists, the carvers, and the craftsmen and their families that decorated the royal tombs and created the antiquities that get all the attention in other Egyptian stories. These were the laborers, the common folk, like you and me.

They not only left written documentation about the rulers, the these scribes also carefully carved their own stories and way of life into the rock walls and pieces of stone around Deir el Medina, the tomb-makers' village. They left their own mark and story among the hills around the valley of the kings, and the scribe's family history is as interesting, or in some ways with more relatedness, than that of Pharaohs, Queens, and their gold plated mummies.

Several royal tomb scribes, beginning with Ramose (1275 to 1241 BCE)provide enough data to follow them through their lives and discover how they lived, how they felt, what they admired, what they dreamed and who they loved. They left behind personal family correspondence, with historic footnotes. It's a textbook via DVD on the ANCIENT LIVES of these common workers, but extraordinary artists.

The ""people of the village"" faced hardship, hard work, and little reward except the pride of their work. Eventually things like famine, grave plundering, and changes in the pharaohs wishes, brought about major changes in the village, even it's eventual doom.

You'll get some looks inside magnificent tombs; see valuable aesthetic pieces, and hillside scratches; visit museum housed artifacts; and all along this trip, get thoroughly enlightened as to what you are experiencing from John Romer, a famous archaeologist that looks and acts the part of one of the commoner people of the village.

You'll see a small bit of King Tut and Queen Nefertiti, but you'll enjoy more the story of scribe Harshire (and others), and actually are shown a location Romer thinks will be the next great golden Egyptian dig archaeological windfall.",1328832000,2,2511,5.024038461538462
3820407,5,B001VB8U9K,"I saw this documentary years ago on PBS and had one episode on my vcr and lost the others. I like other people have yearned for this to be released and it finally is. John Romer is a very excellent author and truly exciting person to listen to. He brings this series alive the whole way through. He goes into the everyday lives and people of the village. Everthing from fights to drunken villagers out of control. He takes you on the everyday path the tomb builders went to work as well as explaining their lives and families. He wrote the book Ancient Lives which is also an excellent companion to this series. I never saw a documentary as great as this one on Ancient Egypt. If you think Zahi Hawass is good,this guy is even better. He takes you through the 4 part series from the great period of Ramesses II through the slow decline of the Egyptian Empire. It is a show I shall never forget. I own several of his books and I highly recommend them along with this DVD series. I only hope they put out the other Dvd series he did on Egypt. 10 *******************************************",1300492800,9,1087,4.44

If I had had this level of material available at the time, I may have become an archaeologist.  John Romer again proves that his documentaries set the standard in the area.  Any possibility of Romer's Egypt becoming available?  I have bought everything else he has made.",1290816000,3,375,4.796875
3820409,5,B001VB8U9K,"Just a great little series about the villagers of Deir-el-Medina.  I first saw it years ago on PBS and found Romer engaging, interesting and knowlegeable.

3820410,5,B001VB8U9K,This is one of John Romers 1st films and its about his love of Ancient Egypt. Using the unusual idea of following the ancient writings of a group of ancient Egyptians. Mr. Romer explains the various aspects of those long ago lives and brings them back to life with his usual vim and vigour. I just can not express my admiration properly for his work and only hope that his film Testament comes out soon in DVD. Well done Sir!,1268611200,3,425,4.325
3820411,5,B001VB8U9K,"The Athena Co. has produced a great conversion of ""Ancient Lives"" onto DVD.  The image quality is quite good and, while there is some small hiss in the audio, the narration and music sound good.  I have owned the old VHS tapes of the show (bought from a library when it folded) and I have seen the exorbitantly expensive DVDs of the show sold by Films for the Humanities.  This latter DVD effort wasn't very good as it looks like they simply converted their VHS copies over to DVD.  By contrast, the Athena edition sold here appears to have gone back to more original source material; the resulting DVD is significantly better.  Thank you Athena Co.!

Given the quality of this edition, I hope that the Athena Co. gets around to doing some of Romer's other 1980's era documentaries: Romer's Egypt (3 episodes) and Testament (7 episodes).",1265500800,5,837,4.659863945578231
3820412,5,B001VB8U9K,"If you are going to own just one documentary on Ancient Egypt, this is it. John Romer brings the emotions and passions of these ancient people to life.
I have enjoyed this series all these years, since it first aired on PBS. Now having these DVDs is just great.
If you've ever had any interest in the great civilization of Egypt, get this series before it disappears. Thank you John Romer.",1264550400,4,389,4.492957746478873
3820413,5,B001VB8U9K,"Ancient Lives is a documentary unlike any other I've watched. Viewing this passionately presented 200 plus minute voyage through the lives of a village of Egyptian tomb-makers living in the small village of Deir al Medina from approximately 1275 - 1080 B.C. is comparable to indulging in a vibrantly written biography as opposed to a committee-compiled, dry textbook.

John Romer is the driving force behind the series, his desire to conserve the great archeological sites in the Valley of the Kings leading him to present these Egyptians as people with rich thriving lives. Their love lives, family dramas, occupations, and so much more are explored with Romer as an expert guide. Watching Ancient Lives is like having a legitimate Egyptologist guiding you through museum exhibits, on-site hieroglyphics and tomb art, ruins, tombs, and so much more.

Part of the great charm of the series is seeing a man deeply immersed in his element and sharing his deep love for the subject matter with us as he moves through on-site explorations. We get to see Romer crawling up toppled statuary and searching through the Valley of the Kings for burial chambers that have yet to be discovered for example. Where else can you watch an Egyptologist finding himself stuck in possible tomb openings? (There are some occasional mild epithets in the series.)

Ancient Lives is generally acceptable viewing for all ages. Our children have watched the series with us and our oldest (six) finds it quite fascinating. It was much to our surprise when a scene entitled ""Erotic Papyrus"" in the scene index came on-screen. The graphic nature of what amounts to Egyptian pornography in the second episode is definitely outside the limits of general family viewing. Parents and educators, consider yourself forewarned -have your remote handy to skip this brief scene.

Perhaps as fascinating as the documentary itself is the success the series enjoyed. It both drew attention to the Valley of the Kings and Deir al Medina, spurring an upswelling of further scholarly research, but the inclusion of film snippets from an Egyptian film in episode four represent perhaps the earliest use of reenactments in documentaries - a highly effective technique that modern documentary viewers now take for granted.

Originally filmed for British television in the `80s, the series has been resurrected on DVD under the Athena Learning division of Acorn Media. I'm incredibly thankful. The need for entry-level documentaries is well filled with introductions to the pyramids, to mummies, and so on - but Romer's vision of the everyday life of the Egyptian tomb builders is incredibly valuable for those seeking to go deeper in their understanding of the history of this mysterious country.

As a result of age, there are some minor flaws in the film's appearance that couldn't be repaired in its translation to DVD (a disclaimer is included). The color and film quality is also par for the course for the early `80s. Volume 1 includes the first two episodes and includes on-screen text descriptions of major Egyptian deities, biographical sketches of notable archeologists of ancient Egypt, and show host John Romer as additional special features. Volume 2 includes episodes three and four along with a bonus 23-minute documentary that chronicles a quest to recreate Egyptian beer from archeological findings.

Navigation through the two-disc set is easy and efficient - viewers can select which of the two episodes they'd like to view on the disc, or use standard scene selection menus. Subtitles are also included. A 16-page viewer's guide includes a map of the region, summaries of the episode, questions for further reflection, additional insights on life as a scribe and Egyptian hieroglyphics, and entries from John Romer on his recommended resources for further learning and how the series was made.

Romer is always completely at ease, warm, and enthusiastic as he moves through the Egyptian landscape. Older students ready for a deeper exploration of Egyptian life, filled with rich detail will gobble up the wealth of knowledge that's found in Ancient Lives. The opportunity to sit at the feet of a renowned Egyptologist as he shares his knowledge on film is simply too good to pass up.",1263513600,6,4257,5.132756132756133
3820414,5,B001VB8U9K,"Although I've loved John Romer's work in books and teledocs since I first saw ""Romer's Egypt"" sometime in the 'eighties, I don't intend to review ""Ancient Lives"" here, except to say that Mr. Romer is a brilliant and openhearted presenter of material that he obviously loves and understands well. What I do intend to say now is that Alexis Logan at Acorn has told me that they intend to release Romer's ""Testament"" to DVD in May 2010 -- if God wills (a little allusion for those of you already familiar with ""Ancient Lives"", which is who this message is for).",1262908800,2,558,4.59

Having been to Egypt and seen all the places he shows, even the village, It's great to see them again. I feel I know the people he talks about.",1260403200,,471,4.130434782608695
3820417,5,B001VB8U9K,"Apart from it often being poorly presented, what makes the study of history frustrating is that it's either military history of a series of extremely old copies of People magazine: obsessed with celebrities and rich people. We study history to learn about ourselves. I do not know your lineage but I doubt any of us are related to Herod the Great or an Egyptian pharaoh. This is what makes Romer so remarkable - he cares about people and he does not view time in linear fashion. We may like to slap the word, Ancient, in front of groups of people who lived many years ago, but they are present to him. The artifacts, wall paintings, letters they exchanged deliver them right in front of us now.

His love of civilizations is not imbued with tedious class bias when it's not relevant. His own speech is testimony to that. Most Brits with his background carefully scrub their accents and stiffen their mannerisms when they achieve high academic standing. Not so, John Romer. All he cares about is conveying to his viewers and readers just how fascinating the distant past is. And how distant is it, really? In terms of the history of this world these people lived only moments ago and human beings have changed little or not at all during that time.

Most of his body of video work is not available. Those of us clever enough to make VCR recordings of Testament or Romer's Egypt when they were broadcast dare not post them online. Copyright issues. How anyone can claim defense of a copyright for material they do not offer for sale is beyond me, but I do not mean this to be a rant. Just grab this - quick - before it vanishes yet again.",1259971200,3,1636,4.505050505050505

No one can make the past come alive the way that John Romer is able to. He makes you feel as though you're being transported back in time ... walking among the ancients ... and it's pure magic. I watched the original series in the early 80s, owned it on VHS ... watching it over and over again until the tape would no longer play, and have been hoping that it would come out some day on DVD. I'm thrilled that my wait is finally over. Purchasing this is an early Christmas gift to myself and suggest you do the same. You won't regret it.",1257120000,31,647,4.102362204724409
3820419,5,B001VB8U9K,"I first saw this series on PBS many years ago, and recorded it in Beta format.  Before I got rid of my Beta player, I copied it to VHS.  You can imagine the low quality of the resulting VHS tape!  But I still found it to be irrestible to watch again and again.

When we think of Ancient Egypt, what comes to mind for most of us is the massive monuments, stautes, temples, tombs, and the rest of ""official"" Egypt.  The humanity of the ancient Egyptians is not seen in these creations.  What Romer does is use the writings (found on vast numbers of stone chips) and history of the tomb craftsmen to describe their life over a 500 year period when they were working in the Valley of the Kings. The result is, IMHO, by far the best video presentation on ancient Egypt ever produced. The story of the village of the craftsmen illuminates and brings to life these ancient Egyptians.

Romer has also done a marvelous series, available on DVD, on Byzantium.  If you have seen it, you know how skilled he is at presenting historical subjects.  ""Ancient Lives"" is even better than his ""Byzantium"", so don't miss it.",1256947200,4,1105,4.45771144278607

8345897,5,B001VB8U9K,"I came upon this 1984 British series by accident, and am delighted with it. It is low-tech, but makes up for that by having almost every minute filmed on-site.

On-site equals the fully excavated 3,000 b.c.e. village of Deir el-Medina and the tombs and hills around it. As John Romer, the presenter, explains, through a unique set of circumstances, we probably know more about this desert site than any other ancient village and its inhabitants.

One of those circumstances is that Deir el-Medina was the home of the skilled craftsmen who decorated the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. This meant that, unusually, most of the villagers were able to read and write. They left an amazing trove of writing and carvings, documenting personal as well as village stories.

Romer does a great job of giving us a sample of these stories. Such as Ramosa, celebrating becoming a Royal Scribe without the benefit of a familial leg-up, a self-made man. And Paneb, a foreman of great skill but violent temper. And even a labor strike: ""Month after month, as the men worked in this tomb, they saw their standards of living going down. The supplies were late in coming. Nobody seemed to care.... Then one day, as they came in in the morning, their indignation just boiled over and they walked right off the job.""

Romer likes these people, he loves ancient Egypt, and his stories are filled with humor and great information. In addition to the personal stories, he explains the ancient Egyptian's culture and commerce, and the people's relationship to their gods.

The four episodes of ""Ancient Lives"" total 200 minutes viewing time. It is presented in 4:3 aspect ratio and Dolby Digital. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and the video Bonus Feature D.

Bonus Features:
....A... ""Who's Who Among Egyptian Deities"" Written pages to read on the screen, describing the story and attributes of 1 ancient Egyptian gods.
....B... ""Real Life Indiana Joneses: Archeologists of Ancient Egypt"" Written pages to read on the screen, biographies of 6 archeologists who specialize(d) in Egypt.
....C... ""John Romer Biography"" Romer is an author and also has more TV series.
....D... ""Pharaoh's Liquid Gold"" (1994, 22 minutes) The story of how scientists and brewers collaborated to create a beer based on an ancient Egyptian recipe. Its story continues on Bonus E.
....E... ""Tutankamen Egyptian Ale"" Written pages to read on the screen. In 1996, after having to grow ancient wheat and create the correct strain of yeast, the Scottish & Newcastle Brewery produced a limited edition of 1,000 bottles of ale.

Finally, in a favorite sequence, Romer climbs down a skinny cleft in the hillside, to enter an ancient tomb robbed along ago. As he struggles to get down into the narrow space, he tells us, ""I once got stuck in a tomb like this. Blooming hours, I was, getting out. Somebody had to come and lift me out in the end.""

8345898,5,B001VB8U9K,"This program is much better than just walking through the monuments. We get to see how ordinary Egyptians lived at the time of the pharaohs. At times, it can even get down to being a sort of soap Opera.

How could we get to such details and know so much about individuals? Well John Romer (one of my favorite authors), actually reads the details and lets us see for ourselves how it is done.

Although focusing on the ancient lives and how people lived, we do get a generous overview of Egypt through looking at tombs and items that were tombs.

There is a disclaimer at the front of the film letting you know that the program was transferred from earlier recordings without any cleanup or enhancements. Original date is 1984.

I found that this presentation has a fairly good subtitle display with black around the white letters so the mostly white scenes in the background do not washout the actual words in the subtitle. The subtitle is great for when you want to look up subjects by names that are almost impossible to spell.",1498089600,,1029,4.545945945945946
8345899,3,B001VB8U9K,"I saw this on TV when the series first came out.  I adored it.  But watching it now on DVD, it seems very slow paced and doesn't hold my attention as well.",1494979200,,155,3.8125

8345901,5,B001VB8U9K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD I have had the book for a long time but never seen the series.
It is an old series and that sometimes is a bit obvious  when viewing, but they do actually
mention that fact. To be honest that didn't bother me at all I was glad to be able to purchase
it, but it may bother other people. I was delighted with it. and it arrived soon and was well
packed and of course I am a fan of John Romer anyway.",1487980800,,427,3.852272727272727
8345902,4,B001VB8U9K,"This series merits another 5-star rating for all the reasons given by other reviewers. When I was teaching 30+ years ago I found much of Ancient Lives, used judiciously, of great value for our middle school Egyptian world history unit.  Nevertheless, for  all my enjoyment and appreciation of this excellent documentary series--and it is one of my favorites--I am giving it a 4 (there being  no 4.5 rating) for the insufficient warning of graphic sexual content in Episodes 2 and 3. Episode 2 at least gives a heads-up with its chapter title of ""Erotic Papyrus"" for its brief exposure of graphic art. However, Episode 3's  chapter 4  titled  ""Intimate Possessions"" gives little warning of its extended coverage of sexually oriented material. As I said in my title, an excellent series but parents and teachers beware.",1476144000,,817,5.014814814814815
8345903,5,B001VB8U9K,If you do not know John and his many documentary's you need to jump on the band wagon. Clear concise witty informative and best of all a great story teller. If anything about Egypt interest you this is a friend for life,1468800000,,219,4.238095238095238
8345904,5,B001VB8U9K,"This series takes you into the ordinary lives of extraordinary craftsmen during the pinnacle of ancient Egypt's imperial power, thousands of years ago. While we consider this part of history to be remote and primitive compared to our modern world, they were actually a very complex and sophisticated society that documented every aspect of life to astonishing detail. This series is yet another masterpiece of archaeological storytelling by John Romer, and I can find any faults to it, it's that it leaves you wanting so much more.",1465516800,,531,5.114942528735632
