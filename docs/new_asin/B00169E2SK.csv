Most exercise trainers just don't care to cater to the plus size crowd, even people like Jillian Michaels who was on biggest loser, just does videos that are way too hard for me at a little under 300 lbs. Debra and her team are very normal looking and plus size. Her story is encouraging for me because I can relate being close to 300 lbs. The movements are doable and the choreography is basic so most will not get lost doing the workout. It has some side squats but she doesn't go that low and no weight, so there is less of a possibility to get injured. The workout goes a heck of a lot faster than the Leslie Sansone dvds and is more enjoyable. ( I find Leslie Sansone dvds to be pretty boring. She needs to use more steps!) It is for truly obese women though because near 200 lbs I used this workout and it was too easy. Right now it gets me right at or around my target heart rate of 130. It isn't a perfect workout. Her cuing could use some work and form pointers, but I like it for what it is.",1510704000,,1095,4.074074074074074

8261788,3,B00169E2SK,"It is great that Debra Mazda has created a series of dvds to get large size people moving their bodies. I just wish she would not make any deal out of the fact that she went from size 26 to a 12. Weight loss should not be a goal. If we move to lose weight, most of us will not keep it up if we don't lose weight. Fitness and health  can happen regardless of our size or weight. Bodies love to move and it makes them feel great and increases health. Is that not reason enough to do it?

As someone who is recovering from body hatred, I would love to see the weight loss emphasis taken out completely.

Also, learning how to eat intuitively and learning  stop counting calories and controlling food is one way, and I think the best way to get off the diet/binge cycle, once and for all. To learn how to do this please read ""I'ts Not About Food"" by Laurelee Roark and Carol Emery Normandi. Another excellent book is called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Health-at-Every-Size-The-Surprising-Truth-about-Your-Weight/dp/1933771585/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth about Your Weight</a>""Health at Every Size"" by Linda Bacon PhD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Not-about-Food-End-Your-Obsession-with-Food-and-Weight/dp/B002PJ4G40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Not about Food: End Your Obsession with Food and Weight</a>Also, see the film, America The Beautiful by Darryl Roberts.

8261789,2,B00169E2SK,"I was not impressed with this workout video at all. First the fact that it's WAY over priced for a video that has the  quality of a dollar store DVD. Second, the  workout is hard to follow, and way too L O N G! There's nothing different from this than any other hard-to-follow, cheap exercise dvd except a few mildly overweight people are doing it. I expected a lot better from my fellow fat chicks.",1247097600,2,399,4.306666666666667
8261790,3,B00169E2SK,This Deb Mazda dvd is more for a person just starting out with exercise.  I've been exercising for years and found it a little slow.  Was hoping for something a little more different.,1242604800,,183,4.515151515151516
8261791,5,B00169E2SK,"I weighed 250 pounds on 9/15/2008.  I began writing down everything that I ate and staying under 1200 calories a day.  I hit a plateau at 238 on 10/8/08.
I thought if I could excercise it might help me lose weight faster.  So I went online and found Debra Mazda's video.  I love it because I can do it at home and as of today, 11/13/08 I am at 230 lbs.  20 lbs lost and only 80 to go, ha ha.  I truly believe with watching calories and working out 3-5 times per week will get me there.  I already feel much better.",1226534400,4,514,3.9320388349514563
