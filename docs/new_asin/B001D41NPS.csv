8291605,2,B001D41NPS,"I owned both his Beginning and Advanced DVDs.  While Kevin might be a very strong player in Singles, he was nonetheless not very good in demonstrating techniques.  E.g. in the ""Jump Smash"" video, he didn't really decompose the details.  If people could learn well just by watching, there won't be a need for this DVD.  One can probably learn more watching some of the Youtube videos nowadays.",1486857600,,392,4.8059701492537314
8291606,4,B001D41NPS,"I like the slow motion clips and the section on doubles court movement--really helpful!  Good video for drills ideas, too.  I also like how it's all divided into chapters, so you can easily jump to a section you want to watch.  Worth watching!",1454457600,,243,4.604651162790698
8291607,3,B001D41NPS,"Kevin Han's Advanced Badminton DVD covers all the drills necessary to improve one's game. I suspect that most of the really good players I meet have practiced most if not all the drills. This DVD is a great help for any player who has mastered the basic shots but needs information about how to improve them. One might encounter difficulty if control and placement of the shuttle is not good. Some of the drills require the ability to place the shuttle consistantly at a specific location on the court and continue the rally with your partner.

The negative side is that the camera angles do not clearly show the detailed movement of Han's racquet. That requires trial and error on the part of the student to learn the precise motion. I play with many Mandarin speaking players but I had to replay several parts of the DVD to understand what Han is saying.",1229212800,2,856,4.594771241830065
