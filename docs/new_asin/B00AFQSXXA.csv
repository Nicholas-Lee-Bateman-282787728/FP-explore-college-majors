8551118,3,B00AFQSXXA,"This video is VERY smartly packaged. It makes one think it came out of a think-tank where a team of professional musicians combined to set a buyer on a lifelong course to blues mastery. Well, not quite. This takes you what resembles a musician's storefront where he's sitting on a stool, playing a simple walkdown over and over while finishing up with riffs implying what you DON'T know. And therein lies the bait and switch. There's no finger patterns, no slow-mo's of how he makes those runs. All you get is how to walkdown...again and again and again.

Granted, you can play this over and over and over, slow it down and painstakingly figure out what he's doing at the end of the walkdown. Only at some point you're going to figure out that this is what you paid for and didn't quite get. Plus there's a lot of theory he tries to pass off as jargon that is going to fly directly over a newbie's head. Which is what I suspect will happen to some of these CD's in the hands of totally discouraged buyers tossing them at the trashcan.

All in all, you can probably do just as well watching some old BB King videos. They'd be just as instructive and far more entertaining.",1523923200,,1171,4.416666666666667
8551119,5,B00AFQSXXA,"This Guitar World DVD was just what I needed. I'm new to guitar but this DVD (which also includes a PDF of sheet music and TAB of all pieces on the DVD) taught me the rudiments of 12-bar blues rhythm shuffle (Jimmy Reed style), Walking Bass, Complete 12-bar with fills, Turnaround Variation, Jimmy Rogers-style Chords, Elmore James-style and Johnny Winters-style licks, Muddy Waters-style 12-bar, Eight-bar progression and fills, and more.

Andy Aledort, editor of Guitar World, takes you through each 12-bar progression, four bars at a time--first at a normal pace, then played slowly, then broken down into individual notes, chords, and progressions, and then back to normal pace. Of course, his Gibson Les Paul makes each piece sound fabulous, but Aledort is also a superb musician.

This method of breaking things down was a real help for someone like me who lives in a rural area and is going to be largely self taught; I don't have easy access to formal guitar instruction.

Great for a novice. I love and use it all the time.",1359504000,7,1032,4.8522727272727275
