2700639,5,B000L99JDO,"""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" is a classic from my childhood and I was glad to find the 2nd Season for a reasonable price.  The item was delivered right on time and the seller has proven to be reliable.  I recommend!",1225670400,,216,4.119047619047619
2700640,5,B000L99JDO,"This is definately a good thing to buy if you want to continue collecting the series! Thankfully because you don't have to follow a story from season to season, you can actually buy this season first and youll see whats going on. They love telling scary stories around a campfire! That is the basis of the show, besides being fun!",1213142400,3,330,4.516666666666667
2700641,4,B000L99JDO,"Despite this package being totally devoid of extras, the quality of the shows themeselves and the fact that this is the only non-bootleg collection of this show currently availabe, this is definitely a sufficient enough holdover until Nickelodeon gets their act together. Sadly, those jerks probably never will.",1170720000,4,311,5.5
2700642,5,B000L99JDO,"The second season of the hit series Are you Afraid of the Dark got even better with scarier tales. The series centers around a group of friends that tell spooky tales around a campfire. This show was the leader of the Nick at Night fans. It resembles Eerie Indiana to a degree but is way spookier. This season we hear tales of a locker that is haunter by a hippie, kids getting tested by aliens, a boarding school with an evil plot, a boy following his bicycle to the grave and a boy that will do anything to gain affection by a snob, even if it means turning into a monster in the process. This will forever be my favorite tv show from when I was a kid. These season sets are only released in Canada so be sure to grab them while you still can. I can see the price increasing after they stop manufacturing them- which will happen. The episode list is below. My favorite episodes are 4,6,7,10,11 and 12. Enjoy!

1. The Final Wish

2. The Midnight Madness

3. The Locker 22

4. The Thirteenth Floor

5. The Dream Machine

6. The Dark Dragon

7. The Frozen Ghost

8. The Whispering Walls

9. The Full Moon

10. The Shiny Red Bicycle

11. The Magician's Assistant

12. The Hatching

13. The Old Man Corcoran",1167004800,23,1204,4.274336283185841

2700783,1,B000L99JDO,"I know a lot of you are excited to see this on DVD and giving it 5 stars for the show. I would too. Except I'm rating the release format, not the show, which is why I'm giving it 1 star.

It is disappointing that this isn't a complete season and instead just a volume or collection of episodes. Its even more disappointing that this release is a burnt DVD-R and not a factory pressed disc.

The good news is there is an official season 1 - 7 factory pressed collection that was released in Canada. Unfortunately the original run is out of print and the prices can be ridicules.

However, they have re-released seasons 1 & 2 this year (2013) at an affordable price. Perhaps if sales are good enough they'll continue to re-release the rest of the official factory pressed season collections.

So why not pick up the complete seasons 1 & 2 from the Canadian Amazon.ca while you still can? Canada & the US are both DVD Region 1 so you won't have any issues with video playback.",1382054400,3,973,4.359116022099448

2700785,5,B000L99JDO,"I just happened to come upon this series as I was passing through what's available on Amazon Instant Prime. Once I saw this, I knew I had to go and watch. There's definitely a sense of nostalgia for me when watching these. This, along with the other shows they aired during SNICK, were staples of my childhood.

Sure, the stories aren't as scary as they seemed back then, but they're still some good stuff. The look and feel of the show is definitely dated, but that can easily be ignored. The one real problem that I have, the same as the other volumes, is that this is just a volume collection, not an actual season. It was a little off-putting to be told that a couple storytellers moved, and then the next episode in the volume has them back. Not a huge pain, but just a little annoyance. I'd much rather these be in seasons, and in the right order.",1381536000,,853,4.33125

It is still a great show the only reason I removed a star is because over time the special effects have been a bit degraded to the tech revolution we have had since then but I still suggest people watch it.

2700829,3,B000L99JDO,"Amazon did a good job at putting some episodes of this series together, but it wasn't what I expected. It claims to be season 2 of AYAOTD, yet there are only 8 episodes here and the second season had 13. The episodes in this ""season"" are just random episodes from seasons 1-6 with a total of 8 altogether. No major complaints because I love AYAOTD, and this was a nice blast from the past, I was just thinking it was the full season.",1346112000,9,433,4.228915662650603
2700830,4,B000L99JDO,This show is about two kids that live in an apartment building and experience odd stuff on the 13th floor.  It reminded me a little of the old star treks. As always the ending is unexpected.,1341532800,,190,4.277777777777778
2700831,5,B000L99JDO,"This show from the AFRAID series is much like a mystery as it reveals an unexpected ending, at least it was for us.  It shares the way kids make friends and how kids respond to new situations. I watched this show with my grandaughter and she watches it over and over, even plays it outside. The end surprised even me.",1341532800,,317,4.283333333333333
2700832,5,B000L99JDO,My grandaughter and I have watched this over and over.  It is not too scary but thought provoking.  I love all the AFRAID shows and remember them when I used to watch them with my daughter when she was young.  I love the 90's!!,1341360000,,227,4.113636363636363

Overall, an enjoyable experience. I've been watching them with the little girl I babysit and she loves them.",1336867200,,275,4.3076923076923075

2700836,5,B000L99JDO,"I shopped around for season 2 for a while.  There was no way I was going to pay close to $200 for one season of a show.  So, when I saw season 2 for sale on here for $45, you can imagine my surprise.  Being the skeptic I am, I emailed the seller and verified that this was a region 1 dvd.  He responded that it indeed was.

I emailed the seller a second time and inquired as to why they would sell one copy for $200 and one copy for $45, as they were both listed as new region 1 copies of season 2 of Are You Afraid of the Dark.  I got an answer that simply said that they are $200 because they are out of print and hard to find.  That did not answer my question.

So, it was with great hesitation that I purchased the $45 copy.  Well, I got it in the mail today.  It was exactly as described.  It was in its original packaging and in perfect condition.  It plays in my dvd player without any problems at all.

I'm thrilled to have gotten this product for such a low price, considering all other copies of this are going for 4x as much.  So, I chalk it up to good timing and possibly a listing error on behalf of the seller.  Either way, the transaction was smooth, delivery prompt, and the product was exactly as described.",1328659200,,1224,4.0
2700837,3,B000L99JDO,"If you're, or were, a fan of this show, this was a lot of fun to watch again. Being older, though, it has lost a lot of what made it special because it's a little out-dated. Highly recommend for children who have never seen before.",1302480000,,231,4.155555555555556

I CAN'T WAIT to have kids and have them watch some of my favorites cartoons arn't what thy use to be. Its ran down garbage where kids are to believe stupid is a good thing. All in all this was all star status of the 90s,1294099200,,301,3.71875

2700840,5,B000L99JDO,"For all you mid to late 20 year olds...remember Snick..our evening version of Nickelodeon? Well if you do, then you remember sitting in front the the tv, for that new weekly episode of ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" My good friend and myself wanted to go back in time and remember what it felt like again to be easily entertained. Some now would say, the show is korny and not worth the time. However, I can safely say that even though some of the acting is a little lame, they are still great stories, that for the early to mid 90's were well written and original. You have to put yourself back into that frame of mind, and if you do, you will appreciate the episodes just as much as you did when you were 10 years old. I went for Season 2, I had seemed to remember more of the episodes from 2 instead of Season 1. And no worries, you may hear that this was a show filmed in Canada that Nickelodeon picked up..which is true, but any rumors about the intro being different is NOT true. It's still the same great music, montage of creepy scene's(boat in the water,swingset,trap door to attic with clown doll) and a match which ignites only to blow out and create a mist of smoke across the words...Are You Afraid of the Dark? If you are a fan of the oldies you grew up with, make your purchase and add to your dvd collection. You are not crazy for wanting to watch the videos you remember as a child. There's a kid inside all of us.",1252454400,,1430,4.203636363636364
