8097204,5,B000CCCNDI,"A previous reviewer didn't like this DVD, and typed out some excerpts from it to show how ""unfunny"" it was.  I was laughing just reading the exchanges, and they're so much funnier to watch!  Really, the mannequins are so creepy and stupid that they add to the enjoyment.  Personally, I don't need the mannequins to be moving for them to be funny, and my family loves the Fuccons as much as I do.

If you're silly and like stupid jokes poking fun at American sitcoms, then this is for you!",1322870400,,488,4.388888888888889
8097205,4,B000CCCNDI,"In a very surprising move by ADV Films, the popular OH! Mikey shown on the Tokyo TV's Vermillion Pleasure Night (known for the surreal works by Ishibashi Yoshimasa) will be coming out in the US as THE FUCCONS on December 20th with an introduction DVD and on February 22nd as a first full release (52 minutes).

  It all about a mannequin family that moves from the U.S. to Japan.  The series is absolutely crazy, it's fun!

  The series has generated a fan following in Japan, a fan blog and even OH! Mikey merchandise.).

  The episodes are about 2-3 minutes long but it's quite surreal to see a show like this.  Wow!  Try it!  It's unbelievably funny!",1220400000,,653,4.525862068965517
8097206,4,B000CCCNDI,"I picked this up for like $5 somewhere, maybe less. There are a number of very short episodes that I find very funny. It's ridiculous and definately not funny to the average American. But the surreality and the simplicity of the humor is great and fresh. Recommended if you find Aqua Teens or anything like that funny",1169942400,,317,4.578947368421052
8097207,1,B000CCCNDI,"Ha Ha! I met the Fockers.  Now I have met the Fuccons!  Fuccon hilarious!  Not really.  And their name happens to be the funniest thing about this series.

This is done with mannequins.  Mannequins that don't move whatsoever.  If you thought South Park and He-Man were the bottom of animation techniques, you haven't seen this Fuccon series.  It is a bunch of changing angles of overly happy mannequins with voiceovers.  The lips don't move.  Nothing moves.

I thought good animated Japanese satire of American culture would be interesting.  Nothing is funny here.  Not really much satire either.

I could only sit through 2 episodes and various fast forwards of other ones.

Here's some examples of the content.  (not exact quotes)

Mikey:  What should I do today?
Father:  You should go to school.  It very important
Mother:  School is very important.  You need to get ready.  Ha. Ha. Ha
Mikey: But it's Sunday.  I don't think it's open today.
Father:  But its very important so you should go anyway.
Mikey: Yes daddy.  School is very important

later that day.

Father: What did you learn at school today, Mikey?
Mikey: Nothing, they weren't open today.  No one else was there.
Father: That's because it's Sunday.
Father, Mother, Mikey: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Later in the same episode.  Mannequins are standing in yard.  Mother is holding a hose which is spraying near Mikey as they talk.

Mother: How are you enjoying your Sunday?
Mikey:  It's fine but I am getting wet.
Mother: That's because you are standing where I am watering the lawn.
Mikey: Is that what Sunday is for doing?  Is Sunday the day meant for you to spray me with water?
Mother: No Mikey, there is no direct connection with today being Sunday and me spraying you with water.  It's just a coincidence that today is Sunday and that you happen to be standing where I am watering.
Everybody: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

If this was funny to you, get this Fuccon dvd.  If not, just avoid this Fuccon family.

I did watch some previews of later episodes and they will actually have the mannequins be pushed over or drop other items.

I just don't see how other people enjoy the above type dialogue done with shots of totally stationary mannequins.",1143072000,10,2197,4.678947368421053
8097208,1,B000CCCNDI,"Okay, I've seen a few episodes, and...

Well, I can't say anything good about this whatsoever. I know other DVDs mention that the Japanese is actually good, but I didn't see it and it might be a good idea if they mentioned if the subtitles were more accurate...or funny.

Anyway, the dub does not do good whatsoever. Quite simply, the jokes are not funny. It's not even jokes, exactly. It's just still mannequins saying crazy stuff. The only line I can actually remember is the Mother standing there, waterring the garden, while the kid was hit with the water hose. Then she said that she lied about him going to school in the previous skit.

The kid says that he wished his mom wouldn't water him, and his mom asks him to not stand where she's watering. It is not delivered well, it is not funny.",1142812800,2,797,4.445205479452055
8097209,4,B000CCCNDI,"I need to start this by saying I love the Fuccons, I watched the Japanese series before ADV licensed it here. It was called Oh, Mikey! If you like the more ridiculous or bizzare stuff on Adult Swim like 12 oz mouse, tom goes to the mayor, etc, and you like some of the stranger anime, you may very well like this. If you don't like the idea of space ghost-type dry delivery by mannequins that don't (or barely) even move, don't bother. But this $4 intro disk is awesome, has 8 episodes, and if anything you can pass it around to annoy your coworkers and friends. Someone you know is gonna love it.

This show follows an american family living in Japan, trying to fit in, and failing miserably. Just buy this, for crying out loud, and make sure you watch the episode where Mikey has to go to the store for his mom. Amazing.

My only complaint (but it warrants an entire star being knocked off) is the HORRIBLE DUB JOB BY ADV. PLEASE, ADV! Find some NEW VOICE ACTORS! The dad is horrible and I suspect without looking it up he's the same dude that (horribly) dubbed Ilpallazzo in Excel Saga. The guy sounds like a 3rd-rate actor playing comedy, and Mikey's dad (and Ilpalazzo) were played deadpan. Why this guy can't figure that crap out is WAY beyond me. The director of the american dub needs to get his crap together, or find a new job.

After the rant, I still love it. Watch it, buy it, but mail ADV and send that guy packing.",1141948800,3,1429,4.304832713754647
8097210,1,B000CCCNDI,"this is the biggest waste of 1.60 ever. it won't even make a good coaster because plastic isn't absorbant. it should be a law that if there is the possibility that if the content of a dvd or cd sucks this bad it should at least have an absorbant top layer. I knew going in that it was a jab at americans, i read the cover, but come on this is so infantile and unfunny i'm embarassed for the japanese and anyone who thinks it's funny. i thought it would have good 3d animation but it's not animation, it's just mannequins posed (is that to say that americans are stiff...hmmm that's funny).

buy this only if you need something to throw at the creators of this garbage.",1138060800,5,668,4.25984251968504
8097211,1,B000CCCNDI,"The lamest humor I have seen this side of Tom Goes To Mayor. Not even worth $3. Was this really funny to anyone?

Seriously, you'd have to have a double digit IQ to sit through this.",1137110400,,182,4.055555555555555
8097212,5,B000CCCNDI,"This review is for the Japanese DVD, and not this American release.

The Fuccon Family, otherwise known as ""Oh Mikey!"" is a show about an American family living in Japan. In no way do they seem interested in Japanese culture, and all of Mikey's friends are European (or that bizarre clock/robot boy.)

The show is incredibly fast paced, and is very silly, even subtitled the jokes work. ""Soi yu ko to!"" At the end of every short episode Mikey and his family learn a lesson. They all state what they've learned and have a good hearty laugh-80's cartoon style.

Oh, and it's all acted out by mannequins with voice overs. There is nothing better than watching mannequins swing on swings, and ride down slides. Other than those rare sequences, action is usually implied and when they talk their faces are frozen in those over the top looks of joy.

There are a variety of characters and a storyline that really builds on previous episodes. Tracy, his sexy tutor, Bob the teacher and Bob-Mama, Laura his self-centered hipster cousin, and of course his love interest Emily.

I'd recommend this to anyone with a quirky sense of humour who doesn't get creeped out by mannequins.",1135382400,14,1170,4.74384236453202
