I was hoping for a few more pictures of the train enroute and cities, the Hudson River, etc. that the train passed along the way.
But I am glad I purchased this DVD.",1490832000,,251,4.478260869565218
8415183,2,1627003746,"I ordered and payed list price for this DVD.  I am hoping to send it back for a refund,  I would have been dissapointed had it of been a freebie and I am not really sure what if anything this video brings to the history of the 20th century limited.  You just keep getting drilled throughout the video that its a high end train and the interviews do little of nothing to bring any new insight or info to the history of the 20th century.  I am still in amazement that Trains name is on this video it is certainly not of their quality.",1473465600,2,532,4.086538461538462
8415184,2,1627003746,"Would have expected better from Trains magazine.  Sound quality is poor and it's difficult to understand many of the interviews.  No subtitles or help for the hearing impaired (it's needed with the poor audio quality).  There isn't much insight, it features a truly mediocre script and there's entirely too much reliance on unimpressive interviews that, taken together, doesn't result in much of a story.  I've come to associate Trains magazine with quality results and this is clearly a disappointment.  Given the subject matter, this could have been a wonderful presentation and a must have for any railroad enthusiast.  Surely, some will want to have this presentation because the subject is irresistible and that's understandable, but don't waste your money on it now; won't be long before this DVD will be on the $1.99 pile.  Instead consider one of the many great books on the 20th Century Limited.  Bad on Trains magazine.",1472688000,5,929,5.105960264900662
