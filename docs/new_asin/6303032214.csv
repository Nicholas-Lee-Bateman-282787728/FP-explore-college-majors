7834553,5,6303032214,"A good thriller. This is an Australian film and in PAL format. I didn't have much hope of it playing on my DVD player. I did some research and it turns out that virtually all DVD players in the U.S. made after about 2003, have chips that play both the NTSC format (U.S.), as well as the more global PAL format. Sure enough, an old player made by Coby didn't work but my later model Insignia, did. One other break is that the disc is ""All Regions"", which is essentially region zero. It played fine.",1467244800,2,497,4.242105263157895

7834555,4,6303032214,"This movie is about a good cop forced to undergo severe hardship in order to do what he knows is right. The dialogue is very natural and excellently performed. The plot is intriguing all the way through. LaPaglia, Weaving, Otto, and the other actors were fantastic. As a die-hard LaPaglia fan, I couldn't be more pleased!

If you're looking for a solid cop story with a touch of heart (but nothing soppy), I highly recommend this film.

The only downside to this movie is it occasionally has slightly cheesy music and a few other hints that it was produced on the cheap. Still, if this is the kind of gem that can come out of inexpensive production, what excuse is left for big studios to turn out so much crap? This movie shows that good writing and acting are the most important parts of any film. See it!",1097366400,5,807,4.445945945945946
