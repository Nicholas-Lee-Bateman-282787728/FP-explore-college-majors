3915549,5,B002E58FSS,Incredible DVD; awesome music and easy to follow moves.  Great workout that I would recommend to everyone who enjoys aerobics.,1258761600,12,126,5.3
3915550,4,B002E58FSS,"Boogie Down the Pounds is my third Richard Simmons' dvd but ultimately, my favorite so far.  Every routine was fun and at times, I forgot how much my arms were burning! It was very nice seeing some of the old crew and being surprised at how much weight they have lost.  It was very motivating.  I love the song selections and of course, the dancing.

I'm just getting back in the game and every day is a struggle.  Richard Simmons' is helping me to become active again and I love it.  It feels weird saying this but I look forward to working out every morning.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It really helps to work out seeing people who look like me and also where I would like to be one day.  Thanks.",1255478400,109,718,4.2592592592592595
3915551,5,B002E58FSS,I really loved this DVD! It was fun to do and the music will take you back to a time when fun was fun. And I loved the people in the DVD too. And this one guy in there called Wendel will make you smile and keep you motivated since he makes it look so fun! And Carla with her dancing skills will be something for the guys to watch! And the clothes was right on too. I think this DVD is a good investment and will bring you to your goal. C. Ayala,1255219200,52,444,3.734042553191489
3915552,4,B002E58FSS,"I enjoyed this DVD as I do all of Richard's workouts.  It was fun to see some people from former Videos working out with him.

3915564,5,B002E58FSS,I did Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies years ago and did very well with them . It is now 30 years later and I am doing them again to try to get healthy . A good intensity for a 62 year old. I still rememGober the steps. I do not feel overwhelmed or defeated and I smile a lot.,1454544000,,282,3.716666666666667

3915569,5,B002E58FSS,"I just tried this for the first time tonight, and I loved it!  It reminds me of the aerobics classes I went to in the 80s, where you followed the instructor without necessarily knowing where he or she was going next.  There's not a lot of direction, but so what?  The moves aren't that hard; I'm sure I'll have them down after doing this a few times.  It's a great workout, and the time went by in a flash.

This is not a workout for beginners.  You'll need some cardio fitness first in order to keep up.  There's also a lot of arm movement, so if you're not used to that, you'll need to work up to it.  If you are a beginner and still want to do this workout, just start out doing 20 minutes or so and work up from there.  It's so much fun, you'll have a blast!

This is a wonderful, fun workout, and I can't wait to do it again tomorrow!",1445817600,,839,4.0

3915574,5,B002E58FSS,"I love this workout! It's so much fun, and Richard is so motivating, what he says really keeps you going when you get tired. I used to workout to his videos as a teen, so when I finally made the decision to lose the weight, I knew who to turn to. Thank goodness for Richard!",1438732800,2,274,4.0
3915575,1,B002E58FSS,"This was such a disappointment. The music is not good, and the steps are hard to follow as Richard seems to do one move to the left and to the right and then moves on to a different move, left and right, and then another... I was accustomed to his original Sweatin' to the Oldies, which establishes each move a few times before moving on. I also felt like there was no time to catch your breath anywhere in this, and no built in heart rate checks either. Not for anyone just starting out, or anyone who requires more energetic music, because this fell very flat. Buy the original Sweatin' video - it's fun and funny and corny and inspirational all at the same time!",1438214400,2,665,4.328

3915595,2,B002E58FSS,"You definitely can work up a sweat but there is absolutely no instruction as to the actual steps.  You are expected to already know.  I am no dancer and struggle with not ""getting it"" but I just keep moving and keep trying.  My attitude is that it will come eventually and that at least if I keep moving I'll keep sweating.  Just disappointed that it wasn't as fun as I expected.",1405036800,,379,4.295774647887324

3915599,4,B002E58FSS,"I love Richard and his DVD exercise series, I have many of them. However, my favorite is Sweatin' #4.  It is lively and fun with the in-person band, music selections, and vigorous workout.  I like the fact that I really do work up a sweat and feel I have really worked out all major areas of the body. It took me a while to get all the steps down, but it really is not about being perfectjust keep moving and do your best! I don't need a hard wood floor, and can even do everything just fine in stocking feet on the carpet. I wish I had one more of Richard's tapes that had this same level of intensity and fun. Most of them are very good, and I use them, but this is the best one, in my opinion, for the workout that makes sweatin' fun and really does the job! I find songs and routines on different tapes and switch between during the same workout if I feel like going longer.",1398729600,6,878,4.069364161849711
3915600,5,B002E58FSS,"Great workout, which really dosn`t feel like a workout, but more like a dance-party. I just love doing it. And if you love to dance, you will love it too.",1397260800,2,154,4.166666666666667
3915601,5,B002E58FSS,Richard Simmons is very encouraging throughout video. fun music and great exercise! nice to see others who are overweight (not just me!) doing exercises too.,1394755200,2,157,5.32
3915602,3,B002E58FSS,Lots of steps and inadequate instruction.  It is obvious that the people working out on the tape have been at it a long time.  Not for a beginner.,1394668800,,146,4.178571428571429

3915604,5,B002E58FSS,Richard makes exercise fun and entertaining at the same time.  I love the music and the moves are pretty easy to catch on to.,1394150400,2,125,4.208333333333333
3915605,5,B002E58FSS,"This is about my tenth Richard Simmons exercise video.  Yes, he is over the top but his enthusiasm is contagious and the music gets me up and moving.  Isn't that the whole purpose??  This video is one big dance session.  There are not a lot of cues as to what move comes next but it doesn't matter as long as you are moving.  The songs are great for dancing, and when I am dancing I don't think I am exercising.  Before I realize it, an hour has passed, and I have been moving and having fun doing it.  Yes, I recommend this tape.",1391990400,2,530,4.087378640776699

I have a history of seizures & I couldn't look at the screen because I didn't want to take a chance of having 1.  Still, the music was lively, & Richard always makes exercising with him fun!  I used to exercise with him when I was a kid & I didn't even have a weight problem til my last year of high school.  I just had fun exercising with him!",1390521600,,490,3.9489795918367347
3915607,3,B002E58FSS,I thought the exercise program was too fast right from the beginning.  Not much of a warm-up.  I think exercise programs that are fast-paced should not go into the fast aerobics immediately.,1390521600,,190,4.90625
3915608,5,B002E58FSS,love it & I love Richard Simmons he always have his full size men/women in his exercise DVD's love him.,1388534400,,103,4.2
3915609,3,B002E58FSS,The trouble with Richard Simmons workouts is the transition between moves is not smooth and one must do them several times before you know what comes next.  This jerky transition can cause injuries as you try to catch up.,1387584000,,221,4.666666666666667

I wish there were many more - that is how much fun you will have! However, it is fast paced and I found it a tad confusing but after a couple of times I was fine.

I use Richard's videos and alternate with my treadmill. 40+ pounds gone so far!  This is a fast paced video. Take your time and rewind while learning the routines.  Adapt them for your level and ability. For instance, because of my knees, I don't do fast turns. Instead, I just go side to side. I like that Richard uses real people with real bodies - not size 2 models. It's a fun workout and if you stick to it, you'll see results!",1374278400,2,568,4.201834862385321

While Richard Simmons is the lead, he has his ""friends"" with him. They are a trip and vary wildly in looks, weight and attitude. Honestly, you'll start watching and get doing it and within ten minutes you'll be worn out.  You get ready to sit and then you see the three hundred pounder and their still working. Talk about motivation! The end shows each and how much weight they lost which is motivational, too. Great for all ages, sexes, weights and level of fitness.",1346025600,,611,4.407079646017699

3915635,3,B002E58FSS,"I love Richard Simmons exercise videos and own probably 10 of them.  I was excited about this one as it is reasonably difficult, but i just can't hear the music as it is much less loud than Richard's talking.  As a result, I have a hard time ""losing"" myself in the songs.  This certainly isn't the most difficult of his videos but tough enough to give you a good workout.",1332892800,,371,4.271428571428571

3915637,2,B002E58FSS,"Withing the first minute, I quit doing this video. It is too difficult to learn the moves. He switches to one move to the next too quickly. Someone as big as me cannot keep up the pace of this video and you need a lot of room. I don't have that.

Got my hopes up too much that I could finally find a video that I can do. Was very disappointed.",1318636800,,343,3.8309859154929575

3915640,4,B002E58FSS,"I'm 68 and thought Richard Simmons would be a good inspiration to get back in shape.  He's funny and entertaining.  This dvd, while a good, rather not-too-strenuous workout, is a little hard to follow.  He changes movements quicker than I can figure out what he's doing.  It will take a much repetition, before I can follow along exactly.  In the meantime, I keep up as best I can and just keep moving when I get lost.  Good music.",1308873600,3,431,4.461538461538462
3915641,4,B002E58FSS,"This video is great if you are looking to work out with a low impact aerobic routine. As always, Richard Simmons is loud, motivating, and cheesy. An example of this is the beginning where everyone (including Richard) acts like they were ""invited"" to the disco by an unknown person and seemed shocked when the spotlights come on, but just start the routine. That gets old to watch EVERYTIME. The workout is great, but long. I tried the 60's blast off for a 30 minute workout with Simmons, but that video was awful. He can be hard to follow at times, but the moves aren't so difficult that you won't get it the second time. Just walk and move your arms. My hips hurt after doing this one from all the sideways kicking, but hurt in a good way. It's good if you have a lot to lose, like I do, but maybe if you are advanced you will find it too easy.",1308787200,,845,4.222222222222222
3915642,1,B002E58FSS,"This DVD's sound system is horrible, compared to the original (or earlier) Sweatin' To The Oldies Workouts by Richard Simmons.  I can barely hear the music, plus it is not really ""boogie"" choreography.  The quality of the DVD is questionable... it froze up on me and then often gave me a message (skipping over the damaged areas).  Maybe it is because it is a ""Time Life"" DVD.  It say's on the back.... ""New, pumped up versions of the '70s hits"".... But, IMO, it is a watered down and muffled version!  Or maybe the quality of the DVD (damaged) causes the poor sound system.  Don't waste your money like I did.  I'd give it a NO Star rating but the system won't let me!  Stick with the original Richard Simmons Sweatin' To The Oldies!",1303948800,4,734,4.466165413533835

Richard doesn't explain to much and goes from one thing to the other quickly but once you do it... you got it.. and you know what is coming next.,1297900800,2,298,3.6984126984126986
3915647,5,B002E58FSS,He's trite. He's silly. He's goofy. AND he makes exercise lighter in spirit as he helps the exerciser to be lighter in body (especially when one can't get to the gym or track).,1296777600,4,176,4.363636363636363

8366837,3,B002E58FSS,"I love Richard's videos and think they're a fun way to keep me interested in exercising. Something about this video I didn't like-- it sounds like it needs to be remastered or something because you can hardly hear the music. This is a 'supersweatin' workout which means the songs are cranked up to club-speed, but they're so faint that all you hear is Richard's directions, and you're not moving along to a recognizable tune. If you're looking to boogie down some pounds, I would recommend Disco Sweat instead.",1523836800,,510,4.806818181818182

It's just as fun now as when it first came out.  I like it better than his first few videos because the music is better, and it has a dance floor atmosphere.  The music is Best of my Love, Lady Marmalade, Hooked on a Feeling, That's the way ( I like it), Love Machine, I'm Your Boogie Man, Mandy, Listen to the Music, Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?, Close to You.",1517616000,,526,4.019230769230769
