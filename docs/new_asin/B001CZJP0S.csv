I kind of wanted them in cases with the DVD covers of those sold in singles (as those look awesome), but this is was really nice, too.

I have gotten sucked in to Naruto this past year. I've also seen episodes here and there of the anime shown on Cartoon Network as well. I've been looking for something more so when Amazon suggested this I gave it a try.

It started off slow. It wasn't bad just slow. I almost didn't continue, but by the time I got to the last disk I was right back on Amazon looking for the next box set which doesn't appear to be available yet unfortunately. Will definitely order the next set.",1229040000,,650,4.327868852459017
3520811,5,B001CZJP0S,"This show is a must see not just for anime fans but for anyone who enjoys well written and well thought out drama. The story follows the young and brilliant Light who happens upon a notebook with the power to kill people. With the best of intentions at heart he sets out to use this new power to create a better, safer world. Unfortunately for him not everyone agrees with his methods and Light soon finds himself under investigation lead by the world's premier super detective know only as ""L"".
The intellectual struggle between Light and L is nothing less than riveting. I was stuck helplessly watching episode after episode because I couldn't wait to see what these two boys were going to come up with next. I also found that Light's decent from good natured student to sociopathic mass murder was really well done and an interesting look at how power corrupts.
I'm always reading these reviews to see what people think before I buy stuff but this is the first time I've ever bothered writing one myself. I was just that impressed with this one. Warning though, it is pretty dark and somewhat depressing so if you're looking for happy,happy,feelgood this is probably not your cup of tea. But, if you're looking for a great original storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish then I highly recommend you give this one a try. It's one of the best shows I've seen.",1227484800,15,1396,4.565737051792829
3520812,5,B001CZJP0S,"I first caught ""DEATH NOTE"" on television.  I've heard so many impressive things in regards to the storyline and also saw the series featured on NPR.  To get the critical acclaim that it has worldwide, this series must be special.

And special is what ""DEATH NOTE"" truly is.  From beginning to end, this series has just grabbed my attention because of its well-written cat vs. mouse storyline.

""DEATH NOTE"" is a 37-episode TV series that was created by Studio Madhouse and featured on Japanese television in 2006-2007 and featured in the US in 2007-2008.  The series has spawned a popular manga series, a novel, three live action films and has captured the attention of anime and non-anime fans worldwide.

The series focuses on the character of a very smart high school student named Light Yagami.  Bored with his life, he comes across the ""Death Note"" that has special instructions that if one was to write their names on the Death Note, the person would die.  They would die of a heart attack if there were no instructions on how the person is to die.  Or die the way the person possesing the Death Note wrote down.

The Death Note is from a Shinigami (death god) named Ryuk who seems to be bored in his own world and thus starts to enjoy how a person like Light starts to use the Death Note.

For Light (who goes by the name Kira), starts out using the Death Note by writing the names of criminals.  He starts to win supporters due to his ideology of creating a new world without these criminals.  But with so many deaths occuring, the police and the International community begin to fear this serial killer.  And along the way, Light is suspected by the police as a person of interest (a person who could be ""Kira"") and then Light starts to use his Death Note on those who are onto him.

Thus a mysterious detective named L is assigned to the case and the series becomes a compelling storyline of will L find a way to catch Light Yagami or will Light Yagami kill L first?  Two geniuses trying to outwit the other in a thrilling storyline that is so unique, I'm confident in saying that it's one of the most original anime to come out in the last decade.

The volume 1 box set features on the first half of the series (twenty episodes, five DVDs, four episodes per disc) as Light Yagami (Kira) moves forward to create his new world, while L and the Kira Task Force try to stop him.  Also, that there may be another person in the world who may possess a second Death Note as well.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

""Death Note"" was a TV series and I found the animation to be quite cool as it showcased a dark, stylish feel to it.  Featuring a good dose of J-rock and style to it's overall presentation, Studio Madhouse did a wonderful job in this series and bringing out the illustrations of Takeshi Obata and the storyline of Tsugumi Ohba to television.  The dark atmosphere really is well displayed in this anime series.

But the most appealing part of this series is the awesome voice acting.  Being the Japanese language purist that I am, I watched the series with Japanese voice acting and it was done very well.  But I have to admit that I was really impressed by the English dub voice acting.

Brad Swaile as Light Yagami, Battlestar Galactica actor (Felix Gaeta) Alesandro Juliani, Brian Drummond as Ryuk and Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa did a tremendous job.  As did the other English voice actors.  A job well done!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Personally, I wasn't sure what kind of ""special features"" would be included on the DVD box set but you do get a really awesome behind-the-scenes interview with the English voice dub talent.  Here are the special features featured on the Volume 1 Box Set:

  * Disc 1 - Behind the Scenes with Brad Swaile ""Light"", Clean Opening and Ending
  * Disc 2 - Behind the Scenes with Alessandro Juliani ""L"", Japanese Director and Character Designer Interviewer
  * Disc 3 - Behind the Scenes with Brian Drummond ""Ryuk""
  * Disc 4 - Behind the Scenes with Shannon Chan-Kent ""Misa""
  * Disc 5 - Behind the Scenes with Chris Britton, Vincent Tong and Trevor Devall ""The Kira Task Force""

And on each disc, production art and trailers are featured on each disc.  What I enjoyed about the behind-the-scenes footage is that they were lengthy and not super short.  You really get a good insight on the actor's take (from the beginning of the series) of their character, the challenges they faced in doing the vocal work and much more.  So, it was very cool to have these extras included on each disc.

I can't tell you how awesome this TV series is.  ""Death Note"" is truly special as it really show how power can corrupt but taking that cat versus mouse type of storyline of two geniuses trying to outwit each other.

There are literally so many twists and turns in this anime series that it really captures your attention and has you on the edge of your seat.

As for the DVD box set, I think it's just great that Viz Media chose to feature 20 episodes of the series and sell the box set for a great price!  I definitely like Viz Media/Shonen Jump Home Video really doing anime fans a great service by following a US TV Season Box Set style of pricing instead of selling the episodes as separate volumes.  You're definitely getting your bang for the buck.

Overall, a well-acted anime series (on both the Japanese and English side of things), cool characters, well-written episodes, stylish animation and a unique, compelling anime series that I highly recommend!  A+",1227052800,76,5482,4.544433094994893
3520813,5,B001CZJP0S,"The hugely popular anime from Japan comes to the U.S. in this season 1 set. I started watching this show when it replaced Bleach in the Saturday night line-up last year and I was really surprised. I can confidently say that this show has the best story of any anime I have ever seen (and will be within the top few of any anime-fan's list). When buying seasons of shows I'm kind of cheap so I try to go by the rule of (at most) $1 per episode. Animes are a little more expensive so I go by $2 per episode. Amazon has lowered their price to allow for it to fall into my range so I was quick to pre-order it; that's just how good it is. The whole series is pretty short, probably 3 or 4 seasons but it definitely ranks within my top three animes (and I'm not a huge fan of anime so even people who aren't will enjoy this series; an awesome story about doing the right thing and stretching its limits to the point that it becomes a threat to the world).",1225756800,19,950,4.058510638297872

3520829,5,B001CZJP0S,Deathnote was a series that I had only gotten to see the first season of when it first came out and washed I could have seen more of. I have to say I was not dispointed with it. Although I was surprised that for once I was disappointed when then antagonist died I was really routing for him. LOL.,1432684800,,296,4.033898305084746
3520830,3,B001CZJP0S,"First, the good:

If you don't already know, the plot and characters of Death Note are mind-blowingly original, clever, and entertaining. The story is a suspenseful battle between a person who has taken it upon himself to rid the world of evil with a powerful murder weapon called a death note, and a mastermind investigator who is both ingenious and incredibly odd. Their verbal sparring is really entertaining and sometimes comical. However, Death Note was first a manga and so all credit for the story and characters must go to the original authors.

That being said, this anime adaptation is really high quality in a lot of ways. I like how it follows the manga fairly well but still has its own angles and shots. It usually doesn't come across as stiff or awkward as far as that goes; they have found the happy medium of good, inventive animation that still captures the essence of the original manga art style.

The voice acting is really great, both in the Japanese version and the English. It's really rare for the English dub of an anime to live up to the Japanese version, but this one is among the few. There's virtually no difference in the viewing experience from one language to the other; both versions are superb.

Now, the bad:

I am afraid this anime is too melodramatic. Some things that were either treated in a rather comical way or in a quick, indifferent manner in the manga were so drawn out and weighed down by a soberness in this adaptation that it became overkill. How can you be impressed with the seriousness of an event or conversation in the story if EVERY event and conversation has its humorous, calm, or indifferent elements removed to make way for music so epic it would be more suited to something like The Lord of the Rings? (I mean, chanting choirs? During every other scene in a show about a supernatural serial killer? Seriously?) The moments that were the most sobering in the manga become same old, same old in the anime.

Next, Light Yagami has virtually no expression a majority of the time. He's like a puppet who walks around impassively giving monologues that are generally the same as the ones in the manga, just without any kind of punch because of their lifeless delivery and the overkill problem I already went into. I mean, sure he's ruthless, but he's not a robot. It's not as though he can't be startled by anything. I don't like Light Yagami at all, either out of fascination or sympathy or amusement. But he is a person and the anime's portrayal is mostly empty. That's the irony of it: Light Yagami is more animated in the manga than in the anime. Go figure.

All in all, if someone wanted to check into Death Note but didn't want to read the manga, I'd probably sooner recommend the live-action adaptations than this anime. Sure, the live-action versions take more liberties, but they convey the ideas of the books really well and are actually really good movies in their own right. Whereas this, for all its shininess and fancy music, is nothing more than a soulless parroting of the manga and so is both boring and displeasing at the same time.",1431820800,,3104,4.6225045372050815

3520848,5,B001CZJP0S,"Light Yagumi is a straight A student with a normal life, which he soon becomes bored of. He finds a black book titled Death Note. The instructions to the book explains that if a person's name is written in the book, then they will die in a specific amount of time. Curious and also in serious doubt; Light gives the book a test run on a criminal and realizes it's far from a hoax. He then decides to rid the world of all criminals with intentions on making the world a better place with him as the God. The government soon becomes involved, and they enlist the services of a detective named ""L"" to stop him. This begins a battle of wits between Light and L, where the loser's life is at stake.-summary

Based on the manga written by Tsugumi Ohba, Death Note is the story about a young man who believes he can change the world. This soon begins a duel of wits between two geniuses, which gives birth to the most memorable cat and mouse game I can remember. Director Tetsuro Araki did an excellent job following the manga for quite some time, but I will not judge the series based upon how accurately it followed the original source material. Instead, only on its merit, and how good or great I think the series is.

I have seen several anime which has grabbed my attention and held it for some time. However, there hasn't been many as gripping as Death Note. The interactions during the battle of wits between Light and L may be the best I have ever seen. The cat and mouse game between them is incredibly well written. The two utilize very intelligent and precise guesswork to out think the other. This results in a plot that never, ever, becomes boring due to its constant suspense, and numerous plot twist which are delivered to further enhance the story.

Death Note is mainly a character driven anime. Therefore, character development is delivered in bundles, and the personalities of Light and L are clearly what carries the show. Despite being overshadowed by both Light and L, the side characters are still well used and are developed as the show progresses. No one is really left out or reduced to a mere plot device during this first chapter of the series.

One of the series strong points has to be the possibility of the viewer being stuck on choosing a side. Even though Light may appear to be a misguided person with a twisted sense of justice, it's hard to argue against his point. While on the other hand, L believes no one should take the law into their own hands, because the law is still the law whether it's perfect or not. Both of these characters are very likable because they're drenched in charisma. I definitely had conflicting loyalties when it came down to cheering for one or the other. The characters of Light and L are that good.

Death Note is an anime that does play on one's emotions, and at times can also question one's humanity. The series expolits several themes; such as the corruption when given great power, faith in a higher power, silent feelings of man and ambition. The series accurately examines these themes through the characters actions, as well as the publics way of thinking. The writing is just incredible, and I often thought what my actions could be if I ever came into contact with such power.

The voice acting for both languages surpasses the narrative because I believe it to be flawless. The voice acting brings out the absolute best in the characters by capturing all possible emotions. For both languages, I will say this is the most well rounded cast I can remember where the chemistry can be felt with such intensity. The voice actors clearly feel their roles with the best performances by Mamoru Miyano(Japanese) and Brad Swaile(English), who both play Light Yagumi, as well as Kappei Yamaguchi(Japanese) and Alessandro Juliani(English) as L. I don't believe this is an exaggeration, but I haven't been this impressed with such incredible voice acting since Visions of Escaflowne and His and Her Circumstances.

Studio Madhouse delivers in the visuals department with vivid animation that also adds to the series greatness. I never thought watching someone write in a notebook or eat potato chips could look so cool. The animation is blended with 2D and CG, which results in some stylish scenes, plus the camera work also brings out the best, with well timed zoom in close ups, that ranges from lip movements to the writing with a pen. The animation is simply a joy to watch.

The character designs are given the same treatment and the characters are given a mature look, but I feel Misa Amane's gothic lolicon appearance hurts the show at times. The artwork consists of some incredible backgrounds, and it shows its range numerous times by dabbling between the dark and light moments. There is rarely a bad moment concerning the visuals. However, later in the series, there are some noticeable and inconsistent spots in the artwork, but I'll address that later.

The soundtrack which is delivered by Yoshihisa Hirano must be credited. At times it brings a bit of eeriness to certain scenes enhancing the atmosphere. Before I saw this series, it had actually been a good while since I heard a BGM so well used. Every song captures the mood or situation just right. However, for some reason I could never get into the opening and closing themes. They seemed to lack the same flair and never really appeared to fit properly.

Overall, this is a great first half that contains all of the elements to construct a spectacular thriller. Death Note is an exciting series that can more than likely appeal to casual and new anime fans. The series doesn't contain serious graphic violence or sexual situations. The foul language is nothing serious either. It's also not an action series. Therefore, those who only crave over the top action are better off avoiding it. This first season set contains the first 20 episodes with a 500 minute runtime.

Pros: Fantastic visuals, atmosphere, story, plot, characters, suspense, voice work and BGM

Cons: Misa Amane grates on my nerves, loses a tad bit of focus later.",1411862400,,6062,4.708490566037736

Because of this power Light catches the attention of a world famous detective called L, who's deductive skills are that of a genius.

The greatest thing about this show is the acting. I'm serious. The acting of the character Light Yagami deserves an Oscar. He is a complex character, you can see all his emotions on his face and body language: calculating, fear, exaltation, relief, desperate struggle, innocence (at one point), evil gloating. You can see wheels turning in his head. The expressions on his face when his rivals met certain fate were scary and chilling. The cartoon's acting is a hundred times better than the live action movie's acting. I've never seen a cartoon with such great acting, this is the best, bar none.",1398211200,2,854,4.655629139072848

3520875,5,B001CZJP0S,"Death Note is not your typical anime. In fact, it's quite clear from the very first episode that Light Yagami, the protagonist, would be the villain in most other shows. A very compelling one, at that. Such is what makes this series so compelling. You can empathize and care about these characters' lives, while still being aware that the methods they use are repugnant. This creates an interesting dynamic that pervades the show. You grow to care for and root for Light and his companions. But there's a sense of dread that pervades every episode as you're always aware that there are dark forces at work, and that Light's lofty goal to eliminate evil from the world is only being done with the help of a very cursed power.

This dynamic is made even more apparent with the introduction of L, Light's main threat. A quirky and secretive detective, L would probably be the main protagonist in other shows, but in Death Note, he is the main roadblock in Light's way. His oddly likable personality creates a real conflict in the viewer as to which side of the fence they're on and only makes the show even more interesting. L is a prominent character in this first Box Set, which is quite a treat.

The supporting cast are all great as well. I won't spoil anything, but everyone feels human and real. The story itself is always twisting and turning, taking you along for the ride. You'll constantly be guessing where the story will go, and it is clever and well-written enough that when you do figure something out, it is very rewarding. Another way that Death Note is not your typical shonen anime is that it has almost no action. The conflict is mental, not physical. The show favors clever strategy over explosions; wits to swords. While this may displease some fans, it works. There may be no swords or guns, but these are classic shonen battles that rival the best in other series. Overall, this a fantastic first half to a great series.

I also was a fan of the extras. It was enjoyable to see the interviews with the major characters' English voice actors and how they brought the characters to life while maintaining the essence of the original Japanese cast. Hardcore fans who are interested in the dubbing process are in for a treat. The other notable extra was character artwork which was basically an on-disc artbook with production art of the show's main and and supporting cast.",1395187200,,2390,4.658767772511848

3520885,4,B001CZJP0S,"Death Note is a masterpiece. It's anime/manga's like this that proves that it's possible to be intelligent and tasteful and cool and edgy at the same time. The main character is a highly intelligent, bored high school student named Light Yagami, who one day finds a supernatural notebook from the shinigami realm called a Death Note, which has the ability to kill anyone who's name is written in it. He uses the aforementioned notebook to kill criminals and other evil people in order to create a perfect utopia where only those who are good and virtuous will remain and ruled over by none other than himself. As intelligent as he is though, he apparently isn't smart enough to realize or know that power tends to corrupt, and boy does he get corrupted. As he battles wits against his mental foe, the super detective known only as L, Light struggles to maintain his morality and ethics while at the same time killing countless people left and right, even though they're ""bad"" people who deserve to die, eventually he becomes no better than them, and in fact in some ways even worse, which could definitely turn off some viewers from the series who find it hard to sympathize or relate to his goal.

The primary flaw of the series is Misa.  While she should be a gorgeous girl whose looks and fashion hide a seriously messed up psyche, it never really plays out that way.  Her cutesiness overwhelms the dark edge her character should have, and she comes across more as an anime version of Dot Warner than the second Kira.

3520921,5,B001CZJP0S,"DEATH NOTE is considered by many to be the best anime series ever produced, which is quite interesting since it does not contain any plucky underdogs who learn to be a badasses through martial arts training, no magic to be learned by an inexperienced young person or a monstrous tyrant to be defeated-all standard plots of the most popular anime.  DEATH NOTE is something else altogether-a nerve wracking suspense thriller with a supernatural background, full of plot twists too numerous to keep track of and filled with ingenious and diabolical characters.

The basic plot is simple: a brilliant young Japanese man named Light Yagami acquires a notebook that was once the property of a shinigami (a God of Death); writing an individuals name in the book will cause that person to die, thus giving the owner of the book the God like power kill indiscriminately and on a whim.  Light is obsessed with and disgusted by the evil and corruption of modern society, so he sets out to purge those whom he holds responsible by using the Death Note; in the process making himself the God of the New (and better)World. He calls himself Kira (Japanese for killer).

But things do not go that easily for Kira; when criminals start dropping like flies, the police turn to the equally brilliant and eccentric detective known as L to unmask Kira and bring him to justice.  There begins a cat and mouse game between Kira and L as each one tries to get the better of the other. Because his father is a high ranking official in the police department, Light is able to get himself appointed to the task force whose job it is to find and stop Kira, and thus finds himself working along side of his nemesis.  Then there is the other Death Note in the hands of a ditsy young model named Misa Amane.  Miss Amane figures out Kira's real identity and Light has one more problem to contend with; or does he, since Light proves to have a ruthless and uncanny ability to make it all work for himself.  That is except for the problem of the tenacious and super smart L, who won't stop until he discovers Kira's true face.

I've said this is the kind of anime Stephen King might have written; it has the Master of Horror's love of an intricate plot and compelling characters who are not what they seem at first.  There is just enough of a supernatural element to hook horror fans.  Light Yagami is one of anime's great villains, who just happens to be series main characters through whose viewpoint the action unfolds.  L has proven to be huge hit with the fans of this genre, a truly unique, and perhaps sad, character.

The animation is striking, as it creates the proper dark mood, often using a mixture of  black, gray, brown and red to set the mood; never have skyscrapers, offices, highways and bedrooms, where most of the action takes place over the 37 episodes, seemed so ominous and filled with palpable dread.  And its all set to one of the best music scores in all of anime.

Written by Toshiki Inoue and directed by Tetsuro Araki, DEATH NOTE has developed a fanatical following world wide, as the hundreds of thousands of fan fiction stories posted online attest.  There have been a number of live action version produced in Japan and surely there will be a Hollywood version sooner or later.  And surely they will screw it up.  Buy the DVD set and see DEATH NOTE in its original and still best version.",1365638400,,3385,4.574503311258278

3520959,4,B001CZJP0S,"I'm doing this quick review on the box set volume 1 itself because we all know how awesome Death Note is(5/5 stars hands down for the show itself), so I don't really need to touch on that.

The exterior box/case it all comes in is pretty durable. It's a thick cardboard that slides the foldout sleeves out the bottom. It seems to have a decent grip on the sleeve so it doesn't fall out as you pick it up, but also not too much so you have to shake it like a bottle of ketchup.

The discs are all held by a foldout sleeve, which im not a big fan of. It feels kind of cheap, like it will eventually fall apart regardless of how careful I am with it. The discs feel like they are very loose being held in place and the joints seem flimsy.

Extras on the DVDs are OK. It's behind the scenes of the english crew that is split up between each disc. I personally would prefer the japanese crew interviews, but it's still a little interesting. I don't know if the original DVDs came with extras or not.

It took me a long time to find out about the languages on the box set because Amazon only says English. This set does have English/Japanese audio and English subtitles. I rated 4/5 because of the sleeves cheap flimsy feel and lack of japanese behind the scenes content(not the main reason for losing 1 star, I know it's rare to get those options).

If you are careless with your DVDs, I would not recommend getting this. I keep my collection in the best condition I can, but it's only a matter of time until it starts to fall apart.",1352160000,,1528,4.201365187713311

3520961,4,B001CZJP0S,"I had been a Death Note fan for the longest time, but I was always plagued by the fact that it was so dang hard to find it in english.  Hulu and Netflix only had the Japanese version with english subtitles.  Though I still enjoyed the series, I had hoped to be able to watch it without having to read the whole time.  And finally I did something I should've done a long time ago, and bought Death Note Box Set 1.  On terms of the episodes themselves, I'd say I am very pleased with the results.  To be able to watch Death Note on the full screen in Enlgish for the first time  was refreshing.  I'd say the department that the box set cold have used an improvement on was it's apperance and features.  What I mean by that, is that there's no marathon feature and the main menu screen seemed a bit on the lackluster side.  But that's nit picking, and it doesn't really detract from the overall experiance.  I'm really excited because now one of my friends, who wanted to watch Death Note but didn't want to read subtitles the whole time, is finally getting the chance to enjoy one of my favorite shows.  And Box Set 1 ends just at the moment when you, if you haven't seen the series before, don't know what's going to happen next, or what Light's plan is.  To say the least I am definitely buy Death Note Box Set 2 in the future.  Because even after having watched it, I still find myself being sucked into it's crazy plots and cat and mouse game between Light and L.  Buy it!

3520975,5,B001CZJP0S,"Historians of literature tell us that by the time Shakespeare lived his plays and those of his contemporaries were seen by some scholars as a mere distraction for the masses, as cheap and superficial entertainment, lacking the depth and beauty of the great classics. For such scholars a play was as disposable as a political pamphlet or a newspaper: it was something with which one could occupy the mind for a few minutes or hours, but then forget forever. Today everyone knows that the works of Shakespeare are among what the greatest creations in the story of human inventiveness, but the full appreciation of this treasure did not occur overnight.

Let's move now to the anime and manga industry. For many it is only fun for kids, a world of confusion and chaos produced by some crazy people in Japan, which only serves to distract adolescents and childish adults who have not yet fully matured. There is no doubt: a colossal entertainment industry as so would produce a lot of garbage, and it is the case with many productions of anime and manga in Japan; however, there are times when the efforts of writers, designers, voice actors, musicians and etc. unite to produce true masterpieces. Death Note is one of these masterpieces, and any lover of cinema, literature, philosophy and law will be delighted with the human and moral conflict experienced by its characters, a conflict whose stage is the contemporary world, our world of everyday.

I do not want to produce spoilers, so this analysis will focus only on the characters of the two main characters: the young student Light Yagami and the also young detective L. Just to place this review, suffice it to say that the story revolves around a notebook that comes from another world, a world inhabited by something like spiritual and demonic entities called shinigami. One of these Shinigami, bored with the world beyond in which he lives (where nothing interesting ever happens) decides to visit the human world and drop, intentionally, his notebook, hoping that it will be find by some human. This notebook has the power to generate the death of any person in the world, provided that his name be spelled correctly in the pages of the book, and that he who writes has in mind the image of the face of the person that he wish to kill. Thus, two things are necessary for the killing to take effect: correct name + face image. The usage rules are written by the Shinigami on the first page of the Death Note, and so when Light Yagami finds the notebook he has a notion of how to use it. Of course, in principle Light thinks it is a mere joke, but after verifying that the Death Note really works, he decide to kill all the criminals  that he can in an attempt to clean the world. This strange phenomenon (this wave of deaths) leaves the police and secret service all over the world on alert, and they decide to hire the genius detective L to resolve the situation. And so the mental battle between Light and L starts.

Now, the great literature depends more on the creation of characters, the psychological characterization of the people invented, than in a great plot. Death Note has a wonderful and engrossing plot (as in general are all detective stories), but what makes the show a masterpiece able to rival with the great works of literature and film are the two main characters, and I would like to talk a little about them.

First we have the brilliant detective L. Brilliant would be an inappropriate word: L is in fact a young man of genius, the owner of a great brain, with a colossal capacity for logical reasoning. He appears to have a bit of autism: he is closed, quiet, reclusive, but more importantly: he is obsessive. L spends hours and hours in front of computer screens analyzing data and statistics; he also spends hours reading police reports; he reflects tirelessly on the sayings of possible suspects; he analyses information with fanatical strength in every tiny detail of the inquiry, from  the death rates of certain cities to the smallest quirks of the suspects. L is apparently a rich young man, but he always wear light and comfortable clothing, without any pretense of sporting beauty and elegance. He has a wild and careless hair, a skin as white as ivory (perhaps the result of a total absence of sun exposure); his physique seems to match his voice, a voice that is a bit hoarse and cold, as if lifeless. Here are the classic characteristics of a genius in the picture that popular culture has created of the ones that are mentally privileged. At the same time, L has his particular characteristics, so strange and individual that give him a tender and humane touch to his character: he likes chocolate, takes several cups of coffee one after another, and loves sugar. It is a shy boy, but also a leader who knows how to be authoritative and strong when the situation demands it. It is a perfect commander, although he limits his man to a small group of investigators.

L is fascinating, but the greatest character in Death Note in, undeniable, Light Yagami. Light is a perfect young man, a boy who aspires to be the best in everything he does, and that is usually the best. His grades in school are always the highest, his academic performance is in fact possibly the highest in Japan. Moreover, the young man is always well dressed with stylish and beautiful clothes. His features are beautiful too: he is a very handsome boy, a feature which will guarantee him success with girls. Seeing his room, we realize just how regimented the young Light is: everything is perfectly in place, all perfectly arranged. The shelves are abundant in books, and one has the feeling that Light spends hours and hours reading. Light is also a great sportsman, a former tennis champion. All admire him, and love him most: he is the glory of the Japanese youth.

Yet is Light a truly good human being? He speaks to all people with a sweet voice, a voice with an innocent, shy and almost unprotected intonation. But this sweet voice, when speaking alone or when Light thought to himself, becomes a powerful voice, arrogant, the voice of a violent and methodical conqueror. Eventually one discovers that Light does not love anyone, whether his parents and his sister, his girlfriends and friends. He is a man who lives only to achieve his goals, and who will do anything to achieve them. The guilt never enters his brain: Light looks around and sees only creatures of flesh that deserve his contempt, creatures that do not reache his mental level, no one who is so special and high as him. Why then should he respect those abortions? If anyone deserves to be there to judge other people, if anyone deserves to force the world to accept his wishes and desires, that one person is Light Yagami.

It must be noted that the mind of Light is perhaps more powerful than that of L: both have a comparable mental ability. However, L is limited by its difficulty in relating to other people, he is apparently a young man too shy and reclusive, as if he always felt a little ashamed of himself. Light, by contrast, feels at home in any setting: in conversation with any person in any place. He is able to speak naturally and calmly to a hall full of students, and also to sit on a restaurant table with a beautiful young woman and dominate her completely with his falcon gaze, his sweet voice and the manipulative intelligence of his words. Yagami Light is a perfect psychopath: he does not feel guilty about hurting other people; he is resistant to fear and anxiety; he is extremely intelligent and knows how to handle and manipulate all kinds of people; he knows how to adapt to all situations, creating a multitude of disguises for himself.

Yes, Yagami Light will execute a multitude of human beings without mercy (of course, in general these will be murderers, thieves, corrupt politicians, rapists, etc.), and this can be qualified as morally wrong. But then, how can we demand that a so perfect human being (a man endowed with all the various skills consecrated by the history of mankind) cannot become himself intoxicated with power? How can we demand that so powerful mind cannot imagine himself to be a fit judge, a demi-god prepared to make all mankind sit it in the dock, to make all the human lives be the defendants in this gigantic trial? It is a complex issue. Light is, after all, superior to all other men and women in the world of Death Note, and he knows it; is by no means unusual that such a mind, that such an intellect should get itself drunk with its own perfection. There are some early scenes in Death Note in which Light Yagami looks around (to school friends, to people on the street, to TV shows) and believes that the majority of human beings, because of their mediocrity, should simply disappear from existence. In many people, the freedom to think that, to perform this kind of trial would be an exaggeration (as they will be themselves mediocre), but in one so superior as Light such judgment does not seem to be all wrong: sometimes we fell that he has the right to judge the vast majority of human life as mere statues of flesh, mere oxen, with no beauty or creativity in their minds.

However, Light is not God, and it's not up to him to judge others (this is the opinion of the majority of viewers and readers of Death Note). But Light is brave, a courageous thinker. At one point of the anime he expresse the view that after death human beings do not migrate to  heaven or  hell, but just march into nothingness: into the void. Thus, major criminals are not punished after their death, and with that in mind their must cease to exist as soon as possible. If the holder of the Death Note was a person less intelligent, less ambitious, less cold, less logical, the program would not be the masterpiece that it is. However, the character of Yagami Light is the gear that makes the show the wonder that it is. For me, Light Yagami is a character comparable to the creations of Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Shakespeare. It is a great invention of the human creative spirit.

I gave five stars to Death Note, but I confess that for a time I considered the possibility of giving it four stars because I think the show loses in quality with the appearance of the characters of Mello and Near: it is as up to about half in its length Death Note was a work of universal scope, later becoming intoxicated by many common features of Japanese animation , something like childish and artificial characterizations (Near and Mello are examples of such flawed characterizations). Light and L, however, are among the best that has been produced in character creation, in the world of anime and manga and also in the world of universal literature.

3520981,3,B001CZJP0S,"I'm not going to review the show itself or write about how great the story line is, we all know that Death Note is good, I'm reviewing the packaging and the box set itself, which I was disappointed in.

The placeholders for the individual DVDs are extremely flimsy and as a result, the DVDs constantly slip out, this was the biggest problem I had with this boxed set. It gets annoying when you pick up the set and open it and the DVDs fall out and can get damaged because of it. They should have taken the time to make them sturdier so they could hold the DVDs in place.

Well since I couldn't afford the individual DVDs this is the best I could get, the price was reasonable. I don't mind buying box sets, but when the cases are made so flimsy and careless, it makes me afraid and cautious to want to get another anime box set, and I can't exactly afford individual DVDs.

It's unfortunate, but only the Death Note box set vol 1 is the only anime set I've bought that has such shoddy craftsmanship. Other boxed sets I've bought have always been of higher quality, perhaps they are trying to cut costs wherever possible.

The show is definitely 5 stars up until episode 25 where in my opinion should of ended, the rest of the show seems a bit tacked on.

Anyway I could only give this 3 stars on account of the set itself.",1330300800,7,1322,4.272

3520983,5,B001CZJP0S,"I remember of hearing of this anime from word of mouth and i decided to see what all the hype was all about. I fell in love with it. It's so good.

The story is that a high schooler, Light Yagami is walking home from school one day and while walking home comes across a ""Death Note"" which looks like a journal. He brings it home and while in his room a shinigami appears and explains that the reason he (light) got the death note is because the shinigami, Ryuk was bored and wanted to see what human would take it.

Light wants to rid the world of evil and he tried it out while watching the news he wrote down a criminal's name which killed the criminal. After that he started using the Death Note rapidly until it caught atteniton of the FBI and they hired some very skilled detective (but somewhat strange) named L. Who is trying to catch Kira (Light but they don't know Light did it, they think it could be anyone so they are naming that person as Kira) and than it becomes a game of cat and mouse.

I would recomend the Japanese voices of the English because the English seemed kind of cheesy to me. The artwork in the show is also very good.

So if you haven't seen the show you should see it.",1319673600,,1199,4.155172413793103

You still have to appreciate fantasy to appreciate Death Note though. A straight shot at japanese myth and legend  thrown into the real world makes for excitement. there is no other word for it. In place of blood and gore and action and violence (not that there isn't any violence) you have a maze suspense that will keep you on edge. Look past the fact that it is animation and then you will see how brilliant the series is.  Well written, well directed and well voiced.

I started watching the first couple episodes when I was bored one summer morning, and I ended up watching the entire series in one day.  I'm not exactly proud of this, but I'm just saying that it's addicting.  The plot is very dark, and I found some of it to be pretty weird at first (like the Shinigami, Ryuk) but you get used to him.  Other anime shows that I like are Dragon Ball and One Piece. However, Death Note is nothing like either of those shows, but I thought I should list some of my other preferences to give you (the reader) an idea of other series that I have watched.  I will say that I enjoyed the first half of the series more (that could be because I watched it in one sitting) but every episode was still enjoyable and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It's a short series, so you don't have to devote a lot of time to it like some other shows.  That's about all I can say without spoiling any of the series.  Give this show a shot, though.  Maybe watch the first couple episodes online. The end of the second episode was what got me hooked.",1307404800,7,1152,4.107142857142857

3520994,5,B001CZJP0S,"I am one disc in upon writing this, and already I am 100% satisfied with spending $80 on the complete series!

First off I was expecting Death Note to be sort of a ""horror"" story along the lines of ""The Ring"" where the characters would be spending most of the time trying to keep their names out of the 'Death Note'. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when the main character 'Light' begins filling the book with names of criminals in an attempt to change the world for the better... Nice idea, except the kind of power the 'Death Note' grants is the kind of power that quickly gets out of control, and it does for Light quicker than I expected.

Like I said I'm one disc in and I'm hooked! I can't wait to see how the deaths of so many major criminals begins to change the world, and I can't wait to see how deep into darkness Light plunges!

If you're an Anime fan or are just looking for something different, give 'Death Note' a shot. It won't disappoint!

*UPDATE WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!* Ok, I finished the series, and I just have to say that I was just a little bit disappointed with the ending.... I guess I wanted Light to win. This doesn't change my rating, the journey to the ending was awesome! I just hoped that I would get to see the ""bad guy"" win this one, because after all he had the right idea... Until he started killing FBI & cops that is! Final verdict 'Death Note' is one of the better Anime I've seen and I am very glad to have it in my collection!",1302739200,,1469,4.235714285714286

3521002,5,B001CZJP0S,"The Death Note series is, in a word, about power. The book in which the series is named after is normally a possession of what is called a ""shinigami"" also known as a ""death god"" in our language. They, unfortunately, have this unique negligence when it comes to their Death Notes. They tend to lose them. Once lost they become visible to the human eye and can be scooped up by any passer-by at which point in time the powers of the Death Note are then in their hands. In this case, the Death Note falls into the hands of one Yagami Light. Light is an uncommonly smart young man who is rather innocent at first. His fall from innocence comes from using the book and his interactions with the shinigami who once possessed it: Ryuk. Ryuk is an interesting character. Though he looks fearsome, he is rather fond of apples (Garden of Eden anyone?) and he is there to lighten the mood for a good portion of the series (Misa, Light's girlfriend who is only his girlfriend so that he can use her, also becomes a comical character).

The book comes with instructions on how to use it and Light gives it a try. The main purpose is to, simply, kill. Once Light realizes that it does just that he begins to formulate the idea of a perfect world. A world without crime or jails because all insurrections are punishable by death from the one wielding the Death Note. He takes on the pseudonym Kira and a game of wits begins. Light's father is a police officer and he begins working with L, who is an exceptionally bright young man with bags under his eyes and a desire for all things sweet tasting. To make things worse Light also joins forces with L and his father to capture Kira while at the same time redirecting L's attentions and trying to throw him off his trail. This creates for a nail biting, edge of your seat, series that gets better with each episode.

Light becomes lost in what Kira represents and his innocence is completely swallowed up in the possession of power. Others, as the series progresses, also gain this power and it is seen as being used in many different ways. The peculiarities of the series is that even though we know what Kira/Light is doing is wrong we root for him. Wouldn't we, also, want to create a world where you didn't have to be afraid to walk out of your house? And yet it's just another form of being a killer. He, too, is a mass murderer and should be held responsible by his own tactic.

The allure of this series comes from this pull of emotions and from the brilliant dance between L and Light as they come ever closer to the apex of contact. There's never a dull moment!",1294617600,,2605,4.378099173553719

Read all the reviews before making your decision, if you have younger, impressionable children.

Our 15-year old talked me into buying this first set and I did not research it as I should have.  Our family likes lighter anime, so while this series is extremely well-done in many respects, we felt we had to ""hang in"" til the last episode because we wanted closure on what became of the characters only to find we had to buy Death Note 2 (as it's sold on Amazon) for an additional 4 episodes to learn what became of L and Light.

3521005,5,B001CZJP0S,"I began watching the TV show Death Note in either July or August, whenever it first came to ITunes. Just watching the 30 second preview for the very first episode was enough to make me hooked and I had to watch it from beginning to end and I am very glad I did. I started out by watching it for free on mega video, but it was so good I just had to buy both parts on iTunes. Death Note was essentially the first anime I had ever watched and I therefore watched the dubbed version as watching in a different language with subtitles just didn't appeal to me. That and the fact the English Dubbed version has just about the best possible voice actors ever. I'm not quite sure why I loved Death Note so much, whether it was the brilliant writing and intelligent characters, the original storyline, the great animation, the amazing music, or the convincing voice actors but I am obsessed with it. In my opinion, no TV show comes even close to the stature of Death Note.

So to conclude, no TV show has captivated me quite like death note perhaps because it had the perfect level of suspension of disbelief required and this is a key component for almost all TV shows even complete fantasy like Gurren Lagann and the other reasons I mentioned in my first post. Howver, other shows have succeeded more in manipulating my emotions such as Gurren Lagann, Fullmetal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop, and Ouran High School Host club, because they made you really care about the characters, the one area that Death Note didn't excel in as much.

Nevertheless, i found out that the DVD couldn't be played in my DVDplayer because the latter was programmed to function in region 1  while my country was part of region 2.  Fortunately, i was able to watch it in my computer which also explained to me all this stuff i hadn't heard about before and allowed me to change Regions in order to run Death Note -even if only for 4 times-. To sum it up, Japan and Europe (along with other countries) consist Region 2, while USA and Canada are Region 1. There is a total of about 5 Regions. So, before bying this extraordinary DVD or any other DvD from abroad make sure your home stereo player is able to reproduce it. On the other hand, if your pc can do the job well... good for you :)

My review may be short and sweet but take my word that this series has a very engaging story that I have now watched several times. To me the plot kicks the crap out of any mystery/drama that is out today in any genre. Sadly people like me will most likely be turned away by the fact that it's anime. This may sound like an unlikely link but I find the story structure similar to the Dexter series, mostly because Death Note is also a story of a cat and mouse game. L & Light are two characters that really show careful thought and planning to gain the upper hand.

3521016,5,B001CZJP0S,"of all time. ""Death Note"" is about Light Yagami, a bored, highly-intelligent, 17-year-old high school student who is the son of a police chief. One day, Ryuk (a Shinigami - ""death god""), who is also bored decides to drop a ""Death Note"" into the human realm. Any person's name who is written in the Death Note either dies, (which depends on whether the cause of death is specified or not.) Light  discovers the ""Death Note,"" and wants to become the ""God of a New World."" Under the alias ""Kira"", Light uses the note to kill off criminals and ""bad people,"" but his new power quickly corrupts him. L Light begins to kill off law enforcement agents and anyone standing in the way of his goals.

The police and public doesn't know who Kira is, but Ryuzaki (aka L) is  --  is a brilliant detective determined to stop Kira's killings and bring him to justice. The battle of wits between Kira and L is intense. The viewer is always left wondering who will outwit the other. But just when the intensity begins to sear, it's lightened unexpectedly with humor (like in the episode ""Wager."")

I've already watched this box set more than three times, and replaying favorite episodes or moments from the show.

The episode ""Makeshift,"" sums up the tension between Light and L.

Light asks L/Ryuzaki, staring in his eyes (with conviction), ""Ryuzaki, Do you think I'm actually capable of becoming a murderer, Kira?"" Light asks, ""Even after I help you catch him? Do I seem like that kind of person to you?""

""Yes, you do,"" Ryuzaki replies calmly, ""I've always thought so.""

Afterward, the two begin fighting.

Seiyuu (Voice Actor) Brad Swaile strikes the perfect balance of the detestable, likeable faux-squeaky clean as Light Yagami, Alessandro Juliani does a brilliant job of portraying L, Shannon Chan-Knight does a wonderful job as ""Misa Amani.""",1258156800,2,1831,4.802547770700637

It manages to grab my attention all the time, you don't encounter much anime that does that.  Everything about it is great.

3521018,5,B001CZJP0S,"There are many quality anime's these days and as they keep coming out it seems only a very select few really have anything new to offer to the genre. Usually the cliche good versus evil with extremely intense action is the path of most anime's. Many of the Drama based anime's are set in a high school setting and/or are based toward the female audience retaining toward romance. Death Note defies all and steps outside the boundaries bringing something new, fresh and intellectual to the table... Depth. Caution, some spoilers ahead.

The main protagonist Light is introduced as a very intelligent young man and his character actually portrays that cunning very well. Later after coming into possession of the Death Note and in complete understanding of it's abilities he still remains clever enough to keep his true identity hidden while under the persona of Kira. You truly find yourself torn as to whether Light's intentions are pure or sinister as he first uses his power against the 'evil' in the world but later he begins using it to save his own skin. Watching his character slowly progress into something darker was truly an intense roller coaster all on it's own, but the inclusion of L only stresses the situation and twists the plot.

L (yes as in the letter), is an odd, mysterious man whom for years has solved many crimes without ever showing his face. L comes off as extremely eccentric, collected yet maddened by his own intellect. Though he and Light are contrasted as opposites on outward appearances the two are in fact one in the same as far as cunning and intelligence. It is these two characters that drive the series with the Death Note simply being the link that forces them to a battle of wits. This is easily one of the best rivalries I have ever seen in a anime and consistently found myself on the edge of the seat each time the two interacted with one another.

The Death Note could use a bit of describing as well. It is a journal made by and originally owned by a God of War. The possessor needs only write a persons name in it while picturing the persons face and seconds later the person dies. One can also choose how the being dies and even decide when and control the persons actions up to their untimely demise. Further more the God of War that previously owned the Death Note is bound to any human that possess' the Death Note and follows him or her around and is only visible to those who touch the Death Note.

All in all it should be obvious that I was impressed with the series. The character interaction between Light and L is very intense and the game of cat and mouse portrayed is a nail biting suspense unlike any anime I have ever seen. The plot is thick with numerous twists as well as various interesting characters and a good deal of action to keep the storytelling intense. Simply a great anime that should be at the top of every anime fans must own list. I would also advise getting the second set with this, you'll end up buying it anyways. A very dark, very well written and extremely well acted anime that for a person who has watched hundreds of animes can honestly say this may well be the best of the best.",1256083200,,3164,4.506968641114983

I would recommend this series to anyone who sits at the edge of their seats during suspenseful parts in movies. If you are a person like this then you fall off the edge of your seat about 5 times an episode. Though this might be an exaggeration this series is really good.

At first I watched it and to not make spoilers its a great series that uses a lot of good techniques to trap the audience with good cliff hangers, a unique story, and character developement that is pretty good along side this all. They do awesome camera angles only found in better animes and have fun twisting things around making it confusing but very entertaining.

In the end you have death note, a good series and if you have people who aren't familiar with anime this is one that could get them hooked...",1252454400,2,895,4.347305389221557
3521021,5,B001CZJP0S,"Death Note is unusual for a series structured on supernatural elements. I can only recommend this series if you are prepared to concentrate and think about what is happening in the storyline, which often takes devious detours that at first don't make sense but later become key in the telling of the tale. This is not a drama that you can relax and just watch, you have to be engaged in understanding the thinking of the characters or you will lose sight of what is happening. The plot is magnificent in how it dives very very deep into the mind of the main character to expose the weakness of his soul, hidden behind the cool calm exterior of a young man who ""seems"" to always be in control of his life. Light Yagami ( also referred to as Kira in the story ... a cover name under which he commits his crimes ...)is a brilliant but bored, distracted, dissatisfied student ( though it's not really clear... he appears to be a high school senior... ) who longs for something to make his life interesting, and to give him control over his destiny.  He has a random encounter one day with a supernatural artifact called The Death Note, a rather ordinary looking notebook that seems to have simply fallen from the sky to land in the school courtyard.  He picks it up, reads the instructions inside the cover that explain how the power of the Death Note is activated, and from that point on the story becomes one of Light grappling with himself over how to use the Power over life and death that has been placed in his hands. Initially he tests it, and is shocked to see that it actually works as the instructions describe, and he is startled and a little shaken at the fact that he has so easily committed murder without anyone having the slightest suspicion. From that point on this becomes a study in how absolute power can thoroughly corrupt the human soul. The message seems to be that no person was ever meant to have this sort of power and that there is no way to avoid innocent deaths in its exercise. Light grows increasingly frantic during the episodes as he tries to cover his trail and at the same time carry out the murders which, in his own mind, he has convinced himself are warranted.  He becomes judge, jury and executioner of any and all who stand in his way.  The introduction of ""L"" , the mysterious young detective who is expertly hunting ""Kira"" ( Light's cover name )... serves well as a foil to push Light further and further to the edge of mental breakdown. This is a sad story in many ways, watching the self destruction of a young man as he tortures himself mentally into believing that he is a God and that his sweeping murders are ordained by heaven.  The climax and ending of the series is as painful and disturbing as the story buildup itself, though probably not completely unexpected. Yes, there is a definite ending to the tale, and you will know it when you see it. It involves a final heart rending and devastating confrontation between Light and ""L"".  The series ""tries"" to continue on after that climax, but fails to be inspirational any further.  It is very worthwhile watching the first 25 episodes, but again, be prepared to be engaged in the plot, or don't bother at all. The rewards are great if you pay attention and follow all the details of the story, you simply can not view this series in a casual manner and enjoy it very much. As for the production quality, the animation is very detailed and fluid, putting a lot of focus on the facial expressions and eyes of the characters as they go through a range of emotions, the artwork is very expressive and draws you into the perspective of the series. The opening theme music is exciting and powerful and fits the mood and pace of the series. The disks themselves functioned perfectly, I encountered no problems with the performance of the media.

WARNING, SPOILERS!

**************************************
I'm not a big fan of moral dilemmas and I hated Light from the very beginning. But it was my intense dislike of him that had me hooked all the way to the end and had me cheering for Ryuk (easily my favorite character in the whole series) and laughing at Light as he died with that ""Whuh?"" look on his face. I liked his death more in the manga (whining and screaming in abject terror), but it was still a good end to a character I absolutely love to hate.
***************************************

SPOILERS END.

What didn't I like about this anime? Subtitles.
I can't say I'm partial to either subs or dubs. I can go either way. Whichever one sounds more natural is typically what I'll watch. Unfortunately the subtitles are quite vague and not nearly as colorful in their descriptions as the dubbing. The biggest drawback to all of this is that if you want to watch the dubbed version, there is no ""text-only"" option for subtitles. As you can probably guess, there is quite a TON of Japanese text in this series. This means that you have to watch the dubbed version with subtitles ON if you want to know what anything says. This can get very distracting.
But I can't complain about having to watch it in Japanese since it's still great voice-acting, and I love Aya Hirano.

So for fans of dubs, it's easily a 99.5 out of 100.
And as for you purists, go out and buy it NOW.",1242259200,,1755,4.778877887788779

3521026,5,B001CZJP0S,"There's no question 'Death Note' is one of the most original and addicting anime's ever created. Aside from a few bits here and there, there are none of the usual anime trappings (angry girls with giant hammers, overly horny main characters, too-good-to-be-true protagonists, teenagers working obscure occupations).In fact you could call Death Note the anti-anime that presents serious situations for it's characters and treats each situation with a level of respect (for the audience as WELL as the characters).

This DVD set includes the first five volumes previously released in individual cases and carry the same exrtra's (making's of, interviews). Too me these first 20 episodes were Death Note's high point. They introduced the main players (Light, L, Misa Misa, the special investigations team) and the main plot surrounding a notebook that can kill people by writing their name in it (as well as several obscure rules for the writer to follow). Also where these episodes shined was the rivalry/battle-of-wits between Light and L (the two main characters). This to me was the core of the series and when it was brought to it's conclusion in second season (episode 25,about 2/3rds of the way through the series) I felt the show lost alot of it's impact.

Again if you don't own the individual volumes already this is the perfect box set for any Death Note fan, or any animation fan looking for a more mature title that doesn't involve the usual anime trappings.",1238112000,,1468,5.037037037037037

3521030,5,B001CZJP0S,"Deathnote is simply an amazing anime series that challenges our perception of what is truly good or evil.  In a nutshell, the protagonist, Light Yagami, finds a notebook called a 'Deathnote'.  Thinking it is a prank, he writes the name of a criminal in it, and is surprised when the criminal dies suddenly.  He tests the notebook a couple of more times to be sure, then goes on a killing spree, executing serious criminals and wanted men.

Despite his benevolent desire to create a better world with no crime; the public is divided, with police and much of the public fearful of his power.  A small part of the population cheers him on in online blogs, but they are too fearful to openly support him.

What is interesting is that the viewer tends to either side with his motives or not. So the question is: is he hero or villain?

The series is very cat and mouse, being 'Kira' (Light Yagami) and 'L', who leads the investigation, continue to chase one another.  Kira tries to discover who L is so that he may execute him and L tries to discover who Kira is so that he may capture him and end the killings.

So the plot is intersting, but what about the quality?  Animation is fluid and clean with an interesting selection of colors.  Often when Kira is performing killings, the colors are dull and dark; while Kira is at school everything is bright and cheery.  It tends to set the mood appropriately.

The soundtrack also suits the plot and theme very well. The series has a whole 'celestial choir' feel to the music (except the intro and closing songs).

Characters are very interesting and very well portrayed.  Some of the characters can become irritating at times, though it all is part of the greater plot (Misa is in particular a rather irritating girl).  The Shinigami (Death Gods) that protect the Deathnote are also very interesting and original.  In particular, Ryuk provides a touch of comedy refief at times.

Overall I give this 5/5 though there are a few episodes where the show tends to grind down and putter along (parts of disc 3 mainly), but the series picks up the pace again with disc 4.

I hate to put this up against the fantasy/sci-fi animes such as Fullmetal Alchemist and Last Exile (which are destined to be classics and the best of the best), but this series does squeak into my top 10!  Well worth a watch!",1230422400,,2336,4.543062200956938
3521031,5,B001CZJP0S,"If you have always wanted to start watching Death Note or buy it, this is what you need to get. The price is great when others have paid around $20 for each Volume. That means that you get the first five volumes for about half price. Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time and you really can't beat this price. The characters are very relatible and the story does a great job at pulling the viewer in.",1230249600,,428,4.168674698795181
3521032,3,B001CZJP0S,"What would you do if you suddenly realized you had the power to take life? Well the TV series of Death Note could teach you a thing or two. Light Yagami is an anti social prodigy that suffers from inner torment of unjustice in the world. Suddenly he comes across a strange notebook called The Death Note. Suddenly he realizes that he has the power to re-shape the world in his image, by taking the lives of criminals, rapists, murderers and all those that pose a threat to a safe world. All goes well until the police and international security teams start realizing that the mystrious constant death of evil people is not right. It is now up to Light to keep his tracks hidden from Super-cop 'L' who keeps getting closer and closer.

This show really has alot of promise. It is the first Anime I have seen that blends fantasy with true white knuckle suspence and police stories. Unfortunatly while the first few episodes are nothing short of brilliant as the story goes on the enjoyment goes down the tubes. After the character of Misa is introduced there are points where I just get sick to my stomach. The diologue gets terrible the story gets boring and there are moments when I just want to hurl the remote control at my television. I feel that the show was too long, which was the reason why there are parts of the show I dispised. The ending while I don't want to give it away was something that could have been done so much better. They could have put much better stories in the show for time fillers like back stories and character origins.

I know there are plenty of people out there that do love this show and for that all the power to you. After seeing this show from begining to end and being a fan of most anime I am glad that I did get to see the show, but it's just not my cup of tea.",1229990400,6,1801,4.294117647058823

Id say a show Definitely worth Owning.

Overall Rating 4/5
A notebook falls from the sky and this if found by a bored, high school genius Light Yagami.  The rules written on the inside cover include the title of this review, ""The human whose name is written in this note shall die.""

It's a story about shinigami, death gods, and one student who believe's he's the best judge, jury, and executioner.  An amazing show that pits the clever and dangerous Light Yagami against the great and secretive detective ""L"".  For a show that has this much death, there really isn't many fights to speak of.  The battle of wit and cunning drive the show to a unique drama and intensity that really can't be missed.

This is set 1 of 2.  The total show has 39 episodes.  I cant say I know the exact episode but part way there is a major change.  Ignore what you may have read online.  The show completes at 39.  It's still a solid show after this major event and of course it doesn't conclude until the end...

Theme Songs 4/5
This series has some great music, a good opening and ending. Fast paced, I didn't skip them.

Ending 4/5
