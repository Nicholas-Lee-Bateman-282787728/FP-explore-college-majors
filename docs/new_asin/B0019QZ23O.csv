8275066,4,B0019QZ23O,This used to air as an HBO Special back in the early eighties. I watched it just about every time it came on during the month of October and the two times it aired in early November. It remained a fond memory until I found out it was on VHS. I promptly ordered it for my birthday. It isn't as good as I remember but still a fun treat.,1350864000,,334,3.8550724637681157
