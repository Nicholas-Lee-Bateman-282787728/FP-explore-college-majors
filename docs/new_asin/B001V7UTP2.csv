3819810,4,B001V7UTP2,"""Reclaiming the Blade"" is an apt name for this film.  It is a primer on the history, use, and cultural impact of the sword in Europe.  Unlike in Asia, this knowledge seemed lost since the introduction of gunpowder.  It is, however, starting to be recovered from the instructional treatises being found in old libraries across the continent.

This knowledge is important to understanding European culture and why it was so intimately linked to the sword as a symbol of power and honor, something that continues to this day.",1250294400,2,522,4.8977272727272725

3819812,5,B001V7UTP2,"Whether your interest is in history, martial arts or the movies, this amazing documentary is for you. Reclaiming the Blade carefully chronicles the history of the sword and swordsmanship in the West and explains the ongoing fascination with the sword as evidenced by its presence in our culture, and especially our movies.  Included in this feature length documentary are extensive interviews by the actors and props creators of Lord of the Rings, as well as extensive interviews with the legendary Bob Anderson, the Hollywood swordmaster who has instructed and choreographed the most famous sword fights in film history.

3819813,5,B001V7UTP2,"I recently watched Reclaiming the Blade, a documentary about swords and the romanticism that surrounds them. I had been tracking the progress of the film through its website, eagerly anticipating the release of the movie. I was very excited when it was released and I purchased it within days of it becoming available. I was very happy that the delivery was quick so that I could view it without waiting too long.

When the movie first started I was disappointed as it seemed to be based on hyperbole and worse still it appeared that the history of swords was brushed over quickly to concentrate on sword use in movies. I figured that since I had bought the DVD that I would keep watching it; and I am glad that I did. While the movie comments were interesting that was not why I bought the documentary.

In my opinion, the documentary really took off after the the swords in the movies section. It dealt with swords and also Western Martial Arts. The movie did not try to argue superiority issues between Eastern and Western Martial Arts, it just pointedout that Europe had a tradition of martial arts, which were written about extensively at the time. Western Martial Arts were 'lost' with the coming of firearms that reduced the need to have skill in favour of masses of muskets firing simultaneously. The documentary had a Kundo instructor who gave his view about Western and Eastern Martial Arts. He summed up the difference perfectly when he stated that Eastern Martial Arts were more esoteric than Western Martial Arts.

The experts consulted about Western Martial Arts were clear that the tradition of the European styles was about killing, and it did not matter how attractively it was done. One of the experts, the legendary Hank Reinhardt, related the story of when he was sparring using Western Martial Arts techniques with a sports fencer and grabbed the blade of the fencer. The fencer objected because that movewas against the rules, to which Reinhadt retorted that in a fight to the death nothing was illegal.

The movie also lookedat the making of swords, focusing on the modern work of the late Paul Champagne. Mr Champagne worked with traditional techniques to create traditional style blades and had very good insights in to how swords may have been made. The documentary also looked at the remains of a medieval sword found in England that was made of several metals, demonstrating that western swords were not just simple pounded metal.

I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary especially once it passed the movie section. It was great seeing the passion that people showed for investigating Western Martial Arts. The film did not try to prove the superiority of Western Martial Arts over Asian Martial Arts, it merely stated that both existed and are both worthy of study. The documentary was also not just about people bashing each other with swords it also let the academics speak about their research. If you are interested in swords, especially European medieval or Renaissance era swords then this is a documentary that you will enjoy. I also believe that its well paced format will appeal to a broader audience.",1246924800,28,3137,4.867041198501872
3819814,5,B001V7UTP2,"Background: I'm a retired military officer, and a serious student of military history. This superb film explores the medieval/Renaissance history of the sword, and by extension, European martial arts of the period. It breaks the study down into sections such as: how we view the sword today, particularly as reflected in movies; The actual history of the sword; and modern research, both scholarly and active to recreate the sword and its use. It has long annoyed me that the history of Western combat has been lost, and even falsified. It is incredible to believe that warriors of the period were simply flailing about with no skill at arms. Their lives, their honor, the well-being of their families, their religion, etc all depended on getting it right, yet most history books would have you believe that they possessed no skills beyond a blind courage. This very well done film provides the viewer with an introduction to the sword, and is an excellent starting point for further research. The experts and enthusiasts who are interviewed infect the viewer with their spirit and their knowledge. This is a film long overdue.",1240444800,66,1127,5.0

I admit I didn't expect to like it but, surprisingly, I did.  I came away with the impression that swordsmanship is as much an art as a sport.  I'd hazard to say, that while most of us would know little of our ancestry during the time of the sword, most of us owe a debt of gratitude to someone way back who was successful with a sword.",1484179200,2,486,4.239130434782608

3819830,1,B001V7UTP2,"Upon seeing this title in the Prime listings, I was excited to learn some ""history"" about perhaps humanity's most iconic weapon. Instead, I was treated, first, to a silly paean to the sword as a symbol of ""freedom"" (really? freedom?), followed by a when-will-it-end montage of classic swordfighting scenes from the last seventy-five years of cinema. I mean, it went on, and on...and on. Very quickly it became apparent that this was not  a ""history"" of the sword, but some kind of mash-up of stunt choreography involving swords, and some dodgy history thrown in for good measure. It could have been so much better, as some of the experts that were interviewed seemed on the verge to elaborate on some interesting point just before the director cut away to yet another behind-the-scenes look at the stunt rehearsals for ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"". This would all have been well and good, had the movie been titled ""The Sword in the Cinema"" or something along those lines. I felt cheated out of the twenty minutes I spent waiting for this thing to get good, and the only reason I'm spending the time writing this now is to perhaps prevent some other sucker from wasting his or her time.

3819868,2,B001V7UTP2,"They go on to blame Hollywood and the audience that apparently wants to see more samurai sword like fight scenes. Okay they have a point well at least with the first part. You can probably blame the film industry for that and blame them for leaving out Western martial arts for epic fight scenes but they should have done a better job telling the audience that Eastern/Oriental,Asian swordsmanship was not to blame for this which they chose not to really do. They addressed this topic in a part of the movie which would indicate they have a valid reason to be upset about, but then they revisited the issue in more interviews and conversations by panelist and other practitioners through out the rest of the movie.

They could have done a better job telling us that the ""other"" sword guys weren't exactly beating their chest and throwing a parade for their swords and styles. They did what they had to do because it was a part of their identity that they felt was dying. But you didn't get that with the lengthy four minute interview and two experts that they consulted....
They kind of also forgot that that the movie industry has demonstrated plenty of appreciation towards Western martial arts and the immortalizing of medieval life and swordsmanship in films and television series such as: The Tudors, The Musketeer, Braveheart, Gladiator, Arthur, First Knight, Spartacus, Troy, and so on. So how is it that the Eastern, Oriental swords culture  or whatever the terms is gets more love? Was it by a movie like Last Samurai, Which was about a Western man by the way, or Crouching Tiger, maybe even Blade? Really, that's about it. I think the audience knows that knights are cool and they have their place in history.

Perhaps the film should have acknowledgement that the appreciation they get is better than nothing because their favorite sword style still gets way more love than any others...",1330128000,,1898,4.780487804878049

3819870,3,B001V7UTP2,"I really wanted to like this documentary. In the end I did but only just. Firstly the good things. The interviews with the stars such as Viggo Montesson and sword masters Bob Anderson were great. The documentary is nicely paced and keeps the viewers attention throughout, which multiple personalities given their view on all things swordy. While DVD's on oriental martial arts and techniques are two a penny, `Western' martial arts are comparatively rare, so the documentary would have been a welcome addition no matter. The camera work is crisp and well made and the plethora of different scenes were Historical and classical practitioners show their excellent skills is riveting, an I concur that the more these techniques are incorporated in movies the better appreciation for western techniques will drip down into the public consciousness.
What ruined it was the overt diatribe that started to kick in a third of the way through the movie. For those uninitiated in the way of the sword, Historical and classical fencing has two bug bears: its hatred of the fact that FIE fencing gets a spotlight in the Olympics and that somehow it has nothing to do with swordplay and that Oriental martial arts are rightly or wrongly seen as superior at least in the public mind to the western tradition.
The first that of its disdain for sport fencers is getting tiresome now. I know of no Olympic fencer who has been marginally successful who has gone to competitions that entertains illusions that somehow their practice with a foil/epee/sabre makes them fully combat ready for a real swordfight, especially a melee (But somehow Classical/Historical fencers have got it into their head that they do) But to disparage it almost as an aberration in that it has no direct ties to the past is either disingenuous or plain lying. Partly because in Italy and France there HAS been a direct connection right through the 19th and 20th century, partly because the program makes light of the reason why fencing died out or evolved in Europe - namely ballistic weapons. FIE Olympic fencing is a combat sport that evolved out of the changing social norms and the REALITY of warfare. Namely that all the other western martial branches on the tree died out by NECESSITY  but the smallword/sabre branch did survive albeit in a very limited format and that this is not in itself a bad thing. Olympic events for the ancient pentathlon also had a great deal of artificial rules attached to the skills of a greek warrior, but did that make the athlete divorced entirely from the martial forms practiced in their contemporary Greece?  But a great deal of the blame has to be laid to the door of George Silver, the master of defence who decried the use of the rapier in England as somehow destroying buckler and shortsword tradition. From his xenophobic broadsides lies the seed of this disagreement...namely that historical/classical fencers especially those of a `Anglo Saxon' background see sport fencing as a aberration that should have never occurred and carry many misconceptions about the sport, while many in Continental Europe see it as a eventual evolution, a paring down of an art that no-longer has place `except' as a sport in modern society, which some can successfully argue was from a social aspect a great shame especially since the far east retained their more traditional forms.

The mis-conception is plainly demonstrated when one of the commentators says that sport fencers hold the non sword arm back for balance. What century is this guy in? I know few sport fencers who actually believe this. The left hand is primarily held back to keep minimise the target area the opponent can hit. Parrying with the hand opens more of the target area, which with a duo tempo tool like a foil puts you at a disadvantage. Likewise when many people complain that sport fencing is held on a strip, it's mainly because as one of my Italian instructors pointed out, the speed and lightness of a fencing foil/epee/sabre makes dodging/body displacement impractical because the blade moving in a straight line nearly is always faster than a sidestep, inquartata, volte or passata sotto, so the fight nearly always turns linear. If it was a rapier of course it would be different. But oh no...the strip is an entirely artificial consideration apparently not connected to any practical considerations of the foil.

Their diatribe against the far east, namely that in the public eye Eastern Esoteric martial arts are inherently superior is born out of at best a fear that there is a unquestioning acceptance that japan/china do it better (which is warranted) and at worse a jealousy that they have stolen the show and made a great deal of money out of it. This may well change in the future.

3 stars. I wish these guys well. Sport fencers want to practice a combat sport that has its roots in the European smallsword/sabre tradition, but ultimately because they enjoy the competition and the battle of wits and physicality on the strip within the tight rule set that define the sport. A bit like Olympic Karate. But Historical fencers need to ask themselves whether their laudable pursuit is for the recreation of the arts `in themselves' or as a reaction to a imagined other, namely Sport Fencers who are happy with the limitations of their sport or Oriental martial art practitioners whose esoteric  approach to their art may have made it more commercially acceptable to popular culture.

If you want a interesting documentary on swordplay, especially western forms then this is a little gem. But those who practice Olympic fencing or oriental forms might find it preachy or just a bit swivel eyed.",1277251200,8,5672,4.902083333333334
3819871,5,B001V7UTP2,"A very good overall story of the blade, its mystique, and rightful place in history. There are some excellent sequences and anecdotes from actors who have used the sword in movies and those that train them and the relative differences between what we have all seen in the movies and how the Western swords were actually used in combat. The Follow on disc with all of the extras and the entire section on modern Sword fighting styles, associations, and excerpts from their training courses was outstanding!",1275091200,2,505,4.883720930232558
3819872,2,B001V7UTP2,"For a third-generation foilsman this sounded like a wonderful program - especially since it was narrated by the impressive John Rhys-Davies.  Unfortunately, this documentary exposes an ugly feud among sword-enthusiasts.  For years there have been taunts and sneers made by Medieval or Renaissance re-enactors against competitive fencers - usually of the ""That's not REAL fencing"" variety.  This documentary celebrates a subset of the latter who call themselves ""historical swordsmen.""  The narration belittles what it calls ""sport fencing,"" illustrating it as an aberrant twig on the tree of fencing tradition, and using competitive fencers' self-deprecating comments for support. The self-styled ""historians"" put down the ""impractical,"" ""rules-driven,"" ""pared-down"" nature of modern foil/epee/sabre fencing.

While the interest that these ""historians"" have in ancient fencing texts is laudable, their blindness and prejudices are not.  There are verities about fencing that can't be understood unless one competes against an opponent; for example, parries and other movements are necessarily ""pared down,"" since wasting a fraction of a second leads to getting hit.  Secondly, they assume that ""real"" fencing involves broadswords, and give short-shrift to lighter weapons, such as rapiers.  Third, they don't need to ""reclaim"" anything, since competitive fencers have always been well-aware of the literary tradition of old fencing manuals.  I find it suspicious that these ""historians"" can't even employ the rich vocabulary of fencing terminology - at least not in this program.  The pejorative remarks made in this program against modern fencing's emphasis on thrusting with the point shows a shocking ignorance of the evolution of fencing theory - found in aging texts - over the past three-hundred years in this direction.  Modern foil progressed organically from training practices involving the very lethal smallsword - a weapon that isn't mentioned at all in this program.  Whether the Johnny-come-lately's like it or not, modern fencing is the inheritor of an unbroken line of fencing tradition.

Though the emphasis in this program is on the ""martial art of Western swordfighting,"" it takes a few minutes to decry Kendo almost as nastily as it put down competitive fencing.  Due to the expertise of the man interviewed, a Korean swordfighting technique gets better treatment.

In this mix of bad and good elements, legendary Hollywood fencing choreographer Bob Anderson is interviewed.  It's almost worthwhile to tolerate the taunts in the other parts of the program in order to hear him.  This program also devotes a great deal of time showing the design and production of heavy swords for Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  Perhaps it's not coincidental that the narrator was one of the stars of those films, and that two of the main interviewees were also ""Rings"" stars.

By the way, like my fencing forefathers, I've been challenged at times by ""reenactors"" and other cynics to demonstrate the validity of modern fencing techniques against them.  I've let them set the parameters of the challenge (usually placing the combat ""in the round""), and have never failed to place my point on target at will.  The producers of this film would be advised to do as well.",1269648000,9,3282,5.408644400785855
3819873,4,B001V7UTP2,"The two disc edition of ""Reclaiming the blade"" expands on the original doccumentary by adding several hours worth of materials that, for one reason or other, did not made it into the movie itself or can be seen a supplementary material - videos of historical swordfighting techniques, additional material about Veta studios and such. Movie itself is a very good source of information for people who only have encountered swords in feature films and literature, as it dispells many myths that exist in our society regarding this ""nobliest of weapons"". Presented by famous movie stars and scientitsts, as well as enthusiasts recreating historical European martial arts, the storry is enticing and well presented.

3819894,5,B001V7UTP2,"This video highlights attempts to rediscover western martial arts of the sword. The production takes on a difficult task that, for me, was successful. I found this video to be well made, informative and entertaining. It is narrated by John Rhys-Davies and maintained a good pace as well as making subjects that could be a little boring seem very interesting.

The video begins by highlighting the symbolism of the sword even in modern times, its continued use in film and entertainment. It moves swiftly to the story of the disappearance of the sword as a weapon on the battlefield and how the western way of the sword devolved into the sport of fencing.

The video then moves to efforts in the last few decades to rediscover the western martial art of the sword by various groups, from medieval re-enactors to serious students of martial arts studying period manuals who attempted to work out how men fought with edged weapons hundreds of years ago.

I thought this was a very good video for those interested in both the sword and western martial arts. It is a well-produced documentary with an excellent narrator. The finished product is something that is both informative and entertaining. Definitely worth the asking price for the those interested in military history, weapons or martial arts.

3819895,3,B001V7UTP2,"Reclaiming the Blade is a mixed bag of a documentary with a lot of potential that doesn't quite come together. I kept on getting the feeling that there were several documentaries that were partially filmed and jammed together.  My girlfriend (a foil fencer) made the observation that the film seemed like the introductory episode to a series on the topic.  If reclaiming the blade could be expanded into a multi-episode documentary it could be terrific with time to explore various topics like sport fencing, the multitude of different western sword styles, theatrical swordsmanship, eastern martial arts in the west, design & construction of swords etc. in depth.

The documentary that we got covers all of those, and more, but with odd fits and starts of depth.  The chronology jumps around a bit. The movie is ostensibly about the rediscovery and re-emergence of western medieval / Renaissance swordsmanship.  That is the movie's stated purpose, but only something like a third of this 78 minute movie deals with that. There is little discussion about the actual masters who wrote this stuff down, and only a few names are dropped.

One major problem can be seen on the cover.  The scored interviews with Viggo Mortensen, Karl Urban, Richard Taylor & his WETA team.  This takes huge chunks of film time to talk about Hollywood sword fights and nice but very long AFI style montage of sword fights. Instead of being a nice minute or two about how Hollywood's influence on the views of swordsmanship, it becomes the savior of swordsmanship.  (Not even a bone to literature? Or Prince Valiant?  Or D&D?) Now there is a gem here.  They scored an interview with Bob Anderson.  He is the living legend of film swordsmanship.  And this is the shame, he could have been the basis of a terrific documentary in of itself.

Second DVD.  The WETA stuff is just promo.  The instructional videos are mixed. They seem to be sent in from the sword groups and are of varying quality.  By far the best is the silent video of medieval wrestling techniques by a Polish group.  They are highly professional and it can be used on its own for instructional purposes, too bad no interviews made it to the main video. The Lightsaber troupe video, well we'll not say much more.

One last critique. I can understand how the filmmaker got confused, but the SCA is not reenactment.  The SCA is based on a creative historical like world, reenactment is about getting as close as possible to the actual historical past.

So what's the final word.  If you swing swords for fun, sure pick it up, it can be one of those things to watch with you relatives that don't get it.  There are lots of nice pieces in the movie, but you might feel like you're wading around though unnecessary CGI or detours to get to them. Maybe best to get if you think this is a movie that you'll trade around with your friends.",1262736000,12,2873,4.69061876247505
3819896,1,B001V7UTP2,"Let me begin by saying that I really wanted to like this video. It has a few good points, hence the one star (instead of 0). It has been heralded as a big budget documentary on WMA, and this is very misleading, in my opinion. Firstly, why is a Kumdo practioner given so much screen time? Its frankly stupid. As if korean kendo has anything to do with wma. This insult is continued on the second disc, where we are given further instruction in kumdo. Why? Don't use the feeble excuse that its there to demonstrate some sort of relation between east and west. thats bull. we are also treated to some pathetic SCA dopes making fools of themselves, and some really out of shape weirdo pretending to be an authority on swordfighting, as he has his ""students"" climb up and down a stepladder while wearing armor. All in all its really boring, it has bland graphics, and doesnt really impart any useful information to any but the most clueless of watchers. A major portion of the movie is given to explaining how popular the sword is in film, complete with clip after clip of swordplay in movies, including star wars. whatever. Th few high points come from the few historians interviewed, John Clements, and some of the interviews with a few of the practicioners.

3819897,4,B001V7UTP2,"There was a time when the sword was an important military object. In today's world the sword has no military use whatsoever. Yet it has a enjoyed a revival of symbolic and meaningful power and strength. Nobody can deny the allure the sword has on the modern world. This documentary style work takes a look at that very concept.

It is a documentary of sorts that describes the history of the sword and also delves deeply into the lasting impression that the sword has on us even to this day when swords are pretty much not of any military use. It is undeniable that the sword holds a place of symbolic power, strength and reverance in today's world. And this film explores this theme.

There are lots of great tie ins to modern film,  and how the sword is still very much used in film, from star wars to period movies like Kingdom of Heaven. There is also lots of footage from these movies and an explanation of how the sword is portrayed and used in these movies.  There are also a lot of great interviews with archaeologists, film makers, sword makers and even actors including Viggo Mortensen from Lord of the Rings.

Another interesting aspect that is covered in the documentary is the difference between European swords/martial arts and the Eastern swords and martial arts.

Here are a few tasty snippets from the film:

And, there is lots of stuff about the modern practice and art of sword fighting through sub cultures like the Society of Creative Anachronism, and the HACA (The Historical Armed Combat Association). All in all, if you are a fan of swords then this is a must watch. You are going to be pleased and amazed.",1258848000,2,2856,6.397402597402597
3819898,2,B001V7UTP2,"This is like a history channel documentary, with deep narration trying for ""reclaiming"" drama.  Some of it was interesting and I liked seeing all the different researchers and re-creators playing with swords, which they were very insistent on calling 'European Martial Arts' -- I guess in contrast to Asian martial arts. I try to avoid cultural stereotypes in any case.

But my husband pointed out that in saying that The Blade was lost, they totally ignored all the cavalry sabers and rifle bayonets.  I was also a bit miffed that this documentary didn't give enough credit to the SCA people who did a ton of original source research back in the early 1970s.

The extended edition might be better, or it might just be longer, I can't tell.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reclaiming-the-Blade-2-disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001YZ1RUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reclaiming the Blade (2-disc Special Edition)</a>",1257033600,4,950,5.963235294117647

If you can, get the two-disk set, since in the second disk you may find samples of instruction in some of the resurrected western martial arts.

In bringing back the study of this part of our heritage and giving it the respect that it deserves, we also enrich our own culture today.",1255305600,,452,4.5
3819900,3,B001V7UTP2,"Kinda cool, kinda interesting, kinda disappointing, but with some very cool moments, Reclaiming the Blade is a mixed bag. I don't regret buying it but it's not a favourite. being a historical re-enactor for fun, just getting into historical manual combat, the highlights were some very cool snippets of show combat, and manual combat, by various groups. If you sift through the fluff there are some good moments, and it's not rubbish by any means, but it's the frustrating sort of project where someone has a great idea, but doesn't do the sort of in-depth job you wished they could have done.",1255219200,,593,4.823529411764706

3819903,4,B001V7UTP2,This was a very good documentary. I have no real complaints except they could have gone even deeper into the subject matter. Worth purchasing - just be sure to purchase Spec Ed.,1253664000,,177,4.5625

Too long the mythology of the superiority of the Samurai blade and blade maker has been accepted as established fact, when to the contrary, the sword makers around the world were all equally skilled.  Solingen swords from Germany, Toledo swords from Spain, Damascus swords from the Middle East, Ulfbehrt swords from Northern Europe...all regions developed the means of crafting blades of superior quality.

Good to see this finally recognized as well as the fighting skills of the combatants.  Western martial arts have been long neglected.  This documentary gives a great introduction to the subject.",1520121600,,735,5.194915254237288
