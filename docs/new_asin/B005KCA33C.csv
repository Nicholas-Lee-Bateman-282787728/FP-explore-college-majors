8476717,4,B005KCA33C,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and NWA with this show celebrating their 8 year anniversary.

The main event was originally scheduled to be a triple threat match as P.W.G. Champion Claudio Castagnoli vs. Chris Hero vs. Eddie Edwards but with Eddie having a staff infection, it became a singles match with both men having fun checking out the top rope based off their match from ""All Star Weekend 8"" before having a technical match that started off slow but picked up over time but it was the aftermath of the match that changed the direction of the promotion.  Kevin Steen once again pulled double duty here as he had a singles match against Pac that had Steen's usual humor before the match while Pac pulled off some amazing aerial moves that earned him his nickname ""The Man Gravity Forgot"" causing Steen to take to the air himself with moves like a moonsault...then Steen returned later teaming with CIMA against the Young Bucks who were fresh off their release from TNA (and had plenty to say about it) in a very hard fought match with Steen being more serious than he usually is.  Other matches include The Dynasty (Joey Ryan & Scorpio Sky) against the RockNES Monsters in a match spent as much time outside the ring as they did inside, El Generico & Ricochet against Generation Next's Alex Shelley & Roderick Strong, Peter Avalon vs. Ryan Taylor that you will love if your a Booker T fan, and Brian Cage-Taylor vs. Brandon Gatson.

This was the strong show that you usually expect from P.W.G. with the only downfall being the Cage-Taylor vs. Brandon Gatson match falling flat & killing the crowd but past that, you can't go wrong.",1333756800,,1881,4.7784615384615385
