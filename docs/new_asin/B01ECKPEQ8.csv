8758340,5,B01ECKPEQ8,"If you like tropical music and try to get concert videos, you'll quickly realize that there's not a lot out there. And when you find one, production quality is usually poor, e.g. Willy Chirino's 35-year concert DVD or Ruben Blades' Todos Vuelven DVD. Even Juan Luis Guerra's DVD suffers from awful directing --although his music is probably the best there is in its genre.
This Blu-ray is the exception. Production quality is incredibly high, both in audio and video quality, and musicians and direction are also of the very highest quality. It can easily be used as a reference Blu-ray to test high-end home audio equipment. It is that good.
Omar Alfanno is not the greatest singer, but he is arguably the most prolific/successful salsa composer of the last few decades. His singing is not awful, either, it's just not on par with that of the singers who made his many hits so famous. That doesn't take away from how pleasant this concert is.
I'd give this Blu-ray a 9.5/10. Superb music.
It is a little pricier than usual but I think it's totally worth it.
If you like tropical, or even if you just like music, try this one out. You won't regret it.",1487289600,,1151,4.619512195121951
