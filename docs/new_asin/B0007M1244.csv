This is the story based on a true legend hero who used to be a humble and loyal subject but eventually rose to fight against corruptive local feudal lord and suppressive warlord goverment, sacrificing everything including his title rank, his family and his own life for his people's grassland and right to live on it.

Great battle scene, touching music, beautiful grassland, and heart-broken story .  May not be refined as ""Braveheart"", but even more impressive!

After William Wallace failed, his land is still green; but after Gada Melin failed, his land becomes desert nowadays ...... Not only a revolutionist for his people but also a environmentalist for all mankind.

I have watched this movie for quite a few times, and glad to buy this DVD to keep it in my collection of classic epic movies along with ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"".",1356652800,,954,4.900621118012422

It features a musician and singer who is a hero in the country and he plays the two-string lute that is larger than similar instruments used all over Asia and by far the most emotional and spiritual. The story is an important one for the world to know, about how the Japanese exploited the country in the 30s and 40s with the help of the ruling elite and how those like Gada fought back. Do not miss this. And not just for the music.",1261008000,,580,4.37962962962963
