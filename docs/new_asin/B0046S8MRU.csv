4271022,5,B0046S8MRU,"Yes, I have to agree with the before-poster -

it is a much better rate to release each half-a-season every two months!

We won't get them to release full seasons like the first, so let's stay happy,
IF they carry on with this releasing rate!
16 more seasons to go...with this rate it would take 64 months for all twenty seasons...
only five/six years...this would be acceptable, especially for the long-time fans.

I've been knowing Gunsmoke only for about 4 months now, been a western-fan (Bonanza, John Wayne etc)
all my 30-year-young life - but I never experienced such a great atmosphered show like Gunsmoke.

Never watched one of the later episodes for I wanna start with the early ones...
...so I am excited what is about to come when sometime Chester will leave and Festus is about
to join the crew (whom I don't know yet...)

Here in good old Germany the Gunsmoke DVDs can only be purchased from the US, so it takes me a little waiting each time I order a DVD but it's worth the waiting.

I am really happy that this great actor and friend of John Wayne's
James Arness is still with us in good health. Recently I been visiting his website,
where a statement says he still reads his email fanpost, sure he hardly replies a one at 88,
but I think - why not writing him some nice lines as long he's still with us...
one of the great actors of the 20th century!!!

Keep Gunsmoke alive...(and keep up those releasing rates, please!!!! ;-)

4271023,5,B0046S8MRU,"Now that's the way Gunsmoke releases should be, one every 2 months! Split sesaons or not, I am happy to see 4 of 20 seasons soon to be in my collection. I just hope & pray that CBS Paramount will get on Gunsmoke Season 5 early in 2011 so I can live long enough to have all 20 seasons in my collection.
Thanks from a BIG Gunsmoke fan.",1286841600,44,333,3.911764705882353

4271029,5,B0046S8MRU,"This is an American institution, the best western television show and one the top shows ever produced.
By the fourth season, everything is settling with the writing and acting complementing each other producing the top show for the second year in a row.  The second year of a four-year run as the top television show, 1957 to 1961.
James Arness, Dennis Weaver and Amanda Blake are nominated and this season is nominated for best western.
Some of the notable shows in this set are:
Letter of the Law, where Matt gets trapped between the law and humanity.
The Cast, where a man who hates doctors menaces Doc.
Young Love, Kittys Rebellion and Marshal Proudfoot are just fun.
There was a horse looks at the gunfighter mentality of the era.

The two volumes contain all 39 episodes, the first 19 in volume one and the balance in two.  Special features are sponsor spots for the new electric shavers and cigarettes.
This review covers both volumes, as I see no point in buying half the season.  I always buy both and strongly suggest you do the same.",1474675200,,1044,4.627027027027027

4271032,5,B0046S8MRU,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

4271055,5,B0046S8MRU,"Gunsmoke is a great series. The problem is with the case. The plastic thing that holds the dvds arrived broken, so my dvds are loose in the case. The part that is broken is the bottom piece that holds the three dvds in the binding of the case. It's not that big of a deal I guess, but I am paying for it. Can't I have it intact? It won't keep me from purchasing Gunsmoke. Could they possibly put it in a cardboard container and this would be less likely to occur? The manilla envelope looked like it had some kind of tire tracks on it. I give the shipping a 1 out of 5. disappointed",1431043200,2,582,4.025862068965517

Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference.
