8338659,2,B001RR35IE,"As stated in other reviews, the word ""remastered"" is very misleading! The quality of film is terrible. None of the DVDs have  been properly transferred, hence the film clarity is lacking.

Love the film, but wish a clean and vivid version would come out on DVD.

This is not one!",1337990400,,279,4.54
8338660,2,B001RR35IE,"I would like to see this film properly. However, this dvd picture quality is AWFUL, practically unwatchable. I did watch it, but it stretched my patience.",1322352000,2,154,4.961538461538462
8338661,1,B001RR35IE,"This was actually SWORD OF LANCELOT renamed on the case but not on the film itself.  I won't dwell on the movie which is awesome - I already have it on VHS.  Since this was advertised as ""Remastered"" I expected a top quality print.  That was a mistaken expectation. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. This is without a doubt the worst transfer I have ever seen of any movie.  It looks like a third generation VHS (fullscreen) copy.  I made a copy from my VHS tape after watching this garbage - and mine was superior by about ten to one.  Don't waste your money on this [...]!  It did seem to be in widescreen although it didn't say so in the ad.
