7927168,5,B00004YA1O,"Bloody Duel plays like a live action version of the classic anime Fist of the Northstar, as the local kung fu masters get holes punched in them by the vicious Japanese fighters played with gleeful abandon by Alan Tang (Flaming Brothers), Eddie Ko (The Mission Avenging Eagle), and Chen Kuan Tai (Heroes Two, Iron Monkey). With their master dead and no one to turn to, the remaining young fighters must look outside their own tradition for a way to claim vengeance. Putting the old rules aside they form a fighting force consisting of a Thai boxer, drunken kung fu bandit, an acrobat and the Master's former prized students.

When these rag tag fighters strike back they enter into a blood-soaked all day battle royale against the entire Japanese fighting force. Bloody Duel: Life & Death is non stop action in the Old School tradition.",1348617600,,835,4.798611111111111
7927169,1,B00004YA1O,"I knew going in that purchasing a Crash Master film would be a risk their films are real old school with bad choragraphy, the only reason I brought this item is because I'am a big Chen Kuan Tai fan. Well all of my assumptions were right this film is bad hard to even sit through.",1237939200,,279,4.090909090909091
7927170,3,B00004YA1O,"To me this movie makes me laugh because of the cheesy moves the characters do. I think half of the actors in this film didn't really know Kung Fu; this is probably why theirs so many camera cuts of the fighters flying back and forth, also flipping in the air. Yes there are bloody scenes in the movie and that's one of the things that make this old school flick OK! A Japanese Master goes around killing Chinese Kung Fu masters claiming He's the best until he meets his match. Like I said, it's funny to me with all the jumping & blood. This is a good, clear copy of this move with a widescreen transfer.",1017014400,,604,4.2155172413793105
