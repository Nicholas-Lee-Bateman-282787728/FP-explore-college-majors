For all the marketing hype online, it's actually a pretty poor film. The bike build should have been able to tie everything together but it just doesn't flow.",1470009600,,318,4.696428571428571

2489896,5,B000E4FHTQ,The bikes they build are second to none coming from a second hand point of view....Jason Jesse appearance makes it that much more entertaining,1445472000,,142,4.958333333333333
2489897,4,B000E4FHTQ,I really enjoyed this movie as a whole. It's not action packed more about the friendships and process of building chopper. I especially liked the bike they created in the end. The only part I didn't care for was the guy who thy bought tank from felt he was weird but that's my opinion. Peek into guy culture.,1444694400,2,308,4.327586206896552
2489898,3,B000E4FHTQ,Movie is all over the place. it's literally just a video of a bunch of guys working on choppers. Wasn't a bad movie but then again wasn't a good movie.,1441756800,,151,4.066666666666666

2489918,2,B000E4FHTQ,"Don't buy the hype, it's a pretty weak documentary. Good topic but lacks style and flow.  I'm betting all of the 5 star reviews are club members voting it up.

Harbortown Bobber was better because it focused on the build, rather than filling the movie with irrelevant haircut and concert scenes.",1424822400,,295,4.764705882352941

2489935,5,B000E4FHTQ,This movie tells such a great story.  Zack and Scott did an awesome job making this movie about a group of righteous guys coming together to build an amazing chopper.  The soundtrack featuring James Intveld is perfect for the film as well.,1390953600,2,239,4.666666666666667

2489938,5,B000E4FHTQ,I grew up in the hot rod car scene. It is nice to see it so accurately depicted.  Unlike Hollywood b.s. that never gets any non mainstream culture right.,1366502400,,153,4.275862068965517
2489939,3,B000E4FHTQ,"This kept me interested however the whole ""brotherhood"" theme is just not for me. Love bikes my self and think what they did with the bike in the movie was awesome but the ""lifestyle"" could have been presented a little better than just a bunch of guys who bow down to ""Rico"".",1366156800,,275,4.3076923076923075
2489940,3,B000E4FHTQ,"I love the construction of the bike and the passion for the brotherhood, but some of these guys are downright moronic.  IF they hugged and kissed or styled each others hair anymore, i would have started to fast forward...  maybe i am just a little too old.",1362787200,,256,4.425531914893617

2489943,1,B000E4FHTQ,"Slow moving, not that interesting.

Very fragmented in the storyline, and characters.  Has no flow.
Seems like random shots and scenes, to fill an hour or so of tape.

Take the $20 and go to a local bike night.

Not worth the money to buy this movie.",1345248000,3,250,4.25531914893617

2489945,5,B000E4FHTQ,"This film is badass!!! I wrench on bikes for a living, so it really hit home for me. You'd be hard pressed to find another film as real as this one. These guys have their nuts and bolts in a row! It's got style to burn!! I thoroughly recommend the follow up 'From The Vault' as well! If you love riding and wrenching on bikes do yourself a favor and watch this flick!!!",1340323200,2,369,4.068493150684931
2489946,4,B000E4FHTQ,"This movie was a nice change of pace from all the ""Pop"" motorcycle tv shows. No amazing over the top theme bikes here. No nikes that are so ridiculous they aren't motorcycles anymore. Just down and dirty bikes , built by the hands of the guys who are going to ride them. This is what the motorcyle culture is really about to me. Riding what you can scrounge up and build yourself. No payments to make every month for a shiny new bike like every other guy has. These guys truly own there bikes. I enjoyed the movie very much. Don't expect the usual pace of a Hollywood movie. It's much more laid back and slow paced. It's like you were invited to hang out with these guys in the garage as they build this bike. Get a six pack and watch it. Will you be able to build one yourself after you watch it? NO. This is not instructional, it's just cool. My wife actually watched the whole thing with me. I thought she would get bored and leave , but she didn't. (the only downside)",1339372800,10,972,4.2032085561497325
2489947,2,B000E4FHTQ,"It was more about man love than bikes. Took a wrong turn into weirdsville. Didn't pay money to watch some guy kiss his barber. Complete mess right there. If I wanted to watch that crap i'd pay for cable. The scences about the bikes, where they are talking about the bikes were great. The scenes of man love were less than entertaining. I cannot see myself buying another one of their videos. It's very apperant the best scenes are on you tube.",1335052800,4,443,4.414634146341464
2489948,5,B000E4FHTQ,"cool documentary about club life...
I'm a lone wolf, but would have loved to be apart of a brotherhood like that.
great inside to the lifestyle.",1333843200,,144,4.576923076923077
2489949,5,B000E4FHTQ,"Bikers are starved for great biker movies, and this is the best one to come out in quite awhile.  After I watched the movie, I felt like I knew these guys and I was a Sinner.  However, reality soon sets in and then you realize you aren't.  Regardless, these are the types of friends every man should have, and this is these are the types of men that every man should also strive to be.  Brotherhood is at an all-time low these days, so take notes guys.  Gets your test-i-cles back, and realize that your brothers are really the only people you can count on.",1324857600,2,557,4.266666666666667
2489950,5,B000E4FHTQ,"id read about this movie a couple of times.  always thought it would be something i was interested in as im into hot rod cars and motorcycles and all that stuff.  i read about on some blog or website the other night and somehow, im not even sure how, ended up on amazons video section.  heck, i didn't even know amazon had a video section.  i typed in choppertown and sure enough, there it was.  i think it was $2.99 or something.  what the heck...i ordered it.  couple minutes later, and there i am watching choppertown.  very cool.

the movie itself was really cool.  its kind a day in the life or couple days in the life of a car / motorcycle club:  the sinners.  theres some cool bikes and hot rods in it, and its just cool seeing these guys shops, cars and a peek into their lives.

the video playback was good.  it wasn't perfect, there was a little 'glitch' that locked up the playback for about 2 min. or so in the middle of the movie, but that wasn't that big of a deal.  i think for the couple bucks it cost i had it for 2 or 3 days also, so if i wanted to i couldve watched it again.

all in all, the movie was very good as was the amazon video playback.  theres another choppertown movie im going to get next, and i won't hesitate to watch it or anything else that looks good on amazon.",1310169600,5,1298,4.087301587301587
2489961,2,B000E4FHTQ,Overall the documentary was ok but did lack a certain something that kept you glued to your chair. I would not be in hurry to watch it again.,1306195200,,141,4.071428571428571
2489962,5,B000E4FHTQ,"My hat is off to the Choppertown people. This documentary is incredible. I watch it probably twice a month without hesitation and even more when its raining and I cant go ride. The video follows around the The Sinners MC, who are the epitome of biker cool. You get to watch them interact, ride, and build some of the coolest hand made motorcycles you've ever seen. You also get to see the enigmatic Jason Jessee and all his lunatic splendor as he rides and works with his Sinners brothers. Which is always a plus. In short this video really captures the essence and the very definition of ""biker brotherhood"". If you are thinking about buying this dvd, don't think...pull the trigger. You won't regret it.

Also, for those of you who don't get it.....you never will.",1303862400,3,766,4.632352941176471
2489963,5,B000E4FHTQ,"Really enjoyed this inside look into the Sinners bike/car culture.  These guys seem really tight and the camaraderie is fun to watch.  The entire process of building a bike from the ground up on the cheap with mostly used parts and free labor is fascinating.  The great soundtrack really compliments the movie too.  The scenes with the guys just talking and even getting a hair cut are really the highlight of this documentary because you really start to understand the meaning of brotherhood.  The one thing that surprised me is that most of the riding scenes are on the interstate, which I personally try to avoid if at all possible.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1296345600,4,665,4.739130434782608
2489964,5,B000E4FHTQ,"This is a great documentary about everyday people that love to build bikes and hang out with their friends.
Quite a few famous people too including Cole Foster (salinas) and Jason Jessee (pro skater, pro madman).
Good fab stuff aswell. Cole and thomas relocating the gas filler on the tank is very interesting.
Just a good movie about normal guys just doing what they love.",1274659200,4,373,4.753846153846154

really good and 5 stars good!!! ride on people...",1227657600,,337,4.349206349206349
2489966,4,B000E4FHTQ,"It's a documentaire, not a movie! But the way The Sinners are shown was very interesting. A bunch of people who are no sissies, but not a 'gang' in the way people think about bikers. It was a pleasure to watch and I can recommend it!",1209254400,,233,4.086956521739131
2489967,5,B000E4FHTQ,One of the best motorcycle DVDs I've seen in years!  Shows the life that most of us would love to live.  I definitely recommend this DVD to any biker.,1172102400,,150,4.137931034482759
2489968,5,B000E4FHTQ,"When I started to watch this movie, I really was not sure what to expect. I thought that maybe this movie was going to be just another show about putting expensive bikes together. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't anything like that. This movie caught my attention for it was about real people, living real lives, who enjoy building and riding motorcycles. Being a motorcycle rider myself, I can relate to the passion these guys have. I can see it in their actions and over all philosophy of how they live their lives. This movie does a great job bringing this out as well the loyalty these guys have to their friends. This is something that is real, not fake, and should be watched by anyone who rides.",1164585600,,711,4.51937984496124
2489969,5,B000E4FHTQ,"i really liked this movie because it turns conventional documentary structure on its head and really gives the impression of riding along with this fascinating group of people.  it felt like one of alex cox's movies ""straight to hell"" or ""sid and nancy"" because of the cool organic way the music was mixed in.  a great indie effort.",1164412800,,332,4.706896551724138
2489970,5,B000E4FHTQ,"I love this movie.  There are so many things good to say about it, but perhaps the best thing about this is that they nailed what bikes are about.  It is about brotherhood, hanging with your bros, loyalty....  The bikes are amazing, but you don't have to like bikes to identify with the movie.
