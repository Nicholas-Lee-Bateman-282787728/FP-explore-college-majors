8225913,3,B000WW1YN8,"I received the product in a timely manner. The box with illustrations holding the DVD had a rip about a half-inch wide. As I collect these for the nice box with the art work I was a bit unhappy with its condition. Although, Im not sure if I can blame amazon for that.",1202428800,,267,4.056603773584905
8225914,4,B000WW1YN8,"The review for The Prince of Tennis Vol. 4 is pretty much the same as Vol. 3...the second season Japanese open/end are still missing and replaced with first season's. Ironically, intrumental U.S. opening was adapted to include episode scenes in episode 48, just like the Japanese...would have been nice to be able to see it with the original ""Driving Myself"" when watching the Japanese version on the DVD though. Same trailers since Vol. 2 also. And the DVD ends with episode 50, which just so happens to be the last episode shown on Toonami Jetstream before it was yanked off this week (1/14/07 exactly, the day before the DVD release)...which makes one wonder if the show is still being dubbed, or if not, will The Prince of Tennis continue to be released on DVD in only Japanese (which would be great if they just picked up where they left off), but I would hate to have to buy the first 50 episode over again to get the rest...",1200441600,8,931,4.5476190476190474
