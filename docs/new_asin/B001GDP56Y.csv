To prepare for the interview the Mrs. and I watched some of the movies Fred had been in.  We discovered this movie and loved it.  It is an odd combo of serious crime film and slapstick comedy.
Think Law and order SVU starring Charlie Chaplin.",1470268800,,361,4.4393939393939394
8305070,4,B001GDP56Y,"This is an enjoyable some what  dark comedy , although not particularly dark. If your a fan of Fred Ewanuick  ( Hank - Corner Gas or  Dan - Dan for mayor ) your sure to enjoy this comedy, who else could get finger prints from the wool on a sheep? His character is less like Hank than the hapless Dan. The comedy is good,  only over the top a couple of times. Great supporting cast, worth viewing.",1341964800,,396,4.103896103896104
8305071,3,B001GDP56Y,"I bought a house in British Columbia and it had so many absolutely goofy repairs and remodeling that I'd tell people that I thought the carpenter must have been someone too stupid to stay in Newfoundland.  Whether rightfully or not, many Canadians view Newfoundlanders as the stupidest class of people in Canada.  You have to understand this to appreciate this movie.

In a nutshell, here is what the story is about (from: [...] 'Newfoundland ranger Andrew Hepditch (Fred Ewaniuk) is sent out to the isolated outport of Swyer?s Harbour to investigate a sheep mutilation. But young Hepditch is not prepared for what awaits him in Swyers Harbour, and he is in way over his head as he finds himself face and eyes in the middle of a vicious murder. He desperately tries to navigate the mysterious workings of outport life.

From the time young Triffie's dead body washes ashore, everything is turned upside down in the quiet life of the locals. Of course, all of them seem perfectly respectable at first glance, but young Hepditch, as he goes further into his investigation, discovers many mysteries, intrigues and secrets.'

I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but it isn't bad either.  Both my wife and I got quite a few laughs from it.",1228608000,5,1236,4.779342723004695
