8258594,5,B0015I2SHY,"""Pope John Paul II: A Saint of Our Time,"" by producer and director John Biffar is an exceptional and faithful portrayal of John Paul the Great - his life, his influences and his influence on ending the cold war. While this documentary was made at the time he was being beatified by the Vatican, the film is timeless and is worth having in one's personal library.

Biffer tells John Paul's story with reverence...with an emphasis on John Paul's connection to people everywhere, his concern with totalitarianism, and his influence as an advocate of freedom and human rights. He draws on the experiences and insights of former ABC Vatican correspondent Bill Blakemore, Vatican-based clergy Fr.  Benjamin Cieply, LC, Monsignor Mauro Cozzoli, and Archbishop Patrick Foley,  prominent Jewish Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, and several others to outline John Paul's place in history and his most human side. I was particularly impressed with the discussion of his prayer life and how he would be oblivious to all around him as he prayed, ""He was in conversation with God.""

Biffer and his editor Dave Beaty do a masterful job in telling the story, drawing video footage from ABC,  ITN, Centro Televisio Vaticano, the National Archives, and the Vatican Photo Service.

My family had an opportunity to shake hands with John Paul II in January, 1992, in a private Vatican Chapel where he prayed the rosary on the first Saturday of each month. He was, in person, all that he was said to be, a man with a twinkle in his eye, and compassion for all in his heart.",1347235200,2,1541,4.840304182509506

8258596,5,B0015I2SHY,"Great documentary, especially as a supplement for ""Witness to Hope"". And that's exactly what I was looking for. Those 2 documentaries perfectly complete each other, telling the full story. While ""Witness to Hope"" shows a broad historical and political picture and the role of JP II and Poland in destroying communism in Europe, ""A Saint for Our Times"" tells more closely about the pope himself. I really recommend having / watching both these films. I've just ordered the latest documentary about the pope - ""Nine Days that Changed the World"" (on different website) and can't wait to watch that one; its preview looks just great!",1275004800,4,629,5.0
8258597,5,B0015I2SHY,"I have 2 DVDs on the life of Pope John Paul II i.e., this DVD and ""John Paul the Great: A Pope Who Made History"". Both of these DVDs are a must have for Pope John Paul II admirers. In the history of England, only one King was ever called ""The Great"". He was Alfred the great. And yet we now have Pope John Paul the Great. And in the history of the church, only one Pope was ever demanded to become a saint immediately after his death (Santo Subito). He was Pope John Paul II. Indeed, Pope John Paul II broke grounds in many ways. He was the first Slav to be elected Pope. With Joseph Ratzinger, he pondered how to reclaim the initial vision of Vatican II and to restore the Church's former glory through a renewal of her historic beliefs creatively expressed to a rapidly changing world. Pope John Paul II's appointment was to change the world, and strike fear in the hearts of the communist despots that ruled his native land. It would be the Holy Father's return to his homeland in 1979 that set in motion the tumultuous events that would lead to the collapse of the Iron Curtain countries. It is one of the strange dichotomies of Pope John Paul II that he was so popular when he was also so entrenched in his views. He was so beloved by millions of people within and outside the Catholic religion. During his 27 years papacy, he would change the image of papacy forever, with a mass appeal never before seen in the history of the Church. He was nicknamed ""John Paul Superstar"". Time magazine named him ""Man of the Year"" in 1994. Watch this movie and it will make your day.",1232928000,12,1575,4.324324324324325
