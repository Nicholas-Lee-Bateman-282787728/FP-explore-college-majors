8727525,4,B013FDBGZ6,"Great price for complete set of Shelldon. It contains CGI animation and is set near a tropical shoreline, both underwater and occasionally above water. The stories are partially educational, with a moral of the story segment at the end of every episode.

For the package.. all DVD stack together which have to be carefully putting in or getting the disc out",1456876800,,357,4.852459016393443
