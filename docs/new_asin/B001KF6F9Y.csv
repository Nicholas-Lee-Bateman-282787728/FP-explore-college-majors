8314920,5,B001KF6F9Y,"I saw a clip of Merlin's aria ""Hail Mystic Morn"" on local ARTS tv and immediately bough the full DVD.  I haven't watched the full opera yet, but would have bought it for this one aria alone.  Wilson-Johnson's singing and presentation are perfect for the part, ranging from profound gravity at the beginning of the aria to exuberant triumphalism at the end of it.  Interplay of costume and lighting is extraordinary, which is only partially represented on the cover.",1518912000,,465,4.860759493670886
8314921,4,B001KF6F9Y,"I was very interested and intrigued when I saw this recording. First of all, the story behind the opera was very interesting, and I was excited by the fact that it was a world premiere. Also, the facts that it was in English and that it was a familiar story further interested me. As soon as it came in the mail, I popped it into the DVD player. The music was amazing (very powerful and Wagnerian). Although Eva Marton is kind of annoying, the opera as a whole is fantastic and visually spectacular. David Wilson-Johnson as Merlin was amazing. He has a great, very powerful voice. Overall, this is a wonderful recording to add to your collection.",1444694400,3,646,4.52991452991453
8314922,5,B001KF6F9Y,Well done photography of this opera. The other reviews of this opera are correct about Eva Marton - she probably should retire. But this is the only DVD of this opera.,1367020800,,167,4.419354838709677
