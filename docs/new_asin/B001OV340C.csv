These Sherlock Holmes movies feature Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John H. Watson. Bruce has a passing resemblance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but often seems slower witted than in the original stories. Yes, this explains things to the audience.

The first two Sherlock Holmes movies are set in the late 19th century, the next twelve movies are set in modern times (the 1940's). Many fans of the stories prefer the older settings even if this culture is unknown to them (horses, no central heating). The copyrights expired in 1970 so people are free to use these characters in new stories. Few are as good as the original, even if meant as a parody. Doyle was a student of criminology, many of the stories were based on actual crimes. The Valley of Fear is a good example. Here are the names of the movies and their original dates. See the individual reviews for more details.
