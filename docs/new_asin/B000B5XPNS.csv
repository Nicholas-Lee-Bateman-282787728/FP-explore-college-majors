8081941,3,B000B5XPNS,"Some of the video segments were not that great because they didn't explain nearly enough, or they rushed by the most important parts that people would likely have quetsions on.  But half the video segments were pretty good.  I especially liked the segment about switches & sockets, where they switched out several switches and sockets.  They recommended putting ground fault interrupters (GFI's) on all outlets in the kitchen and bathroom for safety, which was good. I also liked the segment about repairing fluorescent light fixtures. I wasn't impressed with the segment about range hood removal and replacement, since were going way too fast and didn't provide much useful information. The bath fan replacement was somewhat ridiculous, since the new fan had a plug that you just plugged into a socket, which I'm pretty sure is rare.  The 'under cabinet lighting' segment was ridiculous, since they basically screwed up a light under a cabinet and plugged a power cord into a nearby socket. But the cieling fan installation & replacement segment, the switches & sockets segment, the lamp repair segment, the fluorescent light fixtures segment, and the recessed lighting segments were pretty useful and good.",1373587200,,1208,5.211340206185567

8081943,2,B000B5XPNS,"The sound/video was not good for a how to DVD.  Also, it didn't give any explanations on what and why they were doing.  It was basically just cut this wire, buy the same type of product and replace the same wire where the old one was. (no kidding? I could have figured that out without the video) This is okay for someone with no electrical experience who wants to understand a basic idea of electrical devices.",1194048000,3,411,4.394736842105263
