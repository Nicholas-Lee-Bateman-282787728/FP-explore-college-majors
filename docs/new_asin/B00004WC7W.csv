1363164,3,B00004WC7W,"The matches on this tape were pretty damn good, especially the last three matches were the barbwire scenerios. The only thing that was not good about the tape was Toykyopop's commentary and their breaks between matchs were they goof around in the training ring.",1001808000,,261,4.954545454545454
1363165,2,B00004WC7W,"I was really looking forward to my first glimpse of the gamed Japanese hardcore wrestling, especially since this DVD has Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) and Terry Funk on it.  Well, I was bitterly dissappointed.  First off, if you are an ECW fan, I don't think this will excite you.  Other than seeing fireworks go off a few times during a match, these matches are way less exciting than your average ECW match.  If you are a WWF fan, you'll find these matches slow, boring, and extremely lacking in actual wrestling (with a few exceptions).
These matches have zero ""match psychology"".  They basically amount to the guys punching and kicking each other until everyone has had a turn in the bed of barbed wire, or the exploding fence or whatever the gimmick is.  There are some non-hardcore matches on here, which are also pretty lame, with the exception of the bonus match, featuring TAKA Mitchunoku (who you might know from Kaentai in the WWF).  I guess the rule is that you either have exploding barbed wired or wrestling, but not both.
Additionally, the commentating is HORRENDOUS.  These guys are terrible, and maybe that contributes the crappy quality of the match (a wrestling match DOES include commentary, folks), but they don't have much to work with.
What really gets me is that there is a special feature focusing on Hayabusa, and it shows very brief clips of him in some great looking matchups.  High flying moves and real wrestling.  Unfortunately, the match he's in on this DVD is a stupid exploding ring electrified barbed-wire ""deathmatch"" and he gets punched and kicked a lot and then thrown into said gimmick items.
I give it a 2 instead of a 1 simply because you don't see exploding ring matches a lot, and it was interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD by a long shot.",1001116800,2,1789,4.686900958466453
1363166,4,B00004WC7W,"The leatherface match is basically cut in half, which means it is a little boring.  The Terry Funk + Mr. Pogo vs. Hayabasa + Masato Tanaka match is sick.  Mr. Pogo pulls out a knife and stabs Tanaka in the back.  There is a sick bump when Terry Funk and Hayabasa fall on some broken glass and nails, both are cut up really bad.  The ring explodes and they all are hurt really bad.  The womens match:  Megumi Kudo vs. Combat ""Mother in Law"" Toyoda is a good match.  Both give it their all, and it is Toyoda last wrestling match.  The Cactus Jack match against Kanemura is a sick match also.  Both take sick bumps on the broken glass and nails, and also the barbwire.  The announcers crack me up for most of the video, then they start calling each other gay and stuff like that.  Overall this video gets a four star rating.  It would have five if the Leatherface/Mike Awesome match was in full.",992390400,,892,4.275449101796407
1363167,4,B00004WC7W,"Out of the first four US commercial releases FMW has made, this tape is by far the best. The last two matches (i'm not counting the bonus matches here) are highly dramatic, especially Kudo vs. Toyota, which is easily the best match of the tape. The story, selling, and build to the spots in Kudo vs. Toyota are all excellent. Cactus vs. Kanemura, and the tag main event are both very good too (although there are some serious flaws in the tag match). The first three matches on the tape aren't good, and as always for these FMW tapes, neither is the English commentary. I recommend that anyone who interested in picking up one of the FMW US commercial releases should pick this one up first.",992131200,,691,4.492063492063492
1363168,5,B00004WC7W,This video has the best wrestling I have ever.... eeeeeeeeeever seen! You may not know half the wrestlers but this video is worth it just with the womans electrified barbed wire match. Makes HIAC 98 look like a WCW hardcore match. You must buy this video.,992044800,,255,4.565217391304348
1363169,2,B00004WC7W,"I'm from the Uk and i'm an avid ECW fan, and with all the FMV stars such as Tanaka, Awesome, Team No respect etc etc that made the crossover to the states, i thought why not get hold of some FMV footage. No i cannot say that all FMV stuff is this bad because this is the only stuff i've seen, but this DVD is terrible. The cover trys to use the Cactus Jack match with Kanemura as its main selling point, and this in its self is a terrible match. I must admit though i was Pleasantly surprised with the Women's Electrifed barbwire match, this for me was the highlight of the DVD and a exceptional match between ""the mother in law"" and Megumi Kudo. Besides that the DVD doesn't hold many other selling points and even the main match up at the end between Terry Funk-Mr. Pogo vs Hayabusa and Tanaka was very poor. I'm sure there are better FMV DVD's than this, so stay clear.",991699200,,872,4.196428571428571
1363170,3,B00004WC7W,"If you're more than a casual WWF or WCW fan and want to watch some wrestling action that's a bit different, then this tape is worth picking up.  I know that I've only given the tape 3 stars, but with the clipping of the matches and the horrible commentary, I can't give it 4 stars.  The first two matches are decent, for what they are - the first a squash match and the second a women's garbage match - but the rest of the DVD is quite good.  I actually liked the Megumi Kudo/Combat Toyoda match, which surprised me, as I can't get into womens wrestling.  Hayabusa & Masato Tanaka vs. Terry Funk & Mr. Pogo was pretty cool, but since this is showing off the deathmatch show, Hayabusa isn't able to work towards his strengths.  Mick Foley has a great match as Cactus Jack takes on Kanemura.
Also, there's a bonus match of TAKA Michinoku vs. Koji Nakagawa that looked like it would've been really good, but they only give you 7 minutes or so out of the 19 minutes that the match lasted.  If you want to see a good overview of what FMW is all about and get a decent introduction to the wrestlers and whatnot, then pick this DVD up.  And set the audio to the original Japanese commentary.  Even if you don't understand what is being said, it's more interesting than what the American commentators have to say.  I'd always thought that the commentators should know the names of the moves that the wrestlers use...",978739200,,1408,4.384615384615385
1363171,4,B00004WC7W,"When I got this home I was a little disappointed to find that the disc is made up of 8 matches from the 5-5-96 show and tokyopop made no indication that it wasn't actually a tourney.  Strange title considering IWA had the deathmatch tourney! Aside from that the matches are excellent and if you can withstand the dull and useless commentators you will find some highly entartaining and hardcore matches.
Highlights include Mick Foley as you've never seen him before in a brutal double hell barbed wire glass crush spider net death match and another highlight is two women having one helluva wrestling contest in a ring surrounded by electricifed barbed-wire!
A must for anyone who hasn't seen anything like this before and who wants to see how seriously the Japanese treat it as a sport instead of entertainment.
Oh yeah, its region free as well so it will work on ALL dvd players!",977702400,2,881,4.720779220779221
1363172,5,B00004WC7W,"I must admit, seeing this on DVD totally surprised me. You must understand, as wonderful as puroresu is, it seems that it has little chance of becoming popular in the states--probably due to the lack of disqualifications and no-contests we see in the American variety. Anyhow, I must admit that I've seen better from FMW--just not on any DVD's you can find at a store. If you are a fan of any American wrestling, I would recommend that you see this if for no other reason than to see what's happening in the Nippon. Puroresu has been, and always will be, more enjoyable and more atheletic than any WWF or WCW ...-athon.  Specifically, this DVD is quite good, with some of the better matches in FMW history being featured. I was disappointed that Atsushi Onita was not included, but I suppose this can be overlooked by anyone who is not familiar with the FMW. On this DVD American fans will see: Mike Awesome, Cactus Jack, Terry Funk, Masato Tanaka, Taka Michinoku and Hulk Hogan's nephew, Horace Boulder amongst others. The match between Combat Toyota and Megumi Kudo could be called one of the greatest matches FMW; and for that matter, wrestling in general, has ever put out. Really, if you're a fan of the FMW, All Japan, or simply a casual, American viewer, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.",977011200,,1301,4.656521739130435
1363173,4,B00004WC7W,"One of the easiest ways in the US to get a taste of hardcore ""garbage"" Japanese wrestling. Not for the faint hearted - the best matches are the bloodiest. Painful matches include: a ""Double Hell Barbed Wire Glass Crush Spider Net"" deathmatchwith Cactus Jack vs. Kanemura, a ""No Rope Exploding Double Hell Timebomb"" deathmatch with Mr. Pogo, Terry Funk, Tanaka, and Hayabusa, and even a no-rope exploding barbed wire female wrestling match!
As with the other FMW tapes, the announcers try to imitate Insane Clown Posse's funny wrestling tapes, and fail pretty miserably at it. The DVD is recommended since you can turn the announcers off, and you get one pretty good bonus match to boot.
Note this is NOT the IWA ""King of the Deathmatch"" tournament that made Cactus Jack and Terry Funk famous.",976233600,8,792,4.874074074074074
7924992,4,B00004WC7W,"First off, I can tell you I admire hardcore wrestling fan!

This VHS matches were pretty good.

1. The match between Cactus Jack VS Kenemura was excellent, I also like the use of barbed wires.

2. The match of terry funk, was best fight that same evening, great death match.

In addition, the other matches were good too.

The only thing that pissed me, is that the tape several small matches.

But after all, it is recommended to order this tape who like hardcore wrestling!

Thanks for reading...",1360368000,,498,4.590909090909091
7924993,1,B00004WC7W,"With a name like ""Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling"" and the legends told of its deathmatches, I was expecting a phenomenal mix of scientific wrestling and hardcore, like ECW was.  This could not be further from the truth.

Virtually all the matches but two feature little to no real or impressive wrestling, about the equivalent of a modern-day episode of WWE Raw or Smackdown.  Then the garbage comes in, with hardcore weaponry so ""extreme"" as to become campy and ridiculous.  In several matches, the wrestlers use a scythe-looking hook, and in the main event, one guy literally uses a kitchen knife on Masato Tanaka's back.

While violence is definitely a plus, there was little substance to any of it, as the company seemed to up the ante on violence to such a degree that it becomes campy, with electrified barbed wire, wooden tablets covered in barbed wire, broken glass, and nails, and an exploding ring.  And not the kind Cactus Jack and Terry Funk had with some C4 explosives around it, but the entire ring exploding in a masterful pyrotechnic display, but ultimately useless in the match.

The main event was an absolute disaster, with none of the superstars but Hayabusa putting much effort into their actions.  Even the Hardcore Legend, Terry Funk, appears lazy and uninterested in this match.  The whole match was a garish, campy sale of ""LOOK HOW VIOLENT WE ARE WE'RE TOO GOOD TO PUT ON REAL WRESTLING!"" and it's difficult to buy into it.

Add to this horrible commentators barely paying attention to the matches, and the most boring and charisma-devoid promos before each match this side of Bobby Lashley and Hardcore Holly, and you have FMW King of the Deathmatch.  The best (or worst) in Japanese garbage ""wrestling"".",1195689600,,1732,4.877133105802048
7924994,4,B00004WC7W,"Nanjyo vs Jason the Terrible- Nanjyo hit some impressive high impact moves. However the entire match is only 5 minutes. It wasn't violent at all, why is it on this DVD? Grade C-

Mad Dog vs Shark- This is a women's match. It stated out ok, we saw a flaming stick, a sickle, and a bull rope. It was looking decent but then a quick finish. Grade C-

Horace Boulder, Mike Awesome, Ooya vs Super Leather, The Headhunters- I was very excited about this match since I like many of the wrestlers. Horace stinks, but does an ok job. Oooya wasn't seen at all. Mike awesome put on a super match, he is truly Awesome! Super leather was very good, and the headhunters are very athletic for 450 guys. Another 10 minutes and some more fast paced action would have made this an A. Grade B-

Cactus Jack vs Kanemura- AWESOME! This is a great match, its very brutal, and goes back and forth. They use a great deal of moves on glass, barbwire and nails. Great finish! Grade A

The Mother-In Law vs Kudo- This is an electrified barbwire match. It has a lot of promise since its Mother in Law last match. The matches started out a bit tame neither of them wanting to go into the barbwire. However both of them took a few huge blows, and could barely stand. Both needed to be carried out of the ring. Grade A

Terry Funk, Mr Pogo Vs Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka- Holy S#@t!!! That is all I will say. Grade A+

Taka Michinoku vs Koji Nakagawa- Solid match. Good wrestling, but not a hardcore match. Not sure why it would be on a DVD called king of the deathmatch. Grade B-

Overall B+

The last 3 matches are just fantastic. Each one makes the DVD worthwhile. I wish they would have gotten rid of the first 2 matches, and added a few more solid matches. This easily could have been one of the top DVD's ever! Its worth getting.",1179273600,,1800,4.273529411764706
7924995,5,B00004WC7W,"HAYABUSA AND TANAKA VS. TERRY FUNK AND MR. POGO IS BY FAR MY MOST FAVORITE MATCH OF ALL TIME ! BARB WIRE ON TWO SIDES OF THE RING AND THE OTHER TWO ARE BARE ... AND THEN THERES THE BARB WIRE BEDS OF PAIN !

7924996,4,B00004WC7W,"First off this isn't the famous IWA Deathmatch tournament that had Cactus Jack Vs. Terry Funk in the finals, but from the FMW 7th Anniversy show from 96 (I think..). Except for the last 3, all the matches are MAJORLY and HORRIBLY clipped (about half the match) and the commentary is awful. Still the last 3 matches are some of the best Death matches you can find on DVD..

1. Bonus Match: Taka Michinoku Vs. Koji Nakagawa - Now were talking I.. Hey! Wha tha? They clipped everything?!! The Clipping totally messed up the pace of the match, more like a highlight reel - (DUD)
2. Jason da Terrible Vs. Nanjyo Hayato - Pretty neat spots early but it quickly becomes a typicaly quick RAW match (*1/2)
3. Mad Dog Nagayo Vs. Shark Tsuchiya - Womens Hardcore match, basically it's like seeing Mr. Pogo Vs. Cactus Jack in women's form. Typical bloody Garbage match but still OK.  (**)
4. Mike Awesome, Horace Hogan & Hiskatsu Vs. The Headhunters & Leatherface - Kind of a letdown considering Awesome and the Headhunters (One of my favorite tag teams, imagine 2 Abdullah the Butchers doing moonsalts outside of the ring :-) are in it. (*1/2)

5. Cactus Jack Vs. W*ing Kanemura (Barbwire, Broken glass match) - Now the REAL DVD starts. Barbwired-Ropes on 2 sides of the ring, other sides have no ropes and boards of barbedwire/broken glass laying on the outside to fall on. Ouch! Kanemura shows he can hang with Cactus by taking some outlandish punishment and cactus, like always, seems to bring some fun originallity to a death match. (****1/2)

6. Megumi Kudo Vs. Combat Toyoda - (Women's Electrified Barbed Wire match) Best match on the DVD. This is Toyoda's retirment match against her ex-teammate/(and lover?) Kudo. The ropes are lined with barbedwire AND electrified. The last two moves are two of the NASTIEST! moves you'll ever see. With the storyline, match, aftermath AND seeing Onita cry it gets my only perfect Deathmatch rating ever :-) (*****)

7. Hayabusa & Masato Tanaka Vs. Terry Funk & ""that crazy [...]"" Mr. Pogo (Electricfied Barbedwire / Exploding Ring Deathmatch) - Terry Funk and Pogo don't think Hayabusa/Tanaka have the ""heart"" (balls) to represnt FMW so they challenge them to a ridiculouly crazy deathmatch. The ropes are electrified with more boards of barbed wire outside the ring. And of course Mr. Pogo and Terry Funk bring there own toys along. Oh, and the ring with explode in 15 min. Kind of a let down, but you definitly gets to see everything you'd thought you would, Fire, Blood, Knives, Terry Funk swinging and slipping around the ring...

7924997,3,B00004WC7W,"This wasn't the best FMW DVD that they have to offer.

When it comes to death matches this pretty much serves its purpose, on exception of the very first match. The rest were bloody and brutal in true death match fashion.

I have to say that the Combat ""Mother in Law"" Toyoda vs. Megumi Kudo match is on my personal top 10. You don't look at them as just some female competitors tryin to wrestle like the big dogs. All you see are two intense wrestlers giving their all and producing a quality death match.

I highly recomend this tape to any fan of Hardcore wrestling and any normal wrestling fan. This tape is not for any weak hearted people. Especially when Terry Funk and Mr. Pogo face off with Masato Tanaka and Hayabusa. Violence and blood galore. It was so cool. Of course there are some explosions thrown in for fun. The other matches are ok. Jason the Terrible beat some Japanese mid-carder. Mad Dog beat the Shark by submission.
