6095900,5,B00GOT10SM,"The French animated feature film Ernest & Celestine is a ligthhearted and introspective animated film that draws you into the charming, quirky world of two unlikely friends. They go out on a limb to help each other, even if it means facing the consequences. The whole movie looks like a watercolour storybook come to life, with deceptively gorgeous character animation and a beautiful gauche colour palette.

The world of Ernest & Celestine is split into the bear world and the sutberranean mouse world. Both Ernest the bear and Celestine the mouse are outcasts from their societies, down on their luck and neither wanting to fit into what is asked of them. When the two agree to help each other out as their situations are especially bleak, they strike up an odd, charming and often hilarious friendship.

With both lots of humour and beautiful, heartfelt moments, Ernest & Celestine is a beautiful reminder of the simple, poignant beauty that animated movies can bring to life.",1403740800,,979,4.963414634146342
6095901,1,B00GOT10SM,This is a very spastic movie.  My kids were bored to death.  Big waste of money.  I wouldn't recommend this movie.,1403740800,4,114,4.333333333333333
6095902,4,B00GOT10SM,The drawings for this animated feature are very much French in style; at least they look like the drawings I've seen in other French picture books. The story is both for children and adults to learn a lesson about prejudice. If you are watching with really young children (4 or under) be sure to be present when the bear is about to eat the mouse. It might be scary for them. My grandchildren enjoyed the story overall. It was fresh and the drawings were lovely and interesting. It was like a book but everything on the page could move.,1403308800,6,536,4.424242424242424
6095903,5,B00GOT10SM,"The animation is refreshing especially now-a days that everything is computer animated. I love the dynamic between the main characters. The voice acting was great as well. I really enjoyed this movie, glad I bought it.

I gave it five stars because I fell in love with the story and the water color animation was refreshing to see.

It's enjoyable to watch. I didn't have any expectation so I liked the movie.

I recommend this to adults and kids alike that loves animated movie.
The ending made me happy... :)",1403222400,2,510,4.644444444444445
6095904,5,B00GOT10SM,"This movie stole my heart!

I randomly found a trailer during some channel surfing, and on a whim, decided to pre-order (I'm a sucker for independent animation). So glad I did!

It's a story about a friendship between the most unlikely couple--an orphaned mouse and down on his luck bear. Together they break some laws and become fugitives from their respective towns. While on the run, they overcome social barriers and cultural stereotypes between their two societies to become the closest of friends.

The water color animation give an endearing and childlike effect--almost as if your reading one of your favorite childhood bedtime stories--and it's a highly unique art style (addicting to watch).

Just a note, there are some  themes of theft, so be prepared to have a conversation with any little ones that might watch!",1403136000,22,825,5.036764705882353

6095906,5,B00GOT10SM,"So far, my favorite film of 2014 (2012 Original French Release). I want to try and stay away from using terms such as ""Joyous"" and ""Endearing"", but at its core, that's what Ernest & Celestine is, and where it shines. It's been many years since a film has made me feel a level of child like glee such as E & C was able to create with its superb watercolor art style and simplistic physical gags (each one executed flawlessly), not to mention touch on the subjects of family, friendship, and prejudice while staying sweet, effortless, and entirely non-malicious. Fantastic family fare, for young and old, children and parents. Do your self a favor and purchase this film. You won't be sorry.",1401667200,39,689,4.655737704918033
6095907,3,B00GOT10SM,"What stands out is a curious blend of charm and tooth-obsessed strangeness, and a wholesome message about friendship thats somewhat tainted by the characters Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid antics, but illustrated in a gentle style and with wonderfully subtle-yet-vibrant music. As the mug shots on the cover suggest, police get involved, so apart from the icky aspect of gathering teeth there's a bit of lawbreaking in this animated feature, so parents be warned. You might have some explaining to do if you have small, impressionable childrenFamilyHomeTheater.com",1401580800,8,564,5.494252873563219
6095908,4,B00GOT10SM,"This past year, with moviegoers so enamored by huge animated mega-hits like ""Frozen"" and ""Monsters University"", a lot of the smaller, more independent films, haven't been getting as much recognition. One that immediately comes to mind is ""Ernest & Celestine"", originally a French movie that after so much success at various film festivals, was converted into English. With a star-studded voice cast including Forest Whitaker, Paul Giamatti and William H. Macy on board, it received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars, and landed a considerable release throughout the U.S.

This hand-drawn comedy follows the unlikely, and forbidden, friendship between a young mouse named Celestine and a lovable bear named Ernest. Both confined to their respective worlds, with bears living above ground and mouses living under, they find solace when they are together. But as their love for each other grows, so does the disdain from their peers, and they must find a way to break from what is considered normal, and live the life they want to live, side by side.

With stunning animation, and refreshing performances by the whole cast, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Rated PG for scary moments, ""Ernest & Celestine"" was a delightfully funny movie that people of all ages can enjoy.",1398556800,66,1303,5.1415094339622645

If you just like stories of friendships in unlikely places, and a bit less sugar in your 'fairy tales' you'll love the story. This was a charming, delightful, movie I enjoyed tremendously. Not just for children, by any means.",1500768000,,303,4.735849056603773
6095922,5,B00GOT10SM,"Such a great, whimsical, and charming movie which will definitely make you laugh, get mad at the head ""moustress"" at the orphanage, and give you a warm feeling inside when it ends. It is about a friendship between a bear and mouse. The problem is this is socially unacceptable because of stereotypes learned by each species. if that wasn't enough, Ernest, well let's just say isn't the most respectfully known bear and Celestine is a poor orphaned mouse. However, they learn thru adversity that love and friendship are two of the most important assets one can have.  You'll laugh until you cry, find yourself rooting out loud for our protagonist, laugh and cry some more, and finally end the movie with a satisfying smile. Man, wish life was like that! :)",1496188800,,755,4.763358778625954

Our 7 and 10 year olds loved it! Super cute, funny, very heart warming film with amazing animation.  The movie also showcases Forest Whitaker's (voice) acting skills.

6096052,5,B00GOT10SM,"I love this movie! It's a great story about two animals, a mouse and a bear, who become friends. The mouse Celestine yearns to meet a bear, and Ernest least expects a new friend. All Ernest wants is food, but in the end he befriends Celestine who helped him. Both parties, ( the bears and the mice) think it is wrong for mice to be friends with bears and bears to be friends with mice. But as I said, both Celestine and Ernest become friends and they prove everyone wrong. The story teaches children that being prejudice is wrong and you should trust in what you believe in even if everyone is against you. It is a truly sweet story that is beautifullly animated. On top of that, it also takes place in France. I highly recommend it, once you watch it you won't forget it. It's almost like a storybook that came to life.",1461024000,,820,4.296774193548387

- It does a great job of portraying the world of the story.
- Watercolor animation. Never gets old.
- Captures the spirit of the old books perfectly.
- The movements, the screenplay, was all so fluid and just fun to watch.

Cons:
- None. As in, none. At all.

6096111,5,B00GOT10SM,"Delightful, wholesome film.  Instead of the usual morale in Children's films of 'be true to yourself', this film's morale was to be true to your friends, and to love your neighbor, regardless of their race.
The animation was beautiful, the humor was excellent and completely clean (no toilet humor), and there was no objectionable language.  Celestine's nightmare scared our toddler, but only lasted for a few seconds, and she was immediately comforted by her friend on-screen.
While this was a Children's film, it is also very entertaining for adult fans of animation, and has an engaging story with an unpredictable plot.
[Spoiler alert!] My only concern is that stealing is not punished, instead being written off with the excuse of ""he was hungry!"" (this includes stealing a car and robbing two stores.)

It encourages the meaning of being true to oneself and stand your  ground for what you believe is right  and not what is imposed by society.

6096178,5,B00GOT10SM,"The story is a charming one: An unlikely pair becoming fast friends and, in the end, reach for their dreams, together. It's perfectly chaste, but there's a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-and-Juliet/dp/B00AMEZDPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo and Juliet</a>&nbsp;quality about their friendship in the face of objections from each one's family and community - or maybe more of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guess-Who-s-Coming-to-Dinner/dp/B000TXP56C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</a>&nbsp;feeling, toned down enough for a children's story.

It's not the story I'll remember this for, though. It's the gorgeous, painterly animation. According to the extras, each scene had to be animate three times: once for the line work, again for the color, and yet again to put the physics of watercolor paints into each frame. Whatever they did, it works, and works beautifully. The watercolor feeling gives this a gentle feel, and ties the imagery together into a unified whole. Even more, though, it gives an expressive range that normal animation can't approach: dense, dark cellars, busy city scenes, or lone characters as the sole mark on the page. The artistic crew really got it, and made it come to life. I can think of only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-other/dp/B00PHSDS0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one other</a>&nbsp;animation that uses that look and, as much as I love the other, E&C mastered it.

As a kid's movie, I imagine it works well - but haven't kid-tested it myself. But, as a distinctive achievement in animation technique, I recommend it to anyone who loves the medium.

Trying to find the right movie has become somewhat of a chore, and Ernest and Celestine managed to bridge the gap, bringing its innocent charm to the screen in such a way as to transcend the natural divide between age ranges.

The story is also entertainingly whimsical, without the cringe-worthy stupidity of more films aimed at children.  The narrative is sweet without hitting you over the head with the moral.  The English voice cast is top notch and well suited to their roles.  I literally watched this film three times in a row just to drink in the nuances.

The humor ranges from slapstick to intellectual. You will learn. The sub-text of cultural and inter-cultural conflict and ignorance is highly instructive, but the learning never gets in the way of the humor.

Even more than necessary to pass off as anime. And the story is heart-warming every step of the way. You quickly fall in love with Celestine. She's cute as a button and sharp as a tack. Ernest however, is very rough around the edges at first, but quickly sweeps ypu off your feet. This is a must-see for all animation lovers regardless of their genre of choice.

6096366,4,B00GOT10SM,"This was an adorable little movie with a beautiful  art style that I highly recommend to anyone who is a big fan of animation!
A few things worth noting however is that the dubbed version was hard for me to watch. Not because any of the performances were bad but because you can clear see that it was dubbed via the lack of lip syncing which is understandable. And the plot that brings are two protagonists together and takes up climax of this movie is not quite well excutied with what felt like an message that didn't fit what was happening.
However, the real meat of the movie wasn't its plot, it was Ernest & Celestine themselves. Had the movie just been about these two interacting with one another I would have been more than satisfied. As it stands now, it's good and I'm still  happy with what I got but I feel like it could have been even better.

It was a pretty good movie. It looks like they put a lot of work into it.  The drawings they used for frames looked pretty complex.",1427068800,,161,3.7058823529411766
6096456,2,B00GOT10SM,"Somewhat entertaining for some children but there were some pretty controversial themes involved.

*Spoilers in my review* - The main characters stole things and evaded police.  They then hid out from the police - knowing what they did was wrong, they still hid... even camouflaging their getaway car (all with happy music in the background).  When they were taken to court, the police and judge were made out to be terrible characters (and scary music in background).  They were being accused of the things they did wrong.. stealing from stores, stealing a vehicle - but then the main characters turned it around asking why they couldn't be friends with bear / mouse...

I just didn't get it.  If they wanted to make a movie about a bear and a mouse becoming friends and overcoming stereotypes, there could have definitely been a different way to get there - without the crime and making police out to be the bad guys.",1427068800,5,919,4.748427672955975
6096457,5,B00GOT10SM,"Loved it.
A warm, feel-good movie about two unlikely friends who, against all odds, become best friends. A charming movie with beautiful and sorely-missed 2d animation. There are a few plot points that are brought up, but aren't really expanded such as the mouse society being dependent upon teeth or the young bear's conflict with his parents' wishes. And some parts do feel a bit rushed like the titular characters' rather sudden affection towards each other and the conflict with the stolen van. But these flaws do not interfere with my enjoyment of the story often. This is not an action-packed or complex story, but if you want a nice movie which will make you chuckle and smile, watch this.",1427068800,,696,4.808333333333334

6096603,5,B00GOT10SM,"I watched this with my 10-year-old son, who was dubious about this film. But we quickly realized what a beautiful, quirky, and unique movie it is. Wonderful painted backgrounds and unusual world of mice and bears. It reminded me of a Miazaki movie, but with clear French sensibilities and humor. I put this in that class, along with ""Secret of Kells"" and a few other gems. These films make animation a relevant and evolving medium.",1423612800,,431,4.76

6096606,5,B00GOT10SM,"What a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I wish animated films like this would get more attention.

The biggest theme for this film  is ""if you confront your fears you might just find an inspiration"". Starving Ernest and Earnest Celestine show their respective species to not fear what lies beneath (or above) and who knows what you might find.",1423267200,,338,4.912280701754386
6096607,1,B00GOT10SM,"The graphics are simply beautiful. However, the movie message is socially irresponsible. When Ernest & Celestine become thieves, and hide from the police, the police and court officials are made out to be the bad guys for catching and punishing them. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie for young children.",1423180800,13,314,5.3
6096608,4,B00GOT10SM,"I first found myself watching Ernest & Celestine while looking for Studio Ghibli items on the Amazon website. Just seeing the poster for this movie, it was drawn in a style that caught my interest. Its drawing style, the way the movie is animated, the atmosphere alone emanates a world of its own. It is welcome to see drawn animation in this decade as a feature length production; it is something that is becoming forgotten in the world of 3D/CGI animation that dominates the box offices in the USA.

Whilst it is beautifully animated, the plot is a bit contrived at points which takes away from the natural flow of the story's progression. It's not that I even need to specifically designate what exact scene and exact moment to show the manufactured emotions being played. It's spoon fed to the viewer, showing them directly (not giving them a chance to think for themselves) that the two main characters are the same, that they are forced from their own worlds because they do not fit the norm of their society, that they are all alone and no one is there for them but themselves; by doing those points the pacing feels rushed at times. While there are low points as such, there are strong points too, one being where Ernest has to overcome his own prejudice towards the thought of sharing his home with a mouse. The symbolism, while overt at times, fits in well, building the atmosphere of the movie even further.

The last thing that can really be mentioned is the light-heartedness of the movie; how seriously are we supposed to take the movie when it comes to certain aspects in it? Stealing a vehicle (plus the other theft(s) that happen) and not having any repercussions is absurd in our society, but do you really think that is the message people are going to be taking away from the story? No, it shouldn't be. It's simply, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" That no matter what society tells you what something is to be, you should not have prejudice towards that something.

All I can say is if you're a fan of animation, you should check this movie out. While the plot is simplistic at points, it doesn't define the entire movie. 4/5 stars, would recommend.",1423180800,,2172,4.592783505154639

It is noteworthy that, during the same period, my son intensely disliked the overly loud, overly violent, story-light American films.

I think that at least recognizing that their actions caused some harm, and might have caused more, and at least apologizing or working to pay for the damage, would have made for a more meaningful ending.

6096694,4,B00GOT10SM,"I'll start with the cons, and scroll down to see the pros.

CONS:
Only one - and this is the only thing that caused it to be 4 stars instead of five. It's dubbed into English! I see other people's review mentioning things like ""this film is filled with star studded voice actors"". I do believe that the voice actor matters, but it's just not my personal priority when watching animation. In the intro credits, everything shows French names and French studio production, but my heart shatterred when the character started speaking English! I LOVE foreign films and hearing foreign languages with English subtitles. I saw that Amazon UK has this film streamed in French with English subtitles.

PROS:
- I put the language issue aside and gave it a shot to watch this. What an amazing animation! Love the watercolor hand drawn style when a lot of film makers opt to use computer generated images for cheaper and faster production. No disrespect to these people. I'm just saying it's a nice change of scene.
- Great story about friendship and survival  -against all odds- of a mouse and a bear, whose unique talents are undermined in their respective communities. Definitely a good and timeless family film to have. A lot of funny scenes.",1420070400,2,1234,4.757009345794392

(2014)
. . . . .

If you're looking for a break from the Disney formula, you might want to add this quirky animated feature film to your kids' movie menu.  ""Ernest And Celestine"" is a weird, whimsical, unpredictable French film, loosely based on a popular series of childrens' book from the 1970s. This joins other recent European imports such as ""Cat In Paris"" in offering a very different narrative and moral sensibility from the more bland, formulaic model of American cartoons.

In ""Ernest And Celestine"", the heroes are outlaws -- Celestine is an innocent but open-minded child-mouse who befriends a gruff old bear named Ernest, despite the deep fear and prejudice that mice (in her world) have towards bears. For his part, Ernest is a scoundrel through and through, a scofflaw who once he falls afoul of the police simply doubles down and becomes a true outlaw. Although the unlikely duo are victims of persecution, they are not goody-twoshoes by any means, and while the story ultimately gives them the moral high ground, there are shades of gray that aren't always present in mainstream children's fiction. There are also implicit social critiques about class, racism and authoritarianism, presented with a distinctly European point of view. When we first meet Ernest, he is literally starving to death in his rural cabin, and his subsequent crimes -- busking, breaking and entering, auto theft and more -- are seen through the lens of poverty and need. Celestine is less a criminal and more an outcast, and her struggle against the prejudice of the mice against bears shifts the focus away from Ernest's more overt criminality, although she teams up with the bear and accepts his actions without complaint. They are ultimately redeemed when the hypocrisy and unfairness of the two cultures are revealed and seen to mirror each other, with cops and judges in both worlds uniting to chase the rebels down.

Some viewers may be uncomfortable with this moral complexity, others may cheer it. For those who are open to the story, this film also offers a delightfully rich visual experience, a celebration music and art, and liberal thought. There are some beautiful images and sequences, and a gentle tone that reveres nature as well as the human spirit. Highly recommended!

Also, it has an important underlying message;  if we don't don't drop our childish objections to other people and their different beliefs and all try to get along together we're doomed---it could easily apply to world (and local) events of today.  We were so happy with it we sent copies to several friends and relatives who live in places where very few foreign films are shown and they loved it.  By the way, be sure to get the
ENGLISH version of this movie if you order it, unless you understand French and don't mind the subtitles.

It's not a perfect film, and probably could have stood to have some parts expanded on or changed a bit, but it's so very lovable, gorgeously rendered (I mean really, it looks like watercolors come to life), and wonderfully realized, it's very easy to overlook any of its shortcomings.

6096799,5,B00GOT10SM,"First, a technical gripe: I always prefer the original audio, and the subtitles are a bit poorly formatted--what could easily fit into two lines pops up as one long/one short/one long line, sometimes covering up poor little Celestine, and no amount of fiddling with my viewer's options will correct it.

The movie: One reviewer called it ""almost perfect,"" and that's the truth. To put it kindly, the ending relies on some Horatio Alger-grade coincidence--and a pair of judges who appear to simultaneously completely yet temporarily lose their minds--to pull off a happy ending. And there's still the fact that Ernest WAS merrily going to eat Celestine alive when they met...

But the film doesn't shy away from that creepy incident (C&E argue about it even at the end), and in fact once he gets his marbles back the Bear Judge is probably the most incredible minor character I've seen in years. The rest of the movie is so utterly, wonderfully fun and heartwarming that minor flaws are easily overlooked. The beautiful hand-drawn/watercolor animation is astounding, but serves the story and characters without overwhelming them, even when it takes over to express Celestine's artistic visions. The score is delightful, and the acting (in the French audio, I still haven't watched the English dub) is flawless.

Can't recommend it enough.",1406160000,12,1337,5.123853211009174

Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks may have the best in digital animation but this film has more heart and character than either of the big movie companies. I bought this movie based solely on word of mouth(never see a preview or even known about) and I feel it is money well spent. buy this movie. buy it now.",1406160000,,556,4.157407407407407

6096806,5,B00GOT10SM,"I am a big movie fan from years back and particularly love well-made animated films.  Among my favorites are the best of Disney and those from Japan, especially by Myazaki.  Ernest and Celestine manages to be quite different from my usual fare, but it grabbed me right away.  Even though the artwork is of a simpler style, it has an engaging charm to it, and the story really makes one care about the two lead characters and to be concerned about the predicaments they get into simply because they choose to go against the conventions of their separate societies.  It is the universal theme about overcoming differences and learning to love and help each other in spite of them.  Celestine is an adorable little mouse endowed with an inquiring mind, a spirit of adventure and artistic talent.  Ernest is a very large and gruff bear, but he also has artistic talent.  He is a loner who also does not fit well into his own society.  When the two of them become hunted outcasts, their bonding and mutual support is a joy to behold.  They get the chance to prove both that their friendship is a threat to no one else and that they can be responsible citizens.  I very highly recommend this film.",1405900800,3,1191,4.549295774647887

6096819,4,B00GOT10SM,"When I was a young boy, about seven years old, I remember standing at the top of the stairs in our old home in New England, staring down at this giant rat the size of a medium sized stuffed animal.  My face was probably laced with sheer terror, as the thing turned at hissed and bore those sharp front teeth, and my dad raced to grab a broom or something and then it was gone, almost as quickly as it came.  It squeezed its giant body into a hole the size of a quarter in the wall and disappeared.

I never saw it again, but Ill never forget it either.

But, mice are cute; right?

There is something jovially precious about Ernest & Celestine, a cute little film about two lonely critters uniting as one.  I have to say, I wasn't sure what to expect, but the film had its fair share of supporters who raved it quite a bit and were overjoyed when it received that Oscar nomination, and I have to admit that it was visually appealing to me in a way I hadnt expected either.

Sometimes you just need that nostalgic beauty of hand drawn images.

Ernest & Celestine tells the story of an orphan named Celestine, a cute little mouse who has been brainwashed to loathe bears.  She is an inquisitive little thing though, and she bucks common trend of bear hating to actually fantasize about befriending them.  At night, little Celestine is sent off along with her orphan friends to steal bear teeth because their teeth are falling out and they need their teeth to survive (and nothing is quite as strong as a bear tooth).  One night, after a VERY close call, Celestine finds herself in the clutches of a lonely (and hungry) bear named Ernest.  She helps Ernest find food in exchange for her freedom, and after helping him out of a jam, he offers to help her collect an exorbitant amount of teeth, making her a local herofor a second or two.  Yes, their jovial time is cut short when their worlds collide in a chase for justice as the two are accused of thievery.

But they just want to be friends!

The imagery and the score here are astonishingly good; just so beautiful to look at.  The opening scene, in the orphanage, is one of my favorite scenes in film all year.  It is just so gloriously cinematic, despite the intimate nature of the film.  But, despite those moments, there are many moments when the film feels sadly un-cinematic.  In fact, some of the segments felt like an episode of Little Bear, and it took me out of the trance I was in.

I really liked this, even though it didn't always feel consistent in scope and tone.  It is a charming little film that really strikes a chord, and the musical segments (especially towards the end) are just stunning to listen to, and really compliment the films message.",1404086400,8,2714,4.409638554216867
