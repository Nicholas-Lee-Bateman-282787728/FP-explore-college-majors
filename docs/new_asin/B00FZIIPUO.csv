6042204,5,B00FZIIPUO,When i think of epic action adventure movies the Indiana Jones series is the first one thing i think of. The third is definitely action at its finest mixing great performances with beautiful camera work and stunning set pieces.,1488931200,,227,4.846153846153846

6042208,4,B00FZIIPUO,"Be careful if you're buying the Blu-Ray for the digital copy as well. The disc set contains an itunes digital download code, but the product also clearly states on the packaging that the code may not be valid after December of 2015.  You can actually see this in the Amazon photo of the product at the bottom of the back cover ""Code may not be valid after 12/17/2015"". I was still able to activate it in September of 2016, for what its worth.  This is a Paramount release, but with Disney's acquisition of the property, distribution rights are subject to change.",1474416000,4,562,4.554455445544554
6042209,5,B00FZIIPUO,"Among the greatest action/adventure movies ever made. The story and characters are interesting. The search for the Holy Grail, while at first thought seems a little silly, is really done in the most convincing way. Connery is a great addiction to the cast. River Phoenix lights up the screen with a brief but very impressive performance. Delholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are fun sidekicks. The bad guys are menacing and believable. Practical stunts, great action set pieces, and an amazing score. After the slight disappointment of Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade was a welcome shift back to a more fun and focused kind of Indiana Jones.",1473897600,6,641,5.0
6042210,5,B00FZIIPUO,"Let's face it...Indiana Jones is awesome.  This is the last of the ""original"" IJ movies and it is a good one!  Indiana Jones has to go after his kidnapped dad in this one.  Nazis have captured him and it's up to Indiana to save him. This one involves the holy grail.  The fake grails bring death (you turn into dust) and the real one brings life and power.  This is a fun movie for all ages.  Really young kids might be scared a little during a few parts, but for the most part it is safe.",1470355200,4,489,4.041666666666667

6042228,5,B00FZIIPUO,Indiana Jones and the last crusade is the best one to me. I like it more than Indiana Jones and the temple of doom i mean i actually saw that movie in theaters. Back in 1984 and than it was raiders of the lost ark the original. But it still wasn't that good as part 3. So check it out for yourself if you didn't already.,1423440000,,320,3.8636363636363638

6042242,5,B00FZIIPUO,"This Blu-ray version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is truly fabulous, an excellent upgrade to my original DVD purchased over a decade ago. Harrison Ford (Dr. Henry Walton ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr.) and Sean Connery (Dr. Henry Jones Sr.) team up to provide, IMO, one of the best action adventure movies ever made, where they are in a wild quest for the Holy Grail, battling Nazis all along the way. It is cool that, at the beginning of the movie, we get to see a young Indiana (at age 13, in 1912) in what may have been his first recovered (and lost and, in later years, recovered again) antiquity. Though Last Crusade lacks the special FX available in more recent years, the entire cast, the plot, the settings (America, Venice Italy and the Middle East), the comic relief and, of course, the action, make for a rousing tale brought fully to life in this very high quality digital optical format, offering stunning visuals and dynamic sound. Last Crusade (and the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B00G0O9XAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>) in Blu-ray are definite must-own for Indy fans and must-see for those who enjoy action/adventure with a bit of fantasy thrown in for good measure.",1395187200,,1291,5.333333333333333
6042243,5,B00FZIIPUO,I'll be brutally honest first. I hate Temple of Doom and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But Raiders and this are a perfect pair of movies. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are absolutely fantastic in it and the story rocks. Brilliant and beautiful on Blu Ray.,1391817600,2,256,4.586956521739131
6042244,5,B00FZIIPUO,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I have seen this over 40 times and it gets better every time. Anyone who is looking to see a really awesome movie, you need to check this out.",1389830400,,183,3.8421052631578947
6042245,5,B00FZIIPUO,"My favorite ""Raiders"" movie. Love the backstory and byplay between Indiana and his academic dad played by Sean Connery. Looks great in Blu-ray.",1389225600,,143,5.260869565217392
6042246,1,B00FZIIPUO,"This one star review is due to the fact that the disc was badly scratched.  I ordered all three movies in the individual cases, and it is very obvious that they were pulled out of the cardboard sleeves of the full set package and put in the blue cases (scratches are in one direction, finger prints on one of the discs)  Two of them had very minor scratches, but this one had bad enough scratches that I will be returning it for replacement.  There is no way I can get three of these movies with scratches on all of them if it was random.  They must be pulling them out of extra stock of full sets to be re-packaged and sold as individuals.",1388707200,,640,4.178861788617886
8619731,5,B00FZIIPUO,"Director Steven Spielberg crafts a stellar endcap for his legendary action trilogy. We see a young Indiana Jones, played perfectly in character by River Phoenix, at the start of his adventures. All the way to Indiana Jones, played heroically and hilariously by Harrison Ford, through to his most religious quest yet as he searches for The Holy Grail.

Thematically, we witness Indiana struggle to find his faith as he once again must wrestle between science and religion. Additionally, Indiana must come to terms with his father Dr. Henry Jones Sr., played wonderfully by the ever delightful Sean Connery. Furthermore, Indiana has to pick from greed, glory, lust, or family. In regards to lust, Indiana wants love in the character of Dr. Elsa Schneider played by the sultry Alison Doody. Doody is not only gorgeous, but a cruel femme fatale and foil for Ford act opposite.

Concerning Spielberg's direction, Spielberg masterfully takes the audience from one thrilling action set piece to another. Every location around the world is a ton of fun. The action, fights, and dialogue is as good as this series gets. All Spielberg's clever framing, lovely vistas, long panning shots, and realistic set design is on point. The Last Crusade is Spielberg at his creative peak.

Musically, John Williams brings his classic score for Indiana Jones to life anew with his latest version of the theme. Adventure and mysterious are complemented by Williams' score in its wispy hymns.

Overall, Spielberg should have ended the entire Indiana Jones franchise in 1989 with The Last Crusade on a massive high note. This movie is still exhilarating, engaging, and hilarious. You should certainly watch the Indiana Jones trilogy, but stop there and do not bother with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Give The Last Crusade a chance and it will not disappoint!",1530489600,,1857,5.078688524590164
8619732,4,B00FZIIPUO,"My favorite Indy, but sad to discover this release has zero special features beyond two theatrical trailers.

8619736,2,B00FZIIPUO,"Great movie! However, this copy only offers the digital copy for iTunes which is unfortunate as I do not support Apple due to their unfair business practices. I would have been happy with Movies Anywhere, Vudu, Ultra Violet, Amazon, or even Google movies. I think it is a rather close minded choice for Paramount to make. If this is the direction Paramount is headed I want no part of them. I would have given four or five stars if the digital copy were a bit more versatile or if Paramount had at least been willing to offer me a digital copy with someone else when I contacted them.",1521676800,,584,4.416666666666667
8619737,5,B00FZIIPUO,"It came ahead of time and is phenomenal in Blu-Ray (only way to see it)! Great show and the Acting was terrific including Sean Connery & River Phoenix and Alison Doody. Well written-the best of the Indiana Jones Series. Lots of Great Stunts done with excellent Stunt Men. Petra (located in Jordon) is an incredible Carved Ancient Miracle accomplished over 2000 years ago. How did these Ancient people accomplish this? (As spectacular as the Pyramids) at the end of the Show; it showed the REAL Petra on location in Jordon. The inside was accomplished by great set-designing and, of course, a Steven Spielberg Movie is going to be spectacular. You can see an entire Documentary on Petra by going to Netflix. The rats in the picture were REAL and it took courage for Harrison Ford and Alison Doody to move through them, though they were overwhelming in numbers! Whoever played Hitler looked so much like him, I thought it looked just like him. Buy the Movie in Blu-Ray.",1521331200,,967,4.761904761904762
