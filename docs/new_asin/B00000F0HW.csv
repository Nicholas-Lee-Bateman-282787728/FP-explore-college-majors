7906109,5,B00000F0HW,"I saw this movie many years ago, and am hoping that it will be released on DVD in the near future. It opens with a family awaiting a visit from the maternal grandmother who lives in  the deep south. The family resides in an inner city apartment building. Thought the family is intact (two loving, employed parents), there is a hint of a problem with the elder son who is being influenced by the wrong elements. Due to problems with the grandmother's health, the entire family ends up going fro a two week visit to the small southern town where grandmother lives and the mother,(Cicely Tyson, excellent as usual) was born.  Though the family is hesitant about visiting the south,the visit changes the lives of the entire family. The small town strengthens family bonds which were beginning to fray.  The entire family begins to see a different view of the south. The ending is bittersweet. A Really Special Story!",1154908800,3,912,4.723270440251572
