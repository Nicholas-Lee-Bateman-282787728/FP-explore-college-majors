4597237,3,B0057O6ILY,"This is an average suspense story with some above-average medical insights. ""Faces in the Crowd"" illustrates what it feels like to be unable to remember faces, in the same way that the generally better movie ""Memento"" illustrated what it might feel like to have to cope with a complete loss of short-term memory.

I was especially attracted to this DVD because it coincidentally tied in with my current reading of Oliver Sacks and V. S. Ramachandran. These authors delve into puzzling neurological problems that people develop after suffering head injury. One of the most unusual of these syndromes is ""prosopagnosia,"" the inability to recognize faces. This is the dangerous problem that the heroine of ""Faces"" has after she is attacked by a serial killer.

Even though I'd read a lot of references to this condition, I had never before considered what having it would actually feel like, or what it would amount to in the daily life of a patient. Here it's shown as existence in a perpetual world of strangers whose faces subtly shape-shift every time the victim's attention is diverted.

As a viewer, this often left me as disoriented as the movie's victim. Also, I was at first inclined to disagree with this interpretation of prosopagnosia. I had always just assumed that the condition would manifest itself as an inability to attach the persona, the role, of ""mother,"" ""father,"" or ""husband"" to the appropriate face in front of you. But as I got further involved with the movie, I realized I was thinking of another, possibly related, neurological condition known as ""Capgras' Syndrome,"" or, more popularly, as ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers Syndrome."" With this condition, the sufferer experiences a continuity of identity of the people in her life, but maintains these people are imposters. ""That's not really my mother. That's only a clever simulacrum. She's so cold towards me, like a robot."" This condition though is deemed to be caused by some failure in the sufferer's centers of affect, rather than of memory. So that's another movie.

I came to realize that this movie had probably gotten the feel of prosopagnosia right after all. The condition would have to involve a perception of even someone close to you, like a lover, as a series of digitally discrete and somewhat different faces.

As clinically accurate as it might be, the movie does suffer from some logical lapses in its plot though. Wouldn't the heroine have been able to distinguish her boyfriend's voice from the killer's, even if their faces remained shifting enigmas? Why would her boyfriend have gotten so angry when he learned she didn't uniquely recognize him, and was using cues such as the color of his tie to recognize him moment-by-moment? It doesn't seem plausible that even the most cloddish of lovers would take that attitude. But the writers had to contrive the boyfriend's abandonment of his fianc in order to leave her vulnerable to the approach of the killer.

In general though, this movie is worth a watch. If you're looking for some suspense, if you can stand yet one more serial killer with an exotic signature, if you want to catch a view of the city of Winnipeg, and most of all, if you enjoy contemplating the workings of the human mind/brain - this is a film for you. I only wish there had been a commentary included. I'd like to have heard how the writer and director researched this very strange, revealing form of amnesia.",1321056000,2,3433,4.8799313893653515
4597238,4,B0057O6ILY,"This film has a genuine story line and some compelling characters.  Overall it's better than a lot of it's kind, for the fact the focus of the film is centered on the woman's condition and her ability and experiences in adapting and changing to her current situation.  Not marred by over the top stunt sequences and special effects, it's humble direction, strong cast and well paced production keeps the viewer guessing right up to the very end.  Where other films featuring a serial killer tend try to light up the screen with gore and fear, this one uses it more as a side plot that sits behind the detective work and the woman's experiences after the initial head injury.",1320105600,,674,4.647058823529412
4597239,1,B0057O6ILY,"Starting at the ending credits I am often alerted to a ""make money"" movie by such circumstantial evidence as the number of producers in the movie - in this case there were twenty. Second are acknowledgements in the  ""Special Thanks"" listings which usually means people with an invested interest in the movie - there were sixty. Both numbers way overboard.
As far as the movie the acting seemed overly method ""recite the lines"" and the storyline seemed too contrived to be believable or to emotionally draw the viewer in. Inadequate research into police interview protocols; psychiatrist interview methodology; school/teaching policy with regard to a teacher with her medical issues; even the rescue sequence seemed rushed into the script. Add the romantic connection between the witness and the detective and it all seems to just make a more marketable movie. Too bad, the subject is interesting in itself but seemed to be demeaned by the cheap soap opera presentation in this movie.
The story itself is essentially based on some pop psych cases that have been floating about for a few decades concerning people who, more commonly because of a genetic disorder and rarely through accident, cannot recognize faces unless they learn to use other visual or sensory cues.",1320019200,2,1267,5.091346153846154
4597240,4,B0057O6ILY,Movie was well put together and worth the price.  I liked it.... had me sitting on the edge of my seat during several parts.  Overall I give the movie a good rating.,1319932800,6,165,4.125
4597241,3,B0057O6ILY,"Milla has it made. She teaches kindergarten, lives with Bryce, a man who is near popping the question, and hangs out with a crowd of women not much different than ""The Sex in the City"" gang. Her horoscope claims she will meet a mysterious stranger. Her kids draw pictures of faces- all omens of things to come. The background noise is about a serial killer and rapist (in that order). Milla bumps into the killer one night and manages to escape by falling off a bridge. The killer has her purse etc. and knows where she lives. The twist to this tale is that Milla has a nasty bump on the head and can't recognize faces, even those of her friends and family. Simple things such as waking up next to Byrce (12 different faces), looking at her Facebook, and teaching kindergarten become nightmares from hell. The police detective investigating the case is depicted as a street smart New Yorker, sometimes harsh in his mannerisms.

Now to make things interesting, if not confusing, the film uses different actors (faces) for the same people to try to make us feel Milla's confusion. During this movie we get to learn that Marianne Faithfull is still alive and has been eating well.

The film is a slow developing thriller. The confusion aspect makes the film a bit weird, but not more enjoyable. Milla does a good job in the role and demonstrates she is not a one-sided character. The script is unconvincing, and through all the twists and turns seems to lack the depth that is required to make it enjoyable. For some reason I got the impression that women were the target audience of the film, i.e. a horror-thriller for women. I would be interested to see how women view this film as opposed to men.

4597243,3,B0057O6ILY,"This does not particularly stand out from the crowd of thriller movies which are glutting tv and movies of late.  That this involves a serial killer makes it join an even larger category.  The premise is that after the heroine falls into the water while fighting with the serial killer, she wakes in the hospital and realizes she can't recognize anyone's face, even her own. Yet the serial killer has her phone and her purse so he can definitely find and recognize her. This is the original part of the film but the rest of it is pretty predictable.  I may have read one too many serial killer book and watched one too many serial killer movie. If you have not, you will probably give this more stars than I did.

4597244,4,B0057O6ILY,"""He's not stupid enough to go after the one person who can recognize him, right?"" After a night of drinking with her friends Anna (Jovovich)decides to walk home alone. While walking she sees a murder take place and is attacked by the ""Tear-Jerked Jack"" serial killer. After falling off a bridge she wakes up as the lone survivor. She also wakes up with a disease called face-blindness, a condition which affects you from recognizing any faces...even your own. Lately it seems like the lower budget movies are much better then the big blockbusters. This one is no exception. While this movie started to repeat itself to the point of being annoying it was still tense and keeps you interested and watching through out. Jovovich is becoming a very good actress and she continues to build upon what she did in ""Stone"". A pretty original idea that if it weren't for the repetition of the problem would have been an excellent movie. That said even with the repeating this is still a very good movie that is very much worth seeing. Overall, a surprisingly good and tense thriller that deserves more of an audience that it will get. I give it a B+.

4597283,3,B0057O6ILY,"SUMMARY: Elementary school teacher Anna Marchant survives an attack by a local serial killer, only to awake in the hospital, unable to recognize anyone's face, including her own. Diagnosed with prosopagnosia, or face blindness, she has to adapt to her condition, all while being targeted by person responsible for it.

WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: Jovovich is a good, though underrated, actress. She manages to impart Anna's confusion, frustration, terror, and helplessness to the audience with great skill. The storyline itself is very interesting. The serial killer angle aside, how would you cope when you're no longer able to recognize your closest friends and family?

WHY YOU WON'T: Sloppy writing. From Anna's perfect life at the start of the movie, to the hackneyed, cliched ending, the film never seems to get off the ground, let alone live up to its premise. Anna's friends are caricatures, rather than actual characters. Anna's boyfriend treats her with little sympathy or compassion after her ordeal, which is clearly a plot device. The overuse of many actors performing a single character is ingenious at first, helping to communicate to the audience the pathos Anna is experiencing, but quickly becomes annoying, and even stupid, once the actors no longer bear resemblance to the characters' originators. Even more inexplicable is Anna's total inability to recognize VOICES, especially as it's fairly obvious that, though characters might be portrayed by many actors, a single voice is used. Julian McMahon is almost unrecognizable as the paunchy, gruff cop who is written so one-dimensionally that it's offensive. The identity of the culprit is apparent long before it's revealed. These are just the highlights. There are many other problems with the film.

BOTTOM LINE: I really don't imagine this will appeal to those who are not highly enamored of Jovovich; there's not much else going for it. This film could have been outstanding but, sadly, it's barely mediocre.",1340755200,,1974,5.26031746031746
4597284,2,B0057O6ILY,"There is one unique idea in ""Faces in the Crowd."" The story of the thriller is abour a heroine with prosopagnosia, or face blindness. Milla Jovovich plays an elementary school teacher Anna Marchant, who suddenly loses ability to recognize faces including her own. This means she has to rely on some other specific items to identify people around her. What is really terrifying is that she has just developed face blindness after witnessing a murder of a serial killer.

There are thrillers with visually impaired heroines such as Audrey Hepburn's ""Wait Until Dark"" and more recently, ""Blink"" starring Madeleine Stowe. Unlike these films, ""Faces in the Crowd"" centers on a heroine who can see, but cannot recognize, faces including that of the murderer.

It is an original idea, to be sure, but its execution needs much improvement. Writer / director Julien Magnat (""Bloody Mallory"") spends so much time trying to let viewers share the unsettling experience of the heroine with prosopagnosia. It works to some extent, but not enough to make us forget the predictable and clichd storyline about the killer. The underwritten subplots about Anna's boyfriend and best friends do not help.

Milla Jovovich's performance is not bad, and the film gives some nice visual tricks describing the condition of being face-blind, but the story never gets interesting with a flat and one-dimensional heroine, and suspense-free storytelling.",1336780800,,1424,5.2368421052631575

4597289,3,B0057O6ILY,"YOU EVER WATCH A MOVIE and expect to get a better bargain than your're usually dealt? I have and this is exactly what Faces in the Crowd encompasses. On the surface, the concept of using ""Face Blindness"" (an actual medical condition with a wholly narrative name) or Prosopagnosia as its officially dubbed, is very, very interesting and for the most part the movie does a fairly interesting job with its depiction.

Story-line for the movie is simple as this:

Milla Jovovich's character, Anna Merchant, is living the good life; she's got a loving boyfriend, stock quirky best friends who think about sex 99.9% of their time together (one of them is portrayed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prison-Break/dp/B000FKO3GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prison Break</a>'s Sarah Wayne Callies, who is, deliciously awkward in her devil-may-care position as a sour woman who's inability to catch a date is tied to her bitterness toward men for passing her over for her friend) and a great gig as a elementary school teacher (or pre-school teacher, I dunno). However, one single night manages to ruin all of this when she accidently catches a serial killer, dubbed ""Jearterk"", in the act of raping one of his victims. In an attempt to escape, she's tossed over a railing of a bridge by the killer and suffers serious head trauma. The accident, at first, seems to have just left her winded and concussed. However, when she takes a moment to took at loved ones around her, she realizes the accident has done far more damage than originally thought. Ana begins to suffer from a rare condition dubbed ""Face Blindness"" and the worse part of it is that she wouldn't be able to recognize the killer if he were right in front of her.

For all the snark through Jovovich's way for being just a ""pretty face"" and a ""action girl"", Milla performs well in this movie. It's not a excellent performance (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Good-Deed/dp/B0000CDRW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Good Deed</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/45/dp/B000M343DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.45</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stone/dp/B0047T74CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stone</a>&nbsp;for something special like that), but she gets the turmoil and anxiety of Anna's situation across perfectly; one particular scene literally had me worried she'd rip her own face off because of the frustration toward not being able to recognize herself in the mirror. The gimmick employed to empathize just how serious her condition is --- hiring actors that share some type of resemblance to Callies, SGI's Michael Shanks, and Valentina Vargas --- is pretty neat. It had me fooled for about a split second before I realized something was different about certain characters. However, as time goes, the shifting faces start to look less and less like the original counterpart and more like a completely different person. And the worst part of that is, when they decide to use it in the climax, it comes off like a really bad ""Who's the real Bob? Bob #1 or Bob #2?"" scene from a television show. I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Maybe that was the point, but it just smacked of laziness to me. There's also the question why she couldn't recognize anyone by their voices or their gestures unless she's that unfamiliar with her friends and family.

Other performances were decent for the most part, nothing special, but nothing awful either. Julian McMahon as the tough-as-nails cop that eventually falls of Milla's character is neigh unrecognizable as a overweight cop with a goatee. It took the entirety of the movie for me to finally acknowledge the idea that it was him and not some random guy because I kept looking for a ""suave"" guy in a slick suit and a receding hairline. The chemistry between McMahon and Jovovich is non-existent, I never thought for a second that these two could fall in love with each other and as one of the glaring flaws in this movie, it just came off as a cop taking advantage of an emotionally compromised woman. The way they decide to use the fact that McMahon's character's face is the only one that never changes, via inserting a hackneyed reason to create a basis for a relationship, is just a bad cover up for the actual one (he's second highest paid actor in the movie next to Mllla and thus isn't about to get his screentime cut down by a character actor). Everything about their relationship smacked of a screenwriter running out of ideas for his/her characters and worse, working under the belief that its the required thing to do because, oh gosh, she can't recognize her boyfriend anymore! Guess that means they weren't so love in the first place, despite the fact that everything prior to her incident implied otherwise.

Another incredibly laughable device used in the movie is the British Neurologist. She comes off as condescending to Anna's character, who goes to her for help for her condition, and worse becomes the apart of the Deus ex machina of the entire plot as it begins to unravel in its final act.

To its credit, Faces works its audience with the gimmick of unrecognizable faces and changing characters to its very limits. However, the thing that kills is are the obvious tells that manifest in the form of Horoscopes, flashbacks through hypnotic suggestion, lingering shots on distorted/ruined children's drawing and characters simply staring at their reflections. If a particular character is intended to die, the original actor that portrayed them will appear in a reflection.

The mere and constant implication that the serial killer is ""interested"" in Anna simply because she survived his attack literally gives away how the movie will end. They employ the presence of Julian McMahon in the same way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flightplan/dp/B004ITW7VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flightplan</a>&nbsp;used Sean Bean; you expect him to be the bad guy, but as the movie boils down, you steadily realize (if you didn't two scenes ago) it isn't him, the obvious perp is named and the killer you barely know anything about becomes a ranting, weeping, monologuing nut-case that's killed as a result of his own (or script induced) stupidity. And he spent the biggest chunk of the movie being the calm and composed best pal to the secondary protagonist, pretending to help a boy, the son of one of the serial rapists' victims.

The biggest insult, in my opinion, is how the movie ends. Its a Lifetime ending born of confection sugar and a voice over that just makes the already stifled dialog that much worse. Overall, while Faces in the Crowd is not a horrible movie, it is by no means a good one either. The first half hour is watchable if only for its concept, but its ending is really what kills whatever hopes it had for being ""special"". Its an average thriller at best.

4597290,4,B0057O6ILY,"FACES IN THE CROWD has an unusual premise:  a school teacher (Milla Jovovich) with a supportive live-in boyfriend (Michael Shanks) witnesses the latest killing of serial killer Tearjerker Jerk.  While attempting to escape, she falls off a bridge and hits her head before going into the water.  Awakening in the hospital, she doesn't recognize her boyfriend or her friends.  The diagnosis is a rare disease in which her brain can no longer process facial recognition---""face blindness"".  Since she witnessed the murder, police think she can help identify him.  Problem:  peoples faces keep changing so she's unable to provide any assistance to the detective (a pudgy, bearded Julian McMahon).  A psychiatrist (initially played by 1960s singer Marianne Faithfull) tries to aid Jovovich in accepting her bizarre new life.
I found the film refreshingly original and intriguing, well-paced and involving.  Jovovich is very good in her change of pace role.  McMahon underplays his role, coming across like a Tom Selleck clone.  The killer's identity is not a total surprise, but other suspects are convincing too.
In a cinematic climate of pointless remakes or reboots, it's nice to get an original, entertaining thriller.",1323216000,,1216,5.347368421052631
4597291,4,B0057O6ILY,"The premise of the movie is Face Blindness which actually is medically called, prosopagnosia, is a condition characterized by the inability to recognize or distinguish faces. Face blindness is a socially disabling condition thought to be hereditary or caused by brain injuries.  In our heroine's case she got this from a brain injury she received in escaping from her would be killer.  It takes a while for the movie's POV to really sink in that she cannot tell who is who but it is surprising that she has to see a Neuropsychiatrist (a psychiatrist who deals with brain trauma and diseases of the nervous system) played wonderfully by songstress Marianne Faithfull,  to figure out how to tell the differences.  Still despite the slow build up it works very well, and is very engaging.  I enjoyed it though the B quality visuals are at times funny in themselves...there are points that look very collagey and fake...oh Well.

4597294,1,B0057O6ILY,"Last night, I watched an excellent movie. It got every detail right, it had no loopholes, no head-scratchers, and a deaf character was portrayed brilliantly.  I came away from the movie thinking: ""I have to make room on my Top 10 list for this gem.""

Okay, so I'm being sarcastic. Sue me. (That was sarcastic, too. Please don't sue me! :-D) This movie brings to the forefront the importance for writers and filmmakers to get their details right. Yes, a few details will slip by, and I (yes, even I!) can overlook a few.

""Faces in the Crowd"" stars the lovely Milla Jovovich. She witnesses a killing, and the killer is alerted to her presence when her cellphone rings. The killer pushes her character into a river, but a homeless person is there to fish her out. Flash forward to when she awakens from a coma. She has a face-recognition disorder. Faces change every time she looks at them. She cannot recognize her own fiance, her best friends, or even herself in the mirror.

And a killer is most likely after her!

One of the people she turns to for help is a woman who specializes in this kind of  face-recognition stuff. They have a meeting, and the woman acts and talks as she should. Second meeting: the woman announces she is deaf. She looks to  be about 65ish, but when she was 16, a horse-riding accident caused her to become ""deaf as a post."" She gets by from lip-reading.

WHAAA? At this point, I paused the movie and gave my wife A LOOK. She knows that look. I've given her that LOOK  many times when we're watching a movie with a deaf (or hard of hearing) character. My wife knows me. She grinned big and said: ""Okay, you want to stop the movie?""

I laughed and said: ""No, let's finish this.""

Time to break this gem down.

1) This woman, and I quote from her, is ""deaf as a post."" She wears no hearing aids, no cochlear implants, no assistance, nothing. She relies on lipreading. Let me tell you something. Lipreading is not as easy as movies might make it seem. Some people are incredibly easy to lipread, yes. But even with these people, you understand maybe 90 percent, 95 percent, at best, of what they say.  For a shrink who works in a darkened room and who listens to patient ramblings, that 5 percent is critical. And that's assuming ALL her patients are easy to lipread. Many, many people are not. Milla Jovovich was not, and the policeman who worked on the case was not, either. One scene cracked me up with the policeman. He was sitting side by side with the shrink. He talked. The shrink understood him! My wife said: ""Wow. She can lipread from the side."" A few scenes later, the shrink said: ""Slow down! I can't read your lips!"" Good for another laugh.

Lipreading training helps. But this woman responded right away to what people said. She did not need to process anything. It was just ridiculous.

2) A 16-year-old who became deaf and who is now about 65ish would have developed a slight (at least slight) ""deaf accent,"" especially if she has no hearing aids or a CI. Even with speech therapy.

3) The deafness added nothing to her character. I'm perplexed why they made her deaf. They certainly did not portray her as deaf.

This movie has a lot of other problems going against it, too. Milla's character is a classic horror movie dumb blonde. For example, in one scene when a killer is after her, she runs from a populated area into a desolate area. In another scene, she's holed up in what is basically a safe house, and she gets a text purportedly from her ex-fiance to meet her. So she up and goes to meet him. Whaaaa?

Urgh. Stay away from this thing, unless you like watching movies that are so bad you have to watch them. In this case, fully recommended. It's a shame. The premise could have worked brilliantly.",1321228800,5,3747,4.469208211143695
