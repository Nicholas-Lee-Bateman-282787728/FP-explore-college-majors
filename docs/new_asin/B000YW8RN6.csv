3036640,4,B000YW8RN6,"NOTE: Some of the reviews here (like the one below by Grady) spoil the movie by basically giving you a plot synopsis, including the epiphany towards the end.  Read some of the reviews here with caution.

John August is someone who impressed me back in 1999 with a witty script for the zany ensemble piece entitled Go.  Directed by a up-and-coming director by the name of Doug Liman (Bourne Identity, Swingers), Go offered a straight-forward story that was constantly twisted due to a change of perspective as we saw the story from different characters.  The way it weaved in and out made the movie a lot more interesting that it probably should have been.

Now, we have The Nines, not only written by John August but also directed by him, and it shares a few similarities with his big debut, Go.  However, it's infinitely more intriguing, intelligent and frustrating than Go could ever be.  The Nines is comprised of three short stories featuring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy and Hope Davis playing different characters.

The first film has Reynolds playing a blockbuster actor who is in house arrest, with McCarthy playing a publicist and Davis the next door neighbor.  As the scenario continues, Reynolds' character becomes convinced the house is haunted.  The second film has Reynolds as an effeminate TV screenwriter who is being followed around by a reality TV camera as they film his progress to make a pilot.  During this, McCarthy plays Reynolds' best friend while Davis is a TV exec.  The final scenario has Reynolds, a high profile video game designer, married to McCarthy.  Their car breaks down in a forest and when Reynolds goes to find help, discovers Davis.

The way the film works is that each episode builds on each other, presenting a different perspective while also sharing common themes.  The way the puzzle pieces fit together and the epiphany towards the end of the film creates a startling new take on the film as a whole.  August does a terrific job of creating common themes and a central thread that goes between each episode and even when it's over and you still aren't quite sure what happened, you never feel cheated.

It's a very heady film that's more intelligent than a lot of films that share similar themes.  While I can't reference the particular films without going into heavy spoiler territory, I will say that The Nines touches on religion, philosophy, technology, reality and how everything intersects.  It also seems intent on discussing life as a whole and the entire concept of creation and creators.  It's no coincidence that all of the scenarios are based on people living a certain kind of reality that is more ""reelity"" than ""reality.""

The weight of the film rests on the shoulders of the terrific cast.  Reynolds, in particular, shows that he's more than Mr. Van Wilder and plays three starkly different characters with aplomb that belies his earlier roots in teen comedy.  This is by far his best role and it was amazing watching him in these three roles.  Meanwhile, The Nines also shares an actress with Go: Melissa McCarthy.  She steals the show and is a ray of light in every scene she's in.  Hope Davis is always enjoyable, and her characters play a very interesting role in the story as a whole, but, for me, McCarthy is tops.

The Nines is a film you'll want to watch with people who you can have an intelligent conversation with.  It's a complicated film that, unlike so many today, doesn't provide you with all the answers.  Even when the resolution occurs, you won't have all the pieces in your hands.  Watching the included short film is as close as you'll come to an answer.  So, the best bet is to watch it with people who will want to talk about it, because The Nines is definitely a talking-about film.

I'd definitely recommend it to fans of metaphysical puzzles and movies that don't provide easy answers.  An intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining film.",1201651200,42,3926,4.794642857142857

It is the only movie in recent time where after I saw it the first time, I STAYED at the theater and watched it again immediately. The story, and how the movie is structured, just pulls you into it and grabs your attention. The only comparisons I can make would be Donnie Darko or Eternal Sunshine. All 3 of these gently play with your mind and really make you think about the story - long after it's over. I highly recommend it.",1201132800,13,477,4.085106382978723

Intriguing and suspenseful storytelling with great visual style -- which did NOT surprise me, given that the writer/director is the same guy who wrote the films ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Big Fish,"" and ""Go.""

3036649,5,B000YW8RN6,"Excellent.  Weird in all the right ways, just a touch creepy, but perfectly so.  Really enjoyed this movie.  There was an author, Terry Pratchett, who once wrote about ""the other pants leg of time"".  In his book _From the Corner of His Eye_ Dean Koontz explores a similar theory beautifully as well.  This movie reminds me of that theory.  It's also going around, to some degree, in the world of physics, part of Chaos and String and a few other theories...But the thought that any decision, no matter how small, is always made, and something in the ""world"" breaks in the process.  There is another place created from that moment, where the other option was taken...or the hundreds of other options were taken.  It is a theory that encompases a thought process wherein there are a million possible universes, living one on top of the other, like layers of an onion.

I love this thought...because in this theory, there is a place, somewhere, somehow, where I got it right.  Where all the forces lined up as they were supposed to, and I managed to find the future that I was meant to be in.  And maybe, through some circuitous route...I can figure out how to make HERE, mesh up with THERE...And it'll all come right in the end.  :)

Lovely movie, well written, well acted.  Definitely worth a viewing.  :)",1465689600,2,1304,4.608695652173913

3036682,4,B000YW8RN6,"You'll find the movies in this collection by Mill Creek to be interesting, if nothing else. There is no running theme behind the four films. Mysteries, riddles & a revenge thriller are whats in store for you here. ""Slipstream"" would be the most interesting just by looking at the cast, and the involvement of Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins wrote, directed and starred in this film. He also plays some piano in the films soundtrack. It's one of three films he's directed over the years, and any movie starring him is worthy of a watch. All of the films in the set are widescreen, and all prints look excellent. Mill Creek has to be commended for continuing to put out a top notch product at an affordable price. I've seen this set at stores for five dollars. It's easily worth a pick up at that price. Here's a synopsis for each film.

The Nines

Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) and Hope Davis (The Weather Man) star in this clever, mind-bending thrill ride through the mind of an actor, a writer and videogame designer who arguably controls them all. The Nines consists of three short films, each featuring the same actors in different - and sometimes overlapping - roles. Together, three stories form a single narrative that explores the relationships between author and character, actor and role, creator and creation. Alternately funny and unsettling, this film is like a riddle where the answer is the question - How does it all add up? 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Slipstream

Written, directed and starring Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins (The Silence Of The Lambs), and featuring a top notch cast, Slipstream is an exciting and inventive drama about life and death and everything in between. Aging screenwriter Felix Bonhoeffer (Hopkins) has lived his life in two states of existence: reality and his own interior world. While working on a murder mystery screenplay. Felix becomes baffled as his characters start appearing in his life, and his life starts slipping into his characters. Soon, he is thrown into a vortex where dreams, time and reality collide in an increasingly whirling slipstream. 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Limbo

In the untamed wilderness along Alaska's coast, feelings and fortunes change as quickly as the tides in this haunting and hypnotic thriller, from critically acclaimed director John Sayles (The Spiderwick Chronicles). Traumatized by a boat accident at sea many years before, Joe Gastineau has given up his hopes for a life beyond the odd jobs he takes to support himself. That quickly changes when Donna DeAngelo, bar singer and nomad, and her troubled teen-age daughter, Noelle, enter Joe's life. Both mother and daughter fall for Joe, increasing the already present friction between them. The tension continues to build when Joe captains his ship on a mysterious sea voyage up the Alaskan coast, only discovering after it's too late that the trip may end up costing them their lives. 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Already Dead

Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard, Super 8) had it all: a beautiful wife, a powerful job, and a beloved son. But when an intruder breaks into his home, kills his son and brutalizes his wife, Archer's ideal life is shattered. When the police fail to find the killer, his therapist (Christopher Plummer, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) directs Archer to a covert agency that specializes in hunting down ruthless criminals. Now, hot on the trail of his son's murderer, Archer faces a decision having devastating consequences in this suspense-filled revenge thriller. 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

I hope Mill Creek Entertainment keeps putting out these 4 movie packs. They're perfect for a rainy weekend, and they're cheaper than going to the theater.",1376006400,,3782,5.116693679092383
3036683,4,B000YW8RN6,"I would recommend the film for fans of Ryan Reynolds.  He is a handsome actor and has great comedic timing.  Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy round out this strange three act film.

At times it is a little hard to follow; but, it really smacks of Outer Limits and Twilight Zone episodes in that you want to know what will happen next.

Strange cerebral aspects of the film are always lurking beneath the plot line that are not fully developed until the end. . . and even then, I'm not sure I totally got it.  But, it definitely kept my interest.

If you like Ryan Reynolds and an odd story line that isn't the usual Hollywood fare, I would highly recommend it.",1375056000,,659,4.360655737704918

Ryan does a very good job, especially as the second character he plays, the TV writer. I was surprised. And the timing, editing, mood, continuity of THE NINES are all very good. The cast is wonderful. Let's see more of everybody involved.
  PS--I live in Hollywood and ran into Ryan Reynolds, walking his dog, in the wild, after this movie was filmed, and, just now, watching THE NINES,I realized that where I met Ryan that day was actually the filming location of the last story.

We want to leave our mundane existences, buy some popcorn, and have FUN watching great, happy, well-filmed movies. If I could give this idiotic piece of existential garbage a minus 100 and get back that hour and forty or so minutes of my life - THAT would make me happy, too. To Melissa McCarthy and Ryan Reynolds - two actors I used to respect: you are not put before us, the people who ultimately pay you to ""act"" for a so-called living, to waste our valuable time. Yes, we probably live in tinyer houses than you and drive dinkier cars and make tons less money than you, but please remember that some of us actually have brains and aren't dumb. Do not let the immense hubris of Hollywood fool you that we, the little dumb audience cannot end your careers. Movies like this are best left in your in-house movie rooms.

This was deep,it really made one step back to think. It brought into question what reality truly is in the same way that films like The Matrix and Inception did. While the Nines didn't quite reach The Matrix bar, it's definitely worth watching.

As an audience, there were periods of confusion where you were utterly lost as to what was going on, but it wasn't for long and had enough intrigue to keep one hooked.",1325980800,2,554,4.54
3036700,5,B000YW8RN6,"This movie was great.  I enjoy movies such as PI, Donnie Darko, Inception, Never Ending Story, What Dreams May Come, The Machinist, Fight Club, Shutter Island, Last Action Hero, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Stranger Than Fiction, The Matrix, Final Destination, The Butterfly Effect, Jacob's Ladder, In The Mouth Of Madness, The Usual Suspects, The Illusionist, The Prestige, and Source Code.  It is unfortunate that nobody has really come up with a name for this genre, as over the past 10 years, more and more have been produced.

*** SPOILER ALERT! ***

If I were to categorize this movie, I'd say it was a combination of three particular niche genres.  The first I would call something like ""Character self-awareness"" because the character becomes aware that they are somebody else's creation.  The second I would call ""Fiction Invades Reality"" because this is where somehow, a fictional character is allowed to become real and enters the human world.  Last Action Hero is a good example of this type.  And third would be ""World In World"", because you find out there's an alternate universe existing outside of what you believe to be real, like the Matrix.

About 10 years ago, being a programmer myself and being aware of the game called ""The Sims"", it occured to me that maybe what we think of as ""God"" is actually an alien and we are just a SIM's-like game of his creation that he sometimes plays, but other times he just lets alone to evolve as it will.  This movie is the first time that I've seen that idea of mine expressed so clearly, that it feels as though they stole that idea from me psycically just like they stole the design for the transformer ""Hot Rod"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Takara-Masterpiece-Collection-Hot-Rodimus/dp/B00436G1IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Takara Masterpiece Collection Hot Rodimus</a>), who I invented in 1985 when I was 9.

Regardless, if you enjoy *weird"", mindfreak movies that make you think and have to pay attention ... (Maybe ""Puzzle MOvies"" would be a good term??), that are more involved and intricate in it's machinations and plot than a simple mystery, then you might really enjoy this film.

The stories are interwoven yet independant.

The character Gary/Gavin/Gabriel which start with ""G"" which looks like a 9 upside down. One of the his characters is gay, but not all three.

This movie is an allegory of the personal adventures of the Director himself.

The implications being one of Ego, not Extraterestrials.

This is a psychological film, not sci-fi. And as you can tell from the reviews, people are messed up on their God Concept.

Worth the five stars to see it exposed and in evidence on this review board. Imagine DaVinci's Mona Lisa coming to life and telling DaVinci that his painting skills of her are unflattering and lame.

3036710,4,B000YW8RN6,"The Nines tells the story of Gary, Gavin, and Gabriel with each character given a specific segment in the film. The first segment tells the story of Gary, an actor who has more than a few issues. The second introduces us to Gavin as we're given a reality TV show look behind the scenes as he tries to get his show onto the air. The final segment is about Gabriel, a married man who designs video games. All of the segments are related and focus around the number 9. Discovering the truth about these characters and what they really are is what really makes the film worth watching.

I had been wanting to see this for awhile and I finally got around to seeing it today. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. I haven't seen a film tie together multiple segments like this in a long time. Everything comes together quite well and it's pretty satisfying once all the cards are put on the table. Ryan Reynolds proves once again that his acting is quite strong and has more to him than being the casual funny man. Melissa McCarthy is also worth mentioning. She starts off being kind of irritating, but turns out being incredibly charming once the credits roll. Hope Davis was the last piece of the puzzle and is crucial to the overall story. At first, she just seems like the typical jealous and conniving female character who didn't get what she wanted. As the film progresses, however, her role becomes more interesting and it's revealed how important she is in Gary/Gavin/Gabriel's path to discovering what's really going on.

The Nines deserves a watch from anyone looking for something a little different. It'll definitely satisfy Ryan Reynolds fans and it'll probably meet or exceed what you expect from the film once it's all said and done. It surprised me quite a bit with a strong story, a great cast, and an incredibly solid script. Give it a watch. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The movie stars Ryan Reynolds playing three separate, and sometimes overlapping, characters in the three short films that make up this one story.  He blows the top off this movie with his portrayal of a writer, a troubled actor, and a video game designer. This is one of the most original films that I have seen in a long time.  I would have to say that Reynolds has finally broke through as a serious actor and shed the stigma of being another National Lampoons' puppet.  After watching this movie, I had to wonder why he ever did such horrendous trash as Van Wilder. The movie is hard to follow but it pays off.  It's a confusing concept but the director is able to pull everything together solidly by the end of the last short.  I hope this is the new direction that filmmakers are going to take.  Or at least they should.  John August has set a new standard, and it's going to be hard for anyone to keep up with him.

3036722,4,B000YW8RN6,"An actor has a bad trip after a bad breakup and ends up in house arrest -- but either he is losing his mind or he is not who he thinks he is and things are not what they seem.  This is one of those metaphysical puzzler films, that is fun and engaging at a number of levels but at its deepest has you working out what it all means.  In films like this you think they are going to back down from the broadest ambitions, that it's all going to be a dream or a game and everything will work out so that you can go home happy, since it didn't really mean anything and didn't try to say anything.  Luckily, this film went further than that.  It takes its conceit all the way and leaves you hanging at the end -- asking big philosophical questions like: what does it mean to claim, like Leibniz (as parodied in Voltaire's Candide) that this is the best of all possible worlds?  The film feels like Borges for the youtube generation, and really goes as deep down the rabbit hole as some of the Argentine's best puzzlers.  It's hard to be a lot more specific without spoiling the film.

The performances in the film, especially by the three leads (Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy) are uniformly excellent and surprisingly versatile.  There is nothing terribly unusual or interesting about the look of the film -- stylistically, the film feels a bit like television ... and this may be appropriate since one of the sequences of the film is about a director of a television pilot ... in fact this film feels like it could have been adapted for a television pilot, for a series I would definitely watch -- shades of Twin Peaks but grander in its metaphysical ambitions and humbler in its stylistic excesses.",1202169600,,1710,4.423566878980892
3036723,5,B000YW8RN6,"I rented this movie because I am a huge fan of Go.  The Nines shared a similar style: a few different stories that overlapped.

The first time I watched this movie, by the time the credits rolled up, my brain felt like it had been flattened, rolled up in a ball, and flattened again.  But in a good way.  I immediately had to watch it again.  Then I got ahold of a copy of the script and read that.  I still haven't returned the rental... I feel the need to watch it one more time... this time with the commentary on.

It is the smartest movie I've seen in a while that isn't trying too hard to be smart.  Some other reviews complained about the musical number.  It was definitely odd at first, but after watching it a second time, I couldn't imagine it without.

3036724,5,B000YW8RN6,"THE NINES is a film that may seem like a tough story to follow, but the concept and the 'autobiographical' script by the gifted John August are so fine that once seen, this film demands re-visiting.  It is tremendously entertaining, blessed with a superb cast, and offers food for thought far beyond the running time of the film.  For this viewer it falls into the 'brilliant' category.

More of an existential exercise than a traditional movie tale, THE NINES has the courage to challenge our concept of that is the real world, what is fantasy, what exists beyond our concept of our 'space' here on planet Earth, and just how significant is the current obsession with television reality shows and videogames on the way we are stuck in the present.  John August explores these issues by interweaving three stories, using the same actors to change vantages and personalities to raise questions and pose problems for the audience to attempt to resolve.  It works.

Part I ('The Prisoner') views the life of a famous television personality Gary (Ryan Reynolds) who navely takes on a 'crack' trip that results in a house arrest controlled by a jovial officer Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) and whose only outlet is a neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis) with whom he has a seductive affinity: while both women appear real, events occur that make their existence questionable to the crack-addled Gary. In Part II, 'Reality Television', Gavin (Reynolds) is a television writer attempting to get his pilot film accepted by executive boss Susan (Davis), but falls into troubled times when he is told his best friend Melissa (McCarthy) must be dropped from the project. In Part III, 'Knowing', Gabriel (Reynolds) is a gentle videogame creator, happily married to Mary (McCarthy) with a daughter Noelle (Elle Fanning) who has been weaving in and out of the film as different characters, gets stuck in a forest and in attempting to seek help encounters Sierra (Davis), a strange woman who  finally approaches the possibilities of Gabriel's 'mission on earth'.  The title of the movie becomes apparent when Sierra informs Gabriel that while God is a 10, human beings are only 7s, koala bears are 8s because they control the environment, and Gabriel is a 9 - an extraterrestrial being in a human incarnation to test the goodness of the earth. How this information affects Gabriel and how the story is resolved is yet more of the intellectual exercise and joy of THE NINES.

Ryan Reynolds is extraordinarily fine in his three roles: he is a far better actor than the usual films he makes would indicate.  Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy are as always reliably excellent.  But the magic of this film comes form the mind and direction of John August who thankfully gives the audience much to ponder.  It is a gem of a film.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 08",1201910400,56,2841,4.891666666666667
3271137,4,B000YW8RN6,"NOTE: Some of the reviews here (like the one below by Grady) spoil the movie by basically giving you a plot synopsis, including the epiphany towards the end.  Read some of the reviews here with caution.

John August is someone who impressed me back in 1999 with a witty script for the zany ensemble piece entitled Go.  Directed by a up-and-coming director by the name of Doug Liman (Bourne Identity, Swingers), Go offered a straight-forward story that was constantly twisted due to a change of perspective as we saw the story from different characters.  The way it weaved in and out made the movie a lot more interesting that it probably should have been.

Now, we have The Nines, not only written by John August but also directed by him, and it shares a few similarities with his big debut, Go.  However, it's infinitely more intriguing, intelligent and frustrating than Go could ever be.  The Nines is comprised of three short stories featuring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy and Hope Davis playing different characters.

The first film has Reynolds playing a blockbuster actor who is in house arrest, with McCarthy playing a publicist and Davis the next door neighbor.  As the scenario continues, Reynolds' character becomes convinced the house is haunted.  The second film has Reynolds as an effeminate TV screenwriter who is being followed around by a reality TV camera as they film his progress to make a pilot.  During this, McCarthy plays Reynolds' best friend while Davis is a TV exec.  The final scenario has Reynolds, a high profile video game designer, married to McCarthy.  Their car breaks down in a forest and when Reynolds goes to find help, discovers Davis.

The way the film works is that each episode builds on each other, presenting a different perspective while also sharing common themes.  The way the puzzle pieces fit together and the epiphany towards the end of the film creates a startling new take on the film as a whole.  August does a terrific job of creating common themes and a central thread that goes between each episode and even when it's over and you still aren't quite sure what happened, you never feel cheated.

It's a very heady film that's more intelligent than a lot of films that share similar themes.  While I can't reference the particular films without going into heavy spoiler territory, I will say that The Nines touches on religion, philosophy, technology, reality and how everything intersects.  It also seems intent on discussing life as a whole and the entire concept of creation and creators.  It's no coincidence that all of the scenarios are based on people living a certain kind of reality that is more ""reelity"" than ""reality.""

The weight of the film rests on the shoulders of the terrific cast.  Reynolds, in particular, shows that he's more than Mr. Van Wilder and plays three starkly different characters with aplomb that belies his earlier roots in teen comedy.  This is by far his best role and it was amazing watching him in these three roles.  Meanwhile, The Nines also shares an actress with Go: Melissa McCarthy.  She steals the show and is a ray of light in every scene she's in.  Hope Davis is always enjoyable, and her characters play a very interesting role in the story as a whole, but, for me, McCarthy is tops.

The Nines is a film you'll want to watch with people who you can have an intelligent conversation with.  It's a complicated film that, unlike so many today, doesn't provide you with all the answers.  Even when the resolution occurs, you won't have all the pieces in your hands.  Watching the included short film is as close as you'll come to an answer.  So, the best bet is to watch it with people who will want to talk about it, because The Nines is definitely a talking-about film.

I'd definitely recommend it to fans of metaphysical puzzles and movies that don't provide easy answers.  An intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining film.",1201651200,42,3926,4.794642857142857

3271146,5,B000YW8RN6,"Excellent.  Weird in all the right ways, just a touch creepy, but perfectly so.  Really enjoyed this movie.  There was an author, Terry Pratchett, who once wrote about ""the other pants leg of time"".  In his book _From the Corner of His Eye_ Dean Koontz explores a similar theory beautifully as well.  This movie reminds me of that theory.  It's also going around, to some degree, in the world of physics, part of Chaos and String and a few other theories...But the thought that any decision, no matter how small, is always made, and something in the ""world"" breaks in the process.  There is another place created from that moment, where the other option was taken...or the hundreds of other options were taken.  It is a theory that encompases a thought process wherein there are a million possible universes, living one on top of the other, like layers of an onion.

I love this thought...because in this theory, there is a place, somewhere, somehow, where I got it right.  Where all the forces lined up as they were supposed to, and I managed to find the future that I was meant to be in.  And maybe, through some circuitous route...I can figure out how to make HERE, mesh up with THERE...And it'll all come right in the end.  :)

Lovely movie, well written, well acted.  Definitely worth a viewing.  :)",1465689600,2,1304,4.608695652173913

3271179,4,B000YW8RN6,"You'll find the movies in this collection by Mill Creek to be interesting, if nothing else. There is no running theme behind the four films. Mysteries, riddles & a revenge thriller are whats in store for you here. ""Slipstream"" would be the most interesting just by looking at the cast, and the involvement of Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins wrote, directed and starred in this film. He also plays some piano in the films soundtrack. It's one of three films he's directed over the years, and any movie starring him is worthy of a watch. All of the films in the set are widescreen, and all prints look excellent. Mill Creek has to be commended for continuing to put out a top notch product at an affordable price. I've seen this set at stores for five dollars. It's easily worth a pick up at that price. Here's a synopsis for each film.

The Nines

Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) and Hope Davis (The Weather Man) star in this clever, mind-bending thrill ride through the mind of an actor, a writer and videogame designer who arguably controls them all. The Nines consists of three short films, each featuring the same actors in different - and sometimes overlapping - roles. Together, three stories form a single narrative that explores the relationships between author and character, actor and role, creator and creation. Alternately funny and unsettling, this film is like a riddle where the answer is the question - How does it all add up? 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Slipstream

Written, directed and starring Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins (The Silence Of The Lambs), and featuring a top notch cast, Slipstream is an exciting and inventive drama about life and death and everything in between. Aging screenwriter Felix Bonhoeffer (Hopkins) has lived his life in two states of existence: reality and his own interior world. While working on a murder mystery screenplay. Felix becomes baffled as his characters start appearing in his life, and his life starts slipping into his characters. Soon, he is thrown into a vortex where dreams, time and reality collide in an increasingly whirling slipstream. 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Limbo

In the untamed wilderness along Alaska's coast, feelings and fortunes change as quickly as the tides in this haunting and hypnotic thriller, from critically acclaimed director John Sayles (The Spiderwick Chronicles). Traumatized by a boat accident at sea many years before, Joe Gastineau has given up his hopes for a life beyond the odd jobs he takes to support himself. That quickly changes when Donna DeAngelo, bar singer and nomad, and her troubled teen-age daughter, Noelle, enter Joe's life. Both mother and daughter fall for Joe, increasing the already present friction between them. The tension continues to build when Joe captains his ship on a mysterious sea voyage up the Alaskan coast, only discovering after it's too late that the trip may end up costing them their lives. 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Already Dead

Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard, Super 8) had it all: a beautiful wife, a powerful job, and a beloved son. But when an intruder breaks into his home, kills his son and brutalizes his wife, Archer's ideal life is shattered. When the police fail to find the killer, his therapist (Christopher Plummer, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) directs Archer to a covert agency that specializes in hunting down ruthless criminals. Now, hot on the trail of his son's murderer, Archer faces a decision having devastating consequences in this suspense-filled revenge thriller. 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

I hope Mill Creek Entertainment keeps putting out these 4 movie packs. They're perfect for a rainy weekend, and they're cheaper than going to the theater.",1376006400,,3782,5.116693679092383
3271180,4,B000YW8RN6,"I would recommend the film for fans of Ryan Reynolds.  He is a handsome actor and has great comedic timing.  Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy round out this strange three act film.

At times it is a little hard to follow; but, it really smacks of Outer Limits and Twilight Zone episodes in that you want to know what will happen next.

Strange cerebral aspects of the film are always lurking beneath the plot line that are not fully developed until the end. . . and even then, I'm not sure I totally got it.  But, it definitely kept my interest.

If you like Ryan Reynolds and an odd story line that isn't the usual Hollywood fare, I would highly recommend it.",1375056000,,659,4.360655737704918
3271181,4,B000YW8RN6,"I  finally bought THE NINES, after reading about it on and off for a couple of years, because I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan, and Ryan and THE NINES do not disappoint. Ryan does a very good job, especially as the second character he plays, the TV writer. I was surprised. And the timing, editing, mood, continuity of THE NINES are all very good. The cast is wonderful. Let's see more of everybody involved.
  PS--I live in Hollywood and ran into Ryan Reynolds, walking his dog, in the wild, after this movie was filmed, and, just now, watching THE NINES,I realized that where I met Ryan that day was actually the filming location of the last story. And Ryan looked fabulous, better than in his movies, if that's possible, so was it Ryan or Gabriel that I met that day? Seriously.",1367625600,,776,4.48936170212766

3271184,2,B000YW8RN6,"Maybe I just couldn't get the jest of it all, but it was like a dream sequence back and forth. Left me scratching my head. Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy and Elle Channing added what little light I saw!",1360195200,,203,4.368421052631579

It makes you think. The acting is great in this movie as well. The one woman from Bridesmaids ( Megan) who is played by Melissa McCarthy, really did a great job!

It is one of those movies that take you back and forth from different story lines that you have to pay attention and this particular guy has something to do with the number 9 obviously. You will be shocked at the ending and I think that is why I love to watch the movie over and over. I would recommend it especially if you like the unusual, abstract thinking, suspenseful type of movie, even action, it has all of that in it. Watch it!",1356652800,,579,4.087719298245614

When the movie was over I felt I needed a cigarette(and I don't smoke)lol I loved it! very cerebral!!!!! The actors all gave great performances which is hard to do when u back trac and piece together to make sense of the ride the movie takes you on! I don't give away plots! I am a former film student mother of 8 and a New Dr. of psychiatry. If I can enjoy this sight un seen and love it when it was over then anyone ready to let go and be taken no guided on a intricate journey go for it!!!!!! Ryan is so hotttttttt!!!!

This movie is just random, odd things thrown together.  As other reviewers stated, I nearly turned it off in the first ten minutes because it was so boring, but I thought surely it would get better.  It did not.  There really isn't much of a storyline at all.  That being said, the acting is pretty good.  Ryan Reynolds fans might want to watch this movie for that alone.  I, however, wish I had my time back.",1353715200,,546,4.2745098039215685

3271193,1,B000YW8RN6,"You Hollywood people bend your tiny brains trying to bring meaning to your big big egos. Guess what? We, the everyday unwashed, gun toting, dumbbells who work (if we're very, very lucky these days) very hard to support our families, pay our mortgages and, if we're really lucky, car payments don't give a flip about what you ""think"" is genious writing and film making. We want to leave our mundane existences, buy some popcorn, and have FUN watching great, happy, well-filmed movies. If I could give this idiotic piece of existential garbage a minus 100 and get back that hour and forty or so minutes of my life - THAT would make me happy, too. To Melissa McCarthy and Ryan Reynolds - two actors I used to respect: you are not put before us, the people who ultimately pay you to ""act"" for a so-called living, to waste our valuable time. Yes, we probably live in tinyer houses than you and drive dinkier cars and make tons less money than you, but please remember that some of us actually have brains and aren't dumb. Do not let the immense hubris of Hollywood fool you that we, the little dumb audience cannot end your careers. Movies like this are best left in your in-house movie rooms. The rest of us don't care about garbage like this. We want to be taken away and entertained. That's why they call what you do for a living ""the entertainment industry."" Enough said. At least I hope you all in Hollywood can get your heads out of the clouds long enough to understand the depth of what I'm trying to help you understand.",1348099200,4,1523,4.482014388489208

3271196,4,B000YW8RN6,"I honestly would not have expected a movie of this caliber from Ryan Reynolds. Typically, he's a romantic comedy or action film kind of man. This was deep,it really made one step back to think. It brought into question what reality truly is in the same way that films like The Matrix and Inception did. While the Nines didn't quite reach The Matrix bar, it's definitely worth watching.

As an audience, there were periods of confusion where you were utterly lost as to what was going on, but it wasn't for long and had enough intrigue to keep one hooked.",1325980800,2,554,4.54
3271197,5,B000YW8RN6,"This movie was great.  I enjoy movies such as PI, Donnie Darko, Inception, Never Ending Story, What Dreams May Come, The Machinist, Fight Club, Shutter Island, Last Action Hero, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Stranger Than Fiction, The Matrix, Final Destination, The Butterfly Effect, Jacob's Ladder, In The Mouth Of Madness, The Usual Suspects, The Illusionist, The Prestige, and Source Code.  It is unfortunate that nobody has really come up with a name for this genre, as over the past 10 years, more and more have been produced.

*** SPOILER ALERT! ***

If I were to categorize this movie, I'd say it was a combination of three particular niche genres.  The first I would call something like ""Character self-awareness"" because the character becomes aware that they are somebody else's creation.  The second I would call ""Fiction Invades Reality"" because this is where somehow, a fictional character is allowed to become real and enters the human world.  Last Action Hero is a good example of this type.  And third would be ""World In World"", because you find out there's an alternate universe existing outside of what you believe to be real, like the Matrix.

About 10 years ago, being a programmer myself and being aware of the game called ""The Sims"", it occured to me that maybe what we think of as ""God"" is actually an alien and we are just a SIM's-like game of his creation that he sometimes plays, but other times he just lets alone to evolve as it will.  This movie is the first time that I've seen that idea of mine expressed so clearly, that it feels as though they stole that idea from me psycically just like they stole the design for the transformer ""Hot Rod"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Takara-Masterpiece-Collection-Hot-Rodimus/dp/B00436G1IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Takara Masterpiece Collection Hot Rodimus</a>), who I invented in 1985 when I was 9.

Regardless, if you enjoy *weird"", mindfreak movies that make you think and have to pay attention ... (Maybe ""Puzzle MOvies"" would be a good term??), that are more involved and intricate in it's machinations and plot than a simple mystery, then you might really enjoy this film.  It's not for everybody, but then again, if you are a naturally analytical thinker, then following this movie should be no-sweat.",1325203200,,2344,5.204787234042553

This movie is in three parts ""The Prisoner"", ""Reality Television"", and ""Knowing"". Its almost fitting, because I would recommend watching the original TV series of ""The Prisoner"" with McGoohan.

The stories are interwoven yet independant.

The character Gary/Gavin/Gabriel which start with ""G"" which looks like a 9 upside down. One of the his characters is gay, but not all three.

This movie is an allegory of the personal adventures of the Director himself.

The implications being one of Ego, not Extraterestrials.

This is a psychological film, not sci-fi. And as you can tell from the reviews, people are messed up on their God Concept.

Worth the five stars to see it exposed and in evidence on this review board. Imagine DaVinci's Mona Lisa coming to life and telling DaVinci that his painting skills of her are unflattering and lame.

There is a film short in the DVD that is kind of a pre-quel to this movie. I altered this review to be more to the point. And because I bought the DVD here despite it not noting that.",1272499200,4,1152,4.7537688442211055

3271207,4,B000YW8RN6,"The Nines tells the story of Gary, Gavin, and Gabriel with each character given a specific segment in the film. The first segment tells the story of Gary, an actor who has more than a few issues. The second introduces us to Gavin as we're given a reality TV show look behind the scenes as he tries to get his show onto the air. The final segment is about Gabriel, a married man who designs video games. All of the segments are related and focus around the number 9. Discovering the truth about these characters and what they really are is what really makes the film worth watching.

I had been wanting to see this for awhile and I finally got around to seeing it today. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. I haven't seen a film tie together multiple segments like this in a long time. Everything comes together quite well and it's pretty satisfying once all the cards are put on the table. Ryan Reynolds proves once again that his acting is quite strong and has more to him than being the casual funny man. Melissa McCarthy is also worth mentioning. She starts off being kind of irritating, but turns out being incredibly charming once the credits roll. Hope Davis was the last piece of the puzzle and is crucial to the overall story. At first, she just seems like the typical jealous and conniving female character who didn't get what she wanted. As the film progresses, however, her role becomes more interesting and it's revealed how important she is in Gary/Gavin/Gabriel's path to discovering what's really going on.

The Nines deserves a watch from anyone looking for something a little different. It'll definitely satisfy Ryan Reynolds fans and it'll probably meet or exceed what you expect from the film once it's all said and done. It surprised me quite a bit with a strong story, a great cast, and an incredibly solid script. Give it a watch. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

3271209,4,B000YW8RN6,"Three very talented actors play in three short films that tie into one complex story.  The main male characters in all three movies are played by Ryan Reynolds who gives a very fine performance.  The film gets viewer to observe the characters as they have an all powerful ability to change reality with their own craft.  Actor creates and inhabits the personality traits of the person they are representing; writer uses his imagination and personal experiences to creat a believable story that ordinary people can relate to; video game designer cretaes virtual reality where the outcomes are defined based on his own preferences.  All three seem to be playing God but at the same time all three are incapable of controling their own reality.  Actor is addicted to drugs and alcohol, write is manipulated by the TV executive, while video designer has trouble rescuing his own family while having car trouble.  These men are all powerful but yet vulnerable.  Their stories are connected in a strange way that is similar to the life re-incarnated.

3271210,3,B000YW8RN6,"Not a bad movie.  Not the greatest I have ever seen, but it was a good mystery.  I think a little more detail at the end would have been nice, but other than that I give it a 3 out of five.  I was impressed with the writing, the plot, and the ending.  However I think if you didn't wait around until the end to tie it all together this might have proved to be a very confusing movie that left a lot of people not actually taking the time to finish it.",1213056000,2,451,3.817204301075269

3271214,5,B000YW8RN6,"The Nines is a remarkable film by John August.  He is the genius who wrote the A.D.D./drug addled, raver cult classic Go and Tim Burton's beautiful love story, Big Fish. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds playing three separate, and sometimes overlapping, characters in the three short films that make up this one story.  He blows the top off this movie with his portrayal of a writer, a troubled actor, and a video game designer. This is one of the most original films that I have seen in a long time.  I would have to say that Reynolds has finally broke through as a serious actor and shed the stigma of being another National Lampoons' puppet.  After watching this movie, I had to wonder why he ever did such horrendous trash as Van Wilder. The movie is hard to follow but it pays off.  It's a confusing concept but the director is able to pull everything together solidly by the end of the last short.  I hope this is the new direction that filmmakers are going to take.  Or at least they should.  John August has set a new standard, and it's going to be hard for anyone to keep up with him.
Go BUY this one... NOW!!!!!",1206576000,2,1118,4.367149758454106

If you want mindless, escapism entertainment, this is not the film. However if you want to exercise your brain, this is it. The performances are excellent. Who knew Ryan Reynolds could be that versatile and Melissa McCarthy, is funny, touching and cool in all 3 stories. I'm still trying to figure out what it all means, I have two or three theories, as do my friends.",1205193600,,486,4.597701149425287
3271216,4,B000YW8RN6,"This was a very decent flick. Basically the movie is split into three segments with the same actors playing different roles. The first segment, to be honest, starts of great then gets lame very quickly (there was a musical portion where I almost turned it off). The second story is a little bit better. By the time you get to the last segment the movie obviously takes a turn to a much ""darker"" story. The Nines features an outstanding ending like non other. It was actually kind of touching (did I just say that?). Overall, if it wasn't for the last story, I honestly would have been upset for wasting my time. I stress to you, in the end it all makes sense... I'd pay to see this again, although I might do a little fast-forwarding next time.",1204416000,2,744,4.398550724637682

3271219,4,B000YW8RN6,"An actor has a bad trip after a bad breakup and ends up in house arrest -- but either he is losing his mind or he is not who he thinks he is and things are not what they seem.  This is one of those metaphysical puzzler films, that is fun and engaging at a number of levels but at its deepest has you working out what it all means.  In films like this you think they are going to back down from the broadest ambitions, that it's all going to be a dream or a game and everything will work out so that you can go home happy, since it didn't really mean anything and didn't try to say anything.  Luckily, this film went further than that.  It takes its conceit all the way and leaves you hanging at the end -- asking big philosophical questions like: what does it mean to claim, like Leibniz (as parodied in Voltaire's Candide) that this is the best of all possible worlds?  The film feels like Borges for the youtube generation, and really goes as deep down the rabbit hole as some of the Argentine's best puzzlers.  It's hard to be a lot more specific without spoiling the film.

The performances in the film, especially by the three leads (Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy) are uniformly excellent and surprisingly versatile.  There is nothing terribly unusual or interesting about the look of the film -- stylistically, the film feels a bit like television ... and this may be appropriate since one of the sequences of the film is about a director of a television pilot ... in fact this film feels like it could have been adapted for a television pilot, for a series I would definitely watch -- shades of Twin Peaks but grander in its metaphysical ambitions and humbler in its stylistic excesses.",1202169600,,1710,4.423566878980892
3271220,5,B000YW8RN6,"I rented this movie because I am a huge fan of Go.  The Nines shared a similar style: a few different stories that overlapped.  What made this movie so different than Go, is that the overlapping stories involved the same three actors as different characters so the overlap has to occur more creatively.

The first time I watched this movie, by the time the credits rolled up, my brain felt like it had been flattened, rolled up in a ball, and flattened again.  But in a good way.  I immediately had to watch it again.  Then I got ahold of a copy of the script and read that.  I still haven't returned the rental... I feel the need to watch it one more time... this time with the commentary on.

It is the smartest movie I've seen in a while that isn't trying too hard to be smart.  Some other reviews complained about the musical number.  It was definitely odd at first, but after watching it a second time, I couldn't imagine it without.

Definitely an indie gem.  It will be my first DVD purchase this year.  Speaking of which, the bonus features are better than any I've ever seen.",1202083200,5,1084,4.36
3271221,5,B000YW8RN6,"THE NINES is a film that may seem like a tough story to follow, but the concept and the 'autobiographical' script by the gifted John August are so fine that once seen, this film demands re-visiting.  It is tremendously entertaining, blessed with a superb cast, and offers food for thought far beyond the running time of the film.  For this viewer it falls into the 'brilliant' category.

More of an existential exercise than a traditional movie tale, THE NINES has the courage to challenge our concept of that is the real world, what is fantasy, what exists beyond our concept of our 'space' here on planet Earth, and just how significant is the current obsession with television reality shows and videogames on the way we are stuck in the present.  John August explores these issues by interweaving three stories, using the same actors to change vantages and personalities to raise questions and pose problems for the audience to attempt to resolve.  It works.

Part I ('The Prisoner') views the life of a famous television personality Gary (Ryan Reynolds) who navely takes on a 'crack' trip that results in a house arrest controlled by a jovial officer Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) and whose only outlet is a neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis) with whom he has a seductive affinity: while both women appear real, events occur that make their existence questionable to the crack-addled Gary. In Part II, 'Reality Television', Gavin (Reynolds) is a television writer attempting to get his pilot film accepted by executive boss Susan (Davis), but falls into troubled times when he is told his best friend Melissa (McCarthy) must be dropped from the project. In Part III, 'Knowing', Gabriel (Reynolds) is a gentle videogame creator, happily married to Mary (McCarthy) with a daughter Noelle (Elle Fanning) who has been weaving in and out of the film as different characters, gets stuck in a forest and in attempting to seek help encounters Sierra (Davis), a strange woman who  finally approaches the possibilities of Gabriel's 'mission on earth'.  The title of the movie becomes apparent when Sierra informs Gabriel that while God is a 10, human beings are only 7s, koala bears are 8s because they control the environment, and Gabriel is a 9 - an extraterrestrial being in a human incarnation to test the goodness of the earth. How this information affects Gabriel and how the story is resolved is yet more of the intellectual exercise and joy of THE NINES.

Ryan Reynolds is extraordinarily fine in his three roles: he is a far better actor than the usual films he makes would indicate.  Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy are as always reliably excellent.  But the magic of this film comes form the mind and direction of John August who thankfully gives the audience much to ponder.  It is a gem of a film.  Highly Recommended.
