Option for Japanese with English subtitles, or to watch in English.  I never use the subtitles while I'm watching in English, because they are different than what is being said-which drives me nuts-but the reason for this is because of who was translating.  The translation for the spoken english is more accurate than the translation for the subtitles-for various reasons I won't put here.

But I'll have to wait and see if it has the 14 episodes it says it has because I just noticed that even though box 5 says it has 14, it only has 13 listed on its episode list (that nice little paper inside the boxes that tells you which episode is on which disc).  I haven't actually watched my whole box yet, so I don't know if there are 14 or 13, but the list only lists 13.

But anyways, this box will cover the final rounds of the chunnin exam (starting with the fight between Sasuke and Gaara) which is interrupted when the village is attacked by the sound ninja and the sand ninja.  While the Hokage is locked in battle with Orochimaru, Sasuke takes off after Gaara and the two other sand ninja with him, to stop them from using Gaara as their ultimate weapon in destroying the village.  Naruto, Sakura, and Shikamaru go after Sasuke, trying to reach him in time to save him fromt eh danger he is in.",1197417600,21,2269,4.687657430730479
2992599,5,B000WW1YNS,"Although this series is probably overly prolonged, the writing is good and the animation isn't too rotten for a cheaply produced series.

2992619,3,B000WW1YNS,"Yeah, some funny episodes here, but overall it became clear at the end of season 5 that they found a way to elongate the main plot points up until then since the series was popular, and then they gave us pretty much a ton of garbage in Season 6 and 7. Like I said, some of it is funny, but the way they extended the series is almost as bad as American TV would have done it with a popular show.

2992697,3,B000WW1YNS,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 6 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes sixty-six through seventy-eight of Naruto.  The first and second discs contain four episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 7, which runs four roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode seventy-eight.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to three trailers: Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, and Death Note.  The link labeled as ""Manga"" includes an advertisement for Shonen Jump Magazine, an advertisement for the Naruto manga series, and a couple of advertisements for other Shonen Jump manga titles.

While I'm disappointed in the lack of special features in the set, I knew to expect it after seeing the previous five DVD box sets.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 6 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1268697600,2,1429,4.672

2992699,5,B000WW1YNS,"After seeing this volume of Naruto and seeing Gaara's true form.  I would be very inclined to leave this guy the hell alone if at all possible.  Anyone that claims their only purpose in life or sense of fulfillment is to kill.  They need a WHOLE lot of alone time and a nice little spot in hell all by themselves.  Gaara's gone through some major trauma in his childhood and while i feel for him.  He has an evil sand spirit inside of him that will eventually take him over.  He was shunned and belittled all the time when he was a little kid.

Yes it sucks and its sad, but others have gone through that in the show like (Naruto) for example and has the Nine Tail Fox spirit inside of him and went through the same stuff.  The difference being he knows that with his friends and loved ones he can and will accomplish almost anything he wants.  You aren't stronger by yourself or just caring for yourself and no one else thats a lonely way of life that Gaara clings to.  He soon finds out that through those friends that he will never.  That they give you something more to fight for which makes you more powerful than he could ever dream of.

With that being said him and Sasuke have their day of battle at the Exam but it is put on hold after the Hidden Leaf village is attacked in a well coordinated and planned move by Orochimaru (former student) to the current Hokage.  Who's just as wacked out on crazy as Gaara plus a little bit more (experimenting on people even your own).  Hokage is kidnapped by him and they are in their battle for their very lives.  Several other battles are taking place between other students in the Exam as well.  Plus a well times reentry by everyone's favorite ""Pervy Sage"" as Naruto so nicely puts it as well.

It makes for one excellent Volume 6 of this popular and still growing Anime series.  Naruto is something that anyone can pretty much get into and while it looks mild in action.  It isn't really something for kids to be watching unless your watching the version of it on Cartoon Network which is pretty mild.  While compared to this Uncut version at least.

I look forward to the next volume as Naruto steps in when Sasuke is running on empty and Sakura is in danger (again..:).  He faces off with Gaara and shows more promise than anyone ever thought he could possibly have.

It's a series that needs to be looked at from the beginning and believe it.  You'll get into it like so many others already have.",1214006400,,2451,4.348017621145375
2992700,3,B000WW1YNS,"I've loved the Naruto series up until this point in Volume 6.  The constant repeats of scenes from previous episodes get a bit excessive and the non-stop chatter between characters doing the same exact thing several minutes ago (aka the Third Hokage is pulling out Orochimaru's soul scene).  I wished the dvds had the option of removing the annoying ""extra"" scenes and stick with the manga-style storyline.  Because of this, Naruto episodes are beginning to become Dragon Ball Z episodes where we're blasted with Gohan and the others screaming at the top of their lungs for the entire episode that is absolutely pointless and annoying.",1212364800,2,635,5.0285714285714285

2992709,5,B000WW1YNS,"Fist some info about the naruto series
At this moment the series on Japanese television is at episode 260
This box will cover late 60's till 70's eps, so a very long way to go
Only buy this if yr willing to buy everything, cuz every ep is connected, mis 1 and yr lost

It's called the uncut version
Wich means it has the uncut japanese audio with english subs
Like what previous review says the english audio and subs don't match, That is cuz the japanese and english don't match
The series translators for us tv have been overly creative and just made alot up, that never was said or done in the japanese version
Needless to say the Japanese version is the best version

This series is worth paying for, but before you buy consider that you'll be stuck to buying the uncut boxsets for the next 5 years at least",1198972800,3,811,4.294117647058823

Option for Japanese with English subtitles, or to watch in English.  I never use the subtitles while I'm watching in English, because they are different than what is being said-which drives me nuts-but the reason for this is because of who was translating.  The translation for the spoken english is more accurate than the translation for the subtitles-for various reasons I won't put here.

But I'll have to wait and see if it has the 14 episodes it says it has because I just noticed that even though box 5 says it has 14, it only has 13 listed on its episode list (that nice little paper inside the boxes that tells you which episode is on which disc).  I haven't actually watched my whole box yet, so I don't know if there are 14 or 13, but the list only lists 13.

But anyways, this box will cover the final rounds of the chunnin exam (starting with the fight between Sasuke and Gaara) which is interrupted when the village is attacked by the sound ninja and the sand ninja.  While the Hokage is locked in battle with Orochimaru, Sasuke takes off after Gaara and the two other sand ninja with him, to stop them from using Gaara as their ultimate weapon in destroying the village.  Naruto, Sakura, and Shikamaru go after Sasuke, trying to reach him in time to save him fromt eh danger he is in.",1197417600,21,2269,4.687657430730479

3227194,3,B000WW1YNS,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 6 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes sixty-six through seventy-eight of Naruto.  The first and second discs contain four episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 7, which runs four roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode seventy-eight.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to three trailers: Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, and Death Note.  The link labeled as ""Manga"" includes an advertisement for Shonen Jump Magazine, an advertisement for the Naruto manga series, and a couple of advertisements for other Shonen Jump manga titles.

While I'm disappointed in the lack of special features in the set, I knew to expect it after seeing the previous five DVD box sets.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 6 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1268697600,2,1429,4.672

3227196,5,B000WW1YNS,"After seeing this volume of Naruto and seeing Gaara's true form.  I would be very inclined to leave this guy the hell alone if at all possible.  Anyone that claims their only purpose in life or sense of fulfillment is to kill.  They need a WHOLE lot of alone time and a nice little spot in hell all by themselves.  Gaara's gone through some major trauma in his childhood and while i feel for him.  He has an evil sand spirit inside of him that will eventually take him over.  He was shunned and belittled all the time when he was a little kid.

Yes it sucks and its sad, but others have gone through that in the show like (Naruto) for example and has the Nine Tail Fox spirit inside of him and went through the same stuff.  The difference being he knows that with his friends and loved ones he can and will accomplish almost anything he wants.  You aren't stronger by yourself or just caring for yourself and no one else thats a lonely way of life that Gaara clings to.  He soon finds out that through those friends that he will never.  That they give you something more to fight for which makes you more powerful than he could ever dream of.

With that being said him and Sasuke have their day of battle at the Exam but it is put on hold after the Hidden Leaf village is attacked in a well coordinated and planned move by Orochimaru (former student) to the current Hokage.  Who's just as wacked out on crazy as Gaara plus a little bit more (experimenting on people even your own).  Hokage is kidnapped by him and they are in their battle for their very lives.  Several other battles are taking place between other students in the Exam as well.  Plus a well times reentry by everyone's favorite ""Pervy Sage"" as Naruto so nicely puts it as well.

It makes for one excellent Volume 6 of this popular and still growing Anime series.  Naruto is something that anyone can pretty much get into and while it looks mild in action.  It isn't really something for kids to be watching unless your watching the version of it on Cartoon Network which is pretty mild.  While compared to this Uncut version at least.

I look forward to the next volume as Naruto steps in when Sasuke is running on empty and Sakura is in danger (again..:).  He faces off with Gaara and shows more promise than anyone ever thought he could possibly have.

It's a series that needs to be looked at from the beginning and believe it.  You'll get into it like so many others already have.",1214006400,,2451,4.348017621145375
3227197,3,B000WW1YNS,"I've loved the Naruto series up until this point in Volume 6.  The constant repeats of scenes from previous episodes get a bit excessive and the non-stop chatter between characters doing the same exact thing several minutes ago (aka the Third Hokage is pulling out Orochimaru's soul scene).  I wished the dvds had the option of removing the annoying ""extra"" scenes and stick with the manga-style storyline.  Because of this, Naruto episodes are beginning to become Dragon Ball Z episodes where we're blasted with Gohan and the others screaming at the top of their lungs for the entire episode that is absolutely pointless and annoying.",1212364800,2,635,5.0285714285714285

3227206,5,B000WW1YNS,"Fist some info about the naruto series
At this moment the series on Japanese television is at episode 260
This box will cover late 60's till 70's eps, so a very long way to go
Only buy this if yr willing to buy everything, cuz every ep is connected, mis 1 and yr lost

It's called the uncut version
Wich means it has the uncut japanese audio with english subs
Like what previous review says the english audio and subs don't match, That is cuz the japanese and english don't match
The series translators for us tv have been overly creative and just made alot up, that never was said or done in the japanese version
Needless to say the Japanese version is the best version

This series is worth paying for, but before you buy consider that you'll be stuck to buying the uncut boxsets for the next 5 years at least",1198972800,3,811,4.294117647058823
