8356728,2,B0028RXZFU,"This item was a huge disappointment. The film is an accurate, one-of-kind narrative documentary about what was routine air operations for the fighter arm of the 8th Army Air Force based in England during World War II.  HOWEVER, I had expected to get the original 1944 release narrated by then-Army Captain Ronald Reagan; instead I got a second-rate re-dub or re-release of the war-time film narrated by some anonymous actor with a voice full of whimsy who sounds like he should be pitching Armour Hotdogs during the Gumby show.  It may seem ridiculous but the demeanor of this laughable narrator completely fails in delivering the gravity and urgence of the subject, thereby destroying the power of the film.  This DVD version (which uses the same verbatim script) is an insult, compared to Ronald Reagan's genuine, truly reverent voice performance in this story of the exploits and sacrifices of the 8th Fighter Command during its victorious campaign against German air power in the skies over Europe.

Hold off on this DVD and get the VHS tape with Reagan - his performance is absolutely superb, on the mark in tone and temperament - an honest reflection both of his own patriotic spirit and of the spirit of those rapidly fading great men of the Greatest Generation who flew and fought and won the world's greatest and most relentless air war.",1333843200,,1346,4.890350877192983
