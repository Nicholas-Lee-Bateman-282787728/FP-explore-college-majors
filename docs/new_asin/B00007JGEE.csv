7977331,1,B00007JGEE,"Negatively - 5 Stars Just get the ""Mortal Kombat : Conquest Volume Complete Series""

I mean really after fidgeting few times to get the Disc to Work in my DVD Player

""Hey ----- IT"" Combine Episodes and ""ADD DIGITALLY"" Actors Names! Make A Movie that is not really a ""Movie""
A bunch of Episodes smash together in a ""Blending"" Trick by ""Movie"" makers with the right equipment. Like Fade into another episode before you actually see the Credits.

Again Buy ""Mortal Kombat : Conquest Volume Complete Series""

You'll Understand...Oh, my TV is not ""Black & White"" by the way...or should I say ""Greenish Grey""

Pull It off Shelves.

I mean really...I Just like Mortal Kombat...Played The Game Great with ""Non American"" Style Fighting...
Like Seeing a 'white guy' ""play like the Japanese."" Straight Up. Not Recent years...but still like Martial Arts.",1519776000,,843,4.943262411347518
