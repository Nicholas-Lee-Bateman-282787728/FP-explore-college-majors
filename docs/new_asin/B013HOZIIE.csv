8727707,5,B013HOZIIE,"At 65 miles per hour it will take some 6,206 years to get to frozen Pluto, some three billion miles away and NASA did it in only 10 years. What is important is to realize that the technology that we have now did not exist 10 years ago but more importantly nothing close to what we have now when NASA started planning a trip to Pluto. For NEW HORIZON to capture images of Pluto as it comes to focus was the dream of many dedicated scientists who convinced US to put up the money and although a project like NEW HORIZON needs many geniuses to achieve its goal, we need to be thankful to self educated farm boy, Clyde Tombaugh who discovered Pluto on March 14, 1930. Discovery for Clyde meant free schooling since he had no money to attend school. An average radio station on earth uses 50,000 watts to transmit a signal. The space craft uses only 10; yes only ten watts to require a signal pick up on earth. That amazing technology comes with education. Education is such an important part of a society and the shameful part of the whole equation is that as intelligent as Americans are, it seems they will never find a solution to the failing corrupt school system in New Jersey and many other states in the Union.",1442793600,8,1213,4.371681415929204
