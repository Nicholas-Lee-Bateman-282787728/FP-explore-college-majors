7918556,5,B00003E4E4,Amazing that this has not come out on DVD. If you grew up near the park this will bring back fond memories. I was fascinated with the park's history. Great news reels and one very funny silent comedy shot on location when the park was just a park are included at the end of the documentary. And Ken Burns...need I say more? Buy this!,1375142400,,333,4.21875
