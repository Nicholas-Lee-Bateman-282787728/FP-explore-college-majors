My mother read every book she could find about protestant theology and we talked about those books as well as the books I was reading by nonbelievers like Bertrand Russell, Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. Like Elaine Pagels, she was not dogmatic. Men run the real world and women can not afford to lay down the laws. The Roman Catholic Church is the prime example of this truth, where men have all the power and the nuns are powerless. The protestants are not much better. I am not a Christian, but I admire theologians like Elaine Pagels, I put my faith in science.",1387238400,,741,4.496296296296296
