Guidry and Torrez both pitched great games, it would have been good to see that, not just the innings where a team scored or threatened to score. First time I've ever seen this game other that Bucky's home run in highlight's, so I gave it four stars because it is a great game, but seeing the whole game would have been five stars. Still, worth the money that I paid for it, great keepsake for this Yankee fan!!",1456790400,,579,4.37037037037037
