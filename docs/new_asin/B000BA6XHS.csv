8084021,2,B000BA6XHS,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a cardboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""Hunting Grounds"" (original title: Catch 'Em If You Can) and ""The Legend of the White Lion"" (original title: Journey into Time). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack.",1132876800,4,723,4.746031746031746
