582099,5,6303155030,This is just the cutest movie.  All I have to say is I want my yellow dress and everybody knows what's on now!!!,1232150400,2,112,3.869565217391304
582100,5,6303155030,"I seen this movie when I was younger, and it has been my favorite movie ever sense. I was 7 when it came out, and I've loved it for 13 years now! Reciently, I've searched all over my tricounty area and have not been able to find this DVD or move anywhere, but I found BOTH on here, and I bought both. I'm every happy and excited. good movie. period.",1198281600,3,349,4.0
582101,1,6303155030,"Yuch!  What a waste!  The kid in this movie is truly obnoxious with a capital ""O"".  The press said she's five, but she plays as an adult teenage type of precocious brat who really irritated.  She looked like a teenager with a small body.  The whole movie seemed slightly disconnected, as if it couldn't make up its mind where it was going.  This was supposed to have been a musical, but they cut all the songs out.  Maybe that's why it seems so choppy.  Nobody seems to know who they really are.  And Nolte looked strange.  Maybe he'd had some work done on his face.  He was somewhat too old for this part.  Albert Brooks gruffed up his voice for his role, which didn't sound right.  The two female leads were just plain quirky.  One of the worst movies that I saw from '94.  And the clothes they put on the kid - looked like Jim Henson dressed her, hair and all.  Too bad.  This is a good cast, lost in a bad script.  James Brooks, who also directed the fabulous ""Broadcast News"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" sure had a bad day here.",1142899200,3,1031,4.253886010362694
582102,5,6303155030,I don't know why some people dislike this movie but I just love it. My Mom & I have been watching this movie since it came out on VHS. It has great scenes and the little girl is so adorable and bratty all at the same time. If you haven't seen this movie rent it and give it a chance.,1131062400,9,283,3.7333333333333334
582103,5,6303155030,"Very entertaining not knowing what the next moment held. Matt deserved what he got, not knowing his daughter. Jeanne! A great performance and all from a small package. So much talent displayed. A wonderful cast.  I absolutely LOVED IT.",1042416000,5,235,5.0256410256410255
582104,5,6303155030,"I'LL DO ANYTHING showed me that Nolte is a good actor. As soon as I realized he was doing a dandy job acting his role--luckless actor--the movie carried on quite well without my analysis.  Nolte has been swirling in the Hollywood maelstrom.  His life has been designed to believe that acting is the most important matter in the world. Then,as often they do, the  vissicitudes of life dump his 5 year old, hard-to-handle,  daughter into the scenery. She is a precocious stick of dynamite. The story takes a few swipes at the cheapside of Hollywood. Otherwise, it is no expose. It is full of fun and healthy laughter.",1018483200,12,615,4.666666666666667
582105,5,6303155030,"Originally shot as a musical with songs by Sinead O'Connor and Prince, this remarkable pic tested so badly in pre-release that they excised ALL  the songs and dance numbers. You'd never miss em'. Nick Nolte is an earnest  actor struggling to make it in L.A. when his ex-wife drops the bombshell  that their five year-old daughter (who Nolte barely knows) will now be  coming to live with him. You thought that kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" was  good? Wait til' you see THIS little spitfire! Julie Kavner is amazing as  the head of a test-screening/marketing company, who spews truth (and  uncanny insights) like bullets from an AK-47. The real draw here though, is  the rocky and tender relationship that develops between Nolte and his young  daughter, against the backdrop of a gutless and brainless movie business.",967939200,17,813,4.919117647058823
582106,2,6303155030,"I like Nick Nolte. The only reason why I saw this movie is because of him. However, I have to say that this is the worst acting I have ever seen from his any other movies. Very often, it was awkard and unnatural. Another  problem is other supporting actresses and actors. They don't act like real.  They acted like they were just out  from acting school. The whole plot is  not really well coordinated (I won't say anything about it, since it is  going to be a spoiler). The movie was  boring to watch. If there is a  reason why I hung  on till the end, it was just to see how it ended (and  the thought that I paid money for this movie). As a plus, you can somehow  get  some slightest idea of what is going on behind making movies  (selection of actors/acresses/kids). There a few nice phrases which come  out of Nolte.  If you are a big Nolte fan, and want to see above plus  things, you may want to see this movie. Otherwise, this movie is boring big  time.",953424000,4,961,4.169398907103825
582107,4,6303155030,"You have to be in the right mood to see this story of a down and out Oscar nominee who has principles.  He also has trouble raising his daughter. You'll like it if: 1. You want to see a film that was a musical --and they  took out the music(no kidding); 2.  You can weed through all the characters  you hate until they mellow out; and 3.  You want to see some great acting  by Nick Nolte, the only one you really like.  There is a scene when  Nolte bursts forth with what acting is all about. You want to stand up and  cheer.",952905600,7,525,3.9711538461538463

582181,3,6303155030,"The five star rating system constantly cramps my style, and as a result, I can't properly score things the way I want.  This is a pretty good movie, and I'd be willing to see it again, as opposed to other pretty good movies that I'll likely never see again, but I can't score the movie properly to reflect that.

Anyways, I saw this on TV maybe 15 years ago.  Cute little girl.  Love her silly singing, as did the producers apparently, who repeated one of her songs after the credits.  Too bad that movies like this aren't offered on instant video; I had to buy the DVD to watch it again.",1388275200,,588,4.261261261261262
582182,5,6303155030,"I absolutely love this movie, the little girl is a very good actress :) my 7 years old daughter likes watching the movie and often picks out her favorite scenes. The only disadvantage about the movie is that the little girl can be obnoxious at times and my daughter is mimicking her, but other than that this was a great movie and recommend it for all ages.",1362960000,,357,4.343283582089552

582185,4,6303155030,"Nolte holds his own with his co-starring comedy specialists in yet another version of the old story of a father suddenly having his girl-child thrust upon him by his ex-wife. Albert Brooks gives himself the material to hold his own with Nolte's character on the laugh front, with Kavner as his vis-a-vis, showing herself, once more, as a most adept comedy actress. Thanks to Brooks, what could have been a cloying child performer is given the material to be center-stage but not cutesy. All in all, the kind of light comedy, which provides a light, spirit-raising, experience.",1323129600,,576,4.948453608247423

582187,1,6303155030,I don't know how to get a hold of the seller from who I bought this DVD from.  The movie won't play right because the word screech and they are way ahead of the actors. It also skips. I would like it replaced as I just love this movie and so do my kids!,1294099200,,253,3.685185185185185
