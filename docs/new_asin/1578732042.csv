7995919,5,1578732042,"Ramtha is said to be a a 35,000 year old warrior that is channeled by JZ Knight.  Whether or not you believe in this sort of thing, the message that comes through is one of empowerment for all.  Ramtha's teachings are that of self awareness and the conquering of all of our individual fears that bind and hold us back from true happiness.

The DVD itself is taken from Knights seminars and lectures from the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, during which she channels the entire program.  It is theatrical and memorizing when you tune into the core message.  The production quality is good and the seminar is lengthy so it is worth checking out.  If you are into spirituality that has a base in quantum physics and you enjoy theatrical presentations then you will enjoy this DVD and the message that comes forth. I give this DVD 5 stars based on content and message.
