7793786,5,0965286819,Good technique review with excellent building exercises for the beginning tumbler. Every beginner should review this video before starting to compete.,1026086400,4,150,6.190476190476191
7793787,4,0965286819,"Coach Wayne takes the back handspring and simply breaks it down into progressions. The exercises are simple to follow and there are closeups so you can really get the technique. This is a great video to break through any fear you may have of performing the skill. Coach Wayne also leads you through some fun conditioning, too. The quality of the video and the music are quite cheesy, but if you can get past it you'll be on your way to effectively learning the back handspring.",1018656000,5,477,4.558139534883721
7793788,5,0965286819,Coach Wayne has what it takes to get vital points across in a fun yet  serious manner.  This tape is like having a whole set of tapes on one  subject by using the day-to-day approach.  We'll be the first to have the  next Coach Wayne gynnastical production when available!
