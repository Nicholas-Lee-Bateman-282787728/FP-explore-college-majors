2436584,1,B000BQ5J8G,"The ""bloody handprint"" poster caused a controversy in the U.K., apparently because the London Underground was displeased with the image it gave them.

But that minor controversy is probably the only reason people went to see ""Creep,"" a cliched by-the-numbers horror flick. Christoper Smith is obviously in over his head, and tries to compensate with lots of sewage and gore.

Kate (Franka Potente) is some sort of German media fashionista at a London party; she leaves pretty quickly for some other event, in hopes of snagging George Clooney. But while waiting for the train to arrive, she falls asleep on the platform. When she wakes, she jumps onto a mystery train -- and is nearly raped by a slimy coworker (Jeremy Sheffield) -- who is promptly attacked by an unseen creature. Not a person, a creature.

It turns out to be the Creep, a pasty-skinned monster who shrieks unintelligibly as it attacks. Imagine Gollum, but less appealing. Now Kate is running for her life in the tunnels and sewers of the London Underground, with homeless junkies as her only allies. But will any of them find their way back out of the tunnels, before the Creep gets them?

Who knew a movie with a killer mutant could be so tedious?

Don't expect ""Creep"" to shock you with its unexpected twists, or give new life to old ""scream movie"" chestnuts. This is a paint-by-numbers splatter movie, without a moment of originality or sympathy.  This is also writer/director Christopher Smith's first foray into a full-length film. And it shows. He's obviously out of his depth.

After forty-five minutes of strained witticisms and suspense, Smith apparently can't think of anything more. So he abandons suspense in favor of flying guts, gore, and dozens of rats. It's not shocking or even unusually disgusting. It feels like a halfhearted distraction, so we won't notice the paper-thin plot.

The worst thing is, the DVD extras reveal that the film once had character development, and a background for the Creep.... but it was completely cut out, apparently in an effort to not make us like the Creep better than Kate. When did lame characters and shallow storylines become a virtue?

Franka Potente, who has made a career out of shrieking and running, is another weakness. Kate is whiny, nasty, selfish and not terribly bright. Since Potente apparently can't make her sympathetic, you may actually find yourself rooting for the Creep. The various victims are similarly obnoxious; the exception is the homeless pair, who are in too little of the film to redeem it, but who come across as being a lot more human than Kate ever does.

If ""Creep"" has been made as a satire, it could have been brilliant. But instead, Smith's full-length debut is the sort of cheeze horror that is usually relegated to two-dollar discount bins.",1130112000,16,2796,4.904661016949152

2436608,4,B000BQ5J8G,"Creep (Christopher Smith, 2004)

I keep reviewing Christopher Smith movies, and I keep reviewing them favorably, though it has always seemed to me that just under the surface there's a truly great filmmaker straining to get out, while Smith's current output still ranges from good to firm. Creep, his debut feature, is ironically the last of the four he has directed at the time of this writing (April 2013) that I've sat down and watched. And of the four, Creep may be the one that comes closest to greatness, though Black Death did give it a run for its money.

Creep is the story of Kate (Lola Rennt's Franka Potente), a bored partygoer in London who heads off to another party via the subwaybut falls asleep on the platform on the way to party #2, waking up only after the station has been shut down for the night. She meets a few of the station's otherwise-homeless denizens and fights off another alumnus of the party she'd just come from (The Children's Jeremy Sheffield) (and here's plot hole #1would this guy, drunk and drugged up, have really hung around the platform that long waiting for her to wake up, or would he have just taken advantage of the situation when she passed out?) before things get really interesting. And by interesting I mean people start dying and once again Franka Potente finds herself running for her life in a movie.

It all sounds like it's been done before. And trust me, it has, but as I have said a number of times before, Smith's specialty is taking tired plots and giving them legs. It helps that Smith, here, also assembled a monster cast, including Paul Rattray (Max), the late Ken Campbell (A Fish Called Wanda), Vas Blackwood (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels), Kelly Scott (Atonement), and Sean Harris (The Discovery of Heaven) in principal roles. Some were already established and some were on their way upthe casting of Harris was especially prescient, it turns outbut all bring their A games to the table, which is part of what makes this flick so much fun to watch. The other part is seeing all these pieces we've seen dozens of times before (and many times sinceI'm convinced that both the filmmakers on the Canadian flick End of the Line and the game designers for Hellgate: London are both huge group fans of Creep) put together in interesting, if not unique, ways.  (Smith seems to have honed that part of his craft as he went along.) It's nothing you haven't seen before, but I had a fun time with it; monster-movie fans could do a lot worse than checking this one out. *** ",1383955200,,2534,4.622222222222222

2436612,5,B000BQ5J8G,"A hell of a ride!!...... We haven't got  a good horror film like this in a long time!.... This movie has everything a good old 80's horror flick would have and more! It also  makes a refreshing  return to the Italian genre, even though director Christopher Smith is British, I'm sure we went to the same school in terms of good horror and im certain that any fans of Bava or Argento would agree on this one. The tone is serious, macabre and as creepy as the freak in the movie is.

That freak By the way (or should we call him by his name, Craig), is definitely MY personal favourite freak from the 2000's. In the last 10 years I haven't seen  any other monsters or creeps that were as  ugly, disgusting, dirty, original and creepy as he was  and I've watched a lot of horror movies....not only they did a hell of a job with him but i believe they also went to the extreme with his actions and his behaviour. I think poor Craig wanted to be a doctor you know....routine check ups...abortions...lol...

Kate (Franka Potente) is trying to get to a party but just learned that her ride left without her. She then tries to catch a taxi  but with no success. Her last option seems to be the train. After arriving at the station she falls asleep. When she wakes up she finds out she's alone and the whole station has been locked for the rest of the night..(That's where the ride begins...). A little later another train arrives and she boards it but its completely empty. The train then stops abruptly leaving kate alone. She then tries to knock at the driver's door but there is no answer......nothing........(enough said)...the rest is for you only!!

From this point in the movie, we are in for a very intense and creepy ride!  Franka is a really good actress and did a good job with the character of Kate, her acting is perfect and she does this very naturally. The cinematography deserves a big 5 stars as well, the use of lights and the colors in the station reminded me of Dario Argento's style, the quality of the picture is superior to lots of movies that  came out in the last 2-3 years! And that use of dark green tint in the more darker scenes like in the creep's food storage room with all those cages  is just pure perfection!!..Miles ahead in terms of picture quality!!

This movie definitely deserves to be seen, i don't think any  real  horror fans would like to miss this one. Should make you go through a whole set of emotions;  you'll laugh, you'll be scared, disgusted and you should even be excited near the end!....oh and ladies, maybe it would be time to consider an annual exam with Dr Craig....he seems to be such an attentionate doctor....and he's clean too!...lol.....just kidding.........i heard he only does abortions.........ha!

2436613,2,B000BQ5J8G,"I got to be honest, this film is just another mediocre though competent torture/slasher film with a deformed antagonist, except he lives in London's sub-way, not in the woods by the lake, in your dreams, or busted out of the insane asylum. That is why I forgot I had it.

The director (did a little research) got the idea for this film from ""An American Werewolf in London"" subway scene, which just by it's self is totally superior to this film.

I'd be interested in his other films, but this one is a rental only.

2436614,3,B000BQ5J8G,"While this creepy British tale is no classic, the creature and the suspense manage to make it a notch better than the standard fare. Of course it contains preposterous plot elements like the fact that this creature would have been captured on tape since the subways are monitored with security cameras, but if you're like I was-- merely looking for a bloody romp late one sleepless night, then this is quite satisfying.

The gory scenes range from good to great, the creature is grotesque and the acting is average-- actually the two homeless people who help the main character were quite memorable. The plot revolves around a stuck-up German gal (with an accent that is mostly American, but sometimes comes out as English which I suppose is acceptable since she's living in London) who is invited to a party that George Clooney is attending and her goal is to try and seduce him. While she misses her ride, she decides to take the subways and ends up falling asleep on the bench while waiting for the last train. She is then trapped inside overnight and that is when the ""things that go bump in the night"" stuff starts happening.

The atmosphere is dark with its labyrinth-like feel-- subway tunnels make for a good setting, imo.

Well, there you have it, the bottom line. Horror fans will likely find elements that fulfill their blood-lust cravings but will not go ga-ga over it.",1307750400,,1381,4.721991701244813

When he targets Kate, who is trapped in the Tube after missing the last train, she must journey through his world in order to escape and return to her own. With interesting visuals and a window on the eerie world of the Underground, this could have been a really great movie. But the plot is thin--pretty much, it boils down to ""escape the creep,"" without much character development or twists.

It would have been better if there was a confrontation that lasted more than a few moments.  I didn't quite understand the importance of the rats which appeared frequently in the movie.  It would have been nice to know about the Creep's background.  One part has a room with some baby cribs and also a photo of a younger version of him near a doctor.  Yet, the viewer is never given much more information about him aside from his name being Craig.  If the directed wanted the audience to feel some sympathy for Creep a bit of info for the audience to know him might have helped.  Was Craig sort of like the creatures in The Descent???  That he got that way because he lived underground??  In the room there was more than one crib so did Creep have siblings??

Man, when you have the opportunity to completely take out the monster/enemy, you don't just give it a little whack then half-heartedly limp along, you make sure that thing can never get up and come after you again!

2436620,4,B000BQ5J8G,"I watched ""Creep"" on Fearnet and was pleasantly surprised.
It's a fast paced horror /thriller about a woman who falls asleep waiting for the last train in a subway hoping to meet George Clooney at a party,needless to say she doesn't make it to the party and what lies ahead of her is no party either.

Waking up and realizing she is locked in the subway station she starts trying to find someone to help her. First she finds a co worker who followed her into the subway with less than friendly ideas for her and proceeds to try and rape her. Good news, he doesn't get to finish ,bad news,it's because he gets attacked by a creature that looks like a combination of the creature from ""Castle Freak"" and the creatures from ""The Descent"" in other words UGLY~!

From there it becomes a cat and mouse roller coaster ride of a horror/slasher flick.
There are a couple of unanswered questions as to the origin of the creature because they show a room with deformed babies in jars and cribs with names on them. It looks like some sort of doctors office..but there is no explanation given,even though they don't explain the origin of the room it's very interesting and towards the end of the film she uses what she saw in the room to her advantage and we get to use our own imagination and make our own conclusion.

I call him a creature but he's more human than anything else,just looks like he has been through some very unfortunate events in his life deformity being key .The blood and gore are very well done and pretty abundant. I am surprised I have never heard OF OR seen this film before.

The director did an amazing job at hiding the fact that they were working with a very small amount of money. All of the acting was wonderful, lots of blood, the ""Creep"" was made tremendously scary, the music was eerie, they created a tense enough atmosphere that behind every wall there could be something hurendous lurking. This horror slasher is an intense on the edge of your seat thriller. Unlike alot of other slashers, this one is far from cheesy.

 The main character Kate becomes stuck in a train station underneath the london bridge, only to find she is not alone. Caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse is a woman trying to escape from a hideous mutated villian.

Also the scene in the cages.  Yuck!!!One thing I liked about this film was that there were some genuine characters in the movie, not just caricatures or a bunch of stereotypes.

2436632,3,B000BQ5J8G,"I was anxious to watch Creep because I do not get to see many British horror films. I had read mixed reviews online, but I had high hopes for this one. It wasn't the high expectations however, that made things difficult for Creep.

The overall premise of the film could potentially be very, very good--perhaps the best in quite some time--being trapped in the Underground after hours, without chance of escape until morning. But, for being trapped after hours, there were too many characters involved. That effectively destroys the feeling of being isolated.

Unfortunately, the Creep looked and sounded like something out of a Rob Zombie flick. In otherwords, it didn't look very real or believable. On the other hand, there is good reason the history of this monster-like being wasn't overly developed--to keep viewer sympathy minimal--and I think that is important. As in science fiction, you cannot answer every question for your audience. In a sense, you can only facilitate.

I felt that too much light was used throughout the movie. For one, you're underground, for god's sake--let there be darkness. Second, and generally speaking, less lighting would have made the film creepier. For instance, it could have helped make the Creep more mysterious and spooky. Instead, the viewer is presented a full, well-lit view of the Creep early on. In this viewer's opinion, that hurt the over all effectiveness of the film.

There are a few scenes that I thought were rather odd--the operation room and the water cages for example. But, the ending is something that the director put a lot of thought into, and I do appreciate that. He did not want it to be the typical horror flick ending. I especially liked the irony of the last scene--the encounter with morning commuters.

I must add that I like Franka Potente, but wouldn't say this is her best performance. I would like to see her do more horror, though (Side note: I couldn't stand the dye job in this film).

All in all, I'd say Creep is a decent attempt at making a horror film. Judging by the interviews on the dvd, the director did put a lot of thought into this film, but that may have taken him too far away from what really sends chills down the viewer's spine.",1184803200,,2222,4.758441558441558

I suggest watching the alternate beginning which was a helpful backstory of the film but was unfortunately left out. It would have filled in some of the plot holes. If you are a horror fan like me then you will probably rent it anyway out of curiosity but you are probably better off watching it when it comes to the sci fi channel.",1165363200,3,664,4.450819672131147

At first I thought the film might be boring because Kate, and only Kate was trapped. I was wrong. The film has plenty of other characters to keep it fresh, and the film never became boring.

The movie is very fun to watch and isn't, by any means, a typical horror film. You will remember the killer, and the setting. The setting is very immersive, and you find yourself sucked into the story very quickly.

The acting in Creep is very, very good. Vas Blackwood puts in a very good support role. There wasn't an over-actor to be found. The dialog didn't come off at any time as forced or phony, as happens quite often in horror films.

Overall, there really were no cliches to be found. Creep is fresh, and for fans of horror it is a must see. For those seeking a good, creepy, horror movie that is a cut above, Creep will satisfy because of its good action, pacing and story.

There are only a couple of times  in the film where I scratched my head saying, could that really happen. These moments were few and far between, but annoying none the less.

Another nit pick I had with the film is that it could have been a bit more suspenseful at times. I didn't end the film and check all the doors in the house. Despite being a good film, Creep wasn't creepy enough for my blood.

The DVD packs a lot of interesting features which, unlike many DVDs, are fun to watch for fans of the movie.

Watch it, rent it, and you might even buy it. Creep is not a perfect film, but it is very good, very unique, and a film that many will remember.

Despite the mixed reviews below, I thoroughly enjoyed Creep.

Packed full of moments of black humour and cheeky hat-tips to Deathline (obviously!), American Werewolf in London and the Argento movies, it's a fun and blackly twisted 85 minutes, that bodes well for the future of director Christopher Smith.

The labyrinthine tunnels under London are a superbly evocative gothic setting for a horror flick and it is surprising that only Deathline had really used this venue before.

In places Creep verges on brilliance; most notably the jaw-droppingly inspired silent appearance of the Creep directly in front of Kate's terrified eyes, and the delightfully twisted extended ""operation"" scene. Creep does become rather routine and predictable at times, however.  I mean WHY focus so blatantly on the serrated spike jutting from the wall so that when the next messy demise occurs, we are all expecting it?

But enough nitpicking! It's great to see another satisfying Brit movie of this genre.  Apart from the very talented (and decorative!) Ms Potenta, some well-known Brit faces are found within, including Vas Blackwood (Lock Stock..., Mean Machine and various TV roles), Jeremy Sheffield (TV, The Wedding Date, Safe Haven, Anna Karenina) and TV legend Ken Campbell (Fawlty Towers!).

The soundtrack is excellent (The ""Insects"" sounding quite Tangerine Dreamy) and the film's 5.1 / DTS surround sound will more than satisfy you home-cinema techno-geeks, and adds much to the atmosphere.

Decent extras - director's commentary, interviews, making of  etc.

Finally, despite the large warning on the back of the DVD box, there is virtually no strobe lighting. It certainly didn't bother me in the way that gratuitously overused strobes in some other recent movies has.

The Creep is well worth adding to anyone's horror collection.",1140566400,6,1852,5.304794520547945
2436641,4,B000BQ5J8G,"Waiting for the tube train to Charing Cross Station?

Just like me. Thank God: it's late, and the platform is lonely---a little creepy, actually. Don't you think? It's nice, on a night like this, down in the Underground, to have company. Someone, you know, to talk to.

Because let's face it: an underground, a subway, the metro, whatever you call it---these are dank, desolate, scary little apertures in the Earth. They stink, positively reek, of sewage, maybe even rotting flesh, disease, plague, horror, the harbingers of Hell.

Oh, I can see it in your face: I'm getting carried away. I assure you, I've seen things that would turn your hair white.

I remember riding the Red Line in Manhattan one night: I was on a platform crowded with strangers, any one of whom---like the maniac a week before---might try to push me into the path of the subway train. What did I know of them?

They tell me the sound---you know, when a body falls in the path of a train---is like the sound of a bedsheet being ripped apart. The blood gushes up in astonishing torrents. That night the whole platform---all of us, New Yorkers, weary commuters---were treated to the spectacle of a troop of rats---huge, brawny, wiry sewer rats, each the size of a small dog---marching single file up one of the rails. They didn't give us the time of day. They had, no doubt, seen far scarier.

With that in mind, let's talk about ""Creep"", the shivery, nasty, ghoulish little slice of grue and agony conjured up by director Chris Smith.

It's pretty simple stuff: it's about a woman (Franka Potente, at once trendy London Fashionista and horrible London fashion victim) making the singular mistake of riding in the London Underground at night, ideally to get from Point A to Point B. Unfortunately for her---and happily for us, the audience---she falls asleep.

And when she wakes, she has missed her train, and the platform is abandoned.

And that's when the fun begins. I mean, let's put it this way: you know you're in for a rough night when a) you're locked in the Underground and b) a wandering rapist is the least of your worries.

See: something lives in those tunnels, in the Tube, in the dank, echoing, sh*t-besmeared crawlways that honeycomb the London Underground. Something monstrous, and cruel, and tortured, and very hungry. Hungry for human flesh.

I'm sorry---I see I've disturbed you. Our train should be coming soon, don't worry: though it seems to me it's at least 20 minutes late. Maybe it's not coming at all...

Anyway, ""Creep"" works, and works in spades, because it is an exploration in the most primal of terrors: the horror of being trapped, underground, cut off from any means of escape, suffocated by inky blackness, and pursued.

Pursued. Hunted. By something strange, perhaps alien: something utterly divorced from human reason. ""Creep"" is very atavistic in that regard: it's all about twisted, gnarled, inhumanly thin things dimly glimpsed in the shadows, pasty-skinned, sharp-toothed ghouls blind from the eternal night but preternaturally gifted in other senses, honed from decades of exile from the light.

It's all about hiding in some abandoned storehouse room, and seeing the doorknob to your sanctuary begin to twist and turn, this way and that...

I can see I've disturbed you---have no fear, it's just talk. The tube train should be here soon: let's chat a bit longer. ""Creep"", honestly, features one of the most acutely disturbing sequences---set in a derelict, diseased, abandoned operating room---that I've witnessed in a horror film in years. Without spoiling it for you, let me say this: it's all about pulling on those latex gloves. Brrrr.

""Creep"" is also densely atmospheric: whether it's the sere, techno-sterile warren of the upper hallways, the blistered and bare No-Man's Land of the empty and echoing platforms, the deadly buzzing shaftways of the tube itself, or the ruinous, dripping abbatoirs buried deep beneath a slumbering City---Smith & his crew have spared no expense in setting up their subterranean hunting ground, and as such the darksome nooks and paths and burrows of the Tube constitute a character in full: one that is, perhaps, not at all sane.

""Creep"", then, is a horror film that zigs where most flicks would zag, that revels in its gore and gristle and bloodletting, that wallows in the discomfort it will cause you, and makes no apology for it. It is all about that feeling you have when, at 3 in the morning, you hear heavy footsteps---my God, it sounds like footsteps!---on the floor above you, in a bedroom that must be empty because---for Christ's sake!---the house is empty, except for you.

""Creep"" is all about Fear. And, come to think of it---I don't think our train is coming at all, my sweet, and it's deliciously lonely down here on the platform---I've got something to show you.

Don't be afraid.

2436642,3,B000BQ5J8G,"Creep is perhaps a notch above the average slasher/gore fest movie. However I don't agree with the Director's and scriptwriter's opinion that the Creep finally achieves status as a more complicated and sympathetic villain. To me, the Creep comes across as the same old killing machine - without the nuance the Director so optimisticaly imputes to him.

Nevertheless, I do think fans of the horror genre will find this a worthwhile watch. The setting becomes the most interesting character in the movie. It is eerie and chilling to be projected into London's Underground after hours. The gleaming, fluorescent-lit station platforms and steep, steep escalators become all the more sinister as the viewer realizes they are leading to far murkier depths.

There is another recent horror movie that does an even better job of making the setting a main character in the film though. If you want to explore a deserted setting, echoing with eerie potential - check out Session 9.",1137110400,2,971,5.0625

2436644,3,B000BQ5J8G,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...

You know, I looked back over all of my reviews and was a little upset to see that I give most horror movies only one or two stars. I started to worry that I'm becoming too cynical in my reviewing. I started to think maybe I'm being too hard on these direct-to-video horror films. Maybe I'm not giving them a fair shake. Because, frankly, it seems like I really only like one out of every twenty horror movies that I watch. That's not a great ratio, and it made me think that I was being too hard on the movies. I actually considered going back and revising all of my votes. But then I saw CREEP.

Now, this is definitely not the best horror film that I've ever seen, and I can't say that I think it's destined to go down as a classic, but it's better than 90% of the garbage that's gracing the Blockbuster shelves these days. This film, along with DEAD END and LOVE OBJECT, prove that there are still people making good horror movies out there. So, I'm not going to recant, and I'm not going to start being easy on these movies. I will continue to hold them to a higher standard, because CREEP is pretty dang creepy.

This is basically a combination of RAW MEAT and Clive Barker's MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN featuring the German girl from RUN LOLA RUN, Franka Potente. Franka gets trapped in a London underground station, where there's some kind of lunatic surgeon weirdo that captures people and keeps them in underwater cages. This weirdo surgeon, I'm figuring he's the CREEP from the title, looks a little bit like that Yellow Bastard from SIN CITY combined with GOLLUM from Lord of the Rings. You're probably getting the idea... this guy's not good looking, let's leave it at that.

The Creep's got this whole room full of dead fetuses in formaldehyde jars, and he does this one surgery that, as a girl, I found really difficult to watch. I think that thing that's really creepy about this killer is that there isn't any real rhyme or reason to what he's doing. At least, not that I could understand. The creep had a whole agenda that made sense to him, but it was totally alien to me, and that made him scarier.

This movie is shot well, and it's nicely paced. It's not breaking any new ground, and it does feel a little familiar, which is why I didn't give it a perfect score. But even with it's semi-predictable plotline, it should definitely make you look around warily next time you're down in a subway station, and will make you think twice about taking a little nap while you wait for your train. Good for a creepy night of viewing, and also renewed my faith in independent horror films.",1136073600,6,2628,4.466666666666667
2436647,2,B000BQ5J8G,"`Creep,' a UK produced horror flick starring Franka `Run Lola Run' Potente, belongs to the sub-genre among the horror films - that is, horrors in the underground world. If you remember the films like `Mimic,' you know the basic rules.

It starts very well. Fun-seeking Kate (Potente), working in the London fashion industry, tries to go to a party where she hears a Hollywood celebrity will come. But instead of that, she finds herself trapped in the deserted subway station in London. To her dismay she learns that while she was sleeping, she missed the last train, and that all the shutters and doors of the station are closed.

But ... look! Another train arrives, and without thinking much, she hops into the car. But you know she shouldn't have done that. It is all the more so with these strange, empty cars, which run as if without driver or conductor, and suddenly slow down between the stations.

The set-up, which is, you can say, a subterranean version of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is certainly intriguing, and the images of the subway station are creepy. But the story soon loses its steam, and the film gradually becomes boring as it unfolds. The characters including homeless couple living in the station and the Afro-American sewerage worker are nothing new. Before the film explains the mystery of the ghost train itself, it leaps to the final chapter, of which atmosphere is totally different from that of the opening, and is too incredible for me, even though I know the history of London subway goes back to the time of Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, the writer/director Christopher Smith relies on the nastiness to make the film scary, which is too much for me.

There are good ideas in `Creep' and the film has creepy, claustrophobic moments. But even with short 85 minute running time, it uses up all its energy at the early stage, and the unique setting is relegated to a marginal role. What you see instead is formulaic plot device of slasher horror movies.",1135641600,5,1981,4.783625730994152
2436648,1,B000BQ5J8G,"Oh dear.  This film really should have been good.  The basic premise of being stuck in the British Underground which stops operating sometime after midnight should have led to a tense, claustrophobic horror/thriller.  Unfortunately it misfires on almost all cylinders.  I'm reminded of the great scene in 'An American Werewolf in London' where the businessman is stuck down in the London Underground and just how brilliantly executed the chase scene that followed was filmed.  The sense of dread, uncertainty & fear conveyed in those short couple of minutes beats all of the very few (if any) white knuckle moments you might experience with this film.  Franka Potente previously wonderful in 'Run Lola Run' & the 'Borne Supremacy' is horribly miscast here (as is her wardrobe).  Most scenes are too brightly lit (Darkness please, it's a horror movie people) and the leads garish outfit is probably the scariest thing in the movie.  30 minutes after the creep is introduced I was still waiting for the 'Creep' of the title to show up until it suddenly dawned on me that I'd already seen him and although the Creep figure is quite nicely played it hardly induced the dread, loathing or white-knuckle fear that a movie with this premise should have been able to deliver.  The other characters include a many cardboard cut-out characters.  An obnoxious boyfriend who is soon dispatched.  Your obligatory black guy & well you can guess how far he makes it in the movie.  Perhaps the only slightly original part was the homeless couple who were the only ones to engender any sense of empathy on my part.  There were far too many fake jump-scenes (scenes set up as a scare & then nothing happens) & the actual jump scenes were telegraphed so far in advance that they lost all shock value.  Strange fight scenes ensue and the Creep ends up as previous reviewers have mentioned as probably the most sympathetic characters in the film.  A sad sadistic Phantom of the Opera kind of character.  All in all I was highly disappointed.  Being British I really wanted this film to be a lot better and it could have been in the hands of a better director with better casting I'm sure.  Hopefully 'The Descent' another British Movie may be as good as everyone's saying and redeem the British Horror Movie industry somewhat.",1135296000,6,2305,4.821882951653944

Same with all the other characters. if you want to see a movie that explains the past history of every character then go watch Saving Private Ryan again (great show). this movie is about a girl, is a bad place, and she unwittingly drags more innocent people into some really bad situations.

There is a scene in the middle of the movie, I will call it the 'operation' scene - that was easily the best scene I have seen ina horror movie maybe ever.

So Franka Potente gets into a London Tube late at night and she is stuck there for the Underground is closed. Then she is being chased by something... someone... Now recall the Underground scene from ""An American Werewolf in London"" and try to imagine how you'd feel if you didn't know the guy was chased by a werewolf. Just someone who is not quite like a man... If you haven't read other reviews I won't tell you more no to spoil everything because at a certain moment of the film I was really scared seeing what I saw.
The movie is creepy and terrifying, it has all kinds of horror you'd wish - suspence, mystery, brutality and pure gore. You really feel for Franka Potente's character crying ""Run, Franka, run!"" all the time. Well, I wasn't crying, just thinking :)
There is an album called ""Goremageddon"" of a death-grindcore band ""Aborted"" (if you want you can check this CD here at Amazon). When sometime ago I saw this album cover I thought: I wish I'd see a horror movie one day with motives from this cover. And here it was: ""Creep"".
This is a kind of film where you don't get much of an explanation about what is going on. All is left for your imagination. But don't be afraid - you'll obviously come up with some explanation, besides I'm sure the American edition will have all the bonus features of the British one's. So from the interviews and ""Making of..."" film you'll learn the story and all the backgrounds at full.
It seemed to me ""Creep"" looked rather fresh among all other contemporary horror flicks although you can never guess whether one would like it or not.

2436655,4,B000BQ5J8G,"Is ""Creep"" an original film that contributes a new concept, theme, or idea into the genre of horror films? Does it create a villain so terrifying that it elicits screams of terror that will echo down the chambers of horror throughout the years alongside such horrifying characters such as Hannibal Lecter and Leatherface? On both accounts, ""Creep"" does not hit the mark. ""Creep"" is a bloody mishmash of all the good bits of a thousand horror movies made before it and in all that gorey pieces of pulverized bone and rotting flesh sewn together in a world in which almost everything concievable has been done a million times over, you will not find a modicum of originality. Does this mean that ""Creep"" has no merit or value? Is ""Creep"" unworthy of our viewing? I certainly think not. Its a flawed film with an atmosphere of dark swampy ambience permeated throughout with the smell of death and underground rot. The lead character is a snotty arrogant prude who has a sense of altruism and humaneness underneath her irritable demeanor. The villain is probably a genetically engineered hybrid between a rat and a human being. Unfortunately, unless they make a sequel (and lets hope they do not) the director never fully explains what exactly ""Greg,"" our little rat boy, is. In any case, visually he looks cool.

So take a journey into the labyrinth of dark tunnels beneath the city of London and see what writhing horrors await you there. Just don't expect another ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",1132876800,6,1493,4.83203125

By that I mean, this movie neither becomes boring nor does it ever reach a level of feeling satisfying.  It just hovers in the middle the whole way through.  It's about the attractive Franka Potente (who looks better as a blonde in my opinion) falls asleep at a subway station, and wakes up to find everybody is gone.  This moment here was *very* good I thought (and quite disturbing!)  Probably the best moment of the movie due to the eeriness of it.  It turns out there's either a monster or an aggressive man with a disfigured body roaming around looking to catch and stab anybody who happens to still be here after the subway train leaves.  They only come out at night!

Creep for the most part shows Franka running around avoiding this dangerous man, and avoiding rapists too.  She tries to encourage the security guard to open the door when the rapist is attacked and injured, but for some reason the security man has a nasty attitude and doesn't believe her.  He wants proof which hilariously means Franka has to drag the body closer to the security camera so he can see the body, since he refuses to open the door otherwise.  I guess you have to suspend disbelief to accept that someone would be so ignorant, haha.  Anyway the second best moment (obviously the best moment is the creepy atmosphere I mention above when Franka wakes up) is when Frank and a man played by Vas Blackwood get captured in a cage in a sewer and have to team together to escape.  Vas doesn't seem to have the same determination to free himself like Franka does, which is awkward because Franka's character has to do all the work.

I feel that the ending could've been a lot better, but considering the movie came out in 2004 instead of 2016 I'm more accepting of such an ending since the horror movie wasn't as used up/exhausted back then.  Or SPOILERS: perhaps such a lazy way for the monster to be killed was because the movie relies on atmosphere to carry it, and the writers were going for a subtle ending.  However the atmosphere wasn't strong enough in my opinion so I needed something more satisfying (perhaps involving the train in some way would have been a great idea).  The reviewers who mention a feeling of claustrophobia throughout the movie, well, that was lost on me.  I didn't get that sense. Still, a pretty good movie with a stronger than normal crazy lunatic man/monster going around capturing and stabbing people.  He obviously had a history since we see deformed children in glass jugs though more needed to be said to explain his history in detail.  I can put the pieces together and guess what the deal was his troubled past, so I won't complain about it.

A decent movie but again, I've seen *several* horror movies that accomplish more and leave a better feeling in my mouth than this one.  I recommend it but just barely.",1455753600,,3000,4.525046382189239
8090840,5,B000BQ5J8G,"Creep is another slasher throwback never to be missed because its Stag Night crossed over with The Descent. The idea of the mutant removing fetuses from women is really messed up in a way that you might vomit your guts out. Anyways, the leading lady Franka Potente is already working on the sequel to The Conjuring which is coming out this summer. Regardless, Creep was a gruesome but fun film to watch but if you don't like the violence in this film, I suggest you steer clear from this movie.
