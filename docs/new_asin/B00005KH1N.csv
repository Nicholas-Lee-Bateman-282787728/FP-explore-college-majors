8130571,5,B00005KH1N,"The main event is of a very high tension rivalry between The UnderTaker as a face and Steve Austin and HHH as the worst heels ever. If you are into this old rivalry, this event I am sure does be very intersting to you. This event should be the most satisfying to UnderTaker fans, like myself.",1355788800,3,292,4.232142857142857
8130572,1,B00005KH1N,"Unless you are an avid WWF/WWE video/dvd collector like myself then skip this stink fest of a pay per view.  I bought it to complete my entire WWE ppv collection.  If you are not a serious collector, and are more just curious about this event, take my advice and skip it!  If you want a fun WWF pay per view try Mayhem in Manchester.",1261180800,,333,4.171875
8130573,2,B00005KH1N,"WWF/E InsurreXtion 2001 has got to be the worst WWF/E United Kingdom PPV of ALL TIME. Only 1 Championship match and the whole card is a mess.
And of course, the title DOES NOT change hands -- what can you expect from a WWF/E Pay-per-View in the UK??? The WWF/E Title NEVER changes hands...
All in all this is the worst UK event. Get Rebellion 2000 if you want a *REALLY GOOD* UK PPV.",1076976000,,383,4.1891891891891895
8130574,1,B00005KH1N,"This was a real stinker! What more can you say about an international event? Personally, in my opinion, I find that these shows bite because it is more than obvious that none of the wrestlers want to be there. There are never any stipulated matches, there is no hype, the wrestling sucks, there is no serious rivalries to give us an out-of-control brawl and no titles ever change hands, and even when they do (I am referring to last year when British Bulldog pinned Crash to win the WWF Hardcore Title and WWF Rebellion when Crash pinned William Regal to win the WWF European Title) the title is always won back the next night on Raw. Isn't it ironic that Crash Holly is always involved with a UK title change? There was only one title match and there was no title change in that one. I really think Stone Cold Steve Austin as a heel is not working the way he wanted it to because no doubt the fan favourite Stone Cold would have walked away with the victory in this one. I'm sorry if this review hasn't been helpful! Take my advice, never order a UK PPV on Sky Box Office ever again. They rip you off every time! Don't even rent this piece of trash!",991094400,2,1150,4.304147465437788
8130575,4,B00005KH1N,"As Insurrextion whent on the air Commisioner Regal annnouonced the card was changed, so the main event would now be a handicaped match for the World Wrestling Federation Championship featuring; The Undertaker vs Trilple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The undercard was OK, but nothing special like the UK undercards are, So on to the main event. Most of the match,The Undertaker was in control, but in the end he pinned Triple H, so Stone Cold Steve Austin kept his WWF Title. Overall WWF Insurrextion was a pretty good event, and I would recomend buying it.",991008000,3,558,4.762886597938144
