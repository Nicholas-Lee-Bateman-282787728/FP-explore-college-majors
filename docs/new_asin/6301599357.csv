Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of the Brothers Grimm classic ""Rumpelstiltskin"" is timeless, first-rate entertainment.  Featuring a cast which includes series creator Shelley Duvall as the Miller's Daughter, as well as Ned Beatty as the king, Paul Dooley as the miller and Herve Villechaize in the title role, good performances expectedly are the calling card of this adaptation.

In particular, the late Mr. Villechaize turns in a stellar performance as the villainous troll.  By turns sympathetic as he wins the Miller's Daughter's trust and cold as he gives his unswerving demands for her meager possessions and finally her child, he plays Rumpelstiltskin beautifully.  His performance far outdoes the clownish, rhyming one turned in by Billy Barty in the Cannon Fairytales series.

This is a special show, and one of the many reasons Faerie Tale Theatre's output during the 1980's arguably outshined The Walt Disney Company for excellent fairytale adaptations during the same time period.  Highly recommended.",1264982400,,1031,5.528662420382165
7812894,5,6301599357,"When I watched this episode, I had forgotten how silly most of the actors were in it.  Herve Villechaize was very good as Rumpelstiltskin.  It was very close to the original version told by the Grimm Brothers.  I loved watching Ned Beatty going goo-goo ga-ga over the baby in the show.  It was nice to see Shelley Duvall acting in this one as well as introducing the story.",1257292800,,373,4.4411764705882355
7812895,2,6301599357,"I have been a fan of the Faerie Tale Theater series since I was a little kid, and I just recently was given the DVD box set of all the movies for Christmas.

  I love these movies! Shelly Duvall is a genious for bringing her magical creations to the screen. They are so fun to watch and bring so many memories from my childhood back to me!

  However, this specific story upsets me every time I see it! I have never understood how anyone could actually enjoy this tale. Shelley Duvall plays the millers daughter, who is handed over to the greedy, annoying, money hungry King played by Ned Beatty, after the King is told she can spin straw into gold. Well, Shelley Duvall CAN'T spin straw into gold and she is honest with the king, but he warns her that he will kill her if she doesn't spin it into gold (What a NICE guy, huh??).

  Anyways, to make a long story short-she hires a little elvish creature-who she makes a fairly valid deal with-to save her life-and ends up cheating him in the long run. The two things that upset me about this story are the fact that the King is sooooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly evil and greedy, yet he gets everything in the end and is made out to be some sort of hero, and also the fact that poor Rumplestiltskin made a deal with a girl who decides to go back on it at the last minute.

  It wasn't his fault-he wanted a baby and she promised him one-so, what gives her the right to be some martyr in the end? I hate this story! My favorite Faerie Tale Theater creations are Snow White, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, The Three Little Pigs, Thumbelina and Pinnochio.

  RUMPIE WAS ROBBED!!!!!",1138492800,3,1629,4.383333333333334
7812896,3,6301599357,"RUMPELSTILTSKIN is an average entry in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series.  Shelley Duvall, host and creator of the series, takes center stage as the winsome Miller's Daughter.

The Miller (Paul Dooley) is constantly telling tall tales, but his latest lie just might result in the death of his daughter (Shelley Duvall).  When the Miller tells the King (Ned Beatty) that his daughter can spin straw into gold, the King orders she be brought to the palace to work her miracle.

Imprisoned in the palace, the Miller's Daughter is visited upon by a strange little man (Herve Villechaize) who helps her out of her dilemma.  But will the price be more than the Miller's Daughter can pay?...

This is only the second episode in the series, and features fine acting from Duvall and Villechaize.  A real charmer.",1098921600,5,800,4.838235294117647
7812897,5,6301599357,"After years of waiting, Faerie Tale Theatre fans can finally own the series on DVD. Shelley Duvall's series originally appeared on Showtime 20 years ago and featured well-known and rising stars of the time. The series' campy enthusiasm for fairy tales has made it a cult classic. Better yet, the DVD prices are affordable, especially after the high prices the used VHS copies have been earning in recent years.

About this episode:

A miller's daughter receives help from a quaint little man when she needs it most, but not without agreeing to pay a dear price later.  Finally she must guess her helper's name to keep her most precious treasure, her child.
