8088709,4,B000BM7YQU,"In El Camino de Los Espantos(The Road of the Spooks, 1967), Viruta(Marco Antonio Campos) and Capulina(Gaspar Henaine)are stuck in a rural area after their truck is stolen. Viruta, Capulina, two cute girls(Elsa Cardenas and Salome), and a motley crew of strangers are stuck in the only shelter available...a haunted mansion! Roberto Gomez Bolanos(a.k.a. Chespirito)wrote the screenplay for this film and don't be surprised if you see the same plot on an episode of TV's El Chapulin Colorado(starring Gomez Bolanos as the title character). This film is a fun way to kill 90 minutes and the theme song 'Yo Se' is very catchy! Keep your ears open: composer Sergio Guerrero wrote some boogie-woogie music as a rat crawls into Capulina's pants! The same music cue can be heard in Me Quiero Casar(1966) as Angelica Maria listens to a car radio! This movie is perfect for a Halloween party.",1253059200,,882,5.006802721088436
