8135630,2,B000H0MN44,This was really bad the creature looked ridiculous and the actors were not serious. Only bought cuz im a fan of killer rabbit films but this was not even clever. The 2-stars is cuz i liked 1or2 of the death scenes.,1515024000,,214,4.2439024390243905

8135632,5,B000H0MN44,"Kottentail is a very cool low-budget horror-comedy with plenty of gore, laughs, and T & A. If you like movies like Thankskilling & Poultrygeist, then you should definitely check out Kottentail as it's in the same vein and just as entertaining in my opinion.",1445040000,,257,4.863636363636363

8135635,3,B000H0MN44,"Watched this after watching Blood Stained Bride [from the same studio distributors] and this was definately more funny with superb tongue in cheek acting from the majority of the actors.  Cheap and cheerful and a nice comic book style presentation from the classic horror comics era of old.  Plenty of nice looking girls and a fair attempt at some gore.

Two animal activists free a bunny rabbit [that moves on a string or slow motion effect!]recently injected with a serum that makes him aggressive.  He bites a German farmer who then turns into a vicious mutant rabbit/human!  All the men appear as dorks in this film so it left to the five girls to dress in bunny outfits to try and trap him/it.  Well I found it funny!",1173830400,,722,4.6015625
8135636,5,B000H0MN44,"If you enjoy original indie films with new ideas, fresh perspectives and are gut busting funny, then buy this movie.  Mr. Urban takes a completely new look at horror comedy, by inroducing a rather lovable but unique villain and it succeeds at every level.  Even the casting for this film was a novel idea as the cast was culled from the ""I Want To Be A Scream Queen"" online contest.  Beyond all that, this film is funny.  BUY IT !",1156377600,,430,4.3375
