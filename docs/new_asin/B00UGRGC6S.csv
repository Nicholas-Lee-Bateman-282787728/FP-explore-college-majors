8706783,1,B00UGRGC6S,$750 for a used movie disc? Good one!... that Really must be the apocalypse.  Get real u crazy... Lol  unless your Mel Gibson himself selling his own used signed copy .....  I guess you could always hope someone accidentally buys it and you get rich accidentally selling all your  extreme overpriced used stuff. You must really like that movie and think your used things are very special!,1534464000,,388,4.746268656716418

8706785,4,B00UGRGC6S,It takes a crazy mind to pay 432 $ for a dvd or blue ray...? What is this..?,1495670400,8,76,3.2777777777777777
8706786,5,B00UGRGC6S,It's great to own a DVD that cost as much as a car note. I feel previliedge and honor to own this movie. Those without it are jealous of the ones with it. And of course I would have paid 3x the asking price of $432.00.,1469664000,11,218,3.760869565217391
