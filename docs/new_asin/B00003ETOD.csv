7918591,5,B00003ETOD,"really interesting double feature. spanish earth: . not one car chase, no sex, blood, hard techno beats or guitar solos. one corpse actually, a war, some peasants and a bakery. a time capsual from another era. documentary, somewhat styleised but interesting for it. hard to give it marks out of 5, it is what it is. if you want an insight into the spanish civil war and an unglamerous perception of the time, and if you want a perspective on those who were involved in the making of the film and why, this is a cool piece. 400million is more dynamic but still a period piece and fascinating for it. i cant find a reason not to reccomend these. again, they are what they are. 5/5. go buy these pieces of history.",1062028800,7,711,4.393939393939394
