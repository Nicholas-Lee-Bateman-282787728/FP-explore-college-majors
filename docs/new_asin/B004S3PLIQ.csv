8439452,4,B004S3PLIQ,"Devilman is another one of Go Nagais babys. As you may guess it this is problably one of the most violent anime outhere. Devilman is about a teenager named Akira Fudo. At first, Akira is very shy, modest and gentle, trying to avoid conflict. When his parents are lost on a business trip in the Arctic, Akira goes to stay with his childhood friend Miki Makimura and her family (mother, father, and bratty kid brother Tare). Both soon form a close relationship. Miki, a tough, smart, self-sufficient girl, loves Akira but wishes that he would stand up for himself when he gets pushed around, and is frustrated by his lack of backbone. She often has to defend herself from bullies even when Akira is with her. In the first OVA, she saves Akira from a gang of bullies who are threatening him.

One day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks a favor and completely changes Akira's life. Ryo's father had discovered the existence of demons when he found a mask during an excavation of the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple. This mask turns out to be a fossilized demon skull, which shows whomever wore it what the world was like when demons ruled over it. Ryo shows Akira this and informs him about the demons' revival. Akira then sees Ryo's plan: ""To fight a demon, one must become a demon.""

Demons have the ability to possess and control humans. However, Ryo believes that people like Akira may be able to harness a demon's powers when possessed, due to the fact that Akira has a pure heart. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub and picks a fight to draw demonic attention to the club. Demons possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a demon known as Amon the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell, and also one of the strongest demons attempts to possess Akira. However Akira manages to gain the upper hand of the possessing process with Amon and transforms into Devilman. Devilman contains the strength and power of the demon Amon, as well as the heart and soul of Akira, giving Akira complete control.

After he becomes Devilman, Akira is no longer timid and shy. He becomes very aggressive and no longer lets anyone push him around. This change pleases Miki, although she is unaware of Akira's new-found powers.

This movie is the follow up to the popular Devilman ova from the 90s. Time has passed since Akira Fudo was possessed by the powerful demon Amon, giving him the ability to change into Devilman. Humans have become increasingly paranoid of demon attacks, resorting to murder of innocent civilians with mob mentality - among nicer things. Akira continues to fight against the demon armies with his companions - but when his girlfriend Miki is brutally murdered, his will breaks and the sadistic Amon is unleashed, controlling his body. The final battle awaits in Akira's mind - can he defeat Amon and control his body once more?

If you have not seen the original ova i cannot recomend this one in particular. If you love Devilman or Go nagaior just want a super offencive and violent anime then this one is for you. However i gave it 4 stars because the subs are a little bit messed up and its too short.(50 min)",1300060800,2,3139,4.608228980322004
