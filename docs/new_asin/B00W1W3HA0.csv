7114464,1,B00W1W3HA0,The product details say there's only 1 disc in this set. That is so obviously not correct. How many discs are there really?,1443830400,,123,4.391304347826087
7114465,5,B00W1W3HA0,"Charlie Sheen's golden years are the first seasons from Season 1-8. These are the best episodes of the entire series. It's actually quiet a MASTERPIECE !  - I recommend everyone to see it !

The rest of the show (the last seasons) are bad. So this is just a hint !",1439078400,18,264,4.1568627450980395
7114466,3,B00W1W3HA0,"Two and a Half Men. It started off as a simple sitcom that starred Charlie Sheen & Jon Cryer about a guy who lets his brother stay with him after his brother's wife throws him out. I know, simple premise, right? Sounds like The Odd Couple, right? Well, sort of. It started out decently, then became its own entity by season 3. This series, generally filled with Chuck Lorre's staples of his shows, never ceased to entertain for the first 8 seasons. Charlie Sheen & Jon Cryer made a decent duo, as their characters Charlie & Alan Harper, & there wasn't an episode that didn't make me at least chuckle.
Then, the 9th season came. Unfortunately, Charlie Sheen had gone on a drug-fueled binge that, unfortunately, caused him to make anti-Semitic comments about the show's creator, Lorre, which ended up in his being fired from the series. Rather than film a finale & end the series, CBS decided to fire Sheen & softly reboot & continue the series. This lead to the killing off of Sheen's character & the bringing on of Ashton Kutcher's character, Walden Schmidt. Whether this worked or not is a matter of perspective, but I don't think it did, at least to the level that it did with Sheen.
Schmidt was obviously an unneeded plot contrivance. For those who are a part of the uninitiated, Charlie was a commercial jingle & kid's song writer. Now, Alan inherited his house after he was killed off, which is another contrivance because of a minute's worth of dialogue from a few seasons prior, but the question persisted, why isn't Alan trying to collect the royalties from the songs Charlie wrote? That's the first question I had when seeing the first episode of season 9, but they never even thought to bring it up until the finale, which was a nice collection of jokes hyping up so a disappointing payoff, since Lorre wouldn't budge on using Sheen's idea for his character's final scene over what was already written, which would've been a lot better. Instead, we got a disappointing final moment that seemed very hate-filled towards Sheen, that was basically a big middle finger to everyone watching. That single moment made it a series finale that could rival How I Met Your Mother's in how disappointing they ended up being, but it's certainly less insulting, to a degree, because it doesn't undo a lot of important character development that was, even in the last season, set up just to fit the creator's original intention.
The main thing I'm getting at, is there are 2 different eras of the show. The Charlie Sheen, golden, years, then the Ashton Kutcher, bronze age, years. The Charlie Sheen years are indisputably better. The characters were ok, the plots were ok, & it was definitely more logical, believable, & funny. The Ashton Kutcher years were just pitiful. Not only does the logic just get thrown out the window to get Alan to stay in the house, but the stories & characters get much, much worse. Alan is flanderized to a degree the first 8 years wouldn't have let him get to, being more cheap, stingy, & just overall unpleasant. Walden also changed too fast. At the beginning of season 9, he was the complete antithesis to Charlie, minus having enough money, but then as the seasons continued, he got more like Charlie, even though it was completely illogical he'd change as quick as he did. Main thing is, watch the first 8 seasons. They're much better & the later seasons are just not as good. It lost its luster & left us at a place where we feel more disappointed than entertained.",1429228800,37,3496,4.667747163695299

It would've been a no-brainer to rate it 5 stars  for being one of the funniest shows around, but I just discovered that the season 8 case only had one disc as opposed to the normal 4 in each season. Of course I missed the return window by 13 days but I didn't think I had to open each box to make sure all disc were included.

7114496,5,B00W1W3HA0,"I'm going to surprise some of the reviewers here. I love the whole series, and I learned a lesson in humor while doing so. NEVER believe professional reviewers. Believe your own eyes and ears! Please let me explain.
When ""Two and a Half Men""  was a prime time smash hit, I was working a retail job and never got to see the show in first run. After I retired at 53, I finally saw the show in afternoon reruns and became a huge fan.
I bought only Seasons 1-8 (The Charlie Sheen years), individually, as they came out. First, they were the only reruns being shown. Next, at the time, I'd read mediocre, if not horrible reviews for the Ashton Kutcher years (Seasons 9-12).
LESSON TIME, LATE 2016: A local station has begun showing the Kutcher reruns. I find myself belly-laughing at these episodes also, just as I do with the Sheen years.
Are these latter episodes exactly as funny as the original Sheen years? Not quite. The ""sibling rivalry factor"" between Charlie Harper (Sheen) and his hopelessly nerdy brother, Alan, (the brilliantly funny Jon Cryer), is missing.
That said, Cryer retains his character's hilariously  doltish persona, and Kutcher's handsome-hunk, internet billionaire fellow, Walden Schmidt, while not as consistently funny as Sheen, is nevertheless very, very funny when called upon!
 Thank you ABC-7, for finally sharing the Ashton Kutcher reruns of the show. If you haven't seen them, you're missing out!",1480636800,4,1425,4.904564315352697
