Mehek Chahal doesn't come after the interval, she does excellent in the scenes she does have and her chemistry with Harbhajan Mann is mindblowing. Dara Singh does well as well, Deep Dhillion as the father does make a impact, Kawaljit doesn't have much to do and Aman Noori is good as well. overall this film is rich in emotions and is one of the better family dramas made in India, families should love it. More punjabi films should be made like these, so rent the DVD today!!!",1304467200,,774,4.457746478873239

If you have watched either of Harbhajan Mann's previous movies, you pretty much know what to expect.  The story and dialogue in his previous movies is better, in this movie, it is ok. The sound track is very nice and I would recommend buying the CD. The movie itself if worth a watch for some light hearted family entertainment and to watch the always entertaining Ghuggi. Ghuggi is not as funny in this movie though as he usually his.",1166400000,,572,4.287037037037037
