7875592,1,6304681054,"Todd Sheets makes the lowest budget films possible.  He gets nonactors to spout highly derivative dialogue that makes no sense. He also uses whatever sets he can scrounge together and it looks like it. Cheap Cheap Cheap. His dystopian city that this takes place around is just a city shot in the early A.M. hours. No damage is done to any building. His props are cheap and unbelievable. His stunt work is atrocious and not suspenseful.  His special effects are ridiculous. The storyline involves a laboratory created mutant, but no lab is shown. One of the characters is a doctor. She has one microscope and one stethoscope. No medical instruments are shown. When a vital operation needs to be performed, the camera just jumps to the next scene. I've seen better high school films.",1480550400,,781,4.82089552238806

7875594,1,6304681054,"After opening w/ one of the worst theme songs ever conceived (Moooonchild! Mooooonchillldd! Moo-ooo-ooon-chhiiildd!), MOONCHILD begins. We are introduced to the mysterious Mr. Walker (John Carradine) and a young art student (Mark Travis), who is painting a church. Mr. Walker leads him on a strange, absurd journey, filled w/ nonsensical imbecility and pseudo-symbolic claptrap. The student meets various characters, both good and eeevil, including The Manager (Pat Renella), The Maitre De (Victor Buono- THE MAD BUTCHER), and The Homunculus (Frank Corsentino). Walker blathers in typical, histrionic Carradine fashion. The Manager and Maitre De tempt, torment, and babble on in one crackpot diatribe after another. MOONCHILD is what passed for ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking"" back in 1974. Of course, even then, this was mind-numbing bilge. Watching it now makes one long for drugs, any drugs, especially fatal ones! Luckily, the flashback sequences make even less sense than the rest of this dog's vomit of a ""film"". I defy anyone to A) Survive to the end of this suicide suppository, and B) make any logical, even emotional sense of any of its lunk-headed dialogue or idiot imagery! Beware the hog's head scene! It's ludicrous AND gross! This could be called an ""art film"" in the same way that a lead pipe to the skull could be called a ""headache cure"". Pardon me, I'm losing control of my faculties! My soul is turning to whipped cream! I die now...",1419897600,,1452,5.182978723404255
7875595,4,6304681054,"Moonchild (1971 - 1974) is a slightly above par experimental student horror film from one of the godfathers of student film, Alan Gadney. There's an interesting story that borders in some parts on the uneasy side (some suggestions of odd relations between student (Mark Travis) and a cramped guild of eccentric personalities), and in the film there is some pretty neat symbolism.

Any experimental fan or fan of the unusual horror genre will appreciate this.",1384905600,,458,5.1066666666666665

7875597,4,6304681054,"This was fun to watch and will appeal to people who like early 70's low budget horror films or the show Night Gallery. If that's not your genre I'd say skip it. The story has some elements that would be dealt with in later films (like The Sentinel & The Shining (though its nowhere near as polished as those two)) and some parts evoke the artsier scenes in Easy Rider.  This was shot at the Mission Inn in Riverside, CA.",1283212800,,420,4.25

7875600,5,6304681054,"""...I have loved you.  And I have loved you every summer since."" (from MOONCHILD).
NOTE: the film ""MOONCHILD"" dir. by Alan Gadney is NOT the film reviewed below.
Gadney's film stars John Carradine & Victor Buono, and is a brilliant dark fantasy about a man who is forced to relive the closing days of his life (every 25 years) until he achieves perfection (purges the demons of bloodlust which keep him, and the other characters, trapped in a neverending cycle of death).
Beautifully shot on a budget (reportedly as a thesis project for USC), this film intercuts scenes from several of the protagonist's past lives with the present one in a manner that is both daring and disconcerting.
Carradine is brilliant as The Walker of the World -- an angel of sorts, sent to witness and record the proceedings.  It's beyond all doubt one of his greatest roles.
Sadly, this film has long been overlooked (to the point of not even appearing in ""complete"" film lists for Carradine, Buono and others).
Part metaphysics, part dark fantasy, part poetry, part horror: and one of my all-time favorites.",1022976000,5,1086,4.833333333333333
7875601,5,6304681054,"Ambitious, wildly entertaining and really entertaining. The costumes, lighting and set design are very impressive and the acting is better than most low budget films. Great storyline  follows a hero in the future that has some wolf genetics and his travels and battles to find his son and defeat the evil empire. Science Fiction with a dash of Horror, this one really surprised me and shows what can be done on such a low budget. Director Todd Sheets is a major talent in the low budget field and I predict big things if Moonchild is any indication.",982281600,2,549,4.65979381443299
