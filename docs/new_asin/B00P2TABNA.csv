8686283,5,B00P2TABNA,not a run of-the-mill ski movie. a narrative with great ski footage artfully spliced into a relevant story.  so many ski movies degenerate into a series of helicopter-filmed shots of straight downhill runs off knife edges in Alaska with the A-list of ski-film superstars. I've seen this so many times it has stopped being a wow moment. I'd rather see tree skiers blasting lines in deep powder and launching off pillows and drop-offs or turning a ski area into a playground of terrain features just to name a couple of the great sequences in this film. It's worth a second watch,1468886400,,577,4.712871287128713
8686284,5,B00P2TABNA,Favorite ski video so far. Those guys rock the resort scene. I like seeing normal ski slopes sometimes. It feels more real and relatable; compared to mtn I will never ski - nor any normal person would.,1444867200,,201,4.45945945945946

8686286,5,B00P2TABNA,Any ski fanatic will love watching this movie. A mixture of awesome ski footage and words of wisdom it will leave you longing to hit the slopes yourself.,1419811200,,153,4.5
