I am sorry you got conned into buying it, and am really glad you told the rest of us about it. I was going to buy it, but I won't now. I may check out the book though. Thanks for the heads up. Perhaps we can do the same for you in the future.",1265241600,19,378,3.7375
1782988,1,B00006JU9I,Just to let you people know...they have never made Last Full Measure..the third part of the Gods and Generals/Gettysburg trilogy. Ted Turner backed out it on the box office failure of Gods and Generals. They say it may still be made sometime down the road,1262476800,36,255,4.688888888888889

Nice man, but not at all what I wanted. It didn't inspire me to even get through 10 minutes of listening to him. He would ponder ideas for 5 seconds at times. As if he was going to fall asleep. It put me to sleep.",1231632000,131,441,4.068965517241379

This dvd was described as the 3rd part to the Trillogy.  Wrong.  It came in a dvd case which was about the Vietnam War.  There was a sticker on the case saying Last Full Measure Gettysburg.  When you start the dvd which has a Vietnam War label, it begins with an airplane.  Then Stacy Keach starts talking.  It is a documentary that lasts approximately 1 hour.  This is in no way worth $14.99 plus tax and shipping.  This is a total disappointment and should have been given free with the other 2 movies.  Don't buy it.  Waste of money and time.",1225238400,240,775,5.483050847457627
1782992,1,B00006JU9I,"Yes, at the end of Gods and Generals, there is a note about a Civil War trilogy which includes (in chronological order)Gods and Generals, Gettysburg (or, the book title: Killer Angels), and The Last Full Measure.  However, only the first 2 are movies.  All 3 can be bought as a book trilogy---which preceded the films.  (Except there is apparently a 30 min. VHS tape called Last Full Measure, which is a short documentary about Gettysburg, but not a motion picture.)  Hope this helps!  (I give 1 star only because I bet most of us were hoping there was a 3rd motion picture to the series!)",1124668800,136,589,4.571428571428571
1782993,3,B00006JU9I,"Hello my friends. Im, not really sure this is indeed the sequel to Gods and Generals, and Gettysburg.  I say this, because I don't think that the real film has been released yet. Taking this into account, I am perplexed about what the two previous revews were exactly reviewing about.  This is a mystery worth solving.  In the meantime watch Gods and Generals, as well as Gettysburg; both are outstanding films----and don't give up hope for the real conclusion in The Last full Measure. This is not ""The Last Full Measure"" (what I, and my fellow reviwers are appearently reviewing)......The, ""the"" is missing-----see what I mean; this movie is just ""Last Full Measure"".  Lastly, I provided this film III stars, because Im not sure what it is about, all I know, is that it is not ""The Last Full Measure"" we all seek.  I hope I havnt confused you even more than you were before you read this review......yeah.  Ok my friends, stay true.",1075852800,78,934,4.664634146341464

1783047,4,B00006JU9I,It was not what I was expecting.  I thought that it would be the movie based on the book The Last Full Measure by Jeff Shaara but it turned out to be a good movie nonetheless.,1423440000,,175,3.861111111111111
1783048,2,B00006JU9I,"2 stars because I don't like the word HATE.......Glad I read the reviews.  Nothing in the display ad indicates that this is not a movie.  I saw Gods and Generals when it first came out and saw the trailer about the 3rd in the trilogy.  I just figured that some day some one would do a full length movie on the book.  That has not happened apparently............  The reviews answer why there has not been any marketing, that I am aware or, regarding a new full length movie to complete the movie trilogy.

he was such an awesome man.  I admire him for his honesty, humility, and just plain common sense.  I was shocked to read that
he allowed such corruption and greed from his subordinates when he was President.  Shaara said it was because he was so used to everyone
doing what he/she said they would do. Makes sense since he was in charge of the Army of the Potomac. Julia, his wife, was quite her own
person. So many things I could say.  One of Shaara 's best!",1379894400,,579,4.373831775700935

1783113,1,B00006JU9I,"I watched this last night and much to my dismay the entire show lasted slightly less than half an hour.  It was produced by a local PBS station in Pennsylvania and the amateurish and dull presentation was surprising due to Stacey Keach's involvement.

I was interested in viewing this because of Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton's involvement.  Sadly, Catton did not really come across particularly well (he was, after all, quite elderly in the footage shown); nor did he make comments beyond the most superficial regarding this quintessential American battle.",1300838400,6,562,5.222222222222222
1783114,1,B00006JU9I,"The Last Full Measure is probably in book form only.

I've seen this movie advertized as a documentary about the Civil War with picture of the war and not helicopters . This one was made in 2008 Release Date: September 2, 2008. Run Time: 30 minutes but originally released in 1985 also lists Stacy Keach .
 Glad I didn't buy it. Lets see how this new one goes.

Bruce Willis
Morgan Freeman as Jimmy Burr
Laurence Fishburne as Harold Hunter
Andy Garcia as Fred Navarro
Amy Madigan

Charlie Hunnam as William H. Pitsenbarger

But then it goes on to say ""Thirty-three years after his death, during one of the bloodiest days of the Vietnam War, Air Force Pararescue Jumper William H. Pitsenbarger is awarded the Medal of Honor after a young Washington bureaucrat and fellow veterans of Operation Abilene get Congress to reconsider the legacy of his sacrifice. From a true story.""

1783117,1,B00006JU9I,"It is deceptive to have this item listed among the Civil War trilogies. I have been studying the civil War for some time now. I am aware that the DVD entitled: ""Last Full Measure"" is in the filming process, and scheduled to be released in 2010, with a great cast of actors. As a matter of fact, Julien Adams (The Last Confederate) will have a feature role. The DVD, as seen here has nothing to do with the expected movie, nor with the series: ""Gods and Generals"", ""The Killer Angels"" and ""Last Full Measure"" as written by Michael and Jeff Sharra (sic). I have read all three books and have seen the movies, along with many others: ""Gods and Generals"", ""Killer Angels"", ""Glory"", ""North and South"", ""The Last Confederate"" and ""Gettysburg"". For these reasons, I really think this item should be removed from the Civil War list as it does not relate to that period. Then again, perhaps this is just an honest mistake made by someone who does not know the difference. All the same, it should be removed from this particular listing.",1267142400,19,1027,4.586956521739131

It is a terrific video, featuring excerpts of what may have been one of the last interviews with the late Bruce Catton. The quality of the DVD has been improved considerably - I was thrilled!
