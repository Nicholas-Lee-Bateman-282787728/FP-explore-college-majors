5071719,1,B007AFS0N2,"Why wait until the end of the month to buy this when you can get the same thing right now with one less piece of cardboard? Just buy the individual seasons then find a big rubber band to put around them and you will have exactly the same thing that is being marketed by Warner Home Video as the ""Collector Set"" of Chuck.",1349568000,10,320,4.095238095238095

5071721,5,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck was, especially in the first couple seasons, an awesome show.  It was a mix of action, comedy and drama.  It was sometimes totally preposterous and over-the-top, but it never took itself too seriously.  For people who have a hard time suspending their disbelief, this is not a show for you.  The entire premise of a guy getting government secrets beamed into his head, and then having a CIA and NSA handler accompany him through weekly adventures is not even remotely realistic.  If you can get beyond that however and just be entertained by a funny, well-acted show you should give this a shot.

Chuck was really only 4 seasons long.  The first was cut short by the writer's strike and the 5th was only a 13 episode season. It was a show that was always teetering on the brink of cancellation. but managed to survive.  The die hard fans may remember that it came out the same year as the Bionic Woman reboot which NBC promoted constantly.  This is the show that should have been pushed, and if it was it may have had better ratings at the outset.  But even without the massive promotional machine it managed to hang around. While having Yvonne Strahovski in various stages of undress from week-to-week probably helped that, it was the overall quality of the series that made it what it was.

It was another show that had an ensemble cast of relative unknowns, which ended up working well.  Everyone from the main characters to the Buy More ancillary characters did a great job in their roles.  The series gave all the characters a chance to have a story, and really evolve.  There were also a lot of  nerdy pop culture references throughout the course of the show.  There were references to Star Wars, Die Hard, Groundhog Day, Back to the Future, Dune, James Bond, The Terminator, and on and on.

Obviously there is a massive amount of subjectivity in liking or disliking a show, especially one like this.  Die hard fans of the show probably already own the seasons, some may be holding out for a box set for the series and some may just be checking it out.  For those in the last category I would definitely recommend it given the proviso I made earlier about suspension of disbelief.  There are cheaper options than this particular packaging though so you probably want to do some price shopping.",1346630400,119,2305,4.616707616707616
5071722,5,B007AFS0N2,What a ripoff $199 You could buy each individual season 1-4 for on Blu Ray for $20 each at the Warner Bros site. It's kind of odd that Warner Bros shop sells season 1-5 as a bundle for $239. Maybe they need to learn some math why would anybody in the right mind buy a bundle that cost over $100 more if you bought them individually.,1337731200,14,332,4.045454545454546
5071723,2,B007AFS0N2,"I am a huge fan of the show Chuck but the price for this box set is ridiculous. Shows like All in the Family, The Wire, Homicide:Life on the Street are great and each have a box set of the complete series that cost half as much as this one. First it seemed like NBC didn't want to catch the last season of this show and now with the pricing it feels as if the powers that be want to make it difficult to purchase this fantastic collection.",1336435200,2,439,4.0
5071724,5,B007AFS0N2,"This is one of the most fun and intelligently written series that has hit the air in recent years.  There is a reason the fanbase is so rabid.  Note that this is not a collection from Warner Bros., the rights holder which has not announced any plans for a complete series set.  Amazon has chosen to shrinkwrap the separate products together so give buyers that option.  (As such, they have limitations on the pricing discount.)  The negative reviews out so far have been bashing the product release cycle, ignoring the quality of the product itself.  I own the series in this format, purchased individually.

Bottom line: if you want well written geeky fun that is equal parts action and comedy, you've found it here.  Enjoy!",1336089600,5,725,4.744

5071728,1,B007AFS0N2,"Ok lets start off by identifying who your market is. We are DIE HARD FANS!!!!! Do you really think that we will be satisfied by you just bundling all the separate seasons together and giving us a discount!?!?!?! What is wrong with you WB?!?!?! This is how you want to reward the fans that petitioned, went to Subway, and basically followed the series like junkies?!?!

You didn't even take the time to make a simple box to put the discs in with some arts on it. It is the lowest of the low way of presenting a series that we have come to love and cherish. I have been staring at this page daily for the last month and a half waiting to see what you would do. If you were going to change the picture and show us something that was worthy of OUR show. I even did the same thing with the WB page, and same thing;

You could have done anything, you could have made a cheap box, you could have even put them all in a single case. Or you could have done what we all expected and hoped you would do and made something SPECTACULAR. Bundled with some intersect glasses or a buymore shirt, a Jeffster cd. I mean come on!!!!! the amount of ideas that the simplest Chuck fan could produce is astounding. This was a great show, one that we will sorely miss. It deserves to be sent out with a bang.

I would have gladly shelled out good money if you had done even the simplest of things to honor this show. Instead it feels like you consider the show garbage, and us fans even lower than that.

Seriously.... EPIC FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I say we boycot this and rally, lets show the WB the same thing we showed when they said they would cancel Chuck. We petitioned, we shouted ""HELL NO"". I say we force them to make a box set that is worthy of Chuck. Lets let our voices be heard again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1334793600,138,1791,4.2558823529411764

5071772,3,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck was a great series. The Amazon price for the Blu-ray set was the best I could find and you cant beat prime shipping. The disks play fine and the picture looks great, but I was pretty disappointed to see that each disc does not have a menu that allows you to select individual episodes. It plays all the episodes on the disc consecutively unless you stop it, with no gap in between. If you want an particular episode of the show, you have to read the description on the pamphlet and try to match it up with what you see happening. I have a much older boxed DVD sets (Seinfeld, Psych) that have a menu for each disc disc that allows you to select any episode. It seems like laziness on the part of Warner Bros. In summary, I would totally buy them again but they could have done a much better job with the disc menus. Also, as previously mentioned, season one is packaged differently than seasons two through five. Why?",1514332800,3,923,4.341040462427745

5071785,5,B007AFS0N2,this series was the best show that was ever on TV. I enjoyed the characters especially Chuck and Sarah and their relationship as a grew through the series,1508976000,,154,4.535714285714286
5071786,5,B007AFS0N2,"I must make this confession: I didn't discover this show until September 2017 via a YouTube clip.  Now I have been on YouTube for years and never saw a Chuck anything before so out of curiosity I clicked on that clip and was immediately captured by it's quality.  So I searched for more clips and the show just drew me in further and further and I eventually asked myself, ""How did I not know about this fantastic show???"" I decided to buy the full series and I am so very glad I did.  It has a wide variety of genres: Comedy (of various kinds), drama (that is often times deep and sometimes tragic), love story, and profound character interaction -- I could go on and on.

There are some well recognized guest stars that populate this show such as Linda Hamilton, Timothy Dalton (check out his interview on what he found unique about this series), and Scott Bakula to name a few.  But it is the regular cast that the real strength of the show.  The characters -- every one -- has depth; you really care for them.  Even what some would call secondary characters like Big Mike, Lester, Jeff, and Anna are anything but written and acted like they are secondary.  The producers and writers did a great job here.

Yvonne Strahovski as Sarah - Chuck's (Zachery Levi) CIA handler and eventual love interest - is absolutely amazing in her ability to convey emotion and feelings through her eyes and facial expressions.  But I also noticed Sarah Lancaster who play's Chuck's sister Ellie is a fine actress in her own right in emotional expression.  Then there is Adam Baldwin as John Casey, NSA agent, who has some of the best one-liners in the show and some very weighty insights.  I could go on but this is getting long enough.

Honestly, I look at what is offered today on TV/Cable and the majority are hard pressed to match Chuck's quality of story and character development.  So much today is dark in nature and though Chuck has some dark times it is balanced with it's comedy, love, a well developed characters, and fun plots.  You will NOT be bored.

One other thing to keep in mind: the show does develop over time and if you are like me it seems to happen too fast in certain aspects.  But I had to remind myself that I can easily watch all shows back to back to back forgetting that I am cramming 5 seasons (5 years worth) in a very short time.  So come join the Chuck fan base.  My wife loves the show just as much as I do and I plan on telling others.  Zachery Levi wants to do a 2 hour Chuck movie which is needed (the entire cast is on board with this; they want to do it).  I hope though that he does more though like what the Duffer brothers have done with Stranger Things.  The more Chuck the better.",1508284800,7,2709,4.354581673306773
5071787,5,B007AFS0N2,"I bought all 5 seasons, so of course I love it. ;)  Everything was in perfect condition, and I was pleasantly surprised to find bonus features on every disc of every season.",1507852800,,173,4.40625
5071788,3,B007AFS0N2,"the blu ray set is perfect, except for season 1 and 5 which they use real thin and flimsy cases, I replaced them with my own sturdier made blu ray cases. The discs are in great shape, the video is very clear, menus pop up right away. The Audio is in DTS-HD true surround. Good bass and full extend of the audio range from highs to lows. The extras are a bit thin, but ok. The ending of the series is OK, could have been done alot better, the ending is your typical ending of todays 5 year or longer series, much like Alias is and this just a rework of that kind of spy show, I could see the similarities for both series. I truly believe the last show of season 4 would have been a better way to end the show than what they did on season 5 finale. I did not care at all of the Sarah they portrayed on the last 2 esp. of season 5, she was much like and even more of a stuck up no emotional spy than even she was at the 1st show of season 1. While I still like the show when I I rewatch it again I will just end my watching at the end of season 4, thats how the show have ended for Sarah and Chuck, IMO",1507075200,,1099,3.782608695652174

5071798,5,B007AFS0N2,"I love this show. I first watched it on Netflix about a year ago, but stopped after just a few episodes of S1 because I thought the plot was stupid. I decided to give it a 2nd try recently ... got hooked this time, have been binge-watching nonstop! Yes the plot has many holes, but the show is really enjoyable, IMO one of the best in its category. It is light-hearted, has a good mix of romance, action, drama, and plenty of laughs. Unlike some comedy, the laughs are not forced at all. All the actors (lead & supporting) chosen for this show are spot on, the screen chemistry is amazing, making you really like to believe the story is real and cheer for the characters  I guess this is why the weak plot doesnt bother me anymore, in fact, the flaws in storyline has now become fun facts to watch.

At the beginning of season 3 I decided to buy the whole Blu-ray set, it is absolutely worth it. Now the Blu-ray quality has a lot to be desired: the picture is grainy in certain scenes, and sound in plain DTS rather than HDMA for the first 3 seasons. I don't think the Blu-ray quality is too much better than HD streaming of Netflix and Amazon (I have watched Chuck using both services), I guess this has something to do with the age of the show. But the bottom line is: NONE of this will bother you if you are a fan.

One question I do have is: WHY JUST 5 SEASONS?

Btw, I am watching the Blu-ray on my PS4 Pro, I can testify that all the Blu-ray functions are working correctly. It is very easy to choose episodes/add-ons, set up A/V, captions, pause/forward/skip, access root menu, etc., there is even an on-screen mapping of each button. The only small bug I found is that when you pause the show, the screen saver won't be activated automatically. I see some reviews complaining about the Blu-ray features being non-existent, I guess there might be some compatibility issues with older systems, but it is not entirely fair to put all blame on this set.",1501545600,3,1957,4.368131868131868
5071799,4,B007AFS0N2,"We LOVE the Chuck series but I cannot give this 5 stars, due to the formatting.

What showed as a decent blu-ray picture on 1080 that's turned into a grainy mess on the 4k. Had to pump down the sophisticated settings on mpeg, blur, dejutter and noise just to settle down the grain.

Chuck is a witty, silly, sometimes irreverent look into international espionage. Chuck is an innocent tech support guy at a place that is hilariously similar to a mobile tech team embedded in a well-known electronics store. Though they take pains to ensure they are not that store, it is obvious what store they are parodying.

The presentation is family friendly, though some of the humor is definitely appropriate for teen and above.

The story unfolds into a rich tapestry of history and reveals as the seasons progress.

5071875,1,B007AFS0N2,"I love Chuck and decided to purchase the DVDs when Netflix dropped it.  I purchased the Blu-Ray collection. The format is TERRIBLE. As far as I can tell there is no menu. You have to watch all the episodes - they just follow one after the other.  The only reason I knew there were dvd extras is because it said so on the packaging, but I couldn't find them (again, no menu).  Finally, I just kept fast forwarding through the million Warnings in every language on earth and lo and behold there were the dvd extras tacked on at the very end. If you pause and go away and the blu-ray player turns off you have to fast forward through entire disc and again fast forward through the Warnings to find the extras!!!! As i said, it's a wonderful show - I'm a real fan of Chuck - BUT impossible to view easily without an episode menu. (Note: some nice person commented that one can press pop up menu to access dvd menu and that does work for first two seasons, but not after that - see below):

Update:  The format has gotten even worse.  Every season has a different format. Finally in season three there is a menu when the dvd first begins, but it is never to be seen again.  One usually presses Episodes instead of Play All so that the format menu after each episode will allow one to click on deleted scenes or commentary, etc.  but with this set of dvds pressing Episodes is same as pressing Play All and the pop up menu doesn't work in this case. One has to start dvd from beginning to access the special features which for my dvd player means I have to turn machine off, eject disc and put it in again and start up machine (again pop up doesn't work as it did for seasons one and two). It is the same in series four, but even worse - when one pauses the dvd and comes back after the blu-ray player turns off, one finds that the dvd has not been paused (it is not set to where one left off watching). One has to start at the very beginning of the dvd and find the episode and one's  place in the episode - every single time!!!!  I really wish that Netflix had not dropped Chuck as it is a show one wants to watch more than once and these dvds are so cumbersome I can see why one would just stick to streaming and not buy dvds anymore if all are like this.",1479513600,9,2252,4.132723112128146

The box set doesn't have any extra bonus content from the stand alone season sets, but it does take up less space since each season is in a single blu-ray case. Image quality is only slightly better than the DVDs, so unless you're a die-hard fan like me, you might want to pass on the Blu-ray.",1476403200,3,571,4.345794392523365

5071888,5,B007AFS0N2,"I won't review the show other than to say that Chuck is my favorite show of all time.  What I would like to do is review the quality of this Blu-ray set.
First off, I watched and enjoyed both the first run Chuck episodes on HD-TV and then on regular dvd for many watches.  One of the reasons I never purchased the Blu-ray version was because of all the bad reviews about the quality.  Ok, what you need to know is that Chuck was filmed on 16mm film, meaning it is a smaller negative that will show the grain more, not only when blown up (larger TV's especially) but also in low light situations.  This is a bit obvious on the regular DVD version, but is a bit more obvious on the Blu-ray.  Is that good or bad?  Well, neither really.  What it is, is a trade off.  What you get on the BD is a sharper image (although sometimes a bit inconsistent) and more saturated colors (although the dvd looks very good in that regards too).  So, bottom line, is it better to get the Blu over the DVD?  I would say definitely yes, especially since the BD set or individual seasons can be had for about the same price as the DVD's.  Now, if they were twice the price, you might want to reconsider, but for now, go Blu all the way.",1470355200,,1215,4.14957264957265

It was an action  adventure; romantic, comedy romp that never fails to pull the viewer along and just have fun enjoyable time!  The cast is fantastic, as are the production crew and the shows get better with each season.  Visually, Chuck is a feast that the viewer can enjoy and still be entertained as each disc is played and completed.  The viewer watches Chuck mature (seasons 1  5) and get the privilege to walk alongside the entire cast as they go through so many different life events and harrowing adventures.  When the fifth and final season was over, it is almost a downer.  Regardless, this is one of the best production programs that NBC ever aired.  Kudos to all those who fought to help keep this program alive and on the air and all those who helped film and produce Chuck.  GREAT JOB!  Fantastic purchase, thanks and enjoy!",1464220800,2,939,4.63030303030303

5071902,5,B007AFS0N2,"We love this series.. fun!  Without spoilers, season five I would skip...  writers tried too hard to cram a bunch of stuff into the last few episodes and ruined the story in my opinion...  Find a spot at the end of season 4, stop.  I would say where, but that would lead to spoilers.  Otherwise a great series.

And Firefly fans, you get Adam Baldwin (Jayne) playing almost the same character except smarter.. and you get a camio from River Tam (Summer Glau) in the series along with many other big name actors who are all fun to see....",1458432000,4,537,4.373737373737374
5071903,5,B007AFS0N2,Loved this series.  Good price for it.,1458259200,,38,4.428571428571429
5071904,4,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck succeeds at a level that for me was unexpected. Forget the story. Look at the characters.

Here's the scoop. Chuck works at the ""Buy More"" (think Best Buy) as a computer nerd. He was expelled from Stanford for something he didn't do and his girlfriend abandoned him for his best friend. Said best friend shows up years later and zaps a highly classified computer database directly into Chuck's noodle. Now he becomes an asset for both the CIA and NSA as an agent from each organization is assigned to protect him from all the nogoodnicks who will be after him for his brain.

The spy parts of the episodes are ludicrous. You can't believe them for a second. But the characters make this shine. First is Chuck (Zachary Levi) who is the reluctant hero. He's a likable guy, living with his sister. They care dearly for each other because their parents took a hike when they were still young. Then there's his female handler Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). She's the beautiful agent who, against her better judgement, finds herself falling for Chuck. Then there's the goofy lot he works with at the Buy More. They add a lot of flavor to the mix. It's the interaction of this mixed bag of people that makes this happen. On one end you have the cold calculation of espionage. On the other end are a group of misfits who rely on each other to make their days whole.

The first two seasons really worked for me, but I might beg off during season three. Chuck has gone from asset to full blown agent and it's starting to wear thin. I suppose the producers couldn't keep up the same schtick and had to make a move. I'm not certain this move worked but, at the same time, I'm not certain where they would go with it. So.....all I can say is watch this as long as it makes you happy. It ran for five seasons so some folks stuck with it. When it starts to fade, just bid it farewell.",1457136000,,1878,4.406340057636887
5071905,3,B007AFS0N2,Quality was of the disc was good. It came in box with all seasons in there own disc cases. But the reason for 3 stars is that when you insert the disc after the commercials it starts playing the show automatically. I went to the menu and there is no place where the episodes are listed out so you can select which one you want to watch. So if you watch one or two shows and then insert the disc later you just have to fast forward to get to where you left off. Not fun..,1456444800,16,470,3.90625

I was sad to see it go, but ecstatic that the show was able to go out on its own terms. I've seen that some people are upset that it's simply a repackaging of the separate seasons and that there's no new content. While I agree that new content would have been awesome, I'm not going to dock a star for that. It was one of the most underrated shows on TV. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",1449187200,,530,4.29

I'll never buy anything for you people again. I'm VERY displeased. If I haven't payed and waited so much already I'd definately demand a refund.

The series are great, my favorite. This show (and the costumer) shouldn't be treated like this. Maybe that's why it went from $89 to $56,99 in a few weeks...",1444089600,18,552,4.51

Turned out that disc 4 in season 4 is defective and appears to have no video on it, despite attempts to play it in multiple locations.  It's extremely disappointing in a professionally made set like this.  I don't see any place on Amazon to just contact them about it, so this will have to do.  I don't think there's anything they can do about it, anyway.  The purchase was made nearly 18 months ago.  We'll have to watch for season 4 in a second hand store, I guess.

The pop-up box where the cast/crew are discussing different scenes shows up as the scene is playing, but I can't get the audio for the commentary.  Tried everything.  New Blu ray player with all firmware upgrades so it's not an issue with compatibility, as far as I can tell.  And can't find any settings or options on the disc menu itself to switch audio feed.

5071978,5,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck is my favorite television series of all time - even before my love of Maggie Lawson of Psych and Zooey Deschanel of New Girl. It took me a month or so to complete the series through Netflix. It's disappointing that I never followed the show on its initial airing. Because apparently, Subway saved the series from being cancelled and it would've been good to support the journey.

In comparison to other television shows, Chuck sticks out because of the extensive development of every main and supporting character on the show. We see Chuck, someone who was kicked out of college, still living with his sister and her boyfriend, and working at the Buy More - which is essentially the show's definition of a Best Buy. Over time, he becomes a veteran spy, earns the respect of Casey (if you didn't shed a tear when they hugged, you're not human), and develops a relationship with Sarah.

We see Sarah and Casey, both of whom are trained not to care - not to fall in love. Casey leaves behind his daughter and his wife, both of whom are thinking he is dead. He progressively builds a relationship back with his daughter and even develops a kinky relationship towards the end of the show that truly develops the Casey the viewers were waiting to see. Sarah, despite everything everyone important has told her, follows her heart and becomes human again.

In my opinion though, Chuck should've kept Hannah while he had her. It's not everyday you meet a goddess on an airplane.

Nonetheless, we see Morgan, who starts off in the same boat as Chuck with an obsession of his sister, but eventually progresses to an assistant manager, manager, spy, intersect, and boyfriend (of Casey's daughter, ironically). We see Ellie and Awesome's progression slightly throughout but on the final episode is where they finally let Chuck go and decide it is time to move on and basically run a hospital in Michigan.

To me, the fact that we see the progression of each character throughout the entire series made me feel somewhat attached to each character and what they brought to the table - even Jeffster!

If you're looking for a series worth binge-watching, this is it.",1414108800,6,2156,4.736
5071979,3,B007AFS0N2,"I absolutely love this series! BUT... I am an avid dvd collector and often wait for the ""complete series"" box sets. This one was rather disappointing as a collection.

To Whom it may concern:

DO better!! For a multi-billion dollar per year industry, which is based on what fans think, say and do, you should treat us better.

I was expecting a condensed version of the entire series, something that took up less shelf space than the seasons separately. I didn't get that. I did grasp that there were no extra special features, so I wasn't expecting that, but still. What you get if you order this is exactly the seasons as you would buy them separately, except they slide into a little sleeve/box contraption. Save your money, buy them individually.",1407542400,2,599,4.714285714285714
5072006,5,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck is a fabulous series.  The action is excellent.  The stories are mostly great.  The comedy is excellent and mostly isn't cheap and doesn't rely on sexual innuendo or other cheap devices.  The characters including most of the guests are great!

But the heart of Chuck is the Chuck and Sarah love story and the growing and maturing of the Chuck, Sarah and Casey friendship, interdependency and mutual respect (Something like the Aubrey Maturin series).  People that go through all 91 episodes would do well to focus on those two themes.  It is interesting that while the friendship, interdependency and mutual friendship of the three continuously grow, the Chuck and Sarah love story has its ups and downs.

Chuck is complex but you can ignore the complexity if you like, just like many good books.  For example, there is another theme where Sarah starts out as a spy at the beginning of the series but her nature wants to pull her toward a ""normal life"" while Chuck starts out as a ""normal"" nerd but his nature pulls him toward being a spy.  And this is just one example, if you go through all 91 episodes you will see others.  Also, many will find the music especially interesting.

Some people find many of the Buy Moreian segments as crude or boring or not interesting.  If you are one, just FF through them.  Since the Buy More lives and the CIA/NSA spy lives rarely are interdependent this will probably not significantly degrade the 90% of Chuck which is spy related.

I feel very lucky to have found this series as I never saw one episode live.  Hopefully others will have the good fortune to discover this series as I did.",1406592000,,1635,4.625

If it weren't for the outcry from the public (and the fact NBC had nothing else to offer) plus a lot of help from Subway for season there would not have been a Season 3. Probably the best of the five seasons. Probably the most interesting character Brandon Routh character Daniel Shaw. He went from an All-American hero to a bitter traitor once he learned the truth about his wife's death. A tragic character .The my least favorite scene was when Ellie watches her father being murdered in front of her.  In Season we meet Chuck's mother and learn the reason why she left her family. Plus the second most interesting character in Timothy Dalton's character Alexi Volkoff . I was disappointed in Season 5 and the way the series was wrapped up. It was interesting to learn more about John Casey past and the introduction of his daughter Alex in season three.

5072012,5,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck me, where do I begin! How do I write a recommendation for the best TV show I have ever seen, when I know that even so, not everyone will like it? It is also hard to describe since it is so funny yet not a sit-com, action-packed yet not just an action show, poignant yet not a drama and while it has a Sci-Fi premise, it is not really Sci-Fi. It does seamlessly blend all of these elements, however. The scripts are mostly superb, awesome even. The Emmy award-winning action sequences are also great, despite the low budget. The acting from both the two leads and all the supporting cast is flawless. All the characters evolve and grow through each of the seasons and you come to care for them all, even the Buy More characters that may initially annoy.

Perhaps it would help to try and say what Chuck might be made from, and if you like any of these ingredients, you may also like Chuck. Start with a generous helping of True Lies and blend it with Red and all the Sean Connery James Bond movies. Add some Big Bang Theory and then go back to the 60s and add a teaspoon each of Mission Impossible, Get Smart and The Avengers (the one with Steed and Mrs. Peel, not the superheroes). Mix thoroughly in a bowl forged from Casablanca orOK Im a guy so Im struggling a bit with this one, insert whatever love story you relate to... Because what makes Chuck better than all of the movies and shows that it could be compared to, is its heart. The Chuck and Sarah love story, and the amazing acting by Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski that makes you believe it, lifts Chuck above all other TV shows I have ever seen. Sometimes the nerd gets the girl.

My only regret is that I started watching this on Netflix long after the show had been cancelled. I would have happily bought a hundred foot-longs, for just one more episode. So trust me, don't freak out, join the Nerd Herd and unleash the Casey. Be prepared to laugh it up but have time available to watch it all the way through and then start again from the beginning.

How the ""usual guy"" brings back the ""human side"" to hardened agents, who then start to look at things with a wider perspective. How unusual means solve seemingly impossible situations. And how the characters try to live their usual lives alongside their spy lives, where personal relations, friendships and family present at times more complicated situations then the arms dealers and international spies.

My only personal gripe is the final episode, would have wanted to see some sort of closure. Maybe the creators left it open so that a movie can one day pick up from that spot and then complete everything? We can hope. Because else it was just a bad ending.",1397088000,5,930,4.8125

He has stayed up late since this set arrived watching every ep again and then watching it with me once more when I have time to watch with him.
It's a funny show with endearing characters.  It does NOT take itself, or the spy-genre, seriously which is really funny.  It's full of Easter Eggs which I really enjoy, and all the nerdy/geeky references are really hilarious. I feel like if I knew ""Chuck"" and ""Morgan"" in RL, we'd be total buds. Also, ""Captain Awesome"" is pretty awesome...and inspirational.  Great, uplifting show.",1389744000,4,825,4.510067114093959

It took me about 2-3 weeks to 're-live' the entire 5 years of the show, and it would have been well worth twice the price I paid for the enjoyment. I have read some other reviews complaining about the simple packaging. I have never been a collector of memorabilia, so I can't really address that issue...to me it was about the enjoyment of the show and not about the packaging.

I have enjoyed the wacky plots and adventures of the motley cast of characters they have assembled for this series.  The basic premise is a bit far fetched (downloading a computer into a human brain?) but I just accepted it and enjoyed the show.  If you demand technical accuracy this show is not for you.  However, if you want some fun with a bunch of awkward geeks, mixed in with some super spies you will really enjoy this show as I have.

Sound and picture quality are fine though.  It's nice seeing some of the deleted scenes and extras that I had never seen before.

The characters are well written and make you care about them and what happens to them, this is helped immensely by the actors who play them. The chemistry between the two leads (Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski) is amazing. Yes the storyline a can be a little ott but they are fun - if you want a serious show then watch Alias.
The Bluray itself is great, although there are not many extras compared to the DVD which is disappointing.

  The bad : Each case cover was made differently.  Looks like they bundled each individual season all together and threw them into a box to call it a collectors set.

The concept is complex and refined blending a great mix of comedy and drama and though it's often incredibly outrageous, anyone who has worked in big-box retail can tell you that the pathetic mess of people working at the Buy More is squared on truth. There's a lot of sexuality in this, but nothing that made watching it with my teenager (Or my wife) too uncomfortable. My wife likes it because Sarah generally wears sensible shoes to chase down bad guys, not high heels or wedges. I don't really care about that. Words of warning. If you are sensitive about being of short or average height, find something else. Three of the main characters are 6'4"". Sara's 5'10"". Morgan, at 5'7"" looks like he's part of the lollipop club. No, I don't know what I mean by that but I somehow believe that I made my point.

Instead it just wants to play them all in order without a true menu option.

All it is is a thin cardboard type box that holds the five seasons, in their original cases when they are sold separately.  The only thing good about this is you can get it cheaper than buying the seasons individually.

Granted I'm not complaining much because it was a deal, even if I already had the first season on dvd; however, it irks me that they could call this a ""Collectors Set"".

5072102,4,B007AFS0N2,"""Chuck"" spent its entire five year run on NBC on the verge of cancellation, saved year after year by a small but vocal and dedicated fan base that appreciated the show's unique blend of comedy, action, and romance.  The series featured Chuck Bartkowski as a slacker computer nerd at an L.A. box store, whose life changed dramatically after a secret database called the Intersect was emplanted in his brain by a rogue agent.  Suddenly, the bumbling Chuck was leading a double life, working at the BuyMore Electronics Store by day and as a secret agent by night.  Beautiful CIA Agent Sarah Walker was his handler and bodyguard, assisted by hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey.  The reluctant Chuck was drawn into a world of secrets, spies, and terorists, endangering himself and his unknowing friends and extended family.

Chuck was always a reluctant hero, but he always tried to do the right thing, something that endeared him to audiences and to his co-workers.  Over the seasons, Chuck and Team Bartkowski got progressively tougher assignments and foiled a long string of wonderfully nefarious guest villains.  Chuck's extended family, including sister Ellie and future brother in law Captain Awesome, long missing relatives, and co-workers like best buddy Morgan, were drawn into Chuck's secret.  The show always managed to find the humor in Chuck's situations, while ripping off the best of any number of storylines from television and movies.

At the center of the show was the long simmering romance between Chuck and Sara, a romance that followed a difficult road and eventually came full circle at the conclusion of the show.  If you've seen it, you'll want to see it again.  If you haven't, you have something to look forward to.  Highly recommended to fans of the show.",1363305600,,1783,5.0067796610169495
5072103,4,B007AFS0N2,"Sure, Chuck deserves a much more collector edition but I don't really care about the extras, the show is worth it on his own, so I'm happy we can afford it on blu-ray.

The picture isn't always good on HD, different cameras used during the shooting i guess, but nothing to be ashamed, it's a common fact for tv shows.

The show has his good and bad moments but the whole story is a pleasure to rewatch. I always feel connected with Chuck, he reflects my fears, dreams and the wish to move on with my life. Still looking for my Sarah thought.",1362182400,6,541,4.242718446601942

5072105,5,B007AFS0N2,"Chuck was/is an amazing show. If you have never seen an episode, then I will warn you, be prepared to spend a lot of time in fron of your tv. Its so addicting. The characters are all so charasmatic, they are all so likeable, they are all so important to this show. The show is filled with action, adventure, humor, pop culture refrences, romance, and heart. There is so much heart. It's a feel good, enjoyable, entertaining must have for tv fans. Seriously, we were for raving fan base for one reason. This show was too good for people to not be watching. It's sad, that people tuned in for Dancing with the stars when this was just a click away. If you are wondering why fans are giving this completer series a 1 star rating its the PACKAGING - NOT THE SHOW. Warner Brothers initially was charging 239 for the complete series while giving the fans NOTHING extra. It was cheaper to buy the individual seasons. The current 130 price on amazon is a good price.

If you are seriously considering buying this, I highly suggest you do. You'll have a smile on your face after watching, and everything in the world will right itself!",1360108800,3,1126,4.466019417475728

Im glad i had the pleasure being able to enjoy not only the characters who are all lovable in their own way, but the amazing music (for all you indie rock lovers, such as myself), the cult movie and video game references, the none stop action, comedy and at times engrossing drama.  It has been a pleasure to have been shown that world!  They really don't do too many gems like Chuck these days.  So buy it! You won't be disappointed!",1359763200,,513,4.268041237113402

5072117,2,B007AFS0N2,"SPOILER ALERT (if you've not seen the entire series) AHEAD

I really loved the Chuck series.

The story of Charles Irving Bartowski and his girlfriend turned wife Sarah Walker and their friends and family tickled the funny-bone and told a fine story about family, friends and obligation. While the show didn't change lives, it did change how we looked about the way we support our favorite shows.

Chuck was always teetering on the brink of cancellation and the die-hard fans of the show not only wrote NBC to keep the show on the air but they also spent their money supporting the sponsors of the show. This and cost-cutting moves by the producers of the show made it financial feasible to keep Chuck on the air. We bout Chuck merchandise and the DVDs and Blurays. A very creative fan posted the unofficial Chuck Soundtrack along with CD art for the rest of us to assemble.

So, with many of the Chucksters already owning all 5 seasons on DVD/Bluray, WB released the complete Chuck boxset. Here's the problem. There was nothing special for the fan who spends the $150 or so to buy the set, save a nifty box. Not good enough.

Warner Bros. spend millions of dollars on marketing for other projects, so why such a generic presentation? Other posters have articulated ideas on how to properly reward the fans who shell out their hard-earned bucks for the set. All they would have had to do was ask the fans. We're pretty easy to find. They showed up every year at ComiCon. They patrol the fan sites and they're surprisingly articulate.

I strongly recommend you stay away from this product until it becomes as special as the series.",1353110400,64,1630,4.642361111111111
