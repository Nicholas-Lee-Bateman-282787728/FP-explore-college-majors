However, there isn't any subtitles if you required them.",1426377600,,127,4.291666666666667
8661354,5,B00KTFJ6HE,"Get ready to get your fashion on with these great new episodes to Littlest Pet Shop. My girls have been a fan of Littlest Pet Shop since it first came out as a toy, so when the cartoon series came out, they were definitely enamored and loved it. You get a great mix of characters and writing that will bring you, and your kids, back for more every time. On this DVD you get to continue having some great interactions with the characters and you will laugh and have fun engaging with the characters in these new ways. All-in-all these were great episodes. I only wish there were more than the five that were here as my girls will always enjoy more of these!
