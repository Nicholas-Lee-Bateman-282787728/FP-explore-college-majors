7545571,5,B018FK66TU,"As a huge Star Wars fan, I was uncertain how I felt about it this movie before AND after seeing it. But after talking with others, discussing the movie, I've realized that this is one of the most amazing, beautifully made movies of all time. The beauty is so subtle sometimes, if you are prepared to judge it, you'll miss it.

Amazing.",1450396800,6,335,4.403225806451613
7545572,5,B018FK66TU,"Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars from time to time.  And thankfully, my local AMC had showtimes for Star Wars: The Force Awakens a day early prior to its official release date; so I jumped at the opportunity to get early tickets. This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Starting with the actors, Star Wars The Force Awakens has a star-studded cast. John Boyega, who I have followed since his role in the film Attack the Block, stars as Finn alongside actress Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. They are very likable as the main protagonists, with Finn wanting to leave his life behind as a stormtrooper and Rey being a self-reliant person from the planet Jakku. I also very much enjoyed Oscar Isaac's role as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron; and I hope we see more of his character in the future Star Wars films. It was nice to see the return of characters like Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and seeing Harrison Ford make his return as Han Solo garnered a round of applause from the audience and myself. Andy Serkis stars as Supreme Leader Snoke and does a nice job, while Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma. Domhnall Gleeson makes his character General Hux a memorably vocal antagonist. But perhaps most satisfying of all the characters is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. My friends and I discussed Star Wars: The Force Awakens well before its release, and though our opinions differed, we all agreed that the movie absolutely needed a imposing and memorable villain. And Kylo Ren is just that. I enjoyed how much Star Wars: The Force Awakens explored Kylo's persona and duality; while at the same time giving explanation as to how he came to be just who he is.

The story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens adds new elements but has constant reminders that will delight Star Wars fans(as they did me) of why they are fans of the popular space opera in the first place. JJ Abrams incoporates humor into Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but it works very well. And there are numerous surprises (THAT I WILL NOT SPOIL), and some moments that hit your emotional side.

And even better, the action scenes in the movie are absolutely wonderful. The lightsaber battles are noticeably better here than they were in previous films, and the familiar theme music that we all know and love will definitely be heard in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Taking over the directorial duties for a Star Wars film is no easy task, but JJ Abrams has done an impressive job creating this film.

I'd like to point out that the ONLY problem I had with Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that there were certain characters I would have like to have seen have more screentime. But even still, Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers spectacle, and wonder thanks to the talented cast, the direction of JJ Abrams, and the likable combination of old/new elements to the trilogy.

I am currently writing this review at 12:34 a.m., and I won't be able to get a single ounce of sleep tonight simply because I cannot wait to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens again tomorrow(and at least 3 more times after that). I sincerely hope everyone enjoys Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as I did. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a nice reminder that this is why we go to the movies. And truthfully, I am excited to see where the franchise goes next.

7545574,5,B018FK66TU,I don't think that the people reviewing this movie saw the same film that I did. This movie was monumental & epic. It stayed true to form when it comes to the original trilogy & totally blows the prequel trilogy out of the water. It is awesome and amazing from beginning to end. Kilo Ren was outstanding. Harrison Ford was spot on. The only bad thing I can say is that there were to many comedic moments between characters. I like my star wars movies to be serious if not dark. As a whole this is the best star wars movie next to empire strikes back. Go see this in the theater & experience the new magic that is star wars.,1450310400,13,623,4.1570247933884295

7545576,4,B018FK66TU,"Whats it about?

Two orphans meet in an unlikely series of events that see them fighting forces of evil in the company of a charming smuggler and his giant hairy pet friend.

What did I think?

In a triumphant return to a galaxy far, far away we revisit the fine tradition of a fun space opera. There are a few problems with the story, but frankly, few will care once the familiar theme song starts and finishes what is a well-polished and entertaining new entry. The performances of Harrison Ford and Daisy Ridley are simply captivating and, with more humor this time around, the future looks bright for this beloved franchise. Theres a fine line between homage, respect, and being derivative and there are times it appears Abrams is going out of his way to repeat scenes from A New Hope (both charming and a little irritating) but it makes you feel like youve come home even as you immerse yourself in new politics and adventures. A great romp!",1450310400,4,946,4.585798816568047
7545577,3,B018FK66TU,"Being an avid star wars fan since my childhood, I was looking forward to this new chapter and I watched the 12.01am show with two friends. The film has amazing CGI and plenty of gun fights. It also brings back the obvious characters from the original films, as well as introducing new characters, particularly the orphaned girl Rey and the AWOL storm trooper Finn who play pivotal roles. We have a new sith apprentice and the ultimate sith big boss.

The film also 'borrows' heavily from the original star wars film (a new hope) and also from the phantom menace as certain themes make yet another reappearance. For example, the desolate sand planet Tatooine as Jakku, female version Rey (on Jakku) as young Anakin on Tatooine - both of whom are tech wizards and very gifted with the force but don't know it, yet another new death-star, cool uncle Luke Skywalker hanging up his boots, running away and going into hiding to a galaxy far, far away when his paduwan (Kylo Ren - Han and Liea's son!) turns to the dark side - same thing that happened to Obi Wan!. Just a few examples!. We also see the departure of a particular character.

To be honest, the film does not remain faithful to the original star wars stories. I also found that Kylo Ren didn't have that bad-ass persona of Darth Vader or even Darth Maul (now there is a baddie if I ever saw one).

There are also some glaring inconsistencies in the film, such as the storm troopers are NOT clones!. Also, for hand held blasters don't even scratch a Tie fighter yet they can blow up an X-wing fighter. Wasn't it General Aldraan who said the X-wing was an almost perfect balance of speed, manoeuvrability, fire power and shielding?!.

Overall it was an okay film but it just fell short of the mark by quite some distance. The original star wars films (and even the prequels) had very strong personalities and a sense of direction, yet this new film came across as lost and a plagiarised mish-mash of previous films. It seems JJ Abrams was totally clueless, so he attempted to compensate for the lack of originality by inserting copious amounts of spectacular CGI and then hoping nobody would notice the pit-falls (the automatons did not but the extremely few astute did).

I had high expectation from JJ Abrams as he did a good job on the Star Trek remakes but he shot himself in the foot with this one. Admittedly, I felt very underwhelmed after seeing the film as it could have been so much better (and my friends also felt a little disappointed). Lets hope the next two chapters (which continue the story from this one) will be better (as in the captain america films where the first instalment was a disappointment, but it laid the storyline and characters for the next films which turned out to be much better).

On a related topic, prior to the release of the new 'star wars battlefront' pc/console game, it received a huge amount of hype and advertising yet after release it has turned out to be a big flop. In fact the new game 'Fallout4' despite it's buginess, freezing and other issues actually turned out to be far more popular than SWBF. Reports on Hexus and WCCFTECH said Fallout4 amassed five times more online players than SWBF. So there does seem to be an underlying issue of the latest star wars not delivering the goods.

If you are considering watching this film in the cinema then I would honestly advise you to hang fire and wait for the bluray release (and then rent it out). In my neck of the woods, cinema tickets are costing a ridiculous (12) and in London they are 15-20 per ticket!. I remember back in the 90's when I was a teenager, cinema tickets cost only 3 with a valid NUS card!. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay anything for my ticket as I had a gift voucher which I redeemed for a ticket (sadly, I didn't get a premier seat as the theatre was packed out for the midnight showing). Even then I felt somewhat short-changed.

BTW, I stayed till the very end, anticipating some sort of short clips after the credits but there were none. Also, don't miss the trailers before the film starts. We see trailers for the new Independence Day and Star Trek films (TBR summer 2016) as well as some other potentially very good films that took me by surprise (excluding the presence of the yahud shiksa 'gal gadot' who has utterly ruined the upcoming Batman/Superman film).",1450310400,9,4349,4.566666666666666

What I will say is that the plot makes little to no sense when taking into consideration the other movies.  This movie is one nonsequitor after the next, honestly you need to leave your expectations at the door with this movie and the other ""new"" star wars movies.

There are some people who enjoy it, and good for them.  Honestly I somewhat liked it but I left the movie thinking ""so much of this didn't make any sense.""  After the nostalgia wore off I realized how bad the movies really are.

So if you want to buy this, good for you, have fun, hopefully nostalgia is enough for you.  Hopefully your critical thinking can be ignored long enough to realize it isn't really star wars.",1529107200,,798,4.387755102040816

7545654,2,B018FK66TU,"Our review of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015) directed by J.J. Abrams.

Like everyone else, I was very impressed with JJ Abrams treatment of the new Star Trek films (feat. Chris Pine) and felt that he really showed a great love and respect for the historical canon of the original series, while still managing to tell a fan-fave familiar origins story with a new directorial voice.

Unfortunately, none of those awesome qualities is present in this latest entry to the Star Wars saga. The Force Awakens, lacks the overall quality of the original trilogy and has none of the obvious affinity/affection for the subject matter as shown in his other works. I walked away from Star Trek feeling as though he really loved the sense of adventure and camp of the original series and that enthusiasm showed in the film, however, with the (Abrams entry) Star Wars film, I walked away feeling as though J.J. Abrams did not actually like anything about the original Star Wars series.

To say it was Very disappointing is an understatement. But, unfortunately we are in a place where the new studios know that fans will still want to have these works in their library, and it shows in the poor quality of work. But to be fair, perhaps if the script had been better, the directors job would have been easier.  And again to be fair, I do think the studio did the right thing in taking a break in the story and allowing the writers to reboot while working on the stand alone Rogue One entry (which technically takes place just after episode IV, but well before episode VII) , and it definitely worked out for the better so far. But it will take a little time to get over the disappointment of the Abrams entry.

--
I love the idea of the Star Wars Saga, and was relieved that the Rogue One and Last Jedi entries, (as well as Solo (directed by Ron Howard 2018)-), were definitely more in line with the quality of work that George Lucas & Co. put into the original Trilogy (1977-1983). And hopefully, like Solo, Rogue One and The Last Jedi, any other future entries will follow suit (and continue to fare better than the Abrams film).

If this were just any standalone type sci-fi film I would not buy it, but as it is a part of the larger collection, I feel like to maintain a complete set has historical and sentimental relevance, but it is definitely not as good as the originals or the most recent releases that followed.

Super disappointed. And J. J. Abrams should be super embarrassed.

7545656,3,B018FK66TU,"It is sad to see a great story like this become so second rate. Poor scripts, poor actors, zero plot. I saw the original in 1977 as a child and at the time it was the best, indeed apart from 2001: A Space Odyssey, it was the first. It hasn't aged well. If I was to summarise what is wrong with this movie it would be this - it is too close to the original. The world has moved on. Star Wars 2 & 3 will always be my favourite movies thanks to the excellent story of the origin of Darth Vader and the young actor who played him. So sad, but it was good whilst it lasted. Star Wars 2/3 breathed some new life into an old story.

Seems like the star wars franchise has just become a licence to print money. Make any old rubbish, slap the star wars name on it and watch the money come in.

EDIT: after the third watch I have to revise my original review. After lowering my expectations (which you need to do with this movie) I am beginning to enjoy it. Although I don't like where the story is going, the first-order is pretty cool, and the new Darth Vader wannabe is not bad either. If only he left the mask on with the cool voice. When viewed as a Star Wars episode IV remake (which it would seem to be) it is an enjoyable watch.",1526515200,,1226,4.0

Also, why is the most hopeful, brave and diligent hero of all time found here cowering alone in an emo depression? What happened to Luke since saving the galaxy from evil? So between Jedi and here... Luke fails as a person.

Also, Han and Leia, our previously beloved Star Wars heroic couple... oh yeah, they failed too. Seperated. Also, they failed as parents.

What the heck? Why is it that Disney absolutely has no hope in them? Why would the film-makers pick up the Skywalker and Solo stories with the set up of ""everyone's a failure now""?

7545785,2,B018FK66TU,"To me, this movie is extremely flawed. I have a hunch that if the same story had been told without the ""Star Wars"" name attached, it would've been panned by everyone. The problems with this movie are pretty deep. Here are some off the top of my head:

- Pacing/story: In Episode IV, the Death Star plays a significant role in the movie. We're introduced to it organically as Leia is taken there after being captured; we see inside it, learn about it, and finally see it destroyed over the entire course of the movie. In Episode VII, about halfway through the movie with absolutely no warning or anything, the movie basically just goes ""oh yeah and there's another Death Star and now it's blowing up all these planets."" It was jarring. It feels like the writers were working from a particularly creative 8 year old's stream-of-consciousness imagining of what the next Star Wars movie should be like, complete with non-sequiturs and things that are ""cool"" but which don't really add to the core of the movie in any meaningful way except to make us go ""OMG LOOK, it's the MILLENNIUM FALCON!! Remember that from the other movies??"" Repeat about a dozen times as pointless characters/call backs are thrown into the mix.

- Ray. It took Luke years to learn how to do basic things with the force, and Ray learns it all in literally about a day. Sure, fans will make up some theories to explain this away, but in the end it's just an excuse for lazy storytelling.

- The ending. I guess the 8-year-old who laid out the basic plot for the movie added, ""oh yeah and at the end have R2D2 wake up and fix everything!"" What the heck was that?",1520035200,,1629,4.5152542372881355

7545793,2,B018FK66TU,"The first thing I said about Lucas' sale to Disney:  ""He sold out to the Dark Side.""  Disney did as expected: write the story it wanted, without regard to Lucas' plans, and put people like J.J. Abrams (who probably salivated over the chance to get his paws on this series) in charge, and slowly but steadily kill off our original, beloved characters so it can do whatever it wants with the ""Star Wars"" universe.  The second:  ""Can they come up with an uglier, worse hairstyle for Princess Leia?"" (Yes again.  Jackie Kennedy if she'd been born in a trailer park in a galaxy far, far away.)

The movie isn't quite as bad as expected.  Rey is at least interesting (if you don't mind waiting almost an hour to see a familiar, beloved character).  I don't buy Han and Leia having such a spoiled kid as Ben/Kylo Ren.  COME ON!!!!  Han would knock a bratty kid on his behind and have Chewie sit on him before he could even get started on tantrums like that!  Luke desert his best friend AND his sister?  Not a chance.  Han and Leia split up? No....people who love each other don't leave each other alone and in danger in the REAL ""Star Wars"" universe.

As someone who saw the original ""Star Wars"" before it was Episode 4 and when Han shot first, who saw it over 100 times (quit counting after that), I'm sorrier than I can say to have been right.  Well, they obviously counted on the fact that the original fans, who have stayed on this adventure since it began forty years ago, dying off soon anyway.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

Five MESMERIZING Stars. The partnership of LucasFilm Ltd and Walt Disney Studios led to the virtual re-launching of the Stars Wars film universe with the excellent, inaugural Episode VII, here presented on Amazon video as Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Plus Bonus Features). And it is a blockbuster, $2 Billion+ hit. The two that followed, the standalone Rogue One and Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, also topped a billion dollars, but this movie exceeded all movies to this time, except Avatar (and Gone With The Wind, they say).

Even with the same old-same old galactic conflict, the producers have created captivating, new, younger, psychologically-conflicted protagonists with personal ties to the past episodes: a new bad guy, a character new to the updated Rebellion, a new robot, one unusual addition, and some heavyweight holdovers from the past. After the initial introduction of the new bad guy, and two new rebel protagonists, the central Rey character appears and bonds with the new robot almost immediately, setting up the rest of the movie, with has great fight scenes, space and land battles, escape and evasion, and CGI scenes, as she keeps bedeviling the Empire (Whos the girl?) and continues her personal journey. Directed by J.J. Abrams and starring Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Anthony Daniels, Peter Hayhew, Andy Serkis, Domhnal Gleeson, Lupita Nyongo, Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie, Ken Leung, many others, and the handful of surprise cameos and longer parts that are the icing on this Star Wars cake, as is the inspired John Williams score. The bonus features are excellent, containing informative insights, extended deleted scenes, and some bittersweet moments and farewells such as Secrets of The Force Awakens. Kudos to the leadership of Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams. Highly Recommended. Five FANTASTIC Stars. (LucasFilm Ltd. Bad Robot. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Rated-Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

7545857,2,B018FK66TU,"First, this isn't a real Star Wars film; it's a Disney movie.  Second, it isn't a very good movie.  When I went to see it, I wanted to like it.  I came away from it thinking, ""Well . . .""

Han Solo's  death came as a shock, and I mean that exactly as it sounds.  The viewers are not prepared for his murder; he is disposed of as casually as though he were a person of no importance instead of a major hero of the old Rebellion.  His meaningless death was a blow from which the film never recovered.

The whole movie shows every sign of being hastily and poorly written, with great gaping holes in logic throughout, as if the Disney people couldn't wait to wash their hands of the whole Star Wars ethos.  After thirty years (actually forty), Leia is still battling the remnants of the Empire and defending the weak New Republic.  She never in her life has gotten to be anything but a freedom fighter, slowing down just long enough to bear Han Solo one child.  Han illogically returns to his old career as a smuggler, though the New Republic and Leia need his services terribly.  Luke, following the murders of his Jedi students by his renegade nephew, has simply given up and disappeared, no one knows where, even though he, too, is badly needed.  By the way, does it make sense, after all these decades, that Luke is still the only Jedi in the galaxy?  What was to stop him from taking on more students after ""Kylo Ren"" fled to his dark mentor, Snoke?  Luke's actions are completely out of character.  He is not a quitter, but Disney insists on portraying him as one.

Apparently nothing of note has gone on in the galaxy since the end of ""Return of the Jedi"", according to this film.  The characters have not grown, had other adventures, or advanced  in any way except in years.  It's no wonder that the dialogue is stilted and performances by the principles weak--there is simply nothing of interest to narrate.  It's unbelievable that the war with the Empire, aka The First Order, could have dragged on this long, just as it's unbelievable that Luke is still the only Jedi.  Disney has simply frozen the characters and action in time, maybe hoping that viewers and fans won't notice.

New characters are neither very interesting nor compelling.  Rey comes the closest to being a three-dimensional character, but even she is hard to believe, flying the Millennium Falcon out of Jakku when she has never flown in her life, and using the Force like a pro when she has never been trained.  When they battle, she nearly demolishes Kylo Ren, a feat which Luke Skywalker apparently couldn't accomplish.

The billion-dollar Star Wars logo--the Brooklyn Bridge that George Lucas sold--can't lift this mediocre effort out of the cellar, because it isn't a real Star Wars film--it's a Disney movie.  These are the people who haven't turned out a classic film since the great Walt Disney died.  These are the folks who think they can buy a cultural icon like Star Wars and then crank out space operas one-tenth as good--and have no one notice the difference.

Well, I noticed, and for that reason I won't be patronizing anymore of these sad knock-offs.",1515888000,,3143,4.60251798561151

I said it was overrated, not bad. The title is clickbait. I liked Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Its a good film. Its just not a GREAT film. I think it largely deserves the positive reviews its getting, but I don't understand the gush. Perhaps the fans are thrilled to finally see a worthwhile sequel to the beloved original trilogy. I was, certainly, but it doesnt negate the major problems with the film, which Ill discuss in the Cons section of my review.

A little about my fanboy cred: Ive been a HUGE Star Wars fan ever since I was a little boy. My parents still have a home video of me spouting on and on about Luke Skywalker. My dad kept asking me other questions to change the subject, but I only wanted to talk Star Wars. I remember the excitement in anticipation for Episodes I, II, and III, regardless of the many flaws in those movies. (I kept hoping that the next one would be good, but unfortunately it didn't happen.) Regardless of my disdain for the prequels, Im still a fan to this day.

As I said, I liked the movie. Star Wars Episode VII has a lot going for it, so Ill touch on the positives first. Please note that the following will contain spoilers, so consider yourself warned. Already seen the movie? Then please continue.
Star Wars: Pros

  The directing/editing. J.J. Abrams knows how to direct action, and thankfully he went light on the lens flares. The pacing is really tight; not a single sequence drags on or is rushed. The shot compositions and camera work are a marked improvement over the prequels. Theres a video clip of the producer of the prequels saying, Theres so much going on in every frame as if thats a positive thing. A skilled director/editor will know when to clutter the frame and when to use minimalism for impact. Abrams and his team have done this.
  The action. One of the many, many problems with Episodes I-III is they are boring. Most of the run time is spent in exposition. An old film making rule is show, don't tell. George Lucas completely abandoned this principle when making the prequels. Lucky for us, Abrams showed us the action. Stuff happens in this movie, and the audience is trusted to fill in the blanks. Quite a few sequences are very exciting. The Millennium Falcon outmaneuvering a TIE fighter immediately comes to mind. The battle at the temple is well-shot and has a couple tense fights. The lightsaber fight, while problematic story-wise (see below), is very well-shot and tightly edited. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
  The humor. The original Star Wars movies are funny, and not because Jar Jar Binks steps in shit and says, Poodoo. The humor in the original trilogy (OT) comes from the tension between characters and how they're handling tough situations. The Force Awakens is like this. The banter between Han and Chewie is often laugh out loud funny. BB-8s thumbs up moment got a big laugh, as well. I laughed when Han kept calling Finn Big Deal. The humor is kid-friendly, but not childish.
  The visual effects. The movie is gorgeous to look at. A big deal was made over the fact that Abrams used location shots and practical effects wherever he could. The movie is an improvement for doing so. Actors can react to a physical object much better than a tennis ball on a stick. Where CGI characters were used, motion capture was the method of choice. Maz Kanata is seamlessly integrated, for example. One of the best effects scenes, in my opinion, is the scene in the first ten minutes where Kylo Ren stops a blaster shot in mid-air. Weve never seen something like that before and the FX department did a beautiful job.
  The old cast. It was a lot of fun to see Han, Luke, and Leia. I cant wait to get a lot more Luke in Episode VIII. Harrison Fords Han Solo steals the show. As I mentioned, his banter with Chewie is great. Oh, you're cold? was my favorite line. His relationship with Leia made perfect sense. Their relationship blossomed due to a traumatic event, and their son turned to the dark side. Of course they didn't stay together. Hans death needed to happen to give the series higher stakes. However, I felt it was telegraphed too much. As soon as he shouted Ben! you can hear his fate being sealed.
  The new cast. Poe is a fun character, but Ill hold my judgment until we see more. Finn is my favorite new character. He has a lot of the best lines and I could relate the most to him. I was worried when I saw him with a lightsaber on the poster, thinking How could he go from a stormtrooper to a Jedi in one movie? Luckily, he didnt. He stood up to Kylo Ren and was beaten almost immediately. Rey is the key to the new trilogy, and if she doesnt work, the movies won't work. Im holding final judgment until I see her full arc, but I do have an issue with her character. (See my sexual politics con, below.) BB-8 is great; hes cute and funny without being childish.
  The reveals. This movie inevitably was going to have a lot of reveals for nostalgia service. Most work well. Threepios reveal is a lot of fun, and very funny. Youve seen Han and Chewies reveal in the trailer, and when it happened in the movie, my fellow theater-goers cheered. I was moved, though Id seen it before. My favorite reveal, however, was the Millennium Falcon. Rey calling it junk was a funny callback to Lukes reaction to it in A New Hope.

Star Wars: Cons

Though I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it has problems. Some are minor but some are not. Ill start with the largest flaws and then scale down to the minutiae.

  The story. The story is a re-hash of the original Star Wars, more or less. Its too safe of a formula. Where the original Star Wars wasn't original either, at least it took its themes and motifs from a variety of other sources, like Flash Gordon, various American westerns, and samurai stories. The Force Awakens takes all its cues from Star Wars so it becomes too self-referencing and it doesnt seem as fresh. The Star Wars universe is huge; retreading the same story makes it smaller, not larger. Another Death Star? Call it something else, its still a Death Star. This idea was already old hat in Return of the Jedi. I would have liked to see something new.
  The villains. The villains performances are fine, but they're not given enough to do. The First Order is not fleshed out enough. You understood the Empire vs. the Rebels in the first thirty seconds of Episode IV. The First Order vs. The Resistance was still unclear at the end of the movie. For a movie series with black and white morality, you need a black hats versus white hats story. Gwendolyn Christies character wasn't used much; hopefully we see more of her in the next movie. I did greatly enjoy Kylo Ren, however. His struggle between light and dark was what Anakins character SHOULD have been in the prequels. If the series is going to redeem him, however, killing your own father is a hell of a sin to overcome. Weve already seen a redemption story in Anakin; hopefully Rens goes a bit darker and ends in tragedy.
  The sexual politics. Im excited to see a badass female Jedi, but the problem is Rey didn't earn it. In order to atone for past sexism, Hollywood and feminism are over-compensating with their female characters now. A character is typically only a strong woman if shes a badass, but you cant show her working for it. Its bizarre, and its a bad message for little girls. Rey didn't earn her Force powers, shes just awesome because shes a woman. Han Solo flew the Millennium Falcon for decades, yet Rey, after one flight figured out how to fix it better than he did? Kylo Ren was trained (albeit incompletely) by Luke Skywalker yet Rey beats him in a lightsaber fight? Perhaps it will be explained better in the next movie, but as of now it seems cheap and pandering.
  R2D2s role. This is another issue that may be fixed in the next movie. I found it way too convenient for Artoo to spring back to life when he did. Why didn't he just give up the map earlier so Luke could help with the battle? Perhaps Luke putting his hand on Artoo in the flashback was meant to deactivate him until the right time. As of now, however, it just seems too easy.
  The music. John Williams score is fine, but compared to the original series, and even the prequel series, this score seemed a bit phoned in. The OTs score is legendary and instantly recognizable. The best part of the prequels was the score, especially the incredible Duel of the Fates. Im having trouble even remembering any of the music from The Force Awakens. Its not bad, its just forgettable.

Final verdict: The Force Awakens is a fun, entertaining movie. Fans of the original trilogy will probably like it. I did. Although its well directed and beautiful to look at, the re-hashed story and character flaws prevent it from becoming an A movie. Its a solid B-movie with an A-movies budget. I cant wait for Episode VIII, and Im hoping it fixes some of VIIs problems.

7545895,4,B018FK66TU,"Star Wars The Force Awakens(2015) is one of the best Star Wars films I have ever seen! I told you J.J. would do it! The magic in Star Wars started to fade away with the Star Wars prequels(1999, 2002, 2005) and the Clone Wars cartoon(2008). The Force Awakens goes back to the spirit of Episode IV and Episode V. The film was also very expensive. It had a budget of $300 million dollars. The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi(1983). The Galactic Empire has been replaced by something worse...The First Order. Luke Skywalker has gone into hiding.
Adam Driver(from the HBO TV show Girls) was cast as Kylo Ren, the literal and metaphorical grandson of Darth Vader. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo. Chewbacca and The Millenium Falcon also return. The story also introduces us to new characters such as Rey(Daisy Ridley), Finn(John Boyega) and Poe Dameron(Oscar Isaac). Carrie Fisher returns as Leia. John Williams also returns with a solid, well crafted music score. The film has some cool dogfights in outer space and a light saber fight between Rey and Kylo Ren. The film also does a good job mixing practical sets and puppets with CGI. The film also brings back Joseph Campbell themes about heroism back to Star Wars. Rogue One A Star Wars Story was released a year later. The Last Jedi has already been released. There's a young Han Solo movie in the works.

I was excited about this based on the trailer in the fact that JJ Abrams made it since he did a pretty good job with the Star Trek reboot. Anyway I was pretty disappointed. So many things that were just not that great. You know Han Solo is going to die because there's been so many articles about Harrison Ford wishing he had died so it was totally predictable. The primary villain has temper tantrums twice even though he is disciplined enough to stop a laser beam mid air and hold it still. His master looks like Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants. And the girl just has all the Jedi Powers all at once at the end of the movie. Go training with Yoda, oh Jedi schools, no instruction from Obi-Wan Kenobi. She's seems just short of being a Master with no instruction. I'm surprised everyone loved it so much or maybe it's just the new generation that likes it?

  There are only three details I would have changed about this film. Namely;

1. Han Solo's death. (Had me crying.)

2. The plot is a little TO much like A New Hope. (Kind of knew how it would start and end when I first watched it.)

3. No matter how they change the name, IT IS STILL A DEATH STAR! (We have had three huge ""blow up everything"" weapons in the star wars movies. If they make one more I am going to scream!

This movie wouldn't be the same without Rey. The light saber fight was epic. Finely they let a girl lead the fight. (Nothing wrong with the original star wars movies, but they are a bit male heavy. Nice to see a change!)

Good helpings of humor to. BB-8 is adorable. Finn is worthy, and very funny.

I have to say The new bad guy, Ki lo Ren, does not have very much dimension, and is pretty much Leader Snoke's puppet, nothing else. His temper surprised me, and he killed his Dad without a second thought. This kid is really demented! He is defiently no Vader.

Really awesome movie none the less. Rey is my idol now :)",1513468800,,1194,4.134199134199134

Rey would have made a GREAT Jaina Solo.

the story in this one is just a huge ripoff of A New Hope and the actual story is a bit lame. Fin's character is amazingly annoying almost to the level of Jar Jar annoying, you are secretly hopping he is dead at the end of the movie (unfortunately we all know he is alive) his character adds absolutely nothing to the story really.  i really think JJ had no clue what he was doing other than he wanted to add his special one of a kind (like yoda) characters to this franchise so he could feel special... he blew it big time!  Kilo is another annoying character  this time i blame it on the actor, not a good fit, and story wise he should be Jacen not Ben.... why the hell would Han and Lea name their kid Ben? a person Han only knew for maybe a day and lea never even met, makes no since. Ben should be Luke's son not Han's JJ is an idiot .

if you know absolutely nothing about star wars and you have only kinda seen the other 6 or 7 (if you have seen Rouge One) movies you may enjoy this one.  it could make for an entertaining science fiction movie just not a good Star Wars movie.",1511827200,2,1623,4.088050314465409

7545990,1,B018FK66TU,"Inexplicable reboot of A New Hope with lame, nay laughable acting and clumsy politically correct casting and characters. Zero chemistry between Finn and Rey and I cringed during the hug scene where it was suggested that there might be some romance there. SORRY FINNSTER, NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Part of a dumbing-down / appeal-to-the-lowest-common-denominator trend to pander to millennials, or worse, tweens. The Darth Vader redux character reminded me of Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club - thinks he's tough but really he's just an emo wuss under that space monk robe and love-child-of-Iron Man-&-an-anteater face mask. James Earl Jones' voice alone could kick this guy's @ss. The return of the 3 main characters from Episode 4 was completely impotent; seeing them reminded me of my grandparents watching a particularly tedious Lawrence Welk episode - just old, tired, over-medicated, using slow-motion-like-they're-underwater movements (Harrison Ford's old man trot was hard to watch [and as POTUS would say - SAD!]) and mildly, chronically irritated. I watched this garbage free on a plane and still felt ripped off. Actually made me pine for episodes 1, 2 and 3: as miserable as those movies were (mostly 1 and 2), at least they aspired to be original. I'm at the point where I actually believe that many of the five-word-or-less 5 star reviews (""great movie,"" ""loved it,"" ""hey, it's Star Wars,"" ""delivered on time (???)"") are either plants or are generated by some computer program to ensure sales outpace the movie's budget. It's a shame but this franchise (as well as Alien) has been effectively neutered (probably why it appeals to all the limp fanboys).

7545992,5,B018FK66TU,"Star wars was a film series that defined my youth. I have owned all of them at some point or another in a variety of formats and have all but memorized them from watching them over and over.
  I also have been on love with 3d since my youth. I bought a 3d tv and blu ray years ago, but the Star Wars series was not done in 3d...until The Force Awakens. No matter how many times I'd seen the movie, adding the full, Rich 3d made it come alive. The sound is rich and vibrant with the epic John Williams sound track.
  The behind the scenes features are informative and entertaining for those who love to know how it's done and what all goes into the production of the film.
Even the case is a work of art. From its attractive, 3d artwork on the cover to the beautifully collectors item inserts, this set seems like it should be far more expensive than it actually is.
Whether you loved the film or are a critic, the power of the production on this product is admirable.  Well done, folks. Well done.",1507593600,2,997,4.198952879581152

7545994,1,B018FK66TU,"This has got to be the laziest bit of film-making and money-grab in box office history. This movie, down to even the tiniest details, is the same movie as the original Star Wars film (Episode 4). Let me sum up the plot... *SPOILER ALERT* (unless you've seen Ep 4 already, since they are the same movie). A loner orphan lives on a desert planet, barely making ends meet. There's a galactic struggle happening between an evil empire and a band of rebels. The evil empire builds a gigantic weapon that can kill a planet. The rebels steal those plans and hide them on a small, cute droid who doesn't talk, but makes lots of funny noises. The droid ends up on the desert planet where the orphan finds it. The orphan then escapes the desert planet and goes on a journey of self discovery to find out that, in actuality, our loner is really a jedi warrior. The loner-turned-jedi joins up with the rebels to use the stolen plans to locate a weak point in the evil empire's weapon. In order to destroy it they must fly a spacecraft into it, dropping a bomb at a specific point to cause a core explosion. Does any of this sound familiar? Save your time and money and re-watch Episode 4. At least then you won't have to put up with the unique ""features"" of this movie, like the Darth Vader replacement character who is somehow twice as powerful as Darth Vader but acts like a 12 year old girl who forgot to take her adderall.",1507593600,5,1414,4.380228136882129

Nostalgic exuberance best describes the latest chapter in the Star Wars saga. From the beginning director JJ Abrams throws the audience back to their childhood. When Star Wars presented hope and wonder that influenced numerous generations.

The opening scene harks to the original film  creating an eerie foreboding. SW fans sense the dark side still has a strong presence in the galaxy. Even though the Emperor and Vader have perished, the First Order has risen to take hold of the power vacuum.  The legendary actor, Max von Sydow, reminds us the Force is out of balance and warns Resistance pilot, Poe Dameron.  A new character introduced by Abrams while interspersing old favorites.  There is no heavy handiness to his method of reintroducing favorite characters  organic and inorganic.  Viewers will appreciate the comedic comradery of stormtrooper Fin (John Boyega) and the fiercely independent Rae(Daisy Ridley). Both have somber pasts that offer only vague insights to the last 30 years. It tantalizes the audience and reminds fans what has happened to Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca?

With all the action and nostalgia, Episode 7s story focuses clearly on this fans primary question, the influential role of the Force throughout the galaxy. The Force Awakens begins seeding this question in the minds of the audience. Essentially, how can a dying faith as stated in Episode 4 (the original Star Wars) come back from the brink of extinction? What role does it play 30 years after Episode 6, Return of the Jedi.

Masterfully, Abrams shows us the wonder and terror of the Force throughout Episode 7. Like First Order warrior and leader, Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver), the audience is unsure of the present situation. Although Kylo Ren is a menacing master of the dark force, his lightsaber unsheathed shows the shakiness of his path. Looking closely the audience can see the serrated edges of his lightsaber. Nothing like the clean perfect lines of his predecessors and their light sabers. Episode 7 is introducing fans to a whole new aspect of the Force.

With the latest CGI technology balanced with amazing real life-size sets, the technical crew of this film is truly the shining stars. In some ways they steal many scenes.  The Force Awakens sends the audience to spectacular terrains and harsh landscapes without the need of supercomputers crunching vast data. The landscapes, like John Williams virtuoso score, set the emotional pitch throughout the film.

The Force is everywhere; it surrounds us and binds us. Episode 7 shows us again how it can be a sense of hope and wonder.

Not certain about the PC agenda behind it, and confused about a few things, like storm troopers not looking  or sounding like Jengo Fett?  But still a good movie and great to see the original cast.",1503964800,,431,4.144578313253012

7546069,1,B018FK66TU,"I saw this in the theaters long ago, but had to cast my vote for this being one of the worst movies made. This is nothing more than recycled old plots (if you've seen the previous Star Wars movies, you've already seen this one too)  turned into crap by the politically correct crowd in Hollywood...

The only thing new here is that since we're constantly told that men are bad and the source of all problems in the world, we need to have a new female lead that makes all the men look like useless lumps of coal. She can do anything, including easily surpassing Luke's efforts to control the force and wield a light sabre; not only can she defeat accomplished swordsmen (or light sabre men), but she can repair the Millennium Falcon within minutes of entering it for the first time. Of course she's never been ""off planet"" before, but she's a strong woman so she must be an expert at knowing how to repair and fly old ships, right?

Of course, this is just crap from the social justice warriors of today, but the real point is that the movie just plain sucks. I have completely lost any interest in seeing any more star wars movies. Rogue One is only OK, but it's down right fabulous next to this pile o'garbage...Deserves -5 stars.. Skip it.",1502668800,5,1241,4.434210526315789

The prequels (Ep 1-3) were not as good as the originals (Ep 4-6), but this Episode 7 is trash compared to 4-6 and not as good as 1-3. It is completely bland and formulaic. They just made a boring checklist of things to include from Eps 4-6 and checked them off by including them in this movie. There is no regard for the storytelling, wonder, and surprises that made the originals so great.

7546124,2,B018FK66TU,"I could say so much about this movie, but I'll settle for this. This movie was not made by a visionary, and thus, it lacks a lot of the originality, depth, and epicness of the original AND prequel trilogies. Say what you want about George Lucas, and I've said my share on the prequels but watching this movie a few times I've realized how much more I can respect and appreciate the originality, depth, and epicness of the prequels. This movie also helped me to see more clearly the type of director and person J.J. Abrams is, even when it comes to other movies like the Star Trek reboots (as I'm a fan in the original Star Trek series) and outliers like Super 8: during the movie, you're on the edge of your seat, watching every detail to see and try to understand what is happening, but near the middle and end of the movies, everything just blows up into mindless (yet unspectacular, unambitious, and unimpressive) action sequences and you only realize at the end that nothing was REALLY answered or PAYED OFF; in the end, it feels like the entire movie(s) wasn't(weren't) worth it - the entire movie was just a tease. Now, sure, something 'happens' in TFA, and it brings 'new'... what? Ships? - not quite, they're just repainted - Plots? - not really, it's a rehash of A New Hope - Aliens? - come on now, that's not too hard anyhow - Characters? Maybe if you only count FINN, but in the entire movie, everybody else either literally being a character from the original series or another form of one (Rey is Luke, Kylo is Anakin); Finn throughout the movie comes across as more of a fanboy, anyhow, and although his character moves things along, it almost seems that a contemporary Earthling got teleported into the body of a random stormtrooper at the beginning of the movie - it doesn't quite fit. But of course, JJ is all about 'mystery' and 'keeping the audience guessing', and his favorite thing about Star Wars was that it originally had no expanded universe, no exposition, no greater meaning, just a bunch of characters thrown in together for us to watch - and it shows... Go figure, his favorite Star Wars movie was A New Hope, although most hardcore fans of Star Wars, certaintly of the original series, would put A New Hope after episodes V and VI, just as most fans of the prequels would put A Phantom Menace at the end of their line, thus making most people who are fans of both the prequels and the original series (such as myself) put A New Hope at nearly last place! Given that lineup, I now have a new line-up, and have placed The Force Awakens in 7th place, or even 8th, given how much more I enjoyed the originality, depth, lore, and epicness of Rogue One. Really looking forward to The Last Jedi, and wish Rion Johnson the best hope trying to clean up the messes that JJ left behind for him to clean up; it's encouraging that he seems to be going in a more original direction and focusing on the depthful meanings in Star Wars, rather than just the character drama and meticulous slap-stick action that JJ obsesses over.",1498608000,5,3042,4.51268115942029

7546141,5,B018FK66TU,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" has been reviewed more than 10,000 times already so I'll simply say that it truly does uphold the franchise with a great storyline, believable special effects, interesting characters, and excellent performances by the cast.
Director J.J. Abrams harkened back to the first two ""Star Wars"" films in making ""The Force Awakens"" by staying away from implausible plot devices as well as strange - and poorly thought out - characters ala Jar Jar Binks. The genius of the first two ""Star Wars"" films was the fact they told terrific stories that audiences could relate to on a personal level. The four films that followed... not so much. They relied more on special effects than on good writing and it showed. Abrams did not fall into that trap and that also shows.

Another part that bothered me was Leia after getting the news of she too got over it really fast (at least she almost shed a tear).

7546153,3,B018FK66TU,"Clearly I'm in the minority when it comes to thinking that this film is mediocre.  It's not bad.....but it's not great either.  It doesn't surprise me that Disney is starting to product tons of new films with the Star Wars IP but I just get tired of seeing the same things over and over again and start to feel like I'm getting tricked.  I've already paid to see them blow up a space station what else ya got?  How about a BIGGER space station?

I have no background in acting but I thought Daisy Ridley's performance was mediocre at best.  Her eyes are huge at literally everything that anyone ever says to her.  Her reactions seem rather stiff and mechanical; lacking emotion.  Same complaint about Bryan Cranston they both have like 1 emotional level.  Grimace.  I've read several extended universe books such as The Glove of Darth Vader and probably 10-15 of the Jedi Apprentice books (Obi Wan as an apprentice) when I was younger and found all of those infinitely more interesting. I found this film to be mostly a rehash of ideas and I think as we move on its primary purpose serves to pass the torch.  I would be surprised if Luke is not destroyed in the next film since that's basically what's occurring.

I found a lot of the dialog difficult to really believe.  Han Solo walking up to his kid basically asking to die.  I just found it hard to believe he would be that dumb I guess since his background is entirely survival based.  Film also flaunted how diverse it was and I was like OK I get it jeez.

It's worth seeing for sure; probably just see if your friends have a copy and see it for free.  Not trying to start a flame war but I think if you're a hardcore fan you might like it but to the average Joe it's OK I guess.",1496966400,,1735,4.321981424148607

This movie is fun, borrows heavily from the original films (IV - VI), and was worth seeing in-theater. VIII exceeds the prequel trilogy in every measurably positive aspect.  Somebody missed an opportunity to kill Jar-Jar, but with any luck we'll get that outcome someday (if The Disney could find a reason to have Jar-Jar die in an epic blaze of glory, I am certain the fan-base will be WILDLY AMUSED AND SATISFIED).",1494288000,,498,4.584269662921348
7546214,3,B018FK66TU,"Basically, this film felt like a lot of tying up loose ends and a pale re-retlling of the 1976 original. Yeah we get to see Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford again. Yes, Chewbacca's back-a. Along with C3PO and a somnolent R2D2. We get to meet a new ""Darth"" this one named Kylo Ren (I guess Darth Emo was already taken), the whiniest, most petulant super villain in history (And where did he get that nose? Certainly not from Carrie Fisher or Harrison Ford. But I digress). But the real failure of the film is in imagination. Seriously, this time the Death Star is a whole planet that eats entire suns for power (But can still be blown up by a plucky band of misfits, yadda, yadda, yadda). Hooray for the strong female lead and the first black leading character in Star Wars (Lando was never more than a third banana). Hooray for the suggestion that Finn and Poe might be more than just friends. BB-8 was cute (he looks like a bb, or an eight ball, get it?) And the presence of Edna Mode... sorry, I mean Maz Kanatta, was inspired. Overall, the movie was entertaining, but just didn't really rise to the challenge of being the flagship for a new generation. Maybe the next one will imagine a new plot. Maybe. It seems unlikely.",1494201600,2,1224,4.444444444444445

7546217,1,B018FK66TU,"I can see how many would like it although I'm surprised many do (just because it's SW doesn't automatically mean we should like it). Don't get me wrong, I love SW: I read the books, have all six films, role play in it, know the dialogue from the OT, have lightsabers, my brother and I played endlessly with our toys...you get the picture.  I was excited for another movie to come out even if they nixed the EU.  So after 2003, you except an original storyline...we didn't get that.  We got a reboot of ANH.

The movie starts out well enough, I'll grant it that.  The visual effects were good, the scenery was nice, and the music was spot on.  But that's where it ends.  Kylo Ren is an annoying character and doesn't at all act like a Sith, he's whiny and annoying.  The stormtroopers still can't get a good shot off; Snoke looks stupid (for lack of a better word), Rey annoyed me after she learns of the Force.  She believes she doesn't have it, then all of the sudden finds out she does and can master it!  Are you kidding me?  Luke, who's the greatest of all Jedi, even went through training!  And she beats Ren, who supposedly wiped out the Jedi Order?  Can we push the laughing button?  Oh yes, let's not forget that even Finn, who isn't trained in the Force, is able to injure Ren.  Really?  Finn should've been dead; don't get me wrong I like his character, but going up against a fully trained Sith and you survive?  Also Luke...in exile.  Who cares about your sister, friends, the Rebellion, etc....I failed and am moving off to be alone.  This isn't the Clone Wars and if it was because of Ren, even more of a horrible plot line.  The Luke in this film is a coward (and it pains me to say that because Luke is my all time favorite character).

A Han rant: You can tell Harrison did it for the money.  His acting is there (because let's admit he is a good actor), but that's where it stops. He looks tired and there are many lines he uses, but one that stood out to me was, ""Can I use this? Wow this is good."" Or however he says it (meaning Chewie's bowcaster). Are you telling me the years he's known Chewie, he's never seen what it could do or has never handled it?  This is Han Solo, not some rookie smuggler.

Oh yes, let's do Ben Solo.  Really writers?....more like copying from the EU here (also with Ren's mask, looks like Revan's).  Leia barely knew Obi-Wan and probably only heard a lot from her father.  It was a dumb choice; they could've gone with any cool/unique name, but chose Ben.  In fact the writing is poor after the first hour.

There are probably other things, but that's all I remember for right now.  I'm curious to see what the 2nd one will reveal, but hearing that it's another rewrite of ESB and RotJ; I'm not expecting much.  To me and others, yes Disney and Abrams ruined Star Wars.",1493942400,7,2818,4.310476190476191

The opening action sequence sucked me into the story with a feeling of adventure that only slackened a little during the first hour. Poe Dameron and Finn carried an exciting plot and the return of Harrison Ford to Star Wars was well-handled. But the second half was much weaker. Kylo Ren was much less menacing without the mask and something about Starkiller Base didn't work for me at all. The duel between Ren and Rey in the snow was pretty good, though, and the shot of Rey looking up from Finns body at the Millenium Falcon hovering with the light behind it waswell, it was the magic and wonder of Star Wars in one moment.

I cannot believe something that has plagiarized such a classic piece of film history has gotten such praise.  Every single element of A New Hope has been simply copy and pasted into this film.  Not a single original idea is present in this film.

I also enjoyed the novelization of Rogue One, which I haven't seen so far, but I think people were so starved for the return to the good old days that watching the '70s and '80s cast onscreen represented, that they were willing to overlook the fact that this was end-to-end a bad movie. I could take an hour to tell why I found it so rotten, from Kylo Ren's sissy lightsaber fighting style (poke-poke) to...well, how about I just say it required one to overlook so much nonsense that in the end it was an insult to intelligence.

Wow!
What happened? After all the hype, all the wrangling at Disney, all the hoopla...
THIS IS IT? Wow...
You've seen this movie already too, it was originally called ""Star Wars"", it came out a long time ago..

It had a Death Star too, a big X-Wing/Tie Fighter battle and a big exploding space battle weapon at the end too, but it was not RIDICULOUS.
A Space Janitor? Really? And one that does double duty as a member of the main villain's Murder/Death?kill squad. Of course the Space Janitor is black too, and a clown, and bad at his job. Wow...

And the villain? A pretty boy teenager with anger management problems.
The hero, a little3 girl who turns into a Super Jedi at the last minute who defeats Teenage Wasteland five minutes after picking up a light saber??
Yes, that actually was in the film..

Han Solo is in the film too, then gets killed in the stupidest way possible. Hey, I don't blame Harrison Ford. I'd find any way to bail out of this mess..

Poor Carrie Fischer, she pulled a Raul Julia (Street Fighter) by participating in this debacle.

Worse, the ""Super Weapon"" the bad guys use in this film defies common sense and logic in every way. Powered by sucking up an entire sun?? Really? Did the writer bother to talk to anyone with at least an 8th grader's understanding of science? How it was destroyed was even more ridiculous.

Oh, and Mark Hamil is in this film, sort of. No speaking part, just alot of staring at the end of the film. Gahhhh!!
I paid good money at the theater to see this muddled, insipid mess, don't buy the DVD.

There are so many dumb, ridiculous, insane things in this movie, its hard to list all of them, here are some:
- I want my next car to be made out of the same stuff as the Millennium Falcon, I mean, the way that old ship, started up after years of inactivity (by someone who never flew anything ever), got bounced around and crashed and could still fly was incredible, incredibly ridiculous..
- The Angry Teenager could stop laser beams in flight while simultaneously grabbing a rebel while barking orders to his murder/death/kill housekeeping janitorial squad and THEN doesn't release the beam until he is flying away in his ship BUT he couldn't defeat a teenage girl who just learned how to pick up a light saber. D'oh!!
- General Han Solo going back to being a two-bit smuggler for criminals or  Han Solo dying by being stupid. Which is dumber? Hard to decide.
- The flying sofa in which  Princess(?) Leia was flying around. What a lazy design.
- The Super Duper Duper Duper Duper Star Destroyer. What? How? Huh? Nobody noticed stars disappearing? Fires MIRVS across the galaxy with 100% accuracy? Eats suns like tic-tacs? Ha-ha-ha, so ridiculous, even for a fantasy/Sci-fi movie..
- The main Republic capital planet totally, completely unprotected? Even that little Hoth base had shields.. Dumb, dumb, dumb,dumb, dumb....
- X-Wings flying through a CLOUD of TIE fighters in the ""final big battle"", and most of them survived? Just how bad are these Imperial pilots? Also, no capital ship support? I guess those Calimari ships were rentals...
- BAD ACTING BY THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS, YUCK..

7546331,5,B018FK66TU,"The ""five stars"" is for the movie. I bought the ""Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital HD"" package from a retail store and chose to receive my HD video through Amazon. If I could rate the process for redeeming the digital HD, I'd give it one star.

If you redeem your video through Amazon, the video does not show up in your digital library. Instead, you get an account credit for the price of the digital HD version on Amazon (just under $20). To redeem your video, go to this product page and ""purchase"" the video. The button you click will say ""buy"" and will have the price on it, but you won't be charged. Your account credit will be used to purchase the movie.

This isn't intuitive. I spent over half an hour trying to figure out why my video wasn't showing up in my digital library, which is logically where it should be.  What makes this worse is that first you go to a Disney website to redeem the code that's inside the DVD case. When you do that and select Amazon to receive your video, you get an Amazon-specific code. The Disney website also includes an option to ""link"" a Disney account to your Amazon account. In trying to figure out why my video wasn't showing up in my Amazon digital library, I thought I might have to create a Disney account and link it to Amazon. So I created a Disney account and it indeed showed my code as redeemed, but it still wasn't in my Amazon library. I linked my Disney account to my Amazon account, thinking that would help, but it still wasn't there.

I figured out that the Amazon code basically gives you an account credit by finding some screen in Amazon's navigation (it's so far tucked away I can't even find it again) that shows you the balance equal to the price of the digital HD version. This balance is specific for digital video purchases. I'm not even sure if you have to purchase this movie to use the credit - I might have been able to use the credit to purchase the digital HD version of Rogue One - I don't know. But that's how it works. If anybody who has control over this process is reading, it's confusing because:

1) You first go through a Disney website and it's not clear if you should link your account to Amazon or not
2) Your movie doesn't show up in your digital library
3) The screen showing your account credit for digital videos is hard to find
4) To redeem your video, you click a button that says ""buy"" and has a price on it.",1490400000,164,2392,4.283185840707965

I have no problem with Disney or any company making money within reason, but silly controlled set releases make it ridiculous.

Other than a somewhat decent storyline, good special effects, and nostalgia the prequel trilogies (episodes I, II, and III) were barely worth my time.  Due to the prequel trilogy's awfulness, I did not have high hopes for this movie.  That was fortunate, as I could sit in the theater like a little kid again with my jaw in my lap.  This was a fantastic continuation of the story first brought to us in 1976.  All of the sad portions, the happy portions, the funny portions, and all of the goose bump inspiringly awesome portions add up to a great film.  I would imagine this is even great if you are not a Star Wars fan from before; probably on purpose as this is the way to introduce the story of Star Wars to a new generation.

3D is used so effectively in The Force Awakens that I was actually disappointed  it when I watched the standard Blu-ray that was released first, and I won't watch it now unless it's in 3D because it's so impactful.

7546439,3,B018FK66TU,"The Internet Movie Database (iMDb) reviews of this movie are overwhelmingly negative, whereas Amazon's viewers are much more positive.  Now, whether this is because Amazon is selling products while the iMDb website is primarily a research tool and avenue for movie buffs to express their opinions, or because of some other reason, seems a good topic for discussion.  Many of the iMDb fans, in fact, gave this movie scathing, lacerating reviews, most of them giving it only one or two stars on a 10-star rating system.  There were many, many more reviews than I had time to read, but I saw very few that were positive, so I'm a little bit mystified that the iMDb overall rating is 8.1

I am one Star Wars fan who didn't much like the three prequels that came out after the original series, but they had their moments, and were entertaining enough, when I allowed myself to put my brain on hold. This film, which picks up several years after the third of the first three adventures, Episode VI (judging from the very real, visible aging of the stars who play Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker), also has a few good points.  But those emotional moments of lovely, character-driven drama, and a little bit of humor, are not enough to compensate for the lack of imagination where the plot is concerned.  As many critics have pointed out, this movie feels like a rehash of the first three Star Wars movies, only not as fresh as those were in the years they were released.  I would have liked some other kind of adventure, I guess, while keeping to the basic mythology created in the beginning.  Just as the Borg in the Star Trek franchise became tiresome after a while, the Death Star and the First Order have become truly boring. The obvious scenes meant to conjure up the Third Reich in the audience's minds are both conceptually and visually such an unoriginal idea -- it's been done to death and no longer has much power.  It has become a clich&eacute;.  Evil can take many forms, so why couldn't the writers and director of this movie come up with a different idea, and more importantly, a better script?  It's sad to see creative talents run out of ideas.  This project should have been shelved until something more original and exciting could have been written.

Even more egregious is the violation of what had been a pretty well thought out spiritual mythology:  the characters of Rey and Finn seem to master their use of light sabers with no prior training.  What's up with that?  Wasn't the path to becoming a Jedi Knight, a long, difficult climb, requiring years of training and very special talent?  Okay, so Rey showed signs of having great mental, spiritual power, but there was no development from point A to point B.  She very skillfully pilots a totally unfamiliar ship, among other things, and soon the film is just a comic strip, and not a very good one at that.

I did love seeing Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford reprising their rolls as older, more world weary characters, but again, there was very little explanation as to how they got to where we meet them in this story.  These are (or in the case of Fisher, were) talented actors who deserved better lines to speak. I don't blame them for taking part in this project, nor do I feel sorry for them that the property wasn't better; I just see wasted opportunities here. Nevertheless, it was good to see Carrie Fisher one last time (I understand that she finished filming her scenes in Episode VIII, but I have not seen that picture yet).

The special effects are excellent, of course, but once again, we've seen most of this stuff before:  the aerial dog fights between the bad guys and the good guys, flying through tight spaces in the Death Star or through rock canyons, the frequent fire fights in the desert, the woods, the tundra, and cavernous depths within huge ships being sabotaged and blown up.  It's old, old hat.  I did like the humorously scary monsters in Han Solo's cargo ship, and got the sequence's parody of Alien advancing through the ship's hatches, only in fast motion.  However, there were few scenes in this picture that were as much fun.  The ""watering hole"" scene with all the freaky aliens and musicians was a pretty much reprise of the bar scene in the first Star Wars movie.

If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, this would get 2 1/2 from me, but I didn't hate the movie enough to give it only two. I hope this movie, which is pretty much a synopsis of all the plots and concepts put forth in the original three, will be followed by a better sequel.  The things I've heard about Episode VIII don't give me much hope, though.  To the creators:  May the Force be with You -- apparently, you need it!!!",1487116800,10,4704,4.592105263157895

7546476,4,B018FK66TU,"Part of me was excited and part of me was terrified when I heard this was happening.

Over the years I have seen my fandom for this legendary franchise decline. At this point in my life I am still a fan but, compared to so many films that I have seen, Star Wars is still just as enjoyable but, not elite. The first installment of this brand new sequel trilogy takes us 30 years after Episode VI. We get a new threat, the return of some legendary characters and a whole new bunch of heroes and heroines. The film is fun with everything that made the very first film great. However, it is similarities that this new film has to the very first film that make the film good but not great. The highlights of this film for me of course are BB-8, the return of Han Solo and the great blend of CGI and practical effects. What doesn't work for me is the heroes journey which have seen in Star Wars already.

I am not saying that this is a bad movie in the slightest. I personally wanted to see theses next three films work off of the Timothy Zahn books which I think would have made very original and thought provoking films. However, it is still great to have an excuse to go back to the theaters and see a Star Wars movie and I am looking forward to the next installment.",1486598400,6,1264,4.176229508196721

7546478,1,B018FK66TU,"So we all do shameful things when we are drunk.  Last night, after most of a bottle of wine I bought or rented The Force Awakens.  I mean, its NEVER going on Prime cause Disney owns it and so, while completely inebriated, my curiosity got the best of me.

I was not disappointed, only because I already expected to be completely disappointed by anything that hack JJ Abrams puts his hands on.  I'm not sure if I can blame him for the 6 year old level screen writing, but I can definitely blame him for the 8 year old level weapons like the stupid light saber.  It seems he thinks CGI can cover his incompetence, and after wasting 2 hours of my life previously on lens flair (that one was at least on prime) and now this, I can tell you it cannot.

Anyway, I have now, for the first time in a long time, personally funded that no talent hack, and I feel dirty.  If you haven't already seen it, do youself a favor and wait for a friend to play it at their house during a party.  You can slip off to the kitchen and have some drinks and make fun of it with the other people who think it's lame, and go back occasionally to again have your hopes dashed that there will be a classic story line before returning to the kitchen to recover.",1486512000,9,1232,4.147058823529412

Han fails at life (divorced/separated and back to his old ways - how pathetic). He hardly flies the Falcon in this movie (that new girl gets all the fun scenes).  Ridiculous new death star (a planet death star? Really? Disney is really reaching with that one).  And why does that new emperor-guy need to be so big in the hologram?

I've not watched the other 3, although I know that one is the Blue Ray, one is the plain DVD, and the last is Bonus material.
The 3D disc is spectacular. I thought it would be. Like the other 3D discs in my collection, it is well done as a 3D version of the one that was in theaters. I have it on a 60 inch screen, which is plenty big enough to get the flavor of the movie.
I realize that 3D TVs have been panned, primarily due to the watcher having to wear the glasses, but I don't find that a reason to knock the technology. I'm using a Samsung unit and it is wonderful on which to watch 3D discs. Naturally, I use a Blue Ray player as well.

7546538,3,B018FK66TU,"THIS IS A REVIEW ONLY OF THE 3D BLU RAY FOR 3D LOVERS.  This move is pretty sparse on 3D effects.  Since it is of the same genre, I am going to compare it to Guardians of the Galaxy which had amazing 3D (5/5).  This movie really utilizes 3D very little.  I do not recall any pop-outs.  Some of the outer space scenes with the ships are given a sense of depth with 3D, but for instance, the scene with the Millennium Falcon toward the beginning with Rey and Finn trying to escape the First Order on Jakku, that would have been the place to really showcase 3D and it is quite underwhelming.  If you already own the blu ray (like me), this is not really worth the money in my opinion.",1485734400,7,681,4.121212121212121

7546554,4,B018FK66TU,Long awaited continuation of the Star Wars saga. Well done with incredible 3D effects. My only problem is the practice of making people buy the dvd and the blu-ray versions of the movie to get the 3D. All I wanted was the 3D version but the widespread practice of many studios to only sell it as a bundle is expensive and nonsensical. Like buying 3D blu-rays isn't expensive enough.

7546609,1,B018FK66TU,"My fiance and I had expected so much from this film  because of the hype and because its from J. J. Abrams, the man who brought back Star Trek in stellar fashion.  But this film is a joke, a pathetic joke.  The plot is lackluster, far too similar to the first Star Wars film (later, rather pretentiously subtitled A New Hope) with a little Dark-Side Anakin thrown in.  Kylo Ren is the lamest, weakest Sith-Lord-wannabe ever.  Anakin while whiny (& Christensen is a bad actor) was at least an interesting character  you could appreciate his inner struggle.  But with Kylo  theres nothing there, no menace and no acting, no nothing.  So next to The Phantom Menace, which at least had the legendary Darth Maul (though even he wasn't enough to counter the stupidity of Jar Jar & that absurdly long podrace), this is the worst Star Wars film.

Do not waste your money buying or even renting, just watch it when it comes on TV  or borrow it from one of your Millennial friends.  Save your cash for the next one  maybe it will be better.",1484784000,7,1030,4.473118279569892

7546658,3,B018FK66TU,"I just watched Force Awakens a second time today after thoroughly enjoying Claudia Gray's works in the new canon. It was definitely better than the first viewing, and I wouldn't say I hate it. But it still feels like such an incomplete film. Exploring some of the surrounding non-film material definitely helps, but the film should be able to stand on its own. I feel that Disney is kind of cheating us with the way they are handling the new canon in that since it tells crucial aspects of the story they can just rely on books and comics to fill in the blanks. I think that becomes an excuse for lazy film-making. In no other Star Wars movie was I full of such questions. Star Wars was never about the ""mystery."" The OT was about the adventure, and the PT was about the worldbuilding. I feel like this movie is trying to be ""nostalgically-mysterious"" and I'm simply not impressed. It should have provided a clear and concise rundown of who is the Resistance if there is also a Republic, how did the First Order come about and how did they manage to build a weapon that is at least 5 times the size of the already huge Death Star without the Republic knowing and intervening, especially since the Empire was crucially defeated, etc. But we get none of this. Instead, what we get is ANH nostalgia.

And that's fine. It's an okay movie on its own. But as a Star Wars movie it's extremely vague. It also self-worships too much, with Rey being a Mary Sue character and the beloved Han Solo (spoiler) being killed simply to further Ren's character development, who evidently has died. (But since this is Star Wars, of course he didn't! He miraculously escaped and will come back stronger than ever but now with scars.) I wish that this film strove to fit into the existing Star Wars universe instead of trying to remake it. I mean, we've seen so much of this before. The PT was amazing in that it didn't just self-worship the OT but added to the existing continuity in attempt to explain it. It even was so generous as to incorporate elements from the EU such as Coruscant. But this movie seems to want to be outside of the continuity and be the object around which a new continuity is constructed. And I just don't appreciate that very much.",1484179200,,2237,4.482843137254902

Absolutely captivating and immersive, especially the pop out images of the imperial destroyers, x-wing, tie fighters and the monster battle scenes on Han Solo's ship.

7546663,4,B018FK66TU,"I am a fan of this film. It was exciting to watch with my son who was the same age I was when I first saw the original in the theater.
I bought it for the 3D version, I think the 2D is best, but we have a 70"" 3D tv so
it's fun and looks better on a good 3D TV than in the theater.

The DVD disc is useless to anyone who owns a 3D DVD player... anyone who buys this so.....

I've seen every one of them, but this ties in old characters while bringing new and more diverse characters to the star wars universe. The storyline is amazing, I absolutely love all of the characters in here with all of my heart. This was actually the first star wars movie I watched, but I had some background knowledge so everything made sense. I'd highly recommend everyone watch this",1484092800,2,455,4.7

7546669,1,B018FK66TU,"I'm sorry but this movie is only a mix up copy of the earlier films.
It's poorly written and lacks so much qualities.
Acting and roles are terrible.
The director is really a poor copycat and mainstreamer that for the sake of all fans and sci-fi people, never should do a serious title ever again.
I will not pay for the rest of the films to come.
I will download them for free. Only becouse this movie was such a low quality directed film.

Kids will probably like the CGI though, but thats what it is. Han and Leia are some of the worst directed and acted i've seen in a grand budget movie.
It's a plagiated and soul less time killer.",1484006400,,635,4.204918032786885

The writing is just appallingly bad. The plot is senseless and the main character is a giant wish fulfillment mechanism that can simply go into ""god mode"" whenever required.

Rather than adhere to the ""show, don't tell"" rule of writing for character chemistry, the writers/editors simply state that two characters have grown closer through fiat. *poof* Now they care about each other because... reasons!

Watch Rogue One and then go back to watch this thing... The difference in the writing and plotting quality is stark.

7546765,5,B018FK66TU,"A great new addition to the Star Wars family. The new characters are good and in the end I would like to know more about them. The old characters, while lovely to see again, makes me feel a little sad for so much time having passed between then and now.
The ships, though familiar are different enough to feel knew and thankfully the Falcon was there again and is a big part of things. I'd have been crushed to not see it again.
The lack of R2 was a bit concerning, he really is the hero of these things, without him most of the others would have failed.
Thankfully they did humor right in this one, the lack of a kiddie only character was left out. The dialog was everything you might expect from a Star Wars movie but over all it isn't terribly distracting.
Though the plot was similar to one you have seen before, or at least feels that way from the first viewing. If you look a little closer at it there are enough changes to be the fresh start that we need for more of these films. I look forward to seeing many more in the years to come.",1483401600,,1043,4.142857142857143

Unless you are a die-hard Star Wars fan that collects light sabers and Darth Vader helmets, you will find no value here.

Long review:
Watched it using Amazon app. Well, it still looks like the first one. I guess this could be good for some people. The problem I find with it is that our world has changed a lot since then.

 What looked good at that time looks pathetic now. For example, my phone can talk to me in good English. Why does that round robot communicates by chirping? Why do the Stormtroopers wear bright wight plastic? That makes them such easy targets. Everything: weapons, spaceships, fights, robots, and actors look just lame.

The general feeling I have after watching this is that the movie was done by early teens for a poorly funded school project.",1483228800,,784,4.618705035971223

There is no way to navigate the bonus features like there is on a DVD - you can only keep going. Using Amazon through a Roku stick on my TV, you could not fast forward and then watch bonus material - the file continually reverted to the beginning, meaning that the only way to watch the bonus material would be simply watch all 4:17 straight through.

7546867,4,B018FK66TU,"Sure, the echos of the original Star Wars are a little too strong with this one. There's a fine line between homage and retread. But seeing this on the big screen and again here on Blu-ray was a sheer joy. This revisit to the Star Wars universe under Disney and JJ Abrams just delivers in ways that Lucas' own prequels didn't. Is this a perfect movie? Nope. But, let's face it, none of the originally trilogy were either.

The Ble-ray presentation, I thought, really delivered. I don't have a tricked out system. A moderate size TV. No surround sound system. This picture still looked and sounded great to me, delivering a full but not too full audio track (if that makes sense).

If you didn't like or enjoy the movie, there is not much to this package to make you want to own it. It comes with some pretty cool extras and features, but it's not one of those ""film school in a box"" time sets where it's worth getting for just the behind the scenes and documentaries.",1482796800,,967,4.426966292134831

It was fun and exciting with a lot of nostalgia and plenty of new stuff. I love that it has a female lead and a lot of other likable characters.

First of all, my boyfriend was impressed and excited by the case itself. The holographic case cover look awesome! It has depth, as if you were looking through a window! The inside also has several stills from the movie and looks great!

It comes with 4 discs. One is a blu ray of special features, one is a DVD of the movie, one is a blu ray of the movie, and the last is the 3D blu ray of the movie. The 3D version truly looks amazing. We both agreed it was our favorite movie to watch in 3D on his TV. It's not too in-your-face, and it really adds a depth and sense of realism to the movie that you can only get with 3D. Note that to use the 3D blu ray, you must have a 3D capable TV as well as pairs of 3D glasses.

7546881,1,B018FK66TU,"Just Crap!

Looked like a bunch of rich kids wanted to play star wars and bought out the glory that was passionately earned from the blood and sweat by George Lucas and his original crew. Lack of ingenuity and intelligence in this movie as well as to the film industry.

Also, this movie was used by many outside influential sources who wanted to put their semi-subliminal agenda into the doggone movie. One, theses sources assuming that they are soo smart for accomplishing the crap they put in it (because of soo many not seeing or caring what they did) and Two, making those who they affected dumber... Here we go Idiocracy... anyone want some electrolytes?

Thanks crap shoot. You really inspired cheap thrills and taboo. Nothing to set people apart from society and everyday smut. Just CRAP!

I remember being in my downstairs and my Dad brings home the VHS of the Original Star Wars in the 90's and asked me if I had ever watched it. I said ""I hadn't"" and that movie was soo far away from anything I had ever seen as well on the market at that time. It was a real brain thinker. A new world to expand consciousness. And it was awesome how they tied the current (at the time) real life societal characters to the actual movie. Like ""Cowboys"" ( Hans Solo)

The Force Awakens movie should have some other Title than ""Star Wars"". I'm true and right to say that to honor Star Wars and what it is, they have to do WAAAaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy better than this to earn the title ""Star Wars"" in the Star wars saga.

I want to see a star wars movie made the same exact way they did it back then... Animatronics and props and such. Kind of like a more Shakespeare way... Idk if that the proper way of explaining it cause I really don't like Shakespeare Shakespeare (if you know what I mean) but like Obi wan Kenobi had more depth and confidence to the wiser. Spaces within the characters communication was well throughout. It might be more expensive and energy to make happen but this is needed to be done in this lifetime. Keep the 3 original movies and put aside the others and remake them how the originals were made. Less computer generated scenes and more real organic meaningful substance.

Try again... Or allow me to show you how.",1482710400,,2227,4.48395061728395

I've always been a fan of Abrams' work, whether it be Lost, Alcatraz,  and the newest Star Trek, but this latest example of forgery is an unacceptable insult to anyone who knows better.

7546966,1,B018FK66TU,"This review is organized into parts: Credibility, what is wrong and why, what is right and why.

This review contains spoilers.

Credibility:
I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life. I have lived the movies, read the books, read the comics, played the games, watched the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (and the original test mini-series Star Wars: Clone Wars), and I am currently watching the series Star Wars: Rebels that is currently in production. I have critically analyzed everything and I have had to go back and re-read / re-watch / re-play books, games, and movies to clear up issues.  For me, Star Wars is my hobby.  And I know most people are not as deep into the universe as I am so I will try my best to make references that are widely known to everyone. With this stated, I shall begin.

What is wrong and why.

The most annoying thing in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (or now commonly referred to by many people as The ""Farce"" Awakens) is also the biggest insult to fans and that is that this movie is basically a rehash of Episode 4 A New Hope.  To elaborate:
There is a kid on a desert world, something happens that throw's this kid's life out of control, this person ends up on the run, this person gets caught up with people from the rebellion -or in this movie ""The Resistance""- and then said person joins this small band of fighters to destroy a giant spherical object that threatens to destroy them and many other things. Sounds familiar right? But the best part about this is that Han Solo bluntly talks about the first death star and says ""so it's big"" lets just do what we did last time and as it ends up, that is exactly what happens. Same plot, same sequence, too much nostalgia.

Kylo Ren:
Seems all dark and evil at first. During the previews I thought that this antagonist was a side apprentice of Darth Sidious (The Emperor) or a part of the Emperor's Hand (Force users given just enough training to allow them to enforce the Emperor's will but weak enough so as to not be able to challenge the Emperor's or Darth Vader's will. (There can only be two Sith at any given time. A Master and an Apprentice. One to embody the Power, the other to crave it. The Rule of Two was set forth by Darth Bane 1000 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin) so as to prevent the Sith from becoming self-defeating and become weaker; this rule is bent a few times here and there but never broken).
However as it turns out Kylo Ren is not even Sith, he is nothing more than a petty little Dark Jedi with made up daddy issues who has autistic childish fits whenever things do not go his way. Instead of punishing failure such as Darth Vader and almost all Sith Lords of the past have done, Kylo Ren will destroy a computer in a fit of random temper-tantrum anger instead of using his hate-fed intellect to solve the problem or punish those who are incompetent (such as Vader did to Captain Nidia in The Empire Strikes Back). In addition to this there is a constant statement of Kylo Ren becoming ""Lost to the Light"" or ""seduced by the Light"". This right here spits in the face of everything that the Dark Side and Light Side are. In The Empire Strikes Back when Luke asks which side is stronger Yoda says to Luke, ""...the Light is stronger, but the Dark Side is more seductive, once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.""  While is it true that people can switch from Light to Dark to Light or vice versa, the Light is not seductive as is stated in this movie. The simple answer is that Kylo Ren is so weak that he cannot even maintain his anger and hate to do what he wants. Every person who has fallen to the Dark Side (Sith and plane Dark Jedi) have done so for a reason that has been thought out; that is they use their intellect to justify their actions. Their reasons could be for power, frustration with something, political reasons, hatred for something, fear, or whatever. The point is that Kylo Ren does not seem to know what he wants, and does not seem to have a reason for being in the dark. He says he wants to finish what Darth Vader started, but Vader never wanted to go into the Dark (however once he was there, he was trapped).  Did anyone bother telling the story of Anakin's fall and return to Kylo Ren? Luke was told by Obi-wan and Yoda. Kylo Ren studied under Luke for a time, and Luke (we can assume) told Leia and Han. So, what is up here?

When Kylo Ren is fighting FN-2187 and Rey at the end, he should have killed them both in seconds given that neither one had had any prior training in the force and as such lacked the ability to throw up a force barrier much less knowledge of that ability. (A force barrier is the most basic of force abilities that prevents a Force user from having their heart crushed or other like internal injury imposed upon them by another Force user (See ""Darth Bane: Path of Destruction"" for clarification)). But let us say for a moment that Rey is having this awakening in the force allowing her some ability. FN-2187 should have still been killed (due to the lightsaber slashing his back and spine), and Rey should have still been killed due to her never having any training and yet facing Kylo Ren who's skills are far superior in all aspects as he was responsible for wiping out Luke's New Jedi Order which means that he would have been facing multiple Jedi at once in lightsaber combat; even if he had help from these ""Knights of Ren"" which are yet to be fully revealed.
Lastly on Kylo, Kylo Rens model looks too much like Darth Revan.
Granted there is a LOT more that I could go on about with Kylo Ren, it would delve more into Star Wars lore than the typical fan would be interested in. Suffice to say that he is a weak little emo wuss who hides behind an ill action of his Grandfather and is so weak that no true teacher of the Dark Side would even consider accepting him as a student.

WHERE is Luke Skywalker?
Oh, he is hiding on an island.
In the old cannon, Lukes New Jedi Order was a force to be reckoned with. Luke allowed his Jedi to take spouses and to love. Also, most New Jedi came from other areas of life. That is, one could have been a dock worker, another could have been a short order cook; point is that they were not taken from parents as little children. Some were, but only with parental consent unlike the old order that simply took the children.
The New Jedi Order fought alongside the new republic for decades because after the Empire fell, there was cleanup from that fall out. Many followers of the Empire tried to start it up again. Also there was a power vacuum that was to be filled; the New Republic stepped in but there were other third parties that tried to take control.
MY POINT is that both the New Republic and New Jedi Order are portrayed as to be so horribly weak that something as disorganized as the First Order (the side Kylo Ren is on) could wipe them out. I want to know why Luke threw in the towel. He knew who he was in the original trilogy, what he was to do. And in the old cannon, Luke suffered many setbacks but always kept moving forward.
This is my opinion on this issue only: it seems to me that Lukes character was completely changed from who he was in Episodes 4, 5, & 6.

Why is the New Republic so weak?
The New Republic and New Jedi Order were parallel in power and strength. For the New Republic to be wiped out when it was (in old cannon) a massive war machine built to protect from the power vacuum aforementioned I want to know where their mussel is.

Whats with this Resistance?
The Rebellion ended after the Empire crumbled and then became the New Republic. The New Republic took out its enemies in an effort to restore freedom to the Galaxy and defend against the new threats that arose as a result of this power vacuum. This Resistance was little more than a ploy at nostalgia and contributed to the rehash of Episode 4.

YOU DESTROYED COURSAUNT?!
This was by far the most baffling thing in the entire movie. Coursaunt is the center of power and government in the Galaxy. One who controls this world controls basically everything. The Ancient Sith knew this, and that is why the sacked it and took control of it and destroyed the Jedi Temple (3,500 BBY). This is why The Emperor worked through politics along with the Sith Lords before him dating all the way back to Darth Bane (1,000 BBY) to control it. For the First Order to destroy Coursaunt does nothing but send power to another planet and plunge the Galaxy into Chaos so fraught with disorganization that not even the most intelligent beings would be able to establish control. I get that the First Order wanted to destroy the New Republic, but this was not the way to do it.  It would be the equivalent of Washington D.C. getting destroyed. Sure the USA would be plunged into Chaos for a time, but ultimately, within a few days to weeks, order would be reestablished except power would be moved to an undisclosed location.

What is Right with this movie.
There are no plot holes in this movie. Everything makes sense from a viewers perspective. After all, it was like that in Episode 4, so its rehash would be the same. The only problem is that the story line of this movie just sucks because of the reasons listed above and many many more. But those many many more reasons are details that only true diehards of Star Wars (such as myself) would take notice of.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do Not Waste Your Time.
Do Not Waste Your Money.

Kids will like this movie because it is all new to them. People unfamiliar to Star Wars will like this movie for the same reason; but they will dislike it more and more as they learn about Star Wars.
I could keep going, but I am tired and chances are that if you read this far, you were already questioning this movies greatness anyways. So to you I say, thank you for your time.

7547002,1,B018FK66TU,"IS THE FORCE AWAKENS A REMAKE OF A NEW HOPE? MORE LIKE AN ANTI-REMAKE: take everything cool about the original and destroy it in the most fan-servicey, patronizing, vapid and moronic way, establishing a cast of despicable, irrational and hollow characters.

Luke's tribulations and development? replaced by Rey who knows every language (from robot to wookie) is good at everything, is unbeatable, has no weaknesses, has no flaws, masters the force instantly and spontaneously dominates the light saber to defeat the bad guy, for no reason other than being a woman. Han Solo the cocky renegade with an attitude and badass pilot skills? replaced by Poe who crashes and dies in the first 15 minutes, but inexplicably shows up alive later. He flaked and quit the most important mission in the entire movie to go chill somewhere and conveniently show up in the 3rd act for no reason other than ...gay vibes?

The funny looking tiny green wise alien? replaced by Moz, a new funny looking tiny *yellow wise alien, now a woman who alerts everyone when Solo arrives at a cantina full of shady bounty hunters (pretty stupid for a thousand-year old Yoda-clone) who also claims to be Chewbacca' boyfriend, because interspecies lovin' is OK in this misguidedly 'progressive' movie (despite the absolute sexlessness and lack of chemistry amonst all actors).

Kylo Ren, a bratty tantrum-trowing Vader wannabe, goth poseur, satan-saber wielder, undisciplined and irrational douchebag with zero tactical skills (except Neo's I-can-stop-lasers-with-my-hand but won't use the force in any significant way again for the remaining of the movie). This dude removes his helmet as soon as he starts interrogating a female prisoner because he's a beta male with confidence issues. Imagine Darth Vader removing his helmet the first time he met Leia in Episode IV. Ren gets harmed by Finn early in a duel and then laughably defeated by Rey (on her first day knowing about the force and the very first instance wielding a saber in her life). Kylo is everything Darth Vader wasn't and apparently knew nothing about grandpa who killed Palpatine, saved the galaxy and redeemed himself to live in spirit form next to yoda and Obi Wan; he could actually be right there by his side to slap some sense into him. The movie is chockfull of similar fan-service scenes.

Then we have new characters like Snoke as the new emperor, except this time a silly giant CG gollum caricature who turns out to be a bizarrely oversized hologram just because ...evil? who's he trying to intimidate? Ren? Then we have Finn, the utterly dumb, useless, compulsive liar who is magically capable of light-sabering around despite being a janitor for the starkiller, who magically knows the single most important weakness of the single most important weapon the first order possesses (which had to be a deathstarwhatever because fan-service). Phasma, the first female storm trooper who does absolutely nothing in the entire movie except chickening out and being responsible for the death of all her friends, coworkers and millions of starkiller dwellers. The list of despicably stupid characters keeps piling.

Finally we have the senile-squad. Luke cashing the easiest paycheck ever for simply frowning and looking flabbergasted for two seconds. Leia reprising Leia, except instead of being a strong female badass this time is now a useless officerwhatever repeating her roll as a rebel, with the same clothes, for the same resistance that overthrew the empire and thus became the status quo ruling over the galaxy for the past 30 years. A shameful worthless parent who abandoned her son for no reason whatsoever. Solo as Solo, except now a geriatric caricature of his past self, who was a war-hero by the end of the episode VI, but went back to smuggling because nothing makes sense in this JJ turd. Best thing he did was die penetrated by his emo kid. Solo also utters the single most patronizing line in the entire script: ""Women always figure out the truth"" you know, because this movie is so politically correct and women are born wise and know everything, and who better than original badboy Han Solo to deconstruct the rollicking borderline sexist bro of the 70s Star Wars.

TL;DR The force awakens featured the most boring, unimaginative, unrelatable, unlikeable and irrational characters not only of any Star Wars film but any science fiction or fantasy film ever. Everything about it reeked of fan-service, JJ Abrams plundered the original trilogy while managing nothing but to make a bland, convoluted and vapid facsimile in it's self-referential writing and fan-boyish direction.

7547046,5,B018FK66TU,"I love everything about Star Wars from all the movies, books, television shows and products for fans of all ages. While, The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie. I did like many characters and ideas from The Force Awakens. First seeing Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2), Chewbacca, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa now known as General Organa, See-Threepio (C-3PO) and the Millennium Falcon. That was so iconic. Some of the new characters like Finn a Stormtrooper who realizes what the First Order is doing is very hateful. Kylo Ren, leader of the Knights of Ren, who we find out is actual Ben Solo, Han and Leia son. Captain Phasma, a female Stormtrooper in chrome-plated armor. The mysterious Maz Kanata, the evil and dark Supreme Leader Snoke and finally Rey, a scavenger who can you the Force. The battles, new planets and all the new characters. What I love most about Star Wars is the questions the movie raises. Who is Supreme Leader Snoke, what are his motives? What will become of characters like Poe Dameron, Finn and Kylo Ren? Who are Rey parents? That was is fun about Star Wars we can all come up with our own theories about what will happen next.",1481241600,,1165,4.715686274509804

7547054,5,B018FK66TU,"Many complain that The Force Awakens is just one big ripoff of previous Star Wars films.  It's true, but only if one is cynical and unwilling to appreciate the purpose of the film and its director, J.J. Abrams.  Abrams, along with screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, set out to re-establish Star Wars on the big screen after the hiatus that followed the Revenge of the Sith.  The prequel trilogy had its detractors and has yet to claim the same cultural significance that the original trilogy possessed, in short, the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, resonate far more strongly than their cinematic successors.  It's probably too much to say the prequels damaged the Star Wars 'brand,' but they failed to elicit the same response and emotional attachment of the original film.  Disney, in turn, needed to re-vitalize the franchise after their four billion dollar purchase for the purpose of selling merchandise and starting up an annual release of films.

The answer was to go back to the beginning and provide a beautiful homage to A New Hope.  The Force Awakens definitely shares elements with A New Hope, but plays knowingly on the past of Star Wars while offering new perspectives and new characters.  You're not watching the same film again, but something of a loose adaptation that resonates with its source material.  For example, Rey is the opposite of Luke, someone who wants to remain on her dusty bowl of a planet, while Luke hungered to leave Tatooine for the stars.  This is true for a lot of the film and its characters, as well its plot beats.  An apt comparison might be Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress and how it influenced A New Hope, there are very close similarities at times, but they're both their own individual films as well.

On a technical level, The Force Awakens is a beautiful film, particularly when set on Jakku.  The richness of the set design throughout the film pulls on the familiar and the new, while the cinematography drew upon the best of the artistic production ideas that encapsulated so many fantastic dreams.  John Williams' music is among his best for the franchise, particularly Rey's Theme, the March of the Resistance, the somber and sad elements of Starkiller Base, and the bittersweet alluding to Han and Leia's themes from original trilogy's scores.

The Force Awakens is a very carefully planned out film, which after looking past superficial criticisms, is a incredible addition to Star Wars cinema.",1481241600,2,2470,4.932367149758454

They were not afraid to get fairly aggressive with the 3d strength which really added a lot of depth and out of screen pop-out, without ever feeling over done. This is 3d done right as it is obvious that the director really filmed/edited with 3d in mind.

I watched this movie in the theater in 3d and hated it (the image quality).  I then watched it in 2d on bluray at home and thought it was much better.  I didn't have high hopes for the bluray 3d version but heard really good things about it. It was one of the most amazing visual movie experiences I have ever had.  I felt like I was watching the movie for the first time. It was so much more immersive.

This is really a bitter-sweet experience as 3d movies have had such a bad reputation because of the terrible job most directors have done.

7547093,3,B018FK66TU,"This review is rated SPOILERIFIC by Fly Casual Podcast. Virgin eyes and ears have been warned.

The Force Awakens is here! FINALLY! After a year and a half of all the news, rumors and outright wackiness (at least from the crew at Fly Casual Podcast), we have our first taste of the new age of Star Wars. JJ Abrams and Disney deliver on the most anticipated movie of the year in a BIG way. As I write, The Force Awakens has been crowned king of the domestic box office with $770 Million in gross receipts and has broken myriad records. Worldwide, the film is currently at $1.5 Billion with the movie opening in China today. The movie is at 93% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Whats not to like about this movie?

There are a million different angles you can take on this, so instead of me trying to rationalize each and show how smart I think I am for having such a broad view, I am just going to give you my background with Star Wars to set the stage for this review so you get the sense from where I am coming. I am a forty-something who has seen all of the films in the theater, albeit A New Hope was at the 1979 re-release. I grew up in the 80s with my Kenner Star Wars toys and have been there since the beginning. I avidly partook in what was called the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU) which is all the books, games, and extra-movie material that came out almost from day one. I am what you would call an uber-fan of Star Wars. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back my favorite of the movies, I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. I love John Williamss scores for the films. I love Ben Burts sound production. When people think of how a laser bolt sounds, they are actually hearing Ben Burt hitting a ground wire on a telephone pole with a wrench and the resulting vibrations. I am deeply entrenched in this stuff to the point that I co-host a Star Wars podcast with other Uber nerds and debate this stuff. I appreciate George Lucass vision, but I am not an apologist. The man has flaws and they were on full display in the prequels. But don't get me wrong; I don't hate the prequels.

Like most people leading up to this movie I had fun debating what we would see with the Disney/JJ Abrams incarnation. Listeners of Fly Casual over the last year and a half know how deeply we delved into these discussions. Its been lots and lots of fun. BUT, would the movie live up to the hype?

As regular listeners of the show know, I was not available on December 17 when the rest of the Fly Casual crew went to see the movie and recorded Episode 70 live, immediately after. Following is my addendum to that episode.

I have now seen the movie 4 times. Believe it or not, I saw it 3 times in the first 24 hours! I didn't realize this until a friend pointed it out. The first was by myself the evening of the 17th. I couldn't see it with the guys, but made it happen later at the 11:15 showing at our local theater. This was by far, my least favorite of the four times due in part to my criticisms of the film, a bladder FULL of Diet Coke, and over 3 hours of run time when you include trailers!

My second viewing was the next day with my business partner. We skipped out and saw the film at the same theater at the 11 AM showing. My criticisms remained, but my under-control-bladder situation helped immensely with increased enjoyment levels. Later the same evening, my kids begged me to take them, so whats a dad to do? I felt pretty much the same at this viewing that I did at the viewing earlier in the day, but we were in a different theater that had the volumes MUCH higher and at a far more enjoyable level for me.

My final viewing was in IMAX 3D. Now, our local IMAX theaters aren't true 70mm, but I am not a fan of 3D to begin with and this viewing did little to change that. I am not sure that seeing the film in 70mm would have helped, BUT the sound was even better with the demonstrably superior sound system in the theater.

So lets just get this out there now. I am not gaga over the film as most people are and the way that most of my cohorts on Fly Casual are. I don't dislike the film. It was good! It has some very strong points. But the movie is not the home run I had hoped for leading up to its release.  So lets get into the nitty gritty.

The Good

Going into the film, EVERYONE was buzzing about the practical effects that JJ Abrams planned to employ in the film. For the most part, he did not disappoint. Many felt like one of the things that made the original trilogy great was Lucass limitations with special effects that forced him to rely on landscapes and well-conceived camera angles to deliver his film. When the effects-heavy prequels rolled around, Lucas seemingly forgot what made the originals great and embraced what many feel were lifeless performances by his actors due to lack of directing and nothing but green-screen sets to play off while delivering their performances. Abrams seems to have found the right balance of special effects and live sets. The film certainly felt more grounded, even if some of the sets and landscapes were too reminiscent of past films. If it looks like Tatooine and sounds like Tatooine and smells like Tatooine then why are we on Jakku????

In my opinion, Daisy Ridley stole the show. The character Rey was the right amount of everything: vulnerable, strong, gorgeous, expressive, funny, and Roberta Badass. Some are actually criticizing the character as being a Mary Sue, but I am all about it. She is definitely the new Luke in the series and I am excited about having an intriguing female character like this being the new lead in Star Wars.

Lupita Nyongos character, Maz Kanata, almost, stole the show from Rey almost. By far she had my favorite line in the movie, Wheres my boyfriend? I love that Wookie. The character is a Yoda analogue; a character that has been around for a millennia and has seen it all. With lines like, I have lived long enough to see the same eyes in different people. I see your eyes. I know your eyes one would think that in order to portray such a deep character you would need a wizened sage of an actor. Well look no further than barely-30-something Nyongo. Her performance was brilliant.

Han Solo is one of those iconic characters you don't want to screw up. Everyone is thankful for Harrison Ford and his $23 million return to the role. Han and Chewie are definitely a highlight of the film. There were a few times that Ford showed his age (running away from rathtars) and one time that Abrams skated dangerously close to the absurd (no-look shooting). But he represented the old guard well going toe to toe with Ridley and Boyega. He brilliantly portrayed a still brash and reckless Han Solo who IS 30 years older AND wiser. He will be missed from the franchise.

I don't want to say that John Boyegas character Finn was the surprise hit of the film, but it felt that way to me. By all accounts leading up to the film, he was a talented actor and was expected to be the next Luke Skywalker in the series. I shouldnt have been surprised, but I was because going in, our only real exposure to him was one or two lines in the trailers and a lot of desert sweating. A LOT of sweating. To my delight, I loved Finns character, who, by the way, is closer to a Han Solo than a Luke Skywalker. Finn is a loner who wants to run away as far as he can from the First Order. He does this to the point that he is lying to EVERYONE around him about his true intentions. If not for his affinity for Rey, he would have been long gone, much like Hans affinity for Leia in the original trilogy and desire to have nothing to do with the Rebellion. He was certainly a heavy part of the comic relief. I am interested to see where this character goes. I think I know where just about everyone else is going. Finn is up in the air.

Adam Drivers character Kylo Ren has received mixed reviews from the people with whom I have spoken. Most critics are saying that he is not evil enough to be the new trilogys villain. He is whiny and out of control. To me, these are the things I LOVE about him. Here is a darkside Force user who is being tempted by the LIGHT! He is a Skywalker! I am actually glad that we have a villain that isn't a scarred-beyond-recognition-amputee! I want to know more about him. Why did he betray Luke and the Jedi? What happened during the rebellion? Why is he so obsessed with Vader? How does Snoke play into his betrayal. I also thought that despite having to set up this character very fast to get to the payoff of the Solo death scene, both he and Ford played it as well as it could be played. From the tear shedding by Ren that had us believing for a moment that he was going to go with his father to the final touch of Solos hand on Rens face. Kudos on the performance. I am a fan.

The Bad

Anyone who knows me understands that Luke was my hero growing up. The day I heard we were getting Ep VII and that the original cast was back I started conjuring images in my mind of Lukes return to the silver screen and the badassery that must ensue. Fast forward to December 18. Saying I was a little disappointed would be an understatement. I get it. The movie turned into the quest for Luke. Rumors early on were suggesting a very limited role for Mark Hamill in the film. I was somewhat prepared, but I really didn't think we wouldnt even be getting a single line from Luke. Listeners of Fly Casual know about what we call the Fan Boy Wet Dream. In said dream scenario our hope was more along the lines of Luke being found and participating in the final battle sequences. Instead we get a robed figure turning around and pulling down his hood. Que music. I am taking this as well as I can and hoping for previously mentioned badassery to commence in VIII AND IX. Dont let me down Rian!

John Williams is THE MAN! He has written every major movie score important to me throughout my youth, formative years, and adulthood. The man is a genius with scores like Star Wars, ET, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Harry Potter, and a million others. The man is also 83 years old. The score for this film felt like an 83 year old man wrote it. What I mean is that it is not very memorable. With the exception of classic trilogy themes, I really don't remember the soundtrack at all. Even though Attack of the Clones is my least favorite of the films, I still remember the Anakin/Padme love theme which was brilliant. The best I can say about the new score is that I remember hearing the Rey theme and remember liking it, but please don't ask me to hum it. This is more than a little disappointing. Part of the problem is that the sound track in general is mixed poorly in my opinion (see The Ugly below). It feels like JJ called up Williams, and in his head was like, What?! Another one? They paid him a bajillion dollars and he futzed his way through it. I will be frankly surprised if he returns for VIII at 85 years old. I think they should have thought more long term, ripped off the Band-Aid, and made the change now.

I remember our very first cast of Fly Casual in the summer of 2014 and talking about Disney choosing JJ Abrams to direct. We saw JJs involvement as a double edged sword. We all knew what he could do with look and feel through Super 8 and the Star Trek reboots. But one of our earliest criticisms of him was that he tended to sacrifice story and originality for said look and feel. The more the rumors and images poured in over the next year and a half, the more concerned we became. Unfortunately he did not prove us wrong. In many many ways, this film is almost a complete replica of A New Hope complete with desert dwellers, a  young idealistic kid, a sage old man, a rogue, droid carrying secret data, a masked villain, and on and on and on. After seeing The Force Awakens, I am happy that JJ was involved, but I am somewhat relieved he won't be back for snow planets, metal walking tanks, and a city in the clouds called Jackee in Ep VIII.

Can anyone explain who or what is the Republic? I thought there should be more exposition there. Now I do realize that the Empire was pretty vague at the time of A New Hope, but I think that was out of necessity at that time. I think they could have been clearer about the status of Coruscant and the New Republic.

Captain Phasma: wait, what?

Rathtars: Unnecessary. Didnt feel like Star Wars.

The Ugly

Alluded to above, my biggest complaint with this film, by FAR, is the sound track. By soundtrack, I don't mean the just the music. The music was only the tip of the ice berg. I mean the sound effects, the music, and the mix. Why they felt like they had to completely recreate the sound of laser bolts is beyond my comprehension. When they purchased Lucasfilm, they inherited Ben Burts sound library complete with the most recognizable laser sound effects in existence. When someone describes a laser blast, I would argue that most people hear Ben Burts version in their head. Suddenly laser rifles sound like crappy 1970s sci-fi. I was stunned. Even light sabers were changed. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU SCREW UP LIGHT SABERS?! Ill even give them a pass on Kylo Rens lightsaber since it is unique. But Skywalkers light saber sounded more like a jet engine! Part of the reason none of the music was memorable to me is that I couldn't hear it most of the time. Foreign Correspondent Steve Potter in the UK shares many of my criticisms of the film. He has told me that he has purchased the musical score and after listening to it, isolated from the film, he actually likes it. If that is the case, if there really is good music to present, why the hell is it tucked so deep into the sound track?

After my first viewing of the film, I was downright mad. Now part of that was because of previously said full bladder. But even after my second and third viewing, that criticism remained. I will admit that at my 4th viewing at the IMAX Theater, I was able to hear many of the classic and familiar sounds I missed in previous viewings, BUT I still had to concentrate to hear them. I felt like the soundtrack was REALLY rushed on this film almost to the point that the film was unrecognizable and unenjoyable to me. Call me an uber-nerd if you want and you're probably right that most people don't care or recognize this as a problem, but I do. With JJ Abrams reputation for look and feel, this was an unexpected misstep in my opinion.

As previously discussed, JJs return to the well of A New Hope was a noticeable problem. The icing on the cake is Deathstar 3, aka Starkiller Base. This was an absolute eye roller to me. There HAD to be another way to bring the film to a climatic end. That was just damn poor writing, Mr. Kasdan. When the Resistance was in the war room and Poe pulled up the side-by-side of the Deathstar and Starkiler base, I thought I was going to lose it. JJ is getting a LOT of flack right now from Lucas and other critics for making a nostalgia film. Had there not been a Deathstar 3, I would stand in defense of him. He honestly deserves all the criticism he gets for that one. This is a total lack of creativity in my opinion.

My final criticism of the film will only be relatable to fans of the EU. Many of us waited eagerly to see if beloved EU characters Jacen & Jaina (Han and Leias twin children) would make their big screen debut in The Force Awakens in the form of Kylo Ren and Rey. We knew there was at best a 50/50 chance these characters would transition over to the New Canon (or Disneys newly established Star Wars timeline which renders most of the prior EU irrelevant). But not only did they tell us that Jacen and Jaina will not exist, but they also flipped us the bird when they revealed Kylo Rens birth name to be Ben Solo. You see, in the old EU, Lukes sons name was Ben. I know some in my circle of friends are patiently waiting and hoping for revelations/explanations or even other EU characters to end up in the movies. In my mind this is a clear sign that the EU will have no place in the new movies, and frankly, this disappoints me. I will still enjoy the films. I enjoyed this film. But it would have been nice to feel like the filmmakers threw the uber-fans a bone.

The Lowdown

Star Wars films evolve over time with me. Right now, I cant give this film more than 3 out of 5 stars. Good movie. I really enjoyed it. My kids enjoyed it. The film will become part of my collection. But it just doesnt have the classic feel with me yet. I am not certain about the staying power. I will say that I am glad that there is mystery returning to the saga. With the prequels, you always knew where they were headed. That is an inherent problem with prequels. With these new sequels, anything is possible again and THAT is exciting!

Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in the sci-fi/space genre, if not the most popular movie franchises in existence. This being said, there was a lot of pressure on the entire cast and production team to make a movie that would stand up to everyone's expectations... Of course it would fall short with some people and far exceed others expectations. Whether you loved or hated it, or fell somewhere in-between, this movie raked in some money and good reviews!

I am of the opinion of some of the haters out there, but without the resulting 1 or 2 stars... This movie took too much time, almost reenacting A New Hope, the first Star Wars movie from 1977. I feel like more than 70% of this movies was recycled/regurgitated plot points, but with modern day graphics, storytelling, and flair that only JJ Abrams could provide. I am not going to give examples for fear of spoilers.

The reason I can say these negative things and keep it at a 4 star rating is because of the Hope of awesome things to come! And that it was Amazing to the Han, Chewie, and the Falcon again!",1480550400,3,1338,4.4089068825910935

I absolutely HATED this movie. It's just a New New Hope with a bunch of plot holes and unjustifiable scenes, like the crashed tie fighter that gets eaten by the desert for apparently no reason.

However, the 3D visuals were fun enough to make me forget about how bad the story is.

Took one star off for slightly wonky 3D. There were some scenes that ghosted pretty bad. It makes me think Star Wars was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D.",1480464000,,519,4.275510204081633

7547127,1,B018FK66TU,"The only saving grace of this film is Daisy Ridley's performance, she bring more emotion to her character than we've ever seen in a stars wars movie, and her character is very empowering for young girls. A big improvement from Manikin Skywalker from the prequels. BUT...

So many missed opportunities for a good story. What we got instead was a rehashing of old ideas. They missed by not giving us much of a back story on Finn. Seeing the war from a storm troopers point of view would have been cool, but no. Maybe some story about Poe, and how he became this legendary pilot, sorry no. Maybe come up with a new evil weapon other than a larger death star, destroyed again by a fighter in a trench run, nope recycled again. Even the villain was a generic fan boy version of Vader. Ford and Fisher don't seem to be taking any of it seriously as they plan the attack at the rebel base. Even Ridley character was lacking any real back story, orphan abandon on a desert world. Again nothing new. Hopefully with Abrams out of the way they can make it up in episodes 8 & 9.

And now sadly Rouge One will be another death star movie. At least with the prequels Lucas tried to introduce some new ideas, and spin some of the back story points.",1480464000,,1233,4.333333333333333

7547148,3,B018FK66TU,"I realize now that my thoughts on this movie have changed from when it originally came out.  Upon viewing it on opening night in December 2015 I think the initial excitement of a new Star Wars film caused me to have an elevated opinion of this movie.  However, even as I was leaving the theater I had some disappointment.  My biggest issue with Ep 7 is overuse of nostalgia, which I think takes too much away from the development of the new characters.  Yes, it was great seeing Han, Chewie, Leia, R2 and 3PO but it felt like more of a Star Wars reunion special then it did a new installment of a Star Wars film.  I also felt that there was too much confusion about who the First Order, the Republic, and the Resistance all were.  I have read in other commentaries that there is more explanations in the novels about these groups...but we shouldn't all have to go and read the books in order understand the films. There could have at least been some sort of dialogue about why there is a resistance and a First Order.

I'm hoping for much more in Ep 8, more development of the new characters and less nostalgia.  Hey, this was still a cool movie and hopefully it will fit in nicely in the grand scheme of Episodes 1-9.  I hope that when all is said and done this isn't the one that gets thrown aside like Phantom Menace.",1480118400,10,1320,4.3117408906882595

I'm not going to hash on the movie itself - I believe there's already 10K reviews on this film already LOL
I'd just like to give a quick Audio/Video review of this Blu-Rey Disc - First of all this has got be my newest ""Reference"" Blu-Rey Disc, previously it was The Dark Knight BD.
The picture quality is outstanding, if your HDTV is of at least halfway decent this Disc will bring out the best of it. I have a 65"" Samsung Curved Ultra-HD Television and the picture is outstandingly amazing, like seeing it again in the theater!!!
The audio quality is great. The volume differential between the special effects and the spoken dialog can be big at times, making it very loud when there are explosions, but that gives a true cinematic experience. My set up is a 5.1 surround system. The disc's surround track is in 7.1 channels but I can't review that fully. The 7.1 channel track ""Down-Mixes"" to 5.1 channels just fine.)
The sound setting when on DTS Master Audio 7.1 is also crazy good. My rear surrounds get alot of work from this Blu-Rey.

7547196,5,B018FK66TU,I was initially annoyed at Disney for releasing the 3D version of this Blu Ray so much later but clearly they have spent some serious time on this.  This is one of the best looking 3D Blu Rays out there. It's absolutely stunning.  The 3D at home looks better than it did when I saw it at the IMAX.  It's a shame that 3D home movies wasn't marketed correctly to the home audience and more people don't take advantage of this wonderful technology.  If you love 3D movies this one is a must have.

They put out the DVD/Bluray months ahead of the 3d one then releases the 3d one hoping to get people to purchase the same movie twice.  That is evil really.  In addition, I did see this movie in the theater in 3d and there was minimal 3d effects.  Really only two good parts.  The opening credits is cool as the words go up the screen in 3d.  And then there is a pointy ship that is just pointing off the screen, but other than that really a 3d disappointment.  You would think Star Wars would be the perfect movie to make in 3d.  Lazy effort here.  As for the movie itself it was entertaining enough.  Don't want to spoil the plot, but days later I thought this really could have been much better.  They really did not take advantage of the 3 main actors returning.  Harrison Ford gets some decent screen time, but the other two get little.  And in fact would have been nice to see a scene with them all in it.  Wasted opportunity.  Most importantly AVOID the 3D version!",1479600000,7,1092,4.202898550724638

As a huge Star Wars fan, this movie made me (metaphorically) write a blank check to Disney. Although we as fans crave the untainted (by ""studio execs"") artistic vision of the Star Wars mythos on the big screen, it helps to make sure being an entertaining and good quality movie are priorities for the series moving forward. Sure, the prequels may have been Lucas' unchallenged vision for the series (or maybe not), but just maybe if there had been enough dissenting voices during the production process, Lucas' classic story-telling archetypes of the fallen hero and the transition from democracy to tyranny could have been realized in a much grander way.",1479340800,4,994,4.958083832335329

7547264,4,B018FK66TU,"EDITED AFTER TESTING

Original review:
Testing on Xbox One, which plays all the 20+ other 3D Blu rays I have, this 3D blu ray disc isn't reading as 3D.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the Xbox one blu ray app in case it required a newer version and it was the same result.  The disc plays but only shows 2D.  I triple checked to make sure I had the correct disc in there.  ;)

Testing on PS4 the 3D disc works correctly and displays in full 3D (and it is very nice looking).

It's not clear if the fault is with the disc, the mastering, or the Xbox One app not being updated with some new protocol, but if you only have an Xbox One you're not going to have a good 3D time right now.  Knocking off a star for this.

--------------------

Update 11-23-2016:

The newest firmware update had no effect.  However, Jaime Rivera has posted a workaround for Xbox One in the comments on this post.  I'm copying it here for convenience.

How to get this working in 3D in XB1:

1. Put your SW EP7 3D into the XBOX ONE (with 3D enabled).
2. When it starts, you'll see that the display is on 2D.
3. Press the X botton on the Xbox Controller to go to the main menu with the Bluray APP still running.
4. Go to settings, and then go to Display Settings.
5. Disable the 3D setting.
6. Press the X botton to go to the main menu and then open the bluray app to see if the movie is still running.
7. Press X again and go back to the display settings.
8. Enable the 3D option.
9. Go back to the bluray app and see if its running on 3D now.
10. Enjoy.

--------------------------

I have verified that this method works on my XB1 as well.

There hasn't been a determination of where the fault lies, but at least we can enjoy the movie in 3D.

Testing notes:
originally tested on first gen XB1 > Denon receiver > LG OLED55C6P

7547292,5,B018FK66TU,"If you are a Star Wars fan, chances are you already own a copy of this movie in one format or another.  If you own any sort of 3D projector or TV, this is a must.  I was quite pleasantly surprised when my package arrived and noticed it was quite larger than an average Blu-Ray.  It is hard to tell from the picture used on this listing, but the packaging is not a blue clam-shell like you get with normal Blu-Ray movies It is a much prettier, thicker, box much like the two trilogy Blu-Ray box set.  If you have a collection of physical media movies, this one will not blend in with the others.

Now... Let's hope they don't do this double-dip with Rogue One as well....  Obi-Wan?  A little help with that please.",1479168000,12,713,4.237037037037037

It's not perfect by any means, and it tries to mirror the original series in many places a bit too much, but the characters are likable, the humor and light heartedness fits, and the Force feels like the Force and not power level/midichlorians BS.

Start off with a New Hope, continue through to the Force Awakens (and beyond, depending on when you're reading this) and only introduce your kids to the prequel movies as a cautionary tale of what not ever to do or like in movies.",1479168000,2,511,4.494623655913978

There was really no reason to come out with another one - episode VI, the 3rd film, closed everything up in the tidy manor and there was really no reason to come out with this 7th film.

The original release includes the blu ray disc, the DVD and the digital HD disc. That means that I now have 1 3D blu ray, 2 blu rays, 2 DVD's and 2 digital HD discs all of the same movie.

Feel the force, you will know this to be true.  Star Wars has never been about big name stars.  This could have been written without the need to pay the big money for the now big name.  I really like the two main characters.  Maz is a great alien that I hope to see in the next movie.
Even with the facts of this movie, I like it enough that I have watched it twenty times so far including once with my eyes closed to visualize it in my head.  One thing I could not figure out is how to take that mass of a sun and store it in a small planet.  Come guys, a little Sci to go with the Fi.",1478995200,,754,3.6855345911949686

Of course, none of the newer Star Wars movies are much to write home about so this one isn't much worse than the others, maybe even a little better.  It did have some decent actions scenes, some good acting (Daisy Ridley in particular) and glimpses of greatness, but not enough.

7547341,3,B018FK66TU,"It was a good movie however, Hollywood lied when it advertised it as a new Star Wars movie. It's essentially episode VI: A New Hope with new characters and plot twists. Don't get me wrong, the new characters are entertaining and engaging. The special effects are awesome but you know you've seen it before. If you haven't then this really becomes a 4.5 to 5 star movie.

[SPOLER ALERT -- stop reading if you haven't seen it disclaimer]

It's essentially a battle to kill a deathstar, sorry a bigger deathstar called a Starkiller Base. In order to kill it you have to do a deathstar run and shoot missiles into a ""special"" reactor port. My issue is that if it was marketed as a reboot and I made a choice to see it anyway then I'd enjoy it more being fully informed. With this movie, Lucasfilm, Disney and J.J.

Overall I liked the movie and the bigger story.  Awesome seeing the old gang again  (wanted more).  The new gang seems cool.  I liked Rey, she just seems cool.  BB-8 was awesome!  I liked Finn too, and curious how his part will play out. As far as Kylo, interesting.  F him that he killed his Dad.  However, that is now a classic moment in Star Wars.

There are probably plenty of things to tear apart from this movie, if one wanted to.  The two things that stand out to me, is Rey certainly got handy in the Force awfully fast.  If you gave it any though, I mean it was utter ridiculous.  Subtle uses would have made sense, but what she was doing kind of goes against the whole Star Wars universe.  I mean she was kicking a guys ass who has been training for years with it (yes, he has issues), and she didn't even know she had it, until then, and clearly was never trained.  BAD.  The other part, I felt was an insult.  Han Solo dies, they fly back, land, and who does the damn princess hug?  A STRANGER.  Not Chewbacca, Hans Solos best friend for most his life (and a life long friend of the princess too), but a F N STRANGER.  This was the most disappointing thing in the movie to me.  Not sure how they came up with that one, but talk about f'ing up.",1478131200,,1417,4.132841328413284

Very much evokes an early Luke Skywalker, with more skill and potential. And just a hint of darkness (like Luke) that foreshadows a conflict she'll probably have to face. Not sure why Han didn't seem to know more about her?

7547423,3,B018FK66TU,"I think context is an important thing when reading a review.  I wouldn't call myself a rabid Star Wars fan - it always was a bit shallow in the storyline department.  However, the original Star Wars trilogy had a certain spark that just made the ride enjoyable.  Perhaps it was the mystery or the grand adventure of it all.

JJ Abram's reboot might be a bit better than the last installments but ultimately I felt little to entice.  Despite the big budget effects, it often seems rather low budget.  I have been surprised at the project given to this director which I would consider to be some of the most horrific hack jobs ever released (Star Trek: Into Darkness) Some scenes are so flat, that I am surprised Disney exec didn't have a fit wondering where there money was being spent.  Rey was a surprise in that this character actually brings some emotional depth to the film.  On the other hand, Finn is awful.  One moment a coward, the next a hero willing to easily kill the conscripts he was once a part of.  His entire backstory is so horribly flawed as to be laughable (wait you have been a conscript from birth and this is the first battle you've ever been in???)  The other dismal failure is the First Order.  There is nothing about the First Order that makes their place in the Universe seem relevant.

Basically, it is best not to think too much about the storyline - as there are way too many flaws if one over-analyzes.  The film is an enjoyable carnival ride that will likely join many of the flashy, but weak movies of the modern era and be forgotten easily.",1477612800,,1573,4.454545454545454

Rae and Finn are both extremely young and possessed of insufficient experience to explain their miraculous flying (Rae), shooting (Finn), and light saber combat (both) skills. This is a pervasive problem in the sequel industry wherein each successive film seems to be the result of the misguided assumption that only by increasing the drama, danger, damage, and power can one produce a good film.  The Force began as a highly esoteric power that very few could tap. In ""The Force Awakens,"" the market is flooded, many characters can do cool Force things. Consequently, its value as a rarified, magical reservoir to be tapped into by only the most dedicated acolytes has plummeted.

I want 3D. I want 4k. I *want* to pay for both, and I know there's little chance you haven't had them all ready to go for some time now. What I'm not willing to do is buy three different sets for $30 a pop as you trickle them out over the course of a year, long after any other studio would have released whatever they had to offer.

As it stands, we've both lost. You lost because you threw the money I would have spent on a reasonably priced release with 3D and/or 4k versions of this film. (I'll give you a little bit of a pass on 4k *this time only* because the format is still new.) I lost because I won't get to enjoy the first Star Wars movie in over 10 years in the best quality you have to offer. Beyond that, you've managed to remove any incentive I might have had to complete my own personal 3D and 4k set, because I'm certainly not going to buy this single movie three separate times and I _know_ you'll be releasing numerous box sets with those versions (and equivalent versions of films yet to be released) in the future. Because what else should we expect from Disney at this point.

So, Disney, in the future please do us all a favor. Don't trickle out even basic editions of your movies that should have been available from the start slowly, over a period of months or even years. Give the fans of the franchises you own the best experience up front, and maybe, if you *really* can't stand to do things any other way, come out with a special edition down the line. If you do right by your fans to start with, maybe they'll be willing to pay a premium on occasion for extended or otherwise enhanced editions in the future.",1477353600,9,1647,4.222222222222222

Maybe he will be better defined as a character in the next movie. The movie leaves you with many more questions than answers, but they do have two more movies in the trilogy to make up for that.

Brilliant acting. Brilliant directing. The music is flawless. It hurts. It is scary. It is exciting. It is funny (Han and Chewie have my favorite banter out of all of the films). It is hopeful.

7547559,5,B018FK66TU,"In response to those angry about the 3D release 7 months later... A lot of movies, specifically Disney movies, had 3D Blu-ray release dates, only to be ultimately canceled in the US. Frozen 3D. Big Hero 6 3D. Maleficent 3D. Ratatouille 3D. All of these Disney flicks once had US 3D Blu-ray release dates that never ultimately came to fruition, though they were all released in 3D in other parts of the world. The point is, just because there's a release date for a 3D version, it doesn't mean it'll actually happen. That's why I bought TFA when it first came out on Blu-ray, and that's why I'll buy the 3D version if it ever actually gets here. I absolutely would've preferred the 3D version back in April 2016, and I agree that it's absolute BS that may finally be released 7 months later. But on the flipside, I'm just happy I'll get to have the 3D version at all. Plus, new special features to boot!

The video was excellent.  Of course, because I am a fan of the series, and also because I think Harrison Ford is an excellent actor, my opinion is biased.  I read the reviews about this film before I went to see it in the theatre, so I am aware that Harrison Ford was not eager to do yet another Star Wars story, so I was not surprised that Han Solo was killed in the last film. [spoiler alert] I was surprised that he was, in fact, murdered by his own son, but somehow that seemed like a classic ""Dark Force"" outcome.

7547581,5,B018FK66TU,"Absolutely fantastic! In the spirit of the original trilogy, JJ Abrams has recaptured George Lucas's original vision, introducing great new characters and bringing back some old favorites. While I did have one little bone to pick with Abrams about the death of Han Solo (that should not be a spoiler because every true Star Wars fan should have seen the movie by now), I later found out that it was Harrison Fords idea to kill off his character. But I do commend Abrams and his writing staff on how they handled it in true Star Wars fashion. The special effects were awesome, but not over the top (which I think the prequels suffered from), there is a great story here and the ""cliff hanger"" has us all on the edge of our seats eagerly anticipating the next installment. I can honestly say I have watched this movie almost a hundred times since its release and subsequent availability on Amazon and it never gets old. In fact, every time I do watch it, I find a detail I missed previously.

7547586,5,B018FK66TU,"Not quite as good as the original trilogy, but close -- and better than the second trilogy. When I saw this in the theatre, the biggest (and happiest) surprise was -- THIS IS A HARRISON FORD FILM.  He has arguably a bigger and better role here than in ""Return,"" plus his acting has improved. Older Han is sadder and wiser -- and still dominates every scene he's in.

The other pleasure was in the writing -- several times, the lines were truly fresh and caught me off-guard, usually with humor.

Of the new players, Daisy Ridley gets an A, John Boyega a B, and the others - we'll see how they pan out. Also, another great Andy Serkis motion-capture creation in Snoke.

The original BR / DVD is disappointing, in that there's no J.J. Abrams commentary (his are usually excellent). . . . but wouldn't you know, there is now a ""Special Edition"" that DOES have commentary . . . grrrrrr",1476144000,,881,4.453416149068323

Recycled iconic Star Wars story lines, you know who you are.  Annoying.  Disappointing at times.  Still a great movie with action sequences eye-popping enough to be worthy of mention in the archives of the Jedi Order.  Poignant yet silly final scene, we are left to ponder a plethora of possible sequels, all of which will likely include a strong female character who can aggressively negotiate with a light saber.

7547727,4,B018FK66TU,"It's Star Wars, so I like the movie. But, when I saw this movie in the theater, I wasn't impressed like a lot of my friends were. This movie is too predictable, basically copying bits/pieces from several of the others - it starts on a sandy planet; there's a 'hermit jedi'; there's yet another death star of sorts; blah, blah, blah. Actually, the movie is pretty unoriginal. And, I really don't care for ""Fin"". He's kind of annoying.

But, aside from all of that, it is Star Wars and I like sci-fi in general. Some of the action scenes are pretty good & I think Maz is kinda funny :)

Although, if I was able to rate the movie 3 1/2 stars instead of 4, I would. If you like Star Wars, or sci-fi movies in general, yes... I would recommend this purchase.",1475193600,3,753,4.258741258741258

7547730,5,B018FK66TU,"Yes it pretty much followed the framework of ""A New Hope.""  I didn't care.  I loved it.

I cant remember where, but I read or I heard one person's review of the movie, and I can see their perspective: that of Han's character and his storyline in the movie.  In the original trilogy, Han is this ""me-first"" guy who could give a rat's keyster about the Empire.  By the end of Return of the Jedi, he's with Leia, he's an officer in the Rebellion, and overall he's redeemed himself.  Fast-forward 30 years later: his relationship with Leia is destroyed, his kid is a jerk, he's broke, he's still trying to swindle everyone....all that goodwill built up in the OT was ""pooped on"" for lack of a better term.

Apart from THAT.... I let pretty much everything go and enjoyed the ride of the movie.",1475107200,,789,4.4375

Two of my children saw THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK with me and have been serious fans since that time
I saw first SW age 31 out of Grad. School Greatest space adventure I have Ever view and Darth Vader I was a fan Forever.
My children now in their FORTIES and I Saw AWAKENING together last year. Wonderful Experience.

I really enjoyed it despite this but if they had come up with something other than Deathstar Mk III for the Starkiller base I'd be giving it 5 stars. The superweapon was kind of an issue with the canon pre Disney. Personally a ""basic"" star destroyer is super weapon enough if shown correctly. I mean, what would be worse to see? Planets being completely destroyed or the slow destruction of a planet as a star destroyer turned each continent to molten rock? Both are bad but the last could provide more drama, presuming there is time. (Okay, it might be better if it was part of one of the animated shows).

As it is I really like Rey and Fin.

7547848,4,B018FK66TU,"I watched the original Star Wars back in, was it 1978? Where did the time go?

No one who was not living then can truly understand the excitement of that film. People are very jaded today. It's not like it was back then. You couldn't pick up a DVD of the film and go watch it at home. I went to the actual MOVIES and saw the first Star Wars about 6 times......I loved it, it was unlike anything anyone had seen before.

The special effects were just awesome. I still remember the gasp in the audience the first time the Falcom Milenium JUMPED into hyper-space. And the reaction to the very opening of the film, showing the under side of this huge spacecraft.

I went home blasting away with an imaginary space-gun. It was like a different world then. I've forgotten when the first VHS machine was put on the market, but that invention plus personal computers, then the iphones....it IS truly culture shock.

 I was pretty bored at the beginning (yeah, just another bunch of special effects explosions, yada yada)  involving people I cared nothing about (except I liked the droid, so cute)

Once Hans Solo arrived the entire tone changed, here was Harrison Ford, a REAL actor.......I didn't appreciate just how good he is until he brought this rather lackluster movie to life.

I loved all the references to the first star wars, and I was waiting to see Luke.

spoilers ahead

DID NOT like the ENDING at ALL! They did not need to kill him off, they could have 'passed the baton' on without doing that. I'm still half expecting Luke to have somehow 'saved' him magically without anyone knowing, but that's not likely. They need to at LEAST have a real sort of funeral/send-off/show him safe with 'The Force' or SOMETHING!

I'm thinking that having Luke present in the next film might carry it forward, we'll see......",1474329600,,1815,4.605590062111801

If you don't want to buy it three times don't buy this one, as a future boxed set (or multiple sets, or a future 4K set)will surely be released. It's not Disney's fault if you don't have common sense. They have been doing this for years and will continue to do it. I myself bought it, watched it, and sold off the separate parts (Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy) at a profit knowing this was coming.
Disney did not ""force"" you to buy the first version, nor are they requiring you to buy this version. If you don't want to buy it twice, don't buy it twice. If you don't like the way they do things don't buy their products. It's that simple.
If you already own it and just want the 3D disc, check eBay after it comes out, as many people don't own a 3D TV and will sell that disc separately.
The movie itself to me was 3.5/5, enjoyable but way too many repeated plot points, but I'm giving 5 stars just to offset all the whining 1 star reviews.
Will actually update the 3D once I get it, as I've watched about 50 movies at home in 3D, some great, some ok, some not worth the 3D watch at all.",1474156800,12,1339,4.056603773584905

In regards to the 3D, the film itself was great in theaters in 3D and since 3D looks better at home, I am very excited for this. I only wish that Disney would release the rest of the films in 3D for home video when they regain the rights back.

The strength of the 3D I would say is Moderate, there are a few shots that seem to come out of the screen. The depth of the 3D isn't as strong as most Disney cartoon films, though stronger than films shot natively on 3D such as X-Men. If you are going to watch any 3D film, this is definitely one of the films to have at the top, if not THE top of your list.

This is Precisely what diminishes sympathy for piracy, and if you're some sort of corporate appologist get out of my face with that. I DID look it up before and there was no mention of a 3D release.

7547924,5,B018FK66TU,"TFA is a great way to ""awaken"" the thirty year old Star Wars universe. People like to say the similarities between it and New Hope make it awful, but I think it's great. It's still Star Wars, after all! It takes place in the same universe, with new bad guys that were born out of the same regime from the original trilogy, with many of the same characters (or their kids). Of course the First Order is going to mimic the Empire when it was build out of the remnants of the old Empire! Of course Kylo Ren is going to try to mimic Vader, when he clearly idolizes him. Of course we're going to get a new scrappy desert-rat who turns out to be a mythical Jedi--Star Wars is about Jedi!

The script is great, the cinematography is fantastic, and they have a great group of actors--new and old--to execute it. It's great.",1473897600,,815,4.292207792207792

Spoiler alert;
I was quite frustrated that after the death of our beloved character H.S. and Chewie returns he and Lea never greet one another, cry together or even acknowledge that Chewies best friend and Lea's love of her life just died....Don't you think they would embrace and cry together since Chewie saved Lea's life over and over and was Han's best friend.....How could the writers and director miss that opportunity to strengthen the bond of Chewie and Lea not to mention make the story line more believable and acceptable.....Oh well....that's Hollywood for ya.....",1473724800,,776,4.7555555555555555

I will review the packaging.
I like the black case, but I despise the disc mounting. There are indeed 3 discs, the DVD is on the left pane and the 2 Blu-rays are stacked on the right pane. Would it have killed Disney to use a case with a tray, so each disc is separate? I know that 3-disc cases with trays exist. I have several. I'm quite sure they could have made those same cases with black plastic, instead of semi-transparent blue.

7547958,1,B018FK66TU,"Should you see the latest Star Wars?  I won't tell you no....although, in my opinion.....no.  One of the biggest problems I have with this movie is the fanbois are so committed that they will not admit this is a truly terrible film.

Let's begin with black guy and white woman.  Race mixing isn't illegal, as it was for most of the last thousand years or so.  However, it is not common either.  As in, about as much goes on now that it is legal, as it did when it was illegal.  To encourage it is just as loathsome as to try and prevent it.  Certain elements of society think this is a fine way to destroy our way of life.  They are wrong (and racist), of course.  And the whole thing has gotten old.....so very, very old.  Which is why, the original plot of this movie outraged people the world over.  It got leaked and large numbers of people had a problem with it.  Not it, essentially but the heavy handed way its shoved down our throats.  Star Wars came VERY close to being boycotted.

Which raises problem number two.  The movie was obviously rewritten and refilmed at the last minute.  So much so that the plot doesn't even make any sense.

Problem number three.  Tapping Harrison Ford to carry this turd of a film.  The poor man broke every bone in his body recently in a terrible accident and is barely just recovered and OBVIOUSLY in tremendous pain all the way through the film.  Ford despises Star Wars considering the low point of his career.  Only a large wad of cash and killing off his character to permanently keep him out of movies like this, convinced him to do it.  And believe me...it shows.

Problem number four.  We have Darth Wussy instead of Darth Vader.

Problem five.  Other than Ford, all the previous cast are washed up hasbeens, never was.  Ford literally cannot resist ad libbing a comment about Fischer being too high on heroin to get her hair done correctly for the scene.  She barely snarls out a reply.  More like slurs out a reply.  Obviously high as a kite.  But that's better than Mark Hamil.  They did not even trust that guy with a single line.

Lastly....none of this matters because, oh, just for the hell of it, they killed all sentient life in the galaxy with their super death cannon, making all future movies pointless.

And none of the fanbois see any of this?  A decade from now, they will be laughing at this movie.",1473724800,6,2364,4.428904428904429

7547976,1,B018FK66TU,"I guess I shouldnt be surprised, but Disney Studios and J.J. Abrams took the last domain for boys and turned into another clich princess adventure.  Now Princess Leia is a general and leads a resistance army (equal pay?).  The new lead hero is now a female with a black male sidekick.  Female Storm Troopers!  Female amazon knight!  Walt Disneys head must be spinning in his cryogenic tank.  George Lucas must be pulling out whiskers.  Harrison Ford said Kill me off, please!!
  Even the casting was particularly bad.  The lead female and sidekick have British accents.  The wart-faced actor who plays the evil son is from the HBO series Girls in which he runs around naked trying to mate with the star pig.  And the actress who plays the huge chrome knight has had the same role in HBOs Game of Thrones for 6 seasons.  Typecast female??
  Today, the only entertainment left for boys is violent video games and porn.  Women are faking it with Magic Mike, so that leaves violent video games.

  I hope Disney doesnt turn Davy Crockett into Daisy Crockett.

  Hollywood did the same thing with Ghostbusters (female cast), and even the Hangover movies replacing them with drunken Bridesmaids and any other movie with Mellissa McCarthy.

  Today, a parent tells her son, You must give your Hot Wheels to your sister, and you cant touch her Barbie dolls.  Then tells her daughter, Your Barbies go in the trash because you must play with the Hot Wheels.  The only thing female thats supported by Hollywood today is the gender transition!",1473638400,,1531,4.766283524904215

7547981,1,B018FK66TU,"Disappointing that Disney and George Lucas couldn't choose a more interesting Star Wars universe story. This was basically, the exact same story line as Episode IV A New Hope. Another ""Death Star"", another ""Luke"" (but now is a girl). I think that Disney is disappointing the Star Wars fans trying to get the girl market. I have two daughters and they like Star Wars BECAUSE I LIKE IT not  because of Disney new  movies. In fact, my toddler dressed as Darth Vader last Halloween and we watch Episode IV, Episode V and Episode VI at least once a month, because they want to watch them.

Being a Star Wars universe fan I really am not buying this Blu Ray, the story is way too predictable, they eliminated one of Han Solo and Princess Leia's sons and they are not following the story line of  Star Wars ""official"" books.

Disney have done the same to the Marvel universe to some extend, at the very least the first Avengers movie was good, but then they started making changes as well.

Do not get me wrong, the special effects are great, but I have watch A New Hope close to 120 times now and , if you have done the same, you won't like The Force Awakens either. It seems like Disney/George Lucas did not learn anything from the horrible film ""The Phantom Menace"".

Disney did well on the office box of  theaters, but is loosing business on sales of Blu Rays, DVDs and even on action figures. My toddlers think that the new bad guy is Vader, and they do not quite understand why is that he is so lame!....

P.S. I and my two daughters are watching The Empire Strikes Back as I write this review. We do not mind Luke being white and Vader not being a girl at all!!!!

7548035,2,B018FK66TU,"If you are part of the group of people who live in the bubble where your idea of SW doesn't exist outside of and cannot be anything that isn't like the OT.
Then this is for you. For many of us who don't live in this bubble. This was the biggest disappointment of the last 25 years waiting for a Sequel film.

George really shouldn't have sold, but I can't blame him. You've got a vocal minority group of fans that complain that things weren't made the way they wanted.  Sewed from living in the bubble putting the OT up on a pedestal.
And look they finally got what they wanted.
A shallow rehash of the OT with 5% new material that hasn't been done elsewhere before. By the OT or otherwise.
Have you also noticed the words ""Episode VII"" have been plastered absolutely no where with any merchandise or even the movie itself? Because this is ultimately a REBOOT.

So TFA is so focused on a circle jerk to bashing the Prequels as much as possible, promising Practical Effects (When there is probably as much if not more CG than the PT [...]) and the OT in general.
That they forgot to do anything with the story,it's characters or put any kind of backstory or character motivations into the movie that doesn't amount to it simply straight up reusing the same plot points in a different order from A New Hope.

It's ridiculous when actors and the director have to comment to the media about why this person is like this or what this person thinks. Or you have to buy a companion book like Before The Awakening, The Visual Dictionary or Rey's Survival Guide to get information to make the world and plot make any logical sense.
That kind of information should be in the movie for petes sake. It's so insulting as a Star Wars fan. (ANH did enough to set up it's premise and explain basic things. TFA did not)

The movie ultimately feels like it was a 3 hour movie with any backstory or information about the characters or the state of the universe post-ROTJ was edited out into a 2 hour action movie with a weak, underdeveloped universe, story and set of characters to make the movie more palatable for brain dead people and OT fanboys. And an asinine deus ex machina that makes no sense to drive the main character forward.
Essentially like the entire first act of the movie was edited out. There is very little context for important things. One particular example is just thrown off as being ""A Story for another time"". That's a pretty important detail to just brush off.

Then there's Rey;
Yeah, maybe if the deus ex machina wasn't so absurd and outlandish in combination with essentially no exposition on Rey's life. People wouldn't be saying she's a Mary Sue. (I dont' personally think she is. Before The Awakening and Survival Guide provide great info)
No Jedi in the history of ever has just suddenly been given all amazing powers, having never wielded a Lightsaber before able to beat the guy who killed every other Jedi except the Master of them all, just like Vader.
This would be like if Luke in ANH, after having witnessed Ben being killed by Vader. Running over, and beating the tar out of Vader.

Not even Luke or Anakin had such an absurd mechanism to move the plot forward. No where even close.
(This brings up another point of TFA maintaining the status quo. There's no more Jedi, because a Skywalker with the power of the Dark Side killed them all!)

Likewise, the movie takes no time to explain anything about her life other than hey, she's a scavenger. It doesn't bother to explain that she's spent absurd amounts of time using a flight simulation program salvaged from a Y-Wing or having spent the better part of a year rebuilding a broken Freighter and trying to flying it to explain why she knows about ships and can pick up flying like it's nothing.
If they had included the information about Rey that SHOULD have been in the movie about her life growing up on Jakku alone from Before The Awakening ,there'd only be ONE reason to potentially call her a Mary Sue. And not the whole damn thing. (Again, not saying I think she is)
It had all the right things to execute it right but missed the mark by a mile.

Kylo Ren is just a warped mishmash of Anakin Skywalker and Jacen Solo with Ben Skywalker's name (Which on it's own makes no sense. Only Luke ever knew Obi-Wan and had known the man significantly as Ben. Leia knew him as Obi-Wan from her father. And Han briefly met the man and has never really made a mention of him ever.) to serve as the figurehead of what these people thought Anakin should've been all along.
A boring character inherently obsessed with the Dark Side. Ironically enough, Kylo Ren is more whiny than Anakin Skywalker was after he fell to the Dark Side.  Borderline crying and throwing temper tantrums and in general acting like an entitled spoiled brat. So I guess there's that, that's different about him and Anakin and Jacen.

The Journey to TFA books make TFA even worse because those are actually at least good at worst. And one of them is essentially required reading to save the movie from being a complete waste of time.
Which is a shame, because after reading all of these books before the movie. I was actually genuinely excited about TFA. I can even say I was hyped because the books were so good.

So TFA is incredibly vague and not only does a poor job of being 80% a remake of ANH, but fails to stand on it's own , detail anything about what happened after the Rebel Alliance's victory or the state of the universe and do anything new that isn't absurd or hasn't been stolen and changed from the old EU. It doesn't even tell you the damn name of half the Planets in the movie, one in particular when they find Luke. You know after all the hubbub and insanity of finding where he was, the name would be good to know. Jeez, even the OT told you the name of every Planet they visited.

It's all very poorly developed(Unless you spend the extra money to get the information that should have been present in the movie). All in the name of making a dumb action movie with even less background story, detail and exposition than A New Hope.
Because they(The film makers) live in this bubble where they fear that any kind of exposition that could be potentially hate trained into the ground because it's not like the OT.

And that's another thing, clearly this movie was designed purely to pander and elicit the broadest possible appeal and merchandising without stepping on the toes of that vocal minority.

So yeah, excuse those of us with half a brain and knowledge of even a little bit about SW being able to see something in a different light and not just glazing our eyes over with our brain turned off and a hard on from the amazing visuals and nostalgia.
""Film Critics"" are blinded by nostalgia with Rose Tinted Glasses strapped to their face. No one with half a brain and a bit of SW knowledge that doesn't have a hard on and put the OT on a pedestal wouldn't be rating this movie so perfectly.
You don't even have to be an adult to realize it's just essentially a rehash. My cousin's 8 year old son , who loves SW even randomly one day told me about how similar IV and VII are and that VII was basically IV but starting all over and he liked it better.

EVEN an 8 year old gets that it's just a rehash. (Regardless of liking it)

The fact that the movie is making tons of money means nothing, tons of supposedly terrible movies have made tons and tons of money. Like the PT that people supposedly hate.
Or Transformers, those movies make truckloads of money.
Really, Micheal Bay is to Transformers as Jar Jar Abrams is to Star Wars and Star Trek.
.

An extended edition of the movie(Alongside the theatrical cut in one pack) that puts another 30-60 minutes of footage and information that was edited out or should've been there could salvage some of it's biggest issues.
(Rey, The information and story present in Before The Awakening and Rey's Survival guide are enough to fix this. Aside from the incredibly poor choice for the namesake of the film without putting any actual plot behind it. There's no real context for Finn that makes his actions make sense)
But that's unlikely to happen.

Hopefully the next movie isn't as terrible and salvages this mess.(Thank the lord Abrams isn't writing or directing). And doesn't just rehash the OT AGAIN. Though I doubt it, they lied about Luke being in TFA, they made him into nothing more than a plot device and replacement proxy for Yoda in the OT.

There was this line about the movie hyped up to Rey. ""Who are you?"" Good luck getting that answer from TFA.

The plot points are very similar. Many I talk to feel that this makes it less than excellent, I think it makes it perfect.

As kids, we fell in love with the characters, the space battles, and the story from the originals. We're not kids anymore. We're now exquisite adults with high society tastes when it comes to film... Stop kidding yourself!

This is made to appeal to Star Wars fans big and, most importantly, small. Our kids are the ones who get to use this movie to fall in love with Star Wars just like we did all those years ago.

It was a safe play, and that's what we needed. I don't think I could have handled another Episode 1 experience, and our kids shouldn't have to either. The safe play allows it to reboot, and the change in scenery and changes in other details around the basic plot point means that they have some creativity to move the series forward with some new and exciting adventures that we haven't experienced yet.

This one is safe for young and old, there's love and loss, there's good and evil, there's serious lessons and light humor, oh, and don't forget spaceship battles,  lightsaber duels, and force usage.

This movie looks fairly awesome in the graphics department and it sounds great!
But it has more in common with action movies than sci-fi flicks. The problem lies in the amount of content that was put in. There are too many characters, too many scene changes and too many battles. It's wearing all of its jewelry at the same time.

7548132,1,B018FK66TU,"I knew this was gonna be bad from literally the first shot, which showed a sharply defined, perfectly triangular, planet-sized shadow of a star destroyer. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

1) The shadow would not look like a perfect triangle on a CURVED object. It would be curved and warped. Its like the image was drawn by a baby or a monkey. On a $250 million film. With storyboard artists and expert CGI people and designers of all kinds standing around. A planet sized triangular shadow with sharp straight edges. It looks retarded.

2) There wouldnt even BE a shadow. Even the biggest star destroyer is a microscopic dot next to a planet. Youd have to move the ship so far away from the planet to make the shadow that big, that at that distance, there would be no shadow because of diffraction.

This isn't science nerd nitpicking. Even to the untrained eye, it just looks retarded.

==== OK, on to more substantial criticism. ====

This film feels like a group of Star Wars fans were given an unlimited budget to recreate a greatest hits anthology of their favorite Star Wars moments with a new cast. In other words, its the most expensive fan fiction movie in history. The enthusiasm is certainly present but much of the story is nonsensical, major plot points and characters are thinly drawn or unexplained, and many of the emotional high points feel weirdly misplaced or fake.

The GOOD:
Location shooting, practical effects & stunts wherever possible, naturalistic/classical shooting & editing style, good acting, good pacing, exciting action. Everything looked & sounded great. Bye bye fake greenscreen look and CGI overload.

The CONFUSING:
1) Who is the First Order? Where did they come from? What do they want? Why do they seem like comedy sketch caricature of a Nazi rally? I almost expected a lisp.
2) Who is the Resistance? What happened to the Rebel Alliance taking over and ushering in a new republic? Did I miss a time travel, timeline-resetting, magic reset button plot point? I mean, this is JJ Abrams, right?
3) Who are those billions of people on those planets who all got incinerated? Nobody knows and nobody cares.

The STUPID:
1) Rey is an instant expert at literally everything. She can fix anything. She can fly the Millennium Falcon. She can use a lightsaber. She can Force-grab a lightsaber away from Kylo Ren. Speaking of Kylo Ren, Rey can go toe to toe with a Jedi-trained fighter whos wielded a saber all his life. All on the first attempt. No training, no practice. Because reasons. She can even perform a Jedi mind trick. This is particularly stupid and insulting because shes never even WITNESSED a Jedi mind trick. She doesnt even know its a thing. ARGH. A character that is amazing at literally Every Damn Thing is the most boring kind of character. Whats the point? Luke needed an entire trilogy, with lots of guidance & training, to learn these things.

2) Reys only discernible goal is to stay on Jakku and make sure shes home when someone returns. Mother? Father? Whole family? Dont remember. Dont care. But when she meets BB-8 (the droid) and Finn (the former stormtrooper, current AWOL deserter fugitive), she instantly chooses to leave everything behind and run away with them because reasons.

3) Finn makes no sense. Wasnt he trained from childhood to be a stormtrooper? Yet this was his first battle? How long is the training period? And he has a meltdown because oh-no-we-kill-people-me-no-like? How can he have an existential/moral/ethical crisis now after all the years of training/indoctrination/brainwashing/Heil-Mein-First-Order-ing? And how is his change of heart so complete that not only does he leave the First Order THAT DAY, but he breaks out their MOST VALUABLE PRISONER in the process? Because reasons. I got whiplash watching his 180.

4) Apparently Rey isn't the only instant expert on a lightsaber. Finn is able to expertly use one in a one-on-one duel with a stormtrooper. First time with a lightsaber. No training. No problem. Its not like it requires skill or training or anything. The once-revered, almost magical Jedi weapon is now a point-n-shoot kind of thing that any moron can use. Thanks for totally cheapening one of the best things about the original Star Wars, JJ Abrams!

SIDEBAR:
In the original Star Wars (A New Hope), Luke Skywalker is instantly a character we can relate to. We understand his current life and his future aspirations. Hes a young farm boy who longs to leave home and join The Academy, like many of his friends have already done, but hes tied down by family obligations. When his newly purchased droid R2D2 runs away, he goes searching for it, which leads to him meeting Obi Wan Kenobi, who tells him of his dead father and the Clone Wars. This makes him curious to learn more about his father, the past, and The Force. When Luke returns home, he finds his uncle & aunt murdered by stormtroopers. This tragedy does two things: 1) it frees him of his obligation to stay on Tatooine and 2) it gives him the specific motivation to go with Obi wan and to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi like my father. This is a perfect setup of character, plot, and theme. Everything ties together. And this thread will propel Luke through not just the rest of the film but the entire trilogy, as he fights the Empire, struggles to learn to use the Force, fight with a lightsaber, control his emotions, and gain wisdom & restraint, on the way to reconciling with and saving his father. The Force Awakens has nothing even approaching this level of storytelling craft.

The BORING:
1) Han Solos death. Whatever. His death means nothing to the main characters in the film. It only has meaning for Star Wars movie fans. Fan service fan fiction.
2) Maz Kanata. Did nothing. Fake mystery and non-answers: thats a good question for another time. Screw you, Maz. Screw you Abrams.
3) Assault on the cantina. Lots of flying ships, explosions, nice camerawork. Snore.
4) Poe Dameron. Who? Oh, that guy.

The EMO:
Kylo Ren is no SITH. Hes a little SH*T with a lightsaber. An annoying, petulant, whiny little f*ck trashing his hotel room because EmoRage.

The LAUGHABLE:
1) Kylo Rens lightsaber. Wins the Darwin Award for dumbest lightsaber design ever. One tiny slip and he cuts off his own hand. Or his whole head. Someone actually looked at this design and said ""yo that would make an awesome lightsaber duuuuuuuude!!""
2) Luke Skywalkers secret map split into two parts of his secret hiding place hidden inside a droid because he doesnt want to be found but just in case someone REALLY needs to find him map.

The PUNCHABLE:
1) During one of the battles, a stormtrooper drops his gun to go mano-a-mano with an electrified staff/sword against Finn instead of just shooting him. Because reasons. Dude, you're a soldier on an attack raid with clear objectives. Youre not in the octagon or in a bar brawl. I want to punch JJ Abrams.

The BOTTOM LINE:
If you completely shut off your brain and treat the movie like an amusement park ride and just go with it, its a perfectly serviceable 2-hour distraction. But if you think about it for even 2 minutes, you realize the whole thing is smoke and mirrors - its JJ Abrams flailing his arms around, distracting you with lots of busy-looking running running running around, emotional yelling (NOOOOOO!), dramatic posing for the camera, deep-sounding but meaningless dialogue, good special effects, and good-looking but nonsensical action. Its all spectacle, fan service, a bunch of feel-good moments and look-good images strung together for 2 hours.

Its not surprising that Damon Lindelof was co-screenwriter on this. Between him & JJ Abrams, they pulled the biggest con job in the form of LOST, with 6 seasons of hand-waving fake mystery. As for all the callbacks and homages to the original trilogy: if youve seen what Abrams did in Star Trek Into Darkness and its homage to the ending of Wrath of Khan, he basically did that for the entire 2 hours of Force Awakens. Which is why it feels like the most expensive fan fiction in history.",1472860800,6,8070,4.785201149425287

Though the plot was a bit familiar to Episode 4: A New Beginning, we still experienced some awesome new visuals and special effects that made us feel that kids again.

Im I'm giving it 5 stars to offset the 1 star BS reviews. Ill adjust the stars on how good the Blue Ray is when I watch it. The force awakens was amazing I saw it the day it came in IMAX and was worthy of being the 6th episode. Most true Star Wars Fans found the movie to be a great addition and a welcome entry after Lucus screwed up the series with episode 1-3. I did think #3 was strong enough to be considered a worthy entry, if the first two were made as well as it the 3rd the prequels probably wouldn't of left such a bad taste in your mouth..but then honestly the last movie was probably only strongest because you already sat through two crap movies with weak plots pushing you closer and closer to set up the final chapter and the dark side turn that everyone was waiting for since the first movie, or at least I was.",1472688000,12,1129,4.044642857142857

Review of the movie follows:
Pros: This was a fun movie reminiscent of Star Wars Episode IV providing entertaining action for fans of this classic sci fi franchise.  The characters were highly likeable.  The visual FX and cinematography were quite nice.  They did a nice job making tech of the future look about 20 years more futuristic from Return of the Jedi.

Cons: ...Come to think of it this movie was not just reminiscent of Episode IV it was a plagiarism of Episode IV.

The following is a list of the incredible ""parallels"" between Episode IV and Episode VII:
1 The mysterious, evil and dictatorial Galactic Empire rose from the ashes of the Old Republic with designs to rule the galaxy.
The mysterious, evil and dictatorial First Order rose from the ashes of the Galactic Empire with designs to rule the galaxy.

7548204,4,B018FK66TU,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Rated PG-13. Single-Disc. Running Time: 2 hours, 17 mins.
Directed by J.J. Abrams. Written by Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, Michael Aradt.

This is the movie we have waited 32 years to see.

George Lucas said he would never and did not want to make a sequel to Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983). We were disappointed in 1999, when Lucas decided to make a prequel trilogy based upon Darth Vader when he was a child and not bring back our original heroes.
  In 2013, George Lucas sold the Star Wars rights to Disney Pictures and finally after 30 years, we would see a new trilogy (2015-19) with our original actors in there original characters: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, R2-D2, C3PO and Chewbacca.

  The movie trailer for this won the Guinness World Records Award 2015 for most watched movie trailer on YouTube in 24 hours. 30.65 million views.

 This story of Star Wars: The Force Awakens is set 32 years after we left the land of Ewoks in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983). Everyone returns for this first movie of the new trilogy: Harrison Ford, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), R2-D2, Admiral Ackbar, Nien Numb, and oh yes, Mark Hamill as ""Luke Skywalker"" (but that is a surprise).
So glad they gave Harrison Ford many scenes in this movie. The new villain is ""Kylo Ren"". Not as majestic, but just as evil. For some reason he has the old mask of Darth Vader.
  The movie begins just like the ones in 1977-83. I'm not going to tell you any thing more about this movie. Many surprises and revelations. It was nice to be part of a movie theater audience that applauded at the beginning of the movie, the appearance of Harrison Ford as ""Han Solo"" and the surprise ending of the movie. It makes you want to say ""YES""!
  The next movie is not part of this trilogy, but begins before Star Wars (1977)...Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released December 16, 2016.
  The second movie of our new trilogy, Star Wars: The Last Rebel will be released December 15, 2017.

In the cast: Oscar Isaac, Max von Sydow, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Harrison Ford, Peter Mayhew, Joonas Suotamo, Anthony Daniels, Lupita Nyong'o (voice), Greg Grunberg, Warwick Davis, Ken Leung, Tim Rose, Mike Quinn, Simon Pegg, Daniel Craig.
Archive voice of Alec Guinness as ""Obi-wan Kenobi"".
Voice of Ewan McGregor as ""Obi-Kenobi"".
Voice of Frank Oz as ""Yoda"".
Voice of Erik Bauersfeld as ""Admiral Ackbar"".
Voice of Kipsang Rotich as ""Nien Numb"".

Music by John Williams.

One scene I did not like in the movie was Han Solo and Princess Leia seeing each other again - a scene that almost brought tears to my eyes - but they had that damn gold robot get in the way and say a stupid line.
Could have become a good classic scene - a tear jerker.
I never did like J.J. Abrams direction.

No but seriously, I enjoyed this 7th addition to the Star Wars series. I think the new actors are doing a good/great job, and have a lot of potential. There was a bunch of ""fan service"" moments in this film, which I didn't mind, and didn't feel were terribly detracting from the plot. A plot which teases the journey of this next Star Wars saga very well. It's the universe many of us have come to love, decades after we last saw it. There is plenty of old stories to retell, and new ones to explore.

7548250,5,B018FK66TU,"I never thought I'd live to see the day. Not the day I saw another Star Wars movie after the original trilogy. That came in 1999 with ""The Phantom Menace."" The day I'd see a *good* Star Wars movie? That I had given up hope for.

It's hard to talk about ""The Force Awakens"" without referencing the prequel trilogy. As I sat in the theater for the opening crawl, I felt a deep sense of fear and dread mixed with excitement and joy. I couldn't help flashing back to the moments when I saw the opening crawl of ""Phantom Menace,"" and I was so certain it would be a return to the greatness of Star Wars of old. And then the scrawl mentioned trade dispute, and I knew something was horribly wrong. By the time the third movie came around, I felt more resignation than excitement. I wanted to see the ending, but remembered the disappointment of the last two. And while ""Revenge of the Sith"" wasn't as bad as ""Phantom Menace,"" it still wasn't what I wanted from a Star Wars movie. I left feeling bitter, thinking it would be the last Star Wars movie, and we'd never have a return to what made the franchise great.

Now we have a new movie, and it seemed all we wanted was a movie that wouldn't screw it up. A few space fights, some lightsaber action, that's all we asked for. But ""Awakens"" delivers so much more.

""Awakens"" shocked me at first because it felt so modern. This is Star Wars if it was made today. The prequel trilogy slavishly mimicked the look and style of the original trilogy, as if they were works of unchanging art instead of the popcorn 70's movies they were. Each prequel started with a slow pan over a spaceship. Everyone was filmed flat on one side, reciting wooden dialogue with a serious but mumbling tone. Even the weird wipe transitions returned. They took the weaknesses of the old movies and made them ""the way Star Wars is supposed to be.""

Well, ""Force Awakens"" opens with a spaceship, but with shadows and depth, and backlit against a planet. It's a beautiful shot, and when the camera moves on, it came to life. The new movies are a world of intricate camera angles and transitions, wonderful visuals that echo the original movies, but feel even more real.

I should probably start talking about what the movie is about. Well, I'll try to avoid spoilers. The movie takes place thirty years after the original, where the happy ending from ""Return of the Jedi"" wasn't so happy after all. The Empire has been reborn into the First Order, fighting for control of the Galaxy. A stormtrooper nicknamed Finn goes rogue and joins a quest to track down Luke Skywalker, who's been lost for many years. In the process, he stumbles across a scavenger named Rey, and is forced to fight against the sinister Kylo Ren, who holds dark powers and secrets. But unlike the other Star Wars movies that could be summed up in a sentence, that description doesn't scratch the surface of the real story. Saying more would take away the fun.

After a while of watching this movie, I felt something I never expected. I thought the movie would be all about reuniting with the old characters and storylines from the original. It wasn't. It was about revitalizing Star Wars into a new world. I loved the new characters almost as much as the old. Maybe more. Finn and Rey were far more complex and interesting than anyone who'd ever appeared in a Star Wars movie. While it was great to see Han Solo and C3PO, I found myself way more invested in hotshot pilot Poe Dameron and quirky BB-8. It was a passing of the guard. I'm looking forward to their adventures in a way I never thought I would.

We get a deeper look at the Star Wars universe, and it feels more lived in. In the original Star Wars movies, everything was in the background for a reason, giving the illusion of life. Nothing felt like it existed before or after we saw it. In ""Awakens,"" it feels like a living world. The desert planet Jakku is a world of people struggling to survive, looting from dead spaceships for meager rations. Unlike Tatooine, where people did...what exactly? Farm moisture? Smuggle stuff? Shoot each other in bars?

But more than anything, ""Awakens"" is something Star Wars was never allowed to be: complex. When Lucas made a bad guy, he named him Darth Vader and dressed him all in black. Or he named him Darth Maul, and made him a literal devil with red skin and horns. Lucas never would have made a stormtrooper a hero, because the stormtroopers were Bad Guys. They were evil people to serve as cannon fodder for the real heroes. But not in ""Force Awakens."" In ""Force Awakens,"" we get shades of gray. Even Kylo Ren is a complex soul, wracked and tormented by his emotions and his past.

As for the actors, all good. John Boyega as Finn was funny and heroic, while also fearful and confused about his destiny. Daisy Ridley as Rey is almost impossibly beautiful. She spends most of the movie in rags with dirt smeared on her face, and she's still stunning. Yes, we have a new geek crush, and I await the polls pitting Rey up against Padme and Leia for hottest Star Wars babe. But I'm still voting for Leia. Oh, and she's also a great character. She doesn't sit around waiting for someone to rescue her; she rescues herself.

My only complaint is that there wasn't enough lightsaber fighting. But the movie was too busy telling an actual story, so I'll forgive it.

I could go on, but the bottom line is that ""The Force Awakens"" is a good movie. I only say it's the second best Star Wars movie because ""Empire Strikes Back"" holds the honor of the best, and I don't think anything can topple it. There's too much emotion and history for ""Empire."" Much like Muhammed Ali will always be the greatest boxer of all time, even if better technical fighters come along. But ""Awakens"" is truly the movie fans have been waiting for.",1472256000,4,5804,4.497153700189753

That is how great we thought that movie was and the next two didn't disappoint.

7548257,1,B018FK66TU,"Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I am a huge fan of the original three movies which I saw as a youngster, so I compare any new Star Wars movies to the three originals.  This review is about the movie itself, not about the Bluray release.  The movie itself has a tremendous amount of flaws.  When I heard J.J. Abrams was directing it, I knew it was going to disappoint, given how the trashed the Star Trek franchise with his reboots. i.e. Spock & Uhura relationship, which is a huge intrinsic character change in my opinion, and a bad one.

Here are some of the things I found annoying about the movie:
- A new Death Star, really?  Please give us a better plot next time.
- Kylo Ren is an annoying millennial brat for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever; He wears a mask just to be menacing?  Are you serious?
- All the bad guys in this movie are complete wimps.  Tell me if you think there is one equivalent to Darth Vader
- Luke Skywalker, the hero of the Rebellion has turned into a hermit and if it goes the way we expect, possibly the biggest jerk in the galaxy who left his child to fend for herself.  I expected more from Luke.  How can J.J. take a hero like Luke and put him in the gutters?
- Why does every have a one or two syllable names?
- The romance between Rey and Finn seems forced and fake.  It's not very convincing, compared to Leia and Han.
- Han and Leia marital problems?  Ugh.  Is this supposed to be interesting to us?

It's really sad how most of the new sci fi movies focus solely on the visual aspects and disregard the story.",1472256000,9,1548,4.1891891891891895

7548259,1,B018FK66TU,"Abrams pissed on George Lucas' saga and pieced together a series of action sequences without a hint of the imagination, heart, hope or bravado so abundant in the original trilogy. This movie is for the new kids. Any existing Star Wars fan will leave the movie a bit uneasy with the way our childhood heroes have all been disgraced, the Rebellion's great victory over the Empire in 1983 has been completely erased without explanation, and the new characters have immediate invincibility without having to trouble through any pesky trials or tests of character.

Han Solo, who spent three movies in the 70's and 80's developing from wise guy to stand-up hero, is now a deadbeat dad, who abandoned his wife and son to return to a life of crime, and ultimately dies one of the most meaningless deaths in movie history. Leia, the other Skywalker, who helped lead the Rebellion and was once destined to learn the ways of the Force like her brother before her, never bothered with that, and instead, took up drinking, and neglected her kid the same as Han did, causing him to become the galaxy's worst bad guy since Darth Vader. Luke, the naive farm boy who spent three long movies not only becoming a man, but assuming the role of a bona fide hero, and ultimately saving the galaxy by bringing about Darth Vader's defeat and redemption, not to mention the Emperor's destruction... well he's not even in the movie.  And Lando isn't even mentioned! Abrams/Kasdan could not possibly have treated these classic characters with more disrespect if they tried.

So what about that whole Battle of Endor episode in 1983? The Emperor, along with his henchman Darth Vader, and the Death Star were destroyed. The Rebellion finally won the day, peace was restored to the galaxy. There is not a single hint in this movie of how we got from there to here. What is the ""First Order?"" What is the ""Resistance?"" How did we get back to business as usual with stormtroopers and tie fighters running amuck?

To end in brief because it's been stated elsewhere repeatedly, yes, it's a problem that the new characters are immediately invincible. Are audiences that disinterested in character development anymore? Do we really just want to get straight to the explosions, like skipping to the last 60 seconds of a cheap porn?

If this movie represents what Star Wars is all about now, then I'm checking out. If audiences enjoy this, then I'm happy for you, it's all yours. The beautiful thing is that no matter what, nobody can ever take the original trilogy away from the rest of us.",1472256000,57,2554,4.743243243243243

To me Star Wars, Empire and Jedi will always be the first three chapters, because the prequels aren't worthy of existing. This movie deserves to be part of Star Wars. In 3D no less! I, for one, COULD wait to see it.

Now, on to the 3D release. I hate Disney as much as the next guy, BUT I took my protest in the OPPOSITE direction. As much as I wanted to own this movie, I DIDN'T purchase it because it WASN'T in 3D even though I was under the impression it would never be released as 3D. Refusing to pay for a product you know you don't really want is a far better protest than taking what they hand you, then complaining about it when when they finally offer what you wanted in the first place. As much as I love Deadpool, I'm refusing to buy it until it comes out in 3D release also. If it NEVER does, Disney, or whatever company, will have to go on WITHOUT ANY OF MY MONEY. If we could get people to stop buying whatever inferior product, that we really don't even WANT, the studios will in turn will have to stop ""double dipping"" and start offering us what we DO want. If not, you have one of three choices.

1) Wait to buy until the version YOU want is released. If they DON'T release what you want, DON'T BUY IT!!!

2) Buy what they offer first, even though you don't want it but don't mind being stuck with it.

OR, 3) let the company's get away with their double dipping, pay TWICE. It's YOUR decision so stop complaining about it!
