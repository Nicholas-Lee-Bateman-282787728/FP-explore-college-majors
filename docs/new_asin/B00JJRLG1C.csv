6363454,5,B00JJRLG1C,Great short story - can't wait to see the full movie.,1436313600,,53,3.909090909090909
6363455,4,B00JJRLG1C,Quite an interesting Holocaust story of a Jewish doctor who is needed to perform surgery on an SS officer's wounded son. Will he do as he is told? Will he let the son die? Find out for yourself!,1433203200,,194,4.131578947368421
6363486,2,B00JJRLG1C,This is not a film. Its a short documentary and we are charged for a full film rental. I found it misleading.,1492387200,2,109,4.0
6363487,3,B00JJRLG1C,"This isn't a movie, so shouldn't have been charged for it.  It is a short story.  Poorly acted, but an interesting dilemma.  People be aware; you are paying for a 30min. video of poor quality.",1489536000,,192,4.428571428571429
6363488,4,B00JJRLG1C,"Although short in length, it's message was moving, powerful and poignant.  The images will stay long after the movie is over,  especially the picture of Hilter, bloodied after the cloth was removed and the surgery was over.",1489017600,,223,5.0
6363489,1,B00JJRLG1C,"How in hell did this 4 stars. It doesn't deserve the $2.99 I paid to rent it...I would be reluctant to watch it if it were free. Actors are wooden, the camera work laughable, the dialogue is dreadful. With all the fake German accents, and improbable scenarios between the concentration camp inmate and Herr General, this movie meant to generate pathos, only made me laugh. Was this some undergraduate's end of term film project. The damn thing was only 30 minutes long. Amazon should make this film FREE...then I could stop watching after the first five minutes. There are great films about the Holocaust on Amazon..this ain't one of them",1483488000,5,638,4.8090909090909095

6363493,4,B00JJRLG1C,Probably an apocryphal tale but interesting and moving.  It also gave me a chance to scream at Hitler's portrait and re-curse the SS who managed the concentration camps.,1467763200,,169,5.035714285714286
6363494,4,B00JJRLG1C,just ok,1467590400,,7,3.0
6363495,3,B00JJRLG1C,"While the idea is interesting, the movie itself is not great. The accents are a bit off.... the nurse's wig is distracting, as is her ability to assess the seriousness of the situation given how little equipment she has. The general does not seem all that mean... the doctor was pretty ballsy which I don't think would have been appreciated in that era. Also, it would have been good to have had medical personnel available to make it more realistic. Still it could be something for 12 or 13 year olds learning about the Holocaust in a world history class to watch... it raises some questions... what would you do in that situation? Why did the doctor make the decisions he did?",1458086400,4,678,4.565573770491803

6363499,5,B00JJRLG1C,"Every Mother and Father should lovingly show their children this movie,
it will leave an interest of never again, a person, a race, a country

8651500,3,B00JJRLG1C,"---------SPOILERS---------------
Okay movie. I didn't like the all the medical inaccuracies though. Heart AND brain surgeon? I'm sorry but NO. It doesn't work like that. And he follows that up by saying he excels in heart, brain AND neurological surgery? ffs brain and neurological surgery are the same thing! The actual surgery was BS as well. What is the point of the surgeon and nurse wearing masks if NO ONE ELSE in the room is? EVERYONE needs to wear a mask if they're in the operating room. And the nurse just walks over to Hitlers portrait and covers it up thus breaking sterile precautions?! wtf? And for heavens sake you do not remove your mask and cap with bloody gloves. YOU DO NOT. This short made me cringe. Maybe it was different back then? I don't know. But I'm sure it wasn't THAT bad.",1509235200,,801,4.569444444444445
8651501,5,B00JJRLG1C,"The only great acting was the DR., but it was a wonderful short film.  I loved the shot of Hitlers portrait after it was unveiled. Tiny. little moments of humanity that we wish happened and the inhumanity we wish didn't.  Why are people so willing to believe such big lies? I thought we were too smart to be so manipulated. But I guess watching it happen country after country.",1506816000,,377,4.449275362318841
8651502,4,B00JJRLG1C,"Powerful little film enhanced by a good soundtrack and a superb performance from Peter Mark Richman. At the beginning this says it is based on a true story. On the one hand, I'd like to know that a Dr. Blumenthal really lived so. On the other hand, I hope a real Jewish doctor did not have to be put in that situation.",1506211200,,318,4.145161290322581

8651507,1,B00JJRLG1C,"Realistically, a Jewish prisoner of war in Germany would never have been so healthy looking, as this man was, compared to images we know are accurate; also, a prisoner would have been too emotionally beat down, or scared to be defiant or assertive, much less aggressive toward a German officer. The actor playing the Jewish doctor had to much physical strength and showed defiance and refusal to cooperate. The German wouldn't have tolerated that attitude. A real Jewish POW would absolutely not have shown any personality toward a German officer, other than to obey, and hope they didn't die. This is so unrealistic on so many levels.",1501027200,,635,4.94392523364486
8651508,1,B00JJRLG1C,"The story-line is pretty cool, but the cinematography is terrible. I got motion sick from the shaky camerawork. Also, I'm a medical professional so the technique was rather cringy.",1498521600,,180,5.241379310344827
