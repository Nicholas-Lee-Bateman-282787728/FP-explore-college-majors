7599161,5,B01ADWS7O0,"My Welsh grandpa came from a long line of miners.  Their children ran to their papas after their dark day underground. Miners held them in their arms & sang to clear their lungs. Before he died of the Black Lung, Grandpa told me about the mine wars.  All about Capital versus Labor & his hero, John L. Lewis, a Welshman.

This superb documentary focuses on West Virginia coal miners & their bloody struggle, second only to the Civil War.  Archival film footage & photographs capture life in the coal mines & their families who ""owed their life to the Company store.""  It testifies to our government's partnership with the Robber Barons to starve & murder the working Joes into submission to perpetual serfdom.  Pioneered by Mother Jones, coal miners fought their oppressors.  I suppose the good guys won, but doesn't that tiny percent of Wealth & Power continue to rule & oppress us?",1456704000,15,883,4.73202614379085

7599165,2,B01ADWS7O0,"This is a beautifully made film that, unfortunately, presents a shallow, outsiders view of the events surrounding and leading up to the Battle of Blair Mountain. The history is fairly accurate until about 1915 but then descends through egregious acts of omission to near fiction. While most of the academics interviewed were apparently well-intended, I am struck by the almost total absence of the local and coal voices who kept  this tale alive (Ross Ballard and Jeff Biggers come to mind) not to mention the living witnesses who are still with us. The portrayal of socialist organizers, such as Mother Jones and Keeney/Mooney as the prime organizers of the struggles demonstrates a lack of understanding of the context.  They were welcomed because they were helpful, while they were helpful,  not because  they were socialists. Mother Jones departure from the state after she lied to the miners is just one proof of that. Also misleading is the presentation of Baldwin-Felts thugs as mostly mean cops doing the bidding of the coal companies rather than as the murderous  thugs they were. Other egregious omissions include the one dimensional presentation of John L. Lewis and the portrayal of Keeney/Mooney as virtually the only leaders. Bill Blizzards role is marginalized  notwithstanding the considerable video record that illuminates the importance of his role. Even worse, the reduction of the treason trial to Keeney wriggled out of a conviction and the characterization of the Battle of Blair Mountain as a defeat ignores that these two events were the crucible out of which the next generation of UMW leaders emerged.
  There are so many authentic living voices that are ignored here that I cannot help but believe that the research behind this was done mostly in a library without interviewing the many people still with us who lived it as children and hold family stories of the events.  They apparently didn't even interview Cecil Roberts, president of the UMWA who is steeped in this history.
  Dont get me wrong, this movie should be watched because the story is so little known and played an important part in the development of the American labor movement, but  it is a mainstream history that is limited by shallow historical research. There is much in it to like: some of the interviews and especially the historical media.  HOWEVER, this movie is NOT a peoples history and as such only gives a narrow  glimpse of those Americans experience. A better job could have been done  especially given the obvious budget of this film. Should PBS revisit this topic I can only hope they cast a wider net for sources and context. For a far, far better media presentation of the struggles, I suggest looking at the History Channels series Hillbilly, episodes 5 and 6.

7599167,5,B01ADWS7O0,"When Pennsylvania union mine workers (UMW) abandoned West Virginia mine workers in Pain Creek and Cabin Creek, in 1980, Keeney with the help of Mother Jons joined forces with the abandoned West Virginia workers to defend their rights and become a union. When the war started, West Virginias some 3,000 miners helped to produce much needed coal during the war and after the war, they decided to unionize the rest of non-union miners in south West Virginia. This documentary is a proof that Americans are independent. It is not important what any one group of Americans may think if another group wants their way. If they do not get their way, and there are enough supporters to defend their cause, if no resolution, there will be another war regardless who is on which side just like the struggle in this case where it led to the largest armed insurrection since the Civil War that turned parts of West Virginia into a bloody war zone. Those Americans, who hate the NRA regardless of their political affiliation, may consider watching this documentary since this documentary is not only about UMW, it is about one group of American citizens defending themselves from the other group of Americans Castle Doctrine is active in West Virginia as well as open carry is permissible in West Virginia. It is amazing to see what those miners endured. This is a painful part of the American history but it certainly is a real American history. The idea that the coal miners life was worthless as far as the coal companies were concerned was the reason to believe that the only thing that was going to change anything was something more extreme. Something had to happen. The sad part of this story is that the ones who believed in change, Keeney and Mother Jons were both kicked out of their spot regardless of the reasoning. This seemed to be an informative and well done documentary but one thing that the film makers did not address and did not make any sense was that how those miners survived and feed their families when everything in those mining towns were supplied by their employer and those differences kept happening year after year... It is a worthy part of American history that deserves further study so I certainly will be checking into more documentaries only if there are any.",1453939200,6,2282,4.750629722921914

Coal Mining is, and always has been, a dangerous job. The working conditions miners encountered in order to scratch out a merger living for their families is unimaginable to the vast majority of us. Miners were frequently injured, or killed, while working. In addition to low wages, and dangerous working conditions, the miners and their families were further exploited by the Mine owners. High rents were charged for the substandard Company houses in which they lived. The inflated prices charged in the Company Stores left few alternatives to the miners, and their families, who had no alternative places in which to shop. The brave miners who even whispered a word of interest in unionization were subject to swift punishment. Many lost their jobs, their homes, and even their lives.",1469318400,6,1110,5.1722222222222225
