NO. And I really should have expected what I got, as they aren't going to pull back the curtain before they finish season 6....and maybe not ever, since that's what they get paid for.

However, there are couple recommendations I would make to improve this DVD:

1.  KILL THE INTERVIEWER.  She is absolutely horrible.  I want my interviewer to be as familiar with the show so they can ask the questions I want to hear - but I don't want them to be SOOOOO in love with the writers that she goes off on questions that she wants to learn.  For the love of god, take a course from the local community college to learn how to perform Interview 101.  And don't constantly say that you don't know what you are doing up there as an excuse for your lack of skill.  I hope for the final ""GOLD DISC"" set of DVDs for Lost Seasons 1-6 they'll redo this with someone who knows what they are doing and really give us a peak at how they make a show happen,.

2.  GET THE GUEST QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME.  Collect them when they are walking in and pick the best ones that collectively would create the story YOUR AUDIENCE would want to hear.  The interviewer was soooo off the cuff that the questions didn't really paint the best picture of what the DVD was trying to sell you on.

Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  But as a complete LOST addict too, I'm sure you'll read this and then click ""Add to Cart"" anyways.  I couldn't blame you.",1249171200,8,1559,4.244897959183674
