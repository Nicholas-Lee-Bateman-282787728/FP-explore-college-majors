8608643,2,B001DYCH08,"I saw the title The Complete Guide to the Full Swing. Tina simplified the grip,alignment,squaring the club head, and the beginning of the take-away.  Thats all she covered.  To me Full Swing should have included from the address,take-away,at the top and then the pre-impact,impact and finished. I guess the title should have been ""The First Half of the Swing "". I got this to help my grandaughter work on her down swing and it felt very short.  Totally deceived by the title.  I got this thru Championship Production and I am returning it. I wish there was a real Full Swing DVD out there for young girls from Ladies perspective. This is not it!",1306972800,2,645,4.631578947368421
