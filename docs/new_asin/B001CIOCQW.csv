8287935,2,B001CIOCQW,the quality and sound are okay. the artists are kind of mismatched and there is no flow to the entirety of it,1421798400,,109,4.0
8287936,3,B001CIOCQW,"Let me be clear, I LOVED each a every one of the performances. The quality of the video is what I can't stand. I have some of these unplugged and I know that they where recorded with a different standard. This, to me, was disappointing to the extent that I refuse to play them anymore.

I looks like it's a copy and not an original.

P.S. The same happened to the Soda Stereo Unplugged.",1417996800,,386,4.202702702702703
8287937,3,B001CIOCQW,not bad,1415750400,,7,3.0
8287938,5,B001CIOCQW,"Not all performers on this DVD are my favorites, but I must say the one performance of ""Tu Recuerdo"" by Ricky Martin and Chambao is worth buying the whole DVD...  also loved Shakira singing one of my all-time favorite songs ""Inevitable"" and Mana is, as always, wonderful.  Great to use in a Spanish-language class.",1390953600,,314,4.796296296296297
8287939,2,B001CIOCQW,"Es buen contenido, pero muuuy mal audio. Tengo un teatro en casa excelente, y el audio que sale del DVD es como si fuera grabado en VHS. Olvidate de tu equipo 5.1.",1285027200,4,163,4.125
8287940,5,B001CIOCQW,"Although is a short DVD, the music selected to be part of it, it's certainly a must have, now let's hope MTV some day would release each one of those artist on their on full MTV unplugged material on both CD and DVD/BluRay.",1281398400,,223,4.209302325581396
8287941,1,B001CIOCQW,"Good selection but terrible sound.  Only stereo sound (not Surround) and the quality of sound is very bad (like it's video).  If the sound of the full shows of Mtv Unplugged is like this...i wont't buy any.

In fact, i won't listend again this DVD.  I thought than the Mtv products were perfect.  I will drop it to the trash",1276560000,,324,4.333333333333333
