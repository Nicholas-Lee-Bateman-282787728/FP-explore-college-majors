3713095,5,B0001LQJQW,"NFL films does their usual fine work in sharing this series of engrossing tales which are sometimes overlooked by modern football audiences.

3713102,1,B0001LQJQW,"Absolutely horrible movie from the writing to the directing to the acting. Many mistakes in this period piece (I'm quite sure that women in medieval times didn't wear shiny red lipgloss). This movie was so bad, I only watched the first half, which was a complete waste of time. Perhaps a 10-year-old might overlook the many flaws, but I'm not so sure.",1505692800,,351,4.67741935483871

3713107,4,B0001LQJQW,"Time travel movies generally make little sense. This one is no exception. But it is still fun to watch Paul Walker play the earnest young hero again. However, the book was much better, where Walker's character was also an archaeologist and the female lead's part was a little less trite.",1500508800,,287,4.76
3713108,5,B0001LQJQW,Great movie,1500249600,,11,5.0
3713109,4,B0001LQJQW,"Started watching because of Gerald Butler... and liking the idea of time travel to 100 yrs war period (not enough movies in this costume period).  The basic story is interesting, some fleeting reference to how what u do in the past effects the future without getting into the details of time paradox.  Great job with the rough costumes of the past, with generally grungy cast.  Not very gory so the rating of PG13 makes it appropriate for middle school & up.  Must pay attention to opening scene to understand why what happens later & its significance.  Easily sucked my family in when they didn't plan to join me watching it... they passed by the living room, saw something that interested them (the flashes between modern & medieval times or the fight scenes) sat down, didn't leave until it ended.  Then they watched the beginning scenes they had missed!  It's too bad this movie did not do well in box office, my family really enjoyed it!",1498176000,,942,4.672727272727273

3713117,5,B0001LQJQW,"Timeline is a great story about archeologists going back to France in the 13th century, during the 100 years war.

Not a single negative in my opinion - I strongly recommend this movie to fans of drama, history, and time travel.  And the ending makes the movie great.",1489881600,,387,4.848484848484849

3713128,4,B0001LQJQW,The movie was good! Good cast and acting! I gave 4 stars because the movie left out so many details that were in the book. I know every movie does that somewhat but it would've been better if a little more had been explained... Overall I'm glad I watched though!,1481068800,,262,4.26

3713131,5,B0001LQJQW,"I have always loved this movie. I watched it long before I read the book (which is excellent) and it was good to have the mental pictures when I was reading. I'm not one to focus on the difference between the writing and film, I expected them, so no complaints from me.
The characters were entertaining, and I loved the bit of romantic attraction between Lady Claire and Andre, and the hopeful interest of Chris towards Kate, and loved how it all worked out for them.  I will watch this again (and again), as well as re-read the book.",1478649600,,534,4.393939393939394

3713136,3,B0001LQJQW,A very so so movie. Too bad Amazon doesn't allow 1/2 stars or it'd get a 2 1/2. The book was good but not great but the book was still much better than the movie. Just didn't translate well into a movie.,1474502400,,203,3.857142857142857

3713143,3,B0001LQJQW,"I loved the book, but the movie didn't do it justice. A great shame because there were some well cast actors in this film. I could have watched Gerard Butler watching paint dry (with his shirt off) and still given the movie at least 3 stars, LOL! Sorry, but had to be honest. The Director is to blame here. It's the director's vision that ends up in the can, and in this case, it was pretty blurry. A great shame. Maybe someone will try again someday and do a much better job. Just don't forget to cast Gerard Butler again. Seriously.",1469491200,,534,4.297029702970297

3713149,1,B0001LQJQW,"Not good- read the book! The book was a fun, fast paced adventure. The movie was very poorly written and directed. They wasted a great story and a great cast of actors (most of them) on a lousy, low budget mess of a movie.",1467763200,,222,4.068181818181818

3713151,5,B0001LQJQW,This was a good book and is a good movie.  Written by Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park).,1465776000,,87,4.4375
3713152,3,B0001LQJQW,"I so love this book, and I so want to like this movie more. I watch it every so often, simply because I like the actors. The acting could have been better, or maybe it's the direction. Everything about the acting seems rushed, as if they didn't have enough time to rehearse or do enough takes or something.

The movie leaves the plot of the book from the start, changing the entire tone of the movie. That would be fine, except it's touted as based on the book, and the book has ""a major motion picture"" listed on the cover. It's kind of a bait and switch.

They also took all the important women out of the story: the doctor in Gallup is man; Kramer is a man; Gomez is a man. Kate; Kate was a strong woman; Francis O'Connor gives a game try, but doesn't even come close. She's giddy by turns, unbelievable in other scenes, bossy, huffy, immature.

They did get Doniger dead to rights. He's just as much of a jerk in the movie as in the book. And the actor plays it perfectly.

They screw up language and archaeological methods and dress and almost everything else. Maybe it's time for a remake. Gerard Butler is of an age to play the professor; it's a thought.

It is worth watching Gerard Butler though with his shirt off, and as the romantic hero, so I'll keep watching it again. Billy Connolly is always a treasure, and then there's Paul Walker. A very young Paul Walker. I can't work up much enthusiasm for Francis O'Conner, who seems totally out of place as Kate.",1464739200,,1469,4.346715328467154

3713159,4,B0001LQJQW,"Good movie! Has the feel of an ""Epic"" to it, due to the battle sequences and the time period it is set in. Strong performances by the late Paul Walker, and a surprising performance by Gerard Butler. Saw it twice and knew I had to own this movie!

I am always surprised Gerard Butler doesn't get higher billing and I actually did not realize Paul Walker was in it until I bought it as Billy Connolly always gets top billing with my search component from my cable company.

If you've read the book it might be worth 2 hours of your time to watch the story play out on screen. If you haven't read the book I really don't think you'd have a clue what was going on. I read the book and had a tough time following the film.

The problem with the movie is that they cut out a lot of the set up of the story and forced the viewer to figure out who the characters were and what was going on between scenes. It also takes a 36 hour adventure in the book and makes it a 6 hour adventure in the movie for no real reason. I understand the movie has to fit a lot into 2 hours, but by making the elapsed time in the story 6 hours the character development makes no sense. There isn't enough time for Marek and Lady Clair to fall in love, or for anything else to develop, so those relationships feel forced. All teh movie had to do was show the same scenes but say it was all taking 6 times longer and it would have been much better.

Even with the all star cast this one just missed.",1431475200,,1178,4.004255319148936

3713198,3,B0001LQJQW,"Not a great film by any means.  The book version was 800 times much better & very enjoyable.  I cannot believe the only two movies of Crichton's they got right in my opinion was his masterpiece ""Jurassic Park"" & ""Rising Sun"".  ""Congo"" the movie was fairly entertaining, but not as good as the book either.

  This is an action adventure sci fi yarn about a high tech company that accidentally find's a space time wormhole, sending their employees back into the past of Medieval France.  A war between England & France ensues, and the heroes find themselves caught in the middle of it.  The young guy's father, the Professor of history, was lost in the time warp where a team goes back dressed as Medieval Europeans to rescue him.

 The Meric character was portrayed okay by ""300"" star Gerard Butler, the expert on European warfare and hand to hand combat.  The female character is portrayed in my view awfully by an uninteresting actress.  The actor from ""Band of Brothers"" has a cameo role as a hired tough guy, but he doesn't really do anything for this film either.

 The tone was really nothing like the book's tone, and the mystery, action, and Medieval European flare just did not move me at all compared to what the book described in the late Dr. Crichton's words.

 Crichton wrote a fine sci fi adventure tale that in total explained mankind, through the many years and ages, really hasn't changed much from the time of dark ages to today.  We like to believe human beings are more civilized and have evolved, but as recent history points out the world really hasn't evolved much at all, the only thing that is always changed is the technology used to inflict harm upon each other.

3713263,3,B0001LQJQW,"Can you believe it took me ten years just to sit down and watch this movie? Yep! With the tragic passing of Paul Walker, I decided to give his films a second glance and I was glad I did. While not an award winning film by any means, this sci-fi actioner does have its moments. Unlike previous reviewers, I have not read the book. Don't need to, the movie is fine on its own without all the technical gibber jabber to cloud my viewing experience. As a history buff, I found the premise exciting, but Michael Sheen chewing the scenery put a damper on that. The guy is only on screen for a few scenes, but he had me wanting to hurl a chair at him for what he did to poor Francois. But the actor is a chameleon and it shows.

  As for the other actors, Gerard Butler seems to have the most screen time and I don't know why. It' s an ensemble cast, yet the second half of the movie is devoted to him playing hero to some French damsel in distress. Yawn. There's not enough of Paul Walker in this and it's a shame. He plays the professor's son who has a crush on one of the assistants and that's all he does. He's wasted in the film and I don't think any of the other actors were given much to do except run around and act confused. It' s a real shame, because they can act. But you can take the film for what it is: a small sci-fi action/adventure with a promising premise of time travel and evil corporations and all that. The movie has way too many plot holes, such as the fact that time travel may scramble your DNA to the point where one more trip may mix up things permanently. OUCH!! Anyhoo, Paul Walker does an adequate job with what he was given, but it's really Butler's show and the film seemed better suited as an offering on the SYFY channel. Promising premise that gets lost in translation. Good to see the fine young man Paul was and nothing more. Three stars because it does have a few moments involving a nasty villain who should have gotten his comeuppance much sooner.",1391126400,,1981,4.207894736842105

There is a lot of drama. About a half dozen people risk their lives to go back in time into an area where a war is being waged and a castle will be destroyed.

I will say that Paul Walker is a terrible actor, and brings the movie down a bit. THE rest of the actors do a pretty good job, a group of archeology students are sent back in time. To search for paul walker's character's father, the movie doesn't try to be anything other than what it is.

3713301,3,B0001LQJQW,"If you can just put the novel out of your mind when watching this film, it's actually pretty enjoyable once the characters are transported back to medieval France.  But the problem is that all of Crichton's wonderful lead-up to that point in the book is just rushed and way too truncated in the film, and utterly squanders the value of what Crichton presented in his book as a teachable and debatable lesson in quantum mechanics and alternate timelines.  None of the technological or character set-up was apparently scripted (or filmed) for this movie.

As a result, what we're left with is a slightly more intellectual than usual time-travel movie that is done very well once the characters are actually transported to the past.  But that's not the unique value of a Michael Crichton story.  The unique value of a Michael Crichton story lies in all the moments of didactic teaching exchange between characters who have a unique knowledge of something, and the characters they engage in explaining and clarifying it to.  Yet, over and over again, so many of the Hollywood shallowists who take up the task of making Crichton's stories into films, are either completely oblivious of this fact, or are too smugly dismissive of its value.  As a result, you end up with just more cookie-cutter action films, but with the name ""Michael Crichton"" tacked onto them.

The casting is actually very good for this film, but I think the fault lies with the director, or with whoever compelled him to make something significantly less than a Michael Crichton story, or with whichever pivotal person who presumed they knew what a Michael Crichton story is, but really didn't.  For example, Gerard Butler is great in this film for what he was directed to be, but the problem is that he wasn't stretched, by the director, into the typical central Michael Crichton character, who is a bit more of an academic-minded ""Aspie"" (look it up) with an overtendency to deliver didactic monologues.  I too often miss that in adaptations of Crichton films.

Don't get me wrong -- Timeline is done very well, for what it is.  But the problem is that what it should have been, is a Michael Crichton story, with a good deal more cerebralized preaching and topical lecturing as integral parts of the storyline.",1371340800,,2278,4.842783505154639

Timeline is probably my favorite Crichton novel, and this movie did change some things but IMO nothing crucial.  Every movie adaptation has to take some shortcuts somewhere.

The acting was marginal, at best. The photography wasn't bad, however. The story was, well, unbelievable. Let's break it into two parts. First involved the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo of time travel from the present back 600 years via someone's idea of a hokey time-travel machine. Just relax and throw away all your scientific background. Of course, they were having problems with the machine and one problem was they lost the good professor on the last trip back and now had to go on a rescue mission. Yaawwwnnnn!

Well, they managed to get back 600 years only on the day of a major battle in the French-English 100-year war. Bad timing. Now we went into the second part of the movie and that was at a castle in Northern France which was about to engage in battle. Here, the costuming and set was actually rather good. The action was brisk and violent. There were a lot of brutal killings, but such killing was with clubs, swords and arrows. Remember, this took place 600 years ago. The main battle scene was actually quite interesting, particularly with the use of long-range ballistics (catapults), the high-tech weapon of the day. The hand to hand fighting was brutal and rather well done. In all this part, the time-travel crew faced a deadline in having to get back, if you believe in that drivel about time travel, and the reliability of their machine was in question because of a previous misuse. Yaawwwnnnn! Let's face it. The movie was a failure with a few well-done parts.

3713337,3,B0001LQJQW,"An appealing enough story, but a little too chaotic for my tastes, and too involved with warfare.

Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) is an archeologist excavating the ruins of a castle that was destroyed during the hundred years war, in April of 1357. His son Chris (Paul Walker) haunts the site mostly because his father's assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor) is there, and he is smitten. He acknowledges that he does not care much for history.

Nearby, Robert Doniger (David Thewlis aka Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter series) runs a scientific laboratory that accidentally opened a worm-hole in space-time. They want to learn as much as they can about what's on the other end of the worm-hole, and give Professor Johnston a chance to go back to the time of the battle that destroyed the castle in order to find out. When he does not come back after two days, Kate, Chris, and several of Professor Johnston's other students go to the lab and demand answers.

The lab is ready for them; they are to go back and rescue the professor. Most of the action therefore takes place in 1357 in the middle of a historic battle.

Most stories about time travel make large efforts to avoid time paradoxes, but when a lens from the Professor's glasses and a note in his handwriting pleading for help are found in a chest which has been buried for some 600 years, we already know paradoxes are going to be involved. I tried very hard to keep track of them, but gave up when I realized that they were indeed going to change the course of history, and since they did indeed exist in the 20th century (21st?), apparently the changes were not of the sort to destroy us all.

It's entertaining, but would be a great deal more so if I had paid attention in history and/or followed the things my Society for Creative Anachronisms friends told me about the weapons and warfare of the period. After they got back to the past, I just sort of sat back and let the story unfold.",1336867200,,1961,4.559659090909091

I am biased because I read the book a few weeks ago. I'm sure I would have liked it more if I hadn't read the book. The Punk & I watched it and the whole time he told me to hush.  Apparently, I was saying, ""That didn't happen in the book"" too much.
The book gets into the quantum mechanics of probable time travel, while the movie skipped over it. In the book, the characters are well written. You don't have to know a lot about them to like them.  They are very empty in the movie because all they do is run away from soldiers.  My biggest peeve was that three of Micheal Crichton's characters were female in the book and the screenwriter had them grow penises for the movie.  The only character to keep true to the book is Marek (Gerard Butler).
Even the setting of the war was changed!  All the espionage with Lady Claire is gone.  Oh wait, she's still Lady Claire, only completely different. In the book she is a conniving widow. In the movie she is an innocent spy and romantic interest for Marek.

3713349,5,B0001LQJQW,"I read the book, played the game, and last night, I finally watched the movie. Previously, I hesitated to get it because of all these critical reviews, but when the opportunity to rent it arose, my curiosity won out. To my surprise, it was not nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be. I've seen a lot of cheap, badly-scripted films before, and I wouldn't say this is one of them. I'm sure there are ways they could have done better - I mean, what movie wouldn't benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop the story further? - but considering what they had to work with, I think they did very well. Part of the attraction for me is seeing familiar faces, like Paul Walker, Billy Connolly, and David Thewlis, though he seems an odd choice to cast as the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed head of ITC. Chris (Paul Walker) is supposed to be the main character of the story, but in both the book and the movie it is Andre Marek that steals the scenes. Played by Gerard Butler, he is sure to charm viewers with his chivalric deeds and lilting Scottish accent.

In the book, the only takeaway point seemed to be that times were violent, contrasting this with the romantic view we have of the medieval ages today. The movie skillfully balances both the romance and the fighting, taking time to note the characters' horror at having to kill people while also delicately develop the romance. I also liked that Chris, totally disinterested in history at the beginning, discovers how real and how pertinent it really is for all of us by the end of the movie. Very nicely handled.

The music was adequate, though not as brilliant as the pc game soundtrack by Bill Brown I have to say. This being a ClearPlay review, I'll note that the profanity is filtered out (there's a lot of it), in addition to clipping out a piece or two of violence. The rest is left in. Considering that they could have easily made this an R-rated film, and didn't, there's nothing to complain about there. The battle at the end with all the blazing fireballs was quite impressive. I now own this movie and while it may not appeal to everyone, I think fans of the book or of time travel or of the medieval ages ought to give this movie a fair chance.",1316131200,,2209,4.438423645320197

What a mess. It's an interesting story/concept, but one that is so poorly executed. It has a ""made in the 1980's"" feel to it--its production values are far below those typically found in movies from its time (2003). Stereotypical action flick characters, dramatic orchestral music for less-than-dramatic scenes (involving just a few dozen soldiers, rather than hundreds or thousands), cheesy dialogue. It feels like it was slapped together in a hurry.

3713357,5,B0001LQJQW,"Imagine something like a ""Time Machine"" (the book) twist on LotR...you will have Timeline.

(mild spoilers)

The movie focuses on a modern-day set of archeologists who are sent back in time to Castlegaurd, France, during the Hundred Year War, to find a friend who was also sent back. Along the way, they meet characters, form relationships, and discover secrets that will, ultimately, change the course of history. Or, will they?

The synopsis is simple enough, but the story is far more complex and entertaining than a simple ""summing up"" can indicate. The cast is great; Gerard Butler's history-buff archeologist, Marek, is one of his best performances IMHO. British actress Anna Friel's French Lady Claire is also superb. The film moves quickly, keeping your interest, but not too quickly to sacrifice anything.

Now, I mentioned that this was something like a time-travel twist on LotR; let me further refine that to say a time travel twist on the human, pre-defeat of Sauron world of LotR. In other words, the world is not the shiny white walls and delicate beauty of Rivendell, nor even the polished majesty of Gondor after Aragorn's return; this is more like the battle for Helm's Deep -- dark, gritty and not at all a perfect, idealized world...more like a 14th century, war-torn area would be.

Finally, let me say this...people have complained that this was not as good as the book. It was not the *same* as the book, but I think far better. These characters are actually likable, and you have no compunction cheering for them. There is more to compel you to ""their side"" than the fact that they are the protagonists of the story. That said, most people I know who loved the book didn't like this, at least as a representation of the book. So, if you love the book and want to try this film, perhaps think of it as a different story. :)

The ""science"" in it leaves a lot to be desired. How did they do those quick field C-14 readings? It is a love story, but not a great love story as there is virtually no character development. It is history as there was a 100 years war, but the facts in this story are manufactured. This was year 20 of the 100 Years War and even if the English did win this battle, it really would not have altered history as England simply didn't have a big enough army to hold and occupy France, even if no one lived there. They couldn't have won that war...even in a 100 years. Yes, it is also an action flick, but don't expect a lot of it.

A corporation accidentally discovers a wormhole and time travel. The wormhole always leads to the same place in time, Castleguard in France, 1357. They transport back an archaeologist who gets stuck back there. They then send back a party to rescue him.

Those that aren't spend most of thier time climbing on buildings, and smashing up walls. One decides to rescue a French girl (Anna Friel with a very bad accent), from the nasty English who kill the French for sport (after having ran out of deer.)

While their initial desire is only to escape, as the hostilities progress they find themselves becoming involved in the conflict, choosing sides and ultimately playing an important role in determining the eventual outcome.

Critique: The '03 release `Timeline' is an overall entertaining time travel/romance tale that relies on the audience interest in the characters rather than special effects to hold the viewers interest. Along with the time travel scenario there are also two love stories unfolding in this film, one between the professors son Chris (Paul Walker) and archeology student Kate (Frances O'Connor), the other between fellow time traveler Andre (Gerard Butler) and 14th century beauty Lady Claire (Anna Friel). It was the relationship and interplay between Butler and Friel that made the film for me. Without those two this film would've received -3 Stars- at best.

We learn that the younger  Johnston is there not only to visit his father, but also to woo his father's pretty assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor)--an undertaking his father discourages because he knows from personal experience that relationships between people of dissimilar interests tend to fail.
 What does hold Chris' interest is his friendship with the other Scottish academic, Andre Mareck (charismatically played by Gerard Butler).
 When Professor Johnston mysteriously disappears, physicist Steven Kramer (Matt Craven) finds evidence that the Professor has traveled back in time and is trapped there, Chris, Kate, Andre, Steven, and Francois Dontalle (Rossif Sutherland), travel to the International Technical Center in New Mexico, where Chris, Kate,Andre, Frank, Francois, and two of Frank's fellow ex-marines (Patrick Sabongui, and Mike Chute), step on the lab's time machine after being adequately prepped for their journey, and courtesy of a physicist with rather dubious intentions named Robert Doniger (David Thewlis)who collaborated with Professor Johnston on various projects, are transported back to 1357 Castlegard.
  Complications in bringing the time travelers home stem from their being plunked into the middle of the Hundred Years' War on one end, and because of the explosion of a modern weapon that should not have gone back in time causing damage to the machine on the other. The conflicts of interest between Doniger and Kramer add to the problems as well.
 Two of the time travelers are killed within minutes of their arrival; another is lost during an encounter with the arrogant Lord Oliver(Michael Sheen).
 Soon, they find the Professor, but Mareck's encounter with Lady Clare (Anna Friel), the sister of French General Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson), changes both his destiny and hers.
  Another encounter with Sir William De Kere(Marton Csokas), who  is intriguingly familiar with the group's history, makes the journey even more perilous.
 Chris is able to assist Kate when she uses her archeological skills to turn the tide of events on the night of the siege of Castlegard. For him, history has truly come alive, and happily, he is able to share this with the woman he loves.
 However this film may be panned by others, I found it to be an intriguing bit of sci-fi which evokes questions about loyalty, how far we would go on behalf of those we care about, and what we would do to change the bleakest situations in our favor.",1206835200,,3373,5.176470588235294

3713385,3,B0001LQJQW,"A few months before it's release, I had the opportunity to attend a screening of this film while in L.A. The trouble with advanced screenings, you're never sure if you're seeing a final cut, a rough cut, or something which will be retooled based on audience response. Overall, my impression was that it was closer to a final cut than anything else.

The plot finds several 21st century archeologists in 15th century France, on a mission to rescue their mentor. The Professor was sent back and left for dead by the Bill Gates-like mogul who stumbled upon the time travel technology.

Director Richard Donner seems set on a low-tech approach to the special effects. A refreshing change in these days of everything being CGI. While a bit predictable at points, the story flows fairly well and makes for a fun time at the movies.

I would have been better off, however, watching the nine o'clock  news on TV last Sunday. Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was a dud. I stuck it out to the bitter end. I felt that the highlight was the siege effects in the last half an hour despite the French knight toting a shield bearing the arms of Canada's Quebec La Belle Province, founded many centuries later!  The acting was appalling and very hammy. Did any of these ""actors""  actually graduate from Acting Academy? I have seen better drama and less emoting in junior school stage productions. There is also the problem of a very thin story line. Time travellers get stuck in a wormhole, others sent to extract them  and nearly get stuck too about sums it up. Plenty of  historical flaws (1357 was one year after the  battle of Poitiers in which the French king and many  of his  nobles were captured and detained in London until the Treaty of Bretigny of  1360. It was in the middle of  a very  bad period for France and the English  certainly didn't have their  backs to the  wall then ).

3713399,2,B0001LQJQW,"This is actually 2 reviews blended as one; the first, the movie as a standalone film (disregarding the book), and the second, as an adaptation of the book.

THE MOVIE:
The movie was not very good. It moves quickly and is filled with action but suddenly dies half way through and grinds to a slow finish. They don't really take time to explain much, rather they press forward with the story and unsuccessfully try to allow the characters to explain important points as the film runs it's course.

The story is creative and could be exciting. Archaeologists go back in time to the place they had been excavating. The man who is sponsoring the archaeological dig is a bad guy, someone seeking to make money off of the scientific find of the ages, time travel, even if it costs a few lives.
The acting is OK, the direction is OK, the editing OK, the screenplay is horrible, and the costumes, landscapes, sets and period pieces are somewhat authentic although stylistic and cliche.  The battle scenes are poorly choreographed and not exciting.  The only thing of note that was accurate would be the siege engines.  That was done well.

All-in-all, the movie is poor. It is an OK escape, a film that may be worth watching but which does little to add to the genre of action/adventure films. A below average outing.

THE MOVIE AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK:
This is where the movie really falls flat.

If you read the book, don't expect much from the movie. Everything is changed. Characters, their motivations and fears, reasoning and abilities, strengths and weaknesses, relationships and interactions with each other, are all changed from the minute the film begins. A few good characters are completely dropped and several others are significantly changed from the book. The best character from the book, Andre Marek (played by Gerard Butler) is uninteresting at best.

The plot, the scientific explanations of time travel (which the movie just explains was an accident), the historical figures, the confrontations and protagonists, are all different and lack the depth and richness they possessed in the book.  This was a pathetic attempt at adapting a book to film.

The book, as usually is the case, was much better than the movie. I can accept that. The basic premise of the book is carried over; that is to say that ""based upon the novel by Michael Crichton"" is an accurate while also misleading description.  This movie just does not maintain any similarity to the book aside from the basic premise. It was very disappointing.

I truly enjoyed the book and felt that it could have been better adapted. I don't know if Crichton (the writer of the book) was involved in the movie, but if this were an adaption of a book that I had written, I would be very unhappy with the hack job that Hollywood did on a novel that was well researched, well written and thick with character development, historical accuracy and suspense.

MY RATING:
So, to sum up; if you are looking for an adventure, set in medieval times, this may suffice as mindless entertainment.  As a standalone film, disregarding the book, the movie is a 2 or 3 out of 5, if I am generous

As an adaptation of the book, I would give this a 1 out of 5, very poorly done and extremely disappointing compared to a very good book.

So, I arrive at an average rating of 2. Had I not read the book, I may have rated the film a 3, but that is a bit generous because the movie just doesn't hold up as an entertaining adventure.  Sorry.",1177804800,,3487,4.633116883116883

and Lady Claire.  He solely seemed to grasp the essence of the role and

became the part of Andre Marek.  The rest of the cast never seemed to get it.

3713402,3,B0001LQJQW,"I was glad to see that most reviewers realized that director Richard Donner (16 Blocks, Lethal Weapon, Superman) was to blame for turning a perfectly good Michael Crichton story into an episode of Time Tunnel. I knew something was wrong when Gerard Butler (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie) - a talented actor - who plays archeologist Andre Marek, was reminding me of Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon. Like so many actors before him, he was momentarily seduced by the Richard Donner ""let's forget the script and just ad lib"" school of acting. I think he finally does overcome the Donner side of the Force, and turns in a good performance in the second half of the film. But there's a lot the audience has to endure until we get to that point.

Like 14th Century English soldiers being understood by 21st Century English-speaking scientists, and vice versa! That's seven centuries! (We can barely understand our own parents.) So the believability factor is quite low in this pseudo sci-fi thriller. It would have made much better sense to make this a fantasy film, left out all the fake scientific stuff, and gone straight to the battle and love story, which are the best parts anyway. That said, there are some problems with the historical side of the story as well. Even with all the extra features praising their own efforts at research and authenticity, I felt like I was watching a modern day Renaissance Festival, rather than real people living in a real era.

But the battle at the end is exciting; and Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Me Without You) as Lady Claire and Gerard Butler as Marek do hold our attention as they woo each other, as does Paul Walker (The Fast And The Furious, 8 Below) as Chris Johnston, the son of the scientist they've all gone back in time to rescue. The rest of the cast is just okay. Even though Frances O'Connor has third billing, I found her to be too hysterical for a scientist. More Donner influence, I'm sure.

If you have any interest in science, history or good filmmaking, you may want to avoid this one. But if you don't mind totally escapist fare, and like Gerard Butler, Anna Friel or Paul Walker, you may find it somewhat enjoyable. It has so much potential that it is a real shame Donner didn't take his job more seriously. So this is one that someday may make a good remake.

There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.

(Yeah! I wrote those words! Not another critic yet it's a true analysis of this fantastic film!)

  If you loved Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE then TIMELINE (2003) based on the novel by Michael Crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely! Modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor. ON the way and IN the way are knights of not so good caliber, ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there!

  My rating of TIMELINE is FIVE STARS! I can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you, the viewer to truly enjoy it, I'm not! When I saw TIMELINE for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful DONNER PRODUCTION and Billy Connolly, a Scot to whom my heart had been lost. The character of ""Marek"" (Gerard Butler) enslaved me upon my first sight of him! As ""Creedy"" in REIGN OF FIRE I'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that I'd gone to cheer on in the film. ""Creedy's"" torched demise gave me cause to end their existence. ""Marek"" is yet another character such as LADYHAWKES ""Navarre."" (Rutger Hauer) For ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man's man, ""Marek"" is your fellow!

  TIMELINE is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to ""back to the future!""

3713413,3,B0001LQJQW,"I've never read the Michael Crichton novel this film was adapted from. All I've heard from fans of the book was that the adaptation directed by Richard Donner from a Jerry Maguire screenplay was just god awful. I would have to agree with them to a point. Timeline was very bad from beginning until the final half hour where a climactic siege battle between the British and the French saves the film from the awful pile.

Timeline's premise of time-travel by way of some sort of ""faxing"" through a fixed wormhole sounds interesting enough. The theme of 20th-century people in the medieval France of the 14th-century also adds to the interesting story that supposed to have made Crichton's novel such a great read. But even having not read the book I thought the film was bad. The theme of strangers in a strange land was never fully explored and it seemed that each action sequence were there to only serve to keep the film from spiraling down into pure boredom. It didn't help that half of the main characters were wrongly cast. Paul Walker just didn't seem to belong in the film with his one-note performance as a surfer dude when he was suppose to be some sort of archaeology expert. Then add to that his love interest in the form of Frances O'Connor and things just get worse. The acting performances in the flm is salvaged by the work of Gerard Butler as Andre Marek whose chemistry with 14th-century French Lady Claire seemed very genuine. I think the film would've improved dramatically if they just concentrated on those two characters.

Timeline does have one redeeming moment in its entire running time and that would be the battle in the end of the film. The French knights and men-at-arms besieging then storming the English fortification was genuinely action-filled. The technology and tactics used during the battle looked accurate enough to show just how brutal medieval warfare really was. From flaming arrows, night arrows and trebuchets with burning pitch, Timeline actually became entertaining.

But a half hour of entertainment preceded by more than an hour of pure nonsense and boredom could only keep Timeline from becoming one of the true awful films of the last ten years. Maybe things would've been different if the screenplay followed abit more of the complexities of the book. Maybe if the casting of Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor never occurred and other more talented individuals would've raised the level of the film's overall quality. As a piece of mindless fun (well the final half hour at least), one can't do any worse with Timelines, but for fans of the book and more well-crafted filmmaking they should probably skip this film and seek entertainment somewhere else.",1154736000,,2703,4.871739130434783

They switched plotlines around, switched characters around, and the ending....definately not the same.

3713417,5,B0001LQJQW,"If you are a fan of time-travel movies, you will love "" Timeline"".  A group of young present-day archeologists from 1999 go back in time, to April 4, 1357, to rescue the head of their expedition who is already there.  They arrive in the middle of a fictional battle, the Battle of Castelgard, in the Hundred Years War between the French and the English.

The film is very enjoyable for many reasons.  One is that it reveals the immense contrast between the medieval world with the modern one.  Although this exact battle is fictional, much of the film is historically accurate:  the costumes, the way rural cottages were built, etc.  As the film jumps up and back between 1357 and the present, it reveals the huge difference between the two ages.

Gerard Butler as Marek is dashing, loyal and and virtuous.  Anna Friel as Lady Claire manages to be both feminine and feisty.  We actually feel that she doesn't belong in the modern world, that she truly is from this past time.  Their romance, handled with great delicacy, is totally charming.  The combination of romance and action make it a fine date movie.

The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel -- the man responsible for the beauty in such films as ""National Treasure,"" ""The Natural, "" The Right Stuff,"" and ""The Black Stallion."" Both the costumes and the sets are very accurate for the times, and the special effects never jar you out of the movie.

Richard Donner's direction brings coherence to a movie that, because it jumps up and back from 1357 to modern times, could easily be confusing. Donner also directed ""Ladyhawke"", another movie with a very good feel for life in the middle ages.

Donner's other films show his mastery of action scenes, including: ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" (uncredited), the entire Lethal Weapon series, as well as ""Conspiracy Theory.""  Donner at long last received an academy award in 2000 for Outstanding Achievement in Directing.

Yes, you need to suspend disbelief; it is a fantasy!  The ""science""  is fantasy science; some of the history is true, but many of the historical details are pure fiction.

""Timeline"" is a movie you will want to watch again and again.",1151539200,,2155,4.820163487738419

Basically, to give a general view of the plot outline, is that a group of archaeologists which include Gerard Butler, Paul Walker, and Frances O' Connor, have to go back in time to save Walker's father who, having gotten suspicious of a technology institute, got transported back to 1357, Castlegard, France, right smack in the middle of the 100 Years War.

Once back there, the heroes learn the secrets of the markers that they wear around their necks.  The biggest thing to remember is that they only have six hours within which they have to get the professor back to the current millenia.  The stars have exciting run-ins with the English and the French.  Also, there are two love stories weaved into the film including Walker's and O' Connor's, as well as Butler's with a French woman, (Anna Friel).  There are a few very cute scenes between these two which I absolutely loved.

This film ultimately ends in a very exciting way with realistic battle and a surprising, but happy conclusion.

To sum it all up, this movie has everything to offer- action, adventure, romance, and that basically keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.

I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in a good film to watch.

First, I don't think the screenplay was so bad, but in my opinion what killed this movie were the performances by some key actors, particularly the talentless Paul Walker, followed closely by Frances O'Connor.  Gerard Butler was fine in his role as was Anna Friel and Billy Connelly but the other two leads were awful.  Their subpar performances really killed any chance the movie had at capturing an audience.  The action is well done and the music adds a whole new dimension to the film.  For a sci-fi film Timeline doesn't rely on too many computer affects which is nice to see.  However, perhaps if Donner had been more interested or if casting had been otherwise, Timeline would have found an audience.  Marton Csokas & Michael Sheen make an interesting dastardly duo.  With compatent actors in the two main lead roles, this movie would have done so much more.",1146268800,,985,4.815476190476191

Aside from that, I hated when they made Francois say that he was a spy and then kill him for it. STUPID 14th CENTURY FRENCH PEOPLE! oh well. can't be helped. Anyway, I liked it because, of course, Gerry's in it. The genre does seem to be getting a little worn-out though, especially seeing as how almost all he does is period pieces.

Probably due to the compression of the travelers' schedule (37 hours to 6) there wasn't enough time to follow what I think was the most interesting part of the story and gave continuity to it: the evolution of Chris Hughes' character, from that of a 20th century wimpy yuppie scientist to a man of responsibility for his and others' survival (a little like Peter Evans in State of Fear).  Through Chris's eyes (in the book) we could feel the actual horror of the violence and the paralyzing fear, that reflected the stark cruel reality that the archaeologists met head on, in the past they thought they knew so well.  Crichton went into great detail of all this and much of the book was absolutely frightning, but the movie makers completely neglected the intensity and magnitude of all the near death events that were integral to the mood of the story.  Also, Lady Claire's character was all wrong in the movie.  Missing was her sinister and promiscuous, yet seductive, behavior.  I guess there wasn't enough time for that either.  It seems there wasn't time for development of any character for that matter.  How can any screenwriter miss the significance of this?  I was really looking forward to seeing this all play out in a film at the level of Jurassic Park but what we got was closer to Robin Hood.

3713424,2,B0001LQJQW,"I'm not one of those guys who demands that everything make sense in my sci-fi/action movies. A few plot holes don't bug me.

Timeline, on the other hand, seems to be one gigantic plot hole of a movie. It cannot be ignored.

Alright, so these corporate (and therefore evil) scientists manage to ""accidentally stumble"" on time travel when working on a matter teleporter (""kind of like a FAX"") which somehow gets wired into a ""wormhole."" Whatever. So they send people back in time to the fourteenth century for whatever reason, into the middle of a war, and are then surprised when things don't go smoothly.

Nothing in this film makes the slightest bit of sense. Not the bogus ""wormhole"" excuse for time travel (might as well have made it leprechauns), not the fact that the modern day English speakers can communicate flawlessly with the middle-English speakers, not the decision to fix the errors they made by sending a couple of people into the past by sending a whole untrained group there, not the romance that seems to blossom over like 30 minutes between a modern day Scottsman and the aristocratic French warrior-babe, nothing.

Most of these problems seem to be attributable to a questionable plot, but the screenwriters didn't help matters by creating a chaotic, breakneck speed script, laced with poor dialogue, that sacrificed clarity on the altar of having a few more minutes for battle sequences. The directing was shoddy, too and the casting decisions a little questionable at times (like the leading-man who seemed to be channeling Keanu with his surfer-dude delivery).

On the other hand, the battle scenes are decent, and if you're the kind of person who can turn his mind off for action flicks, this might not be so bad. It still won't be great, but maybe two-and-a-half stars.

The visuals, especially of the night battle, were breathtaking. The 'making of' extras on the DVD were top notch...educational and fascinating.

The characters think that because their from the future it will be easy to overcome the middle ages. WRONG!  It still takes team work and know how to develop a plan that gets them out of some hot and sometimes 'tight' spots.  The love theme of finding your place with someone you love was excellent as two people, each from a different time, come together and make their own history.  Evidence is discovered that unlocks these two peoples history near the end of the movie as the other characters realize their devotion to each other. Over all, one character Chris Johnston played by Paul Walker is searching for his father Professor Edward Johsnton, while seeking the affections of a perticular young lady and trying to keep her safe.  The character of Marek also finds a cause that he champions and knowing what history has written decides to change it.  Will he succeed?  The Assistant Professor Andra Marek played by Gerard Butler also provides a wonderful performance as he guides them through history and shows Paul's character that we can make our own history.",1140825600,,1368,4.791489361702127

The time-travelers arrive in the middle of the medieval Hundred Years War at Castlegard, France.  Fantastic special effects are featured in nighttime battle scenes with medieval weaponry: flame throwing contraptions called trebuchet, night arrows, and flaming arrows. Exciting hand to hand combat and swordfighting between Andr Marek (Butler) and DeKerre (Martin Csokas), French Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson) and English Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen) add to the suspense.

There are slight hints of Stargate and Timecop so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci-fi type of category.

In short, the acting and the dialogues are rather weak, while the plot and the setting, are really very good!

Both actors possess the 'X' factor in abundance, and make you want to rush out and buy everything in which they have ever appeared.  One particular scene -- in which Butler's lovely face registers an epiphany of his true identity -- is so over-the-top charming, even my 70-year old mother said it was the 'cutest thing she'd ever seen.'

Buy this movie -- and enjoy Gerry Butler and Anna Friel over and over again, along with lovely epic-style romantic music in the backdrop.

This movie, in many ways, is no exception, so you should know what you're getting yourself into.  I would humbly suggest to anyone that low expectations are the best way to go if you're actually willing to spend two hours of your time watching a film that showcases the afore-mentioned flashing red lights.

Now, with these in mind, one might be ready to enjoy the gems within this movie!  Billy Connolly played the vibrant professor wonderfully; I just wish they had given him more to work with.  The REAL stars of this movie were Gerard Butler, a dashing young actor whom I had never heard of before this movie, and Anna Friel, whose small role is delivered with sparks, and whose face makes one want this movie to be a romance rather than a sub-par action flick.

3713433,1,B0001LQJQW,"In TIME FLIES, an obscure musical-fantasy produced in 1944, British funsters Tommy Handley and Evelyn Dall hop into a time machine and travel back to the Elizabethan era. Thanks to their knowledge of history and the arts, Evelyn helps William Shakespeare finish writing Romeo and Juliet by feeding him his own dialogue, while Tommy gives Sir Walter Raleigh lessons in chivalry. TIME FLIES is a largely forgettable romp, but the point is that even this modest picture contains a couple of pretty clever ideas.

Now, some 60 years and a few million dollars later, comes TIMELINE, a grating time travel tale filled with lots of CGI effects and nary one fresh idea. Although the main characters are whisked off to 14th-century, the filmmakers don't go back any further than BRAVEHEART and the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy as a source for their borrowed concepts, characters, and imagery. (It also steals from the 1960s TV series TIME TUNNEL.)

The plot-or what passes for one-deals with the efforts of an archeologist's son (Paul Walker) to rescue his father (Billy Connolly), who's trapped in 14th-century France thanks to some sort of time travel snafu. Naturally, sonny boy and an intrepid gang of scientists teleport themselves back in time to snatch dear ol' dad from the jaws of certain death. (Though it's a little-known historical fact, 14th-century France was overrun with American actors sporting heavy makeup and phony accents.)

This is one of those empty, slick-but-still-cheesy-looking adventures that should have skipped theatrical distribution and gone straight to UHF-television syndication instead; all that's missing are the Cellular One and KFC commercials.

You know a movie is going to suck when Paul ""zero talent"" Walker is the best actor in the whole film.  I'm not kidding.  Walker has become one of my favorites in Hollywood simply due to his comedically bad acting in every single movie he's ever made.  And his acting skills blow every one else's away in this movie.  It's like they just picked a bunch of shmoes off the street and said, ""Hey guys, you're all going to star in this terrible movie called Timeline with Paul Walker.  Don't worry if you can't act, no one will notice because the movie's so bad anyways and they'll all be focused on the stupid dialogue and Paul's pathetic attempt to appear believable.  Welcome aboard!""

I got tricked into seeing this one because I'm a sucker for medieval war films, even if they're terrible.  But this one takes the cake.  I won't go into all the terrible plot mistakes and innaccuracies, but my absolute favorite part of the movie occurs when some guys are attacking a castle at night with flaming arrows.  Nevermind the fact that flaming arrows aren't going to do much good against a stone castle.  Then the attacking general has a brilliant idea: ""Hmmm... they can see our arrows, since their on fire... maybe we shouldn't light them! Yeh! Then they'll be virtually invisible, since it's night and all!""  He even gives a name to this new, invincible weapon: Night Arrows!  What a brilliant strategic manuever!  His enemies don't stand a chance!  Then all his men applaud his genius as they proceed to decimate the castle with their night arrows.  I was speechless.  I've seen some great military strategy in movies, but nothing compares to this.

So as you can see, not the best of movies.  I suppose you could make a drinking game out of it: one person drinks everytime Paul Walker says something stupid, another person drinks when something doesn't make sense, another when some retarded military idea is proposed, and then another who drinks everytime an actor says ""whoa"" or ""night arrows"".

I probably wouldn't have disliked 'Timeline' so much if I wasn't positive that there wasn't a better movie buried in here. The problems abound, however, and there are unresolved issues pretty much across the board.

The script is an absolute mess. Especially in a time-travel movie, when you create a set if rules for the science of your film, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM. For example, it's commented in the beginning of the film that no modern weaponry can make the leap back. OK, the technology hadn't been invented yet, that makes sense. So what do we see not ten minutes later ... a grenade? I'm not even going to mention how the ending of Merrick's character should have completely changed the future or the way a team of archeologists would so recklessly think nothing of interfering with the past. When writing this kind of a script, a screen-writer HAS to follow the rules he sets for himself.

I also never did come to understand why 3 or 4 people had to get killed going back to save a 70 year old man. Why exactly was he so important that you couldn't just leave him there? There were also a great number of characters were only developed half-way. I'm thinking, in particular, of every employee in the corporation that built the time machine. It seemed like there was more going on there that we, as an audience, were filled in on.

The set design is poor. I couldn't have put it better when another reviewer stated that the film looked like it was made on the back-lot of Monty-Python's Holy Grail. Everything just looked like it was made of cardboard.

Speaking of cardboard, the acting's awful. He seems to be my new whipping boy, but I'll say it again ... PAUL WALKER CANNOT ACT. He HAS to be the worst actor of the modern era. He CANNOT carry and headline a film, he doesn't have the ability. Other then that the cast list was pretty well loaded with talent that was never cultivated properly.

The directing was lazy. I'm normally a big Richard Donner fan. There have only been a handful of movies he's done that I really think were stinkers. Unfortunately, this is one of them. His resume is too loaded with great films to think that this was anything other then a hiccup. I'm not letting him off the hook either though. He had a TON of resources at his disposal and just couldn't bring ANY of it together.

The time and money that were pumped into `Timeline' really should have made for a better product then we were ultimately going to get. I'm instead left with the feeling that I'd be more inclined to just go watch `Braveheart' again.",1128556800,,2700,4.4887983706720975

The movie is highly entertaining, with good acting turns by Gerard Butler, David Thewlis, Michael Sheen, and Billy Connolly, among others.  And even though the concept of faxing people through time (with transcription errors) strains the imagination a tad, they make it work.

The lesson that really strikes home is how callous those with authority can be in this time or any other.  The head of ITC, Robert Doniger, played cooly by David Thewlis, really gives less than a damn about what his process does to those who undergo it, as long as ITC isn't held responsible.  In the 13th century, we have Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen) who stands impreturbed on the castle battlements as arrows and fire sent by trebuchets massacre his men all around him---but why should we be surprised since he murdered one of the hapless archeologists upon their arrival?

Gerard Butler's archeologist, Marek, goes through and intriguing transformation as we see him evolve from a dazed professor into quite a knight himself---he makes the transformation a logical progression as he realizes where he belongs at the movie's end.

Lots of adventure, lots of brutality---mediaval style---, and romances that do and don't work.  In short, something for everyone.  This one is worth the effort",1127088000,,1644,4.989010989010989

3713443,3,B0001LQJQW,"First off, it plays like a Sci-Fi Channel made-for-telly movie.  It doesn't have a big screen feel about it all.  As with all Crichton books - the books are better.  I loved Congo - dismal movie.  Loved Sphere - very dismal movie.  Rising Sun was brilliant - the super novel and Connery were totally wasted.  This one is not a bad movie, but weak movie from another super Crichton book.  Maybe someday they will actually do a movie on the quality of Jurassic Park again!

The premise is intriguing.  Point one, toss out the ""why factor"".  Any time you deal with time travel you run up against the reality questions, so if you like this sort of premise, dismiss the questioning process and it back and enjoy.  Forget it's a Crichton book and you might actually have fun with this film.  The movie little resembles the book, so forget the book.  Whoa that is a lot of forgetting to ask of an audience, but och, audiences were smart, they forgot this film quickly!

The movie runs into all sorts of anachronisms - some of the most ridiculous sort.  It was hard to imagine these actors stood there uttering the nonsense.  While the period feel for the jump back is strong, costumes etc, showed they were trying - the basic plotting and dialogue is the most pitiful drivel.

For a telly movie, this might have been good.  For a big-screen adaption, well one can only say this movie is a sum of its errors.

3713445,3,B0001LQJQW,"""I'm absolutely happy that they made another one of Michael Crichton's books into a movie. At first I thought this movie would be a total blow because Paul Walker was in it and it was all about him, but to my surprise the movie did not revolve around his character. The plot was something new (excluding the time-travel scenario) and I found myself enjoying the onscreen presence of Paul Walker but only because he was not the ""focus"" main character. The action was good as was special effects, the acting was alright on the Male actor's part (Mainly Gerard Butler). However, Frances O'Connor and the guy that plays Walker's father--- is lacking talent, they're characters were lacking in serious likability and personality. This movie is short since it revolves around a certain incident that occurred in 1357 and only major downside to this movie was that the would-be modern-day villain or rather anti-hero in the movie wasn't around long enough for you to actually hate him. I haven't read the book yet so I'm intrigued and want to read it. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes a good time-travel movie with a certain twist to it."" ----The year was: 2003 when I wrote this. When I first watched this movie, I was skeptic from the get-go. After learning of its exsistence throught a Gerad Butler website, I was almost excited, but then I watched the ""TIME MACHINE"" movie and while I enjoyed it, I was right tired of time travel movies and didn't want to see another one of them. The more and more my mother mentioned it was based on a Michale Crihton Novel I never heard of, I kept rolling my eyes and basicly knew the movie would suck because of one denominator. ""I'm so bad in 2F2F"" Paul Walker who couldn't act for scrap. When I watched it --- well it turned out to be a different story. I liked a lot. At one time. This is basically the aftermath of watching it 3 times.

I'm a little less enthusiastic about movietized novels (except for LOTR) now and I'm beginning to see the flaws of the movie. And this was after I read the book when I borrowed it from the library. I gave it 3 stars at best, although I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the movie --- NOW anyway. I noticed that Richard Donner changed quite a bit within the existing storyline and the characters, and the editing for the movie was H-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. You could practically see where they deleted scenes out of the movie due to its tendancy to fly through every scene. One minute they're running and the next they're climbing over a wall and escaping the burning village. The entire primese of this movie was ""Everybody runs"" and that's just what they did. They ran and ran from the british. There was no time for explantions as to why everything in the movie was happening like it was, not enough time for Chritons famous complex explanations for everything he describes he in his books, and too much running throughout the entire movie. Even when they weren't running there wasn't enough of Chrihton's story to keep it interesting. For instance Professor Johnson or whatever his name was, was not Chris' father (although Chris did have a sort of romantic relationship with the female character Kate, but she never objected to it in the book and Chris wasn't oogling over her and bugging her about starting a RRS ""Romantic Relationship""), Gerard Butler's character Andre Marek ---I was currently watching YU-GI-OH! so the mention of the name made me laugh--- was more over indulged in the movie then he was in the book and was a bit too ""jumpy-jumpy"" about his love for the past for my tastes. Kate was all in all the annoying character in the movie. She was played out as though she were one of those ""I wanna do this my way"" type of woman, so she is constantly shown objecting to all the guy's plans of escape or commencement. The French character Francois, had a minor role in the book and didn't join the group on their trip to the past (thus enabling him from being killed). Richard Donner did a good job with the first 3 Lethal Weapon movies, but when it comes to full blown science fiction movies he better leave it to someone who has a little more experience in this area. The acting/dialogue is the run of the mill B-movie type. The only saving grace for this movie aside from Gerard Butler is former ""Xena's Warrior Princess"" actor Marton Csokas, who plays the rouge De Kare (all they were missing was Karl Urban). When the movie reaches its' end, the action consisting of the ""British vs. French amries"", its really lackluster and doesn't have the same flare as several other war battles before it. The end of the movie was a let down. So all in all this movie isn't what its cracked up to be to me anymore. But if you're looking for a good B-movie, ""TIMELINE"" is way to go. ---- [a 3 out of 5]",1126137600,,4784,4.517877739331026

3713448,3,B0001LQJQW,"I got Michael Crichton's book when it came out, but don't really remember enjoying it. I've forgotten most of the book details but when I caught this movie on TV a day or so ago it was immediately obvious that a major rewrite of the contents had been done. I missed 20 minutes or so of this version but what I did see I think I liked better.

I tuned in just as the team was about to go back and rescue the Professor and stayed through the rest of it. It seems to me that the book plot was an ongoing time travel program, not a freak opportunity like the movie, and- in my mind a flawed depiction of time travel by comparison. Crichton wrote something like each trip back was it's own reality then violated that plot by having his professor leave a message which shouldn't have been possible if reality changes when you travel. This plot cleans that up it seems and didn't have too many faults that I could see.

Here apparently too many trips can be very unhealthy and a previous timetraveler (with too many of those trips) has remained behind (he was marooned without a marker(?) and decided to be one of the bad guys.

Our heroes journey back with three or four unarmed marines and only one french speaker, the language guy and two marines promptly get killed by English invaders. The last(?) one- who was responsible for marooning bad guy is killed by him later. The set and costume detail looked very good to me, I didn't really have a problem with much of anything except that the whole story (the trip back, the Professors rescue and the return home)seemed to take place within only about 6 hours.

It barely resembles the book which seems to offend some but Timeline is a pretty good way to spend a couple of hours. I think it is worth owning.",1124409600,,1751,4.378461538461538

3713451,3,B0001LQJQW,"This movie was so cheesy! The writing was poor, the storyline was full of holes, and the dialogue was often unintentionally laughable. Some of the acting was really good, but much of it was awful, and Billy Connolly sounded positively sarcastic--I got the feeling he regretted signing up to do this one and was acting the part under sufference. Worst of all, though, this movie had me siding with the French in the big fight scene! Who the hell would ever WANT to take the side of the French in any fight? Sacre bleu!

This movie will never win any awards, except maybe a Raspberry. And yet, I didn't hate it, mostly because of the cool medieval fight scenes. The storming of the castle was amazing, and the 'Greek Fire', 'night arrows' and trebuchets were awesome! (If you're a weapons geek, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!) The hail of fiery arrows was gorgeously coordinated and filmed, and the battle scenes on the castle ramparts were spine-tingling.

If you're looking for a great film then keep looking because this definitely isn't one. But if you're looking for a mildly entertaining movie for a quiet night in, if your expectations aren't at all high, and if you're also fond of medieval times, you might like to give this ago. It'll pass the time, if nothing else, and you probably won't regret it.

There were several details that could have been left out of the movie, however the movie could have been so much better if they chose to follow the book.

3713454,2,B0001LQJQW,"I wish I hadn't read Michael Crichton's Timeline novel so that I could simply say this is another bland action picture  in a period setting from unimaginative storytellers which neither offends nor thrills. Unfortunately, having read the book, I know better. There was a lot of squandered potential which makes this film willfully bland and disappointing rather than accidentally so.

The basic story is about a group of archaeologists who travel back in time to the 1400's to rescue a fellow archaeologist who is stranded in time. That much of the story is the same as the novel. The problem is that the movie is poorly paced such that there is little drama and that the characters aren't sufficiently fleshed out to make you care if (or when) they die. The bulk of the story seems geared toward getting the heroes repeatedly captured and having them escape as well as to get to the battle scenes as quickly and as frequently as possible.

I'm not one of those people who feel that a novel should be slavishly adhered to at a movie's expense. Books clearly needed to be adapted but they should always lose detail or have the story restructured to the benefit of a movie, not to its detriment as was the case here. For instance, the means by which the characters time travel is altered and greatly simplified compared to the book and that was a good idea.

However, some of the best visual scenes in the book are simply not used in the movie for no reason that I can think of rather than being overly cheap. The opening scene is an excellent example. (Spoiler) When a person repeatedly travels in the story, there are alignment errors which creep into their reconstituted form. In the book, this is shown by a man whose face, body, and even clothing appear to be out of alignment. Instead of doing a little makeup and sewing to show this, a fellow is X-rayed and we're shown microscopic details of this misalignment. As an opening scene, the impact of a slightly and weirdly deformed man mysteriously showing up would have made for much better drama and suspense than the opening scene of the movie. (end spoiler)

It's disappointing that such an interesting book was made into such a boring movie. I hope Michael Crichton sold as many books for this novel as he'd hoped to already because the fact that the movie is so weak is sure to turn people off to the book.",1117843200,,2364,4.592417061611374

Avoid at all costs and read the excellent book that at least does not make out every person from England is the Antichrist, every Scot is a 'Braveheart' and the French are poor, sweet little innocents.

The time travel is what fans of the book were looking for but to me was the least interesting part of an old-fashioned 'Errol Flynn' movie.  The buckles were swashing all over the place as we had sword fights.  We had castles under seige by fire, raining arrows, and catapulting balls of explosive fire.  We had the chaos of the final bridging of the walls and the two sides engaged in one on one combat.

In the 'Flynn' part we had Gerard Butler, and he was a fine romantic lead.  Our fair lady was Anna Friel as Lady Claire.  Their sweet story is played out in way to short a time.

The ingenues are Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor.  Attractive, but bland and banal.  Way too much of the film is watching them run here and there.

Since this was based on a novel, I suppose they had to follow the time travel plot.  But the romantic 'Flynn' type swashbuckling story with the costumes, castles, horses  and scenery would have been a better film.  7/10",1113091200,,1113,4.365853658536586

After I first finished it, I thought that it had to be a movie, and if it wasn't turned into one, I'd write the darn thing myself. Well here you are, it's a movie and a very disappointing one at that. I wouldn't have changed anything to the book, but the movie took away just about everything and twisted the plot a bit too. It turns it into a shallow time travel into medieval times with some romance movie. There WAS a lot of romance in the book, don't get me wrong, but it's so cheesy in this movie. How much of that book can you really fit into 90 something minutes? I think it would have been much better as a miniseries.

The upside?? Gerard Butler, period end of sentence. Every other female who's written a review has commented about him too, but he really is a very good actor.

3713463,3,B0001LQJQW,"It's a familiar story for SF readers, though maybe less so for movie watchers: Our Hero[es] go back in time and muck up some linchpin historical event. History knows where it's going, and makes sure things turn out the way they did anyway. For movie purposes, the good guys (or most of them) win and the bad guy suffers the fate he had planned for them.

The nominal story is that The Professor - Uncle Monty from Lemony Snicket - is an archaeologist, and has hooked up with The Corporation. The time travel thingy can only contact one place and time, oddly enough, the site of his research dig back when it was still current events. (Why is is that time machines can only go to interesting places?) The Prof gets stuck way back when, and The Corp convinces his students to go back after him. The Corp omits a few details, like people occasionally coming back in pieces, and sends them back to collect The Prof. That, of course, is where the fun starts.

The rest of the movie is all running around in itchy clothes, trying to hide from both the English and the French as the coming battle looms, and seeing what their archaeological ruins looked like before they were ruined. A technical malfunction (a hand grenade in the time machine) gums things up a bit, but we needed some reason to prolong the voyage. The female characters are good, certainly not the ""save me"" sort. The male characters are somewhat standard, including a father and son reconciliation in the offing and a few auxiliaries with short life expectancies. In other words, nothing to strain the intellect.

This is acceptable amusement, with lots of great flaming stuff in the medieval night battle. It's only ordinary, but ordinary isn't all that bad.

Ok, I have to say a good part, um...ok, when they fired that trebuchent (spelling, who knows), and it was a pretty neat visual of the first flaming fireball.  Then they fired back that ""magical"" greek fire arrow.  The commander guy goes ""Oh my god,"" and there's an ok scene of the catapult bursting into flames, and then he says ""you are a magician!""  That was neato for about 1 minute and 3 seconds.  Then back to the same boring slow moving uninspired plodding story line.  Who cares if they get back, I was yawning.

They made one last decent philosophical point at the very end about how one makes his own destiny in history.  The message at first is impressive, but then it gets worse every moment you think about it.  Hmm, time travel back to the past, die of some horrible condition only found in the 1300's (whatever the date).

I'll bet that guy would've been there for like 1 year, and then died of some black plague or something.  I want to cry how unrealistic it is.  From having his ear chopped off itself would've probably killed him from infection, oh but it is all worth it for the lovely Mary Ann or whoever that was.  What about excessive bleeding?

Not having read the Crichton novel, I had no particular preconceptions about the movie and, being a sucker for the time travel motif, was looking forward to some thought-provoking, visionary and moving sci-fi.

Instead, I got a very lightweight story, peppered with irritating anachronisms, such as the inhabitents of 14th century France speaking perfectly understandable modern French and/or English.

The now routine Hollywood anglophobia started to bug me after a while (anyone with an English accent is a callous butcher) and, it has to be said, Billy Connoly CANNOT ACT. He hammed it up no end in The Last Samurai, and he does so here again.  There also seemed to be some serious continuity issues with his ever-changing beard-length!

Anna Friel's music-hall comic French accent fails to convince, and the Canadian landscape simply doesn't look French.

Worst of all though, is the sheer lack of WONDER generated by the time-travel sequences.  Maybe this is faithful to the book, in that the main characters have no time to explore and find themselves fighting for their lives as soon as they reach medieval France, but it all felt rather uninspiring to me.

On the plus side, the battle sequences were competently executed,  the trebuchet siege machines being  genuinely impressive.  I am not convinced that 20th century archaeology students would have mastered the lost art of broadsword fighting within 48 hours though!

Now I do not read MC, in fact this was my first book by him I've read and it was good. I try never to read the book before the movie that way I usually enjoy both.
This movie is quite fun, it is well paced and for the most part I really liked everyone in it. I was a bit disapointed by Frances O'Conner she was a bit too girly but it was not too bad.
What I was most disapointed in was that I think it went too fast. Everything wrapped up just too quickly and the relationship between Merek and Claire just was sudden unlike in the book where they gradually grew to care for each other. The subplot of the abandoned traveller from the company that had made the machine was not at all developed as well as it should have been certainly not as menacing or as creepy as he was in the book. But becuase they changed the ""timeline"" (pun intended) from several days to only a few hours it all felt far too rushed and sometimes highly unlikely.
However unlike one reviewer who seemed to think the battle sequences badly contrived the battles/fights were actually extremely well done with acurate armor, fighting and real life work siege weapons. My BF is a total history nut about this stuff and was really impressed and happy with all the costumes and battle sequences.
But the cast was quite good and the film is still enjoyable. The extras are not a lot but are fun....the behind the scenes stuff being the best. Gerard Butler is such a clown and made us laugh with his goofing around behind R. Donners back in one sequence!",1107820800,,1583,4.262458471760797
3713468,3,B0001LQJQW,"It looks, from other ""reviews"", that only astrophysicists have been watching this movie and picking apart something that isn't even possible yet at the level of technology the human race is capable of.

Michael Crichton is the Master of Future Probability. He takes an intriguing idea and makes his best guess at how to solve it. Is the solution perfect? Of course not, because if it was, it would be Science Fact not Science Fiction.

Having said all of that, Timeline can be entertaining if you don't watch it only to pick it apart. Paul Walker is no classically trained actor but his job is to portray a young man who doesn't seem to have a focus in life except to visit Dad and try to charm a woman who is way beyond his capabilites. This he does. Gerry Butler should have been considered the ""hero""; he is the archeologist and expert in the time period, and he is incredibly handsome, beyond the boyish looks of Walker.

The movie is not Oscar material, but it can be entertaining, as long as you don't mind the historical inaccuracies of the weaponry used by the French and English during The Hundred Years War.

I assume that is the only reason anybody would rent this film. He would have to pull a ""full monty"", though, to earn any more stars for this clunker, in which case I for one would happily rate it 5 stars and wear out the rewind button.

  You can't blame the actors for bad script, bad plotting and bad directing. The final ""surprise"" at the end was telegraphed so that even a child could see it coming, which mine did. Paul Walker wasn't any worse an actor than the guy who played Dr. Lupin in Harry Potter -you could see HIS fate coming a mile away also. Walker's look was too ""surfer dude"" for the film, but in the end you felt sorry for ALL the actors involved.

The incredible battle sequences at the castle and the detail on the medieval customs and architecture were wasted on the poorest adaptation of a book I have ever seen. This should have been split into two movies (ala Lord of the Rings) or at the very least run a half hour longer.

Too much of the exisitng footage was wasted on implausible escapes and mindless chases, and not enough set-up was engineered to make the audience believe in time travel or what the connection was between the archeological dig and the medieval war. The concept of the little time-transport amulets idiotic and I found myself neither caring which side won (Emglish vs. French) nor understanding why they were fighting.

Straight-ahead science fiction, poorly done, but watch able. It is short on the science and long on the fiction. I concede all the negative points others have indicated, but I managed to watch it anyway, without too much suffering. It has a couple of love stories that turn out well. The segueing from past to present pretty much was shabby and the movie is more centered in France in the 1300s than in the present. I did not mind the battle scenes and it was interesting to see the English as the bad guys for a change. I thought the ferocity of the English was fascinating.

3713490,2,B0001LQJQW,"""Timeline"" is a textbook example of how a Hollywood action director can butcher a fine sci-fi book by Michael Crichton, who by now must be used to such atrocities (e.g. ""Congo"").  Donner wastes no time on the book's careful buildup to the journey back through time to Hundred Years' War France, and introduction to the technology, ""transcription errors,"" and the corporate Gates-clone who seeks to exploit time-travel as a high-tech business (""Lost World"" redux).  Instead, we get a ticket to a rollercoaster, and a rickety one at that.
Despite the retread themes, Crichton's book delves into both medieval technology and society which is actually interesting - it sounds good, at any rate.  Needless to say, there was character development.
The film largly consists of a 90-minute chase scene through castles and forests, substituting English knights for dinosaurs.  The book emphasized the grace and speed of the better warriors; in ""Timeline"", they are just as clunky as the knights in Monty Python's ""Holy Grail.""  (About halfway through, I found myself wishing these guys would break out in a song while doing a witles stomp-dance on a table.)  And how the main quartet of characters maneuver skilfully through 14th century customs and language (a major theme in the book) is of course a complete mystery.

3713496,1,B0001LQJQW,"What could be duller and more pointless than the 100 years war? Perhaps making a film about a group of archaeologists who time travel to fourteenth century France.
  The originality of this film is that it is so lacking in an original idea. We have been to this place before in the much more interesting and creative `Stargate'.  That film took us on a real adventure to a place where all Earth's history was born and where a force of evil spawned the early gods.
  In `Timeline' we get to visit a grimy pointless war at the close of the dark ages with a group of myopic and expendable characters.  What is the outcome? It is a predictable story that limps along to a forgone conclusion, a waste of talent and celluloid.
  What could be worse than that? Bad acting and worse writing is the answer and it is served to perfection in this oeuvre of trash.  The failure of the film begins with the writing and then segues into the lifeless direction. Richard Donner has never surpassed his pedestrian work on 1978's `Superman'. It all finally comes to a thudding stop at what is referred to as acting.
  Paul Walker is not an actor without talent. He was superb in ""Pleasantville"" and hit all the right notes in ""The Fast And The Furious"". Yet here he squanders his good looks and talent on bad writing and dull direction. Billy Connolly who was so brilliant in `Mrs. Brown' is the one of two who comes off with any grace in this misfire. The other who escapes with little damage is Gerard Butler who is always impressive. He takes some very bad dialog and improbable situations and turns them to his advantage.
  The high school senior year acting class honors however to to Francis O'Connor. Is it the writing that makes her so bad? Almost anyone would have a struggle with such howling lines to read. Perhaps it is a lack of experience. No, that can't be it. She has done some fine work in the past from `Mansfield Park' to `A.I.'. I finally figured out what bothered me so about her in `Timeline'. Its the strangest thing, almost spooky in fact, is the casting of this young actress who looks like she went to a plastic surgeon and asked to be made to look like a middle aged Barbara Hershey. This is what kept me riveted to the screen throughout the unfortunate experience. I was fascinated at the creepiness of the resemblance between the young Francis O'Connor and older and very preserved Miss Hershey.
  Now there is an idea for a science fiction film. An aging actress from the 60's has herself cloned so that her image may go on in films making bad choices and worse films for eternity. That is until someone from the past shows up in a time machine and puts an end to the endless dry rot. Come to think of it, has anyone seen Barbara Hershey lately?

Michael Crichton's novel gets 'medieval' quality in this poorly executed film.  You can read the plot in the description above, but basically, several time travel students go back to 14th Century France to rescue their founder.  There are no great special effects and everything looks like a standard (or substandard) movie sound stage.  The acting is as wooden as the stage sets and every sincere attempt at emotion is embarrassingly tepid.  The medieval castle scenes resemble something Monty Python would assemble and the fighting scenes are cut so poorly that you never know who's hitting whom.  But that's being picky.  My biggest beef is the time machine.  It took years to invent and assemble and gets blown apart in a (really dumb) accident.  But, it is repaired within the six hour window needed to bring everyone back.  How's that again?  Well, this is Hollywood, not literature.  No need to discuss the extras other than to say there is no need for three documentaries on ""Journey through Time"".  Next film please.",1085788800,,1152,4.927083333333333
3713499,2,B0001LQJQW,"When Michael Chrichton's TIMELINE lit up the best seller list in 2002, he portrayed a world not unlike that of his earlier JURASSIC PARK.  In both texts, he transported an intrepid group of scientist-adventurers into a realm than both threatened them and uplifted them.  The film version of JURASSIC PARK managed to maintain this linked thread of danger and wonder, but in the case of TIMELINE, what director Richard Donner has done was to unlink this thread by eliminating both senses and substituting a messy soup of multiple points of view, none of which succeed in engaging the viewer.
The primary problem had nothing to do with the usual trouble spot of time travel movies: the paradoxes inherent in changing the past to avoid a sure catastrophe.  What is at issue here is Donner's inability to present a tightly focused persona with whom the audience could connect.  There was no Sam Neill from JURASSIC PARK who could filter the many divergent viewpoints.  The relatively unknown Paul Johnston, with his surfer dude mode of speaking, simply lacks the gravitas to carry the film.  There were far too many scenes that made no sense.  I had trouble keeping up with identifying the armed knights as French or English.  And when the viewer cannot easily discern one set of potential antagonists from the other, then the director, by default, must rely on special effects to distract the viewer from the logical flaws large enough to steer a time machine through.
The plot mirrors on a superficial level Chrichton's book. An evil scientist-industrialist accidentally creates a time tunnel that can open a portal to 14th century France.  Small groups of 20th century flunkies are whisked back to medieval times where they are stranded, one of whom is the father of the surfer-dude, who cleverly leaves behind some incriminating 600 year old clues to convince his beach boy son to lead a rescue mission.  If the director goes to the trouble of leading the audience to think that one character ought to be the lead, then that character ought to do so. Instead, surfer dude defaults his leader role to a variety of others, all of whom are infinitely more interesting.  There are several subplots that momentarily cause one to forget the lack of a central dramatic vision.  What emerges at the end is a time travel film that shouts out for a firmer hand that should have gripped the director's helm.  Donner was not the firm hand and TIMELINE suffers for that.",1085270400,,2456,4.84688995215311
3713500,2,B0001LQJQW,"This was an ""okay"" movie.  I would have given it three stars had they done one simple thing, eliminate Paul Walker's character.  I haven't read the book, but it seems to me that this character was added as an afterthought simply for Walker's star power.  Normally I would overlook this, but Walker was a constant distraction.  Are we to believe that the son of a Scottish academic turned out to be a California beach bum?  He resembles an overly macho Ted Theodore Logan (Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) who throws around the word ""bro"" like Ted threw around ""dude"".  We find this character in of all places, an archaeological dig in France.  He had no skills essential to the mission, nor did he seem to affect the plot in any way whatsoever.  He was an altogether useless and out of place character.
Reeves was stuck in the character of Ted for a decade until The Matrix.  Like Reeves, Walker is stuck in the role as Brian O'Conner from Fast and the Furious, and unless he learns how to act his career will quietly diminish as his boyish good looks fade.
I can't totally overlook the film just because of the shortcomings of a single actor, but he just got too much camera time....and too little attention from the writers.  This is far from one of Richard Donner's better works.",1085097600,,1301,4.568965517241379

Together as a group the archaeologists (including professors son, Chris, played by Paul Walker) went back in time to save the professor, France, and their future.  Along the way they become better friends, make friends, and lose friends.  Timeline is an adventurous tale based on the book by Michael Crichton (you can buy it on Amazon) which draws you back to the medieval times.

=============================================

This is an entertaining, action-packed, good movie.
No it's not epic like Lord of the Rings, but it's not meant to be.

If you are going to compare it to the book then just forget watching this because you will be disappointed if comparing. If you watch this movie and like it, then consider reading the book. Get the book, its awesome!

Back to the movie review:
1) Action sequences were pretty good. The brief scenes showing the siege of La Roche was an interesting glimpse into medieval warfare

2) The movie feels like a 3+ hr movie crammed into just 2hrs. This worked for some things (kept the action going and gave a sense of trying to fly through the pages of the book because I couldn't wait to see what happened next) but for other things (characterization and plot) it left something to be desired

3) I liked seeing Paul Walker in something different than Fast & Furious. He seemed relaxed and not trying too hard. A likeable character.

4) This is a movie...they forget the science and leave a lot of questions. They found a wormhole. How? Who cares. Deal with it. Read Crichton's PREY and you'll appreciate the brevity of this story's explanation.

5) My wife who was totally ignorant to the book or the movie or Paul Walker thought it was a good watch. We popped the popcorn and enjoyed the continuing downward spiral of situations for the characters.

6) The end was VERY rushed. One second survivors are patting each other on the back and the next frame time has passed and there is some dialogue and the movie is over.

OVERALL: If you can keep and open mind and watch it for what it is, you should have fun and enjoy a very good movie. Hopefully you'll want to read the book afterward and realize it is a GREAT book.",1084320000,,1907,4.456896551724138
3713506,2,B0001LQJQW,"""Timeline"" is like the Amazon discription said good popcorn movie.  I call it great popcorn cheese.  I gave it two stars, but if you are looking at it as a popcorn cheese then it ranks as a 4 star in that genre.
Timeline rapidly explains on how they discovered this wormhole.  They are so quick at explaining how this happened I just feel that they couldn't come up with a good idea its like they talked under their breath and just hoped you really didn't hear how lame of a plotline how they discovered the wormhole.
This movie just had you laughing at the cheesy lines. This should have been on SciFi Channel Saturday night movie.  Its perfect for that.  Great bad acting (Paul Walker, who makes Vin Diesel look like Christopher Walken) and of course cheese lines after line.  Even a nice cute little ending.

3713507,3,B0001LQJQW,"Richard Donner has given us some fine films at his helm:  LETHAL WEAPON series; THE OMEN; CONSPIRACY THEORY, and countless others.  TIMELINE will not be remembered as one of his best.  Based on Michael Crichton's excellent novel, TIMELINE tells the story of time travelers who venture back to 14th century France, to rescue a professor who is stranded there and needs help.  Of course, this experiment is top top secret, and when the time transporter is damaged by a hand grenade, we find our heroes may be trapped in the past.  Crichton's book was a wonderful blend of modern day technology and medieval derring do.  Donner sacrifices a little in the former and much in the latter.  The adventures in the medieval days are purely trite, and even the battle sequences, though vividly filmed, lack the power they so richly deserved.  Along with the script, the film suffers in other ways:  Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor (our supposed romantic heroic leads) pale in comparison to Gerard Butler (so good in DRACULA 2000) and the lovely Anna Friel.  Despite less screen time than the other couple, they generated true chemistry and were much more exciting.  Billy Connolly is miscast as the professor father; David Thewlis as the heartless head of the secret experiment isn't malevolent enough to create tension.  However, in supporting roles, doing nicely are Neil McDonough (Gordon); Michael Sheen (Oliver); and Ethan Embry (Josh).  TIMELINE needed to be in the hands of a true visionary director like Stephen Spielberg or a recklessly adventurous action director like Michael Bay.  As it is, TIMELINE is merely okay, and doesn't achieve the excellence the book deserves.",1083974400,,1672,5.054744525547445

This movie however, is a total wreck. The plot is lost in a sea of overworked special effects. Paul Walker was a horrible choice for his role. The plot changes lose the audience.

3713509,3,B0001LQJQW,"This film is based upon Michael Crichton's marvelous best selling book of the same name. When I first heard that a film was in the making, I was really looking forward to viewing it, as I absolutely loved the book. That it was in the theatres for just about the blink of an eye, however, gave me the idea something might be wrong with it. Having viewed it, I now fully understand why its sojourn in theatres was relatively brief.
Unfortunately, the film bears little resemblance to the author's finely crafted time travel tale. Jeff Maguire, having written a screenplay that seeks the lowest common denominator, just about destroys the author's work, reducing it to an almost incomprehensible piece of drivel. The screenplay takes a five star book and turns into a film that barely rates three stars.
Here, a young group of archaeologists and historians are excavating the ruins of a fourteenth century feudal town in France, which excavation is funded by  the International Technology Corp (ITC), a well-heeled, corporate giant. Some of the archeological finds are puzzling, as they seem to be anomalous to the time period. Moreover, the leader of the archaeological dig, Professor Johnson (Billy Connelly), has  suddenly headed back to the states to ITC headquarters, and they are unable to get in touch with him. They are then all summoned to ITC headquarters by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis), the head of  ITC.
At ITC, they are told that the Professor has been transported by ITC back to fourteenth century France through a worm hole that ITC has inadvertently discovered. Unfortunately, the professor has not returned, and ITC wishes to send them back in time through the wormhole to help with the rescue of the Professor. It appears that their help is needed in order to navigate the intricacies of medieval life. One of them, Chris (Paul Walker), is the Professor's own son, so he needs no urging, Besides, he  has a crush on one of his colleagues, Kate (Frances O'Connor), who is also ready to roll. Another,  Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), is a romantic in love with a bygone time, and he. too, has no problem in going through the wormhole and landing in fourteenth century France.
You know the screenplay is bad, however, when Francois, the only one who is reluctant to go through the wormhole, is told that he is needed because he is the only one who speaks French, as if the French spoken today were the same as that spoken in  fourteenth century medieval France! This would have been a line better left unsaid, as we all know that the French and English spoken today bear little resemblance to that spoken in early medieval times. It is a piece of information about which viewers always automatically suspend belief.
Garbed in clothing that is constructed to resemble that which the people of the fourteenth century would wear and carrying  time travel markers that will enable them to return home, they go through the wormhole.  When our intrepid time travelers, led by ITC security chief Frank Gordon (Neal McDonough), arrive in fourteenth Century France, they are immediately set upon by a marauding bunch of armored English knights, wherein their ranks are immediately thinned. They proceed into the town, where their ranks are further thinned. There, they find the Professor, when they are auspiciously imprisoned with him. Kate, who has excellent climbing ability, manages to help them all escape. They then split up, with Marek, incurable romantic that he is, forging on in his own way to help the Lady Clare (Anna Friel), a French noble woman whose fate spurs Marek on to acts of great chivalry.
They are all brought together for the historic battle between the English and the French over control of the town. There, the English are led by the ruthless and evil Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen), aided by a rogue knight named De Kere (Marton Csokas), who is really none other than a transplanted ITC employee. Marek finds himself fighting against the English in order to save the Lady Clare and makes a split second decision that will forever change his life.
The production values in the film are excellent and the direction is fine, as it is directed by none other than Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapon, Superman). The battle over the town provides some terrific action scenes. The actors themselves are also fine. They all do their best with the little with which they have to work. In the leading man category, however, Paul Walker is bested by Gerard Butler who is engaging as the romantic hero, Andre Marek. In the leading lady category, Anna Friel shines as Lady Clare, besting Frances O'Connor. The problem is that their is little chemistry between Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor. There is, however, chemistry between Gerard Butler and Anna Friel.  Unfortunately, they are all done in by the simply dreadful screenplay for which Jeff Maguire should be flogged.
If one rabidly enjoys medieval festivals and/or time travel stories, or if one loved the book upon which this film is based, then one will garner a modicum of enjoyment out of this film. If not, deduct one star from my rating. In any case, all who are inclined to see this film should rent, rather than buy, it.",1083715200,,5205,4.8524774774774775
3713510,3,B0001LQJQW,"First of all, I must confess that I have not read the novel by Michael Crichton on which the movie is based. Therefore, I cannot comment on the quality and / or fidelity of the adaptation. The movie explores the same idea several others have applied in the past, time travel, but the setting is a period that is not the most usual. It seems that traveling to Arthurian settings is the most successful formula, but in this case the time leap is to the fourteen century in Castlegard, France. ""Timeline"" does not present a lot of new elements or a surprising plot, it is mainly a formulaic approach to a previously explored subject. The only contributions to this ""mini-genre"" are improved special effects and costume and set design.
The movie starts when a man suddenly materializes in the middle of a deserted highway, dressed in medieval clothes and dying; his final word is ""Castlegard"". A representative of an organization called International Technology Corporation (ITC), for which the dead man worked, immediately shows up at the hospital to claim the body and to try to hamper any further investigation. However, the doctors have enough time to find out that the blood vessels and organs in the deceased are misaligned and have no idea what the explanation may be.
At the same time, a group of archeologists that are funded by ITC finds the six-hundred-year-old ruins of Castlegard. Chris, the son of the chief archeologist in the expedition, Professor Johnston, is not very interested in the ruins, but he wants to hang around because he is in-love with his father's assistant.
When Chris's father leaves the site to go to the corporate offices of ITC to talk business, the team at the archeological site keeps on working and makes a stunning discovery. Among the ruins Chris and his beloved Kate, find a note from the professor asking for help and a broken glass that confirms the identity of the sender of the message. Trying to make sense of this Chris and Kate, along with four other friends, go to ITC looking for some answers. What they find is a time machine that was used by the professor to go back in time to Castlegard, France in 1357. Now they have to go back to the rescue and immerse themselves in a dangerous adventure.
This is the type of movie that you should choose to watch being aware that there is nothing outstanding about it, not the acting, the plot or any other aspect. It may be though a good way to spend a couple of hours entertained, since you will not need to pay a lot of attention or follow the action very closely to perfectly understand what is going on. This is definitely a movie that I do not recommend to buy, since I think most people will not find any added value from watching it a second time.",1083628800,,2743,4.6114519427402865

Now, Hollywood is pretty much known for butchering novels through movie adaptations, but this was relentless. The incredible detail and enlightening, thoughtful entertainment of Crichton's novel is WIPED OUT and PARED DOWN so that Paul Walker can have a starring vehicle. I have nothing against Paul Walker, but this just wasn't the movie for him. In fact, I envisioned a totally different cast for a story of this magnitude. This movie goes beyond oversimplification of the novel. On it's own, it's just BAD. It is a 1950's B-movie masquerading as a big budget studio production. I might have found it entertaining if it didn't try to take itself so damned seriously, which it was sort of doomed to do since it was SUPPOSED to be based on the Crichton novel.",1083542400,,910,4.839743589743589
3713512,4,B0001LQJQW,"Timeline is a good movie full of action that may not stay that close to Michael Crichton's novel, but it is still worth a watch.  A government agency, the IFC, has developed a machine that can transport people through time.  The only problem is that is only goes through a wormhole to 1357 Castlegard, France.  A team of archaeoligical students must travel back in time to try and find their missing professor.  Once there, they must survive the English and French armies.  Making it worse is that they are transported back on the day of a French attack on the English army.  The plot jumps around a lot which can make the story somewhat confusing.  Even so, this movie is still a lot of fun to watch with plenty of good action.
  The ensemble cast of Timeline is surprisingly good.  Basically, Paul Walker has to look startled and scream a lot, but he is alright as Chris Johnston, the son of the missing professor.  Frances O'Connor plays Kate Ericson, the romantic interest and a member of the team.  Gerard Butler is excellent as Andre Marek, a member of the team who has a passion for Medieval times.  The movie also stars Bill Connolly, Neal McDonough, Anna Friel, Matt Craven, and Ethan Embry.

3713513,1,B0001LQJQW,"Hollywood is well known for its ability to mangle perfectly good stories but this one seems to set the bar even lower that usual. If you've read Michael Crichton's delicious novel, from which the title (but little else) of this flick was stolen you'll probably start thinking of spending your time more productively sometime during the first 3 minutes - not counting all of the FBI warnings of course. But being a glutton for punishment I watched it all the way through.
Crichton's novel is beautifully worked out with lots of historical & scientific information, decent character development and plenty of action. The screenplay, by Jeff Maguire thoroughly butchers, or to put it more charitably - ignores 90% of this. In fairness though one doesn't know if this is Maguire's fault or his being under orders from the higher-ups at Paramount that insist that scripts be crafted for imbeciles. In any event the end result is a never-ending series of fights & battles, all accompanied by a constant low-frequency rumble (is this supposed to be the scary bit?) that rarely lets up. With all of the slashing, burning & fighting you would think that Maguire - or director Richard Donner (it's tough to know whom to credit for some of these inspirations) would have found a spot for the joust that Chris gets himself involved in - a hilarious bit (in the book of course) - that would have been a relief from the rest of this dribble. But nooooooo, this film takes itself very seriously (ah ha! THAT'S why we have the low rumble going! Serious, foreboding) - no laughing matters here. Another bit that was needlessly changed was how the heroes back at the lab dealt with Doniger. It was a (dare I say) cute, ironic manner of fixing him that would bring a smile to most faces.
As to the acting: Well, what can I say? Do you blast the actors for an inane script that they're hired to read? How many times can you say ""Oh my God!"" before your audience begins rolling their eyes? The girls are cute, the boys have the required look of today. I WAS taken aback by the total absence of any sex scenes. I mean Richard, you've got two great looking gals and at least a couple of studs who would compliment them beautifully. Surely you could have found 3 minutes somewhere to insert something. Hey that scene where they run into the building that is burned down by the soldiers. Chris & Kate could easily have gotten it on right there. Then they could have made their escape in the nude! Come on man, where's your vision? That little bit could have been excised from the TV version - or better still, left in. Think of the ratings!
Then there is the music. Ah yes, the required inspiration of the post-Star Wars flicks. Lots of low brass - for that ominous feel - vamping endlessly on . . . on . . . well, nothing really. ""Composed"" - using the word loosely of course - by one Brian Tyler. Is Mr. Tyler a real composer or, as they say in the Hollywood music community, ""a hummer?"" An ""advanced"" hummer being one that plays around with a synthesizer until he happens upon some suitable noise that the director (or some other genius involved with the flick) approves, and a ""basic"" hummer that well, hums. Neither is known for their real ability to write or even read music. But who needs to read music when we can get ""the computer to do it?"" The obligatory, quasi marching, meanderings are all there of course. Doesn't matter whether we're in the 21st or 13th century - one size fits all. The state of film music is in such a sorry state. It's easy to lay the blame on incompetent ""composers,"" and judging by what we hear, there are quite a few active these days. However, the real blame for the dreck that we so often hear must go to the directors and executives who demand that their own ""tastes"" be quenched.
So, I'm sorry that Michael Crichton's work was so thoroughly abused, though I suppose he was paid handsomely to stay away from the project. After all, we ARE a civilization that plays by the rules of the almighty dollar.",1083283200,,4016,4.52544704264099
3713514,3,B0001LQJQW,"Time-travellin yarn about a group of modern day students who travel back to 1357 France to save their history professor. After becoming quickly embroiled with bloodthirsty knights, the bubonic plague, and a full-fledged war, the movie sets itself up to be a reasonable attempt at the already overdone time traveling theme. Unfortunately, despite the pedigree of the Michael Crichton bestseller on which it was based, the movie rapidly becomes bland and predictable, and too reliant on the viewers willing suspension of disbelief. Suffering from a surprisingly weak script (considering the book for a moment) and fairly average performances the movie struggles to really get going which is a shame. Although the representation of a war torn Middle Ages Europe is visually impressive, the rest of it just gets rather numbing, and one feels that the movie was deservedly chewed by the critics after it's cinematic release last year. Paul Walker (The Fast & the Furious) may wish to forget that he picked this movie as a vehicle to catapult his growing stardom, as only his most ardent fans will find much to shout about.

3713515,4,B0001LQJQW,"This movie has been panned by quite a few Michael Crichton purists.  Well, I'm a Michael Crichton fan myself, but I thought that this was a pretty good movie.  Not perfect, but then again neither was the book.  But very thought-provoking (like most Crichton science fiction novels) with a skillful use of science and scientific speculation.
The story is simple enough (no spoilers here).  A limited form of time travel has accidentally been discovered, and a leading scientist has become trapped in the past--specifically A.D. 1357 France.  A rescue team is formed to go back and get him.  But when they arrive, they discover that the era they have entered is a violent, tumultuous one, and they quickly lose control of their mission and are swept into the violent world around them.  More would be telling, but this is a pretty good yarn.  It also avoids most of the pitfalls of other time travel stories, i.e. the paradoxes and the incredulity that arises from them.
The book did an incomparably better job explaining the time travel technology (in Crichton's peerless fashion) than did the movie, which I thought gave this component of the story short shrift.  However, the book got pretty bogged down about midway through, while the movie maintained better continuity of story.  Further, I thought the movie ending was incomparably better than that of the book, and was in fact beautifully done.
The special effects in the movie are not bad either.  The catapults, the Greek Fire, and the battle scenes were very well done, and quite realistic.  They managed to convey the central concept of the story--that this was a violent place and time, a time of war and conquest.  I thought that the acting was pretty OK, if not exceptional.
Overall, quite a good movie; one that I'll watch more than once.",1083196800,,1801,4.84640522875817

3713519,1,B0001LQJQW,"Ever had one of those crazy dreams (probably after you've made one too many trips to the salad bar at Medieval Times) where you suddenly find yourself back in the year 1357, holing up in a French castle while all around you French and British forces are enacting the Hundred Years' War?  If you have, it was probably more interesting than what we see in ""Timeline"" - and if you haven't, I am sure you could come up with a more convincing and intriguing scenario than the makers of this film have devised with the same material.  Though based on a Michael Crichton novel, ""Timeline"" is about as bad a sci-fi fantasy as anyone could ever possibly imagine.  In this time-tripping tale told by an idiot, a group of modern-day archaeologists in France are transported through a ""wormhole"" to 14th Century Europe to help retrieve the leader of their dig who has (don't ask how) become stuck in the past.
Time-travel yarns require a certain intelligence and finesse to make them both intriguing and convincing.  ""Timeline"" is ludicrous from the very outset, for less than five minutes after our intrepid little heroes first learn of the existence of the way-back machine, they are all suited up in their Medieval garb and heading back in time, utterly unprepared for what they might find there.  Once they get to their destination, the plot bogs down in endless scenes of armored men on horseback a-hacking and a-hewing away at the anachronistic visitors.  I mean, whose bright idea was it to set up this time machine premise and then send the characters not forward into a potentially interesting future but BACKWARDS to take part in a creaky, hackneyed Medieval romance?  It's one thing to set up this time-bending scenario; it's quite another to do absolutely nothing with it.  Oh sure, there's the usual deep-think palaver about whether or not these folks from the future should risk tampering with history etc., but the filmmakers' sights seem to be set on more mundane matters like elaborate action and fight sequences and puppy-love romance.  And, of course, all these archaeologists turn out to be expert swords- and bowmen, fully the equal in skill and talent to their 14th Century brethren.  On the whole, the acting is amateurish, the dialogue inane and the special effects virtually nonexistent for a film of this type.  The film, in fact, both looks and feels like a third-rate, throwaway project designed for no purpose other than to give Paramount Studios a corporate-loss write-off come tax time.

The fire lit arrows being shot into the sky towards the castle was an awesome sight. True the movie could've been better, but not everyone can do a Michael Crichton novel justice like Spielberg did with Jurassic Park and JP 2: The Lost Word.

  First, lets dispense with the plot. Time travel stories can be tricky, but not this one. ""We cannot disturb the past"" one on-screen village idiot spouts, but then they proceed to go back into the past and start killing people, setting fires and generally alter history - WITH NO ILL EFFECTS!!
  You don't want to be seen or heard on this rescue mission? Fine, quickly gather a small team of mercs and historians with some military training (believe me, they exist) who can speak  English with no accents, and can speak some French or at least understand it; arm them with tranquilizer guns, modern repelling gear, night vision and knockout gas and have them operate at night only. Did ANY of this happen? Of course not.
Let's not forget another one of my favorite stupid stupid plotlines: sending a Frenchman, who has no common sense and poor vision, back into the past...behind the battle lines of the English! ""We need him!!"" the lead character screamed. Can you guess what happened to him?
  The lead character was another problem: making googly-eyes at the female archeologist during swordfights, whining and generally acting the fool. My favorite person, however, in this ""Supertrain"" of a movie was the mercenary guy who brought a grenade back to the past. Guess when he pulled the pin?

3713527,3,B0001LQJQW,"When it comes to movies about time travel the one that serves as a bench mark for me is ""Somewhere in Time,"" where on the one hand you have the absolutely stupid idea that you can travel to the past by thinking yourself there, but on the other there are some memorable moments, such as the beginning when the old lady tells Christopher Reeves ""Come back to me,"" and the point where he discovers that Jane Seymour is smiling at him when the photograph that captivates him was taken way back when.  The great lesson I learned was that since time travel is impossible you are going to have to jump ahead to the willing suspension of disbelief for any of it to work at all and that ultimately the value of the film is if it has anything interesting to do with the idea of time travel.
With ""Timeline,"" the 2003 film that director Richard Donner (""Superman,"" ""Lethal Weapon"") made from Michael Crichton's novel, the suspension of disbelief is not that hard to manage.  Once upon a time there is a company that was trying to find a way to send three-dimensional faxes (i.e., a ""Star Trek"" transporter), and they discovered that they were sending packages to not just another time but another place, namely 14th century France.  We are told this is because there is a stable wormhole, at which point we nod our heads over that oxymoronic notion and look forward to what interesting things we get to do with this set up.
What we get is the siege of a castle, held by the English, by a French army.  What we do not get is a real reason why this has to be part of a time travel movie.  The reasoning in the film is that the archeolgoist (Billy Connolly), who has been digging up the site in the present, has become stuck in the past, and his son (Paul Walker) and colleagues (Frances O'Connor and Gerard Butler) are sent back to help find him.  However, my suspicious mind thinks that maybe what happened was that Crichton had a time travel novel that was not going anywhere and a story about the siege of a 14th century castle that had no real purpose, and he threw the two of them together, because the sad fact is that ""Timeline"" just does not get those two halves to fit together (there is a marvelous metaphor for this early in the film where one time traveler has made too many trips and his spine and other key body parts do not match up perfectly anymore).
My preference is for the castle siege part of the equation; a straightforward movie about a medieval siege would be pretty interested and Donner gets points for doing most of the fun stuff here without resorting to computerized effects.  But the assault keeps getting interrupted by the attempts of the time travelers to find each other and get themselves home.  Then there is the whole fear about changing the future, which seems rather moot because these people are so far beyond the butterfly effect stage that trying to get history back on track seems rather laughable.
Of course this gets tied up with a romantic plotline when one of the time travelers falls for a young woman he meets, only to discover she is the one whose death marks the turning point of the battle.  At that point you know he is going to be able to have his cake and eat it too, and the question becomes whether this film can come up with a really neat way of carrying it off.  The short answer is ""No,"" it does not, and for those who are fans of time travel films the obvious comparison is going to be to ""The Final Countdown"" (What if the U.S. had a nuclear powered aircraft carrier at the attack on Pearl Harbor?).  But then I am still trying to figure out why Walker is playing Connolly's son and not Butler given their accents, but then I also trying to understand why the trailers think that Walker and not Butler is the ""hero"" in this story.  Then again, if you could show this film to an audience in 1557 I bet they would be really impressed by how this one came out.",1082246400,,3906,4.387275242047027
3713528,3,B0001LQJQW,"Without regurgitating all the old canards about the problems posed by the tranposition of literary works to the screen, let's just say that this adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel is decent, if not overwhelmingly so. Coming as it does on the heels of LOTR I/II/III, practically any film based on a novel will fail the test - this one's no different.
As popcorn entertainment, though, it's perfectly serviceable, if a little too compressed. Crichton's conundrum takes place over 36 hours, Richard Donner's adaptation reduces that to 6. The rest can easily be derived from that fundamental change. On the other hand, where Crichton needs time, literally, to describe life and the physical environment of the 14th century, a film can accomplish the same in an instant. LOTR (all three, for example) - in the original, verbal format, spends an inordinate amount of time describing things - places, the weather, emotive states, etc.
Can anyone say with a straight face that the issue of ""acting"" should even be mentioned in such a film as this? Please, hang it up. I suspect the cognoscenti of science fiction film have come to ""expect"" everything will boggle the mind and the eyes. Sorry. This is a perfectly decent film of its kind. I would have preferred a lot more detail, and not nearly as much compression - but it's interesting that even so telescoped, the film still runs at 115 minutes. Think about it.
Read the novel - see the film - then read the novel again. I don't expect my comic books to be the source of great revelatory anything - just plain, simple fun. Why, even the LOTR films had to cut the guts out of the original material - to get it down to 9.5 hours (theatrical versions).
My only real problem with the film is the score - which is horrible. Poor Benny Herrmann and John Williams, good composers both, have been ripped off so many times now that all one has to do is to establish a characteristic syncopated martial ostinato, then play it to death. Such was the case here, in spades. As a composer, I find such things maddening in the extreme. A bad score can take a weak film and really do it in. This one does virtually that to this film.",1082246400,,2166,4.6139896373057
3713529,1,B0001LQJQW,"After months of procrastination, I finally got around to finishing the book of Michael Crichton's TIMELINE. I thought it was amazing, an absolute must-read. I waited until after I had finished the book to watch the movie, because I didn't want my mind tainted by a director's vision. I realize now that that director's vision needs contact lenses.
There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start.
The first thing that's wrong is the intro scenes. The entire sequence of the man appearing in the road and dying at the hospital is completely rushed, and might as well not have been included in the film. The connection between the man and the dig at Castlegard is completely obliterated.
Another thing that bothered me was the relationship between Chris and the professor, which is described as fatherly in the book, not as the professor actually BEING his father - a fabrication of the screenwriter. Kate isn't supposed to realize that Chris has any feelings for her, and Marek's character seems unlike the one described in the book. Another thing that's left out is a vital clue on the parchment, along with the professor's plea for help.
Many of the characters are changed. Doniger is much older than described in the book, and Kramer has been transformed into a man. The character of Francios is an invention for the film, and totally unneccessary. A couple of military-types are added to the group that is sent back. In fact, there should only have been 5 people sent back - Kate, Chris, Marek, the man who set off the grenade, and the one who was beheaded (which should have been a woman, as in the book). They also conveniently have 14th century people speaking modern English as opposed to Occitan, like the book has it.
There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it was hard to sit through. I only finished it because the friends I was watching it were eager to see it. It's as if someone cut-and-paste a dozen words from the book and told someone else to make a screenplay. This movie is horrible. The acting is lamentable.

3713532,3,B0001LQJQW,"Michael Crichton always tells two stories in his novels: a good story with strong characters, and a lot of scientific research.  His novels are usually two novels in one.  With TIMELINE, he spends a heck of a lot of time describing the quantum physics behind the time machine: cosmic foam, multi-universes, transcription errors.  It takes Crichton about 200 pages to describe all of this.  In the film, all of this is reduced to about 20 minutes.  The physics of the machine are reduced to a sort of ""Hey, it's a time machine and it works.""  That's about all the quantum physics you're going to get in order to get in nearly an hour of battle sequences.
The thick Irish (or Scotish?) accents are also difficult to understand at first, especially since these characters carry most of the background information you need to understand why the scientists are building a time machine in the first place.
I would have been happy to settle for fewer battles and more explanation of the quantum mechanics in the beginning.  This is the true heart of the novel.  Without spending some time here, the movie just becomes a high-tech swashbuckler.  Also missing are the tensions and in-fighting of the executives of the technology company that built the machine.  Without this, the final sequence is denied any depth of meaning or irony.
The DVD transfer is excellent.  The extras do go on a bit about the making of the movie. It turns into a sort-of ""let's pay endless homage to Richard Donner."" The emphasis is on the technical side; the actors are not profiled in much depth. I was disappointed that there was no special feature on the quantum mechanics that Crichton built his story on.

3713538,4,B0001LQJQW,"While it has been a while since I have read the book, ""Timeline"" was just one of those stories I truly enjoyed. The movie, while omitting some parts of the novel, actually follows the general plot of the book. A few changes are made to the beginning and end, but overall the actual storyline is similar to the novel. Many of the parts cut out of the book are actually parts that, given the cast, are better left out. The majority of these scenes involved the character Chris, played by Paul Walker. Luckily, the movie does not make him the main character like he was in the book. The less screen time of Paul is definately better. My favourite character in the book, Andre Marek, is excellently portrayed by Gerard Butler and he saves the film from being completely worthless. Anna Friel as Lady Claire as well as other supporting characters are also great performances.
I understand why many would not like the movie since there are many others in a similar genre. For me, I have never really been into these kind of movies and while I am an avid Crichton reader, I did not read this book when it came out due to it's subject matter. When I finally decided to read the book on a flight, it became my second favourite next to ""Jurassic Park"". This was the first film I really saw about medieval times, and even though the movie could have been better, I enjoyed it. I think this was because I love the story so much and the movie was not a total detour from this story.
A few points to make that many people seem to nit-pick about:
1. The fact that they changed Chris' character to be the son of the professor instead of his student is not a big deal. Also, I don't see why it isn't plausable that he could not be the son of a Scottish professor just because he is American. This is the stupidest argument I have ever heard since I know many people who are American and have foreign parents!
2. Yes, the fact they spoke American when they went back in time was definately unplausable, however, I would have preferred this than to see subtitles the whole movie. This was made from a sci-fi novel, it was not mean to be an ultimately realistic or overly historically accurate movie. They should have kept the earpieces from the book in though to explain it.
Overall, I really like the movie, and think people should give it a try. While it's definately not perfect, it is fun and keeps fairly true to the book.",1081555200,,2408,4.389261744966443
3713539,1,B0001LQJQW,"Because I loved this book so much I was expecting very little from the movie. That's how it generally works with Michael Crichton, and I've learned my lesson after Congo, Sphere, and Lost World, all great books and poor movies. And even with making such low demands on the film, it still topped them all. This is possibly Crichton's best novel and definitely the worst adaptation, maybe the worst adaptation of any popular fiction book ever.
Timeline failed on every level in which a movie can fail. The acting was atrocious by just about everyone who had the misfortune to be involved, the adaptation is a shred of what the original story is, the dialogue sounded as though it were made up on the spot by the actors, the 14th century realism was on the level of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and the casting couldn't have been worse if you'd been trying. The whole movie had a low budget feel to it, producing a result I would've expected ten or fifteen years ago before audiences really cared.
The movie (not the novel) is about several archeologist/graduate students who travel back in time to rescue their professor who's been trapped in 14th century France. They only have six hours to do it or else they're forever stuck there. Nobody can go back and rescue them after their six hours have expired, despite the fact that that's exactly what they are doing to the professor. Once they have journeyed back in time things start to go predictably wrong in the past and in the present. Using their knowledge of history, the archeology kids manipulate the armies of England and France while trying to fix various anachronisms they've introduced and not create new ones in the process. There's love, war, even unintentional comedy. What more could you ask for in a film?
Answers below.
1. Acting - I'm going to just say it: Paul Walker (Chris) is the worst male actor I've ever seen in a major-budget movie. Hands down. Worse than Keanu, worse than Vin Diesel. The only thing that helps him in this movie is Frances O'Connor (Katie) who is, amazingly, even worse. What makes it so unbearable is that the storyline keeps Paul and Frances together for most of the movie, so we get to see these two gems with no one else on screen to hide behind. In the spirit of honesty, I have to say that I've seen better acting in porn. I hope for the sake of film that Paul Walker isn't the flavor of the month long enough to ruin more potentially good films, not that Timeline is really in that category.
2. Plot - The adaptation of Timeline drastically departed from Crichton's novel and in all the wrong directions. I realize that certain aspects must be changed from a book to make the movie work, but there's a certain point at which the story can become so severely mangled that any reason for the story existing in the first place is gone. That's what happened to Timeline. Why was Timeline a huge bestselling novel? Because it was the first technically plausible time-travel story that we'd ever read. It combined detailed fact with fiction in the seamless way only Crichton can do it. And it painted a realistic picture of how such technology might be exploited if they were developed. Without that, it's just another brainless sci-fi story. Now here's the point - *none of those things made it into the movie!* That's what made it great, and none of it's there. The result is a convoluted mess that is hard to follow even if you know the rough storyline.
3. Realism - Director Richard Donnor made it a point in an interview to state that he was going to favor actual sets instead of special effects. I'm all for this generally - if you're actually going to put some work and money into it. One problem that epics such as Braveheart and Lord of the Rings have created is that half-hearted offerings such as Timeline are pallid and limp next to them. Half a dozen English soldiers clumsily drawing their swords while dramatic music plays just isn't going to cut it. Nor are ""night arrows,"" which, though I'm not a history expert, I'm pretty certain never existed as a legitimate military threat, certainly not on the cunning level of warfare mastery with which they are depicted in Timeline. And the ""If we don't leave it here then we'll never find it in the future!"" moments give me another reason to cite Bill and Ted as a comparison.
If Michael Crichton wants a good movie made out of one of his books, apparently he's going to have to write the screenplay himself as he did with Jurassic Park. I understand that he pioneered a new kind of contract with Timeline, accepting a percentage of the Box Office in lieu of a set dollar amount. I have to wonder how he felt about that decision after seeing the first cut of this epic disaster.",1081036800,,4737,4.587264150943396

The director, Donner, paces the action briskly and seems unaware or simply unperturbed by the campy dialogue supplied by Crichton's adapters -- writers Jeff Maguire and George Nolfi. Similarly, the actors tear into these thin roles with a passion worthy of Shakespeare. This ""over-acting"" may be enough to draw some people away.
All-in-all, Timeline is not a masterpiece, but it is a film that is a personal favorite. It is a typical movie that you hear about opening weekend, and than may go the rest of your life without hearing from it again. Timeline is a film you should see, but not one you should purchase without giving yourself your own opinion.",1080432000,,949,4.72289156626506
3713542,1,B0001LQJQW,"Well, I am the last one to say that a movie is bad because I look at movies for entertainment, not some deep purpose or meaning.  I must say that Timeline is BAD!  While bits and pieces of the movie are similar to the book, overall, this is one of the worst adaptations that I have ever seen.  The main point of the story is the only thing that even comes close to the book.  The rest of it, well, isn't even close.
As far as entertainment value, I would have to say this movie has little.  The only saving grace is the battle scene at the end of the movie.  The rest of it was dry and very un-entertaining.",1080086400,,607,4.016666666666667
3713543,1,B0001LQJQW,"The book ""Timeline"" is a really awesome and fascinating book about the whole concept of time travel, even if it is too far fetched for it to ever become a reality. I was amazed at the books concept and wondered how they would be able to adapt it to the big screen.
 Sadly, whatever was good about that book is thrown right out the window when on the big screen adaptation. This movie just soils the fun of the book and the result is a totally atrocious and absolutely laughable stinker of a movie. This movie in fact feels almost nothing like the book, not that I was expecting a whole lot to be taken out of the book and placed onto the movie but even when looking at it from a non-reader, this movie is just plain awful.
 The acting by almost all of the cast is hollow and the directing is just lame. In fact, I haven't seen a movie that was so badly miscast like this in many years, at least since ""Batman & Robin"" from years back which was also awful in it's own right. ""Timeline"" is one of the prime examples of how they could take a great and amazing book with an awesome concept and rob it of all of it's meaning with a really mindless mess of a movie and ruin the book's legacy.
 While it's far from being one of the worst movies of all time, that belongs to ""Dumb and Dumberer"" and ""Gigli"", ""Timeline"" is one of the weakest movies of 2003.
 Tell Paramount and Company to go back to the movie studio and start all over on this movie because I refuse to accept this as an adaptation of the Crichton Novel.
 A total disappointment. Do not waste your time on this movie.",1079136000,,1575,4.184818481848184
3713544,1,B0001LQJQW,"I am a very easy-going fan of both books and movies, easy to please and very diverse in my tastes, so I am almost ashamed to write this review, but here goes...
Avoid this movie!
I absolutely loved the book and expected the movie to vary, but this was a horrible adaptation of one of my favorite books.  Marek was portrayed decently, but the other characters were flat and poorly acted.  The movie was not well paced and had I not read the book I would have had no idea what was going on.  The only parts of the book taken were the concept, the beginning (very loosely) and parts of the end (again very loosely).  What they decided to do in the middle was a complete mystery.  I feel that this book could very easily become an excellent film ... someday (Keep it away from Paramount). I have come to the conclusion that Donner can't direct and couldn't have survived without an excellent actor/actress with charisma in his films (like Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapons).  This movie was one of the absolute worst films I have seen in recent years.  It beat out my old modern all-time bad film: MI-2, which at least had some action at the end to salvage an otherwise horrid film.  Unfortunately this film had no saving graces as such.  Again, I love the concept, I love the book, but keep Paramount & Donner away from good ideas, they will tear them apart to make ... yet another bad movie.
P.S. - another bomb of a movie to steer clear of is, (drumroll please) yet another Paramount production, Star Trek: Nemesis.  They took something they've had for years, a great show, then good movies & made an absolute stinker of a film.
I think I put more effort into this rant than the filmakers did in any of the mentioned movies in this 'review'.
If your looking for a medieval type film, watch something like Kevin Costner & Morgan Freeman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, or a good time travel movie, watch a Terminator flick (good for the action anyway), Frequency or the Back to The Future Trilogy.  Don't waste time or money on this film.  Buy the book, you won't regret it.",1078963200,,2073,4.426315789473684
3713545,4,B0001LQJQW,"While many feel this film is not very true to the book, it is a pretty fair film adaption of the book. Most of the MAJOR elements are kept in the film and those areas cut mostly involved the character Chris, which is a good thing since it means less Paul Walker.
The first 15 minutes pretty much cover the first half of the book, and the rest is kind of spread out over the next 115 minutes.
True, when they go back in time they do not take into account the language barrier of Middle English and Middle French, but personally, I wouldn't want to sit through the movie with subtitles, which would have to be present if they kept this in the movie. They could have kept the ear piece part of the book, however, to explain at least part of this.
Also, many people seem to feel that Chris being the professor's son is crazy since the professor is Scottish in the movie and Chris is American. Um, believe me, there are plenty of people in the world who have fathers who are of another country and have another accent... I really don't understand this critique.
The acting may not be top notch, although Butler is definately the stand-out performance of the bunch, but I have seen far worse acting in other movies.
Overall, this is a good movie, not great, but worth watching. Personally, I adored the book and I like the movie. I feel, even with the few changes and unrealistic moments, it is a fair adaption. It is definately NOT the worst adaption of a book EVER... That would either go to ""Bonfire of the Vanities"", ""Congo"", ""Sphere"" or some other I cannot think about. At least most of the general plot and events are present in the movie, even if they are changed slightly.
If you are going to compare this to other medieval movies, or try to take it too seriously (as many seem to be doing), then this movie is not for you. Sure it may not be the caliber of Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, but I don't feel it was meant to be. It could have been much better, but it is not as much of a disaster as many keep exclaiming.",1077667200,,2022,4.268229166666667

The extras also help folks to understand the movie as well. All the actors do a good job and it's also fun to see the circle of event happen in the past that come full circle in the present.",1527552000,,318,4.063492063492063
