3444928,3,B0019ZYD0I,"I agree with the reviews. It's because of Tischa Campbell that this funny show went off the air. ""Martin"" was hands down the funniest comedy on around that time. I still give Martin Lawrence and the crew their props but the inly reason i'm buying this season also is to have the complete collection. Martin and Gina not being together in episodes just didn't seem normal. RRRR...makes me angry that it had to come to a halt.",1220918400,7,424,4.51948051948052
3444929,3,B0019ZYD0I,"I agree with the other reviews that the Fifth Season, sans a few episodes, was not that great.  It is too bad that this show only lasted 5 seasons.  My husband and I still watch the show after work to get our laugh on. I am getting the complete Fifth Season just to complete my collection.",1219190400,,289,4.142857142857143
3444930,2,B0019ZYD0I,"Tisha Campbell left in the middle of the season, thanks to Martin Lawrence's constant advances towards her and other stuff.  Most of the episodes were getting to be more stupid before she left and it took on to a whole other level after she left.  Some episodes I do like such as the Prince Oochie episode and the Jury Duty episode plus a very few, but thats it.  It was clear that Martin no longer appeared as his other alter egos (besides Shenehneh twice), but the show had officially jumped the shark and writers had just ran out of fresh new ideas.  Jokes were getting old at that point (the 90's are almost over...get with the times).  Although its one of my favorite TV shows, but everyone of them craps out in its final seasons and fans do not get surprised when they go off the air.  I have all four seasons which were all great, funny, and fresh, but this one here is stale and I decided to keep my $29 this time.",1219017600,6,922,4.2701149425287355
3444931,4,B0019ZYD0I,"Martin - The Complete Fifth Season is the final season of this '90s hit show. It's pretty sad this funny sitcom only lasted five little seasons. Tisha Campbell is rarely seen, she had issues with Lawrence and would only finish the finale if Martin agreed to keep his distance from her. This season is bittersweet, they are still some hilarious moments but the cast who had excellent chemistry the first 4 seasons is now gone and you can feel it. I highly recommend purchasing this groundbreaking show, good memories!",1217376000,29,516,4.808988764044944

With all of the backstage drama going on, one could tell the show was coming to an end. I bought this season just to complete the collection, but it is my least favorite. The cast held it together though, as best as they could. There are some funny episodes, just not as good as the previous seasons.",1466985600,,407,4.1645569620253164

3444994,5,B0019ZYD0I,"By Season 5 of the show, things had really changed with the show; the dynamic and the chemistry between Martin and Gina who were the hearts of the show had changed and everyone had took notice to it. There are episodes where Martin took a backseat to Pam, Cole and Tommy and Gina is nowhere in sight. Regardless of Season 5 not being some fans favorite of the five season ,this show is still very much one of the classic shows of the 90's. It ranks number one to me with Living Single and Hanging with Mr Cooper following behind.",1440979200,2,529,4.3

3445000,3,B0019ZYD0I,"As many have said, this season was not as funny.  I know on the show that Gina had moved up in her company, but I did not like the snooty attitude at times.  Especially when she grew out her hair, and started to wear all of that overdone makeup on her face.  She tried to be funny, but it seemed fake at times.  It was though she tried real hard to work with Martin, the best that was possible.

Martin was distant at times.  When they did the episode with them finding jobs elsewhere together, it was obvious that he was really sad before walking out the door.  It had to be really hard working together all those years, and to leave on a sour note.",1437868800,,650,4.111111111111111

The only thing I hate about that Tisha Campbell left the show in the middle of Season 5 after she sued Martin Lawrence for sexually harassment. I think Martin harassed her after they got done taping an episode probably was the Back In Trouble episode. The rest of the episodes on Martin Season 5 just wasn't the same without Tisha Campbell. At least, she came back to the show to finish the series (on the last couple of episodes). Imma still give it a 5 star rating.",1394755200,,572,4.305555555555555

Martin Lawrence is an outstanding comedian, as well as, the others actors:  Tisha Campbell, Tichina Arnold, Thomas Mikal Ford, Carl Anthony Payne, II, Garrett Morris and Jonathan Gries.  They are spectacular in their own right but very, very good in this series and I would love to see thm come back with another installment of ""Martin,"" maybe from another city, other than Detroit.

3445096,3,B0019ZYD0I,"Ok, I purchased Martin the complete 5th season to complete my collection and because the price was right. Most of the reviews  I read were negative but, I figured, how bad could it really be considering Martin the complete seasons 1 thru 4 was great and full of laughter. In season 5, I could tell almost immediately that the writing of the material had changed and it just wasn't funny anymore. Early on in season 5, Tisha Campbell was noticeable missing  and the other cast members just could not pull it together to carry the show without her. There were  very few outtakes in season 5 which was a bummer for me because I really enjoyed looking at them in the previous seasons. I missed the character's Martin Lawrence played  and made popular in the other seasons as well. Bottom line is, if you want to complete your  collection, this is a must have, however, if your buying for any other reason, DON'T bother.....",1286755200,3,919,4.579268292682927

3445101,3,B0019ZYD0I,"One of the funniest and greatest sitcoms of all times really took a nose dive in its last season. Although The characters of Tommy, Cole and especially Pam did their absolute best to keep this show above the water, but with the lost of Gina and Martin's ups and downs it was really tough. I really hated to see this show end the way it did. In my eyes, I believe Martin and Gina could have carried this show far longer than where it was even up til this day because the cast was perfect and they all worked so well together. But, I guess everything has to come to an end. But, I agree with some you. They should try for a second run someday!",1233705600,4,641,4.095238095238095
3445102,3,B0019ZYD0I,I have purchased Martin seasons 1 - 4 and love them.  The fifth season however is not as funny and well written.  You can see the tension between Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell in a few episodes.  It was obvious that they were trying to keep Martin and Tisha from having any physical contact with one another in the last episodes of the season.  She was even written out of several episodes because of the problems they had. I bought the last season just so I could complete the set.  I love Martin Lawrence's work.,1231632000,8,519,4.421052631578948
3445103,3,B0019ZYD0I,"I can't say this was a horrible season.  I could say that it was not great.  The fact that the trouble behind the scenes mired the full effect of this season is key to this review.

It's just sad the show ended the way it did, maybe they will have a reunion show we can hope for the best.",1230076800,3,323,3.764705882352941
3445106,4,B0019ZYD0I,"I'm pretty appalled that anyone would fault Ticha Campbell for leaving the show. If Martin was sexually harassing her, she had every right to go. Of course, I was saddened to see her go and the way that season 5 suffered without her but no woman should have to endure unwanted advances by a man- especially at her work place. Anyway, despite losing Gina for the majority of the season, all of the episodes are hilarious and highly creative. And I give the woman her props for participating in the final episode.",1229904000,2,511,4.565217391304348
3445107,4,B0019ZYD0I,"This season was ok, I really loved season 1 thru 3 becasuse I think shawnene was a hit on the program, now if I knew that shawnene wasn't in this season I wouldn't bought it.",1225843200,,174,4.0
3445108,4,B0019ZYD0I,"This is actually a pretty solid season considering the controversy and the so-called sexual harrassment that Tisha filed, supposedly. I watched that second episode of this season and it didn't look like she had such a problem with it, hair all messed up and whatnot. Besides, she was in more episodes; actually half the season she was in more episodes so I don't know how credible her story is.
This season could've been way worse without her but after all, it is Martin Lawrence's show and he held it up on his own with the supporting cast. Everybody else in the principal cast got more room to breath and shine. It would've been nice to see more of his other characters, although the 2nd time that Sheneneh came up was in my one of my favorite episodes where she tries to sue Tommy as Mark Cooper as her lawyer. David Alan Grier came back. This season went off without a hitch.

But....

i could tell from the first episode that things were different, the energy was different, the chemistry was different and Martin was different. Then about the second disc in, he looked and acted a little too TOO serious with his facial expressions, there was almost a darkness to him or something. Some of the episodes and material was a bit too weak like the halloween episode with haunted house, the episode where the marriage license is wrong and the white girl episode. I could tell by the second disc that they were starting to run out of ideas but like i said it could've been worse and Martin held up pretty well. So it gets a solid four from me.",1225152000,26,1543,4.468085106382978
3445109,3,B0019ZYD0I,"Like a few others have stated before me, I'm only buying this to complete my collection.  The sad part is, I've been telling myself 'don't even bother!', but because I love Martin (and all the cast) so much, I have to complete the collection.  It saddens me to know that Martin and Gina had issues and ultimately, it destroyed the show.  I really wished they could've worked things out but, I understand that people have to do what they feel is best (whether it was Martin or Gina).  This season still had some funny episodes though and I'm looking forward to revisiting them.  Also, Pam did her best to carry the show from the female perspective, so kudos to her.  I believe that's why she's an addition to the cover and not one of Martin's alter ego's.  I personally feel they could have put a better picture of her on the cover!!!  Martin & Cast, if you're reading this, a comeback would be nice!  Hey, Cosby did it...lol.  You definately have an audience out there.  But if you decide to make a comeback, you betta come correct!!!  Miss you guys.",1223856000,12,1050,4.468421052631579
