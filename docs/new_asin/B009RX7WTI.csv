this is not the end, without a real ending. I don't like
having to use my own thoughts for an ending.
Thanks

5361561,5,B009RX7WTI,"Well, I do so love Grey's Anatomy.  I do not have any kind of TV programming, so I watch movies or DVD series like this.  It's great. I realize that some think of these serial programs as night time ""soaps"", but I don't view them as such.  I love the characters and the stories.",1361232000,3,278,4.111111111111111
5361562,5,B009RX7WTI,"I have purchased every season of Grey's and have watched every episode. While some are better than others, what series does not have it's up's and down. I know that some years, the series will end & I surely want to see the final episode when it comes. I consider Grey's Anatomy to be a cross between a medical drama and a soap opera - but I find it very entertaining to watch.",1360972800,31,377,4.178082191780822

5361564,5,B009RX7WTI,I had been ordering Grey's for my Son every Christmas because with work and family he was not able to watch week to week. Well this year I was informed that he really missed catching up on Grey's over the Christmas; New Years Holiday Break...OOPS I guess I missed # 7 & 8....OH MY !! Well that could explain why I had such a hard time figuring out what to get him....I guess I totally SPACED it. Well I have now ordered #7 & 8 (Happy Fathers Day and Birthday) And so I don't FORGET again I have pre ordered season #9.  Grey's just keeps getting better year after year !  Love it and now Pre Ordering will be a New Years tradition....One more gift out of the way! LOL,1357516800,,666,4.115384615384615

5361642,4,B009RX7WTI,"This season Mark Sloan and Lexie Die. The doctors involved in the plane crash pool their funds with the Harper Avery foundation (175M) and buy the hospital. They form a board of directors that is headed by relatively new doctor Jackson Avery.

Storylines:
Meredith discovers she is pregnant and has a baby boy. During the delivery she has to guide the new interns how to stop and repair her spleen. Eventually Bailey saves the day and the new baby is called Bailey.

Bailey marries Ben and Ben continues to live and intern in California. Also, Bailey has staph infection and kills 3 patients.

Karev is being difficult as usual and is in love with Joe Wilson; an intern who grew up in her car and foster care.

Arizona Robbins is upset that Torres ordered the removal of her leg and starts dating the new HOT doctor in town.

Torres is focused solely on having _______________ with Robbins and finding bones to grow and manipulate.

Derrick's hand is messed up and he can't perform surgery. THIS IS A REPEAT of the Preston Burke storyline. Eventually Derrick's hand is healed and he can perform surgeries again.

Brookes is Derrick's new favorite intern even though she is quirky odd and weird.

Jackson is having _____________ with the new intern STEPHANIE. Stephanie and Jackson have NO chemistry.

April falls in love with Matt, the medic, and he asks her to marry him. She says YES but is in love with Jackson.

Matt is a male medic who is a virgin.

The best storyline is when YANG went to Minnesota. She took a special interest in an older surgeon and he gave her the advice to be herself and don't let anyone make her feel like she has to be mediocre to fit in. After the surgeon dies, YANG returns to Seattle and resumes relations with Owen. She discovers that she is not enough for OWEN; he needs a child.

Owen decides to adopt a boy, but the boy's father awakes from his comma. Owen is trying to convince himself that his life will be okay without children.

This season was better than the last 4 seasons and the interns are better too. The attendings are now too old for this mess. It is time to make new stars for the show.

Especilaly annoying is Meredith's fat face and skinny body. Also, her lack of enthusiasm for acting is obvious. I wish we all could be paid MILLIONS to do a job we really don't have a strong interest in doing.

From the TV SHOW the PRACTICE: Rebecca makes an appearance as Meredith's OB.",1433635200,,2426,4.494305239179955
5361643,4,B009RX7WTI,"The DVD's themselves are wonderful and I would recommend this series to anyone.

However, the packaging on these is not great. All five discs are in the one case. This would normally not be a problem, except that the case is made very cheaply and could break in shipping.

5361791,5,B009RX7WTI,"I really enjoy this show a lot.  I enjoy show with that let you learn about the different characters and their lives, relationships and careers.  Grey's Anatomy is like that.  Yes, you do have the medical cases that they work on, but that is not the heart of the show.  It's their interaction with each other.",1379635200,,309,4.464285714285714

5361797,4,B009RX7WTI,"I was so happy when I was able to pick up the complete 9th season of Grey's Anatomy! This show is so awesome...I'm in love. However, the season dvds are all squished into a regular DVD case, unlike the past seasons that have come in a more elaborate packaging. Is everyone's copy like this, or did I just get lucky? haha",1377907200,,320,4.262295081967213

5361801,1,B009RX7WTI,"I stopped watching season 9 after the third episode. I am so upset with how they handled the plane crash and recovery. I don't know who was responsible for putting it together but I wish that I could tell them personally how much I hated it. Plain and simple I was cheated. I felt nothing, no connection, no closure and no drama. How could you do this to us, to your fans? What a terrible let down.",1376870400,4,398,4.181818181818182

5361803,5,B009RX7WTI,"This is probably the best entertaining and tragic series that I have ever had the pleasure to watch. In fact I don't watch it on television, I buy the series every year because I can't imagine watching this extraordinary show with moments so harsh and shocking only to be interrupted by commercials or wait for the next week or next season talk about shrinking the....drama. I can't, the shock value is so much more when it's not interrupted plus you get all kinds of fun information on the actors on the characters and not to mention the bloopers and I love How Meredith Grey-Ellen's Pompeo's laugh is so great I start laughing and it's the same laugh in the bloopers as it is in the series and of course how can one outdo McDreamy, McSteamy, McBitchy, and George's famous McVomit....I have bought every years' series, and I will continue until one day some fool cancels it. But I will always have it. How would you like having a person like Cristina Yang..and their guest stars: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Kyle Chandler, can you say a lot McYummies...but why of why must they always die...Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the dad in Supernatural ....and well let's not reveal anything for those Supernatural fans.... Love this show, the entire cast, and the genius who thought it up! There aren't enough stars in the sky to give to this super medical drama show. OOPs this is for series 1 to 8 I don't think nine is out yet? It won't matter because I will love it as much as loved each and every season. This is for all the seasons fans already know what happened from to 8 and I can't wait for season 9 (which I should have received by now) hint, hint",1371254400,12,1638,4.481605351170568

8543970,2,B009RX7WTI,This season of grey didn't make sense. Grey loss it touch. So many departues of over years. Season nine start to drown and got  a little borning. The one good thing was Mark Sloan death. He was so annoying. I am glad he was gone. Cristina and Owen break up and make up was getting a little stale and Derrick and Meredith was also. The sad death of of Adele ( Richard Webber wife was  so sad  I was crying for days. I love Ben and Baily relationship that was good it keeps me tuning in. I hate the character of Ross he was so annoy I had to fast forward his scenes and thoses new internet serve no interested.,1527638400,,608,4.05
