8364308,3,B002CMPCWK,"Since  there  are  no  reviews  on  this  one,  let  me  be  the  first  to  comment,  We  use  to  have  this  movie  a  long  time  ago.  Its  probably  not  the  most  popular  one.  When  it  was  directed  I  don't  think  they  made  more  than  25'000  dollars  when  it  was  released.
The  story  begins  with  a  young  teenage  girl  named  Stacy (Marta Kober) Who  seems  to  have  other  desires  besides  household  chores.  Her  stepmother  is  pregnant.  & needs  help,  so  when  Stacy's  father  (Geraldine Fitzgerald)  returns  home  he's  displeased  with  his  daughter.  So  they  have  an  argument.  &  Stacy  runs  away  not  more  than  20  to  30  miles  away  at  the  most,  &  spends  the  first  night  outside  listening  to  the  coyotes  howling.  Her  real  mother  is  deceased  &  was  living  in  Colorado.  But  she  wouldn't  believe  it,  not  until  the  end  of  the  show.
She  soon  meets  an  old  senior  aged  woman,  named  Ella. I  don't  know  Ella's  name  in  real  life,  but  what  I do  know  is  she  received  a  role  in  one  of  the  Poltergeist  movies  shortly  afterwards  as  the  kids  grandma.
Ella  takes  her  in  &  is  understanding.  &  in  the  meantime  Stacy  bonds  with  a  horse  named  Red.  She  helps  Ella  out  &  together  they  rebuild  a  corral,  Ella  talks  about  her  deceased  husband.  Stacy  does  have  a  bad  attitude  though,  first  off  when  Red  acts  strange,  Stacy  neglects  to  tell  Ella  about  Red  going  down.  Meanwhile  Stacy's  father  finding  out  where  she  is  wants  to  go  get  her,  but  the  stepmom  Barbara  insists  that  Stacy  needs  time  to  herself  &  that  she'll  come  in  on  her  own  when  she's  ready.
Later  Red  does  it  again,  &  Ella  says  I  believe  this  horse  is  sick.  When  the  veterinarian  came  out,  he  said  Red  has  got  something  called  the  swamp fever  &  would  need  to  be  shot.  I  think  that's  what  he  said.  Stacy  overhearing  the  news  runs  away  again,  This  time  taking  Red  with  her.  Not  understanding  the  situation. I  realize  what  she  was  going  through.  She'd  lost  her  mother,  &  didn't  get  along  very  well  with  her  father  &  stepmother.  Red  had  become  her  friend.  Ella  follows,  &  when  she  catches  up  her  &  Stacy  do  have  a  short  argument,  she  had  admitted I  won't  let  you  shoot  him,  &  Ella  was  getting  pretty  mad!  After  Red  got  shot  Stacy  loses  her  temper.
Then  after  they  raised  their  voices  at  each  other,  Ella  explained  things  to  Stacy  &  the  message  finally  gets  across  to  her.  She  learned  how  to  respect.  Stacy  had  learned  something!  This  movie  or  show  whatever  you  want  to  call  it,  is  one  of  the  shortest  movies  that  there  is.
I'll  admit  she's  not  the  first  to  have  trouble  with  friends  &  family.  The  important  thing  is  whether  or  not  you  talk  things  over  like  her  &  Ella  did!",1434499200,,3017,4.376050420168068
