5064266,5,B0079ILHV2,"While there are some gory scenes of operations, this show is smart, witty and  engaging. James Nesbitt is wonderful and believable in the role of Gabriel Monroe, a neurosurgeon and many of the other characters positively add to the show. Some of the personal relationships work better than others but overall I liked this so much I ordered the second season (also great).",1399420800,,371,4.888888888888889
5064267,4,B0079ILHV2,"Inevitably, the new British medical series MONROE will be compared to the American hit House. There, now that that is over with, MONROE can be discussed on its own merits and not on how well or poorly it compares to something else.

When the long-running police drama The Bill was cancelled from ITVs line-up in 2010, one of the programs proposed as a replacement was a medical drama focusing on one central character (unlike many other ensemble-type shows set in hospitals). Obviously any program that relies on the charisma of one central actor stands or falls on the merits of that artist. Fortunately for MONROE, James Nesbitt is the star in question.

For many North Americans, their first significant exposure to Nesbitts talents was in the excellent police drama Murphys Law, which began with a healthy dose of humour and ended on a very dark note five seasons later. Monroe is a much more stable character than Murphy, though he is also a man of extremes, brutally honest about both his genius-level surgical skills and his personal flaws. Nesbitt has an inherent charm that works heavily in his favour as an actor, allowing him to portray meanness, even occasional pettiness, while reassuring the audience that these actions are temporary, that underneath he is a decent, sensitive guy.

The initial series of MONROE (this DVD set) is comprised of six episodes. Much of the first episode is exposition, and we quickly learn that Monroe has a wife on the verge of leaving him and a son just starting university. Hes a ladies man, which forms the basis of his wifes distrust, loves to play poker with his colleagues, and has a family tragedy that, in part, drives him to do what he does.

Once the scenario is established, the plotting is allowed to take hold. While there are few surprises for anyone remotely familiar with medical dramas, its the reactions and responses of Monroe himself that really pique the viewers interest.

Of the supporting cast, there are no real stand-outs, but perhaps as the series grows (a second series has been commissioned) they will each have the chance to develop. Meantime, if youve ever wondered how hard it is for the actors in hospital dramas to spout technical terms, it isn't easy. There is a great example in one of the later episodes of having to rattle off difficult medical terminology. It comes from the supporting character of Mullery, played by the young actor Andrew Gower in his first professional role. This feat is truly impressive to hear. Flashes like this suggest that the supporting characters will shine, given the chance.

One final note: even with Nesbitt at the helm, the character of Monroe has to be someone about whom we care. After the first five episodes his Irish wise-cracking charm was beginning to wear a bit thin. But towards the end of episode six, Monroe really let his guard down in one scene with his estranged wife. With a talent like Nesbitt, its a moment that makes the entire series worth it. Its a pertinent and timely reminder of Nesbitts brilliance as an actor, as well as an overdue glimpse into the inner life of Dr. Gabriel Monroe, beneath the veneer. MONROE isn't great hospital dramayetbut it is developing into an outstanding character study. Fans of James Nesbitt won't be disappointed.",1397433600,,3282,4.841354723707665
5064268,4,B0079ILHV2,There was a second season shown in the UK with six more episodes.  Hope it is released on DVD in the US.,1394409600,,104,3.727272727272727
5064269,3,B0079ILHV2,"This series can't seem to figure out whether it wants to be serious or a dramedy or some type of medical soap opera; whatever it is, I don't like it and won't be viewing any other episodes. The background music is incredibly distracting and just plain unpleasant. James Nesbitt is a fine actor, but he can't even bring this series up to speed. As for the comparisons to Hugh Laurie's, ""House,"" there is no comparison.  For once the American TV show, ""House,"" is far better than ""Monroe."" I think the only reason this series is selling at all is because of Nesbitt's popularity. It's no wonder it was canceled. As for it trying to fill in the gap left when ""The Bill"" went off the air, well, this is a very sad attempt at a replacement.  I hope that when James Nesbitt finishes the current and upcoming Hobbit films, he will find a much stronger series than ""Monroe"" to showcase his considerable talents.",1358553600,,903,4.533742331288344
5064270,4,B0079ILHV2,"We're both avid fans of James Nesbitt but this series just didn't do it for us. Murphy's Law, is our all time favorite of his works that we've seen.",1351728000,,148,4.137931034482759

5064272,5,B0079ILHV2,"I went into 'Monroe' knowing only two (2) things: the first was that it was a British TV show of six (6) episodes set in a hospital, and secondly that it starred the brilliant James Nesbitt ('Murphy's Law'). But, after just ONE episode, what I quickly learnt was that 'Monroe' is easily the best TV show I have watched - either side of the Pond - in the past DECADE!

Honestly, it has everything a compelling TV show should and still manages to maintain a healthy balance between medical proceedures, sarcasam, tense moments, supposed lost causes, jokes, and even romance! It drives at the heart of brain surgery and heart proceedures full on, graphically most times (so beware if you intend on eating whilst this show is on!), and yet mixes personal lives, reality-based-problems, and sexual tension with equal bouts of intrigue.

Coming across as a lighter-hearted version of an overly-dark, depressing 'House,' this UK show chock full of high-risk medical emergencies - usually two an episode, one for Monroe re: brain and one for the heart surgeon Dr. Jenny Bremner (Sarah Parish - 'The Pillars of the Earth') - is fast-paced, slick, spot on with regard the feelings shown by all patients concerned, and never once tries to be something it's not ie: 'House'!

In the opening episode, we learn that Monroe (Nesbitt) lost his own teenage daughter to a brain surgery a few years back, and that once his teenage son finally leaves the house for University, that his wife follows suit - given that Monroe had had an affair around the time of their daughters death. All this and Monroe still manages to perform his medical duties to 100% perfection.

In 'Monroe,' as the cases are brought to the surgeon's attention we the audience get a quick flashback sequence of how it all came to be the for patient. Also, whereever the people are in the hospital, a quick flash of some hospital informational mile marker is shown to us to bring us up to speed. Also, unlike 'House,' this show was actually filmed in a real, old building, which makes it all seem and feel so much more real, so much more believeable. Indeed, the production was based in the old Leeds Girls' High School in Headingley!

And so through the episodes, as noted above, we get a brain surgery case each time along with a heart proceedure. Or, in the case of the fifth episode, one of each on the same woman - hours apart - and actually one of Monroe's more aspiring interns! We also have a heart-wrenching heart proceedure on an old lady that doesn't end as well for all concerned, and in-house affairs that you can say the very same thing about!

Monroe is a gambler - poker and the horses - has a fling with a foreign coffee server at the hospital, has to rebuild his relationship with his son after the break-up of his marriage; and try and become civil with his wife for the son's sake! Oh, and doesn't seem to get any sleep at all! Throughout the entire first season, anything that can go personally wrong does, but at the same time the balance is perfect that anything that can go right (on the operating tables), for the most part, does.

In the final episode, the sixth, Monroe's house is empty, he is spending more time in his daughter's left-as-it-was bedroom, and his best (only) mate Shepherd (Tom Riley) is talking of leaving the hospital. Add to that a case that comes in on a 13 year-old girl caught up in a car accident that leaves her, basically, dead, it all comes full circle for Monroe. This episode WILL bring tears to your eyes, be forewarned!

And luckily for me, and all those others that WILL fall in love with the show, as the show broadcast on ITV (UK) to strong ratings a second series was commissioned in July 2011 and will begin production this year! Yay!!

5064273,5,B0079ILHV2,"Dr. Gabriel Monroe (James Nesbitt) is a neurosurgical doctor who is as arrogant as you might expect holding such a position. He is excellent at his job and as you might expect, much less successful on the home front.  He has a falling apart marriage teetering on divorce, with the wife separated, and a very up and down relationship with his teenager.  Trying to find someone new, it goes well at first for him but then flounders over the same issues.  Whereas he flounders on the personal front, he brilliantly succeeds in the operating room. Naturally he has other doctors under him and another surgeon with whom he battles constantly.  This all makes for a very good show.

I have watched all seasons of HOUSE MD yet find it hard to compare the two shows.  One big difference is that this character is a surgeon in the UK whereas House is an internist in America.  This makes for bigger differences than one might at first think. An internist is centered on diagnosis whereas a surgeon is centered on going in and cutting out the killing element. And Monroe is centered on cutting open the brain. So their cases are very different as are their jobs. Monroe is also not as cynical and jaded as House plus wouldn't dream of taking addictive drugs as they might interfere with his surgical performance. So it is best to take this show on its own merits, which are considerable.

5064274,5,B0079ILHV2,"Blunt Dr. Monroe (James Nesbitt, Murphy's Law) neurosurgeon heavy on brain, smarty humor, who cares for patients almost as much as he does for himself. But he's nasty to colleagues. He reminds me of Doc Martin clashing ways, mind of his own, but thrives on blood, unlike Doc Martin (Martin Clunes). That's a must view renewed series. Monroe is good too, expect a long run. Hospital staff wither when facing Monroe. Problems for him at home too. Home and work families are not Monroe's strong points. Dark humor, medical drama, even goose bumps along with IVs. Regular cast: Sarah Parish (The Pillars of the Earth) as Jenny; Susan Lynch (Elizabeth: the Golden Age) as Anna Monroe, Anesthesiologist Shepherd (Tom Riley).

8512683,5,B0079ILHV2,"'Monroe' is no 'House.' Which is fine. If anything, the swagger of Dr. House, the arrogance, and above all, the horrible hospital atmosphere of the 'House' series should not be a model for series like this. I recall the dress and demeanor of Lisa Edelstein's character Dr. Cuddy as being so unprofessional for a woman in a position of leadership. Recently, I notice this trend more and more - but Dr. Cuddy was impressive in that regard. If you have seen the legal drama 'Rake,' an Australian television series, and the adaptation to the American TV screen, 'Rake' starring Greg Kinnear, you will notice how a female character translates to the American city by having her neckline plunge, her boobs bobble up, and her hair become a glorious blown-out cloud. All the more to distract from the presence of any intelligence, my dear!

I like James Nesbitt. He is kinder here than he appeared in ""Stan Lee's Lucky Man.' His character, like that of Cleaver in 'Rake,' has failures in his personal life. This makes for interesting plots and subplots. All the better for the viewer, who is entertained. Too much of this without heart and you simply don't like the character. A challenge for the writers of 'Monroe.'",1529884800,,1209,4.784688995215311

8512689,5,B0079ILHV2,"This is easily one of the best shows from the UK.

You may or may not have noticed, but many UK shows do not have much of a budget and it shows.  This is one of the more visually stunning shows (but in a subtle way), where the sets seem absolutely real and the procedures genuine.

All of the characters are interesting, even if they do not seem 3-dimensional at first.  I could be wrong, but I believe a very basic description of each character was determined at first, but the actors and writers fleshed in the characters quite marvelously (which character development takes place over time as you get to know the characters).  For the most part, a medical drama is a medical drama; so it is the writing and the characters which draw you in (unless you just happen to like hospitals and medical procedures).

I think I have seen comparisons drawn to ""House.""  Monroe and House have very different personalities and they deal with a completely different medical context.  About the only similarity is, both men have a healthy ego.  If you let House be House and Monroe be Monroe, without thinking that you need to make some kind of comparison, you can enjoy both shows.  I see them as being equivalent in quality.

There is very little by way of bad language, apart from an occasional ""s***e.""  There are several irreverent references to God and to Jesus Christ (not a constant barrage as we might see in a Showtime series; nor is this the language of every character); and there are, from time to time, reasonable acknowledgements of God or a Higher Power.

There are adult situations, but no nudity.  Sexual scenes are alluded to, but not filmed (to the best of my recollection).  Personally, I could see sharing this show with a kid in his late teens.  Use your own best judgement with younger children (you can certainly preview the show and enjoy it a second time--I am on my second viewing in less than two years).

Great musical theme and sometimes brilliant music throughout.

This is easily one of England's best produced shows with real talent being found at all levels.

The biggest negative is, this show only ran for two seasons (and I believe the second season requires you to have a region-free dvd player).  After seeing the 1st season, you may find yourself buying a region free DVD player in order to see series 2.",1471046400,,2333,4.602905569007264

The writing is poor and despite the many possibilities surrounding a hospital, the stories are rather boring.  Anyone who knows anything about the British Health Service (NHS) will find the irate patients and their amazing abilities to hear private conversations, beyond belief!
