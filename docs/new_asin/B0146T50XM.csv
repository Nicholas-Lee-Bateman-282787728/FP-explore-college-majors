7385195,3,B0146T50XM,"The point of this National Geographic film is the people who live in Jerusalem - Christians , Jews and  Muslims - as seen through the eyes of three young girls (who look so much alike they could be sisters). These girls all love Jerusalem because it is so meaningful for them - family history, religious significance, etc. It is a lesson in tolerance because all three of them could be best friends, except that they seem not to be allowed to know one another. As for the city, blink and you miss the scenery - oops, there went the garden of Gethsemane - oh,  you missed it . So, if your plan is to wander through the streets of the old town, it is so crowded that you can't see anything most of the time. People everywhere. If I wanted that I could go there myself. The only new information for me is about the Jebusites who were the first people to live there thousands of years ago - oh, gee, a factoid - I would be interested to know more about them. To be fair, the scenes inside the dome of the rock were interesting, because very few documentaries have had a chance to go inside - hence the three stars. BTW, f you are buying this to hear the omnipresent Benedict Cumberbatch (oh, there he is in Sherlock, Star Trek, Smaug, Turing, Penguins?!), he does very little narrating and probably wrapped  the whole thing in five minutes, so no joy there as the Brits would say. I was disappointed but you may love it.",1451779200,2,1416,4.315789473684211

7385199,5,B0146T50XM,5 star to counteract the 4 star reviews I saw  Great est movie ever see the south park show about yelpers? same principle applies,1449014400,2,129,4.375
7385200,4,B0146T50XM,"This 45-minute film (which has been showing for a few years in IMAX theaters) is valuable for at least four reasons:
1. It has beautiful images.
2. It has breathtaking cinematography.
3. It accurately informs you about history and geography, which helps you better understand the Bible's historical-cultural context.
4. It shows why modern-day Jerusalem desperately needs the gospel. (I'm a conservative, confessional evangelical.)

FYI:
1. National Geographic is not exactly a conservative evangelical organization, so it's not surprising that the film's perspective on religion is sociological, not theological. The film concludes that while Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have distinct customs and traditions, they are not so different after all.
2. The versions of Christianity that the film displays are Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, not evangelical Christianity.

This is a film worth owning.

7385201,5,B0146T50XM,"I saw this film in IMAX and it was great. It was just like bring in Israel, but without the travel and cost.

I saw this movie originally in IMAX at a science museum. I then arranged a special showing for our church youth group at another museum closer to home. We invited another youth group to join us. Everyone LOVED it! Definitely started many great conversations and helped our youth understand the beauty and struggle in this amazing city.",1515196800,,600,4.882352941176471
7385208,2,B0146T50XM,"Fantastic filming and narration.  The content is total empty of value.  You can be anything you want to be religiously but don't take it to seriously.  Is that what you believe Israel's culture is?  That makes the film shallow and empty of cultural perspective.  Typical of Western Culture and National Geographic.  Enjoy the film for its cinematography and narration.  National Geographic has a habit of evaluating culture through their own ignorance of it.  If you want to see it watch it on YouTube for free it's cheaper and you won't waste your money.  The perspective of the U.S. tourist is to ignore what you should be learning of culture through isolation and 'group think'.  There is more to life than fine hotels, cuisine, and group tours with your fellow 'think alike'.  I will not travel with the U.S. tourist.  I want to learn more from the experience than just the expected.  Believe me I have had enough experience with tourists to know just what I am talking about.  I would visit Israel to experience the history, culture, and beauty of the very ground Jesus Christ walked on, not hear someone's vacuous interpretation of.",1513209600,,1138,4.829015544041451

Will they ever cross paths and what is the difference between their experiences being that they are of different religious faiths?

The photography itself is amazing and inspirational. You will be impressed with the beauty of Jerusalem. If you can't visit, then this is the next best thing.

7385223,5,B0146T50XM,"I wouldn't have known about this movie but for an ad I saw that it was playing at the IMAX theater in my home town. The hitch is that my home town is 6 hours from where I live now and there is no chance I could see this in a local theater. So I was happy to find that it was available on Blu-Ray/DVD.  I know the experience watching on my home TV vs seeing it in a real IMAX theater is night and day but I was motivated enough to buy it anyway.

The disc's image quality is superb, sharp with saturated colors and pristine full-dimensional surround sound. Both the image quality and audio quality rank among the best DVDs I've purchased.

The content is excellent as well. No touristy cheesy travel bait like some TV shows and also none of the dry geography lectures like some documentaries, the program manages to educate, entertain and wow at the same time.

Did I say it wows?  That is one of the things that makes IMAX movies so unique, their camera immerses the viewer in the middle of the action, pulls you by the hand right into the scene, and sometimes dazzles with sheer stunning photography.  Though only 43 minutes long it packs a lot of visual eye candy and fascinating facts in but never feels rushed.

3D REVIEW

3D never really took off in TV's, which is a shame, and the manufactures recently stopped making the hardware. While not every show is 3D worthy there are some, like this one, that make me happy my equipment has that option. Keep in mind that the 3D version has three viewing options ... Blu-Ray on one disc, standard def DVD on a separate disc and 3D encoded on the Blu-Ray disc ONLY if you have a compatible 3D Blu-Ray DVD player, a compatible 3D TV and compatible 3D glasses. If you have a compatible playback setup the 3D quality of this disc is very good but its not the kind of 3D effect that will make you jump out of your seat like in Avatar. The 3D effect is used sparingly and a couple of times they use it for some throwaway shots. But when it is good it is very, very good.

If you are buying this movie for educational content you might have to watch it a couple of times because they transition so abruptly between the various religions who lay historic claim to Jerusalem and some of imagery may look similar if you are not a student of those religions, sometimes the differences tend to run together. Maybe that is by design?

The screenshots are from the movie's internet site where there is a wealth of background information, behind-the-scenes clips including VR, 3D and hi-res photos.",1491091200,9,2531,4.388888888888889

I don't normally write bad reviews but if you're looking a sweeping panoramic view of Jerusalem painstakingly shot over years of work this is most certainly NOT it. Simply put this is a documentary about three girls - Christian, Jewish, Muslim. With a little bit of scenery thrown in. I'm very glad I didn't see it in Imax.

This film is more of a substitution, an effort to cover this niche in the documentary field, but in a much updated way. This plays exactly like an IMAX documentary usually does: heavy on the visual, with information scattered lightly throughout, like a dusting of powdered sugar.
For instance, the orignal documentary explained at great length the ceremony of the Great Vigil, while this one merely mentions it.
I found the device of using the three teenagers from each of the three faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) really annoying, as they seem like actors, and not very good ones, rather than real people interviewed for this film.",1458172800,9,813,5.029629629629629

It ended up disappointing. It mostly ended up being about three young women - Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. So the title is somewhat misleading. There is relatively little archeology. Despite a few stunning aerial shots, the film is mostly not about the city, but about the three young women and their activities. Overall, there is less content or information that I would have expected. It seemed a bit superficial.

If the three women had served as a vehicle for a good documentary, that could have worked. But it does not work. Each woman is very nice and beautiful. But they seemed rather naive, given the reality of conflict between the faiths. We already know that different faiths live close to each other. But the reality, never expressed in the documentary, is that each woman has a strong, incompatible belief in their own religion. The three women never even meet. It's like ""Everything is OK because these beautiful women from different faiths live in the same city"". That is not reality. So the film paints a misleading social portrait, while failing to cover many topics one would expect from a film entitled ""Jerusalem"".

On the plus side, the photography is stunning, and at least the movie is relatively short.",1525824000,,1354,4.982300884955753
