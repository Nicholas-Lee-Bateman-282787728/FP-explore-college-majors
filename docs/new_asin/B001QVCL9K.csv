8336517,1,B001QVCL9K,This is a bust! Low budget and the information is so general that there is nothing special or inspiring here.  The film is even out of focus.  You would do better on getting a book from ebay on entreprenuership.  Don't waste  your time on this low budget disaster.,1365897600,,264,4.4375
8336518,1,B001QVCL9K,A total waste of money. I could not get the video to play on my computer.  I'm not sure why.  I also could not download it to anything other than my Kindle.  Waste of time and money.,1361318400,,182,3.864864864864865

8336520,5,B001QVCL9K,The Work Your Way Up documentary on  entrepreneurship is simply perfect. As a college business student and future entrepreneur I found this film to be both educational and uplifting. Many astute business men with incredible real life experience give amazing insight to the world few have experienced. The academic side of entrepreneurship is also expressed from credible business professors at Bryant University. If you are the least interested in entrepreneurship or general business I say this film is a must see. You will learn from some of the best on how to make your ideas become reality. I gave this documentary five stars and I suggest you watch it and see why.,1248912000,,669,4.973214285714286

For those of you who are ambitious and have high goals in life, this is a film that will give you the perspective you need to set yourself off on the right foot. I'm an entrepreneur myself and one of the biggest things that helped me take the initiative to start DOing was acquiring a strong sense of preparation, confidence and belief in myself. It's having the right state of mind and perspective that gets you on your way. Once you're on your way, you won't look back. This is what the film does for you. It pushes you, it strengthens you.
20 bucks is trivial, if you're planning to create great things and hopefully make millions. Good Luck to you All and may we meet down the road.",1240963200,,791,4.351351351351352
8336522,5,B001QVCL9K,"Patrick Sargent is an enterprising young undergraduate business student who has produced an informative film about entrepreneurship.  The film offers a wonderful balance of education and inspiration.  On the one hand, it informs us regarding the keys to success for entrepreneurs.  On the other hand, it clearly inspires us to take risks, put aside our fear of failure, and consider pursuing an entrepreneurial venture of one kind or another.

The film is well-suited both for aspiring entrepreneurs as well as for educators who are teaching entrepreneurship at the college level.  I believe that it makes a nice complement to textbooks, case studies, and other forms of instruction.

For the aspiring entrepreneurs, the film introduces them to some interesting people who have launched businesses successfully.  They hear directly from these company founders, who talk about their successes and failures, and who describe the key lessons that they have learned.

I am proud to have been asked to be a part of this film, and I think it's a terrific achievement by Patrick Sargent.",1240876800,,1080,5.238372093023256
