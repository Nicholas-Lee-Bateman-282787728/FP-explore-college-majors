Andrews is the hottest hack in the outfit. Price is the ambitious new boy - inheritor of his late father's media empire - who offers a shiny new position to the man who can track down the insane killer (Barrymore) who's terrorising the city. Lang, the master of this kind of material, crafts a gripping, fast-moving neo-noir - one of the best films of his late period.

Friedlob (Producer),  Charles Einstein (Book Author), Casey Robinson (Screenwriter), Ernest Laszlo (Cinematographer), Guffroy Gilbert (Songwriter), Herschel Burke Gilbert (Composer (Music Score), Joseph Mullendore (Songwriter), Gene Fowler, Jr. (Editor), Carroll Clark (Art Director), Jack Mills (Set Designer), Norma  (Costume Designer), Jack Solomon  (Sound/Sound Designer), Gus Norin  (Makeup), Ronnie R.

Burt Kaufman), James Craig  (Harry Kritzer), John Drew Barrymore  (Robert Manners), Robert Warwick  (Amos Kyne) - - - - - Film noir has sources not only in cinema but other artistic mediums as well...the low-key lighting schemes commonly linked with the classic mode are in the tradition of chiaroscuro and tenebrism, techniques using high contrasts of light and dark developed by 15th- and 16th-century painters associated with Mannerism and the Baroque...film noir's aesthetics are deeply influenced by German Expressionism, a cinematic movement of the 1910s and 1920s closely related to contemporaneous developments in theater, photography, painting, scultpture, and architecture...opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and, later, the threat of growing Nazi power led to the emigration of many important film artists working in Germany who had either been directly involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners...Directors such as Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, and Michael Curtiz brought dramatic lighting techniques and a psychologically expressive approach to mise-en-scne with them to Hollywood, where they would make some of the most famous of classic noirs. Lang's 1931 masterwork, the German M, is among the first major crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, one in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). M was also the occasion for the first star performance by Peter Lorre, who would go on to act in several formative American noirs of the classic era ... featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of almost forgotten film noir gems

4482222,5,B004VA0R7Q,"Great film noir. For the aficionados out there, be sure and see this one. Enjoy the provincial way they handle the subject matter. Was our society really like that in the 50's?  I guess the in your face sexuality of Miss Monroe had not yet saturated pop culture as of yet.",1467504000,3,272,4.333333333333333
4482223,4,B004VA0R7Q,"I've read quite a few books by John Douglas, and overall, I really like them.  He was supposedly an ""underling"" of Robert Ressler in the early days of profiling.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ressler died a few years ago, from what I understand, but he did leave us with at least one valuable bit of terminology:  the phrase ""serial killer.""

Since I like Mr. Douglas' books, I decided to give one from Mr. Ressler a try, so this week I just purchased ""Whoever Fights Monsters"" (WFM).  It's a very interesting read, so much so that I'd actually recommend it over what I've read from Mr. Douglas; as a matter of fact, I'm about one-third of the way through already, after only reading a bit the last couple of nights, and it is very entertaining.

But if you read WFM, you'll learn that Mr. Ressler interviewed William Heirens -- ""The Lipstick Killer"" (TLK) -- in prison, I believe back in the late 70s.  While the book is quite informative, it's actually quite humorous in many ways as well.  Mr. Ressler actually kick-started the program of interviewing serial killers in prison -- many people incorrectly think that Mr. Douglas started the program (I was one of those people) -- in a very covert fashion.  Mr. Ressler discusses how his strategy in the FBI was to ""ask for forgiveness, not permission,"" because most new ideas for programs are shot down immediately by FBI heads, and he knew that interviewing killers would not go over well by most uppers in the FBI.  After all, FBI agents are supposed to catch killers, not talk to them.

Well, Mr. Heirens didn't give up much information during those interviews to Mr. Ressler, since by that time TLK decided it was in his best interest to just deny his crimes altogether.  Not a bad strategy I suppose, if you think you can get a retrial.  But many people now believe that Mr. Heirens was railroaded and therefore innocent, while Mr. Ressler makes it clear that the evidence against TLK was pretty overwhelming.

But if you learn about TLK's crimes, and then watch this film, quite a bit of the story was changed.  I suppose that's OK, although I usually prefer movies about serial killers to be as accurate as possible.  ""The Deliberate Stranger"" is an example of a film, adapted from a very strong book about Ted Bundy, that was mostly true.  But here, I found the acting by the gentleman who plays the Heiren's character to be quite laughable, while the acting of the rest of the crew was quite strong, particularly if you consider the era.  But as other people have already mentioned in many of the reviews on this site, this film is really more about the newspaper and media business, and perhaps the games that go on behind the scenes, than about the killings.

I bought this film, mostly because it was only a one-day rental I believe, and I wasn't convinced that I would finish it in one day.  I can get a little distracted while watching films I'll admit, as I like to hit the pause button pretty often, head for the kitchen, and make tea, as an example.  But since I bought ""While the City Sleeps,"" I can now watch it again and again, if I want.  And I know that I'll watch it at least one more time.

And why?

Well, this film is about 60 years old now, and as you probably already know, screenwriters in the ""olden days"" liked to write dialog that included ""verbal jousting,"" for a lack of a better phrase.  It probably is true that people, in particular men and women, interface differently over time, and so I will admit, some of the relationships and ""sexual politics"" were lost on me during the first viewing.  I'm sure that, on the second viewing, I'll be able to more easily understand those relationships, and the overall film will make a little more sense.

Well, if you're into true-crime, and you really want to see the dastardly deeds of a serial killer, this film may not be for you.  But it is surprisingly funny at times, and without watching it a second time yet, I'm guessing that it will be worth a second peek.",1463961600,2,3984,4.542016806722689

4482232,4,B004VA0R7Q,"This review is from: While the City Sleeps (1956) [DVD] (DVD)

While the City Sleeps (1956) was Lang's penultimate American film. A close partner of the same year's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, the two urban thrillers made up a double deal struck between Lang and producer Bert E. Friedlob for RKO, a studio soon to be disbanded. The two pictures share similarities in story (both are investigations of a kind), main character (Dana Andrews playing predatory males) and general mise-en-scene. The look of While the City Sleeps in particular, is very bright, forward and with an almost complete absence of noir lighting which (for me) disqualifies it from being a film noir. In fact the very flat, simple framing of each image is a far cry from what is considered Lang's trademark chiaroscuro style and it might be tempting to say on first view that the film looks anonymous. Watch carefully however and we find this apparent simplicity deceiving.

While the City Sleeps sets itself up as a serial killer picture which puts it in the same area as Lang's most accomplished masterpiece, M (1931). However, the pre-credit sequence which introduces Robert Manners (John Drew Barrymore) closing in on one of his victims, proves to be a McGuffin. The film's real subject is a three-way power struggle for control of a media corporation. Media magnet Amos Kyne (Robert Warwick) passes away, leaving his lazy son Walter (Vincent Price) to pass on all responsibility of running the organization to the winner of a contest he sets up to find 'The Lipstick Killer'. The three contestants are Mark Loving (George Sanders) the wire service chief, Harry Kritzer (James Craig) the pictures chief, and Jon Day Griffith (Thomas Mitchell) editor in chief of The Sentinel, the Kyne Corporation's main newspaper. The plot is really about ruthless ambition and how all three use and abuse others to gain complete control. Loving uses gossip columnist Mildred Donner (Ida Lupino) as his eyes and ears while Kritzer beds Walter Kyne's wife, Dorothy (Rhonda Fleming) in order to gain leverage over the husband. Griffith relies on his friend, Ed Mobley (Andrews) who plays a high profile reporter who now fronts the organization on TV. Mobley is Old Man Kyne's surrogate son who he had wanted to take over the corporation, and who has valuable connections in the police department which he will use to give Griffith an advantage over his rivals. So much, so plot-heavy perhaps and admittedly there isn't much here to distinguish it from other '50s newspaper exposes. In fact compare it with Ace in the Hole (1951) or Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and it even feels somewhat inferior.

However, the film is well worth watching for Lang's telling visuals. The use of TV is important here. The bright, flat stagey claustrophobia of so much of the film gives it a 'made-for-TV' look. It's no coincidence that the stars in the film all had their own TV shows at the time and Lang plays on this. Dana Andrews gives an especially TV drama-like 'flat' performance which rather suits the brief. Lang sees TV as a threat, something that we watch, but also something that controls us. Two sequences stick out. The first has Old Man Kyne seemingly killed off by the TV. Mobley is alone with the bed-ridden Kyne and is in a hurry because of a news broadcast he has to give. Interrupting Kyne by turning off the TV he says 'sorry to cut you off' to which words the old man dies. Kyne is played by Robert Warwick, an actor who had been in movies as long as Lang himself and its obvious here that Lang is bewailing the change from cinema to TV, the TV news-anchor 'cutting off' the old style newspaperman. The second sequence has Mobley addressing Manners actually through the TV. Despite the fact they can't see each other, Mobley announces his engagement to Nancy Liggett (Sally Forrest) and provokes Manners (especially with his 'Mama's boy' taunt) into a rage which drives him to spy out Mobley's fiancee. Lang suggests here that TV is a threat because of its power of surveillance. This proves to be another key theme in the film's visual design. Everywhere is seen to be open to this surveillance. This is most obvious in the open plan design of the Kyne news office. Everyone is framed in their respective cage, but it is as if the sides of each cage are invisable. Everyone can see everyone which conversely drives everyone to communicate in hidden signals and even pantomime - Mobley calling Liggett to tell her to not let her boss (Loving) so near to her, and most clearly when Griffith prepares his extra edition, ordering his staff to keep calm and act like nothing's going on in order to fool Loving. Fear of surveillance is something that has haunted Lang's work from his silent days (those screens in Metropolis (1926)) right through to those multiple TV screens in Lang's last picture, The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). As much as we humans are individuals we are all somehow part of a bigger machine which is overseen by 'someone' somewhere. This paranoia cuts to the heart of Lang's universe.

The framing of people in a surveillance-driven society with the TV screen being a camera as much as anything else is subtlely reflected in the way Lang treats the actors. Most obvious is the way Manners has to get a picture of a woman in his head before he gets the sexual urge. Twice in the film he (and Lang's camera) frames victims in doorways before moving in for the kill. Lang's obsession with framing reached perfection in M and was developed further through Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945). In While the City Sleeps Manners is framed by Mobley talking to him through a TV screen (another frame!). Concurrant with this is Lang's own framing of both Manners and Mobley in which parallels between the two are underlined repeatedly. Mobley may be the most 'noble' of the media sharks (because he is a TV celebrity and therefore above the power struggle), but Lang presents him as a doppelganger for Manners nevertheless. Mobley leers at every pretty woman that passes, allows himself to be picked up by Mildred Donner and is even labeled as 'hung up on women' by his own girlfriend, Liggett. He lets himself in to Liggett's apartment by letting loose the door catch in the same way as Manners in the pre-credit sequence and the whole plot turns on his decision to use Liggett as bait to lure Manners out of his hiding place.

While the City Sleeps does have its limitations. The psychology of Manners is way too shallow for us to really believe in him. The black leather outfit seems to be a Marlon Brando Wild One hand-me-down which adds nothing to an under-written role which Barrymore can do nothing with. Too much of the film boils down to straight dialog between people we fundamentally dislike which in itself leads to ennui. Where Ace in the Hole has savage black humour to balance its barbed cynicism, While the City Sleeps takes itself far too seriously. There are also some unlikely lurches in the plot. Talking about Manners attacking Liggett in the daytime over a cup of coffee doesn't make it immediately so as the two leap up from the table and find themselves in pursuit of their man the very next second. Such artificial plot devices run unforgiven in most films I suppose, but not in the best Lang pictures. Finally, it's the film's cynical grayness which weighs against it. In M a whole city is traumatised by a serial killer. In While the City Sleeps, people just don't care. When Mobley chases Manners down the street, they brush past by-standers who aren't interested at all. The hunt for Manners is motivated by common greed for career advancement as well as the desire to sell papers through blatent sensationalism. In this brave new world regulated by TV, people are mere cogs in a bigger machine which controls them. Gone is any ability to think or feel themselves beyond their own selfish interests. Such misanthropy makes the film ultimately a dour watch, but Lang's acute visual sense does stop us from turning off. Exposure Cinema's DVD quality is excellent in terms of sharpness and sound. Not many extras, but at this price it's a sure recommendation.",1411430400,6,8181,4.770642201834862

4482237,2,B004VA0R7Q,"Boasting a cast that is slick and quite frankly extremely talented, `While the City Sleeps' looked, on the outset, to be a really great flick.  It was a film noir directed by the great Fritz Lang and with Oscar winners George Sanders and Thomas Mitchell starring alongside such notables as Dana Andrews, Ida Lupino and Vincent Price, I was hooked.  Sadly, the film never really makes much of the promise.  It plays out like `The Front Page' with a serial killer and it never really makes any of it remotely interesting.  With a sub-plot involving an adulterous trophy wife and a horribly clichd portrayal of a killer, `While the City Sleeps' nearly put me to sleep, to be honest.  None of the actors are putting their best foot forward, with Andrews (who was so marvelous in `The Best Years of Our Lives' and `The Ox-Bow Incident') is a bore of a protagonist, and while both George Sanders and Vincent Price carry an intruiging arrogance, they never really make real characters out of these men.  Ida Lupino is sultry eye-candy, and escapes the film unscathed, but she can't really make this film worth watching.  The score is rather good, especially the opening jazzy number, but the intensity is lost in every frame and even the full-fledged attack scene at the end doesn't feel intense enough.  The film should have been tighter, cut out the stuff that didn't matter and really focused on the meat of the film instead of trying to give us a bunch of sub-plots that no one cares about.  At the end of the day, this film feels too light for its own good.",1381708800,3,1555,4.605072463768116
4482238,4,B004VA0R7Q,"""While The City Sleeps"" is a late period film noir directed by Fritz Lang with a large roster of well known actors that displays how Lang's style had become very refined by the time of this film. Unlike many film noirs previously done, this one has quite the pedigree of actors that include Dana Andrews, Rhonda Fleming, George Sanders, Howard Duff, Vincent Price, Thomas Mitchell, Ida Lupino, James Craig, Sally Forest, and John Barrymore, Jr. Barrymore, is the son of the great actor John, as well as the father of Drew Barrymore. He plays the ""lipstick killer"" who is responsible for a series of brutal murders of women within New York City. The film is a multifaceted drama, in which two equally interesting threads-the lipstick killings and the competition for the New York Sentinel's editorship-are very well woven together. This is because Walter Kyne, Jr., played by Vincent Price, announces a competition among his staff which rewards the one who unmasks the will be named the paper's new editor-in chief. The well-seasoned cast do an excellent job, especially Dana Andrews, who plays prize-winning reporter turned television commentator Edward Mobley, and Thomas Mitchell, who plays fellow reporter and competitor, John Day Griffith. Both Ida Lupino and George Sanders are also excellent. The film's tone is very cynical, as would be expected in the world of film noir. There is an unusual reversal, in which the killer, who is portrayed as a ""momma's boy"", can actually be seen as more sympathetic than the newspaper's staff, who will do anything to get ahead and capture the prize offered. Actually, the fact that three men in the film would willingly use their girlfriends as ""bait"" to capture the killer, certainly does not speak well of their own fundamental humanity. Lang displays how an effective film noir can be created without a great deal of stylistic traits, specifically mood lighting or odd camera angles which are usually connected with film noir. Director Lang remains subtly expressionistic in his use of dcor. I have always found the film to be a bit too ""talky"", but within the milieu of the newspaper's setting, the flow is quote natural. Yes, it is a stylistically understated noir, but the wheeling, dealing, and back-stabbing of the competing media players give it an effectively cynical tone, which fits right in with the noir features. The re-mastered dvd print is excellent, and the film is presented in widescreen, 16x9, 2:1 ratio. The running time is 99 minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!",1380844800,15,2528,5.05023923444976

4482240,3,B004VA0R7Q,"""While the city sleeps"" is a 1956 black and white crime drama from legendary director Fritz Lang, with a star studded cast of slightly over-the-hill (but nonetheless talented) actors.

Handsome Dana Andrews (1909-92) stars as a reporter. Andrews appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in ""The Westerner"" (1941), ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), ""Laura"" (1944), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946).

Vincent Price (1911-93) is the playboy heir of a media conglomerate, looking for someone to take over the business. We tend to think of him all the B horror movies he made in the 50s and 60s, especially the first 3D film ""House of Wax"" (1953) and the marvelous ""The Fly"" (1958). But Price was extremely versatile, and did comedies (e.g., ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" in 1948, Egghead on the TV series ""Batman""), period pieces (e.g., ""The Ten Commandments"" in 1956), and film noir (""Laura"" in 1944, ""The Long Night"" in 1947, ""His Kind of Woman"" in 1951).

Sexy Rhonda Fleming (1923) plays Price's cheatin' wife. She appeared in 40+ films in the 40s and 50s and was nicknamed ""The Queen of Technicolor"" for her flaming red hair in films like ""Serpent of the Nile"" (1953), ""Queen of Babylon"" (1955), and ""The Big Circus"" (1959).

Suave George Sanders (1906-72) plays one of three men being considered for the job of Managing Director of the conglomerate. Sanders appeared in hundreds of films, often as a villain. He's best remembered as film critic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"" (1950) for which he won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.

Thomas Mitchell (1892-1962) is another contender. Mitchell  is best remembered for his supporting roles as Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""GWTW"" (1939) and  Uncle Billy in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). Over a 38 year career he won an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony.

Ida Lupino (1918-95) plays a reporter. Lupino is perhaps best remembered for her Emmy nominated role in TV's ""Mr. Adams and Eve"" (1957-8) although she won the New York Film Critics award for ""The Hard Way"" (1943). In the 40s she was known as ""the poor man's Bette Davis"" and put in some gritty performances in films like ""High Sierra"" (1941) and ""The Hard Way"" (1943).

Howard Duff (1913-90) plays a detective. He's probably most famous for his TV series with wife Ida Lupino, ""Mr. Adams and Eve"" (1957-8). Though they are both in this film, they are never in any scenes together.

John Drew Barrymore (1932-2004) makes an embarrassing serial killer. He's probably best known as the son of legendary silent film star John ""The Profile"" Barrymore and the father of highly talented Drew Barrymore.

Director Fritz Lang (1890-1976) was called the ""Master of Darkness"" by the BFI. More than anyone else he is responsible for popularizing the German school of expressionist film, with the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), the revolutionary ""Metropolis"" (1927) and the frightening ""M"" (1931) which launched the career of Peter Lorre. Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled German in 1934 once the Nazis took over. He eventually came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), ""Western Union"" (1940), ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), and ""Clash by Night"" (1952). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Lang is at home with the story of a serial killer, a topic he explored in ""M"", and with the ambiguity of the lead characters. Yet he seems unable to stick to his story, moving back and forth between the serial killer angle, a Spencer Tracy newspaper yarn from the 40s, and a Peyton Place soap opera inside the conglomerate. He made only one more film in the US (also with Andrews) and then moved back to Europe.

Ernest Laszlo (1898-1984) provides great photography, although with Lang as a director, it's hard to know who is responsible. Laszlo was nominated for an Oscar 8 times and won for ""Ship of Fools"" (1965). His notable films include ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960), ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961), and ""Logan's Run"" (1976).

The NY Times called it ""another shiny, sometimes over-dramatic illustration of the movie-makers' love of the newspaper game... full of sound and fury, murder, sacred and profane love and a fair quota of intramural intrigue."" Variety said ""The old-fashioned 'stop the presses' newspaper yarn has been updated with intelligence and considerable authenticity, and further brightened with crisp dialog... Plot intricacies are deftly interwoven, with director Fritz Lang doing a topflight job of balancing the ingredients without dragging the pace.""

The film was made at a time that the US Senate was worried about the influence of comic books and producer Bert Friedlob (1906-56) allowed Senator Kefauver to see a preview version and suggest changes. Following this film, he and Lang and actor Andrews made ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"", and Friedlob died shortly thereafter.

Bottom line - not the best example of Fritz Lang nor any of the participants, but not a bad film nonetheless.",1340409600,5,5167,4.976798143851508
8443117,3,B004VA0R7Q,"Middling newspaper man's story with an edgy noir twist. This isn't a crime/thriller, but rather a story about the underhanded backstabbing machinations of a big city paper left to founder after the death of its founding father. Good solid performances from  Dana Andrews, Thomas Mitchell and George Sanders. Ida Lupino manages to make the most of a mostly thankless part. She could read the telephone directory and make it work. Great actress! Same cannot be said for John Drew Barrymore  - definitely not a chip off the old block. Warner Archive's transfer is first rate. Nothing to complain about here. But this isn't Fritz Lang's finest flick by a long shot.  Can we please get WAC to get serious about the genuine gems in its back catalog. If you needed a crime caper with guts to remaster, try Johnny Eager. If you wanted a tale of big biz politics, how about Executive Suite?  While the City Sleeps is passable entertainment. That's about the best that can be said of it!",1524614400,,977,4.729411764705882

8443119,1,B004VA0R7Q,"This may be the worst movie I've seen, although I think Dondi from 1958 still is in first place.  A terrible film, by Fritz Lang whose American films by and large are flat, it has no dramatic tone and silly cocktail party dialogue.  It's supposed to be a crime drama, but plays like an attempt at a parody of a crime drama.  The thematic continuity from scene to scene, and sometimes from line to line, is zero so the whole thing seems to be a series of disconnected singularities with empty dialogue, moral flaccidity, and no human tension.  The actors are trapped by the banalities that surround them, but a stentorian like Dana Andrews really needs good material to avoid being a complete ham.  Here he fails miserably.  If you buy this, and it isn't particularly cheap, you might have a party where you and your friends could point and laugh as you watched the movie.  But, it was so bad that I couldn't laugh at all.",1523404800,,921,4.479041916167665
8443120,4,B004VA0R7Q,"This and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, the other Fritz Lang film released concurrently with While the City Sleeps, basically looks about the same - lots of opticals that don't hold up well, but the production photography looks okay for the low budget of these two films.  They were both made in 1956 and came out within six months of each other.  The film itself is not one of my favorite Langs - it just doesn't quite hang together, despite a killer cast - can't do better than this cast, and Lang is always a director of interest, even when he's not at his peak.",1521936000,3,561,4.384615384615385
