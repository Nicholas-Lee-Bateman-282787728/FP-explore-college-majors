8495781,5,B006ADQ2NK,This is the sexiest drama I've ever seen. The lead characters  don't  need words  to tell us they are in love.  It's a  shame it's  just  a drama.,1361059200,4,146,4.0
8495782,5,B006ADQ2NK,"In this review I will not discuss or review the drama itself, but I will disscuss the quality of this particular box set.

This is the licensed Malay version. The box set was sealed in shrink wrap with the original stickers. It is in a tri-fold design with 5 discs in total. There are 20 episodes in all. You can choose between Korean and Taiwan Mandarin audio and Chinese, English, and Malay subtitles. Menu options are in English and are easy to navigate.

The Korean audio is clear with no timing errors or quality issues.

Since I do not speak Korean or Mandarin the quality of the English subs is of paramount importance.

I am very pleased to say that the English subs are clear, comprehensible, and readable. With the following caveats. The amount of time the subtitles stay on the screen is makes them difficult to read. Also, those with vision problems may find the font size too small.

All in all this is a very good product and an excellent drama.",1356739200,4,959,4.520231213872832
8495783,5,B006ADQ2NK,I started watching and got hooked on the story and the drama. I really enjoyed watching it so I bought the entire set and I was not disappointed.,1353888000,3,145,4.214285714285714
