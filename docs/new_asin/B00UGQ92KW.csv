8706451,5,B00UGQ92KW,"A captured German was being brought back for intelligence purposes. A cursory investigation of his briefcase showed the he possessed a bar of gold. This turns out to be part of a horde that is in a bank behind German lines. Knowing this, what would you do?

Clint Eastwood, you remember him as the Jet Squadron Leader in (Tarantula (1955) is now on foot in the military during WWII. He upon learning that there is a considerable amount of German gold in a bank, 30 miles into enemy territory, he decides to assemble a taskforce of loyal...Oops, greedy soldiers that are capable of recovering the gold before the town is taken by the allies. In the processes they encourage the allies to push harder and further, regardless of the odds.

Some of the key people are:
Of course Kelly the organizer and instigator, who is Clint Eastwood who played a lab technician in ""Revenge of the Creature"".
Telly Savalas is Big Joe. Much different than his character in ""John Goldfarb, Please Come Home"" (1965), where he was a Harem procurer that procured Shirley MacLaine.

One person that did not change is Carroll O'Connor as General Colt who was listening to the progress on the radio and thought that the expedition was an enthusiastic spearhead. He plays General Bolt in ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" (1966), who looks at aerial photographs and thinks that the troops are in hand to hand combat. (Bolt, Colt, it is still Carroll 0'Connor)

Last for best is Donald Sutherland as Odd Ball the unorthodox tank Commander. See him on the other side or serious side as Faber in Eye of the Needle (1981). Keeping the Faith:",1499904000,,1613,4.669014084507042
8706452,4,B00UGQ92KW,"Kelly plans a gold bullion bank robbery in the midst of WWII action. Comedy, drama, war film. Great plot, interesting characters, good acting. Lots of explosions, lots of action, lots of absurd situations, lots of entertainment. On the one hand this is an action-packed war drama, and on the other its a wacky comedy. Strange combination, but a great film. Lots of fun. [Did I really say that about a war film?] Regardless of your taste in films, youll enjoy this one.",1483574400,,468,4.719512195121951
