1903948,5,B0000A59ZL,"I am a second grade teacher and every year, I do a unit on community heroes.  This video is a perfect addition to my lesson.  It is divided into three sections (Policemen, Firemen and Emergency Workers,) which are 30  min. each. Each section teaches the kids about the importance of these jobs. They take you on tours of the facilities, provide you with real life examples of these jobs and even have history lessons about the very first policemen, firemen and emergency workers.  My students really enjoy watching this video.",1384041600,,526,4.811111111111111

1903950,5,B0000A59ZL,"My kid is really into construction trucks, fire trucks, and semis, so this video was right up his alley...nice and appropriate for children.",1256601600,,140,5.130434782608695
1903951,1,B0000A59ZL,"I bought this for my 3 year old son. He was not intersted in all the talking by ""Laurie Dash"". Too many jokes that aren't funny or related to the hero and not enough action to keep a young child interested. The ""There goes a...firefighter/hero/police officer...series is much better. There is a host but also lots of action to keep a young childs attention.",1090195200,6,357,4.59375

7996179,5,B0000A59ZL,"Watching this video with your child will give you unrealistic expectations of your local first responders.
Your child may begin to parrot this video, word for word, until it's burned into your mind.",1440115200,,198,5.03030303030303
7996180,3,B0000A59ZL,"I bought this for my 3 yr old son who loves all emergency crews and has quite a few different kinds of videos on them, but this is a little more geared for maybe 8-10 yr olds? I don't know, it's a little dated too, totally feels like I'm back in the early 90s, but that's okay, I didn't expect it not to be. It's a little shorter than I thought, but that's my fault, I didn't even read the run-time when I bought it. All-n-all, it's okay.",1434585600,,438,3.9886363636363638
7996181,4,B0000A59ZL,"Shipped faster than I expected!! It's a little mediocre, but my 3 yr old son LOVES it. He has many other firefighter videos and this one seemed kind of short (running time) compared to his others, but I couldn't argue with the price. Thanks!",1430956800,,241,4.5

7996184,5,B0000A59ZL,"Our 7 year old son really LOVED this one, he has always been fascinated with Police, Fire Dept, and EMS anyway. I am not sure if it has something to do with the fact that his dad is a Police Officer or not, but he loves it anyway.",1399852800,,230,3.8125
