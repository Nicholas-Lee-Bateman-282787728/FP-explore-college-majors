2045909,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Host of the video is Evan Magolin, local San Francisco Dance instructor.  His trademark is the ""Let's break it down"" phase that always follows each dance pattern demonstration.  This allows the view to check moves step by step.  Evan is entertaining and builds slowly.  The chapter listings allow the viewer to jump to a particular move. His explanations  are accompanied by a large screen view as well as a smaller picture that shows closeups of feet and sometimes hands.  This is a video for people who want to learn how dance - not a display of professional dance moves.",1121731200,5,573,4.737373737373737
2045910,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"If you're looking for a DVD that shows good basic moves, this is it!  It covers connection with your partner, how to move your hips and body, where to place your feet and then gives you a few basic moves that are useful.  It definitely doesn't go into as much depth as a lot of the DVD's on the market.  But it covers the basics VERY well.  IF you're looking for something flashy, though, this isn't it.  It is simple and to the point.  I would recommend learning basics from this DVD and then moving on to a second DVD from another collection.",1121126400,7,544,4.233009708737864
2045911,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I've taken group salsa lessons and I feel this DVD is just as good or even better. They get you ""up and dancing"" in a very short time. The instructor is great (he reminds me a little of Jim Carrey) and he does a good job of pointing out the ""little things"". I like the concept of teaching you patterns - as opposed to just teaching steps/turns and then you have to try to figure out how to put it all together. After seeing this DVD, I ordered the rest of the series through intermediate, volume 2.",1116201600,7,498,4.144329896907217
2045912,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I was highly recommended to buy this DVD by a friend who also owns one.  In fact, I thought this video was very helpful to me since I'm a little shy in the public (stage fright). But it helped me practice my steps at home before I took any actual salsa classes or dancing on the dance floor.  The instructor breaks down the beginning steps in details making it quite easy to do the beginning steps.  It is wonderful to be able to take classes or dance with others having some of the background introduced on this DVD. It gave me more confidence to dance in the clubs.  I especially liked the tips of what not to do by the instructor.  I thought it was quite entertaining.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning salsa.",1090195200,26,742,4.302158273381295
2045913,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I got this video because I've been wanting to salsa dance for awhile, but have always been intimidated by the scene and always shied away from the idea of being the klutzy beginner around people who already danced.  I was pleasantly surprised by the length of this video (and hour and a half long!) which is longer than any other i've looked at.  Let's just say the video gave me a great foundation and armed me with enough skill to finally go out- I've since started going to some of the clubs and love it!  I've even been asked who I've taken lessons with.  I credit the clear and complete teaching on the DVD.  It's also funny, and both the guy and girl instructors do a great job of explaining everything thoroughly.  I'm already improving, and I can't wait for  volume 2, which is supposed to come out soon?  Def. going to get it!  I think I'm going to send it to my sister, who's been wanting to learn too.",1083024000,12,912,4.317647058823529
2045914,5,B0001ZJQ6I,This is a GREAT dvd for beginners.  The key to learning any dance is learning the basics.  The instruction provided does a wonderful job of breaking down the basic steps of salsa and then adding just enough 'flavor' to keep you interested.,1082419200,5,239,4.666666666666667
2045915,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I have bought a few of these DVDs and I have to say that this is the best one I have seen so far. I really like the caption box that shows the foot maneuvers from a different angle in a picture-within-a-picture.
Things start nice and slow and the guy in the video is easy to follow. Also, I think he has a dance style that looks really good without trying to be unrealistically flashy for beginners. Its pretty much the way I want to look when I salsa dance. The woman has some great styling that my girlfriend really likes.
Also, it seems to have a lot more on it than some of the other DVDs.",1082246400,10,593,4.076923076923077

2045946,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"This company has sent me 2 jars of salsa (there may have been a bit of an Amazon shipping mistake), a how to Salsa Dance DVD and a bottle of Bloody Mary mix, all for free, for me to review. I think I'm in love.

The DVD is just volume 1 of a series. Right off the bat, they say the video goes slow and covers the fundamentals of salsa dancing. This includes timing and rhythm, basic steps, how to hold your partner, leading and following, and finally putting together some different patterns. The steps are easy to follow, and the instructors demonstrate every step and there is also a ""picture-in-picture"" where it shows a close up of their feet in the corner.

In addition to instruction, the DVD also include Club Etiquette and Salsa History which I think is cool.

This video would definitely be fun for a girls night or fun for couples to try out. It's VERY simple to follow and they give great instructions. Give it a try!",1426204800,,928,4.383720930232558
2045947,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"This is the first DVD in SalsaCrazy's progressive 3 DVD Beginner's Salsa Dance System, and SalsaCrazy's 5 DVD Progressive Salsa Dance Mastery System (both available on Amazon). This DVD starts from the very beginning, and lays the foundation for salsa dance to get you started simply and easily, step by step.

The instructors start out by explaining the basics of Salsa so that once you work into the actual dance movements, you have some idea of what Salsa actually is and where it fits in the dance spectrum. The instruction itself is very easy to follow, with both full-length and close-up shots of the dancers' feet, going at a very easy, step by step pace at first and gradually working up to tempo. There are a total of 35 scene selections depicting different steps, and patterns of the dance and make sure to stay through the credits!

I received received this product complimentary for review purposes.  Opinions are 100% my own.",1426204800,,938,4.813664596273292
2045954,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Ok, so Ive attempted salsa dancing with my girlfriend/now fiance on multiple occasions and I swear every one has been a complete disaster! We went to a salsa in the park where multiple so called professionals tried to help me learn how to salsa dance. They tried, but didn't succeed. I just could never get the step and never understood how to move my hips. I honestly thought there was no hope for me, but then I found SalsaCrazys Beginning Salsa Dance, Volume 1.

This dvd was exactly what I needed! Its perfect for beginners who have no clue as it breaks down every part of the dance and step. I loved the beginning how it taught the basic step and helped me understand the exact beat and when to actually move my feet. One, two, three, five, six, seven. Watch the dvd and youll understand. I think the part that was best though was understanding what to do with my hips. I had serious problems bouncing while I danced and didn't understand what it meant. This dvd showed me exactly which way my hips should move on each beat. PERFECT!!!

Just because this says beginnnig doesnt mean its over basic. It will take you days to go through the entire dvd and learn everything on it. I suggest taking it slow and learning each chapters lesson before moving on. It could take you a month to learn the whole thing as there are 35 chapters on the dvd. If you're looking for a great teaching aid to help you salsa, SalsaCrazy is the dvd for you!",1426204800,,1439,4.385767790262173
2045955,5,B0001ZJQ6I,It is a great place to start learning the basics and they have a whole series of DVDs to help teach you to salsa. I was very impressed with how much time they spent on each set of steps and going over things. They did a great job at breaking everything down to make it easy to follow (even with 2 kids running around and trying to help with each step lol) I would definitely recommend this DVD series to someone that wants to learn to salsa in the privacy of their own home and doesnt really want to pay for classes. Thank you SalsaCrazy for sending me your product to try out!,1426118400,,577,4.115044247787611
2045956,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Fun way to put a spring into your step.  This goes through the steps of Salsa from Basic to Intermediate.  It is perfect for those just learning Salsa or looking to move from basic to intermediate.  I like it for the sweat factor.  As you pick up the skills you can pick up the pace and really give yourself a work out.  This if a good way for couples to have fun together while working out and getting ready for the upcoming pool season.  My only complaint would be that they could have back light it more, but still a great instruction.",1425254400,,538,4.2254901960784315
2045957,3,B0001ZJQ6I,It's a bit slow for myself and my students. We're not real beginners. But probably great for the very beginner students.,1425254400,,120,4.761904761904762
2045958,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Do you have 2 left feet? Do you wish you could learn to dance like the people at salsa night? Do you want a fun ladies night activity? Would you like to do something new & kind of sexy with your significant other? Do you just want to get in better shape but don't like the same boring old options? If you can answer yes to even one of those, this is for you! This 1DVD starter lesson includes  Salsa Dancing.  It's awesome, and it's from the START. I was given this product to review simply in exchange for my honest & unbiased opinion. Now, my friends & family are the guinea pigs so you don't have to be!

  When the product arrives it looks like any other regular dvd. That's where we stop though. It is really a d video containing an entire dance lesson. On product test night I sat back where I could get a good view of the action as my friends took their perspective spots to dance. The DVD does really start you out at step one like you don't know the first thing about dance. That is a huge plus. Perhaps if you are anything but a novice this may be maddeningly slow but for those who are it is perfect. They walk you through & demonstrate very slowly & receptively enough for one to really see but without seeming like they are patronizing you. My friends danced through the whole DVD before everyone was tired. They really enjoyed it & are looking forward to doing it again. I can see it at least becoming a monthly ritual.",1424822400,,1433,4.2153284671532845
2045959,5,B0001ZJQ6I,We are taking live salsa lessons which are good but this tape really added another dimension to our dance!,1424217600,,106,4.631578947368421
2045960,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Ive always wanted to try Salsa dancing. True story. The problem is that Ive never been much of a dancer. Ive been the one to sit off in the corner with my drink in m hand and watch everyone else. And it never mattered how bad everyone else looks out on the dance floor(and trust me, most of you look pretty bad, especially when there is alcohol involved), I can never get up the nerve to join them. I always thought that maybe, just maybe, if I learn a specific type of dance then I would be more comfortable getting out there. And Salsa has always appealed to me. So when I found out that I had the opportunity to review an instructional video on salsa dancing I was pretty excited!

I received my free copy last week and first put it in the next day. My 5 year old daughter was with me and we tried it out together. She is in ballet and was excited to try something different. In hindsight I wish I wouldve taken a picture or a short video because Ive gotta say, she looked pretty darn cute wiggling her teeny hips. While the video won't be winning any awards for production value, it was pretty good. The instructors were very easy to follow. They explained the steps just a little at a time before moving on. I think the pace was just about right. There was plenty of time to practice and figure it out before moving on, without getting bored with it.

The price is right too. Right now it is on sale for only $14.95 on Amazon and if you have Amazon Prime you can have it shipped for free as well. If you are thinking about trying something new then I would recommend this one. Even my 5 year old could do it and, as I said, we had a lot of fun with it. I can even see turning it into a workout once I have all of the steps down. Now my only challenge is trying to get the hubs to try it with me so I have a dance partner thats closer to my own size.

I was given my copy for free in exchange for writing a review but all of my opinions are my own",1423440000,,1951,4.010282776349614

You must have a willing partner, willing to be lead that is as salsa is all about cuing your partner in on your intentions.

The couple in the video are obviously not dance professionals and are simply looking to rip people off by making a poor video with a beautiful cover picture. They didn't use their own pictures on the cover because they are two untalented people who are not professional dancers. Just a pair of business people who found a way to rip off consumers with good advertising and poor production. I wanted to return the video the moment I saw it but unfortunately, amazon doesn't allow returns on opened DVDs. It is now obvious to me why there is no trailer for the DVD. If I had seen a trailer I would have known how horrible the filming and instructional quality of the film was. Please save your money.",1360627200,7,821,4.591836734693878

2046099,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"Ok, a couple months ago, I decided to learn how to salsa dance.  I enrolled in group lessons that meet for an hour once a week, watched a bunch of youtube videos, bought this DVD and a learn to salsa app for my phone, and have been going out dancing when I can.  By itself, this DVD (along with a partner to practice with!) should barely be enough to get you on the dance floor without feeling way too intimidated.  However, it will be all too obvious that doing all of the moves taught on this DVD will take about one minute of time on the dance floor, so you'll have to do a lot or repeating before the song ends.

The good: It seems like decent instruction and goes into as much depth as my group classes.  It's On-1 style, which is what people do in Portland, OR (and on the west coast. If you live in New York or on the east coast, you might not appreciate starting off learning On-1 if everyone you'll dance with does On-2).  The instruction was easy to follow and there were some handy tips mentioned.  Also, the instructor is outgoing, confident and slightly amusing in his own way.

Anyway, aside from the obvious shortcoming (instructors wearing clothing that's too dark with a relatively dark background in a somewhat dimly lit room), I wish they covered a couple more simple beginner patterns.  They didn't even teach a simple cross body lead which is about as basic as you can get.  It's a great intro, or maybe more to the point, it's a great start to what looks like it would be a great intro, but falls just a bit short of five stars due to the lack of beginner moves/combos taught.  ***I just noticed that this DVD is included in their 3 disc beginner set.***  After watching this for the 2nd time, I realized there is a BONUS COMBO taught after the credits roll!  I wonder how many people have missed this.

Overall, I think it's decent, but the price is a little high for the material covered.  By watching youtube videos alone (for free!), one could get access to way more beginner video instruction, although it would be quite a bit less convenient than just popping in a DVD and watching on your tv where both partners can easily see everything.  If you're serious about learning salsa and are considering buying this DVD, just buy the Beginner 3 Pack set.  Even though I haven't watched the other two discs, if they're anything like this DVD, the amount of material covered will make it more worth the price.  Less than twice the price for three times the instruction.  The dark clothes/dark room thing wasn't really all that bad, I just adjusted my tv to make everything a little brighter and it became a non-issue.

Go buy the 3 Pack set.  Find a dance partner who wants to learn as much as you do.  Practice, practice, practice.  Get out dancing and have FUN!  (and don't forget to keep practicing and learning new moves!)  Learning salsa is very challenging and will take tons of practice but the reward can be a lifetime of social dancing.",1322092800,8,2967,4.45
2046100,3,B0001ZJQ6I,I didn't like the black background as it was too hard for me to view.  But instructions were very good.,1315958400,,103,4.15

2046103,1,B0001ZJQ6I,"I ordered this DVD because I wanted to learn basic Salsa dance steps.  Unfortunately, the quality of the filming in this video is TERRIBLE.  The demonstrating instructors are wearing black and doing their demo in a dimly lit room against a black background.  You can't see what they're doing.  It's as simple as that.  Don't waste your money on this DVD.  The cover of the DVD is attractive and might tempt you into thinking this is professionally-produced lessons series, and it might be if you could actually see the movements of the dance instructors.  Don't be fooled by the cover...this DVD is practically worthless because of the way it was filmed.  Honestly, how difficult would it have been for them to have a light backdrop so you could see the instructors, or dress the instructors in light clothing and shoes and put more light into the room?

I have been following the video for about 4 weeks now and have really come along and its held my interest, another thing I have liked is its also improving my fitness (i am on a new year regime!)

I've always been envious of those dancers who not only know what they are doing, but look confident while doing it.... I was a little skeptical of how easy this DVD would be to follow (and let's face it, I'm no Gene Kelly), but once I got it started I was thrilled to discover that not only could I keep up, but I actually understood what the DVD instructor was talking about! I was able to pick up the basic steps much quicker than I thought would be possible.

It also taught me how to turn. I'm a natural dancer but it gave me concrete steps which I just do without thinking. That being said I do believe this will teach ANYBODY to dance.

If you have never danced before I guess you can get something out of the DVD lessons.  A couple of warnings: first, the instructor is teaching an ""On 1"" style, not ""On 2"" (NYC style salsa dancing).  This is a major style difference.  Most annoying is the slow pace of the DVD -- largely becuase this guys talks too much!  At the end of disc 1 all you have learned is a very basic turn that he calls a ""salsa pattern"".

My wife and I have taken thousands of dollars in ballroom lessons in other dances and these DVD's do it better and cheaper. A bit of advice is: don't be afraid to modify your lead for the height of your partners.  I am considerably taller than my wife so some of the leads didn't work.

If you learn all of the patterns in these 5 DVDs you will have some great dancing skills.  You can add to, or modify them later as your skill level rises.",1167955200,4,514,4.257731958762887

Volume one doesn't go into much variety. That's OK though because the instructor concentrates on a lot of details that will give you a polished look once you do get to advanced movements.

All the reviewers who spoke about the ease of the instruction and the useful teaching aids were right on the money. Both are priceless; they're what set the Salsa Crazy presents DVDs apart from all of the others.,1151539200,5,309,4.43859649122807
2046215,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I was first introduced to the Salsa Crazy series about a year and a half ago. It was part of a bet I'd lost where I had to learn to do a routine and had to perform it in specific attire...I drew the Salsa out of the dances hat and after they spun me around, I found myself cross-eyed and looking at an Energizer bunny costume. To make a long story short, I was given the Learn to Dance Salsa 1 DVD and told I had to do one of the patterns on the DVD with the other unlucky ""winner"" of the night (she stopped spinning in front of the frog costume) while in the costume two weeks later. We did pretty good, considering, and I have to admit it was a sight to see an energizer bunny and frog working our Salsa hips.

To be honest, I don't know if we would have done as well as we did if we had learned with another DVD. The instruction was really easy to follow and it wasn't the least bit overwhelming because we were able to practice repeatedly with the instructor before moving on to the next part of each dance move. I like it so much I kept using the DVD even after the performance.",1150848000,6,1083,4.013888888888889

I also had seen the results of working with the DVD as my friend was very willing to show off his newfound dancing skills each week as he mastered steps. What I didn't know about was the added learning tools (good instruction being the first, of course) which a represented in the form of close-ups of the feet on different dance moves, breaks for tips when approaching a move, and multiple run-throughs of moves plus, the DVD is set up in chapters so it makes it easy to do a lesson up until a particular point then pick up with the next lesson when you're ready.

I enjoyed using the DVD and with each week that I used it, I steadily saw progress.",1150416000,3,875,4.2395209580838324
2046217,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"This DVD series was way more than I expected. The beginner's DVD is a great introduction to Salsa dancing. You truly do learn the basics. You'll start off with counting, rather than dancing, so you'll understand the basis on which salsa movements are built. After that, you'll dive right in to learning the basic Salsa step. It does take a while to imprint into your brain--and the instructors know that--so there's plenty of time allowed for repetition. Once you learn that, you'll move into doing some basic turns and by the time the first DVD is done, you will have learned a couple dance routines.

What's also nice about the DVD is that there are actually two instructors; One who teaches movements for the leaders and one who teaches movements for the followers. Because of this, it's a great DVD for couples or friends who would like to learn to Salsa.",1150070400,4,859,4.688741721854305

After a week it came and we tried it that first night... and it's awesome!  We did the 1st DVD in just 2 sessions! We now can do all the steps(5) correctly.  You'll not only learn the step, you learn the count, timing, styling and get tips as you go!  This is sooo good, if you can dance a little bit, you can do the SALSA in 2 sessions!

It costs a bit to get it to Namibia, but I'm ordering Vol 2 & 3 (Should have done 1,2 & 3 from the start!)

Simply Brilliant!

I wish I can find this quality Coaching on DVD for other Latin Dances!!! ??",1148947200,7,696,3.893617021276596
2046219,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Excellent! I have all three of the first DVDs in the Learn to Dance Salsa series. I like them all. The instructors are excellent. The main instructor, Evan, describes every move you're to make to a tee. He explains, demonstrates, then talks you through it as he does the move along with you. By the end of the DVD, you'll be exposed to the basic step, a couple turns and doing dance combinations with a partner.",1148428800,5,411,4.421052631578948
2046220,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"If you're looking for a good dance DVD to help you learn to Salsa dance, this one is a good one to go with.

Bells and whistles you will not find on this DVD. About as hi-tech as it gets is the picture-in-picture technology so that you can have a close-up view of footwork. But that's a good thing. Instead of trying to distract you with ""cool stuff"" the makers of Learn to Dance Salsa Beginner's volume 1 focused on providing sustenance.

The sustenance offered up on this DVD comes in two forms: direction and information. The directional information is, of course, the dance lessons. The basic step is taught piece by piece from the counts you're supposed to step on to the steps themselves. How to do basic turns is also addressed during the beginning portions of the DVD and by the time you get to the second half of the DVD, you'll find yourself intertwined with your partner performing patterns. Did you catch that? The partners thing? Well that's another reason why this is a great DVD. The lessons are for partners, which makes sense Salsa dancing is a couples dance. Right from the beginning of the DVD, when the basic step is introduced, the lessons are taught with partners in mind as the instructors demonstrate to foot movements for each. Additional information concerning partners taught includes:  (1) stance / frame, (2) tips for the leader on what to do to let the follower know which way they want the follower to go as well as how the follower can recognize those signals, and (3) what both the follower and leader need to know before heading out on the dance floor.

As for the informational sustenance, it comes at the end of the DVD (or the beginning if you're the overzealous type) as the special features. Once again, the information isn't just fluff. The features include a brief history of Salsa as well as tips on Salsa etiquette. (Bet you didn't know there was such a thing.) Now, the topics addresses are quite common but the delivery of the tips (quite comical) is reason enough to take a peek. Besides, the tips remind you how to be courteous when the situations described occur-something that's very important in any social dancing environment.

Bottom line: Learn to Dance Salsa volume 1 for beginners is a great DVD to help you learn Salsa so if that's what you're looking for, you've found it.",1147392000,15,2329,4.643203883495145
2046221,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"We had such a wonderful time learning to Salsa dance with this DVD. It was perfect pacing for us and the amount of information given wasn't overwhelming in the least.

The instructors are a young lady, Moira, and a young man, Evan. Evan gives a majority of the instruction and shows the man's role in the Salsa dance while Moira shows us ladies what we're supposed to do.

There are a lot of different things taught on the DVD. As you would expect, the first part is very focused on the basics so you learn the counts for Salsa music and the basic step followed by everything you need to know so you can dance with your partner without stepping on his toes. Now, this is the point my husband and I are at but fast-forwarding through the DVD, I know that we are in for some really fun stuff once we get there. Looks like we'll be learning how to do some turns and some dance routines. I wasn't expecting to be able to do a full routine once finishing the first DVD, the second, maybe, but not the first, so that was a really exciting to find out. My husband and I are happy that we chose this DVD from Salsa Crazy.",1147305600,8,1113,4.196261682242991
2046222,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I decided it was time for me to learn to dance...but I knew learning in public was out...so I ordered the Learn to dance Salsa series. I like it, mainly because it is so basic, this first one in particular, but I mean that in a good way though. The thing about the DVD is that you start off slow. Real slow. The DVD starts off with a lesson on counting. Now, that may sound elementary but you'll be thankful for the lesson as you get further into the DVD. The counting basically drills it into your head the counts you're supposed to move on and the ones you pause for in order to do the basic step. They make it so easy. And forget about looking awkward doing the move. The coordination of which hip is supposed to move in sync with the foot movements is also described. Next comes a lesson on turning to the left and the right. It's trickier than it sounds but definitely a move that you can get down pretty well if you practice it in between ""lessons"".

I also really liked the fact that the DVD had a male and female instructor to show both the leader and follower parts and that the instructors don't wait until 4 DVDs in to start teaching you how to dance with a partner. The portion on couples begins with a quick demonstration and explanation on how you should stand and where to hold one another. The instructors also clue you in to the ""4 points of contact"" that make it easier for leaders to know what to do to let followers to know the type of movement they want / where they're taking the follower on the next move.

After that, the lessons turn to well, turns. Turning to the right, actually. After that, be ready to move on to doing the basic step, with the outside (right) turn and a move called an open break (so the follower can go ahead and turn). By the end of the DVD, you will also learn a few beginner salsa patterns (routines).

Once the DVD is all said and done, you'll know how to do the basic step-with a partner-and how to do the basic step while turning together. You guessed it. Just enough to get you out on the dance floor and feel like you really know what you're doing.",1147305600,8,2103,4.213399503722084
2046223,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I gave in. At my fianc?'s request, I started to learn how to Salsa. I gotta say the DVD is good. Even an idiot, completely uninterested (like I was) could learn from this DVD. I picked up a thing or two the first go round and darn it if I didn't learn that DVD through and through after a month...and then moved on to the second! I thought the music was fun, and that the instructors were really clear. Plus, the close ups were a great way for me to see what moves I was supposed to be making when I was unclear.

But it turned out to be a really good experience because almost everyone in there was new to Salsa. I can't say we all walked away premo Salsa dancers but it's been a month and I still remember the basic step pretty well. Says a lot about the instruction on DVD.

2046236,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"You can buy volumes 1-3 now in a single 3 pack DVD set so this review is for all three of the first volumes for beginners.  The DVDs have three divisions: the dance lessons, an etiquette tutorial, and some history or out-takes.  The lessons are nicely paced but you realy need a partner to learn the steps well.  Since the focus is on learning to dance in clubs space you don't need a ballroom sized area but you will need a good open space to practice in.  The lessons have two distinct sets of instructions: for the leader and for the follower.  While the couples teaching are male and female and fall into the traditional roles, I was pleased that the series does not use gendered terms because others may wish to Salsa too.  I also liked the fact that these are average looking folks having fun -- no fancy costumes or heavy make-up, no supermodels or movie stars.

I would recommend for those whose have the basic step down already to purchase the 2nd one at the same time.  My husband and I went through the beginners DVD really quickly.  He's danced (unstructured) Salsa and had to ""un-learn"" some of the improper things that prohibit good flow between a couple.  Overall a wonderful video.

Not only were the steps given easy to follow but there was also an inset close-up of the move to which helped me ensure that I was executing moves correctly. The head instructors on this DVD were Evan and Moira, both of which users of the full series will see again in subsequent DVDs.

 If you have yet to purchase a SalsaCrazy instructional DVD considering the set as each video builds on what was taught in the previous one.

2046255,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Learn to Dance Salsa Beginner's Volume 1 is just that; a beginning dancing DVD...but with a few nice extras.

As you dance your way through this DVD, you'll learn the basic Salsa step and tips for remembering the counts on which you're supposed to move. You can also expect to learn a few simple combinations (basic step into a standard turn) and what the rest of your body is supposed to be doing (hip and arms) while your feet are moving. It's dancing people. You've got to coordinate! Fortunately for the coordinated-challenged, there is plenty repetition of the movements taught to help you get them down pat sooner rather than later.

The bonuses of this DVD that make learning Salsa easier are the picture in picture effect used so students can get a close up view of the footwork. Another nice surprise on the DVD is that movements and positioning are taught for both the leader and the follower. Perfect for couple wanting to learn Salsa together or the overachiever that likes to play both parts.

Overall, I give Learn to Dance Salsa Volume 1 DVD 5-stars. The DVD is filled with make-you-want-to-move your hips music. It's entertaining. It has some educational elements to it (Salsa history & etiquette). And most importantly, it teaches you how to dance Salsa-moves you can go out and use the next weekend.

I found the instructors, Evan and Moira, to be very easy to follow and the time for repetition of new moves right after they were taught was great. Even though this is a DVD and I can stop and rewind on a whim, it was nice not having to do so. I was also very thankful for the picture in picture effect used on the DVD to show important moves more closely. Most of all I enjoyed the fact that the DVD teaches more than just the basic step.

Thanks to this easy-to-follow video, my wife and I were able to work on the steps--with the shades drawn.  I stepped on her toes, she stepped on mine, and then slowly the groove kicked in.  The hosts of the series are easy-going, patient, and throw in some humor.  They leave time for idiots like me to catch up, encouraging along the way.  My only complaint is that the lighting was a bit dim near their feet, making it more difficult to follow sometimes.  Otherwise, nicely done.

I would recommend this for all others--usually of the male persuasion--who want to romance their ladies, but fear the wrath of the two left feet.  This series may very well rekindle that urge to sweep her off her feet.  (Just don't drop her afterwards!)

Thanks to the makers of this series, that should be a much lesser fear than in the past for fellows such as myself.  Now we'll have to take it out in public...",1138838400,5,1039,4.526881720430108

They're not the same as having Evan standing 5 feet away and telling me how to swivel my hips but I'm certain it's the next best thing!

The DVD is set up very similarly to how the classes at the San Francisco Dance Academy are taught. You learn what you're supposed to do, what your partner is supposed to be doing, how we're supposed to do what we're doing together and even tips on how to do it all smoothly once you get the hang of what you're supposed to do in the first place.

2046288,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"I have to confess: I AM NOT A DANCER. No way, no how. 2 left feet and clumsy. So I view this DVD on Salsa dancing from the standpoint--can someone ELSE learn to dance as I am --hopeless--.

The DVD begins by explaining Salsa terms (isn't is weird to have a dance turn called ""Kentucky"" in Latin Dance? but there you are) This is important; should you go to a Latin dance class, you will be familiar with the words used by the instructors and not be saying ""what?"" (or ""que?"" ) all the time. There is a bit on the art of Salsa, the background. This impressed me; when I studied music, I found that knowing the history and background of the art form made for better expressiveness on my part--it makes you part of the artform, not a spectator.

This DVD series also differs in that it includes dance club etiquette and a bit on presentation--how to look hot and sexy while dancing. Is this silly? Nope. Dance is about performance. So looking caliente is really as important as not treading on one's partner's high heels. It makes a huge difference in how you are perceived as a dancer, so I give this DVD series a big thumbs up for including lessons on expression as well as simply going through the steps.

The instructional part of the video has both distance and close-up shots, including FEET (well, if anything could help me, seeing feet is about the only way you can get me to trip any kind of light fantastic.) I grade dance videos on varieties of shots included; while there are other series that include the same dance from different angles, I give this DVD a good mark for showing close vs distance.

The DVD series goes from ""beginner"" to  ""intermediate""--but this would be for amateurs. If you are going onto the professional performance circuit, you are going to need personalized instruction. But for couples who want to dance on weekends, this makes a great addition to the home library.

Summary: nice series, lots of info. Fun for couples.",1135209600,17,1954,4.536931818181818
2046289,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"As a non-dancer, I had serious reservations about spending time with this disk.  I mean, how could I review it?  Would it mean anything to me at all?  Instead, I found it not only enjoyable, it even got me attempting the moves that were demonstrated by the instructors!

The instructors on the DVD are clearly experienced dance instructors who convey enthusiasm and confidence to their students (those of us watching the video).  Each segment is clearly explained and builds logically on what the student has learned and is all based on a very basic dance step.

The video of the instructors dancing also includes an inset in the lower left corner that shows their feet as well as their full body in the main screen.  There is enough repetition to help the student grasp the idea.  However, since you can rewind and watch the segment as much as you need, they don't beat each idea to death.

Frankly, I was pretty amazed at how far they take you in this first video.  This may all be basic to them, but there are some pretty good looking moves in this first disk.  I also like the way they emphasize how the leader and follower communicate the intended moves to each other and why good dance position is important to being able to execute the dance moves.

They also have segments where they offer very helpful tips about the ideas you have just learned.

Don't be in a hurry to turn off the video at the credits.  There is a bonus move after the credits!

Also, there is another segment on the history of Salsa Dancing, Club etiquette, and a short section of outtakes that are not only amusing, but let you see that even these skilled dancers have foibles.

If you like to dance, or would like to try dancing, this dance is great because it is easier to learn than many, but has enough variety that you can take it as far as you wish.",1135036800,,1835,4.432835820895522
2046290,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I love music. I love dancing. I thought ... well, maybe I could figure this dance out ...

Vol 1: Salsa Dancing Guide for Beginners (2000) is a great guide to getting out of the living room and onto the dance floor.

This video tutorial makes learning to dance the Salsa easy. Step by step instructions include for the leader and then the follower (male then female):

1 - count the beats 1 - 2 - 3 - x - 5 - 6 - 7 - x

2 - walk the steps with the instruction and match the pause with each ""x""

3 - practice each step to the count

4 - dance each step to music

5 - learn to move your hips with the steps - not right foot, right hip, but opposites for the sexy salsa body language.

It is easy to follow the steps with the instructor dancing on the full screen beside with a small corner that is cut away to just the footwork. This helps to get the feel for the music, the beat, and the steps, but you don't feel lost as the rhythm of the music gets faster.

The video is a timed slow progression. By the time you have completed the first video you are confident that you have the basics down and are ready to Salsa.

The first thing I discovered is that I'm out of shape. But then I felt excited because I found something I love that also improves my cardiovascular strength in a fun exercise.

Ths video prepares you for ""Salsa Crazy Presents: Learn to Salsa Dance, Volume 2: Salsa Dancing Guide for Beginners.""

2046291,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Salsa Dancing. Not really my forte but being the dedicated reviewer I am, I didn't dare slink away from the challenge before me: ""Learn To Dance Salsa, Beginners Volume 1"" by the folks over at Salsa Crazy.

The DVD starts off with some basic information about Salsa, counting and such, then focuses on the basic step. As the DVD progresses, the motion of the basic step is reiterated multiple times...which was a good thing as it helped to make the motion mindless-which is important is you want to focus on dancing and not counting or where your feet are going, right? After that the lessons on the DVD turn to some more interesting moves like turns and moves. You get to learn a couple dance combos too. That was surprising 'cause I thought for sure I wouldn't learn a single thing I could actually do in public. Not on a beginners DVD.

Throughout the whole DVD, there's a male and a female instructor who demonstrate the moves that the leader and follower should be doing throughout the dance. Now I haven't watched too many dance DVDs in my lifetime but I thought that was a fairly unique addition to the lesson. I figure most dance lessons, especially those on video / DVD just shows you the move without regard to whether you'd likely be leading of following. Now correct me if I'm wrong but seems to me two folks who only know how to lead (or how to follow) would have some trouble teaming up with one another on the dance floor, don't you think?

The music, great. Production quality, good. And like I said before the picture in picture, awesome. Plus there are some interesting snippets on the DVD menu for those who really like to immerse themselves in things they learn: etiquette, history, etc. So in my book, the DVD gets a thumbs-up without reservation. I am however, the leopard whose spots cannot be changed. I'm still not a fan of Salsa, dancing just isn't my thing but I can say that I learned enough to charm a lady or two...and that was without even really trying to learn. So imagine what someone who really wanted to learn how to dance Salsa could do.

2046292,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"This DVD provides an introduction to salsa dancing for rank beginners.  The main part of the DVD (about 70 minutes) is comprised of lessons.  These lessons cover timing and structure of salsa music and dance, the basic step, leading and following, and common patterns of moves.  In addition to these lessons, there is a short section on etiquette (how to invite a partner to dance or accept or turn down an invitation, and what to do when you step on or bump into someone else on the dance floor, altogether about 5 minutes), and an interview with musicologist Dr. Rita Hargrave about the history of salsa music (about 15 minutes).  The main menu gives access to the section of lessons, etiquette tips, history of salsa music.  There is a sub-menu for lessons that allows you to jump to any specific lesson of your choice.

I found the instructions about the basic step and common patterns very clear and easy to follow (even though I'm an utter klutz and not much of a dancer).  The instructors describe the key movements step-by-step, counting time, and offer tips about what to do and what not to do on each count.  They discuss the differences between leading and following in each of the steps and patterns (and mostly consistently use the terms ""leader"" and ""follower"" rather than ""male"" and ""female""). The supporting videography is not quite as clear as it should be, however.  The main problem is that the director did not pay enough attention to light and dark contrast on the set.  The instructors are dressed mostly in black clothes, and they are shown in a dimly-lit room against dark backgrounds.  They wear black shoes, and the floor is dark brown.  As a result, when they demonstrate feet going forwards and back, or hips swaying, it is very hard to pick out the details of the movement on the screen.  The images would have been much easier to follow if the instructors had worn white trousers, skirts, and shoes, even if such clothing isn't as ""cool"" as black.  Alternatively, they could have been shown against a brightly lit white background.  Either way, their movements would be much easier to follow if there were only some more contrast between light and dark.  One nice feature of the lessons is the screen-within-the screen image, that focuses on key details from an alternative camera angle.  The sound quality of the instructors' voices is quite good (although it would have been nice to get all phones in the dance hall turned off before commencing shooting).

The interview with Rita Hargrave on the history of salsa dancing is a wonderful addition to the disc.  Hargrave is a phenomenally articulate speaker-I am blown away by how much information she can convey about the many varied roots of salsa music in such a short time.  However, the interview with her takes a few minutes to get on topic-it might have been good to cut the less relevant parts of the interview in favor of getting a practice cut on the DVD, one showing a typical dance hall scene with two couples dancing to salsa music and using just the steps that are taught on this DVD.  That's what's really missing here-a prolonged chance to try out the steps and practice them all to music.",1134000000,8,3185,4.712996389891697
2046293,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the SalsaCrazy Salsa Dancing DVD series. I've reviewed all five of the discs in the series so if you're thinking about buying the entire series, be sure to check out my other reviews for a sneak peak of what you can expect. Now that's out of the way, here's my take on the first DVD in the series, SalsaCrazy presents Learn to Dance Salsa Beginners Volume 1.

Right when you turn on the Learn to Dance Salsa Volume 1 DVD, you're greeted with energetic music designed to make you stay on your feet and get into the Salsa mood. As with most DVDs these days, you'll come up on a menu page with various options but, just like you, I was ready to get to the good stuff...the dancing. So decked out in gym shorts and my cutest high-heeled, try-to-look-the-part salsa shoes, I hit play, waiting for the beat start so I could get my hips swaying. I got the music but the hip swaying would have to wait a few minutes.

The host, Evan Margolin, starts off the DVD with key insider tips on Salsa dancing. For those who are impatient, take three deep breaths and focus. After all, it is a basic dance DVD and the information is a bona fide anecdote for at least part of the frustration any new dancer will incur. Now, some may not like that as I said, I've been taken more than a few salsa dancing lessons in my lifetime and can honestly say that even starting today all that was being taught on the first part of the DVD seemed like something brand new to me.

So now I've done all this set up, I bet you want to know what `ol Margolin is talking about. Well, as soon as you get into the DVD, he teaches you how the counts for Salsa dancing work, which beats to actually move on, and the rhythm of the beats. (A la the title.) It takes a minute to comprehend it all but once it clicks in your mind, the following lessons are much easier...and you're more likely to remember what you learned the next time you pop in the DVD for another dance lesson. After that, there's less talk and more dance with Margolin teaching the leaders' basic dance moves and his partner, Moira Denike, showing followers the corresponding dance moves. As a beginner dancer, you will keep building on the moves you learn throughout this DVD and subsequent DVD in the Learn to Dance series.

After you've been taught the basic step, there are many times it is repeated as you're learning how hip movement, arm movement and later on, posture, play into mastering the basic step. Now, don't get overwhelmed just reading this. The lessons are well paced, slowly adding on each of these movements while continuing to grasp the basic step. A neat feature also included on this DVD that is helpful in learning the various steps is the inset close-up camera shot that shows you exactly how each move is executed.

I should also mention that having a partner on hand is recommended (but not necessary) because, as I said, the instructors teach moves for both leaders and followers. Plus, you'll learn how to actually perform some of the basic dance moves with a partner. Just wait until you get to turning with the basic step! As a follower, turning right was a breeze for me. Going left...well, let's just say I'll be skipping to that scene on the DVD for a couple more days before I have that one down pat.

Overall, I think this is an excellent instructional and educational DVD for beginners. Beyond the Salsa lessons, the DVD also provides a mini a crash course in salsa dance etiquette and what is appropriate when you're at a club. And for those of you who really like to be immersed in a new hobby, some history on Salsa dancing.",1133913600,,3630,4.418535127055306

This DVD was done logically and carefully by experienced instructors who are devoted and passionate about Salsa Dancing.

It's great for beginners: you can pick it up quickly, and you can learn and practice in your own living room.

2046295,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"With its syncopated rhythms and the lively context in which it is done, salsa dance is fascinating and offers much for dancers who enjoy being creative. Like all other partnered dances, salsa prohibits the anarchy of totally free expression on the part of the dancers. However, one can be much more loose in salsa than in other forms of partnered dance. The complex music of salsa in fact almost demands that the dancers let go, and move away from the rigidity and overtraining that can accompany the usual ballroom dances.

This DVD is targeted toward the beginner, but instructors can also use it to get hints on how to proceed in their classes. Therefore the instructors in the DVD want to proceed slowly, and they speak of a ""logical progression"" in their methodology. This latter notion is often spoken of by most instructors but not quantified in detail. It would be a fascinating project though for those interested in dance instruction to understand how to optimize the learning experience in dance. Such a project would no doubt arrive at a notion of ""logical progression"" that would enable instructors to move to more complicated patterns with ease, knowing that the consequent steps they take are best for the students in the class.

The instructors in this DVD tackle the timing and rhythm in salsa first, beginning with the standard 8 beats/measure statement and the marking of time as a pause on the fourth and eight beats. The breaking of the salsa basic on the one count distinguishes it from the mambo, where the first count is held and the dancer instead moves first on the count of two. Depending on where you are in the world, or in which community you are dancing in, salsa movements could be classified as mambo, although one may raise an eyebrow if this claim is made in certain circles. Countries in Latin America are very protective and provincial in their dances, and one must be careful to be respectful as one travels (and dances) in these countries.

Much time is spent in this DVD on the salsa basic step, and tips are included to make it more refined. All movement is accompanied by a degree of noise, and partnered dance, because of the synchronization required, requires that noise be suppressed, and also a large degree of geometrical precision. One particularly useful tip concerns the hip action for the woman: it should be in opposition to the step action. This eliminates the ""bouncy"" action when this is not done. This of course is an aesthetic requirement, put in to make the dance pleasing to observers. It will not throw one off balance or make the dance less difficult if it is not respected. Aesthetics also rules the ""bonus tip"" that is given: pigeon toeing is to be avoided at all times. Other tips though are essential to making the dance work in a physical sense, such as moving the body with the step, and not just ""stepping out"", in keeping the feet together when in neutral position, in keeping the weight off the heels when stepping back, in keeping the elbows matched, and most importantly in maintaining a fairly rigid frame.

The instructors recommend small steps, and this is sound advice considering the usual tempo of salsa music and the fact that usually the typical dance floor is crowded with dancers. In addition, they cover three ""dance patterns"" for the salsa: the first being the ladies outside turn (with open break), the right-to-right with men's hair brush (ladies hair brush also), and opposing turns for the lady and the man.

The instructors are aware of the addictive nature of salsa dance, and no doubt as preparation for the next two volumes of instruction they speak of creating salsa patterns ""on the fly."" They do not want to overtrain the salsa-dancing enthusiast, realizing that following patterns for their own sake in salsa is an anathema. One must break free of what one has learned and engage in the delight of play. Rigidity, a holding to the ensembles of what has been learned in prior musings of thought or effort, is of course a deadly virus in any field, to be cured only by the antibody called creativity.",1133654400,9,4094,4.76056338028169
2046296,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"This DVD will get you dancing salsa even if you thought you could never learn how to dance.  Each step, move and pattern on this DVD is explained in great detailed.

The wonderful feature of this DVD is that you get to see the important points of each move simultaneously from two angles - one of the angles is shown in the lower left corner of your screen.

Then you get to practice each move several times without the music and then you get to practice it several times with the music.

The male and female dancer then provide you with any additional tips to perform the move smoothly.  Some common stumbling blocks and errors beginners make are mentioned, as well as all that you need to know and pay attention to in order to do the move correctly.

Then you practice the move several more times and review what you've learned up to that point.  These numerous repetitions of each move will help you to establish a very solid foundation.  The dance instructors on this DVD guide you along at such an easy-to-follow pace, that you won't have to click on stop and rewind buttons on your remote control to figure out what happened.

While this DVD is best suited for the absolute beginners (you learn the basic step, few turns and a hair-brush pattern), it does happen that guys who take salsa classes learn the steps, but do not learn how to lead properly (there are guys who seem afraid to lead and there are those who lead as if they were on a battle field and it seems a matter of time before they break their partner's arm), or that the ladies do not create appropriate resistance through their arms for clear and smooth communication between the partners.  Leading and following is so thoroughly explained on this DVD that even if you've been dancing for a while, but are having a challenge creating rapport and communication with your partner, this DVD will definitely help you.",1133568000,7,1885,4.550295857988166
2046297,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"I never thought in a million years that I would ever feel compelled to write a review on a ""Learn to Salsa"" DVD. It was something I had never even thought about doing. I am not a dancer, although I have always admired those who are, but I am a lover of Salsa music and own many cds. But I must say, that after one viewing of this DVD, I was hooked. I enjoy it. And believe me, if I can do it, then anyone can do it. It is a lot easier than I thought it would be and the lessons are very easy to follow. And so...in a short while I hope to progress to the 2nd DVD in this series. So watch out...Gillian is on her way....",1132531200,5,619,3.769230769230769
2046298,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"For beginners, dance lessons could have an intimidating impact, as it often requires taking the first step to register and expose personal limitations on the dance floor.  However, SalsCrazy's - Learn to Dance: Vol. 1 (Beginners) allows the beginner to take their first step towards successful accomplishment of the initial steps of salsa in the safety of home.  This DVD also offers a terrific opportunity for those interested in Salsa, but does not have an opportunity to study it with a dance teacher in their hometown.  It even offers a terrific chance for the more confident viewers to brush up on their skills and maybe hear a different approach to salsa through the television or computer.  Thus, the skilled dancer Evan Margolin provides a comprehensive learning opportunity with the help of his two first class dancers Moira Denike and Rita Hargrave.

After a brief introduction, the SalsaCrazy's - Learn to Dance: Vol. 1 (Beginners) teaches the viewer of the rhythm and timing of salsa, as this is where the foundation of the dance rests.  Subsequently, the DVD will inform about the basic steps for both the leader and follower, first without the music and then with music, which is the format of all moves in this first disc.  This is good teaching practice, as it allows for the audience to first visually learn and then, maybe, practice before the music is incorporated into the steps and moves. They also use split screens to teach the audience where one can see the full body and the major area of movement simultaneously, which enhances the moment of learning.  The students also will learn how to smooth out the moves while making open break outside turns and opposing turns.  After studying of the SalsaCrazy's DVD the student will be able to enter the dance floor with increased confidence and skill, as it definitely teaches the viewer the beginning steps.

Do not forget to look after the end credits because there is a bonus pattern for the students to master.  In the menu of the DVD there are additional features that are useful for newcomers on the salsa dance floor.  Here the viewer can learn about dance etiquette and some of the history of salsa by Rita Hargrave.  However, the historical background is a rather tiresome event, as she talks with Evan about the history.  Personally, I would liked to see a little more substance with archived footage that could have made it a little more interesting.  The final piece on the DVD is a number of outtakes and blunders made by Evan and his two partners.  At first sight this might not seem like much, but it offers the viewer a chance to realize that everyone makes mistakes while dancing and shows them that they should think of the importance of having fun while dancing salsa.

The SalsaCrazy's - Learn to Dance: Vol. 1 (Beginners) comes in widescreen, but the image could have been a little better.  Nonetheless, it is not on the look of the image that one should judge this DVD, but on the content.  Everything was very well presented with the exception of the history portion.  In the end, it is a terrific teaching tool for beginners of salsa, as it provides a great chance for the audience to learn by themselves or with a small group of people.  However, keep in mind this is only the first volume, as the second volume will help develop more of the beginner's skills.",1132444800,5,3354,4.738382099827883
2046299,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Salsa dancing seems to intimidating to the non-dancer.  I definately include myself in that category.  While I do know the difference between the right and left foot, my skills take time to develop.  I have taken some other forms of dancing lessons, and I like these a great deal.

When you take a class, it is a little intimidating, you have people there of all levels.  At home, guess what, it is just you and possibly your partner.  You can practice some on your own.  I like this video because it starts nice and slow.  Yes, I was learning to salsa in about 30 minutes.

The narration is good, and well paced.  I liked that it shows the leader and the follower steps.  It doesn't matter who is who.  One thing I really liked about these DVDs is that on the lower left of the screen they show a shot of what your feet are doing, or should be doing.  This is extremely helpful so you can check and make sure that you are moving properly.

This is a well produced video.  Sometimes videos of this nature have bad production.  The music is too loud, the audio gets muffled, or it just looks unprofessional.  You can tell they put time into producing a great lesson here.  Honestly, I like this approach to dancing, becuase its tough and awkard in a class at times, and this makes it a lot easier to practice in the privacy of your own home.",1132358400,6,1340,4.313253012048193
2046300,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"First, a confession - I've always been a little scared to try anything other than the usual basic dances moves, nothing the least bit noticable. I just wanted to be able to get out on the dance floor and not make a fool out of myself.

So let's just say I was a little...wary...of trying to learn Salsa, a type of dance which I think of as incredibly romantic and sexy. I've always loved watching Salsa dancers and I've been envious of their grace, rhythm and style. I never for a monent, however, believed I could do anything remotely similar. But, DVD in hand (a gift), I was game to give it a try.

This DVD made learning Salsa not only painless but fun and before long, my partner and I were actually moving through the steps and, better yet, we actually KNEW what we were doing. We looked like the dancers on the DVD, if only a ""touch"" less professional (okay, a lot less professional but it WAS our first time). Now we're working our way through the DVDs,  Learn to Dance Salsa 2 and Learn to Dance Salsa 3 and I can actually say that we are getting better and better all the time. Plus, it is a lot of fun to practice!

What makes this DVD a standout? The instructors start out by explaining the basics of Salsa so that once you work into the actual dance movements, you have some idea of what Salsa actually is and where it fits in the dance spectrum. You aren't just mimicking steps but actually expressing a certain mood and feeling. That is a major plus right there. If you are going to Salsa, you want to create a total effect, not look like a robot going through the motions.

The instruction itself is very easy to follow, with both full-length and close-up shots of the dancers' feet, going at a very easy, step by step pace at first and gradually working up to a brisker tempo. We found ourselves smiling from start to finish, amazed at how much fun this was. Be forewarned, however- depending on your partner, you may be compelled to take a few romantic interludes as Salsa can be amazingly sexy and just moving together in rhythmic harmony while practicing the moves that lead one's thoughts to further romance...but that's another plus, to my way of thinking (think of it as a free bonus, if you will).

ONE NOTE: If you are already a professional Salsa dancer, these DVDs may not be for you. They are definitely designed for the beginning Salsa dancer but ""beginning"" is a matter of perception. If you're among professional dancers, perhaps you won't come across as a pro but if you're dancing at parties or other events, you may come across as far more expreienced.

When we actually danced in public, people thought we were more than beginners, especially since the DVDs taught us how to ""talk the talk"" as well as ""dance the dance"", using such the right terms for each step, terms which are discussed in detail on the DVD. No one knew we'd just started learning Salsa and that was gratifying to us.

 There is a lot of info on this DVD, including tips on looking sexy (although the moves themselves go a long way in giving that impression) and Dance Club Etiquette, always useful to know.",1132272000,123,3111,4.453427065026362
2046301,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"This is the coolest video ever. My mom gifted this DVD to me and I didn't quite expect it to be so interesting and cool. Evan is the coolest and the greatest instructor. His instructions are so simple to follow and everything is explained in detail. Very soon I'll be moving on to the next level and I just can't wait to show my moves to my friends and surprise them. Now, I love dancing in parties!!!! People, If you are interested in salsa and planning to learn this DVD won't disappoint you. Trust me you'll love it as much as I did.",1131840000,,536,4.213592233009709
2046302,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"The Salsa Series, this being Part 1 in a 5-part series on learnign this dance, the instructions are clear and direct and even two left feet will find the Salsa moves.  Following the instructions that are so carefully laid out will make a dancer out of anyone.

The Salsa lessons are prefaced with a rich description of the style; positions; moves and history of this Latin dance.  Viewers will be able to apply these steps to other forms of Latin dances as the Salsa is a good point of reference.

Moira Denike, a very beautiful and talented dancer provides a visual lesson in the art of Salsa with Evan.  They are a good dance partnership.  Their patient repetition of the steps will certainly help to ensure that viewers practicing the moves will be able to dance like they do.  Speed is increased and music is included.  Rhythm, flow and moves such as the open break and outside turn are added.

Viewers are also treated to watching Evan dancing with Rita Hargrave, so as to get an even clearer feel for how different dancers approach the core steps.  The little ""instruction box"" which appears in the corner of the screen helps viewers reinforce what they have learned.

I like Evan's dance instruction approach; he breaks each step down clearly and is easy to follow.  He has a very pleasant demeanor and will, no doubt spark an interest in Salsa dancing among many people!",1131235200,2,1378,4.648760330578512
2046323,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"This review refers to ""Learn To Dance Salsa: Beginners Vol 1""

Did you ever see the Seinfeld episode in which Elaine dances at a party, and everyone laughs at her moves(and rightly so)? That's me. I am a terrible dancer and what's more I have, or should say had no rhythm. I decided to give this a try anyway.  I do work out quite a bit though, so I approached it the same way I do my video workouts.

First I viewed it all the way through, so I knew what to expect. Watching it I saw the instructors and the dancers, breaking down every move so easily, and repeating each of the basic steps and moves over with music, I thought ""I could do this!"" But it looked like I needed a partner, and dragged a reluctant friend into my living room. Turned out, we both actually learned the  FUNdamentals(yes it was a blast), and thought we looked pretty good doing it as well. I actually got the rhythm down.

Patiently and slowly, the instructor and dancers, will take you through the very basic steps, for leaders and followers,then to music, and then putting the moves together for both dancers. There are a total of 35 scene selections depicting different steps, and patterns of the dance, and there are picture in picture close-up so you can just watch the way their feet move. You'll also get the terminolgy down as well. Also, if you hang around and sit through the credits, at the end you will find another bonus pattern to learn.

The music is great and so is the DVD. It's nice that you could always pause or pick any scene you want to try over again. Sound and picture are excellent. The DVD says it is 2 hours of comprehensive lessons, but the actual dance instruction is about an hour and 20 minutes. The bonus features include ""Dance and Club Etiquette""(this will come in very handy when you are ready to show off what you have learned), ""Salsa History"", which was most informative, and some outakes, which were quite funny, and helped put me at ease(nobody's poifect!).

There are several levels in the Salsa Dance Lesson Series, three volumes at the Beginner level alone. So I thought the DVDs a little high priced, maybe they could put the beginning level together in a package deal. Once you start you will want to continue(I know I do) and to buy each level will run into quite an investment(my only reason for four stars, the lessons are 5 stars for sure). I see some pretty good deals through the outside sellers though(for new DVDs).

Okay, so I am not exactly Gloria Estefan yet, but I really learned the basics, enjoyed the video very much and hey, found some rhythm lurking inside of me! Oh and by the way, by the end of the hour and 20 minutes, I felt like I had quite a good low impact workout, and will be adding this to my great work out listmania as well!

Enjoy with a partner....Laurie",1131235200,35,2807,4.424418604651163
2046324,4,B0001ZJQ6I,"The video on this DVD is skilfully done. Care has gone into not assuming any expertise on the part of the viewer. Thus, the explanations are clear and the interaction of these with the relevant video segments makes for an intuitive understanding.

Another reviewer complained about the lack of enough contrast between the dancers and the background, on her TV. But I had no problem on the set I used, and perhaps that will be your experience too.",1131148800,5,446,4.717948717948718
2046325,5,B0001ZJQ6I,"Even if you have never danced before, the instruction on this Salsa Crazy DVD is so clearly given and so precise, that after practicing what is taught, you'll be able to get on the dance floor and look good. Evan Margolis is a terrific dancer, and a superb teacher, and this first beginner's DVD is very important for anyone who is not familiar with Salsa or any type of Latin dancing, even if they are well versed in other dance forms. Evan starts the lesson by describing the essence of the style and posture applicable to all forms of Latin dancing, and it's a style that is unique and essential to the genre.

Evan demonstrates the moves with Moira Denike, who is beautiful as well as skilled in the art of Salsa. This is lengthy instruction, with many repeats to insure that you learn the basics, staring slowly and picking up in speed until danced with music. You will learn the rhythm, the basic step, ""open break"" and ""outside turn"", the ""hairbrush"", ""shoulder turn"", and much more. There is also a bonus pattern, which Evan demonstrates with Rita Hargrave, and the total time of the dancing portion of the DVD is approximately an hour and 20 minutes. My only quibble would be that on my 12 year old television, Evan's dark clothing (and the portion where Moira wears a black pants outfit), there is not enough contrast between the figures and the background, and this is probably not a problem with newer TV sets. There is a box in the lower left corner that spotlights the movements, usually of the lower legs and feet, which is also helpful.

The extras include Evan's tips on ""Dance and Club Etiquette"", an interview with Rita on the history of Salsa, and some funny outtakes. As a former dancer, I'm very impressed with Evan's teaching technique, and his clarity in conveying it.  He also has a very pleasing personality, making learning how to dance fun.

For starters, the production quality is excellent. I'm a bit of a film snob so that was a definite plus. After all, if I couldn't stand to watch the video, I'd never learn to dance. But beyond that it's just an overall good instructional DVD. The instructors are clear with the instructions they give and they do close-up shots on the feet on a bunch of the moves so you can really tell what's being done as far as footwork is concerned. I'm hoping that's a signature characteristic for the Salsa Crazy DVDs because it's really helped me a lot.
