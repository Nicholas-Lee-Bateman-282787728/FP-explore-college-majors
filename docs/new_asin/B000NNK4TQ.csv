8179317,1,B000NNK4TQ,This is the worst wrestling & commentary that I have ever seen and heard. I feel like a total sucker for even buying this junk. If you are a wrestling fan looking for some hardcore ultraviolent stuff this is not the place to find it! They use the old ECW names to try to hype this crap but every ECW member thats in this is wayyyyyyyyy past their prime. I wish i could put into words how awful this DVD is. Good thing the promoter (Black) had porn money to make this crap cuz he couldn't earn a dime doing this legit. There are more busted moves and crappy entertainment in this double volume then anything I have ever purchased in my entire life. If you loved the original ECW plz do not waste ur time on this junk!,1209340800,,716,4.158273381294964
8179318,5,B000NNK4TQ,"From 1999 to 2003, XPW took hardcore wrestling to the wild extremes mostly found in the smaller Japanese promotions. For several years, XPW held a death-match tournament, Baptized in Blood, which was the company's version of the legendary tournament hosted by IWA (Japan) in the mid-1990s.

The two DVDs are the initial two tournaments, with bonus footage. With barbed wire, thumb tacks, light bulbs, glass and baseball bats as the weapons of choice, this is intense action with crimson masks. And it's no wonder that wrestlers who made their reputations by taking matches to the outer limits are featured in the tournaments (Supreme, Kronus, Axl Rotten and Johnny Webb).

This is hardcore at its most extreme and the wrestlers are the stars in some of the most brutal matches ever held in the United States.",1201132800,3,808,4.977777777777778
8179319,5,B000NNK4TQ,"i have no clue who is making these new dvds because xpw ran out of business. but this dvd is going to be great!!!!!! it is 2 discs and has
baptised in blood 1 and 2 but is missing number 3. but anyway this dvd is going to be 17.99 but i would only pay about 13$ or less and it will be worth every penny!!!!! these were both 5 star events and are incredible
so i say for about 13$ or less ....... get it!!!!!",1185580800,3,407,3.744186046511628
