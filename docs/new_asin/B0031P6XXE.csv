8387152,3,B0031P6XXE,"Super stylish film with a strong cast ensemble. A film seen through the eyes of a young girl who gets transported into the upscale world of Shanghai gangsters and Casablanca-esque intrigue. Cinematography, Music and Production design of the film is magnificent and well worth the purchase alone. The film could use a few trimmings here and there. Overall a good film.",1428192000,,367,5.032786885245901
