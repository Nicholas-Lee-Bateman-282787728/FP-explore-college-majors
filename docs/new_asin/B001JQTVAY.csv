1. Volume stinks
2. 2 dvds with various workouts. They shouldve out all on 1 dvd so u could mox as you want
3. Not advanced",1438819200,,199,3.761904761904762
8313604,2,B001JQTVAY,"I don't like this video. It is not professionally produced. The audio is poor, and the mix and match format doesn't work very well. There are 3 disks, but you can't program exercises from more than one disk, so you must use whatever programs are on that particular disk. The performers are okay, but not as motivating as Gilad or the Biggest Losers. The routines are repeated over to complete a 15 minute exercise, and are boring. There are so many better ones, that I may never use this one again.",1278288000,,498,4.483516483516484
8313605,4,B001JQTVAY,"I can not tell you what 'your' workout will be with this DVD since you choose yourself from a variety of warm-up, cardio, strength and cool down options. It truly does work just exactly as described! Personally, I did the step warm ups and workouts. Each trainer is very good at building up slowly making it easy to follow along. I am experienced with step but prefer a workout that is interesting but not too dancy or over-choreographed - for example, I prefer 'moderate' choreography rather than 'advanced'). I found the instructors, especially Geoff, to be very good with making sure you are doing the strength and stretch moves correctly. There are some sections that have modifications but not all. The only reason I did not give this DVD 5 stars is because the audio volume was very low on my player. I haven't had this problem with other DVD's but I suppose it could be my machine. FYI... the music is instrumental and very much in the background, which I like but if you're looking for loud club music you're best off elsewhere.",1236902400,2,1036,4.635869565217392
