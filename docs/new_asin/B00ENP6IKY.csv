8607110,5,B00ENP6IKY,"Heres our chance to get front row seats to Ernie Haase and Signature Sounds (EHSS) yearly Christmas shows at only a fraction of the cost.  Anyone who has had ever attended one of EHSSs Christmas concerts knows that it is more than just your ostentatious and gaudy Vegas-styled showbiz.  Rather, what you get is a wholesome evening of worship where we not only get to sing along with the cherished carols of the church, but we get to enjoy some of the theologically rich newer Christmas songs.  Further, anyone who is acquainted with EHSS knows that the quartet never lets their fans go home without indulging in some celebratory and nostalgic fun via their engaging singing of some of the well-loved Christmas favorites.  After years of such seasonal tours, StowTown Records have finally blessed us by capturing one of their concerts on this CD and DVD package.  Recorded live at the Carson Center in Paducah, KY, this DVD/CD features EHSS tackling a repertoire of Christmas carols, some popular Yuletide classics as well as a handful of originals.

Wthin the context of Southern Gospel music, EHSS need no introduction. Despite some degree of turnover of group members over the years, the current line up of EHSS includes Ernie Haase (tenor), Doug Anderson (baritone), Paul Harkey (bass) and Devin McGlamery (tenor).  Ever since their formation in 2002, EHSS has been the recipient of numerous Dove Awards and even a Grammy nomination. And one of the reasons of their popularity is the combustible passion that comes when their voices ignite. This is especially evident on the DVD: the way the different shades and textures of each member complement one another is nothing short of breathtaking.  The set gets an energetic start when the quartet offers an arresting version of Marshmallow World, an endearing classic that was first brought to attention by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Never letting the festive mood taper for a moment, they seamlessly slide into the title track of their 2009 album Every Light that Shines at Christmas.  With its strong sing along country styled melodic structure, Every Light that Shines at Christmas is one of those songs that will get the audience tapping their toes as they wait with baited breath for the songs big finish.

Changed by a Baby Boy, gets to the heart of Christmas, as EHSS testify to the mission of Jesus Christ in changing our lives around.  And such a testimony is further enhanced when the boys invite the Castle High School Choir to sing along with them.  However, one would have wished the choir would be brought back for Christmas is Christmas instead of using some pre-recorded voices of children in the background.  Speaking of children, one of the DVDs most heart rendering moment is when the four men crowd around Paul Harkeys newborn baby as they sing Eddy Ravens Thank God for Kids.  And those who like to bask in the romantic glow of the season will definitely enjoy the low bass notes of Harkey on All I Want is You.  The aforementioned Christmas is Christmas is bound to get our eyes misty as video messages of those far from home convey Christmas greetings during the song.  Nevertheless, the greatest nudge to the heart is the message from a woman who sends her greetings to her dad who is spending his first Christmas with Jesus.

Yet, not all is doleful; Ernie Haase does indulge us with some laughs over his Elvis impersonation with his bluesy rendition of Blue Christmas.  While on He Started the Whole World Singing, the boys show how they can work their audience to a high climatic ending that has everyone on their feet in honor of Jesus Christ.  Christmas Live, in sum, is more than just a glitzy show of a concert.  Rather, it is a deftly put together night of great entertainment and worship as we get to savor again and again the magic that only EHSS are capable of creating.",1384560000,4,3860,4.783132530120482
