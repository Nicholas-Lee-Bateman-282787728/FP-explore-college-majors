6199068,3,B00HR34TEG,"The golden compass is beautifully filmed. Nicole Kidman was an excellent Mrs. Coulter. The story, however, was very rushed. Almost forgivable if not for the incomplete ending. There was a lot to cover from the book and the movie tried. It could have been longer to flesh out the characters better. To not finish the story, however, was very disappointing.  If you didn't read the book, it may be better. Though, I think it would have been hard to follow.

I have not read Inkheart. I saw the movie years ago and remember it being pleasant enough to spend the little bit extra for the double feature. Which is also why I gave the review 3 stars; for its inclusion.",1414368000,,663,4.516666666666667

It did however come faster than expected.

I just LOVE The Golden Compass and wish they'd just come out with the second and third books into movies already! For those that are saying that this movie in ""incomplete"" then maybe you should actually try reading the books! The books are beyond amazing and the world they portray is beyond your imagination! The only reason why some people don't like this movie is because of it's implications of ""no god""! Also the Christian rights groups have just about had it obliterated off the face of the planet! I say get it before it is totally wipped from our existence by close minded people that don't get this is just a movie/book for entertainment not some horrible plot against ""god"". The Books are His Dark Materials Trilogy: The Golden Compass / The Subtle Knife / The Amber Spyglass.",1488499200,,1111,5.421965317919075

6199092,4,B00HR34TEG,Wish there were more movies from the novels of Chris Weitz.  Inkheart was chopped up from the original concept which would have been a little enjoyable but too long for a tween movie.,1441324800,,183,4.545454545454546
6199093,5,B00HR34TEG,these two movies are great. This was the first time i saw inkheart. This movies lets children learn how to read a book and mAKE IT COME TO LIFE in their imagination.

6199109,5,B00HR34TEG,"Remember: movie/tv/series reviews are subjective.  Everyone has an opinion and I respect all points of view, even if you don't agree with mine!
I bought this set for The Golden Compass.... Inkheart is ok... but I prefer the Golden Compass.  It is such a compelling story and I love the actors. It is sort of a sci fi, which normally I don't care for, however, the characters are so engaging that I overlook the sci fi part.  There are some parts of the movie that are frightening... but I would let my child 8 or older watch it. They set it up for such a great sequel and yet... there hasn't been one.",1418342400,4,601,4.300884955752212

8634564,5,B00HR34TEG,Two very good movies if you like Brendan Fraser's movie you'll like ink heart. Golden compass is also good except for the ending it's like 3/4 of a movie and they left off then end. Oh and they aren't making another one yet they left it off that way so they could and they need to make another golden compass but probably won't not anytime soon.,1531699200,,345,4.242424242424242
8634565,5,B00HR34TEG,Both great movies and awesome to have in my collection.  Both could use a sequel if they kept the same actors who have all aged so I'm not sure how that would work.,1522540800,,164,3.9696969696969697
