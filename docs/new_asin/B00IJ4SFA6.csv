6265629,5,B00IJ4SFA6,"This internationally syndicated program is now on DVD. All the action, all the giant robots, all the forth-wall breaking jokes, all the shameless puns, and none of the censored footage (the KNT DVD is over there) is here. Watching this is like getting a perfect sugar rush; you're giddy for hours afterward. Samurai Pizza Cats arrives on DVD with 12 episodes new to the U.S. Finally the story of ""The Gender-Bender Butterflies"" as well as the origins of Polly's flute and the gang's encounter with the New York Pizza Cats can be told.

Tech specs:
The episodes look and sound (Dolby Mono only) like they did when they first aired in the 90's. No remastering. Two of the episodes (""Gender-Bender Butterflies"" and ""Gone with the Ginsu"") appear to be converted from PAL masters, resulting in them looking particularly jerky. There are no subtitles or closed captioning; unfortunate but predictable due to Discotek's aversion to dubtitles.

Bonus features: None, unless you count the 12 new-to-America episodes. Behind-the-scenes stuff about how a relatively straight-laced Japanese action cartoon became a gag-a-minute fest (the translated scripts were apparently of questionable quality)  would have been nice.",1402790400,3,1208,5.31413612565445

8642478,4,B00IJ4SFA6,"I am going to refrain from reviewing the anime itself for the most part, but I will say it is a solid 3 stars out of 4. In many ways, it feels unfinished, but what you get is high quality, and everything that it sets out to do, it does decently well.

This release, however... Does not. As you can see from the attached photos, the set contains 2 DVDs, and the first disc is in an insert... Which is white. The box is entirely black. But the insert is pure white, and cheap plastic. I had to replace it (final photo provided) just so it made sense.

This is the official release. And for this price, for a mere 13 episodes on 2 discs, I didn't expect them to cut corners as egregious as this. As a collector, I am disappointed. But the anime mostly makes up for the poor design.

Mostly.",1505606400,,787,4.130718954248366

8642481,5,B00IJ4SFA6,This is a good anime not a blood as you would think but good,1456099200,,60,3.357142857142857
8642482,5,B00IJ4SFA6,"Such a great idea for an anime.  If your drive to live is strong enough you can come back as a zombie. You make a deal with a ferryman & you have a year to pay off your debt, by which you can return to life. If not, you take your rightful place with the dead. It's too bad that a second season never came out though. They could have taken it to so many fun & interesting places. Unfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger. But, It's an anime I still love.",1454371200,,451,3.902173913043478
