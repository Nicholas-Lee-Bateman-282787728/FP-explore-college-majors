I have thick straight long hair and decided to implement the hot roller tips from Charles Dujic.  I loved the result and took a photo to use on my marketing pieces, one of which is a monthly newsletter I have been sending to all my clients for the past several years.  I was so amazed when no less than 5 of my clients took the time out of their busy day to call me to tell me how great my new hair style looked!  Thank YOU Charles!!!
