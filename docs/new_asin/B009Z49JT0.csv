8545534,5,B009Z49JT0,The movie was wonderful. The scenery from Italy was beautifully shot. The story was sad but with a message of forgiveness that I think is very important especially in these troubled times.,1418169600,,188,4.90625

8545536,3,B009Z49JT0,"This movie is based on an historical event and should have more oomph! If it had a bigger budget, better stars, a better director it could have been killer.",1378512000,,156,4.413793103448276
8545537,5,B009Z49JT0,"I got my husband this movie, that he had been wanting for months, for Fathers Day.  As soon as he opened it, he dropped everything and popped it in the dvd player immediately.  I got him the Italian version, so I didn't understand all of it, but he really loved this movie, and I liked it a lot, too.  We were both wiping tears out of our eyes at certain points, and at the end.  He even called his sister and his brother right after watching the movie, to talk about it.  It was a great story, very touching and emotional.",1373587200,,523,4.138613861386139
8545538,5,B009Z49JT0,I brought this movie because of Sean Kanan.  He's an amazing actor and the story was great.  Mike and Nabila's love story was so sweet but I did not expect the ending and that's all I'll say.  I'm very happy that I brought this and I recommend checking it out.  You won't be disappointed.,1354492800,4,288,4.277777777777778
8545539,5,B009Z49JT0,I just saw this movie last night and it was wonderful. The cast was brilliant with their acting.  The writing was well written. I cried at the end because something unexpected happened(can't give it away). Sean Kanan always delivers the Best and he's the main reason why i bought this movie since he's in it=)  Loved his Italian accent and acting.  He's phenomenal!,1353196800,3,365,4.761904761904762
