4511241,5,B00501LNOG,"This is my favorite Jari Love workout!  I've been wanting a great intense cardio program and this is it!  You have the option of weights or cardio or both, on my off day this is a fabulous cardio.  I just received my dvd and couldn't wait to try it, I was not disappointed!  I have not done the weight training yet, that has to wait until tomorrow, but I am sure it will not disappoint!!  LOVE IT!
52 yr old female.

I have now worked out to the whole dvd.  It is amazing.  Jari is motivational and right on.  I have had to turn the volume down on some of her dvd's but you will want to hear everything she says on this one!  The workout is easily modified to your level and ability but you will have fun working up to the level Jari and her team are at.  My modifications still give me a tremendous workout.  I believe I am finally going to kick menopause in the butt and lose weight and get fit with this workout!  Thank you Jari Love!!!",1324339200,10,939,4.065573770491803
4511242,5,B00501LNOG,"Jari Love's 1000 Hardcore is intense.  If you are up to the challenge, the long ""Complete Workout"" will certainly ""burn up to 1,000 calories"" from your body.  I actually felt thinner and depleted after doing my workout.

It's so hard to stay motivated in the winter but Jari and her team do an amazing job keeping my energized!

Lots of modifications. Great full body workout. As with most of her recent videos, I wish there were more workouts. Very happy to add this dvd to my workout regimen.",1466380800,,333,4.138461538461539

I've  bought all of her dvds cause I love the original get ripped series.  Sadly I haven't  been able to get excited about any of her dvds sine the original ripped and chiseled.  All the original get ripped videos are always in my rotation,  but all the other are collecting dust.",1437782400,,385,4.263888888888889
4511268,5,B00501LNOG,"This will leave you breathless!! It is a tough workout, even for advance workout people. I sweat buckets when I do this workout and I've done it tens of times and I'm an advanced workout person. As, with many of Jari's videos, the take consists of 2 workouts and you can string together for a tough, tough workout. Go heavy on the weights and you'll really feel it. I can't say, I look forward to doing it but it's really effective. It's very rewarding when you're done. If you are intermediate or beginner, use less weights and go with the modifications that Jari suggests. She has modifier dancers in the background so you can always follow those dancers.",1429574400,,657,4.576271186440678
4511269,4,B00501LNOG,"I have all of the 1000 workouts...this one is the hardest; especially the the fast pace jumping up and down on the step.  I can do 95% of the other 1000 workouts, but this will take me lots of using to get used to it.",1425686400,,217,3.8222222222222224

4511272,2,B00501LNOG,Just not my cup of tea. I found this video VERY boring. The # of moves are very limited and she simply does high reps. I swear to you that I began to get glazed over midway into the first 30 min section. The workout is effective just so very repetitive. I also did not burn anywhere near 1000 cal. I do not have a step so that may contribute to my limited burn of only 505 cal for the entire video. I think this video is good for someone who likes limited moves and is ok with a dark set and rather muted music.,1409616000,,511,3.876190476190476
4511273,5,B00501LNOG,This is the hardest ripped workout so far.  Definitely not for the beginner.  It does have some variety in the exercises compared to her other videos.,1409011200,,150,4.730769230769231
4511284,5,B00501LNOG,"I've purchased other programs including p90x3...something about them just didn't fit. This was perfect. I am 5'2 130-133lb female, looking to lose 15lbs. I'm a former dancer and was looking for something easy on the knees, not to much running (I loathe running) and this fit the bill...maybe a little too well.

I've been doing this workout 1 for a month now (maybe 2x/week) and I'm still not doing every rep/I'm taking longer breaks etc. Oh, and that's w/o risers... Gash, this DVD is tough! Lol, in a good way. There are plenty of reasons why I think this is a good DVD that works. However, let me tell me you why, this will now be a favorite-a ""never-fail-go-to"" type of thing.

""... I want you to feel success."" -Jari Love

""You have to move it to lose it"" -JL

""I'm so glad you're here doing this with us. It's no fun doing it on our own."" - JL

Usually that last comment is my cue to stop gasping for dear life and get 'er done! But that's because I'm usually exaggerating my level of tiredness. Although, I'm also usually drenched by then with sweat caught in the crease of my eye, glasses falling off and the like but who knows.

Point is, Jari, in the most soothing and simplest way really encourages you to stick to your guns. It helps tremendously that the movement is (IMO) relatively easy on your knees and as long as your working, you work up a good sweat.

This combination makes it a winner in my book. With all the different workouts available, it'll be a while before I need to switch to another, making it healthy for my wallet too. ;)

PS-just a side note, I'd suggest you hold the stretches longer than they do in the video or simply include an additional stretch routine of your own at the end specifically focusing on your hammies. Good luck!",1408752000,4,1765,4.409230769230769

4511288,5,B00501LNOG,"I bought this when it first came out and hated it!  Too many repetitions made it seem boring to me.  Well, it is now a couple years later and after sitting basically unused it is rapidly becoming a favorite.  The reason?  It is effective!  I think it may be the toughest workout dvd that I have!  I'm also wondering if perhaps one reason I disliked it so much initially is because it is so tough.  For some reason I'm not minding the endless reps as much as I once did, finding it challenging to make it through them and feeling like I've really conquered the world when I am finished.  I am definitely dripping when I am finished and know that the half hour I put in was not just a waste of time in my quest for being fit.",1400716800,3,723,4.114285714285714

4511290,4,B00501LNOG,"I really enjoy Jari Love DVDS and I do have a couple. I actually like this one, it's easy and simple basic moves. I feel her focus changed to more easier workouts because her older DVDs were harder workouts, heavier weights (I believe she was using 20 pounds for deadlifts and squats) but I noticed her newer workouts she uses 10 pounds the most. I mean, I am not complaining, I love working out and she is usually in my rotation along with Billy Blanks and Cathe, :)",1397952000,,467,4.318181818181818
4511291,5,B00501LNOG,I have all of Jari's DVD's.  I have been doing her DVD's for the past 5 years.  They deliver! This particular DVD is tough but what a work out ! Highly recommend !,1394323200,,163,3.909090909090909
4511292,5,B00501LNOG,"I have at least 20 exercise DVD's and this one is one of the most difficult to complete in that it really works up a good muscle burn as well as a great sweat and it is so nice to see the blank screen for a few seconds at the end of the workout and before the cooldown! I have several of Jari's Ripped and Extremely Ripped DVDs as well as her Bootcamp (it's tough too). I find this DVD to be a whole lot of cardio, great heart racing cardio. The straddle run (6 sets) is difficult and gets the heart racing if you do the three exercises in that set for six sets! The side lunge/curtsey lunge sets not only get your heart rate up but you will feel the burn in your thighs! This DVD not only requires physical endurance but mental as well (I have to keep telling myself I can do it...I can get through it...tough, tough, tough)! Personally, I like all of Jari's videos and each one has something I like over the others but this is definitely Hardcore. I have done the entire 73+ minute workout a few times and I have also done the 30 minute cardio...and the first 30 minute workout...and although after 73 minutes I am especially beat, even after a 30 minute workout, I feel it! It doesn't take long with Jari to break out into a sweat and when I'm short on time, the 30 minute workouts do not disappoint. I also think that her other videos focus more equally on lower body and upper body than this one. This one is definitely a tough lower body workout with a whole lot of cardio. As with her other DVD's, Jari encourages you to keep going but take water breaks or a longer recovery period if you need to just as she suggests. You  might just need to with this one!",1391990400,2,1664,4.167701863354037
4511293,4,B00501LNOG,I have been a fan of Jari's for years.  This workout really gets your heart rate up and you really feel like you are getting a complete workout. The different exercise sessions are awesome as you never get bored.,1391126400,,212,4.435897435897436
4511294,5,B00501LNOG,"This is one of the best workout DVDs I've ever purchased. I love it so much that when it broke I bought another one. The exercises are hard but its such a good cardio workout. You can chose to do the cardio, the weights or the whole thing. And Jari is so comforting with the way she leads the exercises. This will definitely get you in shape and continue to challenge you even once you get fit.",1390780800,,394,4.12987012987013
4511295,5,B00501LNOG,"I love this gal.  I have almost all of her work out dvds.  I'm a beginner exerciser, so this really helped me and you work up a sweat!  I highly recommend it.",1389830400,,158,3.875
4511296,1,B00501LNOG,"Not as organized as I would have liked.  Before each segment, you are not told what weight of dumb bell to use.  You have to wait until she start the segments to figure out what size dumb bells are being used.  After the segment starts then you are shown what dumb bell you should be using, that is after the segment has already started.
Some of the camera angles are not the best, especially at the start of the segments when you want to get the correct form for the exercise.",1388275200,2,477,4.21978021978022
4511297,5,B00501LNOG,"I am a certified instructor and also an advanced exerciser who enjoys high-rep workouts, and have done a TON of DVDs. Some of my favorite instructors are Amy Dixon, Angie Gorr and Cathe. I think Jari is also one of the BEST instructors out there. She is on the quiet-side as far as it comes to instructors and some reviews mentioned that they didn't like this. However, if you give her a chance and do the DVD a few times, you will actually find her VERY motivating! She always uses a positive form of encouragement. Jillian typically uses the hard-core approach, but Jari really helps you through when the sets get very tough. As far as DVDs go, you have to find an instructor you like, but you also have to mix it up (not just by the DVD from the same instructor) but by trying out new instructors as well.

Now...with that said, there are also 'types' of workouts that you will either like or not like. This DVD is VERY repetitive. For me, I love repetition, but if you are the kind that can't do 6 of the same drills in a row, then this DVD is not for you. However, if you are typically used to high-weights and low reps, give this High-rep concept a try because it is good to mix it up. I did find some of the cardio drills a little boring towards the last 2 sets, but because I was breathing so hard, I was able to push it through. The tricep step off to the side is a great move and really dug into my glutes. Jari uses a lot of combo moves which really get the heart rate up.

This DVD WILL burn a ton of calories. For those of you who want more of a challenge, you can add heavier weight and add a step. I have done a few other Jari videos, and this is one of my favorites. Her first 1000 video is really great for beginners and intermediate (but don't be fooled, it will still work you!) However, her first 1000 one has less cardio and more weights, the 2nd one is kind of balanced, and with this one I felt it kept my heart rate elevated the entire time where the first 1000 DVD had more heart rate peaks and valleys.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1384214400,7,2058,4.14
4511298,3,B00501LNOG,I've only done the two basic workouts and they are OK.  I find the routines a bit confusing and hard to follow.  Some demonstrations or graphics to follow would have been helpful,1381708800,,178,4.53125

For the rest of us, we're happy with our measly 400-600. But seriously, it is a challenging workout (I hate the burpees, which means they must be good for me), but one that I am training myself to get used to.

I don't necessarily like the cardio segments- a bit boring for me.  I just add more moves or supplement tougher moves in for hers.  The cardio seems a little boring if you are used to Cathy's step aerobics or Insanity/ Turbo Fire's floor aerobics.  You're not gonna get as good of a burn.  Not a HIIT style workout.

At first I thought Jari was kind of annoying, but I've decided I like her.  What I don't care for is when near the end she turns it over to this Laurie woman.  Her voice just annoys me like crazy.  Some of the cardio circuits feel like they'll go on forever, but they're so good they're bound to provide definition and tweak your body.  This is definitely a step or more up from the standard Jillian dvd's, so if you want to take it to the next level, this is it!",1359331200,,719,4.014084507042254

I like that you can do just the cardio workout, just the strength training workouts, or the combination workouts.  They aren't as long as some others out there which is important for me since I have a toddler and need to get in my workout and get going to my other responsibilities.

I like that modifications are offered and that in the beginning of each segment they tell you how many reps and sets you'll be doing.  For me, it helps me mentally make it through set 3, knowing there are only 4 sets, for example.  My only wish was that there were different ab segments. The same two ab segments are used for each combination workout.

Like some other viewer said, it's very repetitive - I didn't think it'd bother me but it did... you do 6 sets for almost every move and each set is lengthy, so it kinda put me off as I was looking for variations, working in different areas.

In her cool down section, she didn't stretch the upper body at all, which surprised me as there were a lot of shoulder workouts.

It's still a good workout though",1352592000,2,509,4.183673469387755
4511315,2,B00501LNOG,"This video will provide a hard workout, but it is very high impact. There is a lot of jumping in every segment! Anyone with joint issues should avoid this one. And though you can modify, if you are modifying almost every activity, your workout will suffer. Also, maybe I did not read carefully enough to know that to do the program to its fullest potential, you need an aerobic step. I do not have one and do not want to get one. I did the workouts without the step and it was odd. You can pretend to have a step, but it throws things off. Finally, the routine is boring. She does the same exercise for as many as five sets per side--way too much for my attention span.

4511322,5,B00501LNOG,"This is by far my favorite workout from Jari from her Ripped 1000. She is very encouraging and keeps you going even though you are sweating buckets and feeling all the muscles working that you forgot you had. Not to be gross but I looked down and the front of my legs were dripping sweat. That is intense!!!  I made it through THE ENTIRE WORKOUT but PAUSED it most of the time between each segment.  There is something about this workout that makes me think she is really getting at all the muscles, at every angle, and in new ways that are particularly effective for a womens body.  The choreography is simple but not boring. Some peopleseem to find it boring, but I did not.  This is probably the most intense workout I have done, and I have Insanity and a lot of Cathe, Bob Harper, Amy Dixon, Michelle Dozois PeakFit Challenge set.  If you are up for the most challenging and effective workout that will shred your body in no time, and you are tired of wasting time with workouts that do nothing, buy this!!!!

The workout is intense, but she also has modified versions of the cardio moves.  I can only use this DVD every other day, but it has definitely made a difference!",1339977600,,324,4.193548387096774
4511324,4,B00501LNOG,"I have tried a variety of Jillian Michael's, Jackie Warner and Bob Harper DVD's as well as a variety of free on demand workouts.  This was the first time I have heard of or tried a Jari Love workout DVD.  I wanted something that focused on weights AND cardio without it feeling too 1980's aerobic-ee.  I have to say of my three favorite DVD's this is going to be one of them.

Compared to Jillian Michael's:

Pro's: Jeri is more pleasantly positive... less in your face than Jillian.  Some people want the hard core personality but sometimes, just a positive friendly personality is easier for me to work with at the end of the day.

Con's: Jari doesn't focus a whole lot on form, which Jillian does so this DVD would not be one that I choose on its own or for a first time workout DVD.

Compared to Jackie Warner:

Pro's: Even though you can choose a 30 minute workout with both of the DVD's i have, the warm up and cool down don't cut into the workout time of 30 minutes with the Jari Love video.  Also, if you need to change weights, Jari gives you time to do that, where the Jackie Warner video's don't give you time to change the amount of weight you are using when you need to.

Con's: Jari doesn't focus as much on the modifications as Jackie does, though there is a person doing them.  She just doesn't give you a first overall explanation or view of the modifications before they start working out.  But, that didn't really effect my work out too much.  After you see or try the video once, the modifications are pretty intuitive.

I like this workout DVD as part of my workout regimen for a nice well rounded workout experience.  I would definitely purchase more Jari Love DVD's.",1337040000,5,1689,4.382636655948553
4511325,4,B00501LNOG,"I like this workout a lot. I will say if you have bad knee's this is not the workout for you. It's really tough on that area with a lot of lunges. Also I really wish there was a better variation of exercises, it gets pretty boring repeating them over and over. I will say it's a high energy level workout. So be prepared to keep moving.",1336608000,3,336,4.029850746268656
4511326,5,B00501LNOG,"Buy it. It is an amazing workout. I own 4 Jillian Michaels workouts, 1 biggest loser, Turbo Jam, P90X and a few other random ones. This one is better than ALL OF THEM. The workouts are the perfect length, they have several modifications for each move, plus - no ridiculous jokes or annoying phrases that will grind on your nerves. This is a keeper and I will be purchasing MANY more of her workouts. LOVE.",1333411200,8,405,4.413333333333333
4511327,4,B00501LNOG,"I've been using Jari Love's workouts for a few years now and I have to say that this ""Hardcore"" and the ""Boot Camp"" workouts are my favorite. I love her workouts because she always comes out with new moves that kick my butt. This workout can be modified for beginners, but I think you have to have ""the bug"" to use her workouts - beginners might think it's boring, but the many reps are what get results. I just got the ""hardcore"" workout recently but I love it - and love the ""Boot Camp"" workout as well. I appreciate how she gets down to business and doesn't waste time talking, like some dvds do. Before the ""Great Recession"" I was lucky enough to work with a personal trainer - Jari Love's workouts are the closest thing I've found, because with my current financial situation, a personal trainer (or a health club membership) is not an option for me. Thank you, Jari, for your excellent work.",1332115200,3,897,4.442424242424242

4511329,5,B00501LNOG,"Good workout video, but not my favorite JL one; similar to the others, and a good circuit trainng workout. Wish it had a little aerobic thrown in. I do a Jari video at least once a week with my other workouts. They're all good!",1332115200,,227,4.181818181818182
4511330,4,B00501LNOG,"I have several of Jari's workouts.  Anything in the Get Ripped series is great, the others are not.  The main difference is the intervals are longer but instead of doing level 1, 2, and finishing with 3 they are repeating throughout the interval.  So you do level 1, 2, and 3 and repeat the order between 3 and 6 times.  Some reviews complain about it but I think it depends what you are in the mood for.

Toughest for me are the burpees, curtsy lunges, and the first abs - Jari leads it but tells you Laurie developed it and I can understand why she doesn't want the credit - it's intense!

I deducted one star for the production.  I think it's easier when they keep the camera mostly still like in the other Get Rippeds.  It moves around too much and when you are first learning the moves it makes it harder to follow and looks less professional in my opinion.

All in all this is a very tough and satisfying workout that I highly recommend!!",1330732800,2,944,4.288135593220339
4511331,3,B00501LNOG,"I loved Extremely Ripped 1000 and found that to be the perfect mix between weights and cardio. In the cardio sections you can go up the three levels of intensity, put in as much effort as you can, and then the weights section gives you time to get your breath back while working the muscles. Therefore, I was very excited to see ER1000 Hardcore.
However... It just doesn't seem as good to me. One other reviewer talked about the amount of repetition. I didn't think that would bother me, but now that I've tried it, it does. Six sets of each moves just seems too much. Also, some of the moves seem quite rushed. I've got a smaller step than Jari's so I was having to keep half an eye on where I was putting my feet - I was worried about slipping off from jumping up and down it so quickly. This may seem a silly point, but I didn't have that worry at all with ER1000. Some people may enjoy the DVD, and it did bring me out in a sweat, but I just don't think it'll be on regular rotation for me.",1330214400,18,994,4.102564102564102

4511334,5,B00501LNOG,"The reason I really like this workout is because it alternates between cardio and weights. It gives me a chance to catch my breath and cool down, while also working on my strength! But there is also an option to do just the cardio portion of the DVD, which I have been doing lately because I like to do my own strength training, as it is more advanced. The cardio is great, gets me sweating, and it's defnintely not as daunting or boring as a long run. Jari Love is an excellent trainer because she is very warm and kind in encouraging viewers, instead of being too tough or mean. She also places an emphasis on the fact that it's okay if you can't finish the exercise or need to take it down to the first level. We can't all be perfect and finish a difficult circuit, and she understands that!",1329868800,2,794,4.264900662251655
4511335,5,B00501LNOG,"This is the best workout that Jari Love has done yet.  I love the fact that it shows what exercise you will be doing and how many sets of each.  This is an intense workout and it helps to know that the end is in sight for some of the more difficult moves.

One suggestion that I have is that Jari let the viewers know if they will be staying on one leg for the entire set.  In some of her previous DVDs, she would just say that you can work out one side and then the other so when I did this the first time, I alternated legs on the first part of the workout when she really did work out both sides equally.

Overall, this is one of my favorite workout DVDs.  You really feel like you have worked when you are done and that you have accomplished something by getting through the DVD.  I hope that her future DVDs follow the same format.",1329609600,4,836,4.0

I read some reviews on this DVD, watched a couple of videos so thought I would give it a try. This dvd takes exercising to a whole new level. It is definitely not for the beginner - more of a workout for the already incredibly fit. You really feel like you have worked out the next day. The DVD also allows for progression (increasing the intensity) when you become comfortable/improved strength and stamina when working out to this DVD over a while.

I would definately recommend this DVD. Jari is very professional and the moves are safe enough to do... highly recommended.",1328400000,2,731,4.455223880597015
4511339,5,B00501LNOG,I have almost all of Jari Love's DVDs. Some I love and keep on a frequent rotation. Other's I don't like at all. This is my second favorite of all her exercise video's. My top favorite is still the Extremely Ripped 1000. That is such a perfect combination of high energy cardio and weight segements that move so fast you never have a chance to get bored. This workout is now my second favorite of hers and it perfect to mix up my workouts and provide variety. I like that the cardio segments and weight segments are longer as it provides a new variety for her.

Now, that I've been alternating between the shorter workouts for the last couple of weeks, I don't get sore anymore.  Also, I can see that my strength and endurance is improving significantly.  Pretty soon, I'll be ready to do the full length workout.  Compared to many of the fitness dvds you find in stores (Target, Walmart etc...), this is definitely hardcore.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1327017600,2,710,4.407692307692308
4511342,5,B00501LNOG,"This workout is the third ""1000"" workout in Jari Love's ripped series.  In the full workouts, intense cardio work is alternated with strength training.  In this workout, a 5 minute cardio routine is alternated with a 3 minute strength training superset that targets multiple muscle groups.  There is nothing particularly novel about the exercises chosen, they are mostly well put together classics.  The cardio contains between 4-6 sets of a series of exercises that build in intensity.  The cardio series is relatively basic- no complicated or dancey type moves and as a dance clutz, I had no trouble picking up the moves.  Each set of cardio contains three levels of intensity and as you move through the set the intensity builds.  A beginner can choose to stay with the lower intensity workout until stamina improves.  The high intensity moves did have quite a lot of high impact exercises.  The strength training series targeted all the major muscle groups.

Equipment wise, this workout requires hand weights and a step.  Cueing is done well (much better than in some of the recent releases from the Ripped Series).  These folks are fitness professionals, not models, and all of them have excellent form.  This workout seems better produced than some of the other ones in the series.  There are three workout options (1) complete workout, (2) cardio only, or (3) strength training only.

These are serious workouts that will improve both strength and cardio endurance. This workout is challenging enough for advanced exercisers but also has enough modifications that a beginner/intermediate could use this and work there way up. Because this targets both cardio and strength training, this would be an effective workout for any one seeking to lose weight or increase physical fitness.  This workout would appeal to someone who enjoys Bob Harper, Cathe, Jackie Warner, and Amy Dixon.",1325203200,40,1887,5.117647058823529
4511343,5,B00501LNOG,"Just received yesterday! Went through the cardio only option, and it was really a great workout!

Jari takes you through each move with different levels of intensity. She is a very positive trainer and gives good cues. I am sure this burned a few hundred calories, and be warned - it is very intense, especially for your legs if you do the hardest moves. I did this after my normal workout, so moving forward I would recommend it be used as a stand-alone workout! Yes, my legs are feeling it today!

Also a note on the interval training - it is a good mix of low to high intensity and I really like the fact that she uses the latest science in developing her routines.

The music was great and keeps you moving. Not too annoying and at the right volume level.

I'll be doing the weight training option soon, but if all it had was the cardio workout it would be well worth the price and then some! Would highly recommend this DVD!

UPDATE: I have done the entire workout twice now (and the shorter sections a few times). My calorie burned was at 995 and 953 for the entire workout, so the 1000 calories is a very realistic number!",1324425600,35,1129,4.331753554502369

Two reasons, the first one being that the cardio is SO FREAKING BORING. The moves are generic, and they last much longer than can hold my attention. It makes me hate doing it, and subsequently makes the workout go very slowly. Plus, the weight segments are way too short, resulting in almost not being felt at all. Jari has some good ones out there, but there are some I have grown out of, and those like this one that I just cannot see coming back to. The cardio is mind-numbingly boring and it's not worth it to me, even if you could get ripped from it.
