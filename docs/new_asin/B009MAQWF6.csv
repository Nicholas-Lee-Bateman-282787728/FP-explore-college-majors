8612872,5,B009MAQWF6,"Gundam Age is a very good way to tell a story about Gundams, Its different from the other series, although it still about war but the main story revolves around family. This series contains 3 generations of the Asuno family, who designed and built the Gundams. I like it very much and its definitely a must see Anime.",1407369600,,317,4.482758620689655
