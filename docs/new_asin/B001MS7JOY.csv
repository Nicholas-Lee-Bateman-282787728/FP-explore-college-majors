8321605,3,B001MS7JOY,"This video is extremely short, but it gives an ok introduction.  I think they have some good information, but I prefer Power Striking by mike andreula for my workout.  If the Academy comes out with a longer dvd, I will try it.",1285286400,,226,4.357142857142857
8321606,1,B001MS7JOY,"not worth the money. there are better videos that display proper form.

8321607,1,B001MS7JOY,"well, a bit disappointing, not much here to see and learn. I was hooked by great videos on youtube, which also to be found on this dvd. But, not much more than this. Stance, elbows, foot jab, kicks, 4xcombinations and 2xtesting. Alltogether, perhaps 15min of footage.",1237248000,7,267,4.826086956521739
