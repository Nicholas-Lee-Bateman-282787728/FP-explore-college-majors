2662819,5,B000IQYP98,"Beautiful!  I have found it truly inspirational and joyous to watch this collection.  As an author, designer, and illustrator, I find inspiration from many elements.  There are inspirational gems in the songs sung by Judy Garland and in the arrangements of Mort Lindsey that I fill my mind with and draw from when creating.  It's more about what I'm ""SEEING"" as a designer/creator than what I'm seeing or hearing regarding the actual program or music.  Disc 1 features a reunion with Mickey Rooney, where Mickey hams it up on the drums to have this author laughing joyously with glee.  Very, very funny!  (This scene has Judy singing a love song over Mickey's antics.  Judy just wants to laugh along with everyone else when she catches a glimpse of Mickey.  Classic!)  If you would like to see the creative result of being inspired, energized, enkindled, animated, quickened by jazz, swing, and big band music, then view the illustrations and design in my Art & Design / How-To book, Cartoon Design Revealed, by visiting this Amazon.com page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Design-Revealed-Kristian-Andrew-Sather/dp/1478710217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Design Revealed Kristian Andrew Sather</a>&nbsp;One never knows where inspiration will come from, when a joyous event will enter ones life, however, it's pretty near a guarantee that when the first song from this collection is heard and when Judy Garland is seen on your TV screen or device (especially when Judy sings ""Ol' Man River"" at the end of Disc 1), you will understand, you will know.  Enjoy!",1376179200,2,1615,5.524390243902439
2662820,5,B000IQYP98,"Judy Garland was the greatest singer of the 20th Century. And Tony Bennett said that himself and I and a million other people agree..This set contains three complete shows from her TV series. Although why they (whoever) chose these particuler shows I don't know. Not that their bad. Their very good in fact. I just wonder why they were chosen. I am waiting for the day when there is one complete set of The Judy Garland Show on her one and only season.  This is a good sample of her amazing talent and it will make others wonder why, oh why her show was cancelled. The show and Judy herself should have been taken care of better than this. But we know that this is legend of how Judy got messed over .But we do have this one precious season and it should be taken care of. When can we expect a Blu-ray version of her complete series?",1360972800,4,833,4.272151898734177
2662821,5,B000IQYP98,It was a great show. Too bad those execs canceled her just to be cruel just because they could. She made millions for execs but they took her. Then everyone wonders why she needed those drugs that killed her to ease her excessive pain they caused.,1354665600,,247,4.391304347826087
2662822,3,B000IQYP98,"In 1963, all three major TV networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) had a bidding war to sign the incomparable Judy Garland to a weekly musical-variety series. Having won, CBS, under the leadership of president Mike Dann, did everything conceivable to dilute Judy's potent performance power; transforming her from a powerhouse diva to an ""average"" TV personality. The show went through countless directors, producers, and format changes in its all too brief 26 episodes. Whatever changes were thrown at her, Judy adapted to the circumstances, rolled with the punches, and consistently gave her very best-- proving that nothing could diminish her once in a lifetime talent. The three episodes collected here (the fourth disc consists of ""out-takes"") illustrate what went occasionally right and more often terribly wrong with ""The Judy Garland Show"":
  DISC 1: The first episode, taped in June of 1963, finds everyone in high spirits (the troubles had not yet begun) as Judy is paired with her frequent MGM co-star Mickey Rooney. The ""Dynamic Diva Judy"" is seen full force here; belting out thrilling renditions of ""When The Sun Comes Out"" and ""Old Man River."" When Mickey and Judy chat about the old days at MGM, she remarks, ""I wish the MGM executives had been nice when they fired me."" For some reason, CBS chose a later episode with Donald O'Connor as the premiere episode in September. By the time this ""Judy and Mickey"" episode finally did air in December, Mike Dann had decided to cancel the show, despite previously promising Judy a four year comitment.
  DISC 2: This episode, pairing Judy with guests Jack Carter, George Maharis, and The Dillards, is upsetting, to say the least. What are hillbilly/bluegrass band The Dillards doing on the same show with Judy Garland? The ""jokes"" offered by comedian Jack Carter, including some awful ones at Judy's expense (""this is the fourth Judy Garland-- the original one went over the rainbow years ago"") , are in extremely bad taste. George Maharis sings an appropriate moody-melancholy rendition of ""Goodbye."" But his later interaction with Judy is so physically intimate and  ""touchy-feely"", it is uncomfortable to watch. At the end, Judy jokingly refers to herself as ""a little old lady.""
  DISC 3: This high-voltage combination of Judy and Bobby Darin easily makes this  the best episode in the collection. Judy kicks things off with fantastic renditions of ""Hello, Bluebird"" and ""Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart."" Bob Newhart offers some light comedy. And Bobby Darin proves he is just as explosive as Judy with his two intense solos. But the highlight is definitely  Judy and Bobby Darin's lengthy duet/medley of ""traveling songs.""
  DISC 4: consists of ""out-takes"" and unaired material.  The heavy emotional toll the series took on Judy is evident, as her insecurities show. Judy sings a wonderful version of Jule Styne's ""Time After Time."" But, just as she reaches the finish, she stops herself and says she wants to do it over. Simalarly, she sings a superb version of Irving Berlin's ""Suppertime"" and suddenly  stops and says, ""I'm sorry. I ran out of gas."" Dressed as a clown, Judy offers a stark, unsettling pantomine as an off-camera chorus sings ""Where Is The Clown?"" The unaired finale to the series is even more disturbing. Still dressed in clown make-up and costume, an obviously heartbroken and distraught Judy sings ""Here's To Us"" as she passes  champagne to audience members. She gives a game, valient effort to prove once again that the show MUST go on. But it is painfully obvious that the thoughtless and cruel cancellation of ""The Judy Garland Show"" was the beginning of the end for Judy Garland, the person.",1266883200,22,3673,5.009852216748769
2662823,1,B000IQYP98,"Buyer beware: don't jump to buy this if you're looking for a comprehensive or exemplary collection of Judy Garland Show programs. You'd do better to select the individual programs that interest you.  This is NOT the complete set of all 26 Judy Garland Show programs (some sellers will give you this impression). There are only THREE programs on four discs (not counting the so-called bonus material).  These are hardly the cream of the crop either.  There are photos on the package of Judy with Liza Minnelli, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra and Lena Horne, NONE of whom are included on the discs (Dean and Frank never guested on the program at all).  The package doesn't tell you which programs they are (other than mentioning the guests Bobby Darin, George Maharis, Bob Newhart, Jack Carter, Leo Durocher and The Dillards). You can do the math by finding online program guides. Extremely disappointing and unnecessary.",1261094400,45,918,4.980392156862745
2662824,1,B000IQYP98,"I agree with the info in the first review. In addition, the dvds are said to be in color. FALSE. Also the supposed never before seen bonus outtakes were all on the Pioneer discs years ago. The pictures used are kinda dumb too, from all over Judy's career.
You only get what you pay for.",1260835200,24,286,4.218181818181818
2662825,3,B000IQYP98,"Bought The Judy Garland Show collection (2009) for a gift after being dizzified by the number of discontinued versions.  The box sets for Vols. I/II would run about $450, if they could be found, so when I came across the pre-release of this set, I thought this would replace those other collections.  I took a chance ordering this collection as there wasn't any real information as to the content besides the set containing 4 DVDs.  Compared to one of the box sets that had 7 DVDs and another that had 4 DVDs (I recall thinking they were double sided), I assumed that this remastered set was really the equivalent of 8 DVDs on 4 physical media discs.

There are NO liner notes and no indication of which shows are present.  The back of the box says 4 discs with three 47-minute shows plus bonus material.  The front cover indicated that there was a limited edition poster inside, but it's a cardboard postcard slightly smaller than the size of the DVD box.  The box indicates that there were 26 episodes of The Judy Garland Show, and going back and looking at the box sets for Vols. I/II most of those episodes are there (not here), and it's impossible to directly compare what's in this set with what is available in the more expensive discontinued sets.

Other than the minimal information on the content and the rather uninspired packaging and DVD menus, the price is likely right for those interested in simply watching the shows for enjoyment rather than adding this as a viable set for a real collector.  Giving this as a gift to someone who expected some history on the shows, or at least a table of contents, turned out to be a letdown.",1260316800,78,1644,4.5646258503401365
