8220086,5,B000VUHDCC,"You cannot beat these actors when it comes to telling a great story. After watching, ""Ballykissangel"", I decided to try something else with Stephen Tompkinson, and because I already love Robson Green, how could I go wrong? I highly recommend Season 1 & 2, as the honesty of the brother relationship is well acted and completely believable. Just love, love, love these 2 actors.",1399334400,,377,4.90625

8220091,5,B000VUHDCC,"Koch Vision and BBC presents ""GRAFTERS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON"" (2006) (400 mins/Color) (Dolby Digital) ---The Complete Second Season. This eight-episode series from 1999 puts the two geordie brothers in Brighton, where it's always sunny, but the water's getting too hot --- This British television show follows the exploits of two brothers who move from the North-East of England to London --- The brothers Robson Green and Stephen Tompkinson take a job renovating houses after arriving in the city, but their fractious relationship often threatens to tear them apart --- Grafters: The Complete Second Season is a real treat for fans of British TV who are looking for a fresh, fun, surprisingly emotional comedy, romance and drama --- The cast is outstanding, the writing is sharp and the direction is excellent.

Under the production staff of:
Steven Whittaker  - Director
David Thacker  - Director
Dominic Brigstocke - Director
Paul Harrison - Director
Yvonne Francas  - Producer
Richard Stoneman - Screenwriter
Annie Wood - Screenwriter
Andrew Rattenbury - Screenwriter
Colin Bytheway - Screenwriter
Shaun Prendergast  - Screenwriter

Story line and plot, Grafters has a lot of routine soapy moments, but also has some scenes that really click --- Take note as the scene in which a brawling Nick and Joe tumble out of Nick's office into the street to find Trevor and Clare kissing or the wine-and-cheese flat showing that goes perfectly wrong --- Wouldn't hire these guys to do a project for me --- They always find putting out romantic fires and doing battle with upper-class twits --- Can't see how they actually found the time to get any work done --- The construction trade does play a part in the story, since the brothers Purvis face obstacles like asbestos and bad wiring along with the obstacles created by the sleazy Nick Costello and their own romantic distractions.

the cast includes
Robson Green  - Joe Purvis
Stephen Tompkinson  - Trevor Purvis
Darren Morfitt  - Simon Purvis
Lesley Vickerage  - Viv Casey
Katherine Wogan  - Clare Costello
David Westhead  - Nick Costello

We enjoy British Television series, Ballykissagel, Monarch of the Glen, Hamish Macbeth and now the Grafters. I would recommend this for viewing to anyone in good British Televison comedy, to bad there is only two seasons?",1202342400,,289,4.918367346938775
