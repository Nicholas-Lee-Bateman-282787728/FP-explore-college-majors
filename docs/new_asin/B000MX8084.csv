8411028,5,B000MX8084,"A wonderful production detailing the trials and tribulations of a mostly volunteer effort to operate this tourist railway.  Very well done.  Excellent photography which includes interviews with a number of the folks involved in restoring this abandoned line, locomotives and cars to operating condition.  I first watched it as an instant video on ROKU from Amazon.  I enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD to add to my railroad DVD collection.  One of the best I've watched along this subject line. I've added a visit to this railway to my ""bucket list.""",1383696000,,553,4.903225806451613
