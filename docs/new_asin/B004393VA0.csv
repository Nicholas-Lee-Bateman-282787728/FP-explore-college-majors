4253710,3,B004393VA0,Sort of a slow  moving movie.  Had to watch it 2 times to get the plot correct.  Made you think but not too deeply.,1359676800,,115,3.7083333333333335
4253711,2,B004393VA0,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because I live in Wallingford and it was filmed here at our favorite pizza place, Trackside Pizza!",1358035200,,127,4.565217391304348
4253712,5,B004393VA0,"The story is off the beaten path (i.e. not Hollywood)  and makes you think -- athough not too logically.  It's more the feeling of it.  Plus, the soundtrack is cool, and the women are hot, so this movie meets all my requirements.",1356307200,3,229,4.404761904761905
4253713,5,B004393VA0,"Haunting of Amelia,
This is an excellent movie for those who are doubting life in general for whatever reason.
This movie can help them refocus if they are in lifes limbo or if they just want to watch a great movie.",1356220800,,215,4.2682926829268295
4253714,4,B004393VA0,"The dvd arrived on time and in excellent condition. The movie has a good plot towards the end, but the beginning of the plot is vague, I feel I'm at a lost to what's is going on with the story. I don't think there's any climax in the story or it is so subtle that I probably has missed it.",1346112000,,289,3.8333333333333335
4253715,5,B004393VA0,"Saw this on Showtime and loved it -- under its original name, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS. Had to buy the DVD. Wasn't really expecting anything and was surprised to find a cool independent film on a major cable network. The music was great and the haunting feel of the story made me want to snuggle up with my guy. Googled it and saw the film is a bit old. Not sure why its just coming out. Definitely the kind of movie you want to watch more than once. In fact I've already watched it twice. Lots of twists that put things in a diff perspective. Chad Lindberg is amazing. I love ghost stories but don't like too much blood and gore, so this was perfect for me. Haunting and suspenseful, but not too scary (well, except for one or two good ""jumps"" :) Recommend it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1296000000,14,805,4.26797385620915
4253716,5,B004393VA0,"I recently watched a trio of slow placed supernatural dramas: THE ECLIPSE (from Magnolia Pictures), HEREAFTER (Dir. Clint Eastwood), and this movie. This is a small indie re-branded as a horror movie for DVD. Not sure why? I dug around and found it's been playing on Showtime under the name, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS. To me that's a much better title given that there's no significant haunting going on here. Horror fans should look elsewhere. Despite that problem this was my favorite of the bunch mainly because of the virtual dreamland it creates out of small town America...beautiful lonely moments and imagery. Makes me pause and think about the afterlife.",1296000000,5,665,4.946428571428571
4253717,4,B004393VA0,"I was expecting THE HAUNTING OF AMELIA to be a horror flick when I first heard the title.  I watched this movie last night and it's kind of a slow paced movie.  I don't mean that in a bad way because looking back on the entire plot, it had to be slow or else it wouldn't have made sense.  I wouldn't necessarily say that it's my favorite movie but it was definitely worth seeing.  I give it four stars.",1294272000,2,402,4.050632911392405

4253720,3,B004393VA0,"The story was Awesome, not scary SAD. I enjoyed it the plot of this move can and dose happen in real life. What I mean by that is cars don't win, when they go up agonized locomotives. Some Spirits just can't move on, some just love life so much they can't see the lite.",1470355200,,269,4.0

4253743,1,B004393VA0,"This movie is neither scary or haunting - it's just plain awful.  I've seen better acting in high school plays.  I don't understand the good reviews here.  The movie is so disjointed - so many elements that are introduced, but never fully developed. The best part of the movie is last 10 minutes when the relationship of the 3 characters finally somewhat makes sense. Then 2 young, pretty girls are thrown into the mix, flirting and playing with each other throughout the movie and making out in their bikini's by the pool - probably in an attempt to keep some people's interest - even that failed horribly - just ridiculous and boring.  Don't waste your time on this dud.",1457222400,6,672,4.621848739495798

I did watch it all the way through, but I will not watch it again.  Thank you.",1456704000,4,250,3.5925925925925926

4253753,2,B004393VA0,I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed.  I expected much more.  It was pretty boring and slow for most of them movie.  The last few minutes were ok and finally made sense but overall I wouldnt recommend this to horror fans.  It is more of a drama - slow drama.,1456444800,3,263,4.098039215686274

4253757,3,B004393VA0,"I agree with another reviewer that the first half of this movie is tedious. Actually, the first 3/4/.

If you can make it to the end, the last 10 minutes are pretty good, even though it's very similar to
another, better known movie from years ago. It still works.

I'm just not sure those last 10 minutes are worth sitting through the whole thing. Make up your
own mind by giving it a look. Very much a chick movie.",1455753600,,415,4.2405063291139244
4253758,1,B004393VA0,such a bad movie.,1451606400,,17,3.5
4253759,3,B004393VA0,"I tried this movie because it was rated about 4 stars average.  Both my husband and I enjoy a good ghost movie and we tried to endure the movie and hoped for the great ending as was written by others to expect.  I don't want to give away any of the movie, because some may want to watch it and may find it enjoyable.  For us, it was just plain boring.  The plot twist they tried to make interesting was really pretty obvious and poorly done.  We didn't connect with the characters at all and honestly it left several questions unanswered.  Don't get your expectations up and maybe you will enjoy this movie but for us, I would say it was only okay, ,and just barely that.  If you haven't seen the move The Others, I would recommend watching that over this movie any day.  I am not a person to normally watch a movie more than once, but The Others I have watched twice and enjoyed it both times.",1451001600,3,894,4.2176470588235295
4253760,3,B004393VA0,If you make it to the end of this admittedly slow and at times confusing film you will be rewarded with a surprising twist ending that makes the rest of the film make sense. Good original music throughout. A haunting story that is more and finds the main character on a different plane. Unusual.,1449619200,,295,4.481481481481482
4253761,3,B004393VA0,"This movie is....different, I really don't know how to explain it without giving away the plot. I found the first half very tedious and was tempted to turn it off - don't, the ending will be worth it.  It is hard to review this movie without giving away any spoilers (and if you want spoilers, you can find them). I will say it is unique, not fabulous, but worth a viewing. And that's all I'll let on.",1435708800,4,401,4.207792207792208

4253763,1,B004393VA0,"I rented this movie because of the intriguing premise and the 4-star rating.  I have NO IDEA how this film got 4 stars.  The acting was so poor I had to turn it off after 20 minutes and I almost NEVER turn a film off once I've paid for it.  For me, it's one of those films where the acting is so bad it's PAINFUL to watch.  This isn't even a B movie much less a 4-star A movie, IMHO.  Try Eclipse (currently on Prime and superb; well cast), Lady in Black (also excellent; atmospheric) or My Ghost Story installments (also on Prime).  The Pact is also a B-ish but pretty decent ghost story with a punchy twist at the end.

I'm REALLY SORRY I paid a single cent for this movie -- save your $.  Very disappointing.",1412985600,,711,4.101449275362318

4253765,5,B004393VA0,"It is difficult to describe the feelings this movie left me with. I have watched it many times and each time i learn a little more about it's secret. The cast flows perfectly, Ms. Raymonde (Amelia) lets this movie stand alone from any other i have ever seen. The story line is put together with a great deal of thought and the music matches it perfectly.
  It takes you away to another place when you view it. The innocence is beyond comprehension and the place and time the movie was filmed will grab you. You become entranced with all of the elements...so much so you get lost in yourself and the gift of this film. When you view it give it a chance and see it more than once and the understanding of the story will come in time. This is a gifted writer/director (A.D Calvo) and i would like to see his other work but i believe this will remain his best work.  Kirt",1387497600,5,867,4.242424242424242
