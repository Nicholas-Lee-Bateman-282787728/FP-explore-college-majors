2858751,5,B000R5O01I,"If you have a real dark sense of humor and love the anti-holiday movies, this movie is up your alley.

There isn't anything really special about the Blu-Ray version (for those who already own Badder) but it was nice to have in a true high def sense.",1204588800,2,249,4.297872340425532
2858752,5,B000R5O01I,"Just bought the Blu-ray of this and highly recommend it. It includes the Director's Cut of the film which I especially enjoyed - I thought it was pretty great actually. Especially loved the scene they cut out of the Uncut Version that has Billy Bob popping what looks to be an amyl nitrate! I can see why the studio was uncomfortable with that, but c'mon, it was hilarious! Also Billy Bob smoking cigarettes with kids on his lap - very funny. The Director's Cut also got rid of some of the falsely sentimental scenes near the end predictably intended to win your heart -  like where Billy Bob is lighting candles for the Holiday season and so on and so forth. This crap was not missed and it's absence really improved the film for me. And of course the original ending is far superior. In a commentary track, Zwigoff and his editor explain how the Test Audience process had a hand in forcing his cut to be altered. I'm just glad I was able to see it finally like he meant it to be. I liked the version i saw in theaters but this Dircetor's Cut of Zwigoff's is a far superior film. Original, surprising, hilarious, and moving. Right up there with his other pictures ""GhostWorld"" and ""Crumb"" which are some of my favorite films. The picture and sound quality of the Blu-Ray is A+. I will be watching this every Christmas!

Director's Cut - Five Stars
Uncut Version - Four Stars",1201478400,8,1375,4.4523809523809526

2858764,5,B000R5O01I,The best christmas movie by far!!! This is one ofthe funniest movies ive ever seen. The unrated version is almost like the theatre version just with a few sex parts thown in there. Highly recommended on blu ray. Great quality,1387238400,,225,4.65
2858765,5,B000R5O01I,"this is a fav movie of ours and it never gets old. love that it's on blue ray, great quality",1386892800,,92,3.65
2858766,5,B000R5O01I,"Very funny, dirty jokes, but I watched 10 times and they don't get old!!! Santa is Bad as it can be !!! Some lines you won't forget!!!",1373241600,,134,4.0
2858767,5,B000R5O01I,One of my favorite movies. Buy the unrated version. It contains a lot of scenes not shown on TV obviously,1361145600,,105,4.3
2858768,5,B000R5O01I,"First, the movies is a 9.5/10 for me. It's an unbelievably hilarious dark Christmas comedy. Billy Bob Thornton, Bernie Mac and John Ritter (his last movie) were amazing. They truly push and control the movie. If you enjoy dark humor, you will love this movie. As for the disc itself, it's your typical BD. The picture transfer is great, as is the audio. You get two versions of the movie. I hadn't see the ""Director's Cut"" until I got this disc. It's not bad, but the UnRated Version is still the champ. Overall you will not regret buying this movie :)",1360540800,,552,4.475247524752476
2858769,5,B000R5O01I,I saw the theater version when it came out.  We have made this one of (many ) Holiday traditions to watch.  Hilarious in a very raunchy way.,1356307200,,140,4.148148148148148
2858770,5,B000R5O01I,"This movie is one of the funniest of all time, a true holiday classic.  It's John Ritter's final film, and he's amazing in every scene he's in.  It's not for everyone, truly dark and filthy, but that's what makes it so unique and flat-out hilarious.",1329782400,,249,4.511111111111111
2858771,5,B000R5O01I,"I watch Christmas movies once a year so this will be a great addition.  Let's face it, White Christmas, A Christmas Carol, Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street are outstanding in their own way but Bad Santa is outrageous.  Gotta have something off the wall to shake it up.  The Blu Ray video is great, but I don't have the equipment to do a side by side comparison with a regular DVD.  Is it the Blu Ray or my plasma big screen that makes the picture quality so good?",1312502400,,467,4.213483146067416
2858772,5,B000R5O01I,"The best Santa movie is BAD SANTA starring Billy Bob Thornton as a profane, angry, cynical, doomed alcoholic thief who finds the meaning of an authentic Christmas spirit in the unconditional love of a fat, bullied boy.  Raw and real and funny and beautiful.  The movie is a masterpiece but not for all tastes.  Three editions of the film exist including BAD(DER) SANTA.",1299801600,,369,4.825396825396825
2858783,5,B000R5O01I,Quality is great - got it quickly - and of course we already knew we loved this movie~  A winner for us!,1265932800,,104,3.727272727272727
2858784,4,B000R5O01I,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Definitely the dark side of the holidays, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing...just a Bad Santa!!!",1263168000,,137,4.708333333333333
2858785,1,B000R5O01I,"Can't play DVD in Austrlia. I bought it when I was new to Amazon and I would loose money sending it back for a refund. As the page was emailed to a Australian address, I thought I would be able to play it. I have learnd the hard way. It would be good if only 'any region' Blu Ray titles could be emailed out to those in region 2.",1261958400,,329,3.782608695652174
2858786,5,B000R5O01I,"There's more to the ""mall Santa photo"" business than meets the eye! Kudos to the writers of this film, and to Billy Bob's performance as a bitter, alcoholic, safe-cracker, playing Santa for the season for alterior motives.
I've been in the ""mall Santa photo"" business for 30 years, and the small details that the writers and director put into this movie have me rolling on the floor, everytime I watch it, which is at least 20 times every December.
The deterioration of Billy Bob's Santa outfit, from the start of the movie to the end, is a perfect analogy to our attitude about the season, and the setting for the story is right out of every nightmare that I ever had.
Probably too rauchy for a lot of people, both in language and sexual situations, but for me.....I raise my shot glass in homage to the genius that is this movie!!!",1261872000,,833,4.52317880794702
2858787,4,B000R5O01I,"Billy Bob Thornton's character is one of the most unlikeable in film history, but his brilliant acting blends perfectly with the hilarious script. Forget watching this movie in the same house as any young ones, unless their rooms are 100% soundproof. The fact that this film has no shame is what makes so many scenes laugh out loud funny. You just don't hear this kind of stuff in movies. This was also John Ritter's last role before his death and along with Slingblade (also with Billy Bob Thornton), this one shows just how talented he really was. He manages to get more than his share of uncomfortable laughs. I also have to mention the main kid's performance because he is just so darn lovable. Along with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Bad Santa is always at the top of my list to watch during the holidays. The perfect movie for any Grinch who wouldn't be upset with finding nothing but coal and liquor in their stocking.

By the way, the most complete version is Badder Santa (Unrated), not the Director's Cut.",1260748800,4,1025,4.694444444444445
2858788,5,B000R5O01I,"I saw parts of this movie on television. The parts I did see were ""hiliarously funny"". Ordered the movie to watch from beginning to end. Did enjoy it!",1259971200,,150,4.392857142857143
2858789,5,B000R5O01I,...A drunken Santa and his angry midget sidekick with a shopaholic wife pulling off Christmas time burglaries...How the f@#$ could it miss!!!  Only a serious prude would not find at least parts of this film funny.  Looks and sounds great in high definition.,1254528000,,257,4.953488372093023
2858790,5,B000R5O01I,"Not a lot to say. If you like dark, warped and twisted comedy and vulgarity, it's hard to do better than Bad(der) Santa.",1239062400,2,120,4.260869565217392
2858791,4,B000R5O01I,Bad Santa (The Unrated Version and Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] (Purchased on 12/26/2007) Great Movie. Was glad to see that the Blu version include both film cuts. I gave it 4 stars for the simple matter of grain. Grain drives me nuts. I want to see a crystal clear movie Directors. They really should give a us two versions one with grain and the other grain free.,1220227200,3,362,4.5

8198952,2,B000R5O01I,"I was looking forward to much more, based on the reviews that I read here, but I got much less than I had hoped for.  This is basically (as other reviewers have pointed out) a one-joke movie, and that one joke doesn't go very far.  But even more than that, I felt all the way through that the filmmakers really didn't know what they wanted--did they want a comedy, or did they want to explore the depths of depravity as Thornton's character searches out some sort of redemption?  Because of this ambivalence, neither aspect is very well developed.  The comedy side was pretty much all powered by vulgarity and supposedly shocking things--and was so much overdone that it was no longer funny after just a few minutes--and the drama was poorly developed and superficial--not everyone whose dad was a terrible person turns out to be a terrible person himself.  And yes, a female character who helps to ""turn him around"" seems to be necessary by Hollywood standards (they need a female lead, after all) in such a film, but it requires a huge suspension of disbelief that this woman would want to be with this man, even if he is wearing a Santa suit.  All in all, we'll be giving this one away immediately and never watching it again.  It was okay for one view, but just okay.",1450483200,2,1271,4.548245614035087
8198953,5,B000R5O01I,"Classic!! there are 4 Christmas movies i watch every year with this being one of them, Billy Bob Thornton is Great in this movie! has some great actors in it including Bernie Mac, This is not a movie to watch when the kids are up, its very vulgar and and has explicit scenes, i purchased this for around $4 on Blurry, can't beat that price for such a great movie that i watch often!

My Bluray has the Unrated and Director Cut Version, Watch the Unrated Version!!",1450051200,,463,4.32183908045977

8198956,5,B000R5O01I,Great movie with both endings. Top notch and pure hilarity. When looking for the perfect holiday movie with the prudish in-laws look no further than BAD SANTA!,1392940800,,159,4.925925925925926
