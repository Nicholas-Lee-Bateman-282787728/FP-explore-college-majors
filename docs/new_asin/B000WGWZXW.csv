8223385,5,B000WGWZXW,"This is one of the real gems in an eight DVDs Time-Life collection of classic country music performances from Grand Ole Opry. Interstingly enough, even though the title of this disc is about #1 hits, it actually includes several artists who are dimly remembered today -- including Ernest Ashworth, George Hamilton IV, Henson Cargill and Leroy Van Dyke -- as well as some real old-timers like Cowboy Copas.  The off-the-beaten-track material is quite welcome, as are big hits like Donna Fargo's ""Funny Face"" and Stonewall Jackson's ""Waterloo.""

This disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans. The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand."" The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, the way it used to be. This collection is a true gift -- highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1197244800,3,1195,5.03030303030303
