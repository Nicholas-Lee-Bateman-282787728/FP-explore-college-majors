3846967,5,B0024ML0GU,"When Columbia Pictures signed The Three Stooges to a long-term film contract starting back in 1934, little did they realize that these knuckleheads would soon go on to become one of the country's most popular and best-loved comedy teams of all time. Finally, Sony has gotten things right for a change by releasing these DVD sets containing the classic short films made by the Stooges for Columbia. Even better is the fact that the shorts are presented in high definition and in the original release order. The complete contents of the first four volumes and the first half of volume five feature every one of the films with the trio of Moe, Larry and Curly from their debut ""Woman Haters"" to their last film together, ""Half-Wits Holiday"". The second half of volume five and all of volume six features the original Stooge line-up of Moe, Larry and Shemp starting with the film short ""Fright Night"". To have this collection is a Stoogeaholic dream come true. These shorts are in the most pristine versions ever made available. Now, we can hardly wait for the remaining titles with Shemp, along with the Joe Besser shorts that end with ""Sappy Bullfighters"". The Three Stooges are an invaluable part of American popular culture; and these DVDs are proof positive why they are still so much fun to watch, even into the 21st century.",1242518400,30,1327,4.799126637554585
3846968,4,B0024ML0GU,"As one of many Stooge fans, it is great that the Three Stooges have finally been put on DVD in chronological order.  That being said, it is almost a waste to buy this set, if you have the volumes individually.  As the other reviewer said, this is not the end of the shorts.  They went on until the short ""Sappy Bullfighters"" with Joe Besser.  If you do not own any of the volumes, it is worth picking up this set.  However, if you've been purchasing the individual ones, just bypass this set and continue to buy the separate volumes.  In time, I'm confident that there will be a truly complete box set with all 190 shorts from 1934-1958.",1242432000,14,637,4.3559322033898304
3846969,5,B0024ML0GU,It's nice to see a bundle of these classic shorts.. but where are the rest?  The shorts continued until 1957 I believe with Joe Besser then Curly Joe Derita.  Even though these are the end.. for completists we need to have them!!!,1240617600,3,230,4.4523809523809526
3846970,5,B0024ML0GU,"I have heard it said that women, most anyway, don't like the Stooges . Maybe they think it really is funny , but think their husbands or boyfriends will ignore them while watching and laughing. These were done 'tongue in cheek' and weren't meant to be ""Citizen Cain"" . In today's times we need all the laughs we can get . If these DVDs (haven't arrived yet) are truly in HD as the ones I saw on Cable/Dish over the Christmas Holidays you will be amazed at the perfect, and I repeat perfect quality . They began in the 30s and they looked as if they had been made in the last few months using the very latest technology. Our TV has a feature where anything filmed, if you wish to use it during a movie, makes the picture almost pop off the screen similar to 3D. The Stooges, in all their wonder, were there as if they would step into the room at any time . I have always loved the guys , but must admit I was so surprised at how good they had been re-mastered I didn't pay as much attention to the theme of the show as usual. There is time for this later, and after all as I said before it isn't like you are trying to get so entertwined in the plot as in a ""Citizen Cain"" or some other great that is always in the top ten of all time great films. The Stooges are what they are, and were meant to be, something to allow you to laugh and forget your troubles for 15-16 minutes per episode. BUT now you will see them as not even the producers could have dreamed they would ever be seen. You will truly be amazed with the quality , especially if your TV has the capabliity to reproduce the quality which these now have with the re-mastering in HD. Thanks to all who were responsible for this and I hope this inspires all who bring out future 'old time greats' to do the same , as far as the perfect copies these have .",1265241600,,1814,4.069832402234637

3846972,5,B0024ML0GU,"This was a gift for my mother and she loved it. She saw these short films when she was young.
The quality of the picture is very good and clear and the sound is good. This kind of humor is not for everyone but if you like it this set is the best to buy. A lot of laughs for the right person.",1264464000,,291,3.634920634920635
3846973,3,B0024ML0GU,"I was about to order this set and did a little research.  If you order all six DVDs separately you save over six dollars.  What's with that?  Don't you usually get a discount if you order complete sets?

Now they offer the 1-7 set for about $30 less, what's going on with this product?",1262736000,11,285,4.222222222222222

3846976,5,B0024ML0GU,I have been a Three Stooges fan since I was a kid.  I would have paid twice as much for this collection!!  Well worth it!!!,1257033600,2,123,3.88
3846977,5,B0024ML0GU,The video quality is the best that you can get for B/W and the audio is excellent! I have gotten many before this and been disappointed. No disappointment here! If you are a stooges fan buy it now.,1255910400,7,197,4.2105263157894735

8350679,5,B0024ML0GU,"The Three Stooges.  What more can I say, porcupine.  This set made my wife a fan of the Stooges.  She is in dental school and howled at the episodes where Moe, Larry and Shemp attend dental school and then set up shop in the Old West.",1401321600,,234,4.043478260869565
8350680,5,B0024ML0GU,What's not to love?  It's the stooges after all.  Brings back good memories.  I love them.  CAUTION!!  You may laugh 'till you hurt.,1375920000,,132,4.565217391304348
8350681,5,B0024ML0GU,Awesome all the way around. Love watching all the old Three Stooges shows. A fantastic set of DVDs for an amazing price!,1324944000,,120,4.5
8350682,5,B0024ML0GU,Nothing compares to the quality of these editions and the hours of laughs they have given to me and my friends and family who have been so fortunate to have been around during my viewings of these 8 volumes.  I don't think i'll ever have anything in my dvd collection that even comes close to providing so many hours of non-stop laughs.,1289865600,,336,4.419354838709677
8350683,5,B0024ML0GU,"The quality of the transfer to DVD is extremely good.  Far better than the versions that I see on regular TV.  If you are a Three Stooges fan (or maybe just male), then these are a must own!",1281312000,,190,3.973684210526316
8350684,5,B0024ML0GU,"I purchased the entire series, and I love them all (even the Joe Besser ones, I have to admit). The cost is very reasonable considering the large number of episodes you get on each set, the quality of the movies, the exceptional sound, and the colorful, sturdy packaging. You even get two pairs of 3D glasses in collections that include 3D movies (the only drawback is that that glasses are really, REALLY small). I waited a long time to get these all on DVD; I've seen episodes I've not watched on television for over 30 years. Now I can watch them any time I want to. I ordered a couple collections from resellers through Amazon and they took up to two weeks to receive, but the shipping from Amazon was very fast - less than 5 days whenever I ordered them.",1277337600,,759,4.390070921985815
8350685,5,B0024ML0GU,"Bought these years ago on tape. DVDs have more episodes per disk, much better bargain.",1275868800,,86,4.8
8350686,5,B0024ML0GU,"For 3 Stooges fans trying to decide what to buy, this is the collection to get. Everything is here, in the release order, and in excellent prints. Very satisfying for the 3 Stooges fan.

The 3 stooges were a violent slapstick team that quickly developed a cruel but farcical comedy style based on slapping and eye-gouging that might shock a parent unused to slapstick. A lot of their themes and ideas were inventive and clever, though, so it's a little more rewarding than many old comedy films and shorts. The Stooges somehow managed to transcend their time and are still funny and worth watching, even decades after their heyday.",1270944000,,631,4.7889908256880735
8350687,5,B0024ML0GU,"Excellent picture and sound.  You can notice these WERE NOT dubbed off a vhs tape.  Very professional DVD cases.  It's has Sony's name on it, so you know its good.  Great price.",1270080000,,177,4.4375
8350688,5,B0024ML0GU,"Finally, a collection worthy for those who loved watching the Three Stooges.

I used to watch them every chance I got of the antics of these slap stick comedians; however, when they were shown by the local TV station the quality of the film had deteriorated to almost obliteration.  Faded out, streaking with light strings & bare spots from where the frames were scraped of the images.  Now with the restoration techniques available from technology of today they are back to there glorious black & white original quality.

I like the way Sony has them sequenced in their chronological order of release.  Also to note that from the first few shorts where Curly was listed last in the pictured opening of the shorts his name was spelt Curley.  Later when the short ""Disorder in the Court"" his name was spelt Curly without the ""E"".  I liked where later on Curly developed a routine to be used against Moe; it is when he does a jerky hand motion in front of Moe face and he get entranced by it, which in turn make Moe snap his neck.  Curly goes up & down, side to side or a combinations of the two.  It beats that pumping ordeal he does with Moe's arm like he's trying to pump water.

Since I had ordered volumes 1 through 6, I had to get volume 7 to make a complete set.  To say again, I always have liked and LMAO, not as much as when I was young, watching these knuckle heads.  In the future, I going to get their movies, which were a riot and full of laughs.",1269820800,,1458,4.3003663003663
