6456429,5,B00L16P29Q,"I have shown this DVD to my kindergarten class and it was given a 24 thumbs up!  It, along with our other LeapFrog DVDs are the most requested in the classroom.  I am so excited that my young students find this entertaining - and yet they are learning so much about math!  They are counting, adding, and subtracting.  Making learning fun is what the LeapFrog company does.  This is why I use and recommend their products to all my families.",1410652800,5,440,4.45
6456430,5,B00L16P29Q,Leapfrog has done it again with a hit.  Children of various ages from 2 to 8 are enthralled when the video is on.  The stories are interesting and educational.  Leapfrog sent me this video to preview through the Leapfrog Ambassador Program and my students are so thankful to them.  If you purchase this video you will not regret it.,1410220800,3,332,4.576271186440678
6456431,5,B00L16P29Q,"Counting, addition, subtraction, data collecting, and problem solving...you will find all of these kindergarten math skills wrapped into this fun and exciting LeapFrog video!

Stirring Up the Excitement in Learning!
Counting, addition, subtraction, data collecting, and problem solving...you will find all of these kindergarten math skills wrapped into this fun and exciting LeapFrog video!

I am a teacher participating in the LeapFrog Teacher Ambassador Program and I receive free LeapFrog products in connection with my participation in this program.  Therefore, I was able to preview this new video with my kindergarten students and to learn of their reactions. During the viewing of the video, my students had their eyes glued to the television and the classroom was filled with their laughter. My students quickly caught on to the learning songs sung by all the characters and were singing along to the video within just seconds! Once the video had ended, my students immediately began to share their favorite characters and parts of the movie. Throughout the remainder of the school day, my students continued to sing the adorable learning songs they learned and begged to watch it again! This video will be added to our classroom collection of LeapFrog videos and will be watched multiple times to remind my students how easy it is to learn very important kindergarten skills that will enable them to become successful learners!

This kindergarten class gives Counting on Lemonade two thumbs up! Awesome job LeapFrog and thank you for making learning so much fun!",1410220800,4,1571,5.272
6456432,5,B00L16P29Q,"I love that the friends practice many different math skills using different ways to attack the problem. They subtract using a number line, by singing (to help memorize basic facts), and by removing groups of coins to act out subtraction story problems. As a kindergarten LeapFrog teacher ambassador I was given this DVD to preview (and I can't wait to use it in my classroom).",1409184000,10,376,4.8
6456453,3,B00L16P29Q,"Not really suitable for a very young two. I would have preferred a little more emphasis on  actual counting, and a little less in the way of storyline.",1487721600,,151,4.392857142857143
6456454,5,B00L16P29Q,My 3 almost 4 year old loves the LeapFrog videos. We had been working a lot on letters and not much on math. After watching this a few times she comes to me and tells me what 2+2 is and so on. I know she doesn't quite grasp the concept completely but knowing that some basics are being learned and remembered is enough for me right now.,1483660800,2,336,4.029850746268656

6456483,5,B00L16P29Q,"We love the Leap Frog Letter Factory series.  This is my daughter's favorite one.  It is a good story, filled with fun characters and catchy songs.  They do a great job of introducing numbers 1-20 and basic math concepts in a fun way.  The show has good production values, which makes it very watchable.  Can't wait for them to come out with the next show in the series!",1444176000,,370,4.382352941176471
6456484,5,B00L16P29Q,she keeps asking to watch this one and there are definitely skills she doesn't know (yet) in this video. I feel confident she will pick them up here.,1443139200,,149,4.357142857142857

6456487,4,B00L16P29Q,"This is OK, it practices some solid math basics in a conventional way. No songs which I'm used too so again the new ones are a little disappointing. I find concepts go through better when played with catchy tunes to get a concept. It doesn't draw small kids into it anymore because of lack of music but great for kindergarten and pre k any younger isn't the best way to learn the concept.",1440460800,3,388,4.328767123287672
6456488,5,B00L16P29Q,Bought this for my son as an alternative to his usual characters that he watches from tv & he actually liked it! A lot of numbers and counting. We both were happy with this.,1438473600,,173,4.117647058823529
6456489,4,B00L16P29Q,Math moon is better for numbers and skip counting. Math circus is better for adding and subtracting. BUT the kids love this and watch it repeatedly. Good songs higher level thinking and better than TV shows.,1437955200,,207,4.777777777777778
6456490,5,B00L16P29Q,I love this one!  I own most of the Leap Frog DVD's - it's just so annoying to have to return them to the library.  This is a bit more advanced - they need to have a handle on numbers from 1 to 10.  I recommend doing Math Adventures to the Moon and Numbers Ahoy first.  These DVD's are my 3-year-old's preferred viewing choices.,1433721600,,328,4.078125
6456491,5,B00L16P29Q,"This is my daughter's favorite LeapFrog movie. The songs are annoying but extremely educational so how can we really complain? Both my kids (3.5 and 2) watch the LeapFrog movies like they are in a transe but they will then sing the songs for days afterwards. They just started watching these a few months and I can really tell a difference in how much they know and understand numbers. My son counts all the time, much more than my daughter did at his age. They watch them 3-4 times a week.",1431734400,,490,4.395604395604396

6456495,4,B00L16P29Q,"I bought this after I purchased the 2 other videos about the alphabet.  It is good,  but my 3 and 4 year old have little interest in watching it again.",1430352000,,151,4.0

6456497,5,B00L16P29Q,"My class really enjoys this movie, and it covers areas of Common Core Math.  It is far better than the outdated Leapfrog Circus Math DVD.",1427587200,,137,4.48

6456499,5,B00L16P29Q,My Kindergarten class absolutely LOVES this DVD. They ask to watch it every time I give them the choice. It teaches addition and subtraction in a way that small children can relate and think is fun.,1426118400,,198,4.527777777777778

6456501,5,B00L16P29Q,"We bought this from Toys R Us on a road trip because I couldn't listen to our other DVDs any longer :-).

Pros
- I really like this product. It is well designed.
- The 1 year old loved this. She is so engaged any time it is on. The 2 year old likes it as well.
- The way it teaches counting seems to work for my kids.
- The songs are really cool and the animation is Disney quality.
- I like the entrepreneurial aspect of the lemonade stand.
- This DVD is worth $10 or $15. I think I paid around $12 for it in Toys R Us but I don't remember.

Cons
- None at  all",1424649600,,562,3.6666666666666665
6456502,5,B00L16P29Q,"As usual, Leapfrog came out with another great educational DVD.  This time the CGI quality is up-to-date (it's about time - took them long enough).  My 2 years old loves it, and hope there will be more coming out soon.  By the way, I just hope they'll update all the old DVDs to today's CGI quality.",1422748800,,299,4.303571428571429

6456515,5,B00L16P29Q,Best Letter Factory movie thus far. My 2 year old daughter watched this movie over & over again because she loved it. After a week she learned to count from 0-13. We were in the grocery store and out of the blue she counted to 13! I was stunned! The movie teaches kids to count to 20. And teaches addition and subtraction.,1419811200,,322,4.209677419354839

I actually purchase these, none have been free to me (so many reviews now are done by people who get the item for free, not me!)  The songs are catchy, the concepts are clear, my kids really learn from these (more fun than workbooks or flashcards with mom).  I will keep buying these, make more on reading especially please!",1416355200,3,464,4.554216867469879
