8444812,3,B004WB18RC,Really just basic information.  Not what I was expecting.  No information regarding how to read the display or what you see on the display might mean.,1364169600,8,150,4.730769230769231
8444813,2,B004WB18RC,I guess I should blame myself for this but.... This video was a waste of money. All it really does is read you the owners manual. Not at all what I expected. I actually thought it was more of lessons in how it works and how to really use it. It's more of a video that just shows you what the buttons do. SO... I would not purchase this video if I were you. I would simply read the manual. It's much better than this...,1329436800,8,418,3.929411764705882
