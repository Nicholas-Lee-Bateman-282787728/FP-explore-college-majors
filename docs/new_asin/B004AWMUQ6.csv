4312360,4,B004AWMUQ6,"Kim Possible is an average teenage girl...Excellent student, head cheerleader, community volunteer, superhero.  Superhero???  Yes, she is. Kim Possible is a globetrotting hero saving lives, communities and small cute animals.  With her trusted sidekick Ron Stoppable and his pet naked mole rat, Rufus, much adventure and wackyness ensues.  While Kim excels at just about everything, Ron is more of a slacker in his studies, and a klutz during missions.  His klutziness is also a wildcard factor in those same missions, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering.  And Rufus, the naked mole rat is probably smarter than both of them combined.  They deal with world-conquering villains like Dr. Drakken, his sidekick SheGo, Dr. DeMento and others during their missions while dealing the with personal archnemesis in high school, Bonnie Rockwaller and Mr. Barkin. The stories are solid and rarely cross into slapstick that makes me cringe. If the series has any real flaw, it's that seasons 3 & 4 were never released onto dvd and apparently never will be as far as I can tell.  Otherwise, Kim Possible is likely one of the best animated series around and I can testify with experience that finding a well-written female lead character in any type of fiction is exteremely difficult.  Also there were two Kim Possible movies - ""A Stitch In Time"" and ""So The Drama"", both of which were well-done and revealed much personal development with the main characters later in the series.",1345680000,2,1471,5.121338912133891
4312361,5,B004AWMUQ6,"Kim Possible is just about the best role model a ""tween"" girl could have.  Sure she's got a bit of a headstart since her Mom's a Brain Surgeon, and her Dad's a Rocket Scientist, but what counts is how she uses what they gave her!  Never hesitating to help whenever and wherever she can, Kim is the embodyment of self-confidence.

Except at School.  As all-too many kids know, School is a ""holding cell"" where you are confined with stupid and ignorant people who think they are superior to you just because they are older; and then there are the other Students!

Anyway the charm of this show is how she ""deals"" with it all.  Some techniques are transferrable to the ""real world"" and some less so, but what counts most is her attitude to it all.

This was reflected in the Write-In campaign that got the show a 4th season, after Disney had cancelled.  Now we just need them to release Seasons 3 & 4.

Any Day now, Guys!",1327104000,29,918,4.384615384615385
4312362,5,B004AWMUQ6,"Finally out!

4312381,5,B004AWMUQ6,"One of the better Disney cartoons for older 'kids'.  The characters are often well developed, and stories are good.  The rat character was a big mistake though.  If you can get past that, okay.  Like typical Disney, the villains are well done.",1359849600,,243,4.714285714285714

8421039,4,B004AWMUQ6,"If you're here in 2018 or later, you've probably seen the show and know how fun it is for all ages. If you haven't, try The Secret Files before committing to a full season.

First thing to mention is, DON'T BUY ""A SITCH IN TIME."" This season includes it as a 3-part episode. Not sure
Second is, Amazon is not the place to buy it. It's a Disney Movie Club exclusive, where it's about $15-20, and is only sold on Amazon through middlemen. The Disney Movie Club has catches of its own, but for just a little more than these two seasons on Amazon, you could get 8 or 9 there (4 being free).

About the DVDs, the three discs come individually packed in slim DVD cases with a cardboard jacket. They could've easily fit in a multi-disc case, but oh well. The transfers are much higher quality than the ""Secret Files"" DVD.

Episodes include:
Naked Genius
Grudge Match
Two to Tutor
The Ron Factor
Car Trouble
Rufus in Show/Adventures in Rufus-Sitting
Job Unfair
The Golden Years
