i have always loved gian maria volonte, older here but still handsome and commanding...funes and the prostitutes are varied and individual...the young nephew whom funes loves is also perfectly cast...if you don't know the tango you will  after you see this film and the lyrics are deeply moving and poetic and significant....don't know if the actress playing funes is actually playing...i bought a cd by the great gardel after seeing this...i always share this with friends and they all are startled by it.",1461024000,,648,5.0
8338903,5,B001RUAL9C,"I was shown this film by a friend who had seen it some years before. I was absolutely enthralled by it. Not only is the story and acting great, but the music is also beyond compare. I don't know why it isn't more well-known than it is. I enjoyed every minute of it.",1354406400,2,265,4.018867924528302
