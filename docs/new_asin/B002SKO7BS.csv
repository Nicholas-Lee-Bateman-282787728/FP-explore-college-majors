3981704,3,B002SKO7BS,"i also have HD moods Aquarium and Fire: both of those blu-rays have fixed-camera postions, with ""live"" content on them. meaning that the fireplace looks like a real fireplace, and the aquarium looks like a real fish tank.

this particular HD moods blu ray has a moving camera, so while the picture is stunning and its fun to look at, it ends up feeling like a boring documentary with no comentary.",1351468800,2,397,4.591549295774648
3981705,2,B002SKO7BS,"The visuals were pretty good, a ""B"", as not all were crisp, and the editing was done, I think, by cutting amongst scenes taken in various contexts, some of which were large public aquariums, I am pretty sure. Kudos to the surf and sunlight shots, they almost stole the show.

But that soundtrack. It was awful. It is not jazz. It is porno music. It is production house looping synth-sequencer-generated background tracks layered on top with technically-OK but artistically vapid alto sax and flute leads. It completely distracts from the mood, which should be serene and powerful. I desperately want to remix different sound to this. For the above-water scenes, I'd use the actual audio from the shoot - the booming, sizzling sound of the surf, beach wildlife, etc. The underwater scenes would have a serene track, overlaid with water sounds.

Try this: play it muted, and put on your favorite synth artist. Anyone - Vanglis, Jarre, whatever you like. It will work better than the actual track.",1299369600,2,994,4.910714285714286
3981706,2,B002SKO7BS,"Picture quality -- Most of the scenes were in stunning HD, but not all it looked like. Some were oddly blurry.  I understand that they were underwater, but still...

Content -- There was a nice variety of images -- fish and dolphins and coral and landscapes, but each scene only lasted a few seconds before switching to the next one.  So you might watch an eel for 3-4 seconds, then watch a pod of dolphins for a few seconds, then coral for a few seconds, and so on.  It was oddly disconcerting and more boring than restful, like watching someone flip through their vacation photos with no explanation at all.  I never really got into it at all.

Sound -- Quality was ok.  Soundtrack was incredibly grating.  Full disclosure here -- I'm not a huge fan of jazz, and the soundtrack was ""cool jazz.""  I wanted to keep an open mind, but I ended up turing the volume waaay down because it was SO IRRITATING and not restful at all. Some nice light classical music would have been so much nicer.

Conclusion -- give this one a pass.",1296432000,11,1025,4.404255319148936
3981707,3,B002SKO7BS,"Unlike my other two ""HDMoods"" blu-rays (Aquarium and Fire), this one does not offer various options for the soundtrack.  You are stuck with the annoying jazz music or just hitting the mute button.  It would have been much better (and more relaxing) if you could choose a ""natural"" soundtrack, like soothing surf sounds.  With the Aquarium and Fire blu-rays, you can choose just bubble sounds or crackling fire sounds, or you can choose ""spa-like"" music, or you can choose a blend of both!  I was disappointed that Blu Ocean doesn't provide several options. Let's face it, jazz is not for everyone.  That being said, the visuals are still stunning.",1278892800,13,647,4.89908256880734
3981708,5,B002SKO7BS,"This title is what it is meant to be, High Defention Ocean views with a Cool Jazz soundtrack. No plot and no dialogue throughout the video turns your Hight Definiton TV into a picture window that faces various ocean scenes while a quiet musical track plays in the background. The scenes are more than just static video. There is plenty of movement and scene changes that make ""BLU OCEAN"" watchable. This is definitely a special intrest item since it is not the usual video/movie fare. For someone that likes the concept of the HDMoods series of videos that are available, ""BLU OCEAN"" is definitely worth checking out. For a nice background or something to use for relaxation this definitely fits those catagories.",1264032000,3,713,4.852459016393443
