8463813,4,B005B0QYTA,This will work quite well in my various aged classrooms. I enjoy having the books on a DVD to review as well.  Thank you.,1403395200,,121,4.041666666666667
8463814,5,B005B0QYTA,"My children and I learned of this book through the scholastic dvd collection. The book was animated but the best was hearing Chief Jake Swamp read the story in English and in his native Mohawk.  I can't tell you what mesmerized the children more - the beautiful paintings, the message or the music we were hearing along with the words.  My sons asked for the book after watching it over and over.  It is not just for Thanksgiving, but as Chief Jake Swamp says, it is how his people are taught to greet the day.  What a great way to begin teaching children to be grateful for what we have from the earth.",1339632000,3,603,4.3097345132743365
