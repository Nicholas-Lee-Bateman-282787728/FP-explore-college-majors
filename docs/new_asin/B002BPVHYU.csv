3895216,3,B002BPVHYU,"This is a nice DVD, however, if you live in Florida or California or any other beach residency, save your money.

First, there is no DVD menu, so if you decide you want to see a particular scene, you will be forwarding through the entire DVD to find it. You will also not be able to ""loop"" or play over and over the same scene if you want. The DVD is divided into the different islands of Hawaii (Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, etc) then you will see and hear different beach scenes (each lasting about 2-3 minutes) and goes through the entire day into sunset.

I guess if you are a BIG fan of Hawaii, you might like this, other than that, I didn't find anything exciting or relaxing about it.  I have seen other beach relaxation DVD's that focus on one beach scene and have more pristine beaches (Living Art-Endless Beach) and paid $10 rather than $25. However, I have not been able to find one in an widescreen HD or Blu-Ray mode.",1266624000,5,921,4.312138728323699

3895222,5,B002BPVHYU,"This DVD is beautiful. It is filmed in HD and widescreen. The widescreen feature is important if you have a newer flat panel television. The quality of this DVD is excellent. No human voice narration. Just relaxing sounds of the waves rolling on several different Hawaii beaches. The DVD arrived promptly after my order was placed. I highly recommend this DVD! I am hoping the people who make this DVD can format the same beaches video for iPod. They have samples at iTunes, but they have to be converted to iPod format which takes a long time for the 2 minute clips. I am waiting for hour long beach videos already formatted for syncing with my iPod. Nice job on the DVD! If you purchase this DVD you will happy.",1256688000,51,713,4.492307692307692

There is a pay channel specifically for babies that runs for free now and then on satellite, and it had a scene with waves crashing against rocks that seemed to help. This seems much more detailed and colorful and I'm sure it will be effective, if nothing else it will certainly help ME relax!",1249430400,6,444,4.426829268292683

Well this DVD is for you.
Seriously Meditation may not work, for many reasons, but pop this DVD in and turn off the phone and turn up the sound and just let the sounds of the waves wash over you. If you make it all the way through the DVD you will have experienced peace and calm like as if you were on the beach yourself.

3895257,4,B002BPVHYU,"A lot of waves, for sure! The scenes change often enough to keep it interesting from beach to beach and includes different islands; and the wave action is relaxing.

3895265,1,B002BPVHYU,"I am extremely disappointed.  I had bought this blu-ray disk a couple years ago.  Like everyone else, I considered it to be flat out WONDERFUL!  [ I have tried doing what this guy has done and it is EXTREMELY difficult'] With a couple of brief exceptions, BEAUTIFUL to see and  GREAT to hear.  But I put it away for perhaps a year and just took it out again in early Dec. '14.  Well, now-- to my great disappointment--  the sound has become TERRIBLE!! ie UNLISTENABLE.  Every few seconds there is a horrible dropout--no sound --then a few seconds  of sound, then silence, then sound.  GRRRHRR!!! [, And strangely there ARE a couple sections that remain ok.] I had been extremely careful in storing  and handling the disk; it always went  right back into its  plastic holder/thingy. only handled  by the edges  And no, my system has no problem with any other disk in my collection....So I grimace  and order a second one from Amazon a week ago.  It arrives and I --  in VERY excited anticipation--[ok, so I live in the slow lane]--eagerly  play it --and--I suppose you know by now--The sound is at least as HORRIBLE!!  as the one I was replacing.  Yes , I  tried replacing my HDMI  cable [actually, I used TWO different replacement cables; also I tried another input on my receiver-- always with the same result .  Everything plays nice except this disk.  Don't get burned like me.  If they make this right somehow I will let everyone know...Ps  I am feeling REALLY  grumpy right now because in addition to this unusable Hawaii Blu-ray from 3 days ago,  just this morning I have received ANOTHER rip off .  It's from ""My Moovies"" [that's right; 2 ""o""s'] -- out of Lexington, Ky.-- via Amazon.

3895278,5,B002BPVHYU,"Great disc, and exactly what I was hoping for!

Wife and I just got back from a 2-week stay on Maui.  As this was our second trip to Hawaii, we had a pretty clear idea of what we wanted to do; some new-found things, some trips missed from the first time out, and a few rehashes of side trips that we loved from the first trip out.  As the trip wound down and unpleasant words like ""packing"" and ""leaving"" came up, I decided to grab this off of Amazon and order it while I was still away.  When our 14 hours of return plane trips (ugh!) finally ended, we got home to a lovely little package waiting at our doorstep: Hawaii's beaches had come home with us!
This Blu-ray is really fantastic.  Color reproduction is just about perfect on all the daylight scenes.  This is best viewed on a HD screen...the bigger, the better.  If you have a 42"" TV or bigger you're really going to feel like it's a window.  I will be honest, there are a couple sunset scenes that are a little TOO perfect...it's clear they were shot on a zoom lens with a filter to keep the water ""blue"" during the scene.  No worries there...a little fantasy never hurt a soul.  Most of the sunset scenes are completely fine, in fact....it's just one or two that appear doctored a little.
Sound reproduction is phenomenal.  It's very hard to get a good audio of the waves while keeping the wind noise down (trust me on this, I have 20 minutes of HD home footage that is all wind hiss. Sigh.) but they managed to keep just the right amount of wind in without sacrificing the sound of the surf.  If you have even a low-budget sound bar with a subwoofer, you are really going to enjoy the deep rumble as the waves curl in and crash on the sand.
There are a couple minor nitpicks.  Each beach scene is a 5 minute minimum (which is GREAT!) but I do wish they offered an option where the name of the beach was flashed on the screen for a couple seconds on each scene change.  You're going to discover a lot of places you'll feel like you need to explore yourself when you watch this, so a geotag or two wouldn't have hurt.  Seems like that could have been a painless option to include on the menu.....which brings me to my second nitpick.  The menu is hard to find (or at least it was on my LG player).  For those with similar players or problems, don't try to hit Disc Menu or Info/Menu.  Use Title/Pup-Up.  You'll get it that way.  The menu is very simple, but it doesn't need to be crazy.

Simply put, I love this disc and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who needs to soak up a little of Hawaii's wonderful spirit.  I hope you enjoy it, and I hope to see you sunning yourself outside Kaanapali beach one day!  Come and say Aloha; I'll buy you a drink from KBH.",1406073600,4,2724,4.226305609284332

I would rather have it be just one relaxing beach but it does change pictures to 3 or 4 different beach scenes.  It also shows sunsets which is nice.,1391904000,4,450,4.270588235294118

The waves you could see at a lake, and sounded like it too. It did not seem like a nature photographer had anything to do with this.",1360108800,6,542,4.587628865979381

Glowing five star reviews, as well as an endorsement claiming a soothing and calmingly pleasant video experience was to be had, all served to market this purchase for me as a positive experience.... First, the video was all that was claimed, albeit a bit one dimensional.

While the beaches and sunsets were in fact, captured in all of nature's glorious colors, there was a glaring absence of people and a scant presence of wildlife? Small potatoes in my opinion! However, their presence would have added an element that was missing, something ""Interesting"" to watch!

The thing that ruined this entire experience was the ""God Awful!"" horribly intermittent-audio track, which served to make this video a ""Punishing!"" headache inducing experience...

I optimistically persisted through the entire video expecting that someone ""anyone"" would have addressed this glaringly obvious problem at some point, or
perhaps even dubbed over this audio catastrophe!
Before marketing!

But alas! It was not to be!
The only solution available therefore to the gullible purchaser, is to mute the volume, and enjoy only the wonderful video work or to dub in your own audio.

************************************************

I owe Greg Voevodsky an apology for my negative evaluation of his offering
""Hawaii Beaches 1 Waves"". Mr. Voevodsky bent over backwards to compensate me
for the poor performing Blu-ray video, after a lengthy explanation regarding the ever changing Blu-ray industry standards. I was at first ""skeptical!""

I had purchased a new Toshiba (Model: BDK21KU) Blu-ray player early in 2012 from Costco. It's purpose was to allow me to gain internet access to streaming videos from Netflix.

The software version was Version 1.7 BDX2150  and
it's software was dated ""January 12, 2012"" thus appearing to be
as current driver as could be found for this player...
My confidence was further bolstered by the fact that it's
manufacturer ""Toshiba"" was in fact the manufacturer, who's
products many corporations chose to place their brand names on...

However, just as Greg Voevodsky had said... playing the exact same
Blu-ray disk that was the cause for my poor evaluation on my older
Blu-ray player (which I had given away) did in fact play without a glitch
from beginning to end, over this past New Years Holiday.

Mr. Voevodsky was generous to a fault, in his effort to compensate me
for my inconvenience. Providing me with a DVD version  of
""Hawaii Beaches 1 Waves"" and two additional disks of their most recently
released ""Florida Beaches 2"" on both Blu-ray and DVD disks. All at no
cost to me!

It is most unfortunate that the march of progress does not include
some ""backwards"" compatibility to avoid problem like this.
And more so yet, for those producers like Mr. Voevodsky, who was forced
to try and explain ""why"" his production was failing to run as promised.
Because of a change in the industry's Blu-ray audio standards.",1338249600,5,3014,5.126530612244898

 I would like to have seen a bit more life in the scenery. I liked the turtle, but, sailboats and maybe a few surfers would have been fun. It would give a bit more life to the horizon. I am glad there is no music or talking.

3895336,5,B002BPVHYU,"This Blu-ray 1080P version of Hawaii Beaches is unbelievably beautiful, it's as if you are looking out a window in Hawaii.  My favorite part is the lack of the cheezy new-age music many of these relaxation videos force you to listen to - it's nothing but the sounds of the ocean .... it's very nice simply having this on while at home or in your home office.",1311984000,16,358,4.343283582089552
3895337,3,B002BPVHYU,"I guess I expected more from a Beaches video.  This one seems to have several fixed shots of the same beaches from different angles. It's not quite like the Real Thing, because you don't get the Panoramic effect like you might expect. Instead, it's more like looking (from several steps back) out a large picture window. You don't feel the expansiveness of being at the Beach, so it gets somewhat claustrophobic after awhile. Had they used Panavision, or some Panoramic lense to film this, the realism would have been many times more effective.  I have watched this several times now on my 92 inch 1080p projection TV, and am tired of it already. Even guests tire of it in a short time.  Somewhat of a novelty to distract guests from the background, but not something you would sit down and watch for any length of time.",1310083200,4,820,4.602739726027397

This is one of the simplest and most affordable ways to let your stress melt away!  This DVD shows beautiful Hawaiian beach scenes (a few minutes on each scene, with gradual progression so that the next scene is another (more distant or close up or another angle) of the same area.  It is divided in sections, with scenes from different Hawaiian islands.  Some are sunrise, some are sunset, some even show action scenes with a playful beached seal or a turtle.  While you are watching these scenes, the background sound is only the natural sound occurring in the scene (ocean waves with a few other sounds such as a seagull)--no cheesy new age music.  Sometimes I leave this DVD playing while I do chores in the house, and it just leaves me feeling calm and peaceful.  If I sit on the couch while it is playing, it lulls me to sleep--I've not used it to help me sleep at night, but it sure would work for that.  I may be landlocked and hours and hours from the ocean, but when this is playing in my house, I feel like the ocean is right outside my window.",1307145600,4,1177,4.3090909090909095

3895342,2,B002BPVHYU,"The blu-ray audio modes are nice, but video quality is ok; just don't compare it with BBC nature series. Beach footages pretty much were all shot from ""fixed"" spot and camera angle (i.e. 0 movement, not even a zoom in or out). It is kind of boring to watch rotation of repeated few fixed scenes, which make of the whole blu-ray. The product advertised 110 minutes play time, but it is only about 21 minutes before it starts repeating. In my opinion, this disc falls short of delivering.

Don't get me wrong, this looks as good as a DVD is going to get, but it would be absolutely stunning on blu-ray.  The main audio track has the nature sounds only, but there are several other tracks with music if you are into that.  I think this concept of recording video of waves may be the best use of my Home Theater I've found so far.  By the way, I have an outstanding audio system and I'm happy with the sound quality of their recording which is saying a lot because I'm am very picky.

3895348,5,B002BPVHYU,"this is definitely what I was looking for. I wanted to give my wife something better than our home videos of Waikiki - at least until I can take her back there again. This DVD delivered in buckets.

The beaches are just fantastic. The soundtrack is even better - because it is real. Yes, I got the real sound of the surf, a few birds chirping in the distance. No stupid music or commercials or people. Speaking of which, there's hardly any people in these shots. All of this might be enough to turn some of you away, but for me that was exactly what I wanted.

The CD says HD on the cover, which made me wonder if I was going to get cheesy grain on my BlueRay player. Actually, it turned out nicely. I can't swear that it comes out as good as if I play a BlueRay disc, but dang it sure looks like high-def to my old eyes.

Only 1 minus I can see. The colors are a bit saturated. No, I ain't no PrePress professinal, but I understand the fundamentals. So I ended up taking the contrast down on my tv to accomodate. Whattayaknow, my wife likes it better with the slightly-saturated colors! You can see it in the blue of the water and the red of the skies; sometimes. But if you're getting it for someone who *likes* it that way, then what's there to complain about, eh?

3895352,5,B002BPVHYU,"I love to pop this blu-ray disk into my Panasonic BR player (with Samsung 46 LCD TV) and watch for 15 - 30 minutes.  Just long enough to 'deeply imagine myself there'.  I've been to Hawaii 3 times now so I think that helps: I can mix my real-life memories with the scenes on the disk.  I personally enjoy how these ""Waves"" series DVDs are produced: ~3 minutes per scene with nothing much to distract other than waves moving, fluffy clouds along the horizon, and an occasional kite or sailboat off in the distance.  Pretty funny when you think about it, just set up a really nice HD camera with a solid tripod, shoot a 'scene' several times in one day (I assume) and choose the best 3-minute-ish combination of light, sky/clouds, and sounds.

With this blu-ray format, the sand, water, clouds and sky really do pop off the screen.  It really is virtually like looking through a clean window outside to a real beach.  I don't so much enjoy this disc for the 'relaxing' aspects, but rather the warmth and bright tropical light that it exudes if you will.

If you have the patience and imagination to really let yourself get immersed in the scenes, it can really give you a boost on a cloudy winter day.",1272326400,4,1199,4.467889908256881

8361833,5,B002BPVHYU,"This DVD is just what I was looking for - beautiful ocean waves on my TV.  I don't have a 4K TV, but this DVD makes it look almost 4K: it's beautiful scenery with great sounds of the ocean that are real-time (not like other DVD's I've tried that sound like prerecorded tracks that don't match up to the pictures).  Lots of different scenes, all relaxing, all gorgeous.  If you're looking for Ocean waves, buy this DVD, you won't be sorry!",1499212800,3,438,4.382716049382716
