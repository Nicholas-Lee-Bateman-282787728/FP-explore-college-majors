8320854,3,B001MBTRK0,"Cheryll Gillespie, a milf with an annoying voice, is a tour guide like Rick Steves and Samantha Brown. She also offers shopping tips. In this episode, she heads to Singapore, which has a nice skyline. I rented this on YouTube, but I won't buy the DVD.

While Singapore is mostly Chinese, it also has a significant Indian and Malaysian population. This episode starts off boring. She spent too much time shopping and not enough time exploring the city. Ten minutes into the episode, she heads to the Singapore Zoo, which is quite impressive. She later visited a fortune teller in Little India as well as a traditional Chinese doctor.

She later stopped by a Muslim neighborhood before heading to a spa. She went to the Mustafa shopping center, which is open 24 hours. After a brief visit to Chinatown, she concluded her trip at the Nature Orchid Garden.

I didn't feel this episode because she did too much shopping and Singapore isn't one of my favorite cities.",1399852800,,961,4.74251497005988
