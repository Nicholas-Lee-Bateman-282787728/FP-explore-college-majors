8414512,5,B00439ST3Y,"Originally carried by the BBC in the 1980s, Robin of Sherwood was one of the best series of its era. After three decades, its influence on how Robin Hood is portrayed can still be seen, from its over the top take on the Sheriff of Nottingham to including a Saracen as one of the merry men.
Richard Carpenter led the efforts on this show, offering a lush if somewhat grim look at the Robin Hood mythology. The scenery is remarkable and adds to the show. So does, strangely enough, the haunting and memorable soundtrack by Irish New Age band Clannad. There are some interesting threads here as Saxons battle Normans, pagans try to keep their legacy alive, distant wars and local tyranny all come together to present a fascinating tapestry.

The show lasted three seasons and there are two lead actors playing very different Robin Hoods (the plural is intentional there). Michael Praed offers a strong and fascinating take as Robin of Loxley in the first two seasons. He is helped by a great cast including Judi Trott as a strong and feisty Maid Marion, Nickolas Grace as the Sheriff and the late Robert Addie as the sneering Guy of Gisburne. Much of the story is turned upside down with Richard the Lionheart--played by the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies in a memorable guest appearance--shown in a far less heroic light that he usually is in the Robin Hood stories.

The first two seasons are excellent and moving with Praed in the lead role. But the third season, far longer than the first two, loses momentum, especially as Jason Connery (Seans son) takes over in the lead role. He simply is not as strong a lead as Praed was and the series limped to a conclusion at the end of the third season.

There is much to ponder here and the action scenes guide the show along. So do the strong cast, wonderful music and lovely settings. This show is certainly flawed as the actors sometimes ham it up, some strange mystical asides, major plot holes and plenty of unresolved threads. But it also provides moving moments (especially the end of the second season) and exciting stories. Fantasy and medieval genre fans should enjoy this show even if the third season drags as the show came in for a landing. Highly recommended.",1497052800,,2220,4.672634271099744

The attention to detail, like true period costume and living conditions for the poor make this a level above a lot of stuff produced about this time of our history. Plus the addition of Pagan themes is great!",1467590400,2,287,4.433962264150943
