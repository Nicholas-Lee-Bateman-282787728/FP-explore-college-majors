Trivia: Idle wasn't initially going to play Dirk, but shortly before filming began, he had an appendectomy and was in the hospital for ten days. By the time he got out, he had lost so much weight that he could play the part.

Technically, though, this disc is a mess. The video looks about like you would expect a thirty-five-year-old documentary shot for television to look. Colors are obviously restored; there's a lack of depth across the spectrum that makes some exterior scenes look almost colorized. Under the circumstances, though it works (documentary, archival footage, all that), and the images are never overly soft. The DTS-HD surround audio is clear enough to fully appreciate how carefully Innes managed to replicate the Beatles' soundthough there's precious little ""surround"" involved.

That's not the problem, though.

The documentary is presented in 1.78:1/1080p high-definition widescreen. Pop quiz: How many made-for-TV documentaries were shot in a widescreen format? Answer: Not this one. Yes, the film has been cropped from the native 1.33:1 full frame, and it's obvious.

Extras arewell, odd. You get the original SNL bit from 1977, and a commentary track, which isn't really a commentary track, but an interview with Idle. It gives a lot of fun stuff about The Rutles and the filming of everything, but it's not really a commentary, as it covers both documentaries. Think of it more as an audio-only interview that just happens to be playing instead of the primary audio track. Also, it's about 15 minutes shorter than the feature.

The package comes with a DVD that contains All You Need is Cash (with the same interview/commentary track) and the inferior follow-up, Can't Buy Me Lunch. The 2002 documentary has some wonderful bits with Tom Hanks, David Bowie, Bonnie Raitt, Salman Rushdie (that's right, Salman Rushdie), and a host of others. What it doesn't have is any new footage or songs from The Rutles themselves, making it more of an editing exercise than anything else. Adding insult to injury, the follow-up is also cropped to a widescreen format.

Two things would make the package more appealing, even if it warranted a higher price tag. First, presenting everything in its original aspect ratio. Second, how about a CD of The Rutles' greatest hits?

Trivia: George Harrison let Idle and Innes bounce ideas off of him.

The Rutles themselves, as well as All You Need is Cash, are masterpieces of parody, paving the way for This Is Spinal Tap. The Rutles Anthology (Blu-ray) was an opportunity to pay tribute to the band and the mockumentaries it inspired, but the package kinda blows.

5934056,5,B00EQ2KU9Y,"The Rutles changed so much about our lives in the 60s, it's almost hard to imagine what it would have been like without them.  This documentary covers an important piece of history, openly and candidly, and even adds some little-known facts to the body of Rutle knowledge. A Must See.",1387497600,2,284,4.68

8608381,5,B00EQ2KU9Y,Beyond great- watched it two days in a row -after seening it several times before- and am still picking out fast lines I had never heard before. The indian guy as george is beyond classic!,1479513600,,188,4.4
8608382,1,B00EQ2KU9Y,I didn't look close enough and I thought it wad the actual Beatles Anthology. I was very angry and disappointed that I couldn't get a refund.,1468886400,,141,4.461538461538462
8608383,5,B00EQ2KU9Y,A must to add to any Beatles fans collection.  Love the Rutles <3,1455062400,,65,4.0
8608384,2,B00EQ2KU9Y,The bonus disc was the same as the movie. It should have had live performances of the soundtrack music.,1442620800,,103,4.473684210526316
8608385,5,B00EQ2KU9Y,"A very well done spoof of the Beatles. You will love it if you know the Beatles music and history. They really put thought and effort into this, imitating the style of the Fab Four's music and films and assembled an all-star cast including interviews with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon. It was made before John's murder so it doesn't have to decide how to deal with that. Just light hearted satire.",1416700800,2,395,4.5
8608386,2,B00EQ2KU9Y,"This is just the Rutles again.  I stupidly thought it was a Part II - a recap of a recap or something.  The humor has not aged super well either, me thinks.",1406073600,,156,3.84375
8608387,3,B00EQ2KU9Y,"The obvious advantage here is getting both Rutles films. However, this is a very strange release. There is a DVD disc and a Blu-ray disc. On the DVD disc, you have both films. On the Blu-ray, you have the first film again ! Also, the cover states the original 1978 documentary has been remastered and upscaled to HQ, but the quality is more or less the same compared to my 2001 DVD version of it. And then there's the strange chopping of the image here and there to fit the widescreen format, which is very odd. The things I miss the most, however, are the bonus. Even possessing this now, I won't get rid of my old DVD version because of the extra interviews (Jagger and Simon) and the commentary by Eric Idle. All in all, this release is OK. If you have the old DVD versions of the films, stick with them. If you don't, then you might consider buying this.",1403913600,6,858,4.302469135802469
