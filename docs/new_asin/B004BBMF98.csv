4315108,3,B004BBMF98,"The dance was great, but I couldn't understand why the camera moved to show the audience so frequently.  Yes we got it, it was recorded in Beijing; however, there was no need to remind DVD viewers so many times.",1319673600,12,211,4.410256410256411

4315110,5,B004BBMF98,"This video was even more than I'd hoped for, the Beijing location and auditorium is incredibly luxurious and somewhere I'll never get to visit, but feel like I've been able to experience this concert as if I was there. I've always wanted to see Riverdance and thought this might be a way to see it, and I couldn't have been more correct. The concert has been captured perfectly, from the angelic vocal performances, the multi-national stringed instruments, the exhilirating orchestra, to the wide variety of style in dance presented. I will watch and enjoy this video experience time and time again. Some of the best money I've spent.",1316217600,14,634,4.87962962962963
4315111,5,B004BBMF98,"Expert evaluations of Amazon media are usually available for my perusal, but there are none yet for Riverdance: Live from Beijing.  So I will make my small contribution, hoping readers will consider buying the DVD.  This was a superb and thrilling performance!  The only improvement possible would have been for us to be sitting in the audience.  The principal dancers, especially Padraic Moyles, are at the top of their game.  Though flamenco is not my favorite form of dance, Sobrado's precision and artistry on this latest DVD made me reconsider.  The audience's enthusiasm was captured so well and I could imagine being there.  Cameras caught subtle glances between dancers, interaction among players in the dramas, and even a future Riverdancer in the audience.  A musical conversation between the visiting performers and musicians from the Beijing school of music sent my heart soaring.  If world peace is possible, I think it will begin with the artists (and scientists).  This 15th anniversary of the Riverdance phenomenon showcases the troupe at the pinnacle of their art form.  I recommend it without reservation.",1313452800,31,1123,5.217877094972067
4315112,5,B004BBMF98,"Riverdance Live in Beijing is a superb experience for lovers for Irish dance. Especially fine is the filming, which gives frequent close ups of the footwork. The dancing is full of energy, particularly that of the male dancers with their spectacular leaps. Hugely imaginative and pleasurable was the ""competition"" between the Irish and traditional Black tap dancers. Also excellent are the orchestral numbers. I am not a fan of the singing, which I find mostly spiritless and sentimental -- but that is easy to fast forward through. All in all this is a fabulous DVD. I also enjoyed seeing how engrossed was the audience.",1295222400,2,621,4.980769230769231
4315113,5,B004BBMF98,"Everything was excellent in this program. The dancers were well coordinated, with precise and sharp moves, the lighting and backgrounds were realistic and well done, even the expressions on the performers' faces were clear and dynamic. While mostly subdued, the musical accompaniment rose to the occasion when required. The audience especially like the segment that involved three Chinese musicians with native instruments, combined with three others with traditional ones from Ireland. Also was very impressed by the venue - very large and attractive, and the audience - attentive and appreciative. A special short treat was the portion when a young Chinese girl in an aisle began mimicking the performers.",1291161600,11,707,5.495412844036697

4315118,3,B004BBMF98,"Big fan of Riverdance since its inception. This is the only hi-def recording available, so I had very high hopes. The performers are excellent. What is awful is the camera/editing. Not only do they spend way too much time looking at the awe-inspired faces of the audience, but most of this dancing is all about the feet, and for some reason they insist on spending ~1/2 the time focused on the torso/face. At times this is comical with people looking like they are floating around on the screen. This isn't a bloody opera! It's a dance. We need to see the whole body!!! They also seem to feel that the camera isn't doing its job if it isn't continually moving around.  Grr...",1456531200,,675,4.532786885245901

The editors probably don't understand dance productions or their audience.  The editors gave what seemed like nearly equal time to audience

4315133,4,B004BBMF98,"I've loved Riverdance ever since getting a VHS tape of the original show, and now own all the different incarnations.

This is a nice production, but there's not anything spectacular about it.  There aren't any dances that are exclusive to this DVD and I got a little vibe of ""same old, same old"".  But...there is a new element in that one song does include some Chinese musicians and musical themes.  That definitely is something different from any other Riverdance show.  As usual, there is a new pair of lead dancers for this show.  They do a good job, but there wasn't (at least to my mind) anything especially memorable about them--certainly not compared to the first two pairs of dancers in the series (Michael Flatley/Jean Butler, Colin Dunne/Jean Butler).  Also as usual is the costume redesigns: some good and others baffling.  Other reviewers have commented negatively about the numerous audience shots during the show; yes, there are a good number of them, but that's been true of every other Riverdance show and isn't an exclusive criticism for this one.

Still, it's a nice show that I'm glad to own to complete my Riverdance set,",1424649600,2,1143,4.850515463917525

4315147,3,B004BBMF98,"It was nicely done, and I didn't think there were to many audience shots. I agree the cast seemed smaller and I thought Colin Dunne and Jean Butler (River Dance at Radio City Music Hall) was a better performance overall. Also, I like the early performance of Ms. Pages in the Fire dance as well.  Having said that, this version was watchable.",1383609600,2,342,4.516129032258065
4315148,5,B004BBMF98,"OK, OK, OK, I'm a bit biased. Not only because my friend Kevin is in the cast of this amazing DVD, but because I have seen Riverdance performed live over 20 times and this DVD shows the travel, hard work and dedication of the dancers and musicians as well as the tech crew. It is fun to see all the behind the scenes goings on.

I was moved by how well received it was in Beijing where the people are under so much political control. You could see so much joy in their faces. My favorite scene is when they saw some Beijing youth dancing the same dance steps outside in a park one afternoon.

Riverdance isn't just ""an Irish dance show"". It is so much more. It has a story and depth and beauty and artistry. If you haven't seen it before--this would be an amazing introduction to the perfection that is Riverdance.",1383609600,,814,4.279220779220779

4315151,3,B004BBMF98,"The music and dancing were great, as one would expect, but the quality of the video was really lacking.  At times it was very badly pixelated.  I would expect something  of MUCH higher production quality.  It did seem to get better as we got deeper into the performance, but really, it's digital and should be crisp from start to finish.  At one point I thought maybe it was a VHS dub.",1368316800,2,385,4.366197183098592
4315152,3,B004BBMF98,"If you've seen the original Riverdance VHS tape this is about the same thing with different cast members. Two problems with the production are as follows:

1. Too many audience shots.
2. Staging is too dark. Dark backdrops, dark costumes, dark stockings, blue and purple spot lights. If I want to see what black looks like I'll just turn off the TV.

4315156,2,B004BBMF98,"I bought this DVD at a show and when I got home, I was extremely disappointed. The camera shots were, in my opinion, 75% too much audience and too much ceiling.

4315159,5,B004BBMF98,"This version of Riverdance was great.  However, I've seen all three and I like Live from Geneva best only because it is bigger and has more dancers.  From what I can tell, Beijing is more what you would see if you were to go to a live performance yourself.  However, the new variety that Beijing has (simply because it is in Beijing) with Chinese instruments is really refreshing and I loved seeing the audience.  They had the best and most excited expressions I've ever seen in a Riverdance audience.  The special features on this DVD are really great, you get to experience a little bit of what a Riverdance dancer's life is.  You also get some Riverdance history.

4315163,4,B004BBMF98,"Well, I saw ""Riverdance"" this afternoon with Caterina Coyne and Padraic Moyles, bought the DVD at the show, and then went home and watched it a second time - all in one day !!  Here are some observations (1) I still get tingles watching the most sensational acts, the finale for the first act, and the finale for the 2nd act, and then the reprise of the whole show directly afterward.  (2) There were a few things lost in translation to the video, (a) In the (new) battle between traditional tap dance and irish step dancing, the irish step dancers cross the stage ferociously, forcing the tappers off to the side of the stage, and this was lost by poor camera work, and secondarily, the tappers did some amazing toe-stands and 45-degree twirls that weren't really captured (or perhaps even performed) on the video.  This newer battle (vs original) between the tappers and steppers is a really cool modification of the original show.

I noticed (and presumed) that many irish compositions had influenced top-10 american hit songs of the past 30 years, and I found myself wishing for dramatic new dance routines to be choreographed to some of these sensational irish-inspired american songs (or alternately, new dance numbers to some newer irish music would be equally welcome.)

One great thing about the video is that it has close-ups of the leads, and they really are acting while they dance which is simply amazing.  And finally tonight, I reviewed the original 1995 show with michael flatley.  For me, the 1995 show was more amazing, but that's because nobody alive or dead can touch michael flatley for athleticism and flair and enthusiasm in hybrid irish/tap-dancing.  The present female riverdance lead is spectacularly beautiful and a great actor on this DVD, but for me, Jean Butler of the 1995 original is not only a red-headed wavy-haired celtic siren, but also dances with her arms straight down - not at her waist - which is waycool, and which looks different from the present production of riverdance.

On the DVD, some of the cuts to the chinese-audience reactions were actually downers or laughter-inspiring, which I think detracted from the DVD's message.

I went to the show hoping to see they had improved upon riverdance over the past 15 years.  I left - having felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up - at the same points today as 15 years ago when I first saw the show.  The DVD had some nice russian dances that weren't part of our live show, an arguable improvement.

Nevertheless, I have to conclude that Michael Flatley was right - the present producers have produced a new flavor of the original menu, but nothing has been found to equal the top-3 pieces of the original Riverdance.  There were a few less choral pieces and a lot more violin and drum solos, and less dancing, sadly.  Thankfully, the original show was so strong it was still enjoyable to watch it again, albeit 15 years since the last time I saw it.  If you see this one first it might become your favorite, but for me, this show is like STAR WARS I, II, II vs. IV, V, VI ~ I have to reserve my 5-star rating for the Butler-Flatley version.",1322956800,11,3139,4.659420289855072
8421859,5,B004BBMF98,"We bought this DVD because we had seen a live performance of Riverdance that week and wanted to sustain the feelings and enjoyment of the show. This is a good recording of a live show, that happened in Beijing, although it doesnt really matter where it was recorded because the basic show hasn't changed much since its beginning. The only thing different is that it Beijing there was included a segment featuring Chinese musicians playing traditional Chinese instruments and traditional music, which was a nice local addition.
If you like Celtic music and Irish step-dancing, then youll enjoy Riverdance. The music is haunting, the dancing flawless and energetic and the performances professional. Some of the dancers have been with the show for several years and have an obvious love for performing the show. That this is a video recording of a live show has pluses and minuses in that the camera isn't stationary, so you get views you wouldnt if you were in the live audience, but the camera movements were distracting at times.
This isn't the kind of DVD we would watch again and again, but neither Netflix or Amazon Prime has it available for rent and our local library, that used to have a VHS tape recording, no longer held it, so we bought it, watched it a couple of times and then donated it to the library so others could see it.

Not my favorite of the 4, but a good one and I am glad I bought it - any new recording of Riverdance would be challenged to equal the New York'96  or Geneva '02 productions and recordings.  I found the audio editing to be a bit heavy handed and a distraction; I kept finding I was anticipating a continued swell in the music to carry the emotion near the end of a number (as in all previous recordings, both music and video) and instead it waned.  Likewise, to emphasize a melody the percussion was suppressed more than I'd heard in the past.  I've heard some complain about the video editing - too focused on the audience - but I did not find this distracting, although it was more than in previous video recordings.
