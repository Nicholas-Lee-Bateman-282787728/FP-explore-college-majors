8474418,1,B005IAAIHW,"Alpha Video is still living in the 1980's when video companies could distribute garbage, and collectors accepted it. However, in these times with digital transfers, and the use of original print source material, the days of companies like Alpha are numbered. Sure these are harder to find Brown films, and yes the may only be available at present in the 16mm format, but Alpha's ""source material"" is a VHS transfer probably made in the late 1980's. Alpha consistently uses VHS tape, not even 3/4"" tape! Alpha distributes below par transfers for a profit, and collectors purchase them not knowing the history of this lousy company. BTW: Any of their good transfers are bootlegged from distributors like Image Entertainment, KINO or Flicker Alley. Why doesn't anyone take Alpha to task?",1484092800,4,784,5.0852713178294575

8474421,1,B005IAAIHW,"The movies themselves are fun. Typical Joe. E. Brown fare. However, the static sound is so bad on a couple of them you can barely make out the dialogue. The shape of the old film from which these were transferred is bad. This is the worst DVD product I've ever purchased.",1457481600,4,271,4.333333333333333
