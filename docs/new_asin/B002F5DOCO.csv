8368792,5,B002F5DOCO,I know that I watched this film with English subtitles or maybe it was in English with other subtitles but I am frustrated at not being able to find that version to own or even to watch again. The film was painful to watch as the subject matter was explicit as it needed to be. An important film for the poignancy of this journey knowing how it would end. I just wish I could find an English version again,1469404800,,405,4.139240506329114

8368795,5,B002F5DOCO,"It is a good dramatization of anguish, suffering and despair experienced by the Jews during deportations in Nazi Germany. Something that was repeated again and again in every country taken by the Germans. This must not be allowed to happen again ever. Good movie for the budget.",1426464000,,278,4.9361702127659575
8368796,1,B002F5DOCO,"Be careful!!!  Appears to only be in Spanish!!!!???  Despite America forcing kids in 2nd grade to learn Spanish, allowing non-English speaking illegal immigrants to continue speaking Spanish in America, and a huge percentage of American movies offering Spanish subtitles, the prejudiced / cheap producers of this film chose to not spend a few pennies to translate to English subtitle option.

Suggest boycotting to help teach the producers as many, many great Holocaust movies can be purchased on amzn.",1423094400,3,502,5.410256410256411

8368798,4,B002F5DOCO,"I'm very glad I stuck through this film for more than the first 15 minutes. The reason I think I should mention this is that the film seems slightly weak in the begining. There's something that seems a little artificial about the begining. I can't quite put my finger on it but it simply seemed a tad pushed or low budget perhaps. However once the film takes the audience onboard the train, things begin to take shape and then it's pretty intense from there all the way through to the end. The film does an admirable job detailing what it must have been like for the unfortunate passengers on the death trains that carried them to the concentration camps. In fact as the film progresses over a period of probably a week as the Jews begin to suffer it's very heartbreaking and unsettling. It's also truly effective. One thing I had a problem with is that the nazi's almost amways heavily packed these trains with so many people that it would have been very difficult to move around freely as the passengers on this train were able to. That was simply not realistic at all. But I think it was probably a creative choice that had to be made in order to tell the story effectivly. But at the same time it calls into question the plausibility of some of the subject matter and if it were even possible. Escape attempts with the use of tools smuggled onboard is a very unlikely event given the truth of what really happened within those trains and how the Nazi's would have never allowed such opportunities to even present themselves. None the less this story is truly riveting. I was also very impressed with the young actress, Lena Beyerling who played the brave Nina. She is an important addition to why this story worked so well, and her understated performance keeps things interesting. The film falls short of being a masterpiece or classic, but it's still very good.",1367625600,5,1867,4.576119402985075
