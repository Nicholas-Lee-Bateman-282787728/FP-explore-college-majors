It has everything--the simple act of authentic kindness that leads to such profound repercussions that you will feel them resonate in your soul.  Ms. Hattendorf, thank you for your artistry and your humanity.  Keep that camera rolling! Jimmy-san, you are a true sensei!  Keep painting and teaching!

3092824,5,B0012OTVQC,"What probably started as curiosity and sympathy turns into a life experience of discovery, friendship and love - the real kind. Beautiful, haunting, true to the human spirit. This is a moving story about a street person, Jimmy Mirikitani, who turns out to be a grand master artist running from a past of the cruelties of the American Japanese internment camps. He is a passionate artist, with dual citizenship, who was born in American, educated in Japan, and eventually came back to America to pursue his passion - art, in his own style - a fusion of orient and occident. But after the cruel internment and losing his American citizenship in the process, he ends up with nothing, yet desperately continues his art. With no sense of placement in any country, he begins living on the fringes of American society. When his luck runs out, he ends up on the street. This is where the story begins. He carries a quiet anger and bitterness, yet never for one moment does he sway from his deep seeded commitment to his art. He has no self pity, he has only the integrity and beauty of the artistic vision within. The director starts filming, following his life, but then 9/11 happens and he has no where to go. She gives him a place to stay, and thus ensues the lively friendship that fills both of their lives with surprises, warmth, respect and eventually, true friendship. This ultimately offers Jimmy a vehicle for coming full circle - to a place of acceptance and healing. This is one of my favorite all-time documentaries - it's magic.",1222560000,26,1534,4.6642066420664205

This film was shown in a shorter version on Independent Lens but I would recommend the full-length video. The additional footage provides a more cohesive story and to be honest - even at 90 minutes I still did not want it to end.
Thanks go to Linda Hattendorf for allowing us to share in this story of giving and healing and peace.

3092827,5,B0012OTVQC,"This documentary was a bit pricey, but my goodness, well worth it. After befriending Jimmy Mirikitani, the filmmaker takes us on a journey from homelessness, through the tragedy of 9/11, through Jimmy's rightful hatred for the US government (oddly enough, later on in the film he's seen wearing a baseball cap with the American flag and eagle on it!), meeting his long-lost family,  revisiting the internment camp he was held captive in in Tula Lake, his acceptance of his status as an America citizen and placement in a assisted living apartment using his social security, and (through the special features) his eventual return to Hiroshima for a visit on the national day of mourning. I just finished the film and it is fresh in my mind. Tears were shed. A very emotional and rewarding documentary that I can highly recommend to everyone. Definitely a film that will remain in your heart, because it makes entry.",1211587200,14,914,4.896774193548387
3092828,5,B0012OTVQC,"I was fortunate to see this film during its premiere run at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 (where it won the Audience Award) and have been looking for a chance to see it again ever since! What starts out as an examination of a year in the life of Jimmy Mirikitani, a homeless artist in NYC, becomes a different story when the events of 9/11 prompt the documentarian (Linda Hattendorf) to cease being just an observer and become personally involved in her subject's story. The resulting revelations of Mirikitani's personal history and treatment as a Japanese-American during WWII are heartbreaking and eye opening, which makes the process that he & Hattendorf go through in an attempt to heal old wounds and get him back on his feet even more inspirational.  I've very rarely been as moved by a film as I was by this one.  I can't recommend it highly enough!!",1210896000,7,862,4.6644736842105265
3092829,5,B0012OTVQC,"Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani is truly a ""Master Artist."" His art and desire to share his craft was twice interrupted by war. Luckily for Jimmy, film maker Linda Hattendorf opened her heart and her home to this once ignored and now revered American artist.

Easily a BEST OF 2007, FIVE STAR documentary.",1210550400,6,298,4.8431372549019605
3092830,5,B0012OTVQC,"It's a real shame that almost no one saw this film (it never got a wide theatrical release), because it's my pick for the best film of 2007.  Without giving too much away, it's a fascinating documentary about Jimmy Mirikitani, an elderly NYC steet artist of Japanese descent who is befriended, and ultimately taken in off the streets, by the documentarian herself, Linda Hattendorf.

As Linda gets to know Jimmy, and tries to find him a permanent place to live, she begins to find out about his past through his drawings and conversations with him.  Meanwhile, they both experience the aftermath of 9/11 together, which reminds Jimmy of how America responded to an earlier surprise attack on American soil, and the dramatic turn of events it caused in his own life...

The Cats of Mirikitani is a deeply moving film about one person's compassion for another, a friendship that develops between them, and the fascinating unearthing of Jimmy Mirikitani's personal history.  While it is primarily a personal film, it can't help but also touch on the political aspects of how our nation reacts in times of crisis, and the rippling effects this can have many years later.  Jimmy Mirikitani's art is revealed as subtle political commentary based on his own poignant personal experiences.

This is a must-see film for documentary lovers and anyone who's interested in the human condition.  I give it my strongest possible recommendation - do not miss The Cats of Mirikitani.",1202860800,45,1467,4.983606557377049

He was living on the streets in Manhattan while turning out wonderful expressive pictures when she, a young filmmaker bought one from him and began photographing him. Then 9/11 happened and she invited him to come and stay in her tiny apartment.

3092851,5,B0012OTVQC,"I've watched this documentary two times now. The first time, the short version which had all the essential scenes. The second time, the director's cut, they left in more scenes of daily life (which I liked). This is such a warm, sweet film. Jimmy Mirikitani, though homeless, is a funny, good, nice, old man, dedicated to his art. He has a life story to tell about being born in Sacramento, being interned at Tule Lake during WWII, and his ancestry from Hiroshima. He likes to sing, watch Samurai movies, and is always drawing (even on the streets).

The film director, Linda Hattendorf, did a wonderful thing by changing Jimmy's life - helping him find housing, getting him connected with his sister and relatives, helping him apply for social security, and getting his U.S. citizenship back. It's just really sweet.

One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Jimmy worried about Linda after she came home late from a night out.

I highly recommend this film - I loved it. It shows real human connection, and there are colorful drawings by Jimmy throughout.",1349308800,2,1063,4.766304347826087

3092853,5,B0012OTVQC,"We found ""Cats of Mirikitani"" to be stimulating and captivating, for the story of artist Jimmy Mirikitani is really several stories all in one.  The broad story line is how the Japanese internment during World War II had long-lasting effects.  But it is also the story of national betrayal.  Jimmy, a US citizen born in Sacramento, California, was encouraged or coerced into renouncing his citizenship during his internment at Tulelake Internment camp.  Additionally, at the time of internment, he was separated from his older sister, who went to another camp and whose fate remained unknown to him for nearly 50 years.  What he did not know was that the courts had, years later, ruled his renunciation of citizenship null and void.

The more immediate story line is of Jimmy, a street artist living on the streets of New York City at the time of 9/11.  After a lifetime of making do with various jobs, and having outlived several of his employers, he was very much alone and isolated.  Linda Hattendorf, a documentary maker, befriended him and eventually invited him into her flat to escape the dust from the 9/11 attack.  Slowly, subtly, she opens up Jimmy's closed self, researching to find that his renunciation was not valid, encouraging his art, suggesting he would be a good art teacher at the senior center, finding his long-lost sister, helping him move into a low-cost rental for senior citizens, and taking him to a reunion of internees at Tulelake.

Through all this, Jimmy moves from his angry self to his happier gentler self.  The horrific events of 9/11 were a catalyst for Jimmy to find peace with a past that had seen him incarcerated merely because he was a west coast man of Japanese ancestry who had been angered by the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, where he had once lived before returning to the U. S.  In short, the film is a story of redemption, release, and healing.

The film should be required viewing in our high schools to put a human face to what is usually a few paragraphs in a U. S. history text.",1315526400,3,2030,4.71671388101983

3092855,5,B0012OTVQC,"This story of an artist of Japanese descent who was interned at Tule Lake during WWII is one of the most well-done documentaries I have seen.  Mirikitani was essentially a street person when the filmmaker discovered him shortly before the World Trade bombings.  She tells his story and becomes entwined with his life in a way that is very touching, sensitive, and at times hilarious.  The film itself is full of very artistic camera work, has a lovely soundtrack, and ties together the themes of art, war, bigotry & redemption in a truly transcendent manner.",1276732800,3,558,4.852631578947369

3092858,5,B0012OTVQC,"That man you just passed on the street, the one wearing four layers of clothing and a month's worth of human smell stench? Yeah him. Do you know who he is? Or what his history might be?

These are the questions that suddenly plague New York director and documentarian Linda Hattendorf. Seeing one of these nameless faces wandering near where she lived, Linda decided to place her lens on him. His name, she quickly learns, is Jimmy Mirikitani, and his story is almost too much to believe.

A sidewalk artist who's specialty involved drawing Japanese cats and portraits of his wartime experiences, Jimmy is a complex and talented man. And when the 9/11 attacks occur only a few blocks away from Jimmy's normal homeless home-spot, Linda takes him in so that he doesn't have to choke on the dust littering the skies immediately after the collapse of the twin towers. The attacks on the twin towers also begin echoing prejudices against Muslim Americans, a prejudice that Jimmy is far too familiar with.

As Linda's cameras continue to record Jimmy's life, we learn that not only was Jimmy a peace loving man before WW II, but he also was an up-and-coming artist ...until he and his family were forced into Japanese internment camps in California. Everything was stripped away from Jimmy, including (or so he thought) his U.S. citizenship. As Linda tries to help Jimmy both mentally and financially, she runs up against Jimmy's anger and distrust of the government. Jimmy constantly refuses her requests to find out if he's eligible for social security, often sparking outbursts against the U.S. bureaucracy. His anger, it soon become apparent, is due to his internment time, his forced signing of documents relinquishing his U.S. citizen status (even though he was born in Sacramento, California), and the WW II bombing of his beloved Hiroshima (his hometown).

In his 80s, Jimmy also doesn't know what's happened to his family. He soon learns that he has plenty living in California. But opening up to them is not an easy road as his obvious mental illness intrudes upon his better judgement.

It is a poignant and memorable documentary for the simple reason that a person took the time to get to know this homeless man and uncovered a goldmine of information about an incredible person and an artist. His images are strikingly beautiful and haunting, harkening back to his time in the internment camps and his early career as a hopeful artist.

The story is what really sticks with you, too. As we watch Linda (the documentary maker) uncover layer after layer of this unique man, we don't pity him but, instead, begin to UNDERSTAND him. That's a huge revelation. We understand why Jimmy is so angry. Why he's so reluctant to get close to people. And why, eventually, he comes out of his lonesome cocoon. It is a rebirth worth watching ...and enjoying",1267920000,4,2849,4.851851851851852

What starts out as an examination of a year in the life of Jimmy Mirikitani, a homeless artist in NYC, becomes a different story when the events of 9/11 prompt the documentarian (Linda Hattendorf) to cease being just an observer and become personally involved in her subject's story. The resulting revelations of Mirikitani's personal history and treatment as a Japanese-American during WWII are heartbreaking and eye opening, which makes the process that he & Hattendorf go through in an attempt to heal old wounds and get him back on his feet even more inspirational.  I've very rarely been as moved by a film as I was by this one.  I can't recommend it highly enough!!",1210896000,7,862,4.6644736842105265

3327327,5,B0012OTVQC,"It's a real shame that almost no one saw this film (it never got a wide theatrical release), because it's my pick for the best film of 2007.  Without giving too much away, it's a fascinating documentary about Jimmy Mirikitani, an elderly NYC steet artist of Japanese descent who is befriended, and ultimately taken in off the streets, by the documentarian herself, Linda Hattendorf.

As Linda gets to know Jimmy, and tries to find him a permanent place to live, she begins to find out about his past through his drawings and conversations with him.  Meanwhile, they both experience the aftermath of 9/11 together, which reminds Jimmy of how America responded to an earlier surprise attack on American soil, and the dramatic turn of events it caused in his own life...

The Cats of Mirikitani is a deeply moving film about one person's compassion for another, a friendship that develops between them, and the fascinating unearthing of Jimmy Mirikitani's personal history.  While it is primarily a personal film, it can't help but also touch on the political aspects of how our nation reacts in times of crisis, and the rippling effects this can have many years later.  Jimmy Mirikitani's art is revealed as subtle political commentary based on his own poignant personal experiences.

This is a must-see film for documentary lovers and anyone who's interested in the human condition.  I give it my strongest possible recommendation - do not miss The Cats of Mirikitani.",1202860800,45,1467,4.983606557377049

The second time, the director's cut, they left in more scenes of daily life (which I liked). This is such a warm, sweet film. Jimmy Mirikitani, though homeless, is a funny, good, nice, old man, dedicated to his art. He has a life story to tell about being born in Sacramento, being interned at Tule Lake during WWII, and his ancestry from Hiroshima. He likes to sing, watch Samurai movies, and is always drawing (even on the streets).

The film director, Linda Hattendorf, did a wonderful thing by changing Jimmy's life - helping him find housing, getting him connected with his sister and relatives, helping him apply for social security, and getting his U.S. citizenship back. It's just really sweet.

One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Jimmy worried about Linda after she came home late from a night out.

3327350,5,B0012OTVQC,"We found ""Cats of Mirikitani"" to be stimulating and captivating, for the story of artist Jimmy Mirikitani is really several stories all in one.  The broad story line is how the Japanese internment during World War II had long-lasting effects.  But it is also the story of national betrayal.  Jimmy, a US citizen born in Sacramento, California, was encouraged or coerced into renouncing his citizenship during his internment at Tulelake Internment camp.  Additionally, at the time of internment, he was separated from his older sister, who went to another camp and whose fate remained unknown to him for nearly 50 years.  What he did not know was that the courts had, years later, ruled his renunciation of citizenship null and void.

The more immediate story line is of Jimmy, a street artist living on the streets of New York City at the time of 9/11.  After a lifetime of making do with various jobs, and having outlived several of his employers, he was very much alone and isolated.  Linda Hattendorf, a documentary maker, befriended him and eventually invited him into her flat to escape the dust from the 9/11 attack.  Slowly, subtly, she opens up Jimmy's closed self, researching to find that his renunciation was not valid, encouraging his art, suggesting he would be a good art teacher at the senior center, finding his long-lost sister, helping him move into a low-cost rental for senior citizens, and taking him to a reunion of internees at Tulelake.

Through all this, Jimmy moves from his angry self to his happier gentler self.  The horrific events of 9/11 were a catalyst for Jimmy to find peace with a past that had seen him incarcerated merely because he was a west coast man of Japanese ancestry who had been angered by the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, where he had once lived before returning to the U. S.  In short, the film is a story of redemption, release, and healing.

The film should be required viewing in our high schools to put a human face to what is usually a few paragraphs in a U. S. history text.",1315526400,3,2030,4.71671388101983

These are the questions that suddenly plague New York director and documentarian Linda Hattendorf. Seeing one of these nameless faces wandering near where she lived, Linda decided to place her lens on him. His name, she quickly learns, is Jimmy Mirikitani, and his story is almost too much to believe.

A sidewalk artist who's specialty involved drawing Japanese cats and portraits of his wartime experiences, Jimmy is a complex and talented man. And when the 9/11 attacks occur only a few blocks away from Jimmy's normal homeless home-spot, Linda takes him in so that he doesn't have to choke on the dust littering the skies immediately after the collapse of the twin towers. The attacks on the twin towers also begin echoing prejudices against Muslim Americans, a prejudice that Jimmy is far too familiar with.

As Linda's cameras continue to record Jimmy's life, we learn that not only was Jimmy a peace loving man before WW II, but he also was an up-and-coming artist ...until he and his family were forced into Japanese internment camps in California. Everything was stripped away from Jimmy, including (or so he thought) his U.S. citizenship. As Linda tries to help Jimmy both mentally and financially, she runs up against Jimmy's anger and distrust of the government. Jimmy constantly refuses her requests to find out if he's eligible for social security, often sparking outbursts against the U.S. bureaucracy. His anger, it soon become apparent, is due to his internment time, his forced signing of documents relinquishing his U.S. citizen status (even though he was born in Sacramento, California), and the WW II bombing of his beloved Hiroshima (his hometown).

In his 80s, Jimmy also doesn't know what's happened to his family. He soon learns that he has plenty living in California. But opening up to them is not an easy road as his obvious mental illness intrudes upon his better judgement.

It is a poignant and memorable documentary for the simple reason that a person took the time to get to know this homeless man and uncovered a goldmine of information about an incredible person and an artist. His images are strikingly beautiful and haunting, harkening back to his time in the internment camps and his early career as a hopeful artist.

The story is what really sticks with you, too. As we watch Linda (the documentary maker) uncover layer after layer of this unique man, we don't pity him but, instead, begin to UNDERSTAND him. That's a huge revelation. We understand why Jimmy is so angry. Why he's so reluctant to get close to people. And why, eventually, he comes out of his lonesome cocoon. It is a rebirth worth watching ...and enjoying",1267920000,4,2849,4.851851851851852
