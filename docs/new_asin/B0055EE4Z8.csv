8458144,2,B0055EE4Z8,"I'm not entirely sure what Ms. Guin's intentions for this DVD were but I was very disappointed with it.  Here original DVD was absolutely amazing and I strongly encourage all massage therapist and students to purchase it.  But this video seemed pretty pointless by comparison.  Ms. Guin did not demonstrate any new massage techniques in this DVD and her instruction of those techniques were very sub par.  The thing that really irked me about this DVD was the camera work. It seemed like they spent too much time setting up a pretty stage and nice looking massage tables and sheets than developing a good video.  Most of the camera shots were from so far away that you could not see what she was doing very well.  There were times were the camera man even positioned himself on the far side of the model so your view was completely blocked.  This DVD did have some conditioning exercises for the massage therapist, but that extra did not come even close to justifying this DVD.  Overall this DVD was not worth it's large price tag.  Just buy the first DVD.  It was more extensive and shot much better.",1333238400,17,1101,4.6
