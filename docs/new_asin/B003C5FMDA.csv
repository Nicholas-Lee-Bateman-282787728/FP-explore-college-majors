The pacing is quick so even the two year old doesn't get bored, but there is enough info to keep the bright seven year old interested.  I highly recommend Animal Atlas.",1349827200,5,255,4.382978723404255

8394086,5,B003C5FMDA,"My son watches Animal Atlas every single day, and they remain as popular as they were when first purchased a year ago.  We own all of the DVDs in the series.  The formula is simple but very effective - great footage of fun wild animals, paired with smart narration and facts about the animals.  Most of the footage is from zoos, farms, animal parks and aquariums rather than the wild, but that doesn't distract from the animals.  The adults enjoy watching them too - even after many, many viewings we still pick up some new facts from time to time.  There are trivia questions sprinkled throughout - my son's attention tends to wander during those moments, but they only last about 30 seconds and then it's back to the animal footage.  His favorite part is the short ""blooper reel"" of funny animal behaviors at the end of each episode.

Our son inevitably asks for his ""mals"" at least once a day - this video series has been a lifesaver, and he's learned lots of animals.  He ""talks"" to the animals and dances along with the parrots and pounds his chest with the gorillas, so it's a pretty interactive experience for him and we feel better having him watch and participate with these vs. just sitting passively like we've seen with some other videos.  I can't recommend these enough and only wish they had more episodes available on DVD!",1391385600,3,1337,4.584033613445378
8394087,5,B003C5FMDA,"My boys are two and have been asking for ""Animal Movies"" for months now.  I was using YouTube to give them small clips of things, but I had to monitor because the clips were either too short or too graphic.  I found these and they are perfect.  Currently they are a bit advanced for them, but that simply means they will last longer as part of our video library, but they do ask to watch them.  There are two DVDs in each box.  A great price for the product.",1390003200,4,458,4.101123595505618
