8414697,4,B0043CIAB2,"The story is sentimental, but good. The political environment of Pinochet's dictatorship was not clearly explained or depicted, making it difficult to place the personal story of main characters against the political situation in the country thus leaving somewhat unclear what apart from personal relations shaped the lives of the people.",1474848000,,338,5.647058823529412
8414698,5,B0043CIAB2,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It is Spanish (chile) and it has English subtitles. Even though there is some heavy stuff in it, the film feels very light and breezy.  It shows you the relationship between strangers that have nobody else.
 A young traumatized dancer, a young man that comes from a prison and a 50 year old man who also has just come out of prison. Great film, worth watching if you like foreign films.",1471996800,,414,4.363636363636363

8414700,4,B0043CIAB2,"""El baile de la Victoria"" is a 2010 Seattle International Film Festival entry from Spain (with English captions), although the story takes place in South America. It offers three of my favorites: 1) Ballet 2) Humor 3) Ricardo Darn.

We meet two fellows recently discharged from prison. One, played by Argentinean Darn (""The Secret in Their Eyes""), is a famous thief, a local legend who has sworn he will go straight after serving five years in prison for his crimes. His notoriety is obvious, people recognize his face and are eager to help him. The other, played by Argentinean Abel Ayala, is a young man who has just served a grueling two year prison term. This energetic guy is creative, funny, and resourceful. He provides the warmth and humor which cause us to care about the outcome. Either one of these men could be the eponymous thief.

The dancer is portrayed by Miranda Bodenhfer, who performs just enough that we buy the concept. Her character was traumatized as a child by her parents' kidnapping and murder during the political turmoil in Argentina during the late 70s and early 80s. As a result, she is mute and her best means to communicate is through dance.

Our young hero falls for her instantly and immediately devises a way for her to audition for the premier ballet company. At the same time, he is concocting a fool-proof heist for his role model/idol, the legendary thief.

What they do, how they do it, and what results, is why we watch movies like this. And we ARE invested in the outcome!

BIG CAVEAT! This is NOT available in Region 1 format. I got my All-Region DVD player from Amazon.com.",1335139200,5,1617,4.679577464788732
8414701,4,B0043CIAB2,"Two well different cons are indulged. One of them is Vergara a renowned expert about all related with vaults, the other one is a nave young man -Angel Santiago-who seldom is in his early twenties who idolizes Vergara.

When Angel meets Victoria a true twist of fate will change dramatically the history of both guys.

Tender and imaginatively well made script, that combines humor and visual poetry all the way through. Masterfully directed by Fernando Trueba one of the most solvent Spanish filmmakers at this moment.

Crime and redemption.",1290988800,,541,5.056179775280899
