8336955,5,B001R10BAA,"A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002 and was disappointed when the show was canceled in 2007 after four excellent seasons. (The show was later renewed in 2012 by Destination America.)

I was pretty excited to find A Haunting-Twilight of Evil. The cover art is pretty cool and I was thinking these were new episodes. No Such Luck. The four episodes in this set: Where Evil Lurks, Stalked By Evil, Dark Wrath, and Legend Trippers are creepy. They are presented in 1.33 full frame and spread across two dvds. This would be great except all the episodes are from the previously released Season Four.

So BEWARE! If you own the Season Four Box Set, there is no reason to spend your money on this. This might be good as an inexpensive gift for someone but If you don't own any of A Haunting Sets, I'd recommend buying the season sets that over this sampler.",1428796800,,922,4.548192771084337

8336957,5,B001R10BAA,"The stories are spooky.  What is really unbelievable is that the format and information these stories use, are in no way as scary as the real story found in books about the hauntings.

If you own any other HAUNTING SERIES DVD'S, be sure that you are not buying the same stories, packaged under a different title.  Check the stories names before ordering.  OR get the Series 1-4.  It is great fun!!",1257638400,5,397,4.535211267605634
8336958,1,B001R10BAA,This Program is only 4 episodes of the regular series. Not Worth it! You can buy the whole season for about the same price.,1256688000,9,123,4.166666666666667
