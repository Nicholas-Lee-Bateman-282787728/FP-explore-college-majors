I still feel like this title is missing something important since there is no Japanese audio track and subtitling, but still a great series.
As for the episodes on this disk, we have three episodes that each deal with the capture of one time shifter, and one episode that acts like something of a recap, to give people a good idea about what has gone on in the series so far. Each episode is very cute and enjoyable, and the characters are fun and colorful, as always!
A great release to add to your collection if you like 'cute' anime like I do. ^_^",1086307200,,767,4.370629370629371
