8748472,5,B01AU02AW0,"In the Erato DVD of Leonardo Vinci's Artaserse, countertenor Franco Fagioli's extraordinary vocal pyrotechnics as Arbace stole the show from his better-known countertenor colleague Philippe Jarousky in the title tole. J.A. Hasse's setting of the same libretto by Pietro Metastasio premiered exactly one week after the debut of Vinci's version, in February 1730. Metastasio's highly effective libretto was subsequently used by many other composers, including Gluck, Cimarosa & Paisiello.

Arbace's father, Artabano, has assassinated Persia's king Serse (Xerxes). Arbace is accused of the murder, creating painful rifts within two pairs of lovers: Arbace & Serses's daughter Mandane, & Semira, sister & Artaserse, Serses's son. Artabano plans to ,murder Artaserse, the new king, but his villainy is exposed, the lovers are reunited &all ends happily.

In this 2-DVD set from the 2012 Valle d'Itria festival, Fagioli again thrills as Arbace, with breathtaking coloratura runs. Also excelling in vocal expressiveness & agility are mezzo-soprano Sonia Prina (Artabano) & rich-voiced contralto Rosa Bove (Semira). Hasse's emotion-laden ABA arias are augmented by a virtuoso aria from Vivaldi's Motezuma, added to give Prina as Artabano an extra showpiece. There's no resemblance to ancient Persia: the male characters wear gaudily bemedalled modern military uniforms. One annoyance: endlessly repeated cutaway views of Corrado Rovaris conducting from the harpsichord.

Hasse's Artaserse will surely please lovers of Baroque opera, superb singing &, especially, the growing contingent of fans of the amazing Franco Fagioli.",1515542400,2,1616,5.897435897435898
