8351396,5,B0025X1EN2,"This is a personal favorite of mine, and is STILL available (new) directly from Greater Vision ( [...] ) and Legacy Five ( [...] )  This is one of those rare concerts that you can watch again and again, and see something different.  There's so much interaction between Roger Bennett and me, plus the other stuff going on in the background...it's priceless!  There's LOTS of great songs on this DVD too!  It's a classic!",1283212800,2,419,4.621621621621622
