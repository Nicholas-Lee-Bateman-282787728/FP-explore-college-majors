172392,4,0963494708,My friend is a teacher and she uses this video with her 2nd grade class.  They love it.  I like the fact that the kids in the video exhibit so much joy in exercising.  It's contagious.,950227200,6,184,4.055555555555555
172393,5,0963494708,I gave this tape to my niece and she loved it.  We had the greatest time together laughing and dancing with the animated creatures.  My niece keeps inviting my over for more...,949881600,,176,4.46875
172394,5,0963494708,EXERCISE WITH YOUR KIDS AND ENJOY ENJOY.  IT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET THE KIDS AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER AND/OR TV AND GET A LITTLE MORE OXYGEN TO THEIR BRAIN CELLS.  IT'S FUN AND HEALTHY,948931200,2,180,4.114285714285714
172395,5,0963494708,"THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT VIDEO TO KEEP THE WHOLE FAMILY ACTIVE IN ADDITION, PARENTS CAN GET THEIR KIDS INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT GET THEM INTO TROUBLE...ACTIVE KIDS WILL NOT BE BORED KIDS...AS A CHILD DEVELOPMENT  SPECIALIST, I RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO TO ANYONE WHO VALUES A CHILD'S  ""WHOLISTIC"" DEVELOPMENT PATTERN.",948672000,4,324,5.211538461538462
172396,5,0963494708,What a great video this is!  My kids have been watching it over and over again.  It's so different than all the other ones out there.  I highly recommend it.,948672000,,157,4.166666666666667
172397,5,0963494708,"My grandchildren, from age 2 to 8, just loved it.  They were first caught up in the music and then began exercising with the children on the video.  When the animation came on they were laughing and having a wonderful time.  I believe this is the most effective exercise video for children I have  ever seen and am sure it one of the most positive forces in videos for my  precious grandchildren.  Hurray for the makers of this wonderful product.",948672000,12,446,4.5125
172398,5,0963494708,I love hip hop animal rock because it helps me stretch and I have lots of fun dancing to the music. I am 6 1/2 years old.,948499200,3,121,3.5185185185185186
172399,5,0963494708,"This video was fun and education for my cousin. She loved it, and has told all of her friends about it. She does the exercises almost everyday. I highly suggest this video to all parents who think there kids don't get  enough exercise.",948412800,8,235,4.465116279069767
172400,1,0963494708,"I would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people.  The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often.  It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult.  I couldn't imagine how kids could.  The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync.  I would recommend ""Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids"" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun.",1151366400,17,507,3.883495145631068
172401,3,0963494708,"This may sound stupid, but I didn't realize this would be solely aerobics.  My 6-year old daughter likes the video and asks for it, but frequently sits out.  She is discouraged because she has my coordination (or lack thereof).  I was hoping this was an engaging video that encouraged movement and imitation.  I didn't realize it would be so formatted.  If it weren't for our lack of ability with aerobics, I'm sure I would rate this video higher.  However, both my daughter and I spent more time tripping.  And my sons (age 4 1/2 and 2 1/2) stopped playing when I put the video in.  However within two minutes they were ignoring it and playing with other toys.  Sadly, for my purposes it was a failure.",1148515200,14,703,4.515873015873016
172402,5,0963494708,"When my 3 daughters (aged 6, 9 and 11) first got this video, they thought it was ""baby-ish""- they even mocked the ""animal"" moves instead of joining in; however, the next day, early in the morning I caught the middle one hopping to the music and cheerfully trying it out!! the little one soon joined in (the 11 year old still refuses to, of course).. ever since they tried it, I wake up to the sound of the ""elephant"", which cracks them up EVERY morning- it sure beats other sounds that used to beam through the TV set those lazy summer mornings!!!",1124236800,12,547,4.372549019607843
172403,5,0963494708,The animation and music is fantastic.  My kids and I really enjoyed the dance/workout.,1104796800,7,86,5.142857142857143
172404,2,0963494708,"I was not impressed with this video.  Although it is well made the children found it much too difficult and gave up.  I have played it for them several times, and they always begin with enthusiasm, but soon lose interest because the dances are much too hard for the little ones (ages 2-6)  Maybe this would be a good video for older children, but ""Chicken Fat"" still gets my favorite children's exercise video review.",1096070400,9,417,4.608108108108108
172405,2,0963494708,"I use this with my second-graders, but they don't like it. The instructor goes from step to step too fast, and the kids can't keep up.",1060041600,9,134,4.1923076923076925
172406,1,0963494708,I am an elementary physical education teacher with a dance background.  I have taught adult aerobic classes and have choreographed aerobic dances for children.  This video is too fast for children.  It is hard for an adult.  I saw the first dance and could not believe that this was for children 5 and up!,1052092800,19,305,4.592592592592593
172407,5,0963494708,"I teach part time at an elementary school.  This year I introduced my students to aerobics, using a variety of methods. (step, Taebo, and floor aerobics)  My students really enjoyed Hip Hop Animal Rock Workout, and were amazed at what a good workout it was.  This spring the students will put on a show of movement activities they have experienced over the year.  My 3rd grade class will be showing Hip Hop Animal Rock as their preformed number, as they loved it.",1012780800,10,463,4.609756097560975
172408,5,0963494708,"My daughters love this video, especially my 5-year-old.  They don't do everything ""perfectly,"" but they have a lot of fun trying.
I loaned it to the babysitters at my gym, and they thought it was great it too.  They got all 8 kids bouncing around.  I appreciated that my daughters were exercising while I was.",1011139200,4,309,4.581818181818182
7793688,5,0963494708,Great workout for kids and adults,1493424000,,33,4.666666666666667
7793689,3,0963494708,Good kids video.....,1404777600,,20,6.0
7793690,5,0963494708,I actually had the VHS of this when I was a kid and I absolutely loved it.  I remember running to put it in at absolutely random moments.  It was probably the most enthusiastic I have ever been about working out lol.  I love the sight of my daughter doing the same thing I did 15 years ago.  It brings back a lot of memories.  It is a way for her to have fun and get some exercise in as well so it is a definite benefit.  GREAT VIDEO!!,1223337600,,435,3.831460674157303
7793691,4,0963494708,This was a great workout for 2nd grade on up.  It was a little too fast for littler children.  The outfits are outdated and takes away from the excercise.  The older students  thought it was cheesy but I found the exercises fun and the students enjoyed them once they stopped laughing at the outfits.,1206489600,2,300,4.5
7793692,4,0963494708,"My daughter is 6 and enjoyed this DVD. The movements were not too advanced that she could not follow along, and she was still tired at the end. Good to get them off the couch!",1193011200,,175,4.0285714285714285
7793693,2,0963494708,"The moves they did, my five yr could not do and she is usually pretty good at learning how to do things quickly.  She was bored within the first 8 minutes of it.  The Denise Austin for Kids is much better.  She enjoyed that one much more and was able to do the things Denise showed.

This dvd Hip Hop was a waste of my money.",1179705600,3,325,3.878787878787879
7793694,2,0963494708,I bought this for my 9-year-old who loves animals and work out videos. This one was a combination of too silly and too difficult. Perhaps it would be better for a younger child who is already a dancer.,1179187200,,201,4.315789473684211
7793695,1,0963494708,"I ordered this DVD looking for an exercise video I could do with my toddlers on those long, indoor, winter afternoons.  I picked this one, because my kids are obsessed with animals in the rainforest.

Well, other than the weird bird, there was little animal portion of this video.  That was not thrilling, but fine.  The killer for me, was that this video was so clearly made in the late eighties/early nineties and is SO cheesy!  Think Alyssa MIlano Teen Steam, but 10 times cheesier.

So the cheese factor I could handle if my kids enjoyed it.  However, the dance moves were SO complicated and the music SO bad, I just pulled the plug quickly.",1174608000,2,645,4.556521739130435
7793696,5,0963494708,"I purchased this workout video for my 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter, and we love it.  It's fast pace, definitely not boring.  They liked that the kids on the screen were participating and having fun.  We do it together and have a great time!",1168300800,,250,4.166666666666667
7793697,5,0963494708,Myself as much as my youngest daughter & neices love this DVD.  The enjoy the work out and I love hearing them laugh at eachother as they do their workout.  It lets me know that they are having fun. and enjoy what they do.,1151884800,2,222,4.0227272727272725
