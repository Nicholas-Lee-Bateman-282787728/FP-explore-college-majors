There was no script per se but there was an outline. Just to put that to rest. We shot it over two days out of Stonington Ct (Dodson's Boatyard) and I was pretty much just available for the weekend so got the ""part"".

It is basic with filming quirks of the 80's that bring a smile today.  At the end of the day however a lot of useful tips and bits and pieces a new person to cruising can put to good use.

At one point John reprimanded me for how I was tying off to a piling, then showed me how to do it ""properly"" (He was right).  I will never forget and to this day each time I find myself doing the same I smile. He was pretty cool and a very interesting man. I've been sailing and cruising ever since, crossed Pacific in 05, back in the Bahamas these days. If you have the bug give it a watch and have a laugh :-)

7974852,5,B00007AJDB,"As I write this, there is just one other review of this video submitted by Jerry Clifft. I disagree with his review on just about every point. He stated there seemed to be no script, but I found just the opposite. It starts out with John Rousmaniere demonstrating how to plot the navigation for a short day trip across Long Island Sound, and then the rest of the video shows that trip being made while John instructs two student crew members. They go through the basics of raising the sails, nautical terminology and sailing the boat. The rest of Mr. Clifft's criticism is about trivial matters of production without pointing out that the film provides a great deal of useful information about sailing and  determining your position while underway. You don't learn to sail by watching DVDs but this lesson will make your learning experience much easier. I found it very helpful.",1213920000,6,878,4.776315789473684
7974853,1,B00007AJDB,"I have to rank this film a little on the low side.
The film itself contained some pretty pictures of boats and a little usefull knowledge covering multiple topics. However the it appears that no script existed for this film, a fly by the seat of your pants type of operation, make it up as you go and so forth. Combine the lack of script with poor camera angles, lousy audio editing and orange box around the screen, I would classify this as an ameture project.",1078876800,12,461,4.372093023255814
