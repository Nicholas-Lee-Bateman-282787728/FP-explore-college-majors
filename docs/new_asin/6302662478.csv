491835,5,6302662478,"First of all, I must address the use of the names. It is perfectly understandable that some of the victims' names were not used on this. The reason being that this is still a very sensitive subject for the many that felt the results of Bundy's crimes. He may be dead, but the toll of destruction Bundy has caused cannot be so easily erased by time. I found this to be a good movie because it showed how Det. Keppel, now a PhD, had dealt with the greusome details of this case. It showed the terrible job that police had when they had the terrible duty of telling the parents that their child was not coming home. Bundy is also shown in a somewhat glorified light, except when committing his crimes. It may have been only suggested, but if you really want to see the brutallity of his crime, watch the movie ""Ted Bundy"" or ""The Riverman"" which had reference to one of Bundy's crimes in graphic detail. If one is concerned about the names, read Richard Larsen's book bearing the same title, as well as Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me."" and a few other books on Bundy. You'll find those are graphic enough. One has to realize that this was made for Television, and for its time it was brutal enough. Bundy's victims weren't Only the ones he killed, but those affected by his crimes. The police, the families, husbands, parents, and lovers. I watched this movie, and the one thing it Did depict was the pain caused by Bundy. After watching some of the films of the same subject matter, I found this one quite accurate. If one is looking for the greusome details, look into the books on said subject. Take this movie for what it was, an observation.",1147305600,29,1647,4.438943894389439
491836,3,6302662478,"Me & my mum saw this a fair while ago & i was wondering where i could get it on video, but about the movie, Mark Harmon plays a brilliant role in it, the only gripe i would have is that there isn't much violence in it, it's more about the cops side of the story. The only violent scene is when he grabs the piece of wood & caves the heads in of the college girls. All in all, Mark Harmon has a good look of Ted Bundy in him, but it could be a better true story of Bundy. Look at the recent Ted Bundy movie for more of a sick portrayal of a serial killer.",1122508800,3,554,3.7033898305084745
491837,3,6302662478,"This movie was a little dissapointing. Especially since I had to search high and low for a copy of it. I felt it was really rushed. I realize that they had a lot of Bundy's life to get through, however, they started out with the Lake Sammammish murders and skipped over the first few. I must agree that Mark Harmon did an exceptional job. I'm not sure they could have found a better on screen Bundy. It wasn't terribly accurate but it wasn't completely off either. I wish they would have made a movie from Ann Rule's, The Stranger Beside Me. That would have made for a much more interesting plot. Her book was amazing. If anything, I would recommend this movie just to see Mark Harmon's performance. His good looks and unmistakable charm really held this movie together. In Ann Rule's book, after this movie was released she said that she was getting so many letters from girls saying they were in love with Ted and they wanted to help him. She told them that they weren't in love with Ted Bundy, they were in love with Mark Harmon. Now I know what she meant.",1110585600,10,1059,4.408163265306122
491838,1,6302662478,"I do not like the way this television movie portrayed Officer
David Lee, the Pensacola, Florida police officer who arrested
Bundy on February 15, 1978. The real Officer Lee was a true
policeman who was dedicated to doing his job. This movie made
him out to be a blue-uniformed bully who went around beating up
on suspects and who seems to enjoy doing it. This movie stinks!",1018915200,4,373,4.582089552238806
491839,2,6302662478,"This movie is very entertaining but very dangerous for Bundy is here portrayed by the very nice and attractive Mark Harmon and he doesn't manage to reflect the cruelty, madness and hatred that sum bundy up. You get the idea he killed a few girls but when you read Ann Rule's book, you envison all the horror that's not reflected in the movie and whose abscence is an insult to the victims and their relatives. How can furthermore one call himself a bundyphile, what a sick comment to make. We are talking about a serial killer, a cruel, vicious murderer who terrified many young ladies and destroyed families.",993772800,10,609,4.648148148148148
491840,5,6302662478,"Like many other people who saw this movie, I think Mark Harmon did a sensational job capturing Bundy's personality.  As a psychology major, I was impressed with how Mark portrayed Bundy's charming, attractive exterior and the emptiness, frustration, and hatred simmering beneath the surface.  Unfortunately, many of Mark's roles have merely exploited his good looks instead of capturing his talent, but here he deserves all of the praise he received for his performance.  I like the fact that they also showed what the families of the victims and the police working on the case went through.  To sum it up, an impressively accurate and captivating movie.",988502400,41,654,5.1415094339622645
491841,4,6302662478,"Mark Harmon gives an intense performance as Ted Bundy, accused of murdering girls in Washington, Utah, and Colorado.  On the surface, Bundy was an attractive and charming law student with a taste for political involvement.  Underneath his disarming mask was a man who liked to bludgeon, strangle, and sexually violate young women who fell for his facade.  The story begins in 1974, when he begins killing in earnest, and wraps up in 1978 when he's recaptured after his (second) prison escape.  Ann Rule, friend of Bundy and author of the book ""The Stranger Beside Me""  was inundated with letters after this broadcast from girls who professed a love for ""Ted"".  Rule patiently wrote them back, explaining that it was Mark Harmon who made their wheels turn.  Hopefully they realized that Bundy's charisma was lethal.  Richard Larsen, a friend of Ted's from Seattle, wrote the book upon which this mini-series was based.",988070400,5,917,5.026490066225166
491842,2,6302662478,"I read the other reviews and I'm not sure what everyone else got so excited about. The movie opens with what I can only assume is the stalking of Georgeann Hawkins; I say ""assume"" because none of the victims are called by their true names---with the notable exception of Denise Naslund (and her mother Eleanor Rose), one of the Lake Sam victims.
Bundy's earlier victims (Lynda Healy, Susan Rancourt, Donna Manson, and Brenda Ball, among others) are barely mentioned. Details of the Utah and Colorado murders (Melissa Smith, Laura Aime, and Caryn Campbell) are mixed up with other victims or just plain wrong. I found this distracting, as I caught myself spending time trying to figure out which pseudonym belonged to which victim.
Robert Keppel, also called by his real name, gives some interest to the story as we follow his efforts to not only catch Bundy, but to establish a computer database to store, sort, and cross-index all the crime data, which did eventually help lead to Bundy's capture, and was the forerunner of the FBI's VICAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) database of today.
Mark Harmon's performance was good, although he does seem a little too wholesome for the role.
If you're interested in this movie to learn more about Ted Bundy (as I was), I would recommend instead A&E's Biography, or reading Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me"" or Michaud & Aynesworth's ""The Only Living Witness.""",980726400,9,1414,4.945378151260504
491843,5,6302662478,"This is undoubtedly the finest performance of Mark Harmon's career, as he more than adequately steps into the shoes to play the part of Ted Bundy, probably the most notorious serial killer of the twentieth century.  He  effortlessly captures Bundy's on the surface boyish charm, explaining to  the viewers why Bundy's protestations of innocence were able to fool so  many people for so long, and also how he was able to lure his unsuspecting  victims to their ultimate fate.  Masters, Forrest, Walsh, and Ashton are  also excellent as the frustrated detectives who spent years following  Bundy's trail of death around the United States.  Thankfully, this movie  spares the viewers the grisly details of how the murders occurred, but the  non exploitive way in which it deals with Bundy's destruction of so many  lives is what truly makes this movie shine.  It runs for over three hours  and we all know what happened to Bundy in the end, but this fact is diluted  by the way the excellent script and acting weaves a web of suspense and  intrigue which is enthralling to the very end.  I can guarantee two things  - that whoever watches this mini series will never forget it, and they will  forever speculate as to the true tally of lives that Bundy took, a tally  which he carried with him to the grave.",961027200,12,1303,4.706666666666667

492046,4,6302662478,"Mark Harmon did an incredible job in this role. I'm a real fan of true crime and of course, who isn't fascinated by Ted Bundy? While I feel like this is a good movie and I'd definitely watch it again, it did bother me for several reasons. The biggest reason this movie bothered me is that I feel as if they changed the sequence of several events. I read Ann Rule's book: The Stranger Beside Me and this movie was based off of another author's book but I can't help but think that this would be a better movie if it was based off of Ann Rule's book.
  Also, I know I shouldn't really make fun of things that were the norm twenty-something years ago, but the music in this movie is just awful.",1496275200,,691,4.149253731343284
492047,5,6302662478,"I had not seen this movie for  many years, I just finished watching it. Though I know little about Mark Harmon's movies I would have to say this is probably his best role. He was so believable, great acting, and for those who have no real knowledge of sociopaths, after watching this, you will have seen a good movie, if you like forensic, as in Criminal Minds, then you will truly understand what this personality disorder is all about. It is explained very well and Ted met every criterion to be labeled this way.

The real Ted Bundy was was not handsome, like Mark, but in every other aspect, they were the same in their behavior toward unsuspecting young females. Many died at his hand and to satisfy his perverted appetite for violence beyond measure.

He got what he deserved, the electric chair. One wonders if anyone would object to this form of punishment for such a truly flawed individual.

If you like this type of movie, I would recommend this highly. I am very glad that I bought it.",1495065600,4,997,4.522222222222222

My only criticism is that it had no subtitles, which is hard for HOH or deaf to watch. I realize they didn't do closed captioning much back then, but still, I would have thought some form of CC or subtitles would have been included.  Its a very good movie; Mark Harmon was chilling as the handsome yet sub-human Ted Bundy.  Well worth the watch if you don't need assistance in hearing.",1491350400,,478,4.3

492243,4,6302662478,"This is a great movie, superbly acted across the board. So why only 4 stars, well having revisited this movie after first watching on tv in the late 1980's I found the first part of the movie somewhat hard to watch. The First half concentrates on Killer Ted Bundy's victims and how they met their deaths (although being on network tv it doesn't show the act itself, but is highly suggestive). Also when we first meet Bundy (Mark Harmon in an early Pre-NCIS role) he seems charming and seductive but also a control freak (Whose motivations come to the fore in the better 2nd half). His Girlfriend Cas Richter seems to appear as the generic oblivious partner in denial and doesn't get to do much except emote and look worried. Also there is a heavy focus on the detectives that are investigating the case (famous faces here include Blade Runner's M.Emmet Walsh & Beverly Hills Cop John Ashton). Unfortunately they are never explored in depth and some of these side characters get lost in the overall story in favour of the other investigators on the case. The film truly shines in the 2nd half when Bundy is caught and revealed to be the killer  and starts displaying the manipulative machinations and mind Games with the police and authorities. Although the film shies away from the victims confronting Bundy in court and doesn't cover the trial process, as it tries to condense everything despite the 3 hr runtime. Bundy very cleverly escapes custody and commits more shocking murders before being caught again. This Lorimar TV movie was made in 1986 when Bundy was still alive and on death row before his execution in 1989, so one must wonder if he ever saw it what he would thought of Harmon's performance. One of the things I find distracting about this movie is a lot of the actors have the same blue eyes as the lead, as it is something I found hard not to focus on, and it is hard to separate individual characters. Despite this being a DVD-R title that will only work in regular DVD players, I did find I was able to play it within my Cyberlink PowerDVD 8 on my laptop.",1471132800,,2076,4.565683646112601

Ted Bundy was a soul that clearly was damaged in so many ways that can't be explained. This is a perfect film that captures the story and the concept of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Truly a flawless acting performance by Mark Harmon. A brilliant performance that stays with you long after the ordeal. Mark is able to capture the disconnect concept of what is right and wrong. Bundy had a persona of emptiness and Mark was able to capture that persona to a flawless degree. I feel this movie is a must see forgotten piece of cinema. It needs a special edition blu-ray.

This movie focuses quite a bit on his personal life with his Cass (who is really Liz Kloepfer) and the things she goes through when all signs point to her Ted being ""the Ted"". It also goes over how police created a computer system so that other districts in other states can now communicate interconnectedly. Of course Mark Harmon is excellent in this role with his acting and good looks. Because it is older, the detail is not as good as now, but still a good watch.",1451347200,,768,4.267123287671233

492541,4,6302662478,"The true story of serial killer Ted Bundy, is told here in made for tv fashion, but it's still very chilling as this film gets almost all of it's details in line with the actual facts of the case.  Harmon is pretty well cast as Bundy, displaying an amazing amount of charm, and at the appropriate times menace.  The look on his face when he finds keys in a car he's about to steal after a jailbreak is startlingly real.  The actors who play the lead investigators are very good, and many viewers might recognize one of them as Taggart from Beverly Hills Cop.  The film seems to use mostly authentic locations as the real story mostly unfolded in 4 states, Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida.  If they cheated on much of that, they did a pretty convincing job of it.  Another thing that is very memorable is the electronic music score from Gil Melle.  I've seen his name on some other productions and he's clearly a pro.  The only thing that seemed way off for me here was the casting of 80s hottie, and solid actress Deborah Goodrich.  It's fairly obvious she's supposed to be Bundy's eventual real life wife, who looks nothing like her.  I enjoyed Goodrich's work, but the casting choice rings off.  There are other movies about Bundy, including one called Ted Bundy which is way gorier, and plays loose with some facts of the case, but that one is also worth catching for Michael Reilly Burke's performance in the lead.  I might almost say he outdid Harmon a little in that one, particularly in coming off creepier, but make no mistake Harmon is very good in this and I think Deliberate Stranger is overall the better of the two films.",1447027200,7,1642,4.5288135593220336

As others have said for it's time in the 80's when the film was made it was a violent story told in an innocent way if that makes sense.

Mark Harmon does such an incredible job of portraying Bundy, he is totally believable. What an incredible piece of acting on his part. It is too bad we cannot get a decent, up-to-date version of the Bundy story made, using the latest in video and audio technology. That being said, I don't know if another actor could play the role as well as Mark Harmon in this version. I can look at the man today, all these years later, with the gray hair and the laugh lines, and still see Ted Bundy in his eyes. His performance was that memorable.

So, yes, this is not HD and not Blu-ray, but if you can look past that, you will enjoy this biopic on the notorious serial killer. Definitely worth the price of the DVD. Thank goodness it is still available for purchase here on Amazon!",1439769600,,896,4.4969325153374236

492730,4,6302662478,"I've read many books about Ted Bundy, and I've perhaps watched every movie made about him as well, and I have to say that this just might be the most accurate portrayal of the ""mass murderer"" from the 70s and 80s.

And I use the phrase ""mass murderer"" because, at least from this movie, this is what they were called during that time frame.  Supposedly, Robert Ressler, the ex-FBI agent who was in the BSU unit with the now-famous John Douglas, was the first to coin the phrase ""serial killer,"" which is probably a more accurate moniker for these types of killers.  Of course, nowadays, ""mass murderers"" are defined as people who kill many people at one time; while ""serial killers"" are defined as people who kill many people, but over a period of time, with ""cooling off"" periods in-between.  Some people say ""two is enough,"" while others argue that ""three is necessary"" when it comes to the numbers killed to be classified as a ""serial killer,"" but really, both groups might just be splitting hairs.  At any rate, while I was watching this movie yesterday (2015-05-05), I noticed that it was exactly two years ago yesterday that Mr. Ressler passed away.

And it's been over 25 years now that Mr. Bundy passed away.  Of course, I'll just bet that many more people were upset by Mr. Ressler's passing than by Mr. Bundy's.  While the former was defining what a ""serial killer"" meant, the latter was demonstrating to the world what a ""serial killer"" could do.  And while this film doesn't show many of the gory details -- as others have already discussed on this site in their reviews -- this film does allude to enough.  And in this regards, it could be argued that this film doesn't glamorize the events, like other films have done.

And I think that this is a nice change of pace.  While watching, I really thought about all of the people that have profited from Mr. Bundy's murders, and that list is quite large.  I don't need to list those people here because you most likely already know their names.  But I liked the understatement of this film, and without reading the book, I believe that Richard Larsen didn't take advantage of these events as much as others have done.  If this is true, he truly deserves some kudos.  But this is only a guess, as I tried to add the book ""The Deliberate Stranger"" to my Wish List, but it is not yet available in Kindle format, and I rarely read books in paperback or hardcover format anymore.  I did request that the publishers would digitize it, however.  I'm crossing my fingers.

I do like Mark Harmon's portrayal of Mr. Bundy here; I think that the actor plays it well.  But I will admit that I wasn't completely fond of Frederick Forrest's interpretation of Dr. Robert Keppel, as I've seen the ex-Seattle detective on many interviews and the real-life version seems quite different from the acted version.  But ""The Riverman:  Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer"" by Mr. Keppel is one of the best books ever about serial murder, maybe even one of the best non-fiction books ever, regardless of genre.  It is outstanding, and I highly recommend it.

Well, to Mr. Ressler I say, ""May your soul rest in peace.""  To Mr. Bundy?  Well, just like the judge in Florida said while sentencing the killer, ""You went the wrong way, young man.""  But unlike that judge, I won't add, ""Take care of yourself,"" even post mortem, because you -- Ted Bundy -- didn't take care of anyone else.  At least in any good way.",1430870400,,3458,4.569805194805195

I've watched many documentaries as well as read a lot about him, so I noticed things in this movie that didn't really happen that way. Which doesn't make it a bad film, this happens with practically everything that is based on a true story. Especially when it involves a serial killer, people really look for that 'Scare' or 'Wow' factor in filming these movies. But all things considered this was well done and I liked it. They can always do better but they certainly could've done worse. I'd say it's probably one of the very best based on an actual serial killer movies I've seen. The Deliberate Stranger showed a lot more of the overall story I believe, instead of just showing the man behind closed doors you get more of the story with this film.",1424995200,,908,4.315789473684211

492920,5,6302662478,"I purchased my movie from Amazon.com LLC (comes in 2 discs). Mark Harmon's portrayal of Ted Bundy, a creepy but fascinating serial killer, is realistic and frightening. A charming and handsome man attending law school, Bundy must keep his real murderous self hidden. He just couldn't concentrate on his studies because he's exhausted from nights out hunting young female victims and must keep moving to different states to throw law enforcement off his trail. You are ""safe"" if he knows you -- he only kills ""strangers"" -- according to the movie anyway. Harmon gives a great performance of a self-centered, intelligent, weird, and quirky serial killer whose arrogance eventually does him in. To avoid execution, he desperately tries to bargain with those who want to see him die by doling out information on where to find the bodies of his missing victims. The movie leaves one to wonder if his ""other good persona"" -- is real -- and thus capable of any insight of the senselessness of it all - not only has he ruined his life, but is he sorry that he's caused such misery to so many people? The audible version is fascinating as well. I would say jt is equal to Ann Rule's story (on audible as well as print version) on Ted Bundy, ""The stranger beside me"". She actually knew Ted Bundy, and worked the phones with him alone at night at a crisis center hot line. The Craigslist killer reminds me of this story -- a brilliant doctor with a beautiful fianc can't help his urges to terrorize and kill women he meets through escort services.",1416528000,,1536,4.671586715867159

He was unstoppable in his quest. A complete loose cannon who was utterly brazen in his approach to murder. Seemingly unconcerned with the prospect of getting caught in the act he just could not resist the urge to kill, anytime or anywhere.  The original uncut version was as I have said, more graphic.

But, seeing the actor pull it off so well is only a compliment to his talent.  This film is one of many biopics about real-life serial killer Ted Bundy, who met his fate in Florida's electric chair in 1989 after having murdered thirty or more women.  Mr. Harmon plays the man as a suave, polite, charming, clean-cut young man who had the capability to lure his victims into his traps.  That was when his murderous rage set in and that was frightening to see from the charming man I had just described.  So another point for Mr. Harmon.  He plays Bundy just so that, despite all the man's ""positive"" attributes, we can never truly get on his side for we know him for the monster he truly is.  This is perhaps one of the best depictions of Ted Bundy, or any real-life serial killer for that matter, and we can only thank Mark Harmon for his hard work.

Mark Harmon portrays serial killer Bundy in a movie that's harrowing as only true-life crime sagas can be. Seattle reporter Richard W. Larsen's book Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger provides the basis for this startling portrait of an elusive killer, who was finally tried and executed in 1989.

LMN is doing a horrible job in every true life film from their own production unit. The 1980s and 1990s featured directors, writers and actors who were mature and well casted (not for ones looks) but for the accuracy in portraying films based on true stories and I can appreciate that. The emphasis on the films of 80s and 90s were taken very seriously and were well paced. The true stories today are very cheap looking, the casting is so very poor that they will choose anyone based on looks and being worried of which audience will watch a good film.

I truly and strongly suggest that they DO NOT re-make this one as it was well directed and well casted. The producers and directors do not have the same vision and quality of story telling as did in the 80s and 90s. This feature is LONG gone. I grew up as a young person in the 80s and as young people, we respected the adult themes and were not looking for gore as today's immature audience.

An absolutely perfect fit, in terms of a resemblance to Bundy, and Harmon's excellent acting ability.  It would be most difficult to call the film ""entertaining,"" because of simply the subject matter, but this a very believable film, and it is not ruined by gratuitous, graphic scenes, although the viewer has no difficulty mentally ""filling in the blanks"" regarding the horrific nature of Bundy's crimes against women.

493268,4,6302662478,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Mark Harmon's work over the years, but his portrayal of serial killer Ted Bundy remains one of my favorites.  To be honest the movie plays off more than a few of the myths surrounding Bundy and has been stripped of all but the most prominent elements from the investigation. It is based on the book by Richard Larsen (rather than the more interesting and richer Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule).  Most of the names have been changed and the character development is weak, so if you are looking for a biopic you won't find it here.  That said, Harmon is positively captivating for his ability to shift between smooth talking law student and sociopath.  There have been only a couple of serial killers akin to Bundy (most notably Rodney Alcala), but I think Mark Harmon captures the essence of the horrific Bundy mystique.",1352937600,2,845,4.6891891891891895
493309,5,6302662478,"One of the best mini-series ever made. No, it's not 'Roots' or 'Centennial', but Mark Harmon is so good as the ""seemingly-normal"" boy-next-door Ted Bundy (who was possibly even more murderous than the Green River Killer. Teddy Boy took many unsolved murders to the grave with him). If this was made in 1986 (it was), then it was 1996 before I could watch Harmon in any other role without getting squeamish.

About this movie's 'non-graphic' horror & gore aspect - about which so many other reviewers are apparently disappointed - two things must be taken into account: 1) this was a 1986 made-for-TV movie; and 2) those reviewers are likely expecting this nearly 30-year-old film to have the mega-violent, in-your-face gore so prevelent in more recent movies.

The movie is paced very well and stays very close to the facts, including the actual locales of so many of the crimes.

I bet two things, if you have not seen this movie before: 1) you'll watch it more-than-once within the 1st year you own it, and 2) you'll loan it or recommend it to others.

493310,4,6302662478,"There have been a few movies made about Bundy.  Some have been riddled with errors and it makes me wonder if the filmmaker is even familiar with the story.  This made for TV movie is based on the book of the same name and generally presents the facts as they are known.  Harmon is pretty well cast as Bundy.  He looks somewhat like him and sounds a bit like him as well.  The real Ted was more of an awkward, geeky type and less of the All-American person portrayed here but then that was the the way the media was presenting him back then.  All in all this is a faithful telling of the Ted Bundy story in as much as can be told in a TV miniseries.  Since it's a TV movie the more horrifying aspects of Ted's crimes are omitted. I recommend reading the book if one is interested in finding out what a deviant personality this guy really was. 4 stars, maybe even 4.5.  As far as TV miniseries go it's one of the better ones.",1344297600,,923,4.11731843575419

Being made-for-TV and being made in 1986, I knew it wouldn't be very graphic which was fine by me. I also noticed that many of the victims' names were changed. I'm a stickler for details so I don't understand the reasoning behind this (I know the families have to give the OK for the victims' real names to be used) but you can easily find the victims' real names on the internet.

The violence is only hinted at and the murder scenes are done in darkness but create quite an impact.

It seems like the movie might've been intended to be a longer mini-series, but had to be edited down. Even tho that is noticeable it's not a problem  - because the casting is excellent and the acting, by all, but especially by Harmon and Forrest, is top notch. I've watched this movie a few times already and each time i pick up something i didn't before. A couple of very violent scenes make a point but the movie does not focus on that aspect too much. It's more an attempt at a psychological study. The movie doesn't quite solve ""why"" Bundy did what he did but they speculate it could range from him finding out he was born a bastard to the possibility he was a sociopath or evil or some combination of factors. But it did show that Bundy didn't seem to be afraid of anything. The case for ""sociopath"" was convincing IMO.

In addition the move is believable and the dialogue is very real and natural. And it's very educational without any feeling that the producers had any bias. Altho, wrt the bias, the book in which the movie is based on was written by a friend of Bundy's who believed for awhile that he was innocent but later did not.",1303516800,2,1234,4.360869565217391

It got a bit boring watching the police scratch their heads in every other scene.

The thing that makes it great is not, as most critics say, Harmon playing against his looks. Bundy in real life was a good-looking man. Harmon nails the cold lack of emotion and multi-layered persona of the killer making you feel that at any time he might explode. Harmon's Bundy is always charming but there is always something just a little wrong with everything he does.

If you see Harmon in his current show NCIS you will wonder if the same man played both parts. Harmon is an even better actor now than he was then and that's saying something.

Another review complains that this film is sanitized but its plenty violent. It's just not bloody and over the top. It's just frightening enough.

It is an interesting reenactment of the Ted Bundy murder spree. Many incidents are only hinted at for their horrifying details. Unless you know the case, other than the numbers, which even then this only hints at you will not get any where near the whole horror.

The film only hints at Ted Bundy's involvement, there is some doubt for a time if it was coincidence.
I do not enjoy seeing gore and graphic violence, but other than some blood spatter on pictures at the end; the movie is so very sanitized that even the last murders at the sorority house and the killing of a 12 year old girl only show a small extent of the violence of Bundy's physical attacks.

Mark Harmon does a good job, in that he portrays this man who had all of his acquaintances fooled until the very end. His innocent sweet, next door neighbor looks do not lend any menace at all; but maybe that was what made Bundy so successful in his ability to pick up these girls. There is very little motive given either for this huge killing spree.
Where the movie shines is in Bundy's relationship with the law enforcement officials as they closed in on him as a suspect and how he could escape not once but twice.

In this day-and-age, it's nice to see a movie in which the cops are portrayed as tough but fair and likable. In this case, the two main ones are played by Frederick Forest (""Apocalypse Now"") and John Ashton (""Midnight Run""). Since it was made for television in the 1980s, the movie has little profanity and blood.

 Most of the time, the violence is implied. It's still chilling in parts. We don't always need CSI-type blood and guts to get the point.

What they missed, however, was WHY Bundy did the things he did. They had time to develop that angle, but never touched it. Supposedly, violent pornography had something to do with his behavior, but nothing was explored in this film. Otherwise,I would give this five stars.

Overall, it was still an interesting story and amazing how many people he fooled and how he could escape twice after being arrested. Good story.",1233878400,,1138,4.698492462311558
493475,4,6302662478,"PLOT: Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy~ he nailed this performance~ excellent portait of Ted the man with charm and looks enough to fool JUST about everyone~ very good detailed.

Ted Bundy was charming and was  headed to law school. He loved women and women loved him~ his charm, wit, very empathetic and most of all handsome looks made him stand out~ but his superior IQ all gave him the means to vent his Psychopathic personality and be very successful at serial killing. The actual number is still (some believe over 100 in 6 or more states)... BUT in ""this"" version about 20 girls over many years (1974-1978) were  succesfully killed by TED~ why his own friends believe him innocent~ Ted has the charm to have girl friends and be fairly nice to them~ they fall in love with his charm and looks~ but some where the REAL Ted show up and then he sets off on a killing spree~the term THE DELIBERATE STRANGER IS BECAUSE TED ALWAYS ""CHOOSE STRANGERS"" TO MURDER~ but has lasting relationships with his friends and girlfrieds.....but TED sees his target and in broad day at beaches, ski resorts, school, college campuses and more... TED in plain sight knows how to ""charm"" and TRICK the women to go with him by any lie he can ...just  long ""enough for TED to abduct and kill them""~ and then next thing a girl is missing~  with some computer work and plain old fashion good detective work TED hit the top of the suspect list~ at the times the police can blame their own blunders when he escapes more than once the last time sadly he killed and raped many women in several days~ before one last capture~ ODDLY ENOUOGH what leads the police most of the time for his ""captures"" is his lousy driving he stopped and then gets arrested. GEE doesn't every one have a PAIR OF HANDCUFFS AND CROWBAR IN THE BACK OF THE CAR~? before DNA this is a good movie and clever Ted cons just about every one~ MARK HARMON IS EXCELLENT right down the charm and good looks and has women falling all over him~ he ""becomes TED"".

I GIVE THIS A SOLID 9 OUT OF 10 FOR A VERY GOOD TV MOVIE.",1210204800,2,2049,4.3931398416886545
493476,5,6302662478,"Mark Harmon proved to the world that besides good looks that he can act with this mini-series. He is ferocious as Ted Bundy, all smiles and glad handing, eager to help and be liked, handsom,smart, and the most depraved, sick,""monster"" who every walked the Earth. Mr. Harmon gives you all that in just one lopsided grin,turn of his head, or in just a stare that chills your blood as he hunts women with a most casual air about him.
  As to the person who complained about the name changes of the victims, that was done because at the time the film was made may of the cases were still in court and they didn't want to spoil and new charges that might be brought. They also did this at the behest of many of the families.
  Other than that they get the facts right and do the best they can to tell the story right(it would have been impossible to cover EVERY MURDER in the running time they had. this is the most complete film I have ever seen on Mr. Bundy and Mark Harmon is stunning and even manages to make you feel sorry for him sometimes just like the real Bundy did.
  A very fine job by all involved",1185840000,2,1104,4.208530805687204
493477,1,6302662478,"I have seen this movie and Mark Harmon is excellent.  However, I did not purchase this film as I thought the sellers carrying it made it too pricey.",1176422400,2,148,4.285714285714286
493478,4,6302662478,"I would say this television movie is a must see for anyone interested in the life and ""career"" of serial killer Ted Bundy.  Mark Harmon does a very respectable job of portraying a man who is charming, intellectual, romantic, charismatic, intellectual, and digustingly despicable, all at the same time.

You must keep in mind that this movie was made in 1986, and for television.  Because of that, it does not display the violence of Bundy's story the way movies today (in the 21st century) are likely to portray violence.  Still, the graphic violence really isn't needed in this case.  Bundy's story is really a tale of a life full of potential gone incredibly wrong.  ""The Deliberate Stranger"" captures that theme very well, and Harmon portrays Bundy with a personality (and sickness) that has you glued to the screen.

In terms of accuracy, I would say this TV movie is 95% right on.  It is perfectly understandable that the names of the victims were changed (for the most part), but the circumstances of their crimes were not.  I would recommend reading Larsen's book of the same name or Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me"" before viewing the movie.  Trust me, you will be able to relate all the ficitious names in the movie to the real life victims and circumstances.  Some of the scenes are so close to the real facts that it is chilling.

There have been several movies about Bundy in the years since ""The Deliberate Stranger"" was produced in 1986.  I would still recommend this one above all the others.  Again, you need to keep in mind that it was made for television and the year in which it was made, but even still, it is a compelling portrayal of the events as they unfolded.  If you are simply looking for blood and guts, this is not the version for you, but if you are looking for a multidimensional look at the man -- Theodore Robert Bundy -- you will be quite happy with this version and with Harmon's portrayal.

Keep in mind that this movie was made within a decade of the actual events.  So far, it is as close to the real life facts as I've ever seen in a dramatic presentation of Bundy's life.  I'm still hoping for a *quality* feature film on Ted Bundy.  If done right, and with the proper budget (and talented actors), I think that type of film could be an Oscar winner.  Until then, Mark Harmon's television Bundy stands up quite well.  Get it.  Watch it.  This fascinating, compelling, and tragic tale of wasted potential and lives ended too soon never goes out of style.  You will be riveted.  Its one major shortcoming is that is was filmed (and completed) three years before Bundy's real life tale finally came to an end -- in the electric chair at Florida State Prison.  If only there could be an *afterward* to television movies.",1156723200,15,2759,4.5682281059063135
493479,4,6302662478,"I remember seeing this movie on TV when I was a kid, and from that, I became obsessed with serial killers. Not in a bad way...I've just found them fascinating, that they can appear so seemingly ordinary yet they're completely crazy. And we're not just talking a few sandwiches short of a picnic here either. Anyway, if you know about Ted Bundy, you will certainly enjoy this movie, despite some discrepencies in accuracy. I wish they would put this on DVD already! So, if you have ever been interested in Ted Bundy, The Deliberate Stranger will certainly appeal to you.",1154563200,6,569,4.7
