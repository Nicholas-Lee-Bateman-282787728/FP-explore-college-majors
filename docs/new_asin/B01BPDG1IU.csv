7665056,3,B01BPDG1IU,"Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda is not the filmmaker to turn to if you're looking for explosive action or larger-than-life characters. His stories are simple, gentle, and human, with emotions more powerful than a million Roland Emmerich disaster flicks. But don't mistake the elegance of his filmmaking with a lack of edge. Films such as Nobody Knows and his Cannes Award-winner Like Father Like Son posed nearly impossible familial dilemmas, the kind that leaves the mind racing with difficult solutions. Koreeda's latest, Our Little Sister, is closer to the fairy tale tone of his nearly-flawless childhood adventure, I Wish, although this exploration of family obligation and loss is less challenging than his prior output.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you; it's just that Koreeda's exemplary body of work demands constant comparison. There are no shortage of affecting, sublime moments of personal growth and sisterly bonding in Koreeda's adaptation of Akimi Yashida's popular manga series, as well as many revealing glimpses into Japanese culture. It's in those seemingly inconsequential details, the everyday minutia of everyday life in Japan that Koreeda commits to showing, that we manage to fall in love with these characters.

It almost sounds like the setup for an American dramatic series on the CW. The film centers on three grown-up sisters living together under one roof, all fitting into specific Japanese archetypes. There's sensible eldest sister Sachi (Haruka Ayase), who often finds herself at odds with hard-drinking middle sister Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa). Filling the appropriate amount of quirk is youngest sister Chika (Kaho), whose awkward social graces, especially at the dinner table, are an occasional source of conflict. They have no parents, at least none living in their home, and romantic entanglements only a peripheral concern. All seems content, maybe not perfect but comfortable, until their estranged father passes away and they are forced to attend his funeral. It's there they learn of their half-sister, Suzu (Hirose Suzu), a reserved and mature 15-year-old now left without the one parent she felt a connection with. The sisters invite her to live with them, instead, and hilarity ensues.

Not so much, or at least you aren't going to find big laughs in Our Little Sister. That said, Koreeda is going for a lighter, breezier feel this time, but it's humor built from the sisters' numerous eccentricities and tight bond. They always seem to be indulging in a meal or planning the next one, which makes sense because family meals remain an important fixture in Japanese culture. But there isn't a ton of conflict, at least not within the sisters themselves. There's little tension that arises due to Suzu's guilt over her mother, who was the mistress that broke up the family. Sachi harbors a lot of resentment towards her father for what he did, but it's contradicted by the long-running relationship she has with a married physician. There are other such elements that converge to create a loving tapestry of sisterhood, without any of them emerging as a dominant narrative. Suzu quickly fits in at her new school, becoming a star soccer player; the girls harvest plums for the family wine; Sachi becomes a terminal care nurse; Yoshino deals with adult responsibilities; and Chika longs for an eccentric co-worker. These things bring the sisters together and never is there the suggestion (or no believable suggestion) any of it will tear them apart, which keeps the stakes low throughout.

Like many of Koreeda's other films, Our Little Sister is a gradual reflection of rustic Japan, away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. Think a live-action Miyazaki anime and you'll get the idea. It's perfect for the casual pace Koreeda prefers, and he carries us, totally at his own time, through each tender and stress-free scene. He's content to serve up a meal of genuine yet familiar human emotion, leaving us unsatisfied and eager for the next helping.",1480723200,2,4015,5.172307692307692

Rating = ***
Director:  Hirokazu Koreeda
Producers:  Takashi Ishihara et al.
DVD
2015

Film = three (3) stars; subtitles/translations = five (5) stars; cinematography = four (4) stars; music = 3.5 stars.  Director Hirokazu Koreeda's feel-good Kamakura tale of three long-abandoned sisters (their father left 15 years ago, their mother moved to Hokkaido and last visited 14 years ago) living in their deceased grandmother's house unexpectedly discovering a much younger paternal half sister at their father's funeral.  Since the three sisters have pretty much had to learn to raise themselves (under the watchful eye of a great aunt?), they feel qualified to raise the de facto foundling. Koreeda is credited as being a screen writer and the editor.  The Director under delivers on plot possibilities.  Engaging emotional highs and lows are mostly among the missing. The scenario seems tinged with an aura of artificiality (it appears to lack, well, a real ""sisters' touch"").  Actress Suzu Hirose plays the ""little"" sister. While her performance is very good, she appears to be too old to play a coming-of-age teenager (the other three lead actress also seem a bit too old for their roles).  Editing leaves some rough edges especially when intended scene sequences are abruptly terminated.  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) and lighting are excellent except for an overexposed, inconsequential exterior scene that should have been reshot or cut.  Score is fine.  Sound fields are okay.  Subtitles and translations are outstanding.  Dialog subtitles are close to being spot on.  Writing and signs are translated.  All closing credits are also translated--a rarity in Japanese films.  Congratulations to the producers!  An above average chick flick.  Recommended.

7665060,5,B01BPDG1IU,"Having lived in Japan for decades, this hits home so much. Even if you haven't lived there, it's still a wondrous joy to watch. It pretty much captures what daily life is like for Japanese women without being condescending or falling into some stereotyping. There's a lot of depth of emotion in Japan but it's all bubbling under the surface. The other beauty of the movie is the cinematography. The ability to capture the feeling of such truly Japanese seasonal things as viewing cherry blossoms in spring or watching the city's fireworks festivals and feeling as if you are there is a true cinematic skill.
The wrapping of the whole sisterhood around funerals was also a very very Japanese way of looking at the cycles of life and how so many Japanese live simply and well...and how others in that nation are as messed up as any humans anywhere.

The subtitled translations are also excellent for the most part trying to capture the nuance rather than a word-by-word translation.

There are zero extras on the DVD though but even so it's such a good movie, it's worth renting online at the very least.",1509148800,,1102,4.704663212435233

7665065,5,B01BPDG1IU,"Sachi, Yoshino and Chika are sisters who live in a big, old family home.  Their father left years ago, running off with another woman.  Their emotionally immature mother also left, leaving Sachi as the ""den mother"" in the house.  When they hear their father has died, the three young women go to his funeral where they meet their teenaged half-sister Suzu.  Suzu's mother is gone and her emotionally immature step-mother is left to raise her.  Sachi sees herself in the young girl and invites her to come live with them.  Thus, three sisters become four, and the story explores how they relate to each other and male friends; as well as how they deal with having absent parents, who weren't the best examples of how to be responsible adults. It's a beautifully filmed, slow-moving story and a wonderful tribute to sisterhood.",1499040000,,825,4.815602836879433

7665071,5,B01BPDG1IU,"Hiro Kore'eda started in docs, made his mark, and thus could go on to make his own feature films.  He says himself that he echoes the director Naruse, more than the master director Ozu; but this film is set in Kamakura, the city itself almost a character in two of Ozu's great movies (Late Spring and Early Summer); and this Kore'eda movie, like so much of Ozu's work, is a perfect family portrait.  So far for me it's Kore'eda's masterpiece - lightly handled, always positive, by genre a comedy in the classic sense, yet it opens with a funeral (with quotes from Ozu) and closes with a second funeral; and yet we are never sad, just deeply moved by the way the characters are, each, in the final instance, so generous & positive.

A younger orphaned half-sister is invited by her siblings to come & live with them in Kamakura.  She does so, and the film grows from there.",1492473600,2,872,4.465408805031447
7665072,5,B01BPDG1IU,"The story is set in a small household shared by three sisters with distinctly different personalities. 29-year-old Sachi Kouda (Haruka Ayase) is restrained and mature; 22-year-old Yoshino Kouda (Masami Nagasawa) is outgoing but has a tendency to fall for unsuitable boys; and 19-year-old Chika Kouda (Kaho) is quirky and childlike. While attending the funeral of their estranged father, they met 14-year-old Suzu Asano (Suzu Hirose), the daughter of their father by another woman. In an uncharacteristically impulsive move, Sachi, the oldest sister, invited Suzu to come and live with them. Through Suzu, the three sisters came to discover a part of their father they never knew. As the four sisters forged new bonds, they also struggled with their own feelings for their absent mother and their father's infidelity.

This classic Japanese family drama is slow paced. The camera lingers on breathtaking countrysides and hillsides, on charming, sisterly chatters and banters, and on isolated train stations that marked the turning points in the sisters' relationships. When the outburst and meltdown did come, they were well-timed and touching. If you like Hollywood films with larger-than-life personalities and wild emotions, this may not be your kind of movie. But if you like films that let you get to know the characters and experience their quiet dignity, the four sisters here will stay with your for a long time.",1491091200,8,1419,5.306666666666667

All are unmarried; two are in relationships with men who treat them well but indifferently.

They go to his funeral and learn that their father had a daughter, now 15 years old, with this woman.  On an impulse they invite the girl to come and live with them.  The movie is about a year in the life they have together.  No American film maker would make a film so lacking in dramatic incident.  On the other hand no American film maker is a genius like Kore-eda in unraveling the kindness, the humor, the fellow feeling that these three women have for their newly found step-sister, and in turn her sweetness and growing into a new community in her life.  The word ""quotidian"" fits this film perfectly---the everyday, the commonplace.  And in his hands, genius.",1484092800,20,1037,4.711111111111111

8750982,5,B01BPDG1IU,"It's been a very long time since I've seen a masterful Japanese film, and this one qualifies without reservation, on so many grounds.

I've never been to Japan, and much less understand the Japanese archetypes of which another reviewer speaks.

But the four sisters in this film---eldest Sachi (Haruka Ayase), Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa), youngest Chika (Kaho) and their newly discovered little sister Suzu (Hirose Suzu)---fit one another like a kid glove fits the most delicate hands, notwithstanding the horrible family dysfunctions that have affected each of them in different ways.

I am blessed with two sisters, and while no one will ever make a film about us, we have certainly shuffled through our share of family dysfunctions, and have always come out with pure love for one another.

This film is pure love, and I truly pity every child, parent and sibling who has ever become estranged from one another for whatever reason. Life is too short not to enjoy the gifts that one is given, and family, in this case, sisters, are the certainly one of the most significant gifts life has to offer.

This film captures myriad Japanese mannerisms and characteristics that one recognizes as unique to Japan. At the same time, however, it speaks in a universal language that all people everywhere can understand.

I can't recommend this gorgeous film highly enough.",1532476800,,1362,5.0311111111111115

8750986,5,B01BPDG1IU,"Our Little Sister:  A Masterpiece
(My review first appeared in Huffington Press when the film was released)

Our Little Sister is a film of surpassing beauty and sensitivity, a fully realized insight into family, a simple story of three sisters living together who are joined by their half sister. It unfolds patiently, with elegance and understanding.

The three Koda sisters  Sachi, Yoshino and Chika  live together in Kamakura by the sea. Years earlier they were abandoned to live in their grandmothers house. First their father left their mother for another woman. Then their mother ran off with another man. 30-year-old Sachi (Haruka Ayase), a nurse at a nearby hospital, kept the family together, raising the younger sisters.

When the sisters hear of their fathers death, they decide to put aside old feelings of abandonment to travel to his funeral. At the memorial service, they encounter Suzu Asano (Suzu Hirose), their fathers child with his third wife. Their meeting is at first uncomfortable. Feelings about the father are unresolved. But the open kindness of young Suzu disarms skepticism.

Sachi spontaneously invites Suzu to come live with them. Suzu gratefully accepts. She fits in quickly and well. Clearly, she is mature beyond her 13 years, having nursed her declining father. Suzu is helpful and upbeat. She adapts to school and community, as well. Skillful in soccer and proficient in studies, she wins friends, including one particularly interested boy. She enjoys hanging out with classmates at the local diner.

There are bumps in the road. But they are slight. The fact that Suzu looks like her mother, the woman who lured their father away, gives the sisters pause. As their grandmother warns, Shes the daughter of the woman who destroyed your family.

Through her quiet, supportive presence, Suzu provides a foil for the other sisters character development. Chika (Kaho) and her boyfriend who has lost six toes on Mt. Everest are always upbeat. Sachis secret affair with a married doctor at her hospital is more problematic. Yoshinos (Masami Nagasawa) serial failed romances and flightiness give even less promise for her future.

But the four sisters grow together. Normal family occasions, maintenance, tasks and issues rise and are resolved or dispatched. Suzu is woven into the fabric of their daily lives, complementing her siblings, even filling in spaces in their knowledge and memories. She shares reminiscences of their father that help the other sisters better understand their father and themselves. By films end, they are bound by family and friendship, commonalities and differences. They are a family of four women learning from their experience to build a better life together.

The story is presented through the sparse, but knowing dialogue of writer Akimi Yoshida and director Kore-eda Hirokazu adapted from Yoshidas graphic novel Umimachi Diary. It is exquisitely framed by Kore-edas breathtaking tracking shots of the sisters at the railway station, at their house window and at films conclusion against the Kamakura seashore.

Our Little Sister won nine Japanese Academy Awards, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Film.

Although it may be heresy, one cannot view Our Little Sister and other work by Kore-eda (Still Walking, Like Father, Like Son, After Life) without thinking of the towering postwar achievements of Tokyo Story Director Yasujiro Ozu (Late Spring, Early Summer, An Autumn Afternoon). There is no higher compliment.",1517529600,2,3490,5.277978339350181
