6263677,4,B00IGVJH0E,"This series was very good, but not as good as the 1990s animated spiderman series which was truly spectacular. (Unfortunately that series has not been competely released on DVD.)",1395532800,,178,5.172413793103448
6263678,5,B00IGVJH0E,This cartoon is so good words can't express how good this cartoon is Great story and excellent. People doing the voice for spidey and other people and the action is non stop I really wish this stayed on longer there were so much they could have done.,1395446400,11,250,4.340425531914893
6263679,5,B00IGVJH0E,Quite simply one of the best superhero shows of all time (just behind Batman: The Animated Series) and who knows where it would have ranked if it weren't canceled so early.  I've been waiting for this release for 5 years now.  So happy it's finally being released in its entirety.,1394668800,12,280,4.58
6263680,5,B00IGVJH0E,"I love this series - it has great character development and fantastic action. It's s fresh take on the character while remaining true to the spirit of the classic comic. For my experience, this is the best version of Spider-Man in any movie or tv show.",1393891200,14,252,4.5
6263681,4,B00IGVJH0E,"Loved this series, wish it had lasted longer, it was by far the most authentic version of SPIDER-MAN I'd ever seen. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 is because, well, how can I put this delicately? ""Hey SONY, how about distributing a COMPLETE SERIES, for those of us who ""Don't"" have a BLU-RAY?""",1393459200,4,309,4.344827586206897
6263682,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Best Spider-Man series ever made.  No other way to say but that.  I never thought a full series set would see the light of day because of rights issues, but thankfully it's coming.  Makes the fact that the show got canned in the first place a little easier to swallow.  Now all we need is an Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes full series blu-ray box set (and Young Justice & Green Lantern on DC's side) and all will be right with the world.",1393372800,8,441,4.341463414634147
6263683,4,B00IGVJH0E,"I adored this show when it was in air and the fact it was cancelled still hurts.

Season 2 has only been available as individual volumes which were not released here and to buy them separately online was a rather costly affair. So I always avoided buying them and now, with this package, I can watch the whole show in glorious HD.

Bummed there aren't any new features or commentaries accompanying this release, but I'll take what I can get.",1393286400,39,441,4.5
6263684,5,B00IGVJH0E,"This is without a doubt, the greatest Spider-Man incarnation of all time. In either film or television. It stays true to it's source material and provides spectacular story-telling and characters. The blu-ray announcement came out of nowhere and has me so excited. I cannot wait for this release! Day one buy and highly, highly recommended.",1393200000,35,340,5.2
6263685,5,B00IGVJH0E,Its a good show & wish they could've actually ended the series. I can't wait for Ultimate Spider-Man to come out on Blu-ray :D,1393200000,3,126,4.291666666666667

6263689,5,B00IGVJH0E,This is an awesome cartoon TV series and I recommend it to those who like Spider-Man. The only thing that stinks is that the series itself was cancelled.,1502668800,,153,4.5
6263690,5,B00IGVJH0E,Great series that ended too soon. Excellent voice cast.,1496707200,2,55,5.222222222222222
6263691,5,B00IGVJH0E,This series is spectacular.  It looks over the whole history of spider-man and blends it perfectly together.  Plus I love the theme song.  It was cancelled far too soon.,1494547200,,169,4.758620689655173
6263692,5,B00IGVJH0E,"There are few cartoons that hit just the right sweet spot of being acceptable for kids to watch, but also being witty and entertaining for adults. this game isn't a gem, nor a goldmine, it is the flawless diamond of cartoons. I do not say this lightly while considering other amazing shows such as Invader Zim, Kim Possible, Powerpuff Girls, Animaniacs, and so fourth. No other cartoon brings fourth such a believable cast, honest highschool drama, witty humor, convincing villains, and great action. In fact, no other show comes close to accomplishing what this one did in just two seasons. Every villain has a backstory and a setup, and every fight some sweet moves.

Considering the entirety of the show there are only two problems that one can come up with. The first, obviously, being how we were cut so short thanks to Disney buying Marvel. The second is a small plot hole they created themselves thanks to a single line of sloppy writing early on (which I can easily forgive) So if you want to watch some great cartoon, give this one a try. I promise within 24 hours you will find yourself humming the themesong.",1491350400,9,1119,4.680203045685279

6263695,2,B00IGVJH0E,The series is great but I was expecting it to come in the normal slip the DVD should come in which I have seen come with many other people's so obviously it was originally there and the seller must have removed it before sending it to me so that is missing and I do feel like I am getting kind of cheated because of it but everything else are in satisfactory condition but do consider it a big deal if things are left out so I'm not very happy,1485820800,,443,3.9887640449438204

6263706,5,B00IGVJH0E,"When I first saw one of my roommates watching this a few years ago on Netflix (why did you take it down?), I was tempted to make fun of him. Surely this couldn't be that great. Surely it couldn't compare to the old series. But when I sat down to watch it myself, I couldn't have been more impressed. I'm yet to see any film adaptation surpass what this series did with the character while staying true to the comic roots. This is leaps and bounds ahead of the old Spider-Man series. I'm not sure how to compare it to Ultimate Spider-Man because it has become so crazy its about beyond my realm of understanding. But IMHO, there is no better adaptation of Spidey than this. Can't wait to introduce my kids to it.",1473724800,,711,4.313432835820896

6263711,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Except for Stan Lee and John Romita's Spider-man run in Marvel Comics back in the 60s, this is my favorite Spidey rendition ever. Solid stories and great looking animation. This is Spider-man's version of Batman: The Animated Series IMO. This IS spectacular!",1468540800,6,258,5.166666666666667
6263712,5,B00IGVJH0E,Are you a 90s kid ? Did you watch Batman the animated series and loved it?? Did you wake up Saturday mornings to watch XMen the Animated series and loved it ? Well then I highly suggest you watch this show!!! It's just as good and probably even better than the cartoons I just mentioned and I grew up on those shows. Oooo did and did I mention the theme song is catchy as hell.,1467504000,,377,4.04
6263713,5,B00IGVJH0E,"In my personal opinion, The Spectacular Spider-Man is the best Spidey series ever. From the opening theme to their spot on adaptation of Peter Parker this is without a doubt a must watch series.",1466640000,,194,4.735294117647059

 for a fun and movie like experience.",1464048000,,294,4.88
6263718,5,B00IGVJH0E,This was my early childhood and one if the best adaptations if Spider-man ever. I recommend not only for kids but adults that are fans of marvel\spidey too.,1463356800,,156,4.607142857142857
6263719,5,B00IGVJH0E,"The series itself is great, I highly recommend it to any Spider-Man fan. As far as the item goes, it includes both seasons of the show in good quality.",1462320000,,151,4.241379310344827
6263720,5,B00IGVJH0E,Easily the best animated adaptation of the Marvel's web-slinging hero ever made. It's a real shame it got cancelled ahead of its time.,1462147200,,134,4.869565217391305
6263721,5,B00IGVJH0E,Best animated Spiderman series by a mile.  Don't let the art style fool you the characters have depth and it does a great job developing some great story arcs.  Great too watch with younger and older kids alike.,1460678400,,211,4.526315789473684
6263722,5,B00IGVJH0E,"What more can I say in addition to reviews already given? I absolutely loved every minute of it. I'm giving it five stars for picture quality,  audio quality and storytelling. I enjoyed this animated film far more than I did the Spiderman movies",1460246400,,245,4.6976744186046515
6263723,5,B00IGVJH0E,"The best portrayal of Spider-Man/Peter Parker and other characters from the series. I remember watching this show when I was younger, along with Spider-Man TAS. It offers so much for the fans. It gets the characters right, has good animation and clever references. I will also mention the fantastic humor and the entertaining action. This is the cartoon series that deserves praise for being so darn good. It's just a shame that it got cancelled for the god awful show known as Ultimate Spider-Man. Well, it was great while it lasted, for only two seasons. I do recommend that every Spider-Man fan should get this for their collection and watch the Spectacular Spider-Man series. You won't regret it!",1459382400,,700,4.940677966101695
6263724,4,B00IGVJH0E,"Great quality show that tackles all the main concepts of what makes Spider-Man. When it comes from his romance, his emotional conflicts between family and school, and balancing his duties with his hero work with being there for the people he cares, it's no wonder why people love this hem so much. Such a shame how this show gets overlooked by many, due to its artistic joice on design.

I only wish there was bit more content in the special features. While there was the behind-the-scenes content, I expected a bit more available beyond that. Leave it as it may, if you love Spider-Man, than this is one of, if not, the best adaptation of the original comics in cartoon format at least that would hope become more and more of a a classic as years to come",1458518400,,755,4.471014492753623
6263725,5,B00IGVJH0E,"What a great series....Spiderman and his friends really shine in this one.  However I would like to know from others are their disc 3 able to play special features. Supposedly there are 3 of them...Spider-man Reanimated, Stylizing Spidey and The Spectacular Spiderman Music Video. When I press play on my remote control a boxed menu appears in the middle of the screen that says Please Insert Disc 2. When I do there are no options for special features on disc 2 at all. Can someone shed the light on this please?",1458432000,,513,4.637362637362638
6263726,1,B00IGVJH0E,My 4 yr old son loves Spider-Man.  It was so disappointing when I found out 1 of the 4 discs were missing.  Returned it and now looking for something else now.,1457740800,,159,4.096774193548387
6263727,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Probably the best Spider-Man series ever. Once you get past the very stylized look (which you either love or hate) then you're in for a fantastic series that may even top the much loved 90's show.

Of course, the bittersweet aspect of this is that there are only two seasons. The even bigger tragedy is that while this series was short-lived, the worst animated Spider-Man series EVER, 'Ultimate Spider-Man', continues onto it's fourth, mind-numbingly dumbed downed for small children run. In fact, it's more like a junior Agents of Shield show than anything to do with Spidey himself, he just happens to be wearing the suit.

So if you want a true Spider-Man show, this is the one to get.",1456617600,,689,4.733333333333333
6263728,5,B00IGVJH0E,Me and my daughter love it. The last of the great spiderman cartoons.,1456531200,,69,4.384615384615385
6263729,5,B00IGVJH0E,Wish they make another season.,1456444800,,30,5.2
6263730,5,B00IGVJH0E,I love this series.  I first watched it on Disney XD in 2009 when it premiered there.  Over the years I had forgotten what the episodes and series included but remembered loving it back then so one day I decided to look it up again and once I got the name again I looked it up on Amazon.  I was delighted to find that the series was on Blue Ray and ordered it the minute I got the chance to.  As I watched it all the episodes and what happened in them came back to me and I fell in love with the series all over again.  I just finished re watching it tonight.  I have to say I love it just as much as I did when I watched it the first time on TV all those years ago and the fact its on Blue Ray makes it even better.  The picture and  sound is amazing.  My only complaint about the Blue Ray is that each disk lists all the episodes from the season and doesn't just list the episodes on the disk so it made things confusing at first.  Also when you select an episode not on the current disk your watching it says insert either disk 1 or disk 2.  It doesn't go by disks 1 through 4.  However the disks are properly labeled with the numbers 1 through 4 so that doesn't make it a huge issue if you know the disk your currently on.  I also wish this came with more special features but oh well I'll take what I can get.  I'm just glad the whole series was released and now I can enjoy it forever.  It was great re watching the series because it almost felt like I was watching it for the first time because I hadn't seen it in years and forgot most of what happened until seeing it again.  I hated that it ended on a cliff hanger though just like I did back then when I watched it years ago. Too bad it was canceled.  I always thought it deserved more seasons.  Despite the cliff hanger I still love it though and I'm very glad I own it.,1454544000,,1832,3.9186991869918697
6263731,5,B00IGVJH0E,One of my all-time favorite Spiderman series. Animation and writing are great.,1453334400,,78,5.583333333333333
6263732,5,B00IGVJH0E,"This is, simply put, the best animated Spiderman series ever produced (and I'm saying that as someone with dim, nostalgia-goggles memories of long-ago Saturday mornings watching Spiderman and his Amazing Friends, and who became hooked on Spiderman lore due to the 1990s animated series).  It's produced by Greg Weisman of Gargoyles fan, so like that show, The Spectacular Spiderman also does an excellent job setting up long-running storylines and contains a sprawling and impressive voice cast.  Any longtime fan of the character will find much to enjoy in this series, given that it borrows from nearly every incarnation of the character that preceded it; there are direct adaptations of the early Lee/Ditko issues, characterizations and motivations derived from both the Ultimate Spiderman comics and the Sam Raimi movies, even a subtle reference to the terrible 1970s live-action show.  Nearly every villain and supporting  character from the comics appears in the show (seriously, they even included Dr. Bromwell as a recurring character).  My only criticism of this Blu-ray set is the arrangement of the disc menus, which list all of the episodes from that season, not just the episodes contained on that disc, which is, at worst, only mildly annoying, but it made me long for the early days of DVDs with episode guide paper inserts.  As for the show, just be warned that it was cancelled after the 2nd season, so the last episode will leave you wanting more - like all great shows.  This was one of the last Saturday morning cartoons, but if this had to be the last, they went out with a bang.",1452988800,3,1600,4.9700374531835205
6263733,2,B00IGVJH0E,"You know, Somebody must've really been smoking some serious dust to think this series comes anywhere close to the more adult and fast paced Spider-Man TAS in '94.. The dull ass colors the boring narration by Peter and animation itself doesn't even compare. The IGN voted this better than ANY of the previous series. This is total BS. I rate it at close to the bottom and it don't compete with the original in '66 either. The Ultimate Spider-Man series was ok but again too elementary school for mu taste. The '94 is the bar and nothing is close yet. The voice actors alone cannot be touched so this comparison is bogus.",1452470400,,619,4.535714285714286

6263742,3,B00IGVJH0E,"I'm sorry but I just can't get into this show. After seeing all the
positive reviews about it, I decided to give it a try. I barely got
through an episode! I know it sounds kind of silly but I just can't get
past the character designs and the overall look of the show. To me
everything and everyone just look silly, childish and so cartoony. I
just can't take it seriously. I know it probably has good writing and
voice actors and all that, but to me it just looks too childish. Also,
why is Spider-Man so skinny. He's seriously the same size as Gwen and
MJ! And Venom has tiny legs and Doctor Octopus just looks weird. And
what's up with the Green Goblin's chin?

I grew up on the 90s Spider-Man: TAS and to me it just doesn't get any better than that. I know the animation isn't great compared to modern stuff, but I can easily look past that due to the great writing, voice acting and character designs. Anyway, I gave it a shot, but the Spectacular Spider-Man just isn't for me.",1440720000,2,982,4.251336898395722

6263752,4,B00IGVJH0E,"I had never seen this series...I'm old(er) and remember the 1967 series where they used the same show (effects and action scenes) done over and over again with minor changes to storyline.

Well, I've watched many of these episodes now and this really is an improvement in quality and action too. The stories are pretty good usually with a moral. The blu-ray video and sound also makes this an exciting series to enjoy. This really is close to being a 5 star series albeit, the voice overs may lack some authenticity.

Overall, this is a great series to have in my DVD collection and I recommend this for anyone (like me) who hasn't ever seen it before and I would let kids watch this too.",1431648000,,688,4.496

It is very unfortunate how this series only lasted two seasons due to Sony and Marvel contract stipulations.  This without a doubt was well voice acted, well animated and most importantly, well written.  The love for early Stan Lee/Steve Ditko stories is evident with the homages throughout the show's run.  I can't stress how much respect The Spectacular Spider-Man had for early and classic Spider-Man comics.

If you love Spider-Man, superheroes, comics or even just animation, there is no excuse not to watch this show especially now that the full run is on Blu-ray!",1427328000,3,663,5.045871559633028

I was really looking forward to see in what direction they were going to take the characters in the third season.  I am finally coming to grips with the fact that we will never see the fully realized vision.  But at least we have these 26 action packed episodes.  One of the strengths of the show was its willingness to borrow from different story lines and then move the characters around to spice the story up.  I must say that the Green goblin in the show is my favorite representation of the character.  Anyway, if you like Spidey or if you are looking for a good show to watch with the kids then pick this up, you won't be disappointed!",1423785600,,785,4.193333333333333
6263764,5,B00IGVJH0E,"The best cartoon, in the best definition I've ever seen. Definitely worth the purchase - and this way was also cost efficient because buying each volume for less definition would cost eighty bucks at a real store. That doesn't even include tax.

For those who don't know the story of Spider-Man, I'll catch you up on the plot of the show. The show stars Peter Parker (voiced by Josh Keaton), a sixteen year old boy who is secretly Manhattan's super hero, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This is an account of his hardest challenges, from the first super villain to the fate of the Green Goblin. This doesn't just focus on Peter's heroic acts in taking down criminal empires and stopping possible world-wide domination, however. We get to see him struggle with his personal life versus his hero life.
The show isn't just about Peter, either. We also see what's going on with his friends' lives and even the criminal's lives. This makes it a spectacular cartoon. However, it was sad since the season 2 finale was sad, and Disney stole the rights before Sony could make season 3. Even with the sad finale, it was the best cartoon I have ever found.

Now, about the disc set....the only problem is that Disc 2 doesn't like to stay in its slot, so I'd be careful when opening and closing the DVD case.

Disc 1: Episodes 1-7
Disc 2: Episodes 8-13
Disc 3: Episodes 14-20
Disc 4: Episodes 21-26

The storyline adheres more closely to the comic books. The gang are all here. Sinister Six, Aunt May, J J Jameson, Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Black Cat, jocks and bullies. Even more, Peter actually uses and relies on his mechanical web shooters. The series is witty, poignant, and action-packed.  Its animation style is simpler, hand drawn looked, and more fluid than the MTV's fully CGI Spiderman. The only letdown is the somewhat lackluster animation of the series' second half. As for the blu rays, the inclusion of English subtitles, both regular and SDH, scores high in my book. Anyway, I enjoy this series' fun take on our friendly webslinger.",1413590400,,817,4.920289855072464

6263784,5,B00IGVJH0E,"These series honestly amazes me still after watching through the whole thing multiple times. It is so well thought out. You can tell there is a lot of heart in this, but also a lot of expert writing. The animation is fluid, Spider-man moves very well and the action is well choreographed in every fight. I'm glad to see this iteration of Spider-man has him as a fun-loving crime fighter with a wealth of entertaining banter. Each episode is tied very well together, and character development throughout the 2 seasons is phenomenal.

This honestly is the purest, most perfect form of spider-man you can find in the media in this day and age. I highly recommend it to any fan of Spider-Man.

As for the product and packaging, everything is neat and tidy without flaw. I kinda wish it was on DVD so I could watch it on my computer, but you can't win them all. (while I'm wishing things, I wish they could make more, but the rights of Spider-Man transferred from Sony to Marvel or vice-versa, and now one owns the plot and characters, but one owns the rights to Spider-Man, so it can't be made by anyone anymore)",1412208000,3,1108,4.507462686567164

6263786,5,B00IGVJH0E,"When high school teen Peter Parker attends a science exhibit, his life is soon forever changed. During a demonstration on radioactive rays, a spider accidentally absorbs some of the radiation. Parker is bitten by the spider and later learns he has obtained the spiders abilities. Now calling himself Spider-Man, Peter chooses to use his powers for the good of mankind by bringing criminals to justice. -summary

I have to admit that I was one of those individuals whom put this show off for years simply because I didn't care for the wacky like character designs, also at the same time I never really cared for Spider-Man in animated form,  and I have that atrocious 90's animated Spider-Man series to thank for that. I mean seriously, that take on Spider-Man and his universe put a nasty taste in my mouth. Recently I decided to go ahead and dive into this series hoping for good things, and it was indeed money and time well spent. The Spectacular Spider-Man is 26 episodes of solid storytelling and above average animation; as a fan of the character I can say this is Spider-Man finally done right.

It's ironic that the visuals were originally the aspect of this series that put me off, but now they're my first point of praise. I love the fluid animation going on here; everything looks amazing from Spider-Man's graceful web-slinging to his superior agility during evasive action. There is very little to no reliance on re-used cels, with all movements being very well choreographed. The action segments are too much fun to watch, consisting of some over the top aerial chases and hand to hand. Spider-Man's world is a place where the imagination can run wild, and the animators along with screen writers managed to do just that. The character designs grew on me quicker than I realized with some nice updates to many of the villains. The female characters are rather tame; they're cute without being overly sexy except maybe Black Cat, there's quite a bit of sex appeal with her. The BGM and voice acting further brings out the show's style, with some very talented voice work delivered by Josh Keaton, whom clearly has Spider-Man down to a science; with the always cool Clancy Brown and Steve Blum sporting their goods as well.

Although I love the stylistic edge of this show, I have to praise the writing as the strongest point. I remember all of these storylines in their original form, and I love the modern twist to these old classics. Please ignore those purist out there that claim classics were ruined here for a newer audience because this is not the case. Peter Parker's life is almost as interesting as Spider-Man's; with him forced to deal with being an outcast along with his friends, plus hoping to see where his relationships are going to go with the Parker luck in full effect. Spider-Man also has one of, perhaps the most notorious rogues galleries in comics and each of his villains such as Dr. Octopus, Electro, and even Kraven are still just as great as in the comic with some nice makeovers. However, it's Tombstone that received the best makeover being extremely OP despite being pretty tough in the comic anyway. I also must point out how newbie friendly this show is. The writing doesn't demand that a new audience must be familiar in order to enjoy the characters; we're given solid origins and reasons for the characters thinking. The series is so much fun to watch and I couldn't wait for the next episode; I can't think of one moment where I got the crave to see something else. If there's only one issue I have with the writing, then it's how Venom was handled at one point. It's clear that he really hates Spider-Man but he wants Spider-Man only for himself, and he considers it unfair to drag anyone else into their feud, in which he does here. I felt that the episode was unbelievable in how it was wrapped up. Still, this is a small gripe only as a comic fan.

Clocking in at nearly 10 hours across 4 disk, The Spectacular Spider-Man is a great show to spend the weekend. The comedy doesn't feel forced at all nor does it even slightly ruin the atmosphere. There's just a perfect blend of entertainment that adults of all ages can enjoy. The language is profanity free and although there is plenty of action and even violence, it's all very tame and doesn't even begin to approach many of the more harsh DC animated films out there. Along with adults this series is great for the kids as well.  I can imagine some old school fans not appreciating some changes from the original source material; other than this there's nothing to really complain about. The Blu-Ray looks and sounds very good, plus there's a couple of extras. Highly recommended.

Pros: Very fluid animation and solid writing, good viewing for everyone

Cons: Some purist may not like the various changes",1411862400,,4811,4.698695136417556
6263787,5,B00IGVJH0E,Simply put this is a must buy for any Spiderman fan and easily one of the best animated shows ever made.

The special features are sparce but not surprising how unceremoniously the show was cancelled but it is a price worth paying to have it released on Blu-ray instead of DVD.,1411689600,,362,4.231884057971015

6263789,5,B00IGVJH0E,"In my opinion, this is the best version of Spider-man to be presented outside the comic medium.

Good storytelling, pacing, and animation. They took the time to think ahead, so it feels like a real interconnected story that makes sense not just a random collection of isolated tales, but they still WORK as stand alone stories.",1411257600,,327,4.839285714285714
6263790,5,B00IGVJH0E,"My absolute favorite version of the web-head put to animation.  And ironically, I thought it was going to be awful when I first started seeing the initial designs, and hearing that the focus was going to be on Peter when he was still in high school.  Heck, I grew up watching the 90's Spider-Man Animated Series, how could it get better than that?  I was thankfully very wrong, Greg Weisman did a beautiful job crafting a familiar, but still fresh and even mixed up version of old Spider-Man stories, I truly wish we'd gotten into season 3!  You're still given a wonderful helping of Spidey's villains, both well known and not.  The voice acting is so good too, everyone really fit their roles perfectly and the whole thing just feels...right.  This series makes me happy, more than the awful ""Amazing"" movies ever did, and FAR more than Ultimate Spider-Man could dream of.

The animation helps set it apart for one, the battles are alive and clever, Spider-Man feels like Spider-Man should with his movements, and the writing is actually well done too!  Jokes are funny, plot twists happen, you're introduced to characters and actually feel intrigued by their presence.  I really can't get enough of this show!

The blu-ray is great, albeit lacking any worthwhile special features.  Truthfully it's just nice to have the entire series all together for once, regardless.  If you like Spider-Man, you owe it to yourself to watch this series.",1411084800,,1440,4.85655737704918

Season 1 gives you so much heart, and the stories make sense and you feel for these characters and like who they develop to be.  One thing i always give this show credit for is it's incredible fight scenes.  It's like the director knew exactly how Spider-man would fight, especially against the likes of Venom.  They were not simply confined to a single room or building, but they are all over the place, utilizing their powers to the fullest.  And that goes for ALL characters!

Usually when you have team fights you have the enemies attack all at one time, but here against the Sinister Six they don't all attack at the same time for Spider-man has dissabled them for the moment.  It was an incredible fight, don't believe me just youtube it.

Season 2 falls completely short with predictable stories, mundane acting, and just...awful presentation.

6263805,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Without a doubt, ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" animated series is one of - if not the best - cartoon adaptations of everyone's favorite wall-crawling, web-slinging, wise-cracking, arachnid-based superhero. Some might be put off by the unique art-style of the show, but if you give it a chance, you will come to appreciate it for the cartoon-ish character designs allow for the animators to create fluid and exciting action sequences, many of which are among the best western animation has to offer.

This show has its own continuity, separate from the movies and other shows, but it also pays homage to them as well as the original comic story-lines. It retains the heroic spirit of Spider-Man while at the same time making the universe feel fresh and new. What hold it all together, however, is the fantastic writing in combination with an equally stellar cast of voice-actors, who breath life into familiar faces such as Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Harry Osborn, J. Jonah Jameson, and other supporting characters.

I have viewed other animations of Spider-Man, and while there are some that have a more mature animation to them (e.g. Spider-Man: The New animated Series - Special Edition),  this particular series is geared for my pre-school son. And the consolation prize is that I really enjoy watching them with him!  He really likes the theme song to this series.

Naturally after I buy Season One and all the Season Two episodes in non-Blu-ray, they come out with the complete series in Blu-ray.  You may say, I just should have waited but there never was any hint that this would eventually be a complete series in Blu-ray.  In my humble opinion, its everyone trying to make as much money as they can and to hell with the consumer/fan.  Aside from my commentary, the complete Series Blu-ray is excellent.

The quality is pretty good, but you can see some of the shoddier animation techniques used to get this out, especially when frames were zoomed into, that's the beauty of animation on blu--it can look pretty ugly.

But what works here are the characters who are pitch perfect for me. I didn't really connect with Spider-Man until the Ultimate Spider-Man comics and I think this does a fairly good job mirroring that high school world Bendis set his Spidey in.

Im going to say this right now The Spectacular Spider-Man looks spectacular on Blu-Ray. And this is without a doubt the best adaptation of Spider-Man, and one of the best Comic book adaptations of all time. Honestly this series gets all the characters right. Previous animated series of Spider-Man and the live action films can not come close to The Spectacular Spider-Man. For once I enjoy every character I see in the spider universe besides the comics of course, But the characters are just amazing in this series. The series has humor, good plot and story, and you get to see the problems of peter parkers everyday life, as well as for the other characters. When you finish a episode it leaves you with wanting more. It is true to the source material. This series is also for all ages from children to teenagers and adults.

Heard it ended due to Marvel/Sony dispute over rights further complicated by Disney's Marvel acquisition. We really wanted more Spidey, Green Goblin, and debut of fan favorite villains like Carnage, Scorpion etc. Oh well :(

The audio and video here are incredible, by the way. Would have appreciated more special features though. (Perhaps few unreleased episodes/storyboards of them?)

6263847,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Spectacular Spiderman is one of the best animated shows of the last 10 years. It's deeply charming, and surprisingly experimental. It's easily the best screen adaption of Spiderman and his foes!

A few highlights: Peter Parker's high school friends are fleshed out beyond the usual tired stereotypes; the voice acting is phenomenal, with an especially fantastic Doc Oc; and the second season gets increasingly creative (and frankly brilliant) with the way the episodes are structured and themes are conveyed. It's also far more positive in terms of gender and racial diversity than most shows.

It's about time this is finally available as a full 2-season DVD set!

This DVD is great for: children (above 8), teenagers, adults, those who love superheroes, and those who aren't into superheroes yet. There are a lot of Spiderman cartoons out there, but don't be deceived -- this one is the gold!",1399507200,,894,5.068027210884353

6263854,5,B00IGVJH0E,"2008's The Spectacular Spider-Man distills the best of all previous incarnations of the webslinger- movies, TV, Ultimate comics, all the way back to Lee & Ditko's original comics- into two seasons of nigh-perfection. With a stylized visual approach that's thrilling without being truly scary, this is the only Spider-Man media that I can recommend to web-heads of literally any age.

This series returns Spider-Man to his roots, as a high-school student in a world where super-powers are still rare and frightening. This Spidey, as in the movies, can't rely on the Avengers or the Fantastic Four to bail him out: he's the only hero that stands between New York City and the various villains crawling out of the woodwork. The stakes are raised, and Spider-Man's choices have greater impact.

Spectacular Spider-Man takes the refreshing step of not beginning with an origin story: viewers get right away to what we came to see, and the foundational tragedy of Uncle Ben is put off until a flashback episode (""Intervention"") at the end of the first season. This frames Ben's death in a much gentler way for younger viewers since we've already seen what happens after while not undercutting the power/responsibility moral, thanks to the strong writing of show runner Greg Weisman.

The one caveat I must give, particularly for parents, is that the series ends on a cliffhanger that isn't exactly happy (it was cancelled during the ramp-up to production of a third season). Imagine if ""Empire Strikes Back"" were the end of the Star Wars saga and you've got the general idea. It's very much worth watching, but be prepared for a discussion with your child of ""what do you think would happen next?""",1398729600,2,1691,4.968197879858657
6263855,5,B00IGVJH0E,"In the areas the matter most--plot, character development, dialogue, and pacing--this series soars above every iteration of the Spider-Man story and arguably, above any other animated superhero television show, Batman: The Animated Series included.

The Spectacular Spider-Man can be enjoyed by people of any age, with the physical comedy and intense action aimed to satisfy all and the subtext and literary reference appealing to the more discerning.

As for the video and audio fidelity, they are good. Outside of occasional aliasing, no other artifacts were visible. The animation is simple and clean. The audio is largely dynamic and enveloping.

The extras, although enjoyable, are sparse and have been released previously. While it would be futile to hope for much more, director/writer commentary and the extended scenes would have been a welcome addition.

6263860,5,B00IGVJH0E,"Well, I just spent the last ten hours marathoning my ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" Blu-ray. Time well spent, as this is not only the greatest Spider-Man animated series of all time, not only the greatest Spider-Man adaptation of all time, but one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time, period. It stands shoulder to shoulder with ""Batman the Animated Series"" and Joss Whedon's live action ""Avengers"" film, it's that good.

I've watched this series a lot since it premiered, I owned the DVD's, I've seen it on Vortexx's website, but I've never seen it look this good. The lines were sharp, the colors vibrant... it was like seeing it again for the first time.

A terrific re-imagining of Spider-Man's mythos. Spidey and Peter Parker are perfectly portrayed by Josh Keaton. Likewise, Lacey Chabert is great as Gwen Stacy; Vanessa Marshall is everything I ever wanted in Mary Jane Watson; Alan Rachins' Norman Osborn is a cold bastard and Steve Blum's Green Goblin is wonderfully psychotic and creepy. Every character is wonderful.

I think Sony could learn a lot from this show as they continue to adapt Spidey to the big screen, and Marvel could learn a lot as they continue to publish the comics and adapt him to the small screen. This series was absolutely perfect. Sharp writing, top notch voice acting, breathtaking animation. The only thing I would change would be to add at least another three seasons.

The plots are almost perfectly adapted from the comics. This is the most faithful version of the comics I've ever seen. And dare I say it may even be better. Every character is pulled straight from the comics and every character is given a fair amount of development. I've found myself even caring for the villains and seeing it from their point of view at times. I'm also not ashamed to say one episode got me a little misty eyed. It really is that compelling. Spider-Man is as funny as ever. His quips have made me and my son laugh so hard we've had to pause the show so we wouldn't miss anything.

Hailing from 2008, this animated series came right on the heels of the Tobey Maguire era, so there are obviously tropes and homages to the films within the series.  This was the Spider-man we needed, and to be honest, I feel this series may have inspired current film Spider-man Tom Holland.  The series has Parker as a sarcastic, witty, intelligent, yet awkward teen.  He's unpopular, but as the series progresses, he gains some popularity, albeit through the poor choices that someone his age might make, like choosing the cheerleader over your childhood friend who clearly likes you, but I digress.  The series only loses a star in my book for the artwork.  The artwork is fine, but all cartoons around this time remind me of Jeff Matsuda's work (The Batman, Jackie Chan Adventures).
