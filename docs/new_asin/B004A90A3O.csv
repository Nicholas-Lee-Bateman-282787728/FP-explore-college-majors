8419749,2,B004A90A3O,Disappointed at the basic level of the teaching.  Maybe it is good for beginners.,1505088000,,81,4.785714285714286
8419750,4,B004A90A3O,"Baba Dez: Personal Growth and Planetary Arousal (25 mins) okay, and some interesting points - but a bit too vague and esoteric for my taste.

Betty Dodson & Carlin Ross: ""Harnessing Technology"" (37 mins). Betty and Carlin talk about content on their website, and becoming joined plaintiffs in a law suit against the US government over the 2257 Regulations. I liked this one, its fun and interesting. Their bottom line: masturbation is the foundation of all sexuality - it helps to eliminate 'genital shame' (which both men and women suffer from), and it fuels your 'partnersex' practice. If you learn this, you'll be more grounded (in your personal power) and liberated - and its harder to frighten or control liberated people. If you've seen Betty's ""Bodysex"" workshop DVD, you'll recognise the story about the NOW conference, where she did a vulva slideshow.

Charles Muir: ""Daikinis of the Future"" (60 mins). Pretty 'out there', if you know nothing about Charles Muir and Tantra (I didn't!), but still interesting.  Muir reminds practitioners about why they became tantric healers, and what the work requires from them. Will probably watch this one again.",1487980800,,1158,5.116402116402116
8419751,2,B004A90A3O,"Betty and Carlin talking about genital shame, sex education/legal stuff, and uses of technology for healing. Lots of personal anecdotes and humor.

The problem is that the video rental offers only 38 minutes of the 138 minute DVD. Why offer a third of the video? No other speakers are present. Not worth it.",1298678400,5,307,4.7924528301886795
