3528764,5,B001DE29OM,"This is one of Barney's best! It may not keep the toddlers completely entertained because of the story. It's not just endless singing & dancing. There's an actual story here. It also dives into some Christmas traditions. The music is catchy & the holiday tunes stay true to the original lyrics! We bought this video when our children were toddlers & wore it out! We have ordered it this year on DVD & will now include it in our Christmas movie collection! It won't win an Academy award, but if your looking for some nice holiday family fun, this may just do the trick.",1258761600,,568,4.471153846153846
3528765,2,B001DE29OM,"***Parent Annoyance Meter Rating: 4*** (1= not annoying whatsoever, I would watch this without my child - 5=If I have to watch this again, someone better bring me a straitjacket)

While most Barney DVDs have lots of singing and dancing, this one is pretty slow, especially at the beginning, and has too much talking. My two-year-old cries for me to change it every time I put it in. I am hoping that when she gets a little older she will like it. Its not one of my favorite Barney episodes either.

I would recommend passing on this one and going for one of the Barney's that have more singing and dancing like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Let-s-Play-School/dp/B00000IXC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney - Let's Play School</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Let-s-Go-To-the-Farm/dp/B0006L0LPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney: Let's Go To the Farm</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Songs-From-The-Park/dp/B00007FCTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney Songs - From The Park</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Movin-and-Groovin/dp/B0000DJYOR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney - Movin' and Groovin'</a>.",1258243200,3,1295,8.112676056338028

3528820,5,B001DE29OM,"Barney has obviously had some budget cuts in recent years and the episodes on TV are just awful. I turned on an episode for my son and was stunned to see how far downhill it's gone. My son still was interested but I was sick of the same 4 episodes we had On Demand. The actors can't sing, and in the Christmas episode they just aired, the elves were lip syncing to what sounded like a $10 boombox on the set. This is much different than the Barney I remember the younger members of my family watching 10-15 years ago, especially when Michael, the original Keisha, Sandy, and that whole original crew was on. They could all carry a tune and were decent little actors. I think this is the set of actors that came after that bunch, and they're still good enough to watch. This is by far the best Christmas movie that has been released, and my son didn't budge once the entire hour that we first put this on for him. That was a month ago, and he asks to watch ""Barney snow"" or ""Barney train"" (they take a train ride in Santa's factory) EVERYDAY. My little cousins had this movie and it brings back good memories of being at home with them. I would stick to any Barney movie that is early 2000's or in the 90's. The stuff on TV is just garbage.",1357430400,10,1239,4.2100840336134455
