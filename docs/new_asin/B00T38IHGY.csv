8700105,5,B00T38IHGY,"Beautifully shot in black and white, 'Hard to Be a God' presents a spectacular procession of grotesque medieval imagery. For nearly three hours, its characters battle, spit, fart, urinate and grimace, while bird droppings fall from the sky amidst a curtain of foul steam rising from the ground. This visual vocabulary is used insistently, relentlessly, like a mantra, to the point that it nearly becomes hypnotic. The result is, nevertheless, a tasteful, even elegant, and superbly crafted product.

'Hard to Be a God' is inspired by the novel of the same title, by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (which I'm not familiar with). Technically speaking, this is a science fiction story, but expect nothing like '2001: Space Odyssey' or 'Star Trek'. If anything, its aesthetics have more in common with Andrei Tarkovsky's 1966 'Andrei Rublev', which is set in 15th century Russia. The plot goes something like this: In the future, a number of earthlings go to planet Arkanar to observe its culture, which is in a similar state to what was once the Earth's Middle Ages. However, they are not allowed to teach the locals any progressive concepts that might help them reach their own Renaissance. At best, they can protect a few, specific Arkanarians who may be instrumental in the advancement of their society. Some of this is explained in an introduction. The rest, one has to more or less guess, based on the sometimes disorienting action and sparse dialog. There is a lot to take in at once, so I believe a second viewing would be helpful.

The surreal parade of people fighting one another and marching through the mud like madmen is so overwhelming, that it is almost comical during some instances. This said, it is grim to see human beings reduced to pointless violence and physiological functions. The visitors from Earth are more scientifically advanced, to the point that they are perceived by the locals as gods; but they despair as they confront the seemingly endless chaos. Thus, the title. Most Arkanarians are primitive and superstitious, while the scientists are false gods, lacking hope or divine inspiration. Not exactly uplifting, but it's a sight to behold...

Director Aleksei German spent many years working on this elaborate production and died before completing it. His wife and son took over that task and finished it in 2013.",1459209600,,2340,5.010282776349614
8700106,5,B00T38IHGY,"I have never seen anything like this. A breathtaking medieval world, so believable and interesting that the plot really doesn't need much focus. Just let your eyes wander for three hours and you will see a side of humanity like never before. Long graceful shots mixed with great sound creates a world that must be experienced. Dirty, muddy and gory. May not be for everyone, but fell in love with it.",1431216000,,400,4.647887323943662
8700107,5,B00T38IHGY,"I am very happy to have acquired this film by a director who has  passed away...It is the kind of art film that I feel expresses a certain form of story telling in a very slow but effect way..Since it was filmed in black and white, it makes the film more powerful and clear with the message the writer and director are trying to convey to their audience.  I am happy to be one of their audience.  I will try to acquire more of Boris Strugatsky's films.  Wonderful and true art, in my own words....",1428105600,,497,4.2

8700109,3,B00T38IHGY,"Just saw it yesterday at the movie theatre in Paris. Supposedly based on the 1964 sci-fi novel of Arcadi and Boris Strugatsky, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-to-Be-a-God/dp/1613748280/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard to Be a God</a>"", but you'd better have read the novel before, or read about the film, to understand what the film is about, and simply who is who. There is no discernible ""plot"" in the usual sense, no development, no thread, no line leading from a ""beginning"" to an ""end"". What it offers is three hours of deep immersion in a black and white medieval world of mud, filth, s***, slit, snot, rot, vomit, bowels, fog and fumes, constantly pouring and drenching rain to make Scotland look like a summer resort, unrelieved brutality, deformed muzzles of madmen. Fabulous camera work, always on the move, always glued to the main character (Don Rumata, portrayed by Leonid Yamolnik), always encumbered by other characters criss-crossing its and our view and sometimes looking at it/us, breathtaking sets and props, they too litteraly filling, even choking the camera view, all generating a constant sense of claustrophobia. Is this what the remotest villages of Mujiks in famine-stricken 19th century rural Russia or early 20th century rural Soviet Union looked like? Only by Russians could such a film have been made.

It's a film that's immensely physical, tactile, impressionistic, gutsy, leaving you no space to think and hardly any to even breathe. But in the very same vein, and with a very similar medieval village of mud and very similar preoccupation of man torn betwen lowly flesh and elevated and frail mind, I much preferred&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sokurov-s-Faust-Blu-ray/dp/B00LC4PEEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sokurov's Faust [Blu-ray</a>]: at least, there is a discernible narrative there.

Hard to be a God? I can't help getting the sense that this title and film are autobiographies. The God here is German himself, litterally re-creating, for the camera, with nightmarish realism (intended oxymoron), this medieval world of mud, filth, slit, s***, snot, vomit, bowels, as a metaphor of our human condition. And the story is that it took him six years to film it... like God's six days... and that his death left the film's post-production unfinished... is this what happened to God, too? The film seems to express the notion that intellect, intelligence, culture, science, arts, creativity, creation, will always be crushed by our human condition of mud, slit, s***, snot, vomit, that the human mind, intelligence or ""soul"" is but a flickering flame fleetingly dancing on a lump of barren wax.

(PS: note that the expression ""s***"" is not my writing, but an automated emendation from Amazon. This organization is afraid of calling a spade ""a spade"", and afraid of the reality of our human condition.)",1424822400,10,2927,5.543624161073826
