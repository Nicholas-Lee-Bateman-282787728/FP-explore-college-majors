2395243,4,B000AXWHBM,"I am pleased to say that CSI NY was not a disapointment.  I liked the story lines for the show and Gary Sinise helps bring the cast together. NY reminds me more of the orignal CSI which is why I enjoyed it.

  Good visuals and cliffhanging moments makes this one worth owning.  Anyone who is a CSI fan will enjoy this season.",1132963200,2,325,4.17741935483871
2395244,3,B000AXWHBM,"Okay I admit that their visual effects are supreb.

So many breath taking momoments.

But the story is not that creative enough as in the original CSI or CSI Miami.

And how many ""blow fish-FUGU-"" episode can you take?...

Most of all how come in this seriese they avoid Asians?

They need to have at least one Asian in the cast...

Hey after all it takes place in New york.",1131321600,3,374,4.271428571428571
2395245,5,B000AXWHBM,"Shows that launch spinoffs learn that the spinoff can either be a hit or miss gamble for the network.  When NBC launched spinoffs from its hit show Law and Order it found that for every hit (Special Victims Unit and Criminal Intent)there can also be one major misfire (Trial by Jury, which was cancelled after less than a season).

So when CBS announced in 2004 that it planned to launch a second spinoff show from its mega-successful CSI, many fans might have thought that it might have followed right along the same path as L&O: Trial by Jury.  So what happened?

In 2004, CSI: New York was launched and it followed right in the footsteps of its big brothers CSI (or CSI: Vegas) and CSI: Miami in establishing itself not as a lesser of the two set in a new city but one that could stand alone just as well, especially seeing that it would have the fan bases of the more established CSI shows to build on.

CSI: NY focuses on the New York City Crime Lab, led by Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise), a police officer who's dedication to the job is overshadowed by the grief that still lives within him due to his wife being killed in the 9/11 attack of the World Trade Center. Mac's demeanor is like a cross between his counterparts Gil Grissom and Horatio Caine, only more equal to each.

His team includes Stella Bonasera (Melina Kanakaredes), tough talker Danny Messer (Carmine Giovanazzo), young up and coming CSI Aiden Burn (Vanessa Ferlito, who left the show in the recently begun second season), medical examiner Sheldon Hawkes (Hill Harper), and street officer Don Flack (Eddie Cahill), who has little patience for anyone that doesn't want to talk.

Their cases in the first season of CSI: NY sees the team dealing with some rather unique cases including one where the CSI team has to solve the murder of a dock worker, but has to deal with the fact that no one wants to talk to them and try to help them get to the bottom of the case.

The Complete First Season contains 24 episodes on 7 discs.  Discs 1-6 contain all 24 episodes (23 episodes plus the original pilot episode of CSI: Miami that sent Horatio Caine (David Caruso) to New York to track a killer)and audio commentaries on 7 of the 24 episodes, while the 7th disc contains several bonus features including the tour of the CSI New York set, an interview with the cast and more.

For CSI fans, this is the first of 3 CSI season releases within the next few weeks (Miami releases its 3rd season on November 22nd, followed exactly one week later by Vegas' 5th season on the 29th).  So for those that need to see if Little Brother can stand up on its own against its older siblings, do a little investigating of CSI: NY.",1130630400,4,2684,4.479508196721311
2395246,4,B000AXWHBM,"Crime Scene Investigation: New York (CSI) is the second follow-up of the original CSI, which takes place in Las Vegas.  The first sequel to CSI offered the 60 million dedicated viewers to the initial series a location change, as the sequel is set in the subtropical Miami.  However, in one episode of CSI: Miami, a cold-blooded murderer brought the investigation to New York to find the killer.  This development gave grounds for another change of scenery, which gave the viewers a chance to see the nitty-gritty indifference of the unsympathetic Big Apple's criminals.  The mood in CSI: NY is far grimmer and more distant from humanity than its predecessors, as the bluish tone of the photography enhances the cold and unfeeling mood of this series murderous trail.

The first disc of this set of discs offers an opportunity for the audience to experience the initial episode from CSI: Miami that sets up CSI: NY.  In this episode the forensic-analyst, Caine (David Caruso) of Miami-Dade crime lab, investigates a grisly double murder, which leads them to New York.  Once in New York, Caine begins to cooperate with Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) to find the answers of the callous murderer's identity, as they put their two sharp minds together to solve the crime.  In the opening of CSI: NY, the discovery of a female body neatly dressed and with no visible signs of struggle, or harm, immediately sets the tone of Mac's bleak world.  To further the desolated atmosphere of CSI: NY, the audience learns about Mac's late wife who died during the 9/11 attack in Manhattan, which affects his sleeping patterns.

CSI: NY has a number of interesting characters, besides Mac, such as the dedicated Detective Stella Bonasera (Melina Kanakaredes) and Danny Messer (Carmine Giovinazzo).  There is also the disillusioned doctor Sheldon Hawkes who has left his job as a doctor due to failure, and then there is the hot-tempered Don Flack (Eddie Cahill).  The combination between these characters led by Mac and the horrific crimes that fall in their lap allows the audience to enter a dark and sinister domain, as they seek through scientific methods find the clue that solves the case.  The TV series is not really entertainment, as it has some gruesome stories.  However, CSI: NY offers an interesting and suspenseful perspective on science in the legal system, which also offers an interesting viewpoint on life and its function.  It truly presents a rather fascinating experience, which definitely is worth the time.

CSI: NY brings the viewers an intriguingly dark police drama where science is the main tool in their investigation.  The success on the show rests within the cast's chemistry and their performances, as they all enhance the experience with multifaceted individuality and persona.  In addition, each episode presents a unique perspective on innovatively gruesome crimes and how the law enforcement pursues the criminals with relentless dedication.  Thus, adding a third location to the CSI franchise was a good decision, as it still serves a large audience a suspenseful and captivating visual event.",1129852800,26,3116,5.0984251968503935
2395247,5,B000AXWHBM,"I have been a fan of CSI and CSI: Miami for quite a while now, so when I heard that a third incarnation of this fantastic show was going to come out, I was excited. I found it very easy to get into CSI: NY, even more so than Vegas or Miami--I think it had something to do with the incredible cast that was assembled for New York. Gary Sinise is one of my favorite actors, and I found his character Mac to be a much more likeable lead CSI than either Grissom or Horatio (Grissom has been varying degrees of antisocial and oblivious over the seasons, and Horatio gets more than a little bit aggravating sometimes with the way he talks and stands, arms akimbo, while the other CSIs process the scene.) Don't get me wrong, I love Vegas and Miami, but New York has become my definite favorite.

  I liked the fact that, in this CSI, the viewers got some of the characters' backgrounds early on, rather than waiting forever (such as the 5 season wait to find out why in the world Sarah from Vegas gets so belligerent when spousal abuse is involved). Each of the characters on New York, as with the first two shows, is unique, and they all complement each other nicely. Stella (Melina Kanakaredes) is a strong, capable woman who works alongside Mac rather than simply taking orders from him. Danny (Carmine Giovinazzo) is brash, funny, and slightly mysterious (viewers get tantalizing hints of his past, although there is still a lot left to be discovered), but there is no denying that he is a good CSI. Aiden (Vanessa Ferlito) is smart and sassy and doesn't take any crap from anyone (particularly not Danny). Don Flack (Eddie Cahill), the main detective on the show, seems like one of the team, as does coroner Sheldon Hawkes (Hill Harper), who becomes a CSI in the second season. None of the characters feel like carbon copies of those from Vegas or Miami, despite what many other people have told me.

  The setting of the show is decidedly dark and gritty, portraying the urban jungle of New York City as a place that is at once beautiful and decrepit, steeped with history and amazingly diverse. There is a blue sort of tint to the first season, much as there is an orange cast to many of Miami's episodes. At first I thought that this would detract from the show, but in the end it just helped to identify New York as being separate from Vegas and Miami.

  Many of the storylines could easily be put on Miami or Vegas, but others are strictly New York (where else would a rat swallow a crucial piece of evidence?). There are a lot of people who say that the CSI franchise is getting too crowded, but the way I see it, if the show is good, who cares? New York is a great addition to the CSI family, but it is also a wonderful show all on its own. NY has had a lot to live up to, and there are those out there who don't give this show a chance, but I would encourage fans to watch and find out for themselves. Sure, Vegas was first, but New York is fresh, fun and just as exciting! I look forward to watching the subsequent seasons.",1129593600,17,3032,4.352212389380531
2395248,5,B000AXWHBM,CSI: New York is undeniably a great addition to the CSI trio. While not reaching the hights of the original CSI it still is a great show with imaginative stories.,1126569600,6,162,4.433333333333334

2395250,3,B000AXWHBM,"I could never get through a full episode of this.  It doesn't live up to the same expectations that CSI original delivers each week.  It's also always a dark grey color and it makes the show seem cold, sterile and univiting.  Out of all the CSI's, none will ever come close to the Las Vegas one and why they've even kept on attempting to is surprising to me.  I do have to say that I like Gary Senese and Melina Kanakaredes.

2395277,2,B000AXWHBM,"This CSI spinoff started pretty strong but after enough episodes into the series it starts to get formulaic and a little too much like the other series (including some zinger puns prior to the credits ala Miami.) I enjoyed the pilot and the dark, brooding picture painted of Gary Sinise's Taylor character but there just want enough of this explored, and now that I've seen CSI:Miami I'm afraid to get into this series fearing that like Horation Caine later in the series, Sinise's character will just start to vanish more and more as the show goes on.
The other charaters in the show just arean't all that likable. Aiden Burn, for instance, is a little too much like the crabby Tim Speedle character from CSI:Miami, and it's basically the same unlikability factor. The stories also fall into some of the oddball Miami-style cases, such as the killer puffer fish sushi, the dog show or the dead circus contortionist, that don't seem to work for NY.
I almost got through the entire series but eventually gave up as the chemistry just isn't really there.
Plus, as a side-note, I don't get the ""Teenage Wasteland"" theme music. Yeah, I get it that they are continuing the Who music-theme, but what does that song have to do with NY? (for that matter, what does ""won't get fooled again"" have to do with CSI:Miami? Did they all get fooled at some point in the crime lab or something?) I mean, they might as well have used ""Boris the Spider"".",1428624000,,1435,4.631372549019608

The show, which obviously takes place in New York, introduces a new cast of characters which, though are not as witty/funny as those in CSI: Las Vegas, take their work very seriously and provide more than enough personality for viewers to fall in love with. The show comes off as darker than the other CSI shows, sometimes in the stories, but especially with the seemingly gray atmosphere with a heavy focus on blacks and whitesas compared to colorful locations such as Miami or Las Vegas.

And like the other CSI entries, I find these characters and their world amazing. I have always viewed television shows from the standpoint of a viewer and not that of someone interested in the mechanics of filmmaking. Each act of every episode kept me on the edge of my seat, not because of the mystery of the story but how the character development, plot and dialogue seem to gel so well. I love the dialogue and denouements and the openings were always spectacular.

2395322,5,B000AXWHBM,"This CSI series is simply great, with interesting main characters and realistic, if sometimes gruesome crimes the investigators are obliged to solve. Gary Sinise, top man in the New York City crime Lab and Melina Kanakaredes, Sinise's partner, head a talented team of forensic experts who are dispatched to crime scenes and from there begin to gather evidence, establish time lines and put together a picture of the crime and follow the trail from there. The camera work is great, as are the state-of-the-art computer equipment the investigators use to zero in on possible suspects. Autopsies are also featured in part on the show, which may be a little offputting for some viewers. The only drawback to this great collection is the lack of sub-titles. Owing to the huge Latin population in New York City, it would seem that the producers would have included Spanish-language subtitles.

The special effects help to explain what we're seeing and the writing makes the suspension of disbelief that much easier.

2395325,5,B000AXWHBM,"After obtaining all 5 seasons of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD & experiencing the letdown that Is Season 5, I decided to go back to where It started. Season 1 Is the only season that was done with Intelligence, care, accuracy, great Special Features, great on the packaging & the discs themselves. The discs were made up with Individual pics of each castmember As their official ID cards. These were done on the 6 episode discs & A full cast photo on the 7th Special Features disc. This Is also the ONLY season to be pressed this way, all of the episodes on their own discs & the Special Features on their own disc(the 7th). This Is also the only season to have commentary spanning the ENTIRE season. Seasons 2, 3 & 4, no commentary on any episode that aired after Christmas, Season 5-NO COMMENTARY AT ALL!!!! Season 1 Is also the only season to carry the look that Showrunner Anthony Zuiker had In mind until Les Moonves stuck his nose where It did not belong. This was the only full season to feature the entire original cast-Gary Sinise, Melina Kanakaredes, Carmine Giovinazzo, Vanessa Ferlito & Hill Harper, eddie Cahill did not show up until BLINK. Season 1 fires on all cylinders, never missing the mark. Season 1 also looked the most like the real New York showcasing New York's color & ethnicities. 0nly 2 episodes feature all white guest casts-THREE GENERATIONS ARE ENOUGH & the finale WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU SEE. The most I could give this season officially Is 5, but In my heart, Season 1 gets 5 trillion. Season 1 Is pure perfection. This Is the season I watch most on DVD. I had hoped this would be the standard bearer for all subsequent seasons, Instead this season Is An aberration. If you are only gonna get any Season of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD, this season Is It.

2395340,5,B000AXWHBM,"I'm a huge fan of forensic crime dramas and have been watching CSI since its inception.  Of the three shows in the CSI franchise I have to say that CSI: New York is my favorite.  Gary Sinise is absolute perfection as the head of the team.  He and Melina Kanakaredes have great chemistry as partners and friends.  The other investigators and Dr. Hawkes, the ME, round out the best CSI team ever built for television.  I never had the opportunity to watch this show as it aired so watching it on DVD really gave me a chance to become invested in the character stories that unravel as the crimes come and go.  Initially I thought the character of Danny Messer would be annoying because he was SO Brooklyn and seemingly cocky.  But by the episode titled ""Tanglewood"" when Sonny Sassone (Michael DeLuise) tries to make Mac doubt Danny's loyalty to his job I found myself shaking my head in defense of Danny and watching Mac's face to make sure he didn't take Sonny's warning seriously.  You can't dis Danny, I love that guy.  I love 'em all.
After the CSI creators made such a mistake in casting David Caruso to play the lead in CSI: Miami (my hometown) I didn't expect their second spin-off to be an improvement on the original.  I'm so glad I gave it a try.

The DVD set is excellent.  I know some people worry about that.  The episodes are slightly out of order if your look at the episode numbers but they fit together perfectly in the DVD order.  The set does include the episode of CSI: Miami where the ever pretentious Horatio Cane travels from Miami to NY to bring a suspect to justice thereby introducing the CSI: New York team.  For as much as I loathe Horatio I'm so glad they did it this way because the lighting difference in the scenes with David Caruso and Gary Sinise together is an artful touch.  New York's lighting is blueish while Miami's is bright yellow.  This is most obvious in one crime scene where Mac is crouched by the victim while Horatio is standing in one bright beam of sunlight coming through the victim's window.  It may be a silly thing to notice but I think it shows the amount of dedication to detail that the director puts into his craft.  CSI is the best American crime drama family and CSI: New York is the bright shining star of that family.",1214006400,,2277,4.430288461538462

2395360,5,B000AXWHBM,"When this first came on TV, the first few episodes were just too downbeat for me and I stopped watching. It didn't have the excitement and color of the Las Vegas and Miami shows.

Well, I turned out to be premature in my judgment of this show. A year later, I obtained the DVD of the first season and thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I thought it might be the best of all three CSI shows but I'll wait on that call until a complete second season is done.

I liked this debut season more than the others for two main reasons:

1 - It did not have all the little soap opera side-stories involving the characters that the two other CSI shows have. Each show was strictly about the crime(s).

2 - All the lead characters are fun to watch and had no annoying personality traits. True, the head guy, played by Gary Sinise, didn't have much of a personality but I liked his low-key, no-nonsense approach. Bill Petersen interjects too much New Age philosophy on his show and David Caruso is so ultra-dramatic that he's almost cartoonish at times. Sinise just does the job with that's it. Same for the rest of the crew. I understand one them, Vanessa Ferlito, left the show after this season, and I'm sorry to hear that. I enjoyed her face and her humor. I can only hope the rest of the cast stays. A good share of the cast seems to be made up of New ""Yawkers"" with that accent and that just adds to the believability of the show.

Although I enjoyed ""Stan,"" played by Carmine Giovinzzo, the best, the most interesting was Melina Kanakaredes. From shot to shot, she's different in appearance from strange and unappealing to gorgeous, depending on the camera angle and lighting. She's hard to figure, both in looks and her character.

I never get tired of those aerial shots of the city, either. Odd they were tinted the blue the first month of the season and then brown-and-gray the rest of the year. As with the other CSI shows, the camera-work is fantastic. Those who have never seen any of the CSI shows on DVD owe themselves a look. They are spectacularly filmed.

However, unlike Miami and Las Vegas CSI shows, this is basically a no-glitz affair with the stories dominating. One problem with these shows is they are filmed on Los Angeles movie sets, so most of the time, because of crowds and other problems in filming locally, you don't see the main characters actually in the locales they are supposed to be. It would be fun watching them chase criminals in Central Park, at the Empire State Building, through Madison Square Garden, etc.",1145836800,,2535,4.509803921568627

You've got diversity all covered with supporting cast, but for pete's sake, it would be really, really nice if just once the lead scientist / detective was, like, as diverse as scientists and detectives are in real life.

It's really well done with good story lines and well developed characters.  I could've done without the first episode (the one after the crossover show with CSI:Miami) only because it seemed to try too hard to be dark and disturbing.  As the season progressed, though, the stories got better and they lightened up on making NY so depressing.  The original CSI is still the best, but this franchise is a really good addition.  If they add another show (and hopefully get rid of CSI:Miami) maybe they could go with somewhere unexpected.  NY was an obvious choice.  It's a big country, how about picking a city that's not featured in every other show on TV?  But I digress, this DVD set is very entertaining and worth owning.",1140652800,3,887,4.432098765432099
2395364,5,B000AXWHBM,"When CSI Producers announced another spin-off series, I have to say that I was very skeptical. So I was pleasantly surprised when I first laid eyes on CSI:NY. The strength of this series is the cast. From the first we saw Gary Sinise in the CSI:Miami Cross-Over Episode (included in this DVD set) most of us knew that this series will be a tad different from the two previous CSIs. Like Grissom, Mac Taylor (Sinise) is a bit unsocial, but he too is scientific and places the physical evidence above all. And like Caine, he is sometimes emotional, thankfully without the annoying pose and sunglasses. The other cast members are also exceptional. I particularly liked Aiden Burn (Ferlito), which unfortunately left the show in its second season. The cast is not as light-hearted as the other two CSI ensembles, but there is some dark humour here, which is actually funny most of the time. Cast aside, most of the scenes from the other CSI shows are here. Nice overviews of the city, and the 'CSI shots.' The NY version though experiments with camera techniques more often than using graphics. Were there any problems? Yes there were. The biggest is  the blue tint used in filming. It is very dark at times and very drowsy at times. Good thing the producers noticed this and lightened it up by the end of the season. Another is the stylized fiction used by the shows (The CSI franchise, that is), that made ripple effects around the world. Some law schools are looking into the shows (some to learn about forensics, some to learn improper legal technicalities); defence lawyers and victims demanding for forensics similar to the show and whatnot. But in the end, I believe that the show is a bit of fact and a bit of fiction, and that I should not bother to find the fine line separating them. As for the DVD, the discs are housed in a book-like manner, which is topped off by a handsome slipcase and a yellow tape similar to those used in the show. The first six discs contain the first season episodes and the CSI:Miami pilot, and a seventh, single-layer, disc contains the special features. Overall, CSI:NY is a great addition to the CSI line-up and the DVD is a must-have if you want to go over this wonderful series.",1138579200,5,2218,4.615189873417721

I feel it is monotonous because every single episode starts with suspense then it concentrates on the wrong person. The last six minutes the Einstein's discover everything.

2395368,2,B000AXWHBM,"Contrary to some of the other reviewers who obviously worship anything labeled CSI, I suggest that this is one derivation that is  neither worth the time nor the money to watch, despite Sinise, and in part, because of his detached and non-committed performance.  Unlike both the Las Vegas and the Miami versions, with less known actors where the locale plays a significant and attractive role, and where we would expect New York to similarly have a lot of interesting sites to offer, this one falls very short in offering the other worldly dimension that the other two do--the first have significant depth of character both in locale and in personnel--this has neither, where we would expect just the opposite.  Even the cases themselves in the NY version seem lackluster, the criminalistics unexciting and in many cases mundane, and the acting devoid of any kind of feeling much less charisma.  I would suggest seeing/buying all of the other CSI series before adding this one to your collection, and for that matter, I would buy any of the Law & Order series in its various incarnations, as well as even ""The Profiler"", before plunging money on this one, even if you could get it used.  Yes, it is crimininal investigation guided by scientific protocol.  Yes, it does employ competent and in one or two individuals, excellent, actors--but that is just it--this one seems to be produced in order to milk the meal ticket that the other CSI series have produced, with second rate scripts, second rate directing, and actors simply going through the motions.  Best to leave this untouched, until perhaps a competent director is found, and is given both imaginative and compelling scripts, as well as more animated and motivated acting--until that happens, which is unlikley, save your money and catch the reruns a few months from now free of charge.",1133827200,5,1845,4.932258064516129
