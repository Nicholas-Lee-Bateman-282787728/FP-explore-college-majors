8407509,5,B003WRBPFW,"I have literally ordered his Calculus I volume sets, Calculus II volume sets, Calculus III volume sets, Differential equations volume sets, and chemistry volume sets.  All of his tutor DVD's are worth every penny, they should be locked up and sent to the smithsonian for the future.  This is not only good for students, but teachers as well.  I let one of my professors which was about to teach calc II for his first time look at these and  he mentioned to me the other day that he got a solid foundation going in to the semester from the DVD.  Yes, sometimes it might be a little dry, but he explains things teachers always miss or don't understand themselves.  You obviously still need to put in the work to further develop your math skills in whatever course your are doing.  What these DVD's give you is a sense of not going in blind if you don't understand the material all the way through.  I can't say enough positive things about these lessons only thing I can say personally is they helped me get through the above mentioned courses.  If you are reading this Jason Gibbs, thanks man.  Thanks for doing what teachers fail to do 90% of the time thanks for picking up their slack.",1473033600,,1186,4.474418604651163

8407514,5,B003WRBPFW,"To start off with, you will really need to pay attention to your schools calculus curriculum.  Most schools have a class that either is exclusively on differential equations and other will have a class that combines linear algebra and differential equations.  In the latter situation it is not uncommon to also have some differential equation material covered in one of the lower level calculus classes.  Usually calculus 2.  My school took that approach so most of what was on this disk (not everything) was covered in calculus 2.  That is where we learned about the separation of variables technique and variation of parameters and did things like the mixing problems.  We also got an introduction to the higher order differential equations that are in volume 2 of this course.

Once I got to Calculus 4, (which at my school was 1/2 linear algebra and 1/2 differential equations) while we did touch on some of this material again, the class was more geared toward using linear algebra concepts to solve systems of differential equations.  The material on this DVD was really a review, (although this did help a lot since I was a couple semesters removed from first learning this) but we went through it really fast.  The one thing we did spend more time with that is on this DVD was drawing the slope fields which Jason does a couple good examples of.

The point is you really need to know the material on this DVD at some point, but you may need it sooner than just your differential equations based class.  Also, there is usually more than one approach to solving differential equations, but if you understand this one you can usually figure out the others pretty easily. Just note that your teacher may present a slightly different method of solving some of them as you see here.  Once you get to systems of differential equations you are really going to be using linear algebra (mainly eigenvalues and eigenvectors), which Jason does not cover here.  The good thing however is that material is usually very easy.",1337126400,5,2018,4.780979827089337
8407515,5,B003WRBPFW,"I used this when I decided to go back to school after 15 plus years without math I needed some help.  The examples and instruction are great,  I would recomend this to anyone taking calculus.",1319155200,,191,4.428571428571429
8407516,5,B003WRBPFW,"I bought the Differential Equations Tutor DVDs because I was taking the course and saw that the creator's other math tutorial DVDs got great reviews, so I decided to try it out. I also bought the second volume from his website to cover more advanced topics in the course. The DVDs turned out to be a great help and explained the topics in a clear albeit little slow manner (which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the fast forward button is definitely an option if you find that you understand the topic).

The first DVD only covers the first couple of weeks in the course which for my class were the first two chapters. These consist of explaining what a differential equation is and showing how to solve first order differential equations (DE) and their applications to real life. The instruction was clear but you should watch the videos either before going to class or after. Don't leave them to watch before your midterm they are way too long to watch all at once.

The second volume is definitely needed if you want to learn how to solve higher order DE, linear DE, and homogeneous & non-homogeneous DE, using the various methods introduced in your math course.

NOTE: The DVDs don't teach you past this and don't contain Laplace transforms (which for me were the second half of the course)! Maybe they will be covered in a third volume which hasn't been released yet but just make sure you find a different source to help you if you need help with them.

Also buy the DVDs from the company itself it'll save you a few bucks.",1315785600,3,1531,4.536231884057971
8407517,4,B003WRBPFW,"The 4 DVD set ""Differential Equations Tutor: Vol. 1, First Order Equations"" features Jason Gibson working problems from the first few chapters of a course on differential equations.  The DVDs cover only ""first order"" equations (those that involve only the first derivative of the unknown function).  Jason works problems that involve manipulations of mathematical symbols.  He also works several types of ""word problems"".  He doesn't work any problems that say ""Explain why...."" or ""Prove that...."" or ""What is the domain of ..."".  Manipulations of mathematical symbols make up the bulk of the material in a traditional course on differential equations, so these DVDs will be a significant help in the first few weeks.

The solution techniques that Jason covers are separation of variables, first order variation of parameters and exact equations.  The ""word problems"" he works involve the mixing of fluids, Newtons Law Of Cooling and  a simple RL series circuit.

Jason has more mercy than most instructors of a differential equations course when it comes to explaining and reviewing the techniques of calculus that are involved, but don't expect  to understand what he's doing unless the elementary procedures for differentiation and integration are fresh in your mind.  Jason does take pains to explain the use of ""integration by parts"" whenever it arises.

Throughout the DVDs, Jason uses 't' as the independent variable and x(t) as the unknown function.  If your text uses 'x' as the independent variable and 'y' as the unknown function, you'll have to learn to translate between these different points of view.  For example, where Jason has dx/dt, your materials will have dy/dx.

Jason speaks spontaneously, but clearly and in an organized manner.  In his early DVD products, we saw a camera fixed on Jason working at a marker board.  In this set of DVDs we have:

A set of sliding marker boards!
A camera that pans and zooms a little!
Places where the video has been edited!
Graphics showing the text of word problems!

Has Jason gone Hollywood?  - only in a relative sense.  These videos are still just old fashioned marker board lectures.

I rate this product as four stars out of five to indicate that it is a good explanation of the solution methods taught in the first few weeks of a differential equations course.

Synopsis

(In this synopsis, I use ""x^p"" to denote x raised to the p power.  I use c_n to indicate the letter 'c' with the subscript 'n'.  I often use the prime notation for higher derivatives since it's simpler to type than the differential notation.)

Disk 1

1)What is a Differential Equation?  (41 minutes)

From a student's point of view, the course in differential equations will have the same feeling as doing integration problems in calculus.  One needs a toolkit of methods to solve differential equations.  Picking the right tool to use on a particular problem is crucial.

Example: dx/dt + 3 = 4
""You are still trying to find the value of x"".  Jason initially calls x a ""variable"", but soon calls it a function.

Example:  F = ma is a differential equation
F/m ""for any given problem is just a number"". (He assumes F and m are constants.)
a = dv/dt = (d^2 x)/ (dt^2)

An ""ordinary"" differential equation (ODE) is one that has no partial derivatives.  The first course in differential equations is really a course in ODEs.  [However,  partial differentiation comes into play in the solution of ODEs in the section on ""exact"" differential equations. ]

The order of a ODE is the order of the highest order derivative of the unknown function.
x''(t) = F/m  is 2nd order.

Example: Solve  d^2x/dt^2 = 30
Label the constants of integration with distinct subscripts.
""Everything we have in this class is going to be a function of time""
The ""General Solution"", describes all possible solutions.  If we are given ""initial conditions"" we can determine the ""specific solution"" to the equation.  He illustrates this by showing different cases for a falling marker: dropping vs throwing it down with initial velocity or throwing it upward
He assumes the initial conditions x(0) = 0 m, x'(0) = 1 m/sec and finds the constants of integration, which produces the specific solution.

2) Solving Elementary Ordinary Differential Equations (47 minutes)

Example: What is the order of the ODE  t^4  + x''' + t x' - x = t^7
Example What is the order of the ODE x^7 x' + x''''''' = x + t^9

Example: Determine if x(t) = e^(3t) is a specific solution to x''' - 9 x'' = 0
Example: Determine if x(t) = ln(-t) for  t < 0 is a specific solution to  tx' = 1

Example: Find the general and specific solutions of x'' = 3t + 1; x(0) = 2, x'(0) = 3

Jason advises that you curl the stem of your ""t""'s to distinguish them from a ""+"".  He also says to cross your ""z""'s so they don't look like a '2'.

Example: Find the general and specific solutions of  x''' = 6; x(0) = x'(0) = x''(0) = 0
[Throughout the DVDs Jason uses and explains the ""fast and loose"" method of handling constants of integration, which is standard in textbooks.  However, he doesn't warn of the possible pitfalls.  For example, in this problem he re-labels the constant ""c_1 / 2"" as ""c_1"" on the grounds that a constant divided by 2 is still a constant.  This is true.  However, if a person is solving an initial value problem that involves finding several constants and setting up simultaneous equations based on previous lines of work, he will have to remember where ""c_1' meant ""c_1"" and where it meant ""c_1 / 2"".  That is not a concern in most problems on these DVDs since there is only 1 constant of integration to worry about in first order equations.]

Example: Find the general and specific solutions to x'' = t e^t given x(0) = x'(0) = 0
This requires doing integration by parts, which Jason reviews.

3) Separation of Variables Solution Method (59 minutes)
The first tool in your toolkit  Separation of variables only applies to first order equations that the have form x' = f(x) g(t)

Examples in correct form: x' = (x^2) t and  x' = t^(1/2) sqrt(x)
Example not in the correct form: x' = sqrt(x^t)
Example that can be manipulated to the correct form: t^2 x'' = x  , divide both sides by t^2

Abstract statement of the method:
 dx/dt = f(x) g(t) dt
(1/f(x)) dx = g(t) dt
Integrate both sides
Try to solve for x in terms of t

Example: solve 3 (dx/dt) = 2x
Explains 2x does have pattern f(x) g(t)

[Throughout these DVDs, Jason says that he will ""raise both sides of the equation to the e-power"" when what he means is that he will ""raise e to the powers given by each side of the equation"".  He simplifies expressions like ""e^( ln (absolute value of x)) to 'x' instead of to ""absolute value of x"", without explaining why this can be done.  When we get to section 8) on graphing  the solutions to differential equations, he finally works a problem where he simplifies ""e^(ln(absolute value of x)"" to ""absolute value of x"".  Jason's definition of the absolute value function is ""plus or minus x"".]

Solve the ODE:  e^(2t) x' + e^t = 1
Points out that the dx/dt notation is the natural one to use.
Writes out in detail the integration by substitution of functions such as e^(-2t)

Solve the ODE: (x+1)(t^2 + 1) = t x'

Solve the ODE:  t^2 x' = x^2 with initial condition x(1) = 2

Disk 2

4) First Order Variation of Parameters, Part 1  (58 minutes)
He spends a few minutes explaining why he won't show a proof that the method works.

The method ""First Order Variation of Parameters"" applies to a ""first order linear differential equation"" and this equation has the form:  a_1(t) x' + a_0(t) x = E(t)

Later in the video, he calls the function E(t) ""the forcing function"".

[Jason hasn't defined what a ""linear"" differential equation is.  He makes an analogy between the form of the ""first order linear differential equation"" and the form of a 2nd degree polynomial, so the terminology ""linear"" may be confusing. (It means that all terms are linear with respect to the unknown function and it's derivatives, so there are no terms like  (x'(t))^2  or  x(t) x'(t).) ]

The steps of the method are as follows:

Step 1) Divide by a_1(t), get an equation in ""standard form""
x' + r(t) x =  q(t)  (eq. N)
Eq. N is the ""non-homogeneous"" equation.  Note this equation is not separable.

Step 2) Write the ""homogeneous equation"", eq H.
 x' + r(t) x = 0  (eq. H)
 ""you take the pure function of time and set that equal to zero""
 Eq. H is a separable ODE.

Step 3)  Solve eq. H.  The solution to step 2)  will look like  x(t) = k h(t), where k is a constant.

Step 4)  Assume solution to eq N. is  x = k(t) h(t). We now assume the parameter k varies with time,
hence the name ""variation of parameters""

Step 5) Substitute x = k(t)h(t) into eq. N.  After some simplification, this yields  k'(t)h(t) = q(t).
When you do this step, you should see some cancellation as you simplify.  If you don't, you have made an error in your previous work.

Step 6) Solve for k'(t) and integrate to get k(t)
k'(t) = integral k'(t)dx + c

Step 7) Use step 4) to find solution
x(t) = k(t) h(t)

Example: solve  3 x' + 2x = 1
While doing this, Jason explains ""the quick way"" to integrate functions like e^((2/3)t), without writing out the procedure as integration by substitution.

Solve  x' + 3x = t
As in many problems to follow, this work requires an integration by parts.

5) First Order Variation of Parameters, Part 2 (52 minutes)

One step involves finding the intergral of tan(t).  A student fresh from calculus might know this antiderivative by memory. Jason takes the trouble to derive it by integrating sin(t)/cos(t) by parts. The cancellation expected in step 5 of the method requires realizing that  cos(t) tan(t)  =  sin(t).

Example: solve x' - 2x = sin(t)

Jason takes about half an hour to explain this problem and then a few more minutes summarizing it.
One step involves finding the integral of e^(-2t) sin(t) dt. This is done by two applications of integration by parts.  In a calculus textbook, the integration would be one of the ""hard problems"" in the integration by parts exercises.  It involves what Jason calls the product of two ""indestructible  functions"".  Instead of simplifying matters, the technique at first seems to make no progress.  Jason explains the integration in detail.

Example: solve x' - tx = t given the initial condition x(0) = 1/2

Disk 3

6) Exact Differential Equations  (73 minutes)

A differential equation is an ""Exact Differential Equation"" if
M(x,t) dt + N(x,t) dx = 0  (The right hand side must be zero, otherwise it's not an ""exact"" equation.)
and there exists a function F(x,t) such that the partial derivative of F with respect to x = M(x,t)
and the partial derivative of F with respect to t = N(x,t).

If an equation, like the one above, is exact  then it can be written as
(partial derivative of F with respect to t) dt + (partial derivative of F with respect to x) dx = 0
We write this equation as  dF = 0  Where dF is the ""total differential"".

The solution to the equation is F(x,t) = c, where c is a constant.

There is a straightforward test for exactness:
The ODE is exact if and only if  (partial derivative of M with respect to x) = (partial derivative of N with respect to t)

Example: Determine if the ODE  x dt - t dx = 0 is an exact differential equation.
He explains that the problem could have been written as  dx/dt = x/t

Example: Solve  t dt + x dx = 0

It passes the test.  To find F, he begins by integrating M(x,t) with respect to t.
""Partial integration"" of a function of two variables M(x,t) with respect to t doesn't produce a ""constant of integration"".  It produces a function of g(x) that is a function of other variable.

Example: Solve  (3 t^2 sin^2 x)dt + (2t^3 sin x cos x - 2 e^(2x)) dx = 0

The computation of F should give you g'(x) = a function of x alone.  If it doesn't, you've made a mistake.  In this problem, the solution only defines x as function of t implicitly.

Example: Solve  (2x t^2 + 2x) dt + (2t x^2 + 2t) dx = 0

It fails the test for being an exact differential equation.  Jason doesn't solve it by other means.

Example:  Solve ( 2(t^3) x  - 5 x^4) (dx/dt) = -3t^2 x^2 - 1 given the initial condition x(1) = 2
It must be manipulated to be in the form of an exact equation.

7) Existence and Uniqueness Theorem  (16 minutes)

Jason writes the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for first order ODEs and explains its meaning.
He doesn't work any problems.

[ I think he should have.  He could work problems that only involve understanding whether a given function is continuous.  Jason never explains the concept of continuity in these DVDs ]

8) Graphing First Order Differential Equations  (43 minutes)

Example: Graph the solution of dx/dt = x

To check the graph he plans to do, he solves the equation by separation of variables  This time ""e^ln(absolute value of (x))"" comes out as ""absolute value of x"" instead of ""x"".  He draws a field of tangent vectors.

An isocline is a curve on the graph curve where the solutions have a constant slope.
We set dx/dt = a constant  = m to find an isocline.

[In this example we have two different solutions x(t) passing through the points where  x = 0.  It would be interesting to hear about this in relation to the ""Existence and Uniqueness Theorem"".]

Example: Graph the solutions of dx/dt = t + 1
The isoclines are vertical liness

Example: Graph the solutions of dx/dt = x^2 + t
The isoclines are sideways parabolas

9) Applications of ODE - Mixing Problems  (37 minutes)

""Mixing problems""  involve rates of flow of liquids

Example:  Water flows into a pool at 10 m^3/min and out the other end at the same rate.  The pools volume is 1000 m^3.

Initially the pool has 100 g of pollutants, and there is additional pollutants flowing into the pool at a rate of 2g/m^3.  When these new pollutants enter the pool, they mix quickly so that the concentration in the pool is uniform.

What is the formula for the number of grams of pollutant in the pool as a function of time ,x(t) ?

[ I think the problem should have said ""There is additional pollutant in the incoming water . It has a concentration of 2 g/ m^3 .""]

Example: A tank contains 100 L of water in which 20 g of salt is dissolved.  Water containing 2g/L of salt is poured into the tank at a rate of 4 L/min, and the well mixed solution flows out at the same rate from the bottom of the tank.

How much salt is in the tank after ""t"" minutes?

Disk 4

10) Newton's Law Of Cooling  (58 minutes)

Newton's Law Of Cooling:  dx/dt = - gamma (x - y)

Think of ""warm body x"" in a cooler environment.  x(t) = temperature of body of interest
y = temperature of the environment  We assume y is a constant.
Gamma is a constant of proportionality.

In words: The rate of temperature change is proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and the surroundings.

Example: A glass of water at 50F is put in a freezer and loses heat according to Newton's Law of Cooling.  The freezer is held constant at 30F.  After 1 hour the water temperature is 40F.  How long after we put the water in the freezer will it cool to 32 F?

Example: You heat water in a pan to 100C, then turn off the heat.  Some time later, your friend enters the kitchen and measures the temperature to be 80C.  10 minutes after this, the temperature is 75C.  The temperature of the kitchen is a constant 20C.  How much time elapsed between turning off the flame and your friend entering the kitchen?

11) Applications - Circuits, Part 1  (50 minutes)

He explains the diagram symbols for a resistor and an inductor.  We won't deal with capacitors here since we are only dealing with first order equations.  A capacitor would require a higher order ODE.

Example: Differential equation of a resistor, inductor and voltage source in series
i(t) = current in amps

Jason gives a version of Kirchoff's Laws for a single loop. He fails to mention any direction for traveling around the loop and he states the differential equation as:  v(t) = iR  + L di/dt instead of  v(t) + iR + L di/dt = 0.  So his interpretation of ""the voltage across the source"" is measured with a different convention that the usual statement of the law.

Example: Set up and solve the differential equation for the case: Voltage source = 12 V battery , R = 2 ohms, L = 4 henrys; Initial condition i(0) = 3
The equation is:  i R + L di/dt = v(t)  He solves it by variation of parameters.

Midway through the problem, he given an intermission on ""forcing functions""  The homogeneous equation is the ""un-forced"" response of the system.

He discusses the ""transient"" part of the solution and the ""steady state"" part of the solution.

12) Applications - Circuits, Part 2 (46 minutes)

Example:  A resistor, inductor and voltage source are in single loop.  R = 4 ohms, L = 2 henrys, v(t) = cos(3t).  Find the differential equation that applies and solve it.

4i + 2 di/dt = cos(3t)

He solves by variation of parameters.  This involves another example of using integration by parts on a product of ""indestructible functions"".  He takes about 26 minutes to demonstrate how to do this integration.",1283040000,18,17094,4.524918032786886
