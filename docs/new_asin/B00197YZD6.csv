He cried,shed tears, talking about his family, talking about his upbringings, talked about how he got in the GAME! I had 2nd doubts whilst watching, but soon was brought back to reality... he started getting on Curtis Jackson! It just sucks, cause I thought this was going to be an updated movie of his upcoming video single that I happen to see on youtube with him of his dyed red woodpecker mohawk hair. But in all, it was a good documentary of The Game and his upbringing, it never talked about his brother's beef with him, Dre responding to his weeping from his 2nd album. But it I enjoyed it tho, if u seen Stop Snitching, u will get used to seeing his moms, but u will get a chance to see his dad and what he(GAME) did and how he really got shot and just to let u know, all his old homies are not anywhere in this DVD from his prior ones.",1306627200,2,979,4.240641711229946
