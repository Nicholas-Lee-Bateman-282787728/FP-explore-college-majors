8266956,4,B0017R1E3C,I learned a lot watching this video. There are some fresh moves that are presented in an easy-to-learn format. Best for intermediate level pole dancers.,1368403200,,152,5.12
8266957,3,B0017R1E3C,"This DVD shows a few cool moves, but otherwise I found that it showed more exotic dance moves with the pole then learning how to use the pole. After each move the instructor looked at the camera like she was performing in an adult industry movie. I was really dissatified overall. If you're just starting out, this DVD isn't the one to buy.
On a good note,I purchased another pole dancing DVD with 4 DVD's and found this one to be great. I will leave feedback for the other DVD that I purchased on that product. Please do more searching before buying this DVD, there are others out there that are much more informative and of better quality.",1346803200,,641,4.440677966101695
8266958,3,B0017R1E3C,The DVD is very informational. I do recommend this DVD to somebody how is interested in seeing how the process works.,1337558400,,117,4.619047619047619
8266959,4,B0017R1E3C,I think the dvd was a good start for someone who is just starting the pole. It teaches the beginner moves with few intermediate moves.  It use a student for some moves and the more advance ones the instructor does. But if u are looking for more advance pole dancing then this is not the dvd for u.,1242864000,3,297,4.120689655172414
8266960,3,B0017R1E3C,"Edith is not a bad instructor. However, she fails to address an important issue during her demonstrations: Safety! Pole requires muscle conditioning and proper positioning in order to avoid serious injury. The most common injuries are to the shoulder joints and she has failed to compensate for this in her instruction. I would recommend this video to individuals who are at an intermediate pole level, not for beginners who need to learn pole safety first.",1240444800,3,457,5.1066666666666665
