I actually ran around to about eight different stores looking for this movie, and no one had it - not Barnes and Noble, not Newbury Comics, not Blockbuster or Target.  Thanks for helping me out!

4462842,4,B004SIP6E0,"This is a wonderful film, about a lonely boy in post-war Sicily, who turns his early passion for movies into a career.  It is one of those films that tugs at the heart, with themes of life, love, and moving on yet keeping everything inside.  There is not a single moment in the film that doesn't ring true with the deepest emotion and yearning, all while being fun and provocative.  Even my kids enjoyed it.

The frame of the story is a reminiscence by a highly successful film maker, who learns of the death of one of his greatest friends - a friend, a father replacement, and mentor in life.  He goes back to his time as a young boy, when much of the town was war rubble.  At the center of village life was a cinema, where just about everyone went for a vicarious communal experience, vividly portrayed in the boy's observations.  The projector is run by a wonderful man, played by Noiret, who takes the boy under his wing.  Their relationship is touching, yet not at all sentimental:  the boy has to work his way in by guile, the man offers him advice in work and life, often by quoting lines from American movies, always joking yet with serious messages.  It is a perfect balance.  Of course, the boy grows up and had to go his own way, with a kick from Noiret.

This is destined to be a classic.  However, it did play a bit too long about the film experiences, I felt.  Warmly recommended.",1314230400,,1394,4.352713178294573

I felt the closing scene was very cathartic and brought a lot of emotions to the surface.  The story is about a young boy who helped his local movie theater projectionist at ""Cinema Paradiso,"" AKA the Paradise Cinema. The movies he saw inspired him to become a successful actor; He returned to his native village at attend the funeral of his mentor, the projectionist.  While back home, he also tries to find the woman with whom he fell in love as a young man, and while doing so, he also uncovered secrets from the past he didn't know about.

The acting is superb and I honestly enjoyed every second. I was laughing, crying and everything in-between. It truly shows how films can affect people in the best ways possible, to inspire love and hope! The friendship between Toto and Alfredo is so genuine and heartfelt and carries the film beautifully. The ending (for me) was full of tears and joy and tied the film up perfectly. This piece of art made me appreciate the beauty of films even more.

4462887,5,B004SIP6E0,"First, Let me state emphatically that this film MUST be seen in the extended ""New"" version. The extra footage will put some viewers off, but I insist it is absolutely necessary to understand the whole story. You must buy the Miramax edition with the blue cover, available from Amazon. Side ""A"" is the extended, 174 minute version.  Side ""B"" is the absurd shortened version.
Next it would take a far better wordsmith than me to adequately describe the raptures of this film. Everything about it is extraordinary.  It is a creation of great beauty, with marvelous performances, numerous classic film clips edited together with great artistry, and above all, breathtaking music.
For me, the film presents a profound message about the Meaning, or Nature, of Love.
That message, simply stated, is that love is a paradox that is at once enduring and momentary; enduring, because it can last a whole lifetime, and momentary because it can be over in the brief moment it takes to kiss another human being. Having been married with great mutual love for 43 years I can attest to the truth of this principle.
I must disclose that every time I reach the end of this film and see the famous closing montage of classic film clips presented over the music of the breathtaking Love Theme, it makes me weep openly. I guess I am just an old Romantic.
Please, I implore you, watch this wonderful first while you are alone, and then again, with someone you love.",1376870400,2,1443,4.722222222222222

4462890,5,B004SIP6E0,"This is a movie-lover's movie.  I grew up in a small Mid-west town with one movie theater.  We got some of the movies almost a year after their original release. A cross-section of our town went regularly and it was a social event. Watching this movie reminded me of many nights in our theater. Lots of personalities, we often had the same reaction, laughing, crying etc.  In the movie the theater was a gathering point for the diverse personalities of the town.  The relationship between the projectionist and the young boy was very touching.  As the boy grew to a man, he continued to love his mentor.  The final scene viewing all of the scenes that the town priest had banned was wonderful and very emotional.  The music was great. The casting and acting made the film fun to watch and it was easy to become emotionally invested. I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. I wanted to share this experience with her.",1374105600,5,923,4.524096385542169
4462891,5,B004SIP6E0,"One of the finest films about the enduring love, and need, for cinema, `Cinema Paradiso' is a film about loving movies that makes me love movies!  There are few films that can capture every element of nostalgic euphoria while adding layers of emotional relevance, and this is one that nails both aspects in a beautifully balanced film that stands the tests of time and singlehandedly preserves the absolute need for cinema in our lives.

Giuseppe Tornatore's film follows young Toto as he grows into a man in wartime Italy.  He strikes up a friendship with Alfredo, the town projectionist.  Toto loves film, and more than that he loves the cinema (they are two separate entities linked together by a common thread) and so after much persuasion and plenty of headaches, Toto convinces Alfredo to teach him the ropes of showing films.  As Toto falls further in love with the world depicted on the screen in front of him, his own life begins to mirror that which he sees on screen.  His life moves on, obviously, and yet his love for film and the effect that it has had on his life (including the memory of Alfredo) never leaves him.

Tornatore magically weaves a fully fleshed out story that feels so complete and relatable.  He finds a way to make Toto's unique childhood feel warm and inviting and, most importantly, relatable.  We can feel the same joys that Toto feels as he allows the warmth of film to fill his soul, and as he ages, loves, loses and moves on we can feel the nostalgic emotional connection to the life he left behind and the memories that he holds so dear.

Philippe Noiret delivers one of the finest performances put to film as the paternal Alfredo.  He grounds the film, giving a moral backdrop and serving a key purpose in the film's storytelling.  As young Toto grows into a man, he never forgets the impact that Alfredo had on him, and it is only strengthened for the viewer thanks to Noiret's graceful delivery and his earthy tone.  He comforts the film, if that makes sense, holding it close enough to validate Toto's admiration and our endearment.

From the stunning sets to the beautiful way the film is shot, and that devastating score, `Cinema Paradiso' is the definition of perfection, a film that loves movies and highlights the very reasons why we do too!",1373587200,6,2289,4.661691542288557
4462892,3,B004SIP6E0,"UPDATE: When I first saw this movie, there were no sex scenes in it.(released in 1989-I think)
I wrote the following review based on THAT particular edition-not the ""extended cut"" or updated,
or the NEW CINEMA PARADISO.......I refrain from endorsing something that is not family oriented.
There are explicit sex scenes in the New Cinema Paradiso. With this in mind, I recommend thinking
twice about about showing this to younger children.

Having said that, here is the review on the ""regular"" version.....

A cute little boy turns into a young man. Set during the 2nd world war,
this little boy loses his father, but as they say, God opens a window(maybe)....

The older man who runs the projector at the local town's cinema, becomes a father
figure to this little boy (and subsequent, the blossoming young man) and teaches him to run
the projector-against his widowed mother's wishes.

Then the young man finds a sweetheart and they fall in love, but the father of the girl intervenes.

Some things are predictable, but the sentimentality is so wonderful, so mooshie(is that a real word?)
I HAD to own this DVD. It touched my heart SO MUCH! (the original release......).

This was the first movie I was able to watch, after taking a  Modern Italian conversational class, and not
read or depend on the subtitles. SO FUN. A nice memory for me, and hopefully you will make a nice
memory with this movie. The characters in the movie certainly did!

The piazza scene was filmed on the island of Sicily. So beautiful!

This is a three hanky movie/love story all based in Italia. Enjoy the drama,(not a ton but some) the sorrow, and the wonderful ending! Winner of Canne Film festival in (1988 or 1989?)....Some characters are absolutely unforgettable!!! I laughed and cried!",1373414400,3,1770,4.853820598006645

However the acting is generally overwrought and the film is a series of manipulative vignettes more than a coherent story. The love story comes in late and without much chemistry, so if you're expecting a romance you will be disappointed.

Overall the story was interesting (I especially liked the anecdote about the soldier who fell in love with the King's daughter) and had a heartbreaking quality. But it also feels dated and ponderous.

The story of love is crafted in such a romantic and beautiful way; the relationship and friendship between Toto (the boy) and Alfredo (the theater projectionist) is wonderful, nostalgic, and full of enriching life lessons; the fictional town of Giancaldo is truly magical thanks to the diversity of its characters and the charming square and colorful buildings; and the music by Enio Morricone is absolutely emotional and powerful. Especially the love theme composed by his son Andrea Morricone. I am almost 40 now and have watched this film so many times. And every time my tears blur the final scene. What a beautiful movie!",1484524800,,796,4.77536231884058

8439785,5,B004SIP6E0,"This is a must see and a very important film to watch. A must have for any video library. I have seen it many times and every time I have see it it has taken me away from this world and catapulted into Toto's world. There are two versions of this movie. One is the directors cut, and one is the regular version. If you want to know what really happened to the main characters in the movie and seeing it in view of the directors eyes, get the long version. I preferred the cinema version and felt strangely sobered up watching the directors cut.",1437177600,3,544,4.190476190476191
