2677629,5,B000JLTREK,"An excellent film. Very little known until now but, I would say, is one of the best films in its genre. Simmons is a perfect femme fatale here. It is also a film full of misogynist quips: ""The only bad thing about America is that women get spoiled""; or ""...even a woman can do it"". Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun for your feminist friends.

It's a fine movie to watch, easy to follow plot, no complications, it's fast. goes to the point and it's a thriller; in only 90 minutes approx; it goes in a blink of an eye. I wish they made all like this one.

The end is one of a kind, don't miss it.",1171238400,,594,3.941666666666667
2677630,5,B000JLTREK,"It was poetic justice for the master of moral ambiguity in filmmaking, Otto Preminger, to journey from home studio Twentieth-Century Fox to direct a film noir drama.  It was also fitting that the film's male star was the somber master of noir leading men, Robert Mitchum, but that was not the initial intention.

Otto Preminger's ideal symbol for his moral ambiguity-tinged dramas was Dana Andrews, who starred under Preminger at Fox in classic noirs ""Laura"" and ""Fallen Angel,"" but he was busy at the time.  It was only natural, therefore, for Mitchum to then assume the lead at his home studio.  The cinematographer who provided those brilliant, appropriately shadowy black and white noir hues was the veteran, England-born Harry Stradling, who was on loan out from Samuel Goldwyn Studios.

This 1953 release was unsuccessful on its initial run.  This is typical of so many of the great noir films of the forties and fifties, many of which are now celebrated as classics as the genre receives current deserved recognition and accompanying plaudits.

One of Mitchum's towering film monuments came at RKO in the 1947 gem ""Out of the Past,"" but it also had trouble gaining traction initially with the public, but has gone on to earn deserved classic status.  That great film can be used as an instructive comparison to ""Angel Face"" to create an important distinction.

In ""Out of the Past"" Mitchum is confronted with femme fatale Jane Greer, who lights up the screen with her pure explosiveness.  Mitchum, despite his persona as a shrewd and streetwise detective, is unable to let go of the potent handful of TNT he is irresistibly drawn to in the form of Greer.  The ever-shrewd Greer knows this and plays Mitchum like a Wurlitzer.  He is aware of this and still comes back for more, unable to shake her.

This femme fatale model is a familiar one and is exemplified as well by Barbara Stanwyck and Claire Trevor in ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Murder, My Sweet"" respectively.  Better than a generation Kathleen Turner would carve out a similar niche in ""Body Heat.""

Master of moral ambiguity Preminger shrewdly presents a deadly but different style of femme fatale in Britisher Jean Simmons.  Elegant and soft-spoken, Simmons presents the image of ""soft sell femme fatale.""  Her IQ for man trapping and manipulation, however, is at the same genius level as Greer, Stanwyck, Trevor and Turner.

Mitchum shows up at the mansion where Simmons resides with her author father, played by veteran British leading man Herbert Marshall, and the rich woman who has been keeping both of them.  She is soft-spoken and superficially harmless, even seemingly angelic as the title informs us, ""Angel Face.""

Before Mitchum knows it he has been diverted away from the uncomplicated nice girl he has been dating, Mona Freeman, and is squarely in Simmons' headlights.  Before long puppet master-femme fatale Simmons has induced burly but helpless Mitchum to quit his job as an ambulance driver and assume a job as chauffeur.  She even promises to help grub stake him to launch his own garage business.

What makes Simmons so convincing and such a unique femme fatale is that not only can she appear angelic; the most frightening events containing shattering magnitude can be carried out with her exuding a detached and relaxed nonchalance.  The moral ambiguity emphasized by Preminger has found the perfect communicator in Jean Simmons.

The harder that Mitchum tries to pull away after realizing that a tiger has him by the tail, the more determined and formidable Simmons becomes.  Events build to a dramatic climax with an unforgettable twist ending.",1170547200,4,3632,5.001663893510815

2677632,4,B000JLTREK,"A fascinating melodrama, directed by Otto Preminger in a noir-ish mood, with one of the all time great shock finales. None of the characters in it are particularly likeable, so it makes for a rather cold dish in my opinion. The main flaw in this production is that the two leads, played by Jean Simmons and Robert Mitchum - both fine actors - have absolutely no chemistry together on the screen. Jean Simmons's character is cool, enigmatic, and calculating. She's wonderful here and, of course, very beautiful. (The costume people did her no favors by saddling her with ugly black wigs and those pointy, shield-like bras.) The problem is Robert Mitchum. (And I love Robert Mitchum!) The whole story hinges on him falling for Simmons in a big way and consequently acting against his better judgement, with fatal results. But here he seems to be sleepwalking through the part.  They don't even seem to like each other, let alone have a grand passion. That's a serious drawback in a story like this! Think of the sparks that fly between Mitchum and Jane Greer in ""Out of the Past"" or between John Garfield and Lana Turner in ""Postman Always Rings Twice,"" and then watch Mitchum and Simmons.

2677645,2,B000JLTREK,"""Angel Face"" is a 1952 black and white melodrama from Otto Preminger with Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons.

The film is often mis-labeled ""film noir"". Classic film noir has certain conventions, the major ones being a femme fatale, double and triple crosses, a protagonist (often a cop or detective) who with a single error of judgment sets the motion in action, a cast of seedy characters, and lots of night and/or rain sequences. This film has only one of these conventions - the femme fatale, played very well by sexy and beautiful Jean Simmons (1929-2010). But otherwise, this is merely a melodrama, and a poor one at that.

The reason for mistaking the film for ""noir"" may be that it contains film noir alumni like Robert Mitchum and Otto Preminger. Robert Mitchum (1917-97) received his only Oscar nomination for ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum's work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962) is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time. I liked him best as the drunken sheriff in ""El Dorado"" (1966). In the 40s and 50s he was the ""king"" of film noir with films like ""When Strangers Marry"" (1944), ""The Locket"" (1946), ""Pursued"" (1947), ""Out of the Past"" (1947), etc.

Otto Preminger(1905-86)  made 41 films and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Laura"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""The Cardinal"") and a Palme d'Or 3 times (""Carmen Jones"", ""Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon"", ""Advise and Consent""). His film noir include ""Laura"" (1944), ""Fallen Angel"" (1945), ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" (1950), and ""The Thirteenth Letter"" (1951).

FWIW - Preminger didn't like the script and refused to make the film, but was finally persuaded by Howard Hughes who gave him carte blanche as long as he required Simmons to wear a black wig - apparently the result of a tiff between Hughes and Simmons. The acrimony spilled over and Preminger ended up being slapped in the face by both Simmons and Mitchum.

Putting aside the film noir issue, the film is fairly predictable, and the ending is not very satisfactory. These problems are off set by good acting from Mitchum and Simmons and from a beautiful score by Dimitri Tiomkin (1894-1979). Tiomkin won 3 Oscars (""The High and the Mighty"", ""High Noon"", ""The Old Man and the Sea"") (1954), and was nominated for 14 more.

Also look for Herbert Marshall as Simmon's father and Jim Backus (Mr. McGoo) as a district attorney.

The NY Times called it ""an exasperating blend of genuine talent, occasional perceptiveness and turgid psychological claptrap"" and the ""taut story idea have been set adrift in a pretentious Freudian mist that wafts through the handsomely mounted proceedings with disastrous results.""

The top grossing films in 1952 were ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", ""Ivanhoe"", and ""Singing in the Rain"".  ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" won for Best Picture and other Oscar winners were ""High Noon"" (Actor), ""The Quiet Man"" (Director), ""Come Back Little Sheeba"" (Actress), and ""Viva Zapata"" (Supporting Actor).

Bottom line - Good acting and an excellent score can't compensate for a poor script.",1323216000,6,3288,4.9169675090252705
2677646,4,B000JLTREK,"Some guys never learn, never learn to leave well enough alone, and stay away, far away from femme fatales that have that slightly mad look in their eyes and lust in their hearts, as here in the Otto Preminger-directed crime noir, Angel Face, with Robert Mitchum. See, it is not like Brother Robert hadn't been down that road before and had all the trouble he could handle and then some with femme fatale Jane Greer in Out Of The Past. Ms. Greer ""took him for a ride"" six ways to Sunday in that one. But you know when a guy gets heated up by a  dame, well, lets' just leave it at you know, okay. Needless to say Brother Robert is set to get ""taken for a ride"" six ways to Sunday here too, although the femme fatale here is a little younger, and maybe has better manners. Maybe. But that all goes for naught when the heat rises. Yes, we know, we know.

The plot here takes a little something from James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. The ""fair damsel"" (played by a young dark-eyed, dark-haired piano-playing Jean Simmons who, before seeing this film might have taken a run at her myself, in my dreams. But see I know how to take a lesson), after she gets her hooks into Mitchum, furthers her plot to get rid of her dear stepmother so she can have her father to herself (take that anyway you want but you do not have to be a Freudian to know that she is seriously hung up on her novelist father, a probable cause for some of her youthful, ah, monomania). But unlike the femme in Postman she just ""forgets"" to tell him he is part of the plan. Of course when the foul deed is done (the old ""wire cut on the steering wheel of the car and off the cliff you go, dearie"" gag that has been around, well, been around since femmes figured out automobiles aren't just for driving) the pair are the obvious suspects. But with some razzle-dazzle legal work, including marriage to evoke the jury's sympathy they get off.  Ya, I know on that one too. But those were more romantic times than ours, I guess. I want the name and e-mail of that lawyer, by the way, just in case.) Of course what guy in his right mind is going to stick around and see, well, what is in store for him and his lovely bride after the court battles are over? Like I said though, this is Robert Mitchum, the guy who can't learn a lesson.

Note:  Naturally with a hunky guy like Robert Mitchum, he of the broad shoulder to fend off the world's troubles, or at least any women's troubles, those smoldering eyes, and that glib world-wary cigarette and whiskey manner, the ladies will surely be flocking to his door.  And not just femme fatales. In this film, as in Out Of The Past, there is the ""good"" girl waiting in wings. And Mitchum tries, tries, like hell to stay in that orbit but when those maddened eyes and ruby red lips call that speak to some dark adventure, well what's a man to do?",1316736000,,2858,4.273567467652495

2677648,4,B000JLTREK,"This is a review for ANGEL FACE (1952) directed by Otto Preminger.
Robert  Mitchum,  as Frank Jessup, in a role where it's hard to determine whether he's the fall guy or hero.  The truth is he's the protagonist in this noir mystery really starring Jean Simmons as Dianne Tremayne,a potential heiress- daughter who enlists Frank Jessup's help in protecting her parents by hiring him as a chauffer.

After a while Frank realizes that Dianne is the schemer and he's just as enmeshed in her trap as her helpless parents. But is there a way out, especially after Dianne's parents die in a suspicious auto crash. ANGEL FACE, like most of Otto Preminger's films,  is a very well done entertainment and could keep you guessing right up to the rather abrupt ending.

A well done Parmount Pictures film with all the accesories you could expect from a major studio release in the early fifties. Suspenseful and mysterious,
should keep you on the edge of your seat.  Four Stars.",1286582400,2,966,4.748502994011976
2677649,2,B000JLTREK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Speaking during the special features DVD commentary, noted film noir 'expert', Eddie Muller, concedes that when he first watched 'Angel Face', he had a nagging feeling ""underneath"" it all, that this was a film that was ""fairly minor and somewhat unexceptional"". Somehow Mr. Muller's gut feelings were subsumed by other factors. Undoubtedly he was swayed by famed New Wave Director Godard placing the film on his top ten list of the sound era, a fact which he happens to mention during the DVD commentary. But beyond that Muller seems to be most impressed by Director Otto Preminger's ""efficiency"" in telling his story. Perhaps we were both watching a different movie because if anything, it's precisely the inefficiency of the storytelling that relegates it to the ""B"" list of mediocre noirs, despite the ""A"" list cast!

  As Muller informs us, when Angel Face was first released, it was not a box office success. Critics rightly pointed out that it suffered from a slow-moving narrative and certainly this is true up until the midpoint, when Diana, the film's femme fatale (servicably played by Jean Simmons) murders her father and step-mother. The beginning of the film starts off with a bang, as paramedic Frank Jessup (Robert Mitchum) races to the upper-class Tremayne household where he and his partner find that Diana's stepmother, Catherine, has been almost asphyxiated by gas. Soon, Diana takes an obsessive interest in Frank and she even tries to ruin his relationship with current girlfriend Mary Wilton by meeting with her for lunch and telling her that she had a date with Frank. Diana's parents and their Japanese servants also prove to be interesting characters but are never developed (the father is a 'famous novelist' who now has writer's block and the stepmother enjoys weekly bridge games).

  The story soon becomes lethargic and predictable as the focus is mainly on Diana's obsession. Like many of these femme fatale characters, the obsession is usually a 'given' and in this case Diana appears to have a thing for her father which causes her to hate the stepmother (she mainly blames the stepmother for causing Daddy's writer's block). There are just too many repetitious talky scenes where Diana meets with Frank as she tries to ensnare him. When Frank finally agrees to take the chauffeur job at the Tremayne's, with the hope that his sports car shop will be bankrolled, the hard-boiled Mitchum seems miscast as a chump who's willing to go against 'his better judgment' in hooking up with nut job Diana. While the manner in which Diana kills her parents is certainly quite cinematic (with the family car dramatically going over the cliff), it's all rather predictable stuff. In a bit of over dramatic foreshadowing, Preminger has Diana watch as she flips a cigarette box over the cliff shortly before the murder . What's more, Frank recognizes that Diana is obsessed and correctly predicts that she intends to murder her stepmother--this propels him to tell Diana that's he's leaving.

  I also had a hard time believing that Diana wouldn't account for her father's whereabouts before she fixes the car so it'll drive in reverse. After all, the whole idea is to finish off the stepmother so she can have her father all for herself.

  Ironically, the courtroom scene is finally a welcome relief after all the prior stodgy, dialogue-laden scenes before the murder. With the help of an excellent Leon Ames as Diana's slick attorney and some good cross-cutting cinematography, the courtroom drama doesn't seems as 'talky' as all the stuff prior to the midpoint. That's probably because we've become tired of Diana's histrionics and since she remains in the background during the trial, the ""B"" players take over and provide us with a refreshing change of pace.

  Since this is 1952, during the height of the Hollywood 'decency' code, a murderer must get his/her just desserts (and Diana's seeming remorse is not enough to save her!) . Since Frank lied to the police about his knowledge of Diana's state of mind, he too must be punished. The ending of Angel Face is disappointing as we see it coming from the get go. We know that Diana is going to bump off Frank since he rejects her but we don't know exactly how. So when it turns out, it's another 'over the cliff with the car' job, the sense of deja vu leads us to exclaim, 'been there, done that!'

  The problem with the entire femme fatale storyline is that by 1952 it's been done so many times before that the screenwriters needed a new angle to keep the audience's interest. But there are no surprises here in Jean Simmon's one-note portrayal of the demented socialite. The fault is not entirely with the actress since the part in itself lends itself to one-note overacting.

  Finally, despite being miscast in Angel Face, it's comforting to know that Robert Mitchum wasn't such a milquetoast in real life. According to Mr. Muller, after Otto Preminger insisted that Mitchum slap Simmons multiple times during rehearsal, Mr. Mitchum turned around and slapped Preminger in the face and asked, ""is this the way you want it done?"" Mitchum objected to Preminger treating women the way he did and Preminger then stalked off the set, insisting that Mitchum be fired. Preminger was unsuccessful in his demand and Mitchum continued to live up to his reputation as a chivalrous tough guy knight in shining armor.",1271548800,4,5428,4.920043811610077
2677650,4,B000JLTREK,"All the elements are in place here in this 1952 Ottto Preminger RKO film what could be a very typical noir melodrama: a nonchalant, tough-guy hero looking out for pretty much for himself (Robert Mitchum); a spoiled murderous beautiful rich girl (Jean Simmons) who falls for him, and who adores her father (Herbert Marshall) and loathes her wealthy stepmother (Barbara O'Neil); the hero's smart, hardworking previous girlfriend (Mona Freeman), a ""nice girl"" who can easily read the spoiled rich girl's manipulative motives for what they are. But if you think you know where the plot is going, think again: the screenwriters, Frank S. Nugent and Oscar Millard, were determined to surprise you. The usual existential ethos of hardboiled noir here is thrown into full reverse here; the screenplay questions whether its really enough just to keep yourself free and clear of other people's corruption, and suggests that such a position might even be more monstrous and cold-blooded, morally, than even premeditated murder. The direction and cinematography, disappointingly, are not quite up to the level of the writing; though the interiors of the Tremayne mansion (where most of the film takes place) are unusually bright and airy, they don't seem as richly textured as the film deserves. Mitchum plays his usual role here superbly--he's so cool about everything that even a violent double murder can't make him blink--and although Simmons is not up to the truly bravura performance her role requires, she is still quite good; her unflattering hairstyle unfortunately makes her look like Jennifer Connolly. Perhaps the best performance is O'Neil as the intelligent and complex stepmother. This is a film probably every fan of noir should see just to have his or her expectations shook up, and to see the usual noir ethos of self-preservation and apathy questioned for once.",1266105600,,1868,5.209302325581396
2677651,4,B000JLTREK,"I'm no huge film noir fan but get a kick out of Hollywood's idea of nasty characters up to no good, circa 1950. This Otto Preminger project (produced by Howard Hughes) is as good as they come, with a smoldering Jean Simmons ensnaring an equally smoldering Robert Mitchum in a scheme to do away with her wealthy step-mother. When all is said and done, a lot more gets done away with than anybody bargains for. The script (after numerous rewrites, including an uncredited one by Ben Hecht) has enough clever turns and salty dialogue, even while it stretches credulity, but the relationship between a conniving young woman and her chump of a chauffeur boyfriend is more than plausible in its portrayal of class differences. Mitchum's laid-back self-confidence as he tries to manipulate two girlfriends simultaneously is outdone only by Simmons' double-dealing scheming.

Also in the cast are Leon Ames (as her slick lawyer), Herbert Marshall (as her father), and Jim Backus as a prosecuting attorney. Dimitri Tiomkin has written a fine score, with a haunting piano composition that portrays the troubled and restless spirit of our dark femme fatale. The DVD has a wonderful commentary by film historian Eddie Muller, whose enthusiasm can sound sometimes like the guys on ""Car Talk,"" which is appropriate for a storyline that involves cars and a discussion of  how to disable an automatic transmission.",1248134400,2,1398,5.073913043478261
2677652,2,B000JLTREK,"The movie plunged into its plot way to soon before I got to decide which character is to like or to hate, or even if I'm interested in them. There was an unusual plot twist at the one-hour mark, not very believable (at least by today's standards) but I suppose one would be capable of doing anything when their neck is so close to a noose, I'll suspend belief and just go with the flow...however...

The trial is pretty ridiculous. Double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial if the previous trial was a product of fraud or under false pretenses. And in what court can a juror ask a question in the middle of a trial?? When cant a lawyer ask the relationship of a witness to any of the parties involved? And why would Mitchum's charatcer (who is a pretty wise, mature, calm headed, AND skeptical guy) trust an unstable 20yr old in the first place?

Its noir but not very good noir; and not terribly entertaining either. I felt a bit suckered by my interest in noir and the fact it had Mitchum in it. This movie is liken to a made for tv movie on lifetime, the actors couldn't validate the stereotypical characters through their acting (and forced plot).

Notes: Jean Simmons looks a bit at times like Audrey Hepburn. Mitchum was a guy waaaay to cool feel as if he is being framed. As for the femme fatale, I wasn't really sure if it was real remorse or her still scheming (not the good kind of ambiguity). Not enough emotional content to make story believable.

There is a reason they don't show this movie on TCM and AMC (not with regularity atleast)....I named several them above.",1244073600,3,1584,4.43298969072165

Jean Simmons plays a young woman who is totally spoiled & hates her step-mother, who has all the money & controls it also. Her father has no money of his own so everything he gives her the stepmother pays for.

She desides to kill her step-mother so that the money will all belong to her father. From that point on everything goes down hill until the great ending.",1201305600,,589,3.8595041322314048
2677655,5,B000JLTREK,"Conceived simply as an instrument of Howard Hughes' revenge, ""Angel Face""'s perverse production history and mundane plotting yielded a disquieting cult classic in the deft hands of director Otto Preminger. Actress Jean Simmons had successfully sued Hughes to get out of a 7-year contract but still owed RKO a movie. Not one to let bygones be bygones, Hughes pulled an unexceptional script out of the vaults and plied Preminger to direct, promising him full creative control. It was the sort of ""murder drama"" that we now call ""film noir"", already rapidly losing appeal in the early 1950s. Preminger's rewrites, a low budget, 18 shooting days, a mission to make life miserable for Jean Simmons, and bodily conflict between Preminger and star Robert Mitchum produced a film that is not especially memorable for its story but whose eerie, disturbing undertones make it unforgettable.

Ambulance driver Frank Jessup (Robert Mitchum) is called to the Tremayne mansion when Catherine Tremayne (Barbara O'Neil) nearly asphyxiates from a gas leak in her bedroom. Her husband Charles (Hebert Marshall) and police speculate on how the accident may have occurred, but Catherine believes that someone tried to kill her. After a brief flirtation with Catherine's oddly unstable stepdaughter Diane (Jean Simmons), Frank heads back to the station. Diane impulsively follows, easily convincing Frank to beg off his evening with girlfriend Mary (Mona Freeman). Frank sees a lot of Diane, an idle, rich young woman who idolizes her doting novelist father and jealously despises her stepmother. She gets Frank a job as Tremayne family chauffeur. She connives to come between him and Mary. She lies. She dramatizes. Frank sees through her. But, intrigued by Diane's' lifestyle and flattered by her neediness, he goes along anyway.

Maybe the on-set strife and cruelty informed ""Angel Face""'s perverse psychology. Neither profound nor clever, Diane's clumsy machinations and Frank's submission pack an emotional wallop. Diane is trouble all right, but not a classic noir femme fatale. Her motives are entirely emotional -insecurity, instability, infatuation. Her scheming is childish and transparent. Frank Jessup, very much in noir protagonist form, is foolish enough to entangle himself in it. The film is elevated by careful, though certainly cliched, writing of the supporting characters, who provide the circumstances from which Frank and Diane's self-destruction emerges: Diane's burned-out, free-spending father and indulgent stepmother. Frank's pragmatic, hard-working girlfriend. Diane barely in control of her devastating behavior and Frank thoroughly in control to no avail make a lasting impression.

The DVD (Warner 2007): There is a nice audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller, who obviously admires the film. He discusses themes, Robert Mitchum's noir archetypes, the film's structure, refutes the idea of the femme fatale as a reaction to post-war working women, and provides a lot of background information on the motives, rewrites, and conflict behind ""Angel Face"". Subtitles for the film are available in English. Dubbing is available in French.",1186185600,9,3157,5.518595041322314

It was really wonderful. I enjoyed the whole cast and I agree that Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons were perfect in these roles. While her deadly deed plays out, she sits there emotionless with cold eyes and porcelain beauty. It was somewhat chilly. Simmons usually played the sweet wife or love roles in movies. I loved seeing her in a completely different role. I definitely recommend this movie. And what a surprise ending! OMG!",1179187200,2,584,4.735294117647059
2677658,5,B000JLTREK,"Angel Face was directed in 1952 by: Otto Preminger (Laura, 1944; Anatomy Of A Murder, 1959). Otto Preminger's `Laura' is now rightly regarded as one of great film noir masterpieces, however he made some less appreciated noirs like Fallen Angel (1945); Whirlpool (1949); Where The Sidewalk Ends (1950) and this film Angel Face. Upon it's release critics and public alike had seen perhaps far too many of this type of film hence the negative reviews. However I feel that this film is deserving of some rehabilitation. The theme is a familiar one of the Femme Fatale attempting to get some chump to assist in a murder. Angel Face is slightly different in that the Femme Fatale's (performed by Jean Simmons (Great Expectations, 1946; Hamlet, 1948; The Black Narcissus, 1947)) motivation is not the standard killing for money but for love. This makes it similar to the Ellen Berent character played by Gene Tierney in `Leave Her To Heaven' (1946, John M. Stahl). Generally in noir's guys kill for the girl and girls for the money. Robert Mitchum (Out Of The Past, 1947; Crossfire, 1947; Night Of The Hunter, 1955) gives a wonderful performance of a guy who is not so stupid as to get suck into her trap. He also has some great dialogue that one wish's they could always have at hand to deliver in those situations. Along with Humphrey Bogart and Burt Lancaster, Mitchum has to rank as one of the great noir actors. Cinematography was by Harry Stradling (A Streetcar Named Desire, 1951; Johnny Guitar, 1954; A Face In The Crowd, 1957)

This DVD comes with a wonderful audio commentary by Eddie Muller and is well worth a listen. In 1964 Jean-Luc Godard placed this film at no. 8 in his list of the greatest American films of the sound era. That alone should be good enough reason to investigate this film. It also has one of the great endings.",1176076800,17,1837,4.687306501547988
2677659,5,B000JLTREK,"The title of this piece is a paraphrase of an observation offered by the man on the commentary track.  This is an RKO picture, a Howard Hughes production--there are details about that statement that make the commentary track well worth hearing.  It stars Robert Mitchum.  I had never quite formulated that particular thought, but having heard it, I immediately realized it was perfectly true: Robert Mitchum WAS the coolest guy in America.

He was so cool that on screen he could act like a perfect chump from first frame to last and still seem cool.  He was so cool that in an America where Lucy and Ricky could not share a bed, he could get busted for possession of marijuana, take all the heat and all the publicity without whimper or complaint, then go right on being as big a movie star as ever, and still the coolest guy in sight.

The previous Amazon reviews have been impressively sound in describing this picture.  I have nothing to add beyond endorsing their high ratings. This is an unpretentious little noirish film.  It boasts a fine cast from Jean Simmons in an uncharacteristic role, to Herbert Marshall in a characteristic one, to Kenneth Tobey and Mona Freeman in fine supporting performances.  Otto Preminger was a wonderfully skilled (if wholly obnoxious) director.  This movie works, satisfying in ways that some more famous films do not.

This DVD of ""Angel Face"" offers a good film, a good print and not much in the way of bells and whistles beyond a useful (for once) commentary.  You won't go wrong with it.

Five appropriately cool stars.",1175558400,3,1563,4.7444444444444445
2677660,5,B000JLTREK,"Ambulance driver Frank Jessup (Robert Mitchum) who aspires to own a high-performance car garage meets beautiful antisocial femme fatale Diane Tremayne (Jean Simons) in the house of questionable suicide-attempt victim Catherine Tremayne (Barbara O'Neil). Diane's relentless pursuit of Frank leads to spellbinding danger for anyone coming between her and her obsessive emotional attachments.

Mitchum is great in every film I've seen. In ANGEL FACE he plays the level-headed voice of reason battling an emotional vortex of compulsive admiration. Baring a strong resemblance to Audrey Hepburn, Jene Simmons has a slight stature and attractive girl-next-door appearance. This made me quite unprepared for the diabolical plotting and tormented conscience she so artfully portrayed. She crys; she lies; she is cold, calculated, and dangerous. With so many facets of her personality, you don't know what to expect when coming face to face with her. I first saw Simmons in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ELMER-GANTRY/dp/B000056HEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ELMER GANTRY</a>&nbsp;(1960) as a Bible thumping revivalist. Based on the title, her 1952 role is perhaps an appropriate prelude to that later role. You will think twice before trusting another beauty after ANGEL FACE -- highly recommended!

8152058,3,B000JLTREK,"Review for Angel Face
Hot Toasty Rag, July 23, 2017

Despite the presence of two attractive people on the screen, Angel Face doesnt quite make it to the upper echelon of film noir classics. Jean Simmons even dons the same hairstyle that Barbara Stanwyck wore in Double Indemnity, but her chemistry with Robert Mitchum fizzled rather than sparked. Usually, I like his blas charm, but in this movie, he obviously phoned in his performance.

Like many film noirs, an innocent man is drawn into the deceitful world of a beautiful woman, led astray by his, well, powerful attraction to her. Jean Simmons certainly is beautiful, and the script is smart and snappy, but the scenes with the two leads feel a little lackluster. The best part of the movie is Robert Mitchums girlfriend Mona Freeman. Shes sassy and strong, and pretty much everything out her mouth makes you cheer and root for her.

Rounding out the cast is Herbert Marshall, Jim Backus, Barbara ONeil and Leon Ames. If you like this genre, give Angel Face a try, but it probably won't end up being your favorite. Youll come out of it a Mona Freeman fan, though!",1500768000,,1118,4.6938775510204085
