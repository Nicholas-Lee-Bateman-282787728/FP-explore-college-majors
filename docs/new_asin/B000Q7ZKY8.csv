2833953,3,B000Q7ZKY8,"I was a little disappointed with this DVD mainly because you can't select each individual episode.
The episodes just run straight through as part of a presentation that Bob and Larry do.  It doesn't give you the option to select an episode.
(Although, you could easily just do the chapter selection, also note the episodes don't go in same order as listed in the description so you'd have to be careful which chapter you're selecting.)
Not a big deal, just not what I expected.

I also didn't think the short episodes were as cute as the movies they've done.  I bought this DVD because I wanted the Snoodles Tale for my kids, but I'm sure they will like the other episodes too and you can never go wrong with the morals taught in the videos.

I'd recommend this product, just wanted to let you know a little more about the DVD.",1230336000,26,827,4.456953642384106
2833954,5,B000Q7ZKY8,"My 22 month old son adores the Veggie Tales.  This DVD is one that captivates him especially.  And it brings tears to my eyes as well.  We are not devoutly religious, but the values in these stories are just  fundamental to human kindness.",1222732800,15,239,4.488372093023256
2833955,5,B000Q7ZKY8,"This arrived (like all of the other Veggie Tale DVDs) in perfect condition, and my granddaughter is getting hours of enjoyment out of it.",1221782400,,137,4.75
2833956,4,B000Q7ZKY8,"My son's favorite part of this DVD is the theme song.  He sings it non-stop.
He also seems engaged with the other songs on the DVD.  My personal favorite is the Belly Button song, which is cute parody of an N'Sync-type boy band video.
I think he's still too young to understand a lot of the religious aspects of the stories, but (despite the title) it really isn't overtly religious or preachy.  The first story on the DVD is loosely based on the story of David and Goliath, but the biblical aspects are actually pretty subtle.  It's really more about the fact that ""little people can do big things."" And, for the limited time that I give him to watch TV, I'm much happier having him watch DVDs with a positive/educational message than exposing him to some of the ""kids"" programming and commercials (training him to be a little consumer...ugh) on TV.
As an adult, I'm actually kind of surprised at how entertaining this DVD is for me.  And the Snoodle story towards the end of the video really did touch my heart.
This is the first Veggie Tales DVD I've purchased.  My nephew used to watch them when he was little, so I was familiar with the concept.  Now that I've seen this one a few times, I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something light-hearted and positive for their little ones.",1220140800,6,1309,4.54468085106383

2833961,4,B000Q7ZKY8,"If you are looking for a longer veggie tales product, this is the show for you.  It is about twice as long as the usual veggie tales DVD, with what is basically a two show format.  It is as good as their usual stuff, which is to say, entertaining with good value lessons.  The only drawback is if, like me, you get really tired of watching these ""tales"" over and over and over (as the kids like to do), you have to watch twice as much on this DVD.",1197849600,2,447,4.0
2833962,4,B000Q7ZKY8,"I usually skip the VeggieTale collection DVD's.  For some reason, I bought this one.  And I've had fun taking this trip down memory lane.

This DVD features three classic Veggie stories, two silly songs, and one all new tale.

First up, ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" reminds us that God can use us no matter how big or small we are by retelling the story of David and Goliath.

Then comes ""Bob's Vacation,"" the new story on the disc.  In it, a misunderstood phone conversation sends Bob off on his vacation depressed.  Does Larry really think so little of him?  And can Larry answer the fan mail and water Bob's plants while he's gone?  Or will the other Veggies get in the way?

Then we go way back in time for ""The Gourds Must be Crazy"" from the third Veggie video ever.  This is the story that introduced Jimmy and Jerry Gourd, in fact.  The crew of the USS Applepies must figure out a way to avoid being hit by a giant popcorn asteroid.  Maybe those new guys who are always eating can help.

Finally, we come to ""A Snoodle's Tale.""  In this story, told in classic Dr. Seuss style, we learn of one snoodle who set out to discover why he was created.  After some nasty encounters, he sets out for solitude.  Will he find it there?

In between, we get to enjoy the classic silly songs ""Belly Button"" and ""Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps.""

When I got this, I was hoping to really enjoy the new story.  However, ""Bob's Vacation"" was the weakest.  Even though I love the verse Qwerty gives us during the story, it isn't worth getting this video to see.  And the veggie on the street interviews after each episode were just a little weird for me.

However, the other stories are still as wonderful as they were when first done.  Granted, we do really get to see how far their computer animation as progressed as we go back and forth in time.  But everything is so entertaining I really don't care about that.

While there are good stories here, there's little reason to buy this disc.  Die hard fans already have the best parts elsewhere.  Buy it only if you are a collector or you don't have the classic stories presented here.",1187136000,62,2126,4.40979381443299

It has a lot of content on it, so if you don't have most of these titles this is a great buy.

If you are getting it just for the extra video ""Bob's Vacation"" don't bother though. It's not really up to par with other things Veggie Tales have done.

All the other episodes on here are great though. And they even throw in some silly songs including ""The Belly Button Song"" one of my 2 year old son's personal favorites.",1327017600,2,525,4.127450980392157

I know so many people - so many ADULTS - who should watch this. It does have value as a religious lesson (a gift that's demanded is no gift at all), but the lesson in self-worth is excellent.

Here's what you look like, here's how I see you.
Keep this in your pack and you'll find it will free you;
From all of the pictures, and all of the lies
That others make up just to cut down your size.
And lastly, your wings, you know what they're for.
Not just to fly, son, I want you to soar.

Love it. My daughter is sensitive, and I know I will pull this video out often when bumps down the road bring a tear or two.",1281139200,26,737,3.9066666666666667

On his 1st birthday I put it on and when the song ""I ain't got no belly button"" started playing all the adults in the room cracked up! Everyone loved it. The kids danced in front of the television and sang.
My aunt use to watch these and I never understood why until I started watching them myself.
I fell in love with them! These stories are not just for kids; these stories are wonderful and have great lessons for all. I am hooked!
