1231844,2,B00000JGDA,"We were two people who saw the film, and we both agreed that while well-acted, the word that came to mind was ""unsatisfying."" Some strong scenes, and some good acting, but some of the dialog was - I can only call it - ""artificially sharp."" (But that might be the way the characters were supposed to be, according to the writer.) We were sort of looking forward to seeing the film just end, to be honest. I recorded it from TV, and have now erased it.",1111104000,,450,4.244186046511628
1231845,2,B00000JGDA,"Though I am unfamiliar with Bruce Wagner's novel, which he has adapted and directed himself, going from the book's editorial comments I have researched, the movie version seems to be vastly different. The book was praised for it's powerful and revolting representation of Hollywood characters and their drug-dazed sexually abusive lifestyles. Oliver Stone is quoted as saying the book ""is like a wire stretched across the throat."" However Wagner's screenplay seems to have lost most of the book's characters, their cell-phone and email means of communication, the stench of gossip, and his much admired humour. Perhaps if the film worked on it's own terms, this might be forgiven, but even as an adaptation of a best-selling novel, it leaves the viewer in a state of exasperation. It reads like a foreign movie where someone forgot to type the subtitles. Wagner cannot be faulted on any major technical level as a film-maker, apart from the essential one of providing a clear narrative. As the title suggests, the theme here is death. The interconnecting characters are either dying or interact with someone who is, specifically from cancer or AIDS. However since all the sturm und drang eventually has no point because all the threads are never brought together, we're left unsatisfied. Wagner's casting is another issue. The idea of Andrew McCarthy as a bad actor is initially funny, but since he doesn't possess the skill to play a father or a believable lover, for that matter, the casting seems suicidal. Rosanna Arquette also has a problem portraying a woman with a dark past, who may be unbalanced. The best performer is Elizabeth Perkins, quite magnificent as a woman who is HIV positive. It's only a pity she is partnered with McCarthy. It's wonderful to see Salome Jens on screen again, but she is given little to do, as is Buck Henry, Amanda Donohoe, and even Frank Langella. Wagner uses some cute watch and time double entrendes, gives us the phenomena of an HIV positive only party, and presents L.A. Jews and their bathing of the dead. But there's not one laugh line. The ones who so admired him for his supposed accurate portrayal of Hollywood may be appalled to see that he sold out for the movies.",985478400,9,2214,4.906666666666666

1231868,5,B00000JGDA,"Love and Loss. Each was dealt with differently. The acting of Andrew McCarthy was superb as usual as was that of Roseanna Arquette who has spent her career showing us what great sensitivity and range she has. Luckily they represented the two major characters who found a sort of peace with loss. I was particularly impressed with the creative and ultimately beautiful way Roseanna's character (Rachel?) worked through what she was experiencing. It was written, filmed and portrayed in a lovely and compassionate way.  It's not unusual that a loss will dredge up other issues and feelings that were suppressed. I did feel like some of the plot points could have either been more developed or left out and remained a great movie driven by the same major actors.",1450569600,,759,4.883720930232558

1231886,2,B00000JGDA,"I didn't like this film. The acting was good, but that wasn't the problem.  Believability was. I kept thinking that a huge amount of tragedies happened in a short period of time, so how did the family make it through 30 years of smooth sailing only to have more than half of the cast die or be almost dead in a week? Or have a psychotic breakdown or a death wish? And how did the characters rebound from each tragedy to the next while forgetting the one that preceded it? The son falls in love with an HIV positive woman, though attractive, who wasn't very nice. And he fell in love instantly.  How can these people be so literate, quoting serious literature, and make so many dumb mistakes. A second big problem is that no-one was really likable. Except Buck Henry's character. Great job by him btw. Aren't dying characters supposed to be likable on some level? And no-one had any sympathy for any of the soon to die. In fact, the dying people didn't express any fear. Only concern about the practical aspects of their dying. How did someone go from crazy/psychotic to normal in a week? How did that happen? And then the line at the end ""Stay out of mental hospitals"" (or whatever was said). Wha? The third problem, something that really bothered me was that stuff kept happening bad that we find out about some time after the event from some comment made by someone. The child and ex dying in a car accident and the lady dying of aids... there was no grieving at the time the things happened.  Hey! What happened to Frank Langella's wife in the last half of the movie while he was having sex with Uhura? Does that actress get paid for the whole movie or half? Sorry I don't remember any characters names. I didn't feel I knew enough about them to want to remember. Okay, so you take off in a train with somebody else's kid... isn't that kidnapping? Aren't there legal issues? Are there grandparents?  The washing thing seemed odd. All of that to use it as a device to see the dead kid. Puhleeze. It's not like they we having an affair... or maybe they cut that out of the movie. And why would the daughter call her father Scheherazade? That's a girl character.

Best lines of the movie were both by Frank Langella. ""Jesus, it's like a movie."" (yeah, that's the problem).

And my favorite, Frank Langella repeating back: ""Mona Dewaere doesn't like her hair."" (she should've stayed with the intergalactic whatchamacallits).

There's a lot more I could criticize, but all I can say is they lost me. I'm done. I'm exhausted.",1407974400,6,2522,4.517543859649122

It had too many characters with side stories that detracted from what the movie was supposed to be about. But, maybe I was missing something, all the characters were dealing with loss of some sort and all of these veteran performers gave standing performances.

1231891,5,B00000JGDA,"I'm Losing You is based on one of Bruce Wagner's novels, and was his sole feature film as a director. (I believe he did a documentary on women directors.) This film was not a box office success, but if you follow the commentary and what the actors have to say, it is brilliant and not at all a downer, although it deals with death and disease. Rosanne Arquette and Frank Langella are outstanding, although the large ensemble cast is also excellent. One of the plot lines was lifted by and expanded in Galaxy Quest, a sci-fi spoof. This is not a spoof, although Mr. Wagner's mordant humor takes on 12 Step programs. I respect him enormously; he has done several screen plays and a television series which mightily miffed the Scientologists. I have read all his novels, but haven't started Dead Stars. Very talented man.",1353715200,,818,4.6482758620689655
1231892,2,B00000JGDA,"This movie states unrated.  It should be rated R to warn viewers or potential buyers of the strong language and sexual content.  The story seemed to have too many sub plots for my taste.  The actors did a fine job with what they had.  Some of the scenes could have been done more tastefully and still made the point they intended.  The overuse of the one particular word made it less attractive.  My mother told me many years ago when I asked why people cursed so much that they did so because they lacked a good command of the english language and knew no other way to express themselves. Some people might not agree with me but the use of crude language in movies and music these days takes away from the story or song.
Try something. Put a DVD in right now that has R rated language in it and play a small part with these
words in the dialogue.  Stop. Think of words that would show the same intent and replay it replacing those words.  Do you still get the same information intended by the author as you did with the rougher
language?  Just a thought.  Good actors.  Bad choice for these talented people.",1351296000,4,1108,4.330097087378641
1231893,3,B00000JGDA,"First of all I only purchased this movie because Norman Reedus was listed on Cast. Don't bother with this if that's a reason you may want to view this movie as he appears for one very short scene as an angry, immature lover. It's otherwise a good story about a man diagnosed with Cancer, and his ""semi-dysfunctional"" family. Even though each character type was interesting, as was their way of dealing with Cancer in the family - this movie either needed just a little more time or less characters. There are some amusing scenes, some emotional (but not tear-jerking) elements; another reason not to bother with this movie is if you want to get a feeling of how it is to deal with Cancer in the family. Not one of the better movies I've seen, especially for one that has a cast of actors I usually enjoy much more.",1323388800,9,814,4.469798657718121
1231894,2,B00000JGDA,"Watch this DVD if you are into Lifetime specials.

This painfully inept drama is crafted with a loosing blend of melodrama, bad jokes, overwrought plot twists, and a myriad of under-developed characters.  The central issue here is this film's over-broadness; I'm Loosing You takes a stab at every possible genre. Never really allowing itself enough time to explore the possibilities within one central story with well developed characters, it sprawls out its never-ending twists and turns over the lives of at least 7 different characters, lives that somehow strangely (although predictably) manage to intertwine (much in the way Crash did in 2004).  The minute we become attached to a character, the film jump cuts to another; it's annoying!

I give this movie 2 stars (instead of 1) because it is not a complete waste of time.  It can manage to entertain you when you are under the weather and are looking for something very basic.",1265500800,,933,4.993548387096774

""I'm Losing You"" leaves you with the wish of staying with these characters, of finding out how their lives continue and if they will be able to find happiness in the end. I know that I will carry this movie in my heart for a long time.

Oh, and on a lighter note: In the movie, Frank Langella's character is the producer of a science fiction series called ""Blue Matrix"". Every Star Trek fan shouldn't miss those scenes. They are hilarious. With all the catastrophes that Andrew McCarthy's character has to endure, he isn't spared wearing a Next Generation inspired outfit (including the forehead). And Janeway fans, watch out for the ""Blue Matrix"" captain's new hairdo. :-)",1140912000,5,850,4.862068965517241
1231896,4,B00000JGDA,"Bruce Wagner's screen adaptation of his novel I'M LOSING YOU has some of the more intelligent dialogue to be encountered in a film.  Since Wagner also directed this little gem, brimming over with excellent actors, we can be assured that his message of death as a necessary component in the cycle of life is intact.  Despite the dour content of the story this film actually leads to a credible sense of how deaths can ultimately be redemptive: it is all in how vulnerable we allow ourselves to become in coping with this life change.

The story is focused on a wealthy Los Angeles family headed by television producer of sci-fi series Perry Krohn (Frank Langella), married to a psychiatrist Diantha (Salome Jens) despite having a 'helper' mistress Mona (Amanda Donahue), 'stepfather' of a disillusioned daughter Rachel (Rosanna Arquette) and a has-been actor son Bertie  (Andrew McCarthy) who makes a living selling back insurance policies to AIDS patients: the father has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and his attempts to set his will in order is the catalyst for the story.  The son is separated from his ex-wife, a disturbed addicted woman Lidia (Gina Gershon) and the two fight over custody of their young child Tiffany (Aria Noelle Curzon).  Complicating matters is the fact that Rachel has never been told until now that her biologic father murdered her mother and committed suicide AND that her stepfather had a onetime sexual fling with her mother.

Things begin to consistently fall apart: the son falls in love with one of the AIDS victims, Aubrey (Elizabeth Perkins),  to whom he sells insurance who has a son and lives in horror that she will soon die and her son will be abandoned. About this same time Tiffany is killed in an automobile accident, the fault of her drugged out mother, and Rachel embraces her Jewish heritage by learning how to perform the body cleansing ritual performed as a loving act on the dead - the dead being Tiffany.  And at this peak of crises, Aubrey dies in a hospital, succumbing to every complication known to AIDS.

How this fractured family comes together in the midst of all these losses and lifetime barriers to communication serves as the resolution of this complex but infinitely interesting story.

The actors all give bravura performances, relishing the smart dialogue and the multilayered meanings to each encounter captured by the fine cinematographer.  This may not be a film for everyone, but for those seeking more form a film than entertainment will find much food for thought here. Recommended.

7911948,3,B00000JGDA,"Well when it rains it pours. This movie was so true to life. Too real. Too sad. Good acting. I could have done without the sex scenes (LOL). And there were a few weird cuts that were a bit confusing.
I can see why this film bombed at the box office. We, viewers, can only deal with 1 tragedy per movie and we want a much more hopeful ending. This film depicts what my family calls, a storm of life or midnight hour. Theses are scenarios that no one wants to watch because, we are all living them. Cancer, HIV, infidelity, family secrets, child abuse, mental illness, substance abuse, strained family relationships, and death all in one movie? We watch films to escape reality. This film reminded me of a commentary, hopeless and helpless. I couldn't stop watching because I couldn't believe how frank this film was concerning human behavior, strange.

7911949,3,B00000JGDA,"This movie has a good cast. It held my attention and I enjoyed watching it. However, it has its share of flaws.  The story line seems somewhat implausible, but it didn't have to appear that way. It could have been a very engaging drama, but because each scene is very staged, and unto itself, more like the way a theatrical play would be done, there is a lack of momentum leading to any kind of story arc.  If the script and the scenes had been more developed so as to give a sense of time going by, and life unfolding, I think the dramatic, painful  part of the plot would have been more easy to accept as a believable turn of events. Instead, a series of depictions of tragic and emotional events for an assortment of different characters were thrust together one after the other. Also, the character development was minimal. Each character seemed only to be existing for the lines in the movie, so there was little dimension to them and it made it hard to care about them or fully engage with their lives.  Yet it was a story full of tragedy and heartache and by rights should have evoked some emotion.  I'm sure there could be a remake resulting in a real tearjerker if handled differently.",1500681600,,1194,4.433789954337899
