5054298,3,B0074JOE2K,This was a good movie but I did not like how it ended. I needed to know more about what was going to happen next. I did however enjoy the theme of showing a female enlisted in the arms forces.,1359504000,,192,3.825
5054299,3,B0074JOE2K,Interesting because it's from a female perspective returning home after being deployed and her adjustment of being back home .,1357689600,,126,5.35
5054300,4,B0074JOE2K,"Linda Cardellini is a wonderful actress.  I loved her on ""E.R."" back in the day.

Now she's a mother with two daughters and a cheating husband and back from the ""war"" as a Reservist.

When she moves she tells every untold story that soldiers never tell.  She's so fine an actress without saying
much at all; it's all in her body and her beautiful face.

I understand my son better now as a returned veteran who just can't seem to setttle back down and be at peace
in a non-war zone.

Brilliant film.  But oh how I wish there was peace.",1354752000,,535,4.237623762376238
5054301,5,B0074JOE2K,"I have spent many years involved in attempting to characterize a state-of-being my best friend, a silver-star, purple-heart, two-tour veteran of Vietnam, and I have recognized in each other:  Mutant Consciousness. We each seem to possess that perhaps undefinable focus upon reality which exists far outside the norm. My friend has also been diagnosed, and has rejected the authority of those who make such diagnoses, as experiencing PTSD. Personally, I never sought any sort of straight explainations for who and what I am.  Let it be said, though, that the two of us and very few others we have run across possess, or admit to possessing, this mutant outlook. Kelli most assuredly does, as must Ms Johnson -- or at least she knows someone who does. Possibly from a couple of old guys a lyric from an old song might help one to understand. The Jefferson Airplane sang: ""When the truth is found to be lies/And all the joy within you dies....""  Their answer was finding someone to love.  Kelli must lose her husband, leave her children behind for this simple reason.  Only someone else who knows the things you do (John Slattery?) can possibly become your lover.  But then, can you be his?  The existential truth of the movie is profound and, rather than sad, is liberation.  We are all alone.  Those who think not are lying to themselves and to their children.  Kelli must fly solo into the valley, and whether or not she returns, there will never be for her a Canada to run to; her children will fear her, her friends desert her.  Unless she moves off the grid as has Bud she will never find peace.  Or Venison.
  Just a note: Linda Cardellini is the greatest at portraying those with mutant consciousnesses or those developing same.  I still love Freaks and Geeks.
  I'll probably watch this movie a dozen more times.  It's Great.
  Another note, the theme of Mutant Consciousness is central to a novel I am finishing this month.  Entitled Army Girl, it covers much of the same issues and relationships that Ms Johnson's movie so brilliantly portrays and will be published by Create Space.",1354406400,8,2090,4.734072022160665
5054302,5,B0074JOE2K,"This is a very underrated movie.  You won't like it if you are looking for action, but if you like solid acting performances this is for you.",1354406400,,141,4.222222222222222
5054303,3,B0074JOE2K,"Good performances and an important issue.  Not sure it's Academy Award material, however.  But it is a good watch and makes one think.",1353888000,,134,4.782608695652174
5054304,4,B0074JOE2K,Underrated little gem. Deserves to be seen. The kind of film that gets lost Oscar time but everyone was excellent.,1353801600,,114,4.75
5054305,5,B0074JOE2K,"Linda Cardellini gives a fantastic performance in this fresh take on the returning soldier movie. Refreshing to see Michael Shannon in an understated role as her well-meaning husband. A charming, rough-edged John Slattery. Beautifully shot. Terrific and moving film.",1337126400,2,266,5.846153846153846
5054306,3,B0074JOE2K,"""This is just a giant waste of time. I can't do it anymore."" After Kelli (Cardellini) returns home from the war she finds it much harder to adjust then expected. Finding life mundane and pointless she begins to drift. When her husband Mike (Shannon) leaves with the kids she is forced to deal with her problem. There have been many, many movies made about problems returning soldiers experience when trying to adjust to day-to-day life. ""Home Of The Brave"" is one of the more recent great ones. Like that movie this one deals with how she feels that life is so mundane and boring it begins to affect her relationships with others. The main problem with this one is that it seems to take forever to go anywhere. The acting is great and the story is good but again it is very slow and sometimes hard to stay interested in. I would compare this to the recent ""Take Shelter"" movie in its pacing and feel. If you liked that movie you will probably like this one too. Overall, a very OK movie that could have been better. I give it a B-.",1332288000,3,1031,4.375
5054337,4,B0074JOE2K,"linda cardellini is great in anything. okay movie, but i'll watch her in anything. it's a slow moving movie, but i enjoyed it.",1384560000,,126,4.521739130434782
5054338,2,B0074JOE2K,"I like most of the work by Linda Cardinelli but this movie was not one of them despite her being nominated for an Independent best actress award.  She is a good actor but this script was just bad, the ending was terrible.",1376352000,,221,4.261904761904762
5054339,2,B0074JOE2K,"I liked the idea of the movie.  I liked the fact that she was a veteran and served her time.  But, I just did not enjoy the movie.",1369440000,,130,3.607142857142857
5054340,3,B0074JOE2K,"Why is this film in the lesbian section? Although good acting, very true account of what is happening with our returning service men and women, I did not intend to rent a film that dealt with men and women sex trials and tribulations.
Need to put this in the drama section regular mainstream movies..",1367020800,2,300,4.574074074074074
5054341,4,B0074JOE2K,"Pretty good. I very much enjoyed watching this, it kept my attention.  I see no need to write any more, let each person judge it for themself.",1366502400,,142,4.2592592592592595
5054342,4,B0074JOE2K,"I enjoyed this film. It's a typical slow-moving indie drama. That's what I like.

I felt like Linda Cardelini did a really good job showing emotion, and played the part of a returning soldier well. It's one of those films that isn't always flattering on an actress, but to me, that shows a really good actress.

The film left me pondering, and wondering what else may have happened in this story...and that indicates a good film in my book!",1364169600,,440,4.556962025316456
5054343,1,B0074JOE2K,"depressing, slow moving, lousy acting, terrible filming, poor all around. i'm mad cuz i can never get this time back.",1363737600,,117,4.9
5054344,4,B0074JOE2K,It was a good movie for all even the current exchange students we are hosting.  Would like more of these it helps the exchange students assimilate the language,1362441600,,159,4.678571428571429
5054345,4,B0074JOE2K,"After a tour of duty with the Army overseas, Kelli returns to Ohio to her family and the expectation of re-assimilating back into the life that she knew prior her deployment.  Reality trumps her expectations, however, and so begins a narrowing journey to find solid ground again.  This is the crux of 'Return'.

Make no mistake : Linda Cardellini puts this movie on her back, and carries it the entire way.  She turns in the best performance of her career to date as the young soldier struggling with life as she once knew it.  Michael Shannon somewhat steps outside of his comfort zone in his role as her husband, Mike.  While often playing quirky, left-of-center characters with strong personalities, he opts for a reserved, soft-spoken approach to play Mike.  His performance is as solid as any that he's ever given, and his ever-expanding resume continues to make him one of the more reliable actors working today.

Evenly paced, 'Return' is a character study of a life removed from balance, and the endeavor to restore what once was.",1361836800,5,1038,4.824858757062147
5054346,4,B0074JOE2K,"Good movie about women veterans returning from war. War is good for destroying lives abroad and here too.

Good buy!",1361145600,,116,4.8
8509995,4,B0074JOE2K,Good indie movie slow moving drama with strong female lead. No violence or anything like that in this film just daily life and really enjoyed it.,1520208000,,145,4.615384615384615
8509996,5,B0074JOE2K,Great movie  shows the stresses of deployment,1518048000,,45,5.428571428571429
8509997,4,B0074JOE2K,"A good film that explains the family hardships of multiple deployments, especially women. Linda Cardellini is believable as a returning soldier. The story isn't about the horrors of war. Instead it delves into the very real problems of deployed and returning women in the National Guard/Reserves. I served returning Military as a Chaplain in the VA (22 years) and Cardellini's character accurately reflects many of the women veterans I saw at the Veteran's Administration Hospital and Clinics. Worth a watch.",1485302400,,508,5.3625
8509998,2,B0074JOE2K,"This title would have gotten 4 stars from me, until I got to the very end. Linda Cardellini's performance is spot-on; having been in her situation (albeit as a man), I can say her attitudes, responses, and troubles were written and portrayed realistically.

POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD:

Without going into detail, because I don't want to spoil the story, I just want to explain my 2-star rating. In an otherwise good movie, with some excellent acting, the ending just chopped off. While I understand the message at the end, it just felt like poor direction, a dash of cold water throwing me out of the movie, just because of the way it was cut. I thought at first that the download had quit, or that there was an error somewhere. I had to scan backward and view the ending again just to try to find out if I'd missed something. If not for this, I would have rated the movie much higher.",1471651200,,883,4.478260869565218

8510003,5,B0074JOE2K,"I love this movie, in addition to RETURN being a remarkable story from the POV of a female soldier serving overseas and good performances by the entire cast, especially Linda Cardellini, I also have a small role in this film.",1402617600,,225,4.65
8510004,4,B0074JOE2K,"I was haunted by this story of a woman who returns to her husband and daughters after a tour of duty in Iraq. Like many veterans, she finds it difficult, if not impossible, to return to her life as it was. I thought the performances were first-rate, especially by Linda Cardellini and Michael Shannon, and found the film to be life-like and not overplayed. The kind of film that stays in your mind for some time afterwards.",1401667200,,423,4.5064935064935066
