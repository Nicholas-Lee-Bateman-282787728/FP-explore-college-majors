3982349,5,B002SVP9J6,"Obsessive compulsive behavior can be hazardous to your health even if you're a bad guy like Sean Bean. This is one of the oldest crime story ever told i.e. the straight guy ends up with the bad guys money and the bad guy wants it back. This one,however, has a twist: the bad guy is a number guy who has O.C.D. and will not settle for anything less than every penny he is owed. In the process he turns the straight guy and his wife into bad guys like himself. I really liked this movie even when it slowed down a little in the middle, because it was a trick they played on the audience. They were setting us up for a big change in the straight couple's character and a surprise ending. There were little flaws in the movie like; Bean practicing Yoga and smoking like chimney,calling the Illinois DMV the Chicago DMV,and a cop-out repayment plan to some of the victims especially to their jerk of a banker. But, by and large this is a very good crime movie with an exceptional ending.",1292112000,10,982,4.313513513513514
3982350,3,B002SVP9J6,"A tale with potential that missed the minimum bar by several notches.  Sean Bean attempts to play an interesting character but he's too contradictory in his later decision over a small sum of money.  Nevertheless, it's a sometimes engaging enough tale of a man mentally dominating and humiliating a husband and wife who have stolen his dirty money.  WHEN WATCHED: 10/07/2010 to 10/09/2010; MY GRADE: C plus to B minus.",1286668800,4,418,4.942857142857143

3982352,4,B002SVP9J6,"My love for independent film, and great actors drew me toward this flick.  Sean Bean always delivers..and in this one it's twice as nice.  Sean Bean plays a set of brothers (possibly twins but one looks shorter and skinnier than the other.) One of whom has been recently incarcerated after a 'job' that took in over five hundred thousand dollars.  The incarcerated one calls his brother, also Sean Bean to find retrieve, and split the money with him.  The money was thrown out of the window during a police chase and the only thing they know is that it hit a white station wagon with wood panel siding.
The writing in this movie is not the most original, but Sean Bean, Chris Hemsworth, and Victoria Proefeta turn in excellent performances that draw you into the sometimes unbelievable situation and give you free reign to suspend your disbelief.  Cash at it's core is a story of personal morals, survival, and humanity that is wrapped in the vestiges of luck violence and fear.  I enjoyed every single frame, line, scene, what have you of this little sleeper indie and if there is ever a sequel, which the way it ends suggests there may be I will be the first one to buy it.  Cash is not the most original story but what does in terms of bringing together a well rounded story, and putting forth characters that you either love, or love to hate can not be denied.  Highly entertaining and worth a purchase if the price is right for you.",1284681600,28,1437,4.521235521235521

Love seeing the up and coming before they got up. Sean Bean, what can we say, he's always awesome and you get two for the price of one. Two roles and he really lets the Yorkshire accent fly in his portrayal of the 'skeevier' brother with the Elvis hair do.

to get into crime to pay him back. But the entire two hours is slow to get to the conflict of
middle-class kids being threatened into slavery. Very poor direction. Except for Sean Bean,

In 2010, I remember seeing posters of this movie at train stations and thinking its probably not worth seeing...
Four years later, I happen to come across this film and I think to myself ""ehhh what the hell...lets see if its good""...and to my surprise it was actually very entertaining.

This film proves three things:
1) you don't need a big budget to film a good movie
2) the movie is a great example of how money can corrupt ordinary citizen(s)
3) Sean Bean should only be casted as a villain...he is really-really good at playing dark characters...a.k.a Pike Kubick.

3982448,3,B002SVP9J6,"A married couple's seeming good fortune, has unexpectedly consequences in Ca$h: The Root of All Evil (2009), as an overzealous criminal type, looks to collect a debt.  Chris Hemsworth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B00E5I2MDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>) plays Sam, an ordinary guy who has a suitcase full of cash fall on his car.  After Sam and his wife Leslie (Victoria Profeta) play off some debts, and go on a spending spree, they are visited by Pyke Kubic (Sean Bean,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldeneye/dp/B009NUV0E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldeneye</a>), the brother of the man who originally stole the money.

Kubic recovers the readily available cash, but refuses to write off any losses, and demands that the couple settle the debt to the penny.  Moving into their home, the insistent Kubic takes over Sam and Leslie's lives.  Even after selling their new SUV, and taking a loan on their home, the couple is still short, so Kubic forces them to become criminals.

Even with the oddball turn down a criminal path, Ca$h is fairly well written, and with a mostly low key tone, sticks pretty close to reality.  Profeta and Hemsworth do a good job as the beleaguered couple, but it's Sean Bean who keeps the fires stoked, as his character's persistent focus on numbers, and increasingly over the top behavior, keeps you interested in what happens next.  If you are a Prime member who likes suspense, don't pass this one by.",1404086400,,1537,5.6521739130434785

3982453,4,B002SVP9J6,"Some of the blandest of stories can be made into gems by the performance of one man. The story in Ca$h is by no means original, but the addition of an outstanding bad guy, with his own original way of doing things, makes the film worth seeing. Sean Phelan (Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth) is down on his luck and about to have his house taken by the bank, when an amazing thing happens. While driving on the highway, he sees a high speed chase in progress. The robbers, not wanting to be caught with the evidence, throw their loot off the overpass and right onto Phelan's car. The Phelan's think that God has smiled on them and they start making plans for life in the fast lane, when their luck turns again. Thanks to their greed, the robber (Sean Bean) is able to track them down and shows up at the Phelan's door, demanding his money back. LOTR's Sean Bean stars as the bad guy and he really has turned into one of the best criminal actors you could get. He's this big scary guy, with such a calm demeanor, willing to tell you everything that's on his mind. Bean takes the Phelan's through a wild week, trying to get back his money in a variety of ways, that I think will really surprise you. One of Bean's strength as an actor turns out to be a weakness to his character in this film. As I said, he has a way of always telling you what's on his mind, and in this film it's all about the cash. That being said, Bean keeps trying to figure out the amount of money left to be repaid and it gets pretty annoying. Also of note, while this was a pretty entertaining film, it is also about 40 minutes too long. Admittedly, the story is a bit thin, so the writers try to expand the story as much as they can. While it's terrific at first, by the end, the film is seriously lagging, and it takes a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. Ca$h doesn't offer many surprises, but the cast is terrific and it most defiantly has it's moments. It's the perfect film to use if you're looking to kill some time without having to think too much about it.",1397952000,2,2033,4.22879177377892

I use this movie as an example because Cash reminds me in some ways of this...a very enjoyable, humorous, though dark and violent film.  Definitely a guilty pleasure!  This is probably as close as Sean Bean will ever get to a comedy movie---what a shame---like the saying goes---dying is easy, comedy is hard---this movie makes me think he has the knack for it.

3982473,4,B002SVP9J6,"I bought this since I've always been a fan of Sean Bean ever since Sharpe. I had seen the trailer and thought it seemed really fun.

Well the film is a nice easy watch. It's not too challenging. It's more of a Saturday night action film while you have a few beers. It's fun actually with some nice laughs along the way. The twist at the end was ok if not a little predictable.",1349654400,4,376,4.081081081081081
3982474,1,B002SVP9J6,"One word to describe this movie ""BAD"". To say you must suspend disbelief to get through it is an understatement. And I didn't care for their subtle racist innuendos either.  Save your time and money.",1349049600,2,199,4.685714285714286
3982475,2,B002SVP9J6,"Sorry but TO ME this was a swing and a miss.

Thief tosses suitcase full of money out the car window during a police chase and it lands on a vehicle of a young man.

Young man brings it home and him and his wife go on a spending spree, beginning with their mortgage which is 3 payments behind and the bank is threatening foreclosure, a new vehicle and new furniture.

Thief contacts his brother who tracks down the happy recipients of this windfall by assuming someone with a suitcase of cash would go out and buy a new vehicle and pay with cash -- breaks into DMV, pulls the FEW vehicles recently paid in cash and tracks them down. He then spends the next 4-5 days with this couple as they go about collecting all the cash they hadn't spent yet, selling the new vehicle, taking out a loan against their home and then robbing multiple convenience stores because he wants every penny of the original haul back.

It made sense up to the robberies (and that was stretching it a bit). And besides being a bit unbelievable, it wasn't even enjoyable.  Not one I'd watch again or recommend.",1348358400,,1083,4.395
3982496,2,B002SVP9J6,"While the film is well filmed and the story is decent the three main characters just pissed me off all in their own way.  I spent at least an hour of this movie wondering why I kept watching.

The ending isn't a let down though so that's nice.

Just wanted to post some words so I could leave my 2 star rating and move on.

Pick another movie if you want quality - choose this if you have 2 hours to waste.",1347840000,,406,3.9146341463414633
3982497,5,B002SVP9J6,I loved this movie. Sean Bean was excellent in it. Chris Hemsworth and Victoria Profeta were very compelling as a couple who finds a suitcase of cash and go on a spending spree. Sean Bean shows up to get his brothers money back and hell begins for the couple. This movie was a fun ride and I highly recommend it.,1347753600,3,312,4.216666666666667
3982498,2,B002SVP9J6,"I had to suspend disbelief quite a few times to be able to get into this movie. There are so many movies and novels about ""found money"" that I can't imagine that many couples would be stupid enough to quit their jobs, and start spending it immediately and without regard on a $70K Range Rover and a house full of new furniture. Everyone knows to lay low and spend it slowly and not attract attention. The bad guy is able to track them though the presumption that they would immediately buy a new car, and even though he is new to town somehow finds another bad guy who not only sells guns but also happens to have the keys to the DMV(!!!) (What!?!) so he can pull the records on all recent ""cash"" vehicle purchases. And for some reason the couple gives the wife's mother half the money in a Christmas box for safekeeping!?! Why? Never heard of safe deposit boxes? Floor safes? Jeez.

I still don't get why they couldn't get another actor to play Sean Bean's brother. Stunts like that just pull you out of the story, since you become focused on how they made two of an actor you know there is only one of...

Despite this stuff, and more that made me want to smack the writer around, I did get into the story. There were some actual good moments where the twists were unexpected, and Hemsworth and Bean are good actors that I like.

The movie has no moral center, though, and virtually everyone in it is creepy, mean, and stupid or self-destructive on some level, including the bit characters, the couple, and the mother. By the end I was hoping they all died. Very jaded look at the human race. I get why people like it and others don't. I think I am right in the middle. Two and a half stars since I did get into it, but I really want to give it two for not trying a little harder. I have a lot of problems with the tidy ending, as well. I would have driven that car off a bridge, rather than involve someone else, but again... just sloppy.",1346716800,5,1941,4.269021739130435
3982499,1,B002SVP9J6,Got this 'cause I love Chris Hemsworth. Well I should have looked at the rating 'cause I didn't expect a lot of cussing in it. It's like every 5 mins. or less! Not many bloody scenes. Glad the ending went well.,1344211200,3,210,4.146341463414634
3982500,2,B002SVP9J6,"I recently viewed this movie and found it to be far less enjoyable than I had hoped. This was disappointing, as I really like actors Chris Hemsworth and Sean Bean. The story was also set in chicago, and living in the Chicago suburbs, it's always fun to see the local metropolitan area up on the screen. What I was expecting was an action movie with some sort of twist to the end. What I ended up with was a plodding story with a completely unbelievable antagonist. Likewise, the protagonists behave in completely unrealistic ways that just make you roll your eyes and ask ""Seriously?"" I can't figure out how this movie has received so many high review scores. I'd say it is below average in most every way.",1343088000,6,706,4.5234375

3982502,4,B002SVP9J6,"Sean Bean plays a British bad guy and his twin brother in the Cook Co. Jail. His brother, Reese had a suitcase of illegal money which he tossed out the window while be chased by Chicago's finest. The suitcase lands on top of a Buick station wagon. Pyke, the brother who is not on jail is tasked to locate the money by following the cash being spent in Chicago (not realistic, but it gets us from point A to point B). Point B is Sam (Chris Hemsworth) and Leslie (Victoria Profeta) who have found the money. They are forced to give back the cash, but when they come up short because they had spent a few thousand of it, Pyke is not overly understanding.

The film is self described as a ""twist-filled crime thriller."" There were no significant twists, and the ""thriller"" aspect of the film was more akin to a 70's thriller than the fast paced modern films, and at times seemed a bit slow. I didn't find the acting as convincing as the other critics and Pyke's obsession was unrealistic...but without it there wouldn't be a story.
