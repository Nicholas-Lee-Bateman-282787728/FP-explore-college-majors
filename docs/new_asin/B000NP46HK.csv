8180424,5,B000NP46HK,"Nice DVD . I like the chin na here . I also like other kinds of chin na , but this is nice also . Some of the ideas may not all apply to modern day fighting , but there's definitely stuff you can learn that does apply . A nice add to my martial art library . I'm now teaching this form to my wife . I like the idea that she will at least have some methods in her tool box for her own self defence . She has a hard time with some of the other martial arts I have tried to show her , but she likes this and is getting it .",1461715200,2,520,3.452991452991453

8180427,5,B000NP46HK,"This is a spectacular way to learn Eagle Claw Kung fu, but you will need a dedicated partner. This is a very intricate, yet deadly acrobatic Kung fu dance with a view towards engaging each partner in both defense & offense modes. A very fine addition to my Library. Once you & your partner learn this dance refine your moves every day until it becomes second nature. To my knowledge, there is no other product available in the U.S. market that compares to this very high level of instruction in partner forms. Simply Outstanding!!!",1336867200,6,531,4.659574468085107
8180428,4,B000NP46HK,This was a pretty good product for learning a method of learning Chin Na techniques.  What this lacked were explanations stating how some of the less obvious techniques worked and better closeups.  This is a much better way of learning the techniques than some form only DVDs.,1312329600,,276,4.851063829787234
8180429,5,B000NP46HK,Dude....this dvd is so awesome. It is really worth it....but there is only one problem about this dvd; when grandmaster demonstrates her grab points...she doesn't tell us in details where we squeeze or where the pressure points are to strike....instead you have to just try to copy what she shows us as close as we can to the right exact spot. but other than that this is totally worth it. NOT KIDDING.,1232755200,,402,4.597222222222222
