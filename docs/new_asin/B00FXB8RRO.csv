6035387,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Ive been watching anime religiously for about 20 years and during that time it is a rare thing to have such a unique original story, characters, anime come out just blow your mind.  Im not much into the culture or the critiquing like a lot of other anime fans but one thing I do love is watching them, and there isn't many I havnt seen (japanese, english dub, what ever). This show is a must buy, and you will not regret, the only thing you will regret is the amount of time you waisted not seeing this show.
Oh and if your one of those types that have to see your shows in english dub, give this one a try in the Japanese language, I'll still bet you'll love this show. I'm not sure who they'll have for an english cast but they""ll have a tough time matching the Japanese actors performances for this anime.",1383091200,7,808,4.212903225806452
6035388,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Like many anime fans I first saw this as a fansub, and if you liked the fansub then must buy the box! It is an excellent story, and I am even cosplaying Levi from the series. Although, I must warn those who don't like blood, this is a bloody series, not as bad as Elfen Laid, but it doesn't illustrate what war could be like (that is if war was against 15meter giants)",1383004800,8,368,4.054794520547945
6035389,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Please also note: I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray Special Edition at $48.99, the price has fluctuated, and is currently in the $60+ range - just FYI.

UPDATE:  Funimation confirms 13 episodes.  Told ya so!

Also (via Funimation): ""A Limited Edition of Attack on Titan is also available to order in our Shop, and through other retailers. This edition includes:  - 3D lenticular art card - a 24 page digibook titled ""Notes from Beyond the Wall: Part 1 - plus 104 minutes of on-disc extras""

Also:

""Fans can now order the Collector's Edition of Attack on Titan, available exclusively in our FUNimation Shop. This edition will include the following:  - 4-pin collection (Military Police Regiment, Scout Regiment, Garrison Regiment, and Cadet Corps) - A replica of Eren's key necklace - A sword necklace featuring the Titan flesh paring blades - a 3D lenticular art card - a 24 page digibook titled ""Notes From Beyond the Wall: Part 1 - plus 104 minutes of on-disc extras""

-----------------------------------------------------------
I will of course update the product listing once I receive the actual item and check the quality, extras, and so on. Mainly I want to add a positive review of the series and the story to encourage folks to check it out. I expect this DVD/Blu-Ray to contain 13 episodes. If Funimation actually includes all 26 (25 numbered episodes plus the 13.5 'catch up' episode), then I will be shocked.

I have seen episodes 1 - 25 (on Crunchyroll with a premium membership), and like most people, I was originally skeptical about this series. In fact, I wasn't sold on it until I got through episode 3. Then I forced my girlfriend to watch it (who isn't fond of many anime series). Now we're cosplaying as Eren and Mikasa!

The manga was good, but the quality was what it was: a beginner series. The author Hajime Isayama pitched his first series to Shueisha and Weekly Shonen Jump. WSJ told him to clean it up and water it down for younger audiences. They said it wouldn't be a hit with the current style and story. So Isayama basically told them to stuff it and took it to Kodansha. Now, several years later, he has one of the most amazing breakout hits in anime history.

The series is complicated, and it poses many questions which aren't answered by episode 25. But to give you an idea of the initial premise: humanity is confined into a huge walled land with several cities and gates. Outside these walls are wilds populated by Titans - giant, seemingly unintelligent feeding creatures. And their diet consists of humans. Mankind hasn't figured out what they are or what they want or even how to properly combat them. The only thing that seems to work is using 3D maneuver gear to get behind a Titan's neck and cut out a chunk of their flesh just at the base of the neck. Otherwise, the Titans regenerate and continue eating. Oddly, they don't seem to need to eat to survive. Weird!

So things seem to be rosy and easy - except for the Expeditionary forces which continue venturing outside the walls to gather intelligence - when a couple of different Titans (not the mindless automaton-like Titans) break into the wall. Then all hell breaks loose. Mankind suffers a crippling defeat and has to move behind the next wall - losing a huge chunk of territory and people in the process.

What makes this series amazing is the characters. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are amazing and complex characters. It reminds me a bit of Fullmetal Alchemist, the completeness of the characters and my hopes that all goes well for them. Adding to the tension is the fact that death in this series is kind of pointless. It's not like some heroic battle against an evil opponent... no, in this series, when one gets eaten by a Titan it's a pretty worthless death. Which makes the tension much better.

The animation is high quality, but they studio kept to the style of the manga. Expect thick lines, and some distortion. But the finishing is excellent. The backgrounds (courtesy Production IG) are impressive. This series pops when viewed in HD. The music is a wonderful score composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (might now him from Gundam Unicorn, Blue Exorcist, and Guilty Crown).

One note: I love the series in Japanese because Romi Park (who voiced Edward Elric in FMA) is the voice of Zo Hange, she is amazing in this role as she is in most. Plus it's fun to hear her voice a female for once!

Show solidarity for humanity and buy this series! You will not be disappointed!",1382745600,34,4466,4.705128205128205
6035390,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you're probably aware of the monumental impact that Attack on Titan has had on the anime world since it's premiere. As somebody who has been viewing and reviewing anime for a long time, I can say that this is the rare series that actually lives up to the hype. People will complain about pacing issues about a third of the way in, but these problems, if you even consider them to be such, are minuscule compared to the overall levels of quality put into the series.

As far as the story goes, while it does have elements of other previous projects, such as Gantz and Claymore, it still remains a unique concept in and of itself. At it's core, Attack on Titan is a story about survival and humanity's refusal to die out, even against colossal odds. It brilliantly mixes elements of post apocalyptic, medieval fantasy, revenge, and even a little bit of steam punk, and it all comes together to form your classic 'hero versus monster' story. The voice acting is very well done, and I cannot say enough good things about the soundtrack. Above all else, I'm grateful that they had the good sense to put the series on hiatus while the manga continues, rather than giving us endless episodes of filler, that nobody really wants to see.

Not much word yet on what this box set will actually consist of, but I will be coming back to edit this review as necessary when more information is released, and of course when the set itself is in hand.

As a final note, I would like to encourage anybody that has already enjoyed the series to buy this product. With piracy at an all time high, it's becoming more and more difficult for anime to prosper in the US and Europe, so supporting truly excellent shows like this are more important now than ever. I think we all remember the sting of having to wait so many years to get the dub of Hellsing after Geneon went under, and even now it's almost impossible to find the box set of Higurashi without dropping hundreds of dollars. So please, if you love anime, and you love Attack on Titan in particular, buy the set and show them your support.",1382400000,268,2116,4.476683937823834

there's a total of 25 episodes

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants.

Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears out of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.

I can see why people loved the story of Attack on Titan it's set in a post apocalyptic world,

6035411,5,B00FXB8RRO,Its unique visual style and its fluid animation make it one of the most beautiful animes I've ever seen; its captivating story is just icing on the cake. I strongly recommend it. [...],1470873600,,184,4.606060606060606
6035412,5,B00FXB8RRO,"While waiting for the Attack on Titan PS4 game to be released, I decided to go ahead and watch the series on Funimation so that I could experience the story in its entirety without spoiling it through gameplay (in case that's how it works; I haven't played the game yet). I am fairly new to anime in general and was introduced to it via gaming (The Heroic Legend of Arslan PS4, to be exact) less than a year ago. To make a long story short, Attack on Titan has quickly become one of my favorite animes...I watched the entire first season on Funimation within three days and immediately bought this Part 1 Blu-Ray/DVD combo. (After having introduced the series to my husband last night for his first anime experience, he pleaded me to buy the Part 2 combo as well, so he could see the remainder of the season by next week.)

Attack on Titan is an action-packed but emotionally driven story of humanity desperately clinging to life in a laughably small, sectioned-off part of the world. They face extinction by a threat they do not fully understand and cannot fully overcome: human-like Titans up to fifty meters high (at least, in the first season) that feed on humans not for sustenance, but for the sport. While Attack on Titan does feature some very on-point humor in the first four episodes, it is unlike other animes (for example, Full Metal Alchemist) where it continues to bounce back and forth between humor and the realities of its serious story line until the seriousness and magnitude of its dystopia begins to dilute and become meaningless. The humor mostly shows up before the real fight against the titans begin and casualties begin to stack up high on the tally board, keeping the gravity of the true situation heavy upon the viewer's shoulders.

The characters are varied, unique, and likable. There are many women characters in the series that are badass, but they are also characters that are badasses because they are written WELL, not because they were shoehorned into being badasses *and* also a woman. Nothing feels like it is pandering (I actively avoid such pandering, myself). The anime mostly seems to avoid the more annoying cliches, though the main character has received some criticism for being cliched (I do not really agree, I love his ridiculously unceasing motivation, though I can see the cliche).

The artwork is beautiful, the music is moody and just perfect, the action is very well animated, and it is quite easy to tell the difference between the characters, despite it being a very large cast overall. I also MUST commend this anime for its ability to kill off so many likable characters without apology; there is a real danger to the characters you love, and thus the story keeps the viewer actively engaged because of the uncertainty of their fates. The anime is beautifully brutal and does not shy away from the realities of war, corrupt politics, or betrayals due to ignorance or misunderstandings. This is a mature anime for adults that can handle casualties and the sight of blood, and the agonies of tremendous loss.

As for the DVD set itself, it comes with four discs: two Blu-rays and two DVDs, both with the same content for whichever piece of technology you decide to use to play it on. The set covers episodes 1-13 of season one plus extras. You can watch it with the Japanese voice actors with (or without) English subtitles, OR with the English voice actors (which is the default option). Also, the voice actors are FANtastic, and this is coming from a person who usually hates watching dub anime and prefers Japanese voice actors. Particularly the voice actor who voices Armin, Josh Grelle; there are some scenes that require immense sadness and desperation from him that simply gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes. You also have the option of playing the anime as a marathon, where it will skip the opening and ending credit sequences for all but the first episode on the disc.

In summary, if you are viewing this product, odds are you already like the series. In the slight chance you haven't watched Attack on Titan yet, I urge you to try it. It is a superb piece of animated fiction that will go down in history as being a classic and one of the very best anime (and TV shows in general) has to offer. You owe it to yourself to check it out.",1470528000,8,4310,4.6732542819499345

After further checking into what the fuss was all about, I purchased the Titan S1 DVD and I'm glad I did! This is good sci-fiction/fantasy entertainment.

Attack on Titan, Part One introduces us to a world where Humanity has nearly been wiped out by giant humans called Titans. No one knows where the Titans came from, only that they suddenly appeared and proceeded to attack humanity. The giants come in varying sizes and are interested in two things - destruction and eating Humans. The surviving Humans retreat to cities protected behind high stone walls and lived for the next 100 years without the sighting of a single Titan. This changes when Wall Maria is breached by a new form of Titan, the Colossal Titan, and a series of events follows propelling our young heroes to join the military as defenders of the city.

The setting is ambiguous and incorporates several eras. There are elements of Medieval (castles, walls, swords), Industrial (the 3D Maneuvering Gear, Flintlock rifles) and possibly the American Old West (wagons are used to haul supplies and the Survey Corps act as a sort of forward Cavalry element). The countryside reminds me of Europe with hills and flatland, though ""Titan"" could be taking place on an alternate Earth for all I know. Sometimes, not knowing is better.

The Characters

With the main protagonists as well as a large supporting cast, there are too many to list here. Ill only touch on a few to give an idea of the motley bunch that stands between the Titans and the annihilation of the Human race.

Eren Yeager: (Main Protagonist) What he lacks in common sense he makes up for in sheer will and determination. Mister Angst needs to calm down before he ends up very dead.

Mikasa: (Main Secondary Protagonist) Excels in fighting skills; has a single-minded death wish to act as protector to Eren.

Armin Arlert: (Main Third Protagonist) Unsure of himself yet has the keen mind to be a major tactician; if he pursues that talent he will likely come into his own, eventually.

Dot Pixis: (Secondary Character) Commander with the Garrison Corps. An older man, he knows his duty well and is a capable defender of the walls that protect his assigned city sector. Hes also a keen judge of inner character.

The Technology

Swords: Used as the primary weapon against Titans, stabbing at the weak point at the nape of the neck. The blades attach to brake/release handles that control the Maneuvering Gear.

3D Maneuver Gear: Box shaped contraptions that strap to either side of the users legs on the outside of the thighs, with sheaths for extra sword blades and mounted gas canisters. An additional box-type contraption fastens to the small of the back to expel the gas needed to get up off the ground. Grapple lines shoot out from the thigh-mounts to provide purchase to wing from one location to another.

Cannons: Located on the top of the inner and outer walls and utilized by the Stationary Garrison Corps.

Flintlock Rifles: Used sporadically, the weapons of choice seem to be swords (by the mobile defenders) and the cannons (Garrison Corps).

Ive spotted a blurb that describes Attack on Titan as Japans version of The Walking Dead. Thats really too simple an explanation for this Anime and doesnt do it justice. Yes, the Titans are creepy and zombie-like (huge, but zombie-like) and don't speak and have no purpose other than to attack constantly and have an insatiable appetite for Human meat, but thats where the similarities end. The origin of the Titans remains a mystery for now.

The animation is top notch and the action is exhilarating as the characters zip around on the Maneuvering Gear or horseback. The dialogue can be angst-o-rama at times but from what Ive gathered thats the norm for Anime.

The character motivations are explored - not deeply, unless one of the three main characters goes on an inner monologue jag - and shows that not everyone joins the Cadet Corps (and eventually the Military Police, Garrison Corps or Survey Corpsif they survive the training and encounters with Titans while defending the city.) is in it for the glory or to save Humanity or to be a hero.

Attack on Titan is recommended viewing.",1441238400,,4409,4.814569536423841
6035467,4,B00FXB8RRO,"Attack on Titan is awesome, just a little disappointed, it's kind of overpriced. Other than that, pretty cool!",1440806400,,110,5.166666666666667
6035468,5,B00FXB8RRO,"The first thing I am going to say is I watch all my Anime dubbed. Yes, this seems to be something that is extremely frowned upon. However, I honestly do not like reading subtitles nor do I like how the Japanese voice actors, act. What I mean is generally girls are very high pitched voices and guys, especially evil guys have a very low pitched voices. Which can be annoying to me. The funny thing is I can watch sub live-action movies with Japanese actors and they have these natural sounding voices and I'm fine with it. Not sure why the are natural sounding in live action but in Sub they are all exaggerated. Now I have not seen to many subbed anime's so my reference pool is pretty small.  That being said before all the dislikes on my review come streaming in. I am not hating on Subs. If you like watching Anime in its native language then by all means watch it!  At the end of the day if you like something you should enjoy it and not worry about what anyone else thinks.

Ok, lets get into this Anime shall we? Well first off I have seen a lot of dubbed anime some with what I consider good voice acting and others I consider to be bad voice acting. That being said Attack on Titan has excellent voice acting. There are not many dubbed anime that I would put in this category. A couple off the top my head would be Cowboy Bepop and Black Lagoon that are also very well done anime you should definitely check out! Attack on Titan seems to take place in the 19th century in Europe (Which is another reason why I think the dub is better). There are these giant humanoid monsters known as Titans who have  ""hunted"" humanity to near extinction. What remains of humanity are trapped behind three large walls. Wall Rose, Maria, and Sina. Now our protagonists live behind wall Maria. Lets talk about our main leads. Eren, a very head strong, passionate individual who vows to destroy all Titans. Mikasa, the adopted sister of Eren who is physically and mentally strong and who's only concern seems to be to protect Eren. Lastly, Armin, Who is highly intelligent but also the weakest of the three protagonists. This anime starts off very strong with character interaction and development. We meet our three protagonists pretty early in the series and get a feel what they are all about. Erin Idolizes the Survey Corps and hopes to join their ranks one day. Mikasa wants to keep Erin safe and therefore does not want him joining the Servery Corps. Armin gets bullied and is saved by Eren and Mikasa. However, he has a book in his hands which foreshadows his intelligence. Later a giant Titan called the ""Colossal Titan"" appears in front of Wall Maria. And kicks down the gate allowing smaller titans to get inside the wall effectively ending the 100 years of peace. This event sets in motion the start of our protagonists journey into a world of death and destruction. Without giving to much away the Anime keeps a good pace throughout and has a lot of shocking imagery. The music is incredible, Hiroyuki Sawano really brings out the emotion that we all expect from a great composer. The animation is very well done and yet different from the norm which makes it memorable. This Anime has it all and the dubbed voice actors where really able to bring out the emotion needed for this kind of anime. It really seems to me that everyone involved where very passionate about this project. The voice acting definitely reflects this. There are going to be a lot of people who say the dubbed acting sucks but I promise you, I know what bad dub acting is like and this is not it.

Buy this series or at the very least do yourself a favor and watch it. You will not be disappointed. I enjoyed every minute of this series and I am looking forward to season two in 2016.",1440460800,2,3758,4.4563953488372094

6035472,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Attack on Titan was one of the biggest surprises of my limited anime experience. At first glance its a clichd set of characters in an almost as clichd dystopian setting. I wasn't expecting much, and at first it didn't impress me as even fairly original. But this anime takes these overused ideas and completely, if subtly, breaks out of the common mold.

Meet the latest golden trio. Weve got two boys and a girl. The heros a hothead who seems to be just about the only one who can see what everyone else is doing wrong, even those much older than he; the girl is the toughest, most skilled of the three and also the least emotional; the third is the best friend of our hero and smartest of the group, and while he isn't usually of much help he occasionally comes through in such a big way that he manages to make up for all the deadweight he places on the other two.

For some people, this is enough to turn off the show only a few episodes in, but all three of these characters completely confounded my expectations for them. Despite at first seeming the righteously indignant, somewhat annoying lead of most fantasy stories, Erens anger is of such a high degree at times that he becomes too unlikeable to be that typical hero, and so, paradoxically easier to accept. Some reveals concerning his past and identity help substantiate his overreactions later, and while its not uncommon for heroes to have superhuman abilities that are dark and unpredictable, I think the melodrama that usually goes hand and hand with these is downplayed considerably. Eren is always changing and learning and I felt that while he may have some clichd characteristics, I was really able to appreciate his growth as a person. Often he demonstrates a level of maturity I wouldnt have given him credit for.

Mikasa is the strong female lead. There was not a reveal of some kind of weakness in her that made her more fallible. Despite the fact that many female characters are presented as too perfect and overly superior to the boys, there are quite a few Ive found recently that have managed to portray a more human female character. So while for Attack on Titan to do so would certainly be welcome, it actually wouldnt be so incredibly revolutionary as I might have thought a couple of years ago. No, Mikasa does not succumb to some great weakness; rather, I was utterly amazed by her response to the loss of what, until that point, I understood to be the most important thing in her life. While in definite and later obvious pain, her life evidently does not utterly depend on one thing, and for her to find the courage to keep moving even in the face of her worst nightmare is what makes her a truly strong character.

Finally, Armin, the ingenious but cowardly best friend. I think a majority of the viewers will be waiting, like I was, for Armin to be faced with a situation so horrible and endangering to his friends that he finally manages to screw up his courage and do something; isn't that the way it always goes? However, once again, I was surprised. For some time, Armin remains terror-stricken to the point of inaction and, in my opinion, accurately portraying how a majority of us would be under his circumstances. What actually enables him to face his fears and do what needs to be done is actually a realization that he already has saved his friends in the past and that they have recognized it for some time.

True, some of the secondary characters are a little less developed and I found myself forgetting who they were often enough, but I think the three leads make up for it.

Perhaps the thing I appreciated the most about this series is that it actually made me think. The first inkling of intelligence is in a heated conversation in the very first scene, and from there it only gets better. Despite coming off as an action-packed, semi-horror thriller, there were so many things to think about and I sometimes had jaw-dropping realizations similar to the ones I experienced when watching Kinos Journey.

Not only this, but while there certainly is a heavy amount of violence, some of it quite horrifying, the series still manages to be sensitive to every human reaction to these horrors, and because of the apocalyptic scenario of the story, it didn't usually seem overly gratuitous.

I have the feeling that someday people might view the animation in this series the same way they do that of Ralph Bakshis The Lord of the Rings. That 1980 film is a personal favorite of mine, but it uses an odd mixture of standard animation and rotoscoped live-action footage. While the techniques used were revolutionary for the time, it doesnt change the fact that it sometimes looks downright odd what with the mishmash of styles shown even in some of the same scenes.

Similarly, much of the animation of Attack on Titan does not really match. The characters are unnaturally shiny, especially in the eyes, and are outlined in thick black lines, while the titans have the realest, mottled look. I personally enjoyed how incredibly unique the art-style was, and while the characters expressions are occasionally a little wooden because of their rigid faces, the titans expressions are incredibly human and you get the feeling that youve seen them all before. Not only this but the scenery is beautiful and crystal clear.

The music does not have many very distinguishable themes. In fact, some of it sounded very similar to other soundtracks Id heard before. But it is really versatile, with symphonic pieces complete with epic-sounding choirs, some more cool rock themes, and even the occasional melancholy piano solo. Every bit of it is put in exactly the right places, effectively helping to set the tone for each scene while remaining unobtrusive. Plus, it is pretty enjoyable to listen to on its own.

In short, Attack on Titan really is something of an anomaly because it makes its own style and finds completely new ways to work with and transform all-to-common story elements.",1439769600,,5974,4.712643678160919

The scenes are mostly static, framing almost non-existent, storyline jumbled and out of sequence. Instead of Attack on Titan it should be called ""Talking on Titan"", as it's scene after scene of dialogue the sum of which is as original as an 80's sitcom. And the dialogue is extremely repetitive. So many characters have similar spoken voices, identical delivery and presentation, similar faces, similar character traits, it's a big bowl of bland mush. Oh and the whining and crying is almost nonstop. Basically this is a show about emotional teenagers expressing their self doubts, self loathing, jealousies, fears, and grief; over and over and over and over and over in nearly static images. There is very little action, maybe 1-2 minutes worth in an episode. It does get better around episode 14, if you can stand it that long.",1426464000,2,959,4.925925925925926

This was a massive disappointment, as I didn't really care for the dubbing/voice acting done for the English audio on this anime, but it was bearable and the Marathon Mode was a very welcome feature.  This anime looks absolutely stunning on Blu-Ray in 1080p, even more so than I thought it looked on Netflix for sure.  The case is good quality and the disks are all secure and the artwork is nice.  This is still worth it, but be aware that the Japanese audio and the English subtitles are not on the Blu-Ray disks, they are, however, on the DVD disks of the show, which makes no sense to me, but that's a question for Funimation.

6035539,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Just finished watching ""Attack on Titan - Part One"" released by Funimation.
Jeff H. got me ""Attack on Titan - Part One"" as one of my Channukah presents.
""Attack on Titan"" is perhaps simply one of the best anime series I've seen in a long time.
Set in an unspeficied future time, ""Attack on Titan"" envisions a world where Humanity exists behind three walled enclaves and hovers near the brink of extinction due to the existence of Titans - seemingly mindless meters tall human like creatures whose sole purpose is to eat humans.
SPOILER ALERT - this is a rather graphically violent  anime series on the Dawn of the Dead scale.
Growing up in this rather dismal future is Eren Jager.  He's a young boy when an armored Titan demolishes the gate leading out to the outside world and brings in an onslaught of hungry Titans - who are lured by the presence of humans.
One interesting note on about Titans - they have no inante intellegence and are drawn to humans by animal instinct.
Eren survives the attack, only to have to watch in horror as his mother is eaten alive by a Titan.
Eren, and his friends,  enlist in the military cadet traning program.  Eren's goal is simple - become a member of the Survey Team Corps and kill every Titan alive to avenge his mother's death.
Yet there is just a hint of a conspiracy against  Eren.  His equipment is tampered with - almost causing him to be washed out of the military. And at the end of Part One, Eren discovers by accident that he has the ability to turn into a Titan, which hints that others might have the same ability to.
But Eren isn't accepted or welcomed as Humanity's potential savior.
GREAT ANIME FUN!
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

It came with both the DVDs and the BluRays which is always nice since I prefer watching things on my laptop. The special features were fantastic; textless theme and ending song, this mini chibi video, commentary with the cast, and more.
Review on the Anime (Spoiler Free): First thing's first; if you don't like gore and voilence, skip this one. If you're okay with it, give this anime a shot! I watched all 24 episodes with subtitles online. I loved it and decided to buy it on DVD. I don't usually go for dut I gotta say I like this. I was hoping they wouldn't mess up Armin since he was my favorite and they didn't. Levi, Mikasa, and Annie were fantastic, the only complaint I have is Eren, who just didn't feel right for this part. The story is about the Titans, who have a taste for human flesh. Because of that, humanity made these walls to protect themselves but the Titans are back and humanity is fighting for survival. I won't go too into the characters because it's better to go in not knowing too much. It's been a long time since an anime has been able to keep me on the edge of my seat, there aren't many shows that have had this much of an impact on me.

6035554,5,B00FXB8RRO,"As someone who has been a lifetime fan of Anime since I first saw Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D & Ninja Scroll when I was a young greasy pre teen many moons ago, I consider myself a pretty good judge of the subject matter. I can honestly say that this first season of Attack on Titan lives up to the hype I had heard about it for all these many months. All the usual elements line up as predicted. The plucky kid that is all starry eyed and full of bravado. The quiet strong silent most of the time back-up/ possible romantic heroine. The picked on kid that just happens to be a tactical genius. (INSERT the various other cliches characters as well)

Needless to say I was a bit cynical going in but, as I kept watching and really got into it, this show has almost as much heart & soul as my beloved Naruto (my current fav since 2004) I am really looking forward to season 2 to learn more about the back story of these interesting players in this excellent world. The opening sequence really gets your heart rate going once you have watched a few episodes and get to see exactly what these people are going through. The Titians themselves appear kind of stupid and harmless......at first until you see the shear raw power and put yourself in the character's position's as they face these truly scary foes. Then when you add in the Colossal and Armored well the potential outcome does indeed look bleak for humanity.",1420070400,,1426,4.401515151515151

6035558,4,B00FXB8RRO,"I found myself loving this series and yet frustrated with it a lot.  It is packed full of action and is exciting throughout.  I have to recommend this series, though I caveat my recommendation with the following issues.  My comments are for the english-sub.

The action, great at is, is broken up at the most annoying moments as a given character goes into an emotional crisis at the oddest moments; sometimes allowing the opponent a second chance.  Now a few of these crisis moments might be fine, but there are so many it begins to be exceedingly annoying. Certainly its intended to highlight the pain and struggle of the characters, but I began to feel the characters were extremely bi-polar, flipping from one moment of victorious elation at one thought, to a wide-eyed emotional breakdown where the character is unable to function, five seconds later (literally); and I started predicting the flip-flop.

How much does this happen you might ask.  Well, at times it almost feels like the plot is crawling ahead because half of the episode is made up of emotional crisis moments.  As such the plot is full of action and excitement, but doesn't progress very fast.  Sure, its exciting enough that you want to see it one episode after the next.  But that is also a factor, in my opinion, of how long it takes to get through a segment of story.  Any positive emotions seem limited to one or two characters, so its hard to build a strong attachment to any one character; the only emotions are ones of extreme duress.

There is a lot of blood and death in this series.  If you don't like that, avoid at all cost.  The head-count is extremely high in this one... way high.
I don't remember what the rating was, but I would NOT suggest this for kids... it's nightmare material for sure.

Despite the frustrations, I liked this series, and recommend it, with the caveats mentioned above.",1419638400,,1882,4.66060606060606

6035567,3,B00FXB8RRO,"This review will cover the entire series, not just Part 1.
Attack on Titan, a show which came in 2013 and blew up the anime fandom. It is hailed as one of the best anime of all time and held a lot of hype. Even non-anime fans have probably heard of this anime. It aired on Toonami, where even casual anime watchers could find it easily. If you're an anime fan, there's no doubt you've heard it. Was the hype worth it?
No.
First off, the pacing is atrocious because it is slow.
Very slow.
DANGEROUSLY slow. (Okay, I may be exaggerating here but still.)
Episodes 10-15 are easily the worst, with how slow it is and how it progresses the plot very little.
I think I've said enough there, let us get to the characters.
The characters are pretty bad. First off, there is Eren, who is an angsty teenager who wants to avenge his mother's death. This character is so one-dimensional and embarrasses himself a lot. The other main character, Mikasa, is a Mary Sue. She is held up as perfect and can do anything. Whenever Eren messes up (which is a lot), Mikasa comes in at the PERFECT moment to save the day! If you couldn't tell already, those two are stereotypes. The hot-headed main character, side by side with the cool girl who is perfect! Oh, and the smart side character (Armin)! The deaths of certain characters are badly planned out. You see some guy with only 5 minutes of screen time prior get killed, and you're expected to be terribly sad for them. Overall, the characters are just bad.

Third, the story/plot. This could have been a great story, but the direction it took was terrible.  Like I said earlier, the pacing is terrible. Did I mention that the first 5 minutes of an episode is recapping the previous one? Well, now I am. The story is cliched. Each episode is regurgitating the same information 1/4 of the time.
Fourth, the soundtrack. This is actually a good one. Its OST fits in the moments its used. The opening(s) and ending(s) are fairly good too.
Fifth, the animation. Not much to say here except that it is pretty good. It is a pretty original animation style.
Overall, the anime gets a 5/10, mainly because I did enjoy it at some parts, but most of the time, no. This might be something you recommend to someone just getting into anime, but beyond that, no. I'll list this as a 3/5 on the _/5 scale.",1418256000,2,2321,4.433255269320843

The package has a 22 page booklet containing artwork, short comics, and character bios.  The LE comes with a holographic pencil board as well (this features the same artwork used on the cover).

My only gripe about this set is that the booklet is built into the package and not removable.

6035581,1,B00FXB8RRO,"* Spoiler alert *

I'm probably going to draw a lot of ire for this, but I really hated this show. Yes, it's fantasy and all fantasy requires a boat-load of suspension of disbelief, but most have better internal logic. The giants have absurdly broad defenses and specific weaknesses. They can regenerate any injury, including complete decapitation, in minutes, unless they're hit in the back of the neck. (To make it clear, severing a titan's head from the front does nothing but knock them down for a few minutes. From the back, it kills them. This happens in the show.)

Somehow the ancestors of the characters managed to construct not one, but three, stone walls, 50 meters high, around their entire country while the titans were appearing. That's a hell of a lot of stone. Did they summon it magically? How'd they keep the titans off their workers? How'd they manage the whole project in less than a century using pre-industrial technology? (I have the ugly feeling that the answer will involve wide-spread use of titan bodies that somehow modern humans have completely forgotten about.)

Then, again, the weapons the characters use are ludicrous. Instead of the many gunpowder weapons they have available (which if nothing else give you range on the enemy), they use big paper knives and pneumatic cable-throwers that let them fly around like spider-man. Only once does anyone think to blind a titan with muskets. You'd think that blinding would make any tactic easier. It sure wouldn't require much training.

All right. I resolved to accept all that and enjoy the show anyway, but I just can't do it. The main characters all spend several episodes, spanning two years, in training to kill titans. *Two years of training.* What happens when they encounter the enemy? Almost all of them lose their heads on first contact with a titan. I know that people lose it in combat, but that many? Seriously? What the hell kind of military training is that? And way too much of the show is spent, not in combat, but on the characters agonizing over their horrible experiences and dead comrades. This is the whiniest bunch of soldiers I've ever seen. They make the extras in The Mole People look like Spartan elites.

In the first attack, the only cannons used were set up... wait for it... in the street in front of one of two exits from the sector. Apparently no one thought to use the cannons conspicuously available on top of the walls. However it's not as bad as you might think, because none of the populous attempted to use that gate. They all tried to pack into the two small ferries that comprised the other exit. Not surprisingly, it didn't turn out well.

The internal logic of this show is non-existent, and there's more melodramatic screaming than any actor has a right to. Fortunately, I watched someone else's copy before I bought it.",1415318400,7,2843,4.7682926829268295

6035586,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Should you believe the hype?  I've been watching anime for over 20 years... and yes, you should.  Attack on Titan is not for everyone and it has its flaws.  I'll start with those flaws so you can at least elevate my review above drooling fan boy.

The line art around the contours of the characters is thick; like they were outlined by a magic marker.  Their face shadowing is inconsistent at times, placing a glow under their chin when the sun is above.  The characters drown themselves in inner monologues (a lot) that regurgitate old info destroying the pace of the show so much that it snaps the back of the action and punishes the viewer for getting excited.  Special, epic moments are scored to theatrical J-Pop which pulls the viewer out of a world they were just immersed in.  That is all.  The rest... achieves exactly what it sets out to.

The story places humanity down a tier in the food chain.  Protected behind three walls, they are permitted the luxury of being a society retaining laws and morals.  When any member of the higher food chain get's in though, social Darwinism takes over and its survival of the fittest.  Hanging on to civilization, hope, and those close to them become a losing battle, but still a battle that must be won.

The plot slows at times and it seems like we shouldnt be forced to hear what every minor character has to say, but as time goes on you realize there are no minor characters.  Once you're deep enough into the story and their world, it starts to feel akin to Game of Thrones were every character is fleshed out and not a single one of them is safe.  Anyone can die in here and they do.

The battle animation incorporates CG masterfully and raises the bar yet again for what an animated series can look like.  The sound track echoes Germanic choirs and drives the show.  Despite the gravity of affairs and the grimness, theres actually a lot of well placed comedy as well.

Every now and then a show comes a long thats an event and large communities share in it; Sopranos, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Hell the Super Bowl.  Attack on Titan is an ongoing event that multiple countries share in.  Join the craze.  When someone says Levi on the street you won't be thinking about jeans anymore.

Thank you!",1412726400,,112,4.65
6035601,5,B00FXB8RRO,"When I first heard about this, I was skeptical.  I heard there was a lot of hype and that people were saying ""greatest anime of 2013"" or ""all time"".  For me this meant either one of two things:

1) The hype is well deserved.
OR
2) This was some Dragon Ball Z type anime (which I hate) that has no real story or characterization.

I decided to watch the first four episodes on You Tube and found them interesting.  I have to say I was still reluctant due to reviews saying that it was not meant for people with weak stomachs.  After a few more reviews and checking over scenes on You Tube, I decided to take a chance and buy it.  Was it worth it....I think the rating I gave it tells you.

This is a anime meant for the classics. Its not perfect, but its shortcomings are easily overlooked when you take the whole series in.  I literally watched this entire box set from start to finish (sometimes replaying scenes that were fun to watch) in one night.  Six plus hours total!.  The story will simply draw you in and end each episode ends on a cliffhanger.

A little warning, this show is ""messy"", as in some bloody violence (people being eaten).  Fortunately, it was not at the level I thought it would be.  The best way to describe it is if you can handle some of the bloody scenes in Fullmetal Alchemist (the original), this one should be around the same level more or less.  But those Titans are freaky, especially the one with the big grins etched on their face.  To seem them cut down was always a joy (especially the ones that die with a smile on their face.  REALLY FREAKY).

The only thing I regret is that I did not get the second half of the series when i got the first half.  This is a good series and has earned the hype.",1412380800,5,1732,4.2097264437689965
6035602,3,B00FXB8RRO,"I'm not entirely sure what to do with this rating. Okay, here's the deal: I love the show, so I bought it. The show is a five. You should definitely watch it too. However, Funimation totally screwed the pooch on these blu rays.

Funimation has a well known reputation in the anime community of having some pretty bad subbing. Given my knowledge of the language, I've noticed it a few times, but it's never bothered me as much as while watching this show. You may think to yourself, ""Well I don't know Japanese, so I won't notice the difference."" You might not be able to notice the difference, but the show will *feel* different to you. Their translate dialogue is less dynamic and interesting as well as inaccurate. You will also certainly notice the fact that Funimation takes it upon themselves to completely rename integral pieces of the series. What has always been called 3D Maneuver gear is now, for some reason, ""Omni-Directional Mobility Gear"". Wow, that's neither easier to read or say. The Survey Corps is now the Scouting Regiment. Oh, and they changed character's names. For no reason.

It's gross. The dialogue itself also suffers, and I have noticed more lackluster translations in this than in any other series I've bought from Funimation.

The cards that are also shown before and after the commercial breaks (People who have already seen the show will recognize the ""What we can tell you so far"" heading) are... untranslated. They are left entirely in Japanese. It made me so angry the first time I watched it that I had to pause the show and fume for a moment. These card were useful and became especially pertinent during the second half of the series. There is one in particular that if it goes untranslated, every viewer will lack intensive knowledge for the story. This will affect you even if you are watching the dub.

As for the dub, I hated it. I'm not a dub fan in general though, so if you enjoy Funi dubs then you will probably be fine. But Matthew Mercer as Levi? Doing that voice? Why? I love his voice, but the choice here just doesn't fit.

The blu ray quality is gorgeous. It sounds amazing on my 5.1 surround sound. But honestly, I have a better overall experience re-watching it on Crunchyroll because their subs are more accurate, dynamic, and they don't leave anything out.

It's a real shame, and it honestly kept me from ordering the second half of the series. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Funimation makes a lot of anime available for a good price, however they have a tendency to muck things up in a big way. My recommendation to you?? Watch the dub on Crunchyroll (in glorious HD), at least the first time you watch it. At least by that point you will know how the show is supposed to feel.

... still shaking my head over ""Omni-Directional Mobility Gear.""",1412208000,2,2814,4.604790419161676

6035622,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Although this anime has been reviewed an umpteenth amount of times here on amazon, I wanted to cast my voice into the chorus of praise for this show.

As someone who has never watched anime or read manga (the closest I ever came to the genre was Pokemon Red on my Gameboy Color...), I was skeptical at what my interest-level would be when my good friend recommended it to me. I found it absolutely engrossing, engaging, expansive, imaginative and wonderfully depraved; Fortunately, Attack on Titan does not allow itself to succumb to meaningless shock value or the neanderthal-esque utilization of blood-and-guts for the sake of shock-and-awe. What is achieved, however, through this use of violence, is a highly emphatic and thematic message that communicates the toll that wars take not only on our bodies, but our consciences and emotions as well.

I was hooked from Episode 1. Very well written, well voice-acted, well-drawn, and most of all, well-directed. Such a clear sense of artistic vision (you just cannot say that for a lot of projects these days). Definitely give this show a watch on Netflix, Hulu, Funimation, or some other online streaming site before you commit the money just so you know what you're getting yourself in to.

Attack on Titan is in a word, ethralling. It just has that....something....that is hard to pinpoint but nevertheless leaves an indelible impression after only a couple episodes.

6035646,3,B00FXB8RRO,"This series is okay, but I'm just not feeling it as much as everyone else.  The animation is great, but I can't stand the characters.
  You will be hard pressed to find a bigger group of cowards, whiners and buffoons.  Most of them sit around sobbing with their face in their hands lamenting the hopelessness of everything.  Most will just stand around and watch their team mates get devoured....and do nothing.  Occasionally they grow a spine and attempt to take down a Titan, but they give up way too easily.  Then there's the ever popular deer-in-the-headlights look that nearly everyone has most of the time.  You would figure that after seeing Titans over and over again, you wouldn't have the same look of shock every time.  The worst of the worst would have to be Armin.  God, will somebody just devour this cowardly oaf and get it over with.  There are a few though that actually act like brave soldiers, like Mikasa.  Erin is okay most of the time.  He spends most of his time screaming at everyone.  In fact, there is always a lot of screaming over everything.  Maybe that's just part of the anime culture though.  That being said, the characters do improve in the later episodes and are a lot less annoying.
  The story itself is pretty darn good.  I like the mystery surrounding the Titans and the premise behind it.  That's what keeps me watching.  However, sometimes the story takes some very annoying turns.  I mean how many times do we have to be subjected to another arrest and trail of Erin?  Get over it already and move along.

The slip cover doesn't hold the Blu-ray case tightly enough and it slides out, which is only a mild annoyance, but the menus are about as bare bones as they come and the subtitles are different than what's on Netflix and I liked those better.

I have seen the entire series (thus far) on a website long before this release and the subtitles were different, having seen that version first I find I that I far prefer that as opposed to the one presented here. This is purely personal and if this is your first exposure to the series then what I just wrote shouldn't affect you, its one of my favorite shows and I am excited to finally add it to my library!

This can be pretty common to have disks out of their slots from shipping so it's not much of an issue, but the piece that holds the DVD in the slot was snapped off. Another complaint is that the ""Collectors Edition"" is completely pointless! I paid extra for a little paperback art book and a little bit of a nicer box (that shipped to me broken anyway!)

Well anyway I used some scotch tape to hold in the DVD in the slot that was broken, I just don't feel like dealing with sending it back and with customer service. I would also say to not waste your money on a CE for Attack on Titan, just get the standard edition.",1404172800,,831,3.9760479041916166

I've bought tons of items from amazon but this anime series gets me so excited my wife says I'm ridiculous. Since I first watch the English dubbed versions of season one I have not been able to stop watching it over and over and over. I have seen a lot of anime including ghost in the shell, Appleseed, Afro samurai, death note, naruto, naruto shippuden, bleach, trigun, Akira, cowboy bebop, and many many others. There is really something special about attack on Titan. From its great actions scenes to its almost heart breaking cliff hangers I just can't get enough of this awesome anime. If your a hardcore anime fan or just like a good series this is hands down the one to watch without a doubt. This is however not for young humans, the blood, and violence is on another level along with Afro samurai. The story of Erin and the scout regiment will grab you tightly and never let go. Emotionally intense and energetic anime of the century is a not to be missed, not a single minute. Buy season one then buy the clothing then watch, support, and be amazed as the creators take anime to a new level that has not been seen in years.",1403481600,,1240,4.414847161572053

The animation is wonderful, the dub is great,  however the music score leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion. I really wish they would've released more episodes than just 13, the price on this is very hefty for such a short first part... but I support anime and you should too! Second half is set to be released in September 2014 and I can't wait! They definitely leave you hanging... but this is good in my opinion as they didn't cram a great story into 13 short episodes (as I seem to be seeing a lot of lately). Well, I think you all know what it's about, titans attack what is left of the human race and we fight back. Be prepared for gory, twisted storytelling and interesting dialog coupled with vivid characters and a twisting plot. Don't take ANY characters for granted in this series!

Luckily it also comes with the  original Japanese Dub with subtitles ( the only reason its getting 2 stars).

6035749,2,B00FXB8RRO,"There are plenty of reviews for the AoT anime anywhere you wanna look, so my review is based on the value of the Limited Edition package being sold for upwards of $53-$80 versus any other home release.

It's nowhere near worth it.

To set the tone, I only purchased this set because I had pre-ordered it back when the set was first announced at $53, and by the time it was ready for release it had increased to $80. I figured there must be some reason it was that expensive, so I kept my pre-order. I actually looked online at FunImation's website, and I thought there was going to be a bunch of other extras like necklaces and pins and metal stuff. But no, there's nothing included that gives any reason to ever pay more than $30 for this set, if even that much.

With this Limited Edition package you get two dvd's and two bluray discs (each format only holding the first 13 episodes); a lenticular slip that's just the same image as the cover to the set (and not all that lenticular-y as far as the effect goes); a 12-page ""art book"" that's glued into the middle of the set that contains some character descriptions, some odd chibi-style manga panels, and a very select few cover art/splashes from the covers of the Japanese disc releases (the pages are numbered to 26, but that's counting front and back images for each page). The set itself holds the discs in a single plastic tray for each format (a dvd tray and a second bluray tray). Each disc is stacked one over the other, so in order to get to the second disc of each format you have to remove the first disc on top. The biggest flaw with this design is that the center tab holder for the top disc has nothing bracing it from behind when the second disc is taken out, and it's really hard to put the first disc back into its holder.

The disc authoring is pretty poor as well. You get the nice ""Marathon"" feature which will play all episodes back-to-back without having to see the intro or ending for each episode. But what really pisses me off is that the commercial break interlude images are not translated! There's so much information about the AoT world and how things work, yet nowhere are there subtitles or translations for these images; not even in the dam artbook! You would actually have to go to the extras section just to view them, under the ""Eyecatch Gallery,"" completely taking you out of the specific episode you're watching just to understand what's being show on screen *sigh*

None of the artwork used for the cover/interiors/rear cover are particularly special; the set is a hardbook cardboard that opens like a book; and it feels kinda flimsy when you hold it in your hand. There's no holder for the lenticular slip, so you're just gonna have to slide it into the middle of the set somewhere if you wanna keep everything all together. Amazon will even ship this to you in a padded envelope if you buy it alone, so be aware that the hardbook cardboard could be bent up and damaged by the time you get it in the mail.

Spending $50+ for a set of 13 episodes for an anime that you easily could have seen streaming online during it's first broadcast run is atrocious. Even recommending the special edition set for $50-$80 if the entire 26 episode series was offered is a big stretch. Stick to what's cheapest, get the regular edition, or wait for an all encompassing series set to be released later on because this first Limited Edition package is nowhere near worth the money it's demanding from you.",1402272000,114,3480,4.489731437598736

It is designed like a book....it is in now way completely closed like most. Think ""Death Not"" or ""Basilisk"" removed from their outer cases. Which leaves it open to dust and anything else that can get in there.
  As for myself it ""the Limited Edition"" is in no way worth it. I will end up buying the regular version too and then give this away. I was hoping it would have been the chipboard box like some many other Limited Editions ...

So crisp and the bluray looks INCREDIBLE!! Even better than streaming it in 1080p from Crunchyroll.com! I seriously can not get enough of this show. I am constantly trying to introduce it to new people. I recommend getting it. If you like anime, if you like action, if you like gore, or if you like just good entertainment in general, buy this anime! You will not be disappointed.

6035755,5,B00FXB8RRO,"TL;DR: As a person who doesn't watch subs, I'm telling you that you should watch this subbed.

Generally, I prefer to watch my anime dubbed in English as it's easier to watch a show without trying to read what they're saying at the same time. However, there was so much hype around AoT that I went ahead and watched it subbed. I was very excited to preorder this and to start watching it on Toonami, but the English translation loses SO MUCH. Seriously. The phrasing, the voices, pretty much everything is changed for the worse. I don't think I would have liked the series even remotely as much had I watched it dubbed from the beginning. It's worth the reading, seriously.",1401926400,3,673,4.56198347107438

6035758,5,B00FXB8RRO,"I received it the day of release, packaged conveniently and super-clean. Both the DVD and Blu-ray versions have been cleaned up visually, and new scenes have been added. Not ENTIRE new conversations, mind you, but little moments where they previously recycled clips over and over have been replaced with original content that had to be cut from the original version due to budget constraints.

My only disappointment is that this only has half the series (the full season is 25 episodes long, this contains the first 13). Though I understand that it's because they haven't released the dub for the second half on Toonami yet.

While both DVD and Blu-ray versions look great, the Blu-ray is the superior beast. The animation flies with such grace and purity, and the striking colors and expressions pop all the more with the enhanced visuals. Both feature the original Japanese w/English subtitles as well as the newly-appointed English dubbing. The common close-minded otaku will leave the Japanese w/English subtitles on at all times, but the English dub is actually quite good. The characters all sound their age and while certainly weaker in some of the smaller characters and moments, it's still a cut above most English dubbing works. For a more in-depth analysis of the dub and sub versions: [...]

Bonus features include a making of feature, commentary on two episodes, an art book and trailers. I highly, HIGHLY recommend to anyone who likes the show so you can own a copy all your own and to support the show even more.",1401840000,12,1528,4.9147286821705425
6035763,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Funimation certainly splurged on this Blu-ray/DVD combo. Not only are commentary episodes included (a staple of Funimation releases in recent years) but so is a 24-page booklet and a 3D art card.

While the price is steep for most families, the quality of the show more than compensates for this. Trapped in an apocalyptic nightmare with their backs against the wall, teenagers must take up arms and preserve their world from vicious titans. With non-stop action, a vividly re-imagined landscape and characters that are easy to relate to. Nor does this anime rely on tired tropes. Epic battles that span entire cities are a staple of the series, but they are never overdone.

Funimation has kept us pounding walls in frustration waiting for the latter half of Attack on Titan, but fortunately, the extra features alone are enough to keep fans satisfied and salivating while they wait for more of the Titans and those who stand against them.",1401753600,,940,4.943037974683544

6035766,5,B00FXB8RRO,"I first saw this anime with subs, last year (2013), and I was surprised by how good it was! When I first heard of Attack on Titan, I was expecting the greek titans jeje I was wrong with that, The titans are more human like, with the thirst for blood, they will eat anyone who gets in their way (or at least most of them will). The anime can get very intense at times with top notch action scenes! It does get a little slow in some episodes, but it was nothing that made me want to stop watching it. The Japanese voice acting is really good, and from what I have heard of the dubbed (about 4 episodes), it also sounds good, for those who prefer the dubbed versions. The animation is different from what I have seen before, the characters outlines are thicker than most anime, but I really like that. Character development is not great, but still good, with the main character (Eren) being sorta 1 dimensional... The anime can be really gory and brutal at times, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids...

6035777,4,B00FXB8RRO,"Attack on Titan is one of the most overhyped anime ever that's biggest complaint, for me, is that people can't shut up about it. Anywhere you go that's even vaguely anime related you're bound to find something going on related to Attack on Titan because it's an easily accessible show that many people will feel edgy for watching; when, in the end, they're watching a shounen with some splotches of blood and rampant murder to make you feel like you're watching something more adult.

The plot of Attack on Titan is very basic for a fantasy. Big, lumbering giants are attacking the fortified walls of the last bastion of humanity. Branches of military battle Paul Bunyan in an attempt to exterminate them before they exterminate humanity. When they break through one of the walls and kill countless people, Eren Jaegar, our hero, watches his mother get eaten and decides along with his adopted sister to join up with the military and fight the monsters who took away his life.

Why is this basic, you ask? Because as far as fantasy goes this is a very unrealized world. It's essentially one city and a bunch of monsters. It works because of its simplicity and pulls people in because it's easy enough for everyone to understand. Wall, bad monsters, good military, fighting!

That's not to say the plot is particularly bad in anyway. It's just very slow moving and shounen-esque. The series starts off rather strongly and goes at a decent clip but the further you go in, the more plodding it gets. Ten minute action sequences get drawn out to ridiculous lengths because of brooding characters and constant flashbacks to things that don't matter.

 That's how the action sequences mostly go. So much time is spent talking about what they will do or brooding over all the things that have happened that any excitement to be had is lost and the scenes fall flat. Watching a bunch of sword wielding Spider-Men swing around a giant nude anatomy lab model should be exciting and fun. But most of the time, there's too much going on on the sidelines and this is where you can see that this is truly a shounen.

Another major problem I had with the plot was how needlessly dark and depressing it is. Okay guys, I understand that people die in war. I also understand that titans kill a lot of people. But I don't need to see every death onscreen. It doesn't add anything. Watching hundreds of faceless people die gives the show a feeling of childish masochism and ruins any emotion the audience can get from a main character dying. ""How do we make this hardcore? Like, so hardcore people will think they're watching something more than an above average shounen?""

I know! Add so much death and destruction that just watching it and leaving with a smile on your face is a mark of your depravity. I feel like the deaths were there constantly to try to remind us that we're watching something more than what AoT actually is and because of that, the constant death and murder becomes pointlessly uninteresting. If a character like Eren or Mikasa were to die, it wouldn't really feel sad. Instead you'd say ""Yup, that's pretty clearly what's going to happen."" Death works and makes you have feels when you are attached to the character or feel bad for the circumstances of the character's death. And that rarely ever happens in Attack on Titan.

That's Attack on Titan's biggest problem: it's trying to be something it isn't.

Look at the character's to see why so many people get drawn into the series. Eren Jaegar is a typical shounen main character who is idealistic and screams a lot and also has a monster inside of him. Armin is the nerdy little guy. Mikasa is an interestingly strong female lead and I can see a lot of female fans watching the show just for the sheer number of awesome women.

And that's the accessibility. Accessible story, accessible characters, and an accessible world.

There are some minor issues. Bad writing, some head scratching areas of the plot (I understand Eren wants to save humanity and kill the titans but he sure murders thousands of innocent civilians in the final fight), long uninteresting stretches of nothing happening. The Linkin Park-esque music that punctuates dramatic scenes really messes with the tone of the scene and makes it laughable sometimes. But for all that, there is a lot of good.

  Great animation with fluid fight scenes. One of the best opening numbers of any anime ever. Some genuinely great moments. Some genuinely great characters. There are so many good things going on but there are also so many bad things that the series doesn't excel beyond the realms of above-average. I enjoyed the heck out of Attack on Titan even through all its problems and I can't wait to hear confirmation of a second season. While it doesn't have all the aspects that make an anime great, it has every aspect of a fun and entertaining anime. Some parts do drag, the tone is not the best, the characters aren't that exciting, the action is too slow, the attitude is juvenile, and the plot is weak; but man, is it fun to watch a titan punch another titan's head off and send it into a clock tower.

People who go into this expecting anything more than typical shounen fair with constant attempts to be edgy (edgy Linking Park music, edgy violence, edgy cuss words!) will be sorely disappointed. This is not the new Berserk by any means. It's a dumb shounen that's entertaining because of how dumb it is without being overbearingly dumb.

((Please understand I hate on it a lot because it deserves to be looked at objectively rather than ""Hurdurdur! Best anime ever!"" but I review it so highly for being extremely entertaining despite the flaws. It's not one of the best anime I've ever seen, but it's one of the most fun))",1399507200,5,5753,4.681188118811881

But it is more than that. It is an allegory of real life. This makes it so much more meaningful than all of the US action films combined.

It repeatedly pounds into you that
1. Life is cruel. If the Titans don't get you, corrupt military police, greedy bureaucrats, human traffickers will.
2. You can make the best plans, agonize over decisions, but in the end no one can predict the outcome.
3. Even if by some luck you come across great ability, you may not be able to control it and still get your ass kicked.
4. Worst of all, to be successful, you have to be willing to sacrifice your most valued possession, namely, your humanity.

...all true, and that's damn depressing. So don't expect to feel good after watching it.

6/2/14 Update: Just got the BD today. No complaint about the image quality or sound. I already knew the dubbing sucked, so I watched it with subtitles. .....The subs suck so bad Google Translate would have done a better job. They obviously can't afford to hire a decent translator. ""Salt is a treasure trove!"", ""Sandy snowfields!""(WTH is a sandy snowfield?), ""Stay clam[sic]!"", ""That Titan isn't acting through Eren's will!"" (meaning Eren cannot control that Titan, sheesh) .... The subs are full of broken English like this, and sometimes the translation is completely wrong. To translate ""3D maneuver gear (direct translation)"" into ""omni-directional gear"" makes no sense. It is 3D because the story specifically discussed how humans are used to moving in 2D, the 3rd dimension is hard to master.

Funimation took a lot of liberty re-writing for the dubbing, and almost all the re-writing is bad. Example 1: When Eren and Armin spoke of the outside world, they spoke of the ocean, expanses of ice, and fields of sand as things they longed to see. The dubbing added ""forest"" to the list. Bad idea! Because there are forests inside the wall, significant battles took place in one. It was a tourist's site. Eren and Armin didn't have to imagine it. Example 2: When Levi first showed up in the anime, before he killed a Titan he said ""hold still so I can get a clean cut"" because he is a clean freak. Then right afterward, he did not hesitate to hold the bloody hand of his fallen comrade, this detail showed Levi's character. But the dubbing replaced Levi's point about cleanliness with some generic macho rant, it completely weakened the story.

The original anime is a masterpiece, Funimation f***ed it up.",1398643200,13,2614,4.8
6035782,5,B00FXB8RRO,"Late last year, my 19 year-old son and 21 year-old daughter became fanatical about this show. They watched each episode as it came up for viewing and then would read each chapter as it was uploaded online.

The insisted I watch it with them, as I'd only seen bits and pieces in passing. I sat down and watched episodes one and two, the whole time thinking to myself,

""Damn this is a gloomy and dark show""

Then came episode three (cadet training) and the outlook became a bit less bleak to me. This is thanks mainly to the introduction of characters that would become my favorites so far (Jean, Connie, Sasha).

I found it amusing when I saw the little snippet about this being ""Japan's answer to The Walking Dead"". While that may be somewhat true, to a degree, I find it has more in common with one of the best series ever produced for television...""Band Of Brothers"". While it may not be WWII Europe, the show seems more about war than monsters. Each character, in the 26 episodes I've watched thus far, deals with the Titan dilema differently. Their own personal fears come into play. Not just fear of death at the hands of the Titans, but self doubt, disillusionment, personal loss, are all approached much in the same manner as Band Of Brothers. What I appreciate about this series are the more cerebral qualities which linger below the surface of some really cool action sequences. Let's face it, the Scout Regiment sequences, flying through the forest and in the villages, are thrilling and even hypnotic. The Omni Directional gear concept, while very farfetched, is also very clever and fluid looking while in use...like an aerial ballet. I wish I could get one of these rigs to get to work every day.

It's nice to know that, even at 44 years of age, you can get into something that is ""cool"" by modern standards. I've even got my wife watching it and enjoying it...although she hates the subtitles.

If nothing else, I'll buy this just to have the extras...although (like many of you have said here) I think it sucks that they aren't including all 26 episodes.",1398038400,6,2071,4.614130434782608
6035783,5,B00FXB8RRO,"From the stirring opening theme of Gurren no Yumiya through to the melancholic ending theme, if you enjoy horror mixed with fantasy (or sci-fi depending on the ultimate answer to the questions surrounding what is going on), and if you enjoy life and death battles against huge odds, this anime may be for you. It has some truly horrific events/tragedies happen to people, and prepare to see a lot of characters die. But there is also heroism, enigmas, mystery, coming-of-age, political and religious intrigues--just a lot of stuff going on.

The basic story is this: This is an age/time/place that is sorta mediealish in look (villages, horses, no cars, no planes, no guns, villages, a monarchy) where humans live behind a series of 3 surrounding walls. Within the most inner wall, the safest one, are the rich, the powerful and the Military Police. The only ones who go outside the wall regularly are the Scouting Legion--who wear their wings of freedom with pride, use 3-D maneuvering gear to fight the formidable, puzzling, and horrifying man-eating Titans. Our heroes--Eren, Armin, and Mikasa--will enter training to become Titan fighters with the legion. For Eren it will be all about revenge for the death of his mother. (This will happen in the first episode, so not much of a spoiler). This season shows their initial tragedy, flashbacks to Eren and Mikasa's difficult past, their training, and their initial battles against some expected and unexpectred foes.

Twists abound in the manga (and some in this season of the anime, too). If you haven't been ""spoiled"", you will enjoy one of the first big twists (or the first two).

The action scenes are terrific. And Col Levi is a fun character along with Hanji.

The soundtrack is just as stellar as the animation, and the characters are likeable enough (albeit a little two dimensional as there wasn't much character progression throughout the first season). However, the gruesome action, dire atmosphere, and absurd scale of every encounter more than makes up for the lack of character growth.

Very excited for the second season, and I will be purchasing the manga volumes at some point on the future (just because I love it so much).

6035803,5,B00FXB8RRO,"I realize this is supposed to be a review for Part 1, but I'm just going to post my review of the season.
I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to anime. In fact, until about a month ago, I hadn't come across any anime that I was actually a fan of. But then my brother told me to check out Attack On Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin). Well, since I'm an anime skeptic, he actually told me a few times before I decided to watch it. So I started on the first episode, and within a day I had watched the whole season. I'm very much convinced that this is the greatest anime there is. The story and action is the best I've ever seen. The emotion is second only to Puella Magi Madoka Magica (a solid anime, but lacking in action). Attack On Titan really doesn't have any perverted scenes. Out of the entire cast of characters, there's only one that acts too strange for my liking. There's only a couple chibi moments in the whole thing. And as far as filler episodes go, I guess this would be its biggest downfall. Part 2 of the season has quite a bit of downtime from the action. Although a lot of it goes into character building, they probably could have cut back a couple episodes worth of material to get the same outcome. However, that's far greater than most animes can achieve. Not to mention that the action that does take place in Part 2 is super intense.
At the moment, Attack On Titan and Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) are the only animes that I actually like, and Future Diary can't hold a candle to Attack On Titan. Attack On Titan isn't perfect, but I feel it rises far above any other anime thus far.",1393200000,13,1602,4.238562091503268

The walled cities are a delight to see, and the beautiful sky shots only manage to make everything else more terrifying, as opposed to, say, a dark and stormy sky.

But change comes in a big way and the walls are no longer enough to protect humanity. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa wittiness terrible horrors on that day and vow to join the Survey Corp and but an end to the Titan menace once and for all...

Attack on Titan is a merciless series. No one is safe from the reality that war spares none. Unlike many fighting series where you are happily secure in the knowledge that the heroes will never die, or even lose, the characters in Attack on Titan have no such magical protection. Not that the series is just filled with senseless violence. All of the violence has purpose and propels the story forward with lightning intensity. The pacing is addictive, as soon as one episode finishes you HAVE to start the next one! I made the mistake of watching the first season while the second was still airing. So I had to wait a whole 2 months to finish the series! It was rather agonizing.

The characters are surprisingly developed considering how much the series focuses on action. Not just the three main characters, but many of the supporting characters are interesting. The series uses fear to define its characters, that is, how is it that you handle your fear?

I am normally pretty neutral towards action shows. But Attack on Titan is much more than an action show. It is a study of the fear, hope, and determination of humanity. It is definitely my favorite show to air in the past couple of years.
I can't wait for the DVDs to be released so I can watch this series again!

One thing to note though: Attack on Titan is 26 episodes long (looking at Funimation's release habits, I assume this set will contain half the series), but the story doesn't end.

Well Sword Art did surprisingly good Attack On Titan did far better It did so well its last episode was shown in theaters.  And for the most part Attack on Titan deserves its success.

  By this point if you are reading reviews I assume you have read something of the premise.  Put shortly In the future the seemingly last remnants of humanity are besieged by carnivorous humanoid giants referred to as titans and the series is about the men and women charged with humanity's defense.  Ok that's not quite it but I don't want to give too much of anything away.

  The series has an atypical premise and goes about exploring it in an interesting fashion. The characters are for most part interesting and not retreads of common tropes.  The plot takes unexpected twists and does not rely on action to hold it up.  There is considerable gore but its used appropriately given the story's context the series uses the tension and sense that just about any character could die at any moment well.

  The art and design are good and the use of color especially stands out. The animation quality is somewhat back and forth like many series for the sake of budget, but when its good its really good.  And the series has become kind of famous online for having one of the best opening sequences ever.

  My only real complaints about this series are in regards to it as an adaptation.  I have been reading the comics (or Manga if your picky) since they came out a year or so back and there are some places the people adapting it could done a far better job.  The director Tetsur Araki also did the adaption of death note. And similar to that series he does a really good job most of the time but other times gets too carried away with the characters having them get to worked up for the scene they are in to the point where it becomes  over the top.  And worse he cuts scenes,  moves around other important ones which kind of changed the impact of one characters development.  And then still stretched out a filler episode or two out of nothing.

  Either way its still a very good series but the changes and a few awkward moments keep it from being perfect.",1384300800,7,2502,4.495555555555556
6035812,2,B00FXB8RRO,"As good as this anime is, I refuse to buy it for 70$ dollars. I don't mind supporting the artists/mangakas, in fact i encourage it. However 70$ dollars is way to much for me unless it was both seasons.",1384300800,25,201,4.17948717948718
6035813,5,B00FXB8RRO,"I hope this clarifies for some; this particular Part 1 is the Funimation [TBD] release.

This means it will include a Dub and Sub (unless ofc Funi for some unknowing reason decides to opt out of a dub for one of the most anticipated animes of the year). It's the US counterpart to Japan's native ""high price-multi part discs-with loads of needless extras"" type collectors set.

Of course I will update my review accordingly, but the other reviews give you all you need to know:

This is a beautifully blended 2D/CG tragic sci-fy horror with lovely music and so many powerful action sequences/jaw dropping scenes it's easy to dismiss the countless plot holes, generic anime cliches (i.e. dim-witted sometimes painful to watch main char) and repetative dialogue.",1383868800,6,760,4.968503937007874
6035814,5,B00FXB8RRO,"I'm going to say this, this has the same formula that ""Gantz"" had, fear of death, fear of losing everything. When we deal with an outstanding enemy force, which we do not know or understand, we are doomed. Our worst fears become true, almost no way out of it, except keep pushing hard, and pray for the best.

Just  a couple of people fighting for human preservation, they fight for what it's right and for what they are on Earth.

-Great storytelling, there's always action, and character's personality is quite marvelous.
-Bringing you surprises at the beggining, as well as in the end.
-If you liked the series, you must buy this set. Series like this, doesn't come very often.",1383782400,13,680,4.65
