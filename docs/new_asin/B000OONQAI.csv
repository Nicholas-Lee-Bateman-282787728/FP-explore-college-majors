2797909,4,B000OONQAI,"How does the person who wrote the amazon review not know that the ""quartet of older (and unidentified) ladies wail[ing] on what could easily pass for a lowdown, foot-stomping blues"" is Caravan? Did this person not recognize Shirley Ceasar? Please let people qualified in the various genres review them so that the customer might get accurate information with which to make an informed decision. How many more people may purchase this DVD knowing that Caravan makes an appearance?",1242777600,4,479,5.153846153846154
2797910,5,B000OONQAI,"This was just a wonderful CD. It moved me to tears. I listened to it with one of my friends, and immediately realized that I must have it. It spoke directly to my spirit. I felt as if this were my life. God is so good. In this CD we had a little of the old, a little of the new and just a whole lot of praising God. Everyone should own a copy of this CD.",1228262400,,354,3.6103896103896105
2797911,5,B000OONQAI,"I enjoyed the Celebration of Gospel 2006 DVD very much.  In the beginning I experienced some problems with watching it but through determination and prayer I was able to see the entire DVD and I have loved it.  I will be purchasing Celebration of Gospel 2007 at a more convenient time.
Thanks!",1202428800,,293,4.615384615384615
2797912,5,B000OONQAI,"I had some idea of what type of enjoyment I would receive from this CD, however, after listening for the 10th time, we were blessed beyond compare.  Hearing all of the artists who performed to the Glory of God blessed my inner man.  A friend was by on Christmas morning, and asked repeatedly where and when I could purchase a copy of this CD ASAP.  The variety and blend of worship with the spoken Word was tremendous.  What a honor to listen to repeatedly!  This was one of my best gifts to myself.",1198713600,3,499,4.32258064516129

2797914,5,B000OONQAI,"A Great show, very inspiring! I watch this show every year on BET and so glad this is now available. I love the mix of contemporary and down-home gospel music.  The reunion on stage with Shirley Ceasar and the Caravans is classic and you won't see them anywhere else.  My kids even enjoyed watching with me! Of course Kirk Franklin, Yolanda Adams and Tye Tribbett never disappoint with their energy and God-given talent!  I highly recommend this one.",1177891200,13,450,4.743589743589744

8185793,5,B000OONQAI,"I wish I could purchase every year that Steve Harvey has hosted the Celebration of Gospel.  Little Mo needs a new manager, to be able to sing like that and be a Rapper is a down right shame.  She needs a recording label, Fantasia, I love her live performances and the Caravans OMG that's classic gospel.  Shirley Cesar you can always tell whos the captain of her ship.  I love it!!
