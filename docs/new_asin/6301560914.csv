339125,5,6301560914,"This is the best Denise tape I've tried.  I wanted a strait cardio workout without grapevines, salsas and more complicated steps that frustrate me (I WILL give up). The steps are easy to follow, have a nice build up and slow down, and get your heart rate up without over doing it. As this is my 10th Denise tape, I have seen some of these moves before but this is the first time I've seen upper and lower body toning combined with aerobics simultaneously, so you there's nothing missing!  If you want something simple, fun and that saves some time, this will keep you motivated!",1101168000,8,578,4.495238095238095
339126,4,6301560914,"Well I don't know what the other person was talking about when they said it was too easy.  i started going to the gym a month ago, and when I tried to do this video today I couldn't finish it. I must be a very very beginner ;D  If you want to look cool doing a workout - I'd suggest an MTV funk workout  but if you want a damn good workout, do this.  However I gave it a high  rating because it really works you out and focuses on all your muscles.  I'm completely uncoordinated, but I found the steps easy to follow and I  can't wait to try this video again when my lung fitness is a bit better.  I  highly recommend it if you want a good no fuss workout (and can stand  denise's over-chirpiness which is kind of endearing anyway:)",959817600,10,732,4.020833333333333
339127,5,6301560914,"I started my workout video library with this tape seven years ago and had to quit using it this past spring because the tape wore out.  I could not find another copy in the stores and was thrilled to find it at amazon.com.  It is the perfect workout on the days that I can't make it to the gym. I  work out three to four days a week, and this video always makes me sweat.  The moves and rhythms are easy and every muscle is worked. Highly, highly  recommended.",942364800,36,460,4.123595505617978

7813086,2,6301560914,"Ms. Austin does a fine job, but the quality of the video is absolutely dismal.  It was dubbed in EP mode, but even for EP it is horrible.  Even my JVC 9800 deck cannot maintain tracking and the video drops in and out.  Sadly, there simply is no other source for this ancient production.",1479859200,,286,4.2592592592592595

7813091,5,6301560914,So glad I was able to find this video.  A video that is no longer available from many sources.  Thank you so much:),1335744000,,115,3.9565217391304346
7813092,4,6301560914,"This is a fun, although dated, workout video. I love the outfits and big hair! It still serves the same purpose as if it was created in 2012. High-energy for sure. Denise Austin fans will enjoy this!",1325980800,,199,4.405405405405405
7813093,5,6301560914,"This was my first Denise Austin workout tape since leaving college. I only worked out for the results in the shortest amount of time possible. Twenty years ago I wanted to eat what I wanted to eat and not have to worry about gaining weight, at 5 1/2 feet, this workout kept me between 115 and 120 size six.  It was always about muscle tone for me.  I have several other Denise Austin DVD's now, including the pregnancy workout and her boot camp workouts (I currently use the boot camp workouts, there are two 20 minute boot camps, one cardio, one muscle training and a ten minute stretch). I have tried other workout dvd's, but none gave me the results and the timeframe I needed. I love Denise's workouts because they truly work. I've always worked out, but once I get off track, I end up with gaps of 2 to 8 (eight is the longest and hopefully that won't happen again) month intervals. I'm a nutrition major so keeping fit is important to my lifestyle (kind of like the obese doctor telling you to lose weight). Trust me, Denise may take some getting use to, but do this workout for two weeks at least 4x a week and you will see results. It's not a strenuous workout (it may be for beginners) and you may think it is not working, but when you start to see the development in your muscles (not to mention the comments of ""what gym do you go to?"") you will be thankful you stuck it out. And, when you've used it as long as I had, you'll be able to repeat Denise word for word, making the workout even more fun or comical.  My only regret is that she didn't redo it in a DVD, I can no longer use my VHS version and I have yet to find anything equal to this workout. If you want to shed pounds, tighten up your calfs, thighs, buttocks, I hate stomach exercises but those too and get your cardio in, this is a great pick.",1307318400,2,1818,4.203438395415473
7813094,3,6301560914,You must be kidding! I am over 50 and I have been exercising for a year now. Thought I would try something different. Her moves are so fast that the muscles do not even get a workout. Your momentum just carries you through. I barely worked up a sweat. Some sliding moves are impossible to do on living room carpet. I will stick to Susan Powter VHS tapes. This one is going to Goodwill.,1293148800,,385,4.216216216216216
