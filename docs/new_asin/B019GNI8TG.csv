Predator or victim, no gray area, no redeeming human qualities. Zero love, zero compassion. This film reminded me of Clockwork Orange, which I still remember many many years later, because of its visceral intensity. The one star is for breathtaking views of the landscape from above, and suspense. However, these are techniques. How about applying them to an uplifting storyline? I would sleep better.
Oh, and my copy skipped--thankfullya few times in the midst of violent scenes. No need to send me a replacement: I will never ever see this film again.",1524960000,,707,5.156521739130435

8745126,4,B019GNI8TG,"In the comments by the Director of this 2014 film  just being released on DVD by Strand Releasing  which are contained in the press notes, he says that he wanted to set the crime mystery in the early 1980s so that he would have each of the police detectives, solving a crime of missing and brutally murdered young girls in a rural area, have a different ethic which it comes to solving a crime. There is the older detective who was through the war and does what needs to be done to get a confession from a suspect, and his younger partner, who is going to be a father for the first time.  I won't tell you more about the plot  after all this a mystery, and I HATE spoilers. I went in, knowing little and enjoyed it more that way.

No, this is not a huge award-winning film but it will keep you entertained with the chase scenes. There are some pretty violent scenes too. And, there is graphic nudity (violent graphic nudity).

As with all the other recent DVDs Ive watched from Strand, the English subtitles are LARGE and bright and some of the easiest to read out there. The only bonus is the theatrical Trailer.

Yes, I can recommend this to those who like gritty police dramas and don't mind subtitles. The film runs 105 minutes.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
