5215095,2,B0090SI4BA,"For about a decade now, the entire movie industry has survived by ripping of 70's hits and raping classic works of literature (don't get me started on stinking Baz Luhrmann). I just saw this advertised as ""amazing"" and the ""blockbuster hit of the summer""--it's pretty sad when a copy of a copy is the best you have to offer. After all the game play, generation cell phone has some skill at spicing-up these old classics with computer-generated special effects, but there ends their talents. I think the phones attached to their heads have rotted their brains. I'm from the generation that brought you Michael and Jason and Freddy and Pinhead and Alien and Predator and Star Wars and, yes, Planet of the Apes--the list goes on and on. There is no talent or creativity in stomping over this old ground, and apparently not much effort to do better. How can you argue when the movies still have to turn to Harrison and Sylvester and Arnold and Bruce for real talent? What happens when these whiny punks run out of 70's and 80's material to steal and rehash for easy money? I think it's time to hang up and (at least try to) create something of your own.",1404864000,3,1149,4.555555555555555
5215096,4,B0090SI4BA,"Andy Serkis is amazing. He began this franchise as Caesar in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" In addition, he was Golem in the ""Hobbit/Ring"" string, along with Professor Haddock in the ""Tin Tin"" series (the next two have been announced). As a voice actor, his job is to convey a panoply of emotions using just his eyes, his voice, and motion-capture equipment.

In this second PG-13 chapter of the ""Planet of the Apes"" prequel, we are ten years into a simian flu virus which has destroyed most of mankind. The apes live a peaceful life in the misty forests of northern California, hoping there are no human survivors. To their dismay, two dusty vehicles jostle their way through the woods, looking for a dam that includes a generator which holds the key to life in the remains of San Francisco, where many human survivors have gathered. The apes are NOT thrilled. Those of you who are familiar with San Francisco will enjoy the landmarks (not limited to the Golden Gate Bridge).

Here is part of the (huge) cast:
  * Andy Serkis (""Arthur Christmas"") is Caesar, the lab experiment grown to the Alpha male of this new generation of apes. He believes in education, peace and mercy. He has taught his fellow apes Amslan, the American sign language.
  * Jason Clarke (""The Great Gatsby"") Malcolm is the first human captured by the apes. He does NOT expect recognizable human language, a sense of justice, nor the imposing presence of a thoughtful Caesar. ""They could have killed me!""
  * Kirk Acevedo (Lots of TV) is Carver, the trigger-happy lamebrain who refuses to listen to reason and tests Caesar's resolve for nonviolence. I really liked what happened to Carver.
  * Keri Russell (""Austenland"") Ellie is a doctor who is also Malcolm's significant other. She comes along on that exploratory trek ""just in case.""
  * Gary Oldman (""RoboCop"") Dreyfus is convinced the dam will generate enough electricity for San Francisco to recuperate. He has no qualms about killing apes: ""They're animals!""
  * Karin Konoval (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") returns as Maurice, the orangutan who serves as a teacher to young apes. He emphasizes ""apes do not kill apes.""
  * Kodi Smit-McPhee (""Romeo and Juliet"" - 2013) Our youthful Alexander discovers that he and Maurice have something in common: they both love books.

Director Matt Reeves has spent a king's ransom on excellent Computer Generated Imaging; personally, I would have cut at least 30 minutes from the 130-minute running time, but the story of human bungling and its impact on an untested ape population, kept me involved to the very end. They included scenes from the first prequel in this new series, although I had to smile at that amazing battery in the abandoned video camera which still worked after 10 long years; I want one!

Those of you who are familiar with San Francisco will enjoy the landmarks (not limited to the Golden Gate Bridge). Just fast forward your DVD from Amazon if you don't care for all the CGI.",1404864000,4,2974,4.786692759295499
5215097,5,B0090SI4BA,"What an exciting and thrilling blockbuster! I was worried about this film. This was the 8th add on to the Planet of the Apes series, second to the reboots. So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise.

This isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects!

The original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate?

For me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a ""trailer"" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending.

My favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends.

This film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting.

Unlike google, amazon seems to forbid/make extremely difficult the ability to play movies on a TV through an external device. This is more of a review of amazon's services. I hope google puts out an online selling service, because I would no longer have a user for amazon.com. Their fixation on monopolizing services by gathering dependent users and REMOVING functionality for other platforms (i.e. giving users LESS choice) like Google Chromecast is one example of Amazon intentionally harming consumers.",1524355200,,646,5.046728971962617

5215328,5,B0090SI4BA,"I enjoyed this film. Parts of it seem to me to be parables, such as the destruction of most humans and the ability to speak, etc that apes acquired was the result of the misuse of science, a warning to us. Also, there were people among the apes and among the humans who wanted peace, but the opportunity failed because of a few stupid people/apes that followed a single person/ape, another warning. Even when this problem was resolved, another arose, the issue of blame and refusal to forgive. In a sense these examples are parables of what is wrong with human nature.
The second main part of the film, the first to most people, was the action. There was much of it.
I thought that Andy Serkis was great as Caesar, the leader of the apes. I was amazed how with all that was done to make him look like an ape, he and the other ""apes"" were able to express emotions in their faces and actions.",1520208000,3,890,4.335329341317365

5215658,2,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the second film in the recent Planet of the Apes reboot franchise.

The plot is set 10 years after the first film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The intelligent apes have formed a colony in the forests outside San Francisco, while humanity has been almost wiped out by an epidemic which started when the apes escaped the laboratory where mad scientists kept them prisoners. When a group of heavily armed human survivors return to SF, the stage is set for a bloody conflict. Soon, both apes and humans split into factions, for or against a war. The ape leader Caesar wants peace, while his rival Koba opts for the destruction of humanity.

Bizarrely, Koba is supposed to be a bonobo  in reality, bonobos are the most peaceful of the great apes! I wonder what prompted the scripwriter to project his hominan aggressions onto the hippie ape? And yes, Koba was the nom-de-guerre used by a certain Dzhugashvili before he became more famous as Stalin

5215706,4,B0090SI4BA,"The best thing about Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it sets up Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.  The best thing about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is that it sets up War for the Planet of the Apes.  The trilogy gets better as it goes, both story-wise and visually.  But unlike a lot of trilogy second acts, Dawn works on its own.  Its basic weakness is that what could have been a really good first contact story, a tragedy of miscommunication and mistaken assumptions, is instead a simpler, less interesting story driven by bad guys.",1511913600,2,543,4.242718446601942

5215829,5,B0090SI4BA,"Ceasar has moved into the Muir Redwood Forest outside of San Francisco.  The apes haven't seen any humans in 10 years, but it appears that more than that amount of time has passed.  The cities have fallen back to nature- vines and plants are taking over the concrete buildings and it appears that war has devastated large parts of San Fran.  We find the apes living in beautiful peace, learning how to read and write.  Maurice, the adorable Orangutan is the loving teacher who scrawls, ""Ape no kill Ape"" on the rock walls for the young pupils to learn.  All this comes to a sudden end when a group of humans bumps into a hunting party of apes and one of the people shoots an ape.  The people are looking to repair a dam that is near the ape's home but must cross their territory to get to it.  This causes instant conflict and distrust because the humans had no idea that the apes had 'evolved' to such intelligence.  The story rolls from there.  Love the CGI, makeup and special effects on this installment of Planet of the Apes.  ""Rise"" was too reminiscent of the Charlton Heston version with the hokey masks/make up and the last one looks too dependent on CGI- looking almost like a cartoon.  'Dawn' has just the right mix of technology to make the apes look real.  The storyline is tight, moved quickly and moved the heart.  You'll cheer for individuals that are apes and humans as the story teaches us about good and evil.  Andy Serkis is wonderful as Caesar- I love the technology they used to create his face- it looks just like him.  Toby Kebbell is outstanding as Koba- he's the kind of vicious we love to hate!  The movie is fun, engaging and ok for the whole family.  There's violence, but not gory and in your face.  No overt sexuality, so great for the whole family.  Not for very young children as they will be upset by the death of both apes and humans.  Young teens are fine, however.  Enjoy!",1507593600,6,1908,4.425287356321839

It really was worth it.  If we could all just get along. But humans are just chimpanzees with car keys. This movie shows it. Since we climbed down from the trees and shed the hair off our backs, we are no better than killers. And this is coming from a Marine. Sometimes there is no choice. But in the end, it is sad to see how they could have lived together and failed by treason. On both sides.

5216208,5,B0090SI4BA,"My favorite film in the rebooted Planet of the Apes series. This is close to a perfect movie. Andy Serkis' work as Caesar is unreal, with the apes standing front and center as the main characters. The CG lends a credibility to these characters that surpasses the believability of the original films' costumes and masks. The only weak participant in the film is Jason Clarke as Malcolm. While every other actor is turning in phenomenal performances, he's just...there. I don't know, his acting skills are put to shame by his co-stars. Luckily, the apes matter much more in the film, and it pays off. This is a fantastic piece of work that I recommend to anyone. I think it's much better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and fairly better than War for the Planet of the Apes. It's the best in the trilogy and deserves respect as a piece of cinema. I still love the original from 1968, it had the best twist I'd ever seen, and it's still a great movie, but I didn't feel for the characters as much as I did in Dawn.

5216293,4,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of Planet of the apes is a great followup to the surprisingly exceptional Rise of Planet of the Apes film.  The plot literally picks up right where the last movie ends and I love how the director chose to show how the virus spread around the world infecting every city and country.  The cast is excellent and the movie has a strong story and plot just like the last film.

You don't need all the World War Z gore to show how quickly a civilized society can be wiped out and be put back to the dark ages.  Caesars colony of apes is surviving and thriving in the U.S. west coast wilderness.  Just the fact that the grizzly bears have came back from extinction in California show progress somewhere.  Nature finds a way.

We are never given much knowledge of the surviving humans are they immune to the Simian Flu Virus or was it like Omega Man with Charlton Heston where a vaccine was created and the last survivors injected themselves.  You never find out the film leaves that open ended.  The majority of the surviving humans are civilians not military.  They are just trying to pick up the pieces of their lives and start anew.

What the movie focuses on is the hatred left behind for the apes like Koba who were abused by humans and unwilling to forgive them.  Koba stages a coup to rally the apes against the humans and eliminate them.  Caesar struggles to maintain control and keep the apes civilized in the face of this adversity.  The film is strongest when it comes to Caesars own son Blue Eyes where you see his thoughts on humans change as well.  The film offers you glimpses of hope with the scene of Alexander and Maurice bonding of what kind of peace there could be between the two species.  I kind of wish the film would have spent  more time on Caesar telling of his own childhood with humans he cared for and loved in the first film mainly James Francos character Will Rodman to his son Blue Eyes.  Maybe they added that in the special edition.

My only gripe with the film is how quickly Caesar recovers from a machine gun wound in less than 24hrs.  He never grimaces in pain when fighting Koba in that skyscraper high rise so you don't really buy his injury watching the film.  Caesar would be almost doubled over in pain and exhaustion from fighting Koba.  But at the end he is standing strong and tall like he never broke a sweat.  This is the only part of the film I felt they didn't get right everything else flows very well.

In the end Dawn is a very good film just like Rise.  The reimagining of the Planet of the Apes films are very well done and you will enjoy all the personalities.  I would rate the film a high 4 stars.  I still think Rise has the better story, but Dawn is a strong film keeping the franchise rolling into War the final film in the trilogy.",1501804800,,2791,4.337837837837838

5216479,5,B0090SI4BA,"I put off watching this for a long time because I felt it would be too heavy. That ended up being true but I do not regret watching it.

By heavy, I mean like Gladiator, a pretty intense movie that is very well done but takes its toll on you (because it is so well done). By contrast a light movie would be something like transformers, where you just go to see stuff blow up and don't care about any of the characters or if any of them die.

Rise was a good slower-paced lead-in to this movie. Dawn picks up two years after that with the apes minding their own business in the woods just north of San Francisco. Caesar is leading a rather large band of apes and they have their own little village with baby apes and everything. They say they haven't seen humans in a while and wonder if they are all just gone.

Of course, in the next scene, a band of humans stumble upon them and want to just take what they need. They still view the apes as ""animals"" and some even blame them for the ""Simian Flue"" that all but wiped out humanity. One human thinks that just going in and killing a village of sentient beings isn't really a cool thing to do. Despite his and Caesar's best attempts to keep things civil, conflict ensues (due to butt-heads on both sides).

Caesar is an amazing character played by amazing mo-cap actor Andy Serkis. How Serkis and Reeves can convey exactly how powerful (strong, compassionate, and intelligent) a being he is, while hardly talking is just awesome.

Side note, I just saw War last night and I cannot praise the people enough that were involved in these movies. While Rise was a fine movie, I really think that Matt Reeves really raised the bar with his two sequels.",1500422400,3,1695,4.35126582278481

5216710,3,B0090SI4BA,"My impressions upon watching this film were partly based partly on the first installment of  ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" . I usually  rate a movie as to whether I will watch it over and over  again, or watch it once and put it away. This is a one time deal for me. I give it three  solid stars for production value and acting, specifically by the Ape characters.  I found the human actors annoying at times and the human lead, the nice guy, irritating and wimpy. The story was slow and monotonous. Rise of the Planet of the apes was original and held my interest throughout. I've watched it several times and each time enjoyed it."" Dawn"" sort of moved along slowly and made me wonder if maybe they should have moved in different direction with the story line. Nothing too original. The humans being human and the Apes in turn acting as bad as humans. As with most films made today, they seem to dumb the movies down for the masses. By not making  it too complicated they fill the theaters and make their money.",1493596800,2,1015,4.343915343915344

I would love to see a third movie that gives a definitive end to this franchise.

5217474,2,B0090SI4BA,"This movie is one of the really frustrating kind in which you watch events unfolding and just think: ""are all of you retarded?""

The main plotline was structured quite badly, in which literally every negative thing that happens in the movie can be traced to a single mind-numbingly stupid person with very little purpose other than to somehow steer entire civilizations off the proverbial edge of the cliff.

It's a little too obvious that they decided ""We need a war between humans and monkeys"" and were content to steer the plot in that direction as soon as possible.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I think the setting is beautiful and I think they could have done something with it if the writing team was concerned with doing their job instead of finding ways to make the Special Effects team do theirs.

This is the first movie that I actually couldn't finish in years at least, possibly ever.",1472256000,,907,4.614906832298137

I actually enjoyed Dawn more than Rise  primarily because I'm not much of a fan of James Franco. Dawn does a great, short, neat job of laying to rest questions viewers might have about the fate of people in the first film.

Some of the characters  the idiot brutish human drone, the brutish conniving human leader (Gary Oldman, doing much the same thing he did in ""Book of Eli)   are predictable. And there are serious plot weaknesses (why do all these post-apocalyptic movies have old technology that is made to work so easily?), but 3D quality, overall acting, story, and design more than make up for it.",1468540800,,771,4.478571428571429

There were so many problems with the basic premise and timeline of when and how things occurred or worked that it really detracted from the movie. They'd talk about getting energy for this or that and you'd realize ""why couldn't they do that all along since they were only getting an energy source replacement????""

5218153,5,B0090SI4BA,"The 21st century has seen multiple film franchises rebooted.  Probably one of the best so far is the new Planet of the Apes.  The first one, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, is probably the best film so far by James Franco, was the Hollywood breakout film for Bollywood star Freida Pinto, and another epic performance by British actor Andy Serkis.  With such a great movie, the expectations for the second outing of the franchise were high, and this film met it.  Unlike the first film, which is primarily about the journey of one ape, Caesar, living among humans, this film is about the uneasy coexistence of two societies, ape and man, that degrades into an all-out war.  The movie starts out slow, with glimpses of the ape society living in the Redwood forest outside of the Bay Area of California.  Then comes a violent encounter with a group of humans that slowly escalates the violent tendencies in both the human and ape society.  The rest of the movie is a series of character studies, looking at how the proponents of peace counter the proponents of war in both the human and ape societies.  The film ends with Caesar barely holding onto power among the apes, and foreshadows the third movie as about all-out war.",1457395200,21,1221,4.62037037037037

It's a much darker and grittier movie than the first, but there's still some light heartedness and tender moments to enjoy.

There's a few too many forgettable side characters but luckily we get some very strong and memorable leads. Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, and Gary Oldman are all really great. The first act is flawless. The second is a bit slow at times and even though it's predictable, you still want to see it play out. The last half hour is nonstop action and is sure to entertain and it brings everything together with a satisfying ending. Looking forward to the next sequel.",1448582400,,761,4.7218045112781954

I always find out hard to ""believe"" Kirk Acevedo for anything other than good role as Miguel in Oz.  Similarly, Jason Clarke has yet to shake his Tommy Caffee-ness.  It was a good thing Gary a Oldman was in the film.  He is a chameleon of characters and as head of the colony, Dreyfus, he seemed to fit right in.  His paranoia persona was a boon to the part.

There are a few other human characters, but none of them are relevant at all.  There are basically four relevant ape characters (Caesar, the elderly warrior Koba, Caesar's son, and Maurice the Orang.).  The motion-capture CGI is excellent in this movie.  Sure, the characterizations are predictable as hell (ie: the bad guys are ugly, the good guys are noble etc), but hey that's American movies for you.  We all know what character is going to have what ending in the movie.  Certainly Koba is more ape than Caesar is.  Oldman's appearance amounts to a cameo.  Even though there are only five characters in the movie, the CGI more than makes up for it.  The apes riding horses?  Not so believable.

5219564,5,B0090SI4BA,"'A TREMENDOUS AND EXCITING SEQUEL'
'Caesar' and his followers have built their own compound in the forests beyond 'San Francisco' over the
past decade.
Mankind is in decline they have been ravaged by a pandemic,the cities have all but been laid to waste,
the peace between man and ape survives as long as they stay apart.
After an incident close to the Apes compound and brief meeting between Man and Ape, 'Caesar' who
understands human-kind warns 'Malcolm' (Jason Clarke) and his team to stay away from the forest where
he and his followers live.
There is an element of the Apes that crave war against their once captors, only the logic of their leader
prevents it.
The people living within the city boundary's have become desperate, they have little or no power-source,
in the forest there is a 'dam' which could generate the power they need, but will 'Caesar' permit a human
presence close by.
'Malcom' who had been in the party involved in the earlier incident seeks consultation with 'Caesar' to try
and reach an agreement to allow a small team to try and get the generator running,if an agreement can be
reached there will be no need for war, 'Caesar' cautiously agree's on the understanding that the humans do
not carry weapons.
'Caesar' (Andy Serkis) wants to give mankind a chance to co-exist but knows how frail an agreement with man
can be, he just hopes.
'Koba' (Toby Kebbell) has no trust of humans and takes it upon himself with a few others with similar views to
find a warehouse where the humans have a large stock-pile of weaponry, 'Koba' knows that it is more than
enough to wipe the Apes out if used against them.
Meanwhile back at the Dam 'Caesar' watches over the human teams progress, however because of the action
taken by 'Koba' trust is wearing thin, the prospect of war becomes even closer.
'Koba's' betrayal will change the course of history, can 'Caesar' re-take control before it's too late or has the line
already been crossed.
This is a sprawling and exciting epic that lays the grounding for what is yet to come, the film will draw you in from
the outset, with some terrific action sequences and an underlying will from both 'Caesar' and 'Malcolm' to maintain
the peace between them.
Brilliant and Eye-Popping Special Effects Throughout, a spectacle to behold indeed.

Dawn's splits it's point of view between ape and man, but humanizes the apes to a degree with story and action that lines blur.  It is not an ape homage but presents both sides with their own needs, bigotry, family and political structures.  Good action and special effects, including the apes which were far removed from the stiff latex masks  of the early films.

5219636,4,B0090SI4BA,"Like its predecessor, this newest film in the franchise also surpasses my mediocre expectations. Despite another uninspired plot which is wholly predictable, the movie succeeds on the merits of its visuals and performances. While the humans are all solid, the CGI apes are all beautiful to behold, and emote powerfully and gracefully in their various expressions and body language. The film opens with a novel look into the apes world, a wordless peak into nascent simian civilization which is far more enjoyable than the boilerplate fistfights and shootouts of the back half of the film.",1435276800,,588,5.2
5219637,2,B0090SI4BA,"I loved the originals.  Part of what was great is that it was an original idea and that humans weren't animated with CGI which made the link between the two worlds believable.

5219648,5,B0090SI4BA,"I found the talking apes hard to believe, they weren't convincing enough. I think it would have been better if the human actors had to use sign language too in order to have some continuity in the story line. I'd have to say this is my favorite primate movie of all time aside from that one where Clint Eastwood plays baseball with a monkey or something. This one had less baseball, which was fine because I didn't really anticipate a lot of baseball. If I had been I think i would have given it 4 stars. I'm curious where the monkeys got their face paint and why they found it necessary to do that.",1435017600,,599,4.2631578947368425
5219649,4,B0090SI4BA,"Went to the theater not expecting much, ""maybe a good fight scene, a lot of noise and action."" Came out stunned; at the facial expression animations, the actual content of the human AND ape characters, and the implications/messages present throughout. This movie totally blindsided me.

Much more to offer than being another monkey movie.

Andy Serkis is ""Caesar"", a genetically modified chimpanzee raised by humans. As the alpha of a group of apes infected with a brain altering chemical, they live hidden in the Redwood forests for nearly ten years as a global plague decimates mankind. As surviving humans begin to skirmish into the forest, the apes are compelled to defend their territory, leading to conflict that could change the fate of both species.

5219712,2,B0090SI4BA,"Just because the main character isn't human doesn't mean it's okay to use tired old plot clichs. Obvious betrayals, obvious weaknesses, and obvious plot developments might be brand spanking new to the ape with the stone-age mentality, but the audience for this movie is modern-day humanity. We've seen this stuff a thousand times before. I was bored the whole time because it was all so predictable. And I don't mean the ending, which had to be what it was. I mean all the tired, worn-out steps a thousand stories have taken before it. The fragile wife with the newborn was my first clue, in just the first few minutes. Well, maybe the irredeemably idiotic human with the itchy trigger finger was my first clue, and the wife and baby were just a disappointing confirmation that I wasn't watching anything more than a movie made by some guys overly thrilled with their CGI capabilities.

You want to distract me from your CGI, you need A) an actual plot, B) the Avengers, or C) lots and lots of pretty explosions. This film had none of those things. It treated me like I had never seen a movie before in my life, holding my hand through obvious developments and reveals, just in case I missed them.

And it had no explosions at all. Okay there was one, but it wasn't foreshadowed properly and it made no sense and smacked of no character development. It was stupid and doesn't count. Don't watch this one.",1434585600,,1404,4.612
5219713,5,B0090SI4BA,"We've probably all had at least one of those moments when you have nothing to do and browse the channels to see what might help you pass some time. Sometimes you find a movie and, at the end, wish you could reclaim the 2 hours of your life. I anticipated having that experience when I decided to watch a couple of minutes of Dawn of Planet of the Apes. A bit more than 2 hours later, I was left wondering why this film had absorbed my interest. Without imposing any spoilers, it is a socially relevant film that explores the misconceptions we might hold and the regrettable behaviors that might result. As the film blended great technology (as another reviewer commented, the CGI was astoundingly good), a good escape into fantasy, and a poignant message for our times, it was far more interesting than I had anticipated. I don't think we'll recall this film as one that revolutionized film, but there aren't many we remember that way. But I credit the everyone involved in this film for taking a premise that seemed contrived and dated, and turning it into a truly interesting film.",1434585600,,1083,4.616580310880829

5219833,5,B0090SI4BA,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Chimpanzees and other primates image as mischievous, comical, banana-loving cut-ups has been shattered. As recent studies have established, primates share at least 98% of our genetic code and also share humankinds penchant for killing and eating meat and violently squabbling with others for food, mates, and even territory.  Add to that the fact that the average chimp is at least five times stronger than the average man, and you realize that the post-apocalyptic simian society portrayed by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (hereafter Dawn) may not be an acid-trip fantasy at all.  It just may be an imminent terrifying reality.  Maybe those who advocate granting (or have even already granted) chimps and orangutans full-fledged protected human status should reconsider.

Dawn begins 10 years after the end of Rise of  The Planet of the Apes (hereafter Rise) after the mentally-enhanced apes led by Caesar (motion captured again by Andy Serkis) fled San Francisco to the safety of the Muir Woods (replayed in a montage at the beginning of the film).  They have established a basic treetop village society, subsist largely on deer, and, though capable of speech, mostly communicate by sign language.  An epidemic simian flu has eradicated the human race  or so the apes believe since they haven't seen a single human in 10 years.  However, when a human hunting party stumbles upon a small group of apes and one shoots and wounds an ape named Ash (Doc Shaw), the apes investigate San Franciscos semi-decayed ruins and realize a sizable group of human still survive, led by rational, conciliatory, peace-seeking leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and more impulsive, belligerent, and ape-loathing leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman).

The reason apes and men have mutually avoided each other is because San Francisco has had enough fuel supplies to support a quasi-civilized existence.  But the fuel supply will be depleted within 3 weeks and the only source of alternative power is an electric dam situated in ape territory.  Malcolm and his wife Ellie (Keri Russell) a former CDC nurse and her son by another father, the artistic Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) manage to gain an audience with the deeply distrustful Caesar to get permission to re-start the dam, which Caesar grudgingly grants, provided they finish within 3 days and bring no weapons.  Malcolm complies.

Just as the sensible, live and let live Malcolm and Caesar complement each other, vengeful, reckless Dreyfus finds a match in Koba, a confidant to Caesar, and a fiery, bitter, aggressive human-hater because of the painful experiments to which human scientists subjected him. So, paralleling Malcolms and Caesars efforts at a truce and dtente, and even Alexs literary relationship with the orangutan instructor Maurice (Karin Konoval), is Kobas efforts to prove to Caesar that the humans cannot be trusted.  And in one of his forays into the city, Koba finds just that proof  an armory stockpiled with guns, ammunition, and war machines.  Nevertheless, Caesar continues to trust Malcolm, so Koba dangerously takes control of things by first shooting and apparently killing Caesar.

He then learns to strong-arm and intimidate some followers to grab some of the guns and launch an assault at the human refuge (the former stock exchange, I think) to kill and enslave both humans and apes sympathetic to humans.  Koba then ensconces himself within a tower.  Fortunately, Koba only wounded Caesar; Malcolm and Ellie locate him and dress his injuries and help Caesars wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) recover from giving birth to Milo.  They even manage to free Kobas prisoners (both ape and human) and regroup at Caesars childhood home in Rise.  Malcolm agrees to buy Caesar time to confront Koba at the tower, but Dreyfus has installed plastic explosives within the tower.  Also, since the dam has successfully powered up, Dreyfuss gang has even managed to establish contact with the outside world  namely a military base up north ready to fly down and help.  Can Caesar reconcile with Koba and keep the fragile peace?  Or have Dreyfuss and Kobas shameful actions doomed everybody?

Dawn, in its blatant but still sober and powerfully effective way, demonstrates the chaos that ensues when anyone (human or ape) abandons reason, harmony, brotherhood and diplomacy and gets caught up in fearful, deadly intolerance.  Dawn magnifies this intolerance through its use by Dreyfus and Koba, whose fear and vengeance have caused indiscriminate death and brought them below the lowest human or ape.  In Kobas case it is even worse because, as both Rise and Dawn argue, the primates were poised to supersede and be better than the humans because, as one of Malcolms supporters comments, they combine human intelligence with their natural agility and strength that don't need energy sources and other human comforts.  Caesar thought so, too.  But with Kobas fall, Caesar grimly admits how alike humans and apes, for better and worse, really are.  So when we witness the fires, explosions, attacks, shootings, and assaults both humans and apes in Dawn commit, we might be exhilarated, but we shouldnt.  Instead, we should be sad at a mutually lost opportunity.",1433116800,,5238,5.1670616113744074

I am a huge fan of The Planet of the Apes series, and loved the flick before this one. So I waited and waited for this one and when it came to theaters we were right there to check it out. I was so happy when it turned out that I may have actually liked this one a bit more than the last, which I loved. After watching this one I cant wait for the next.

Years have passed and the virus has spread killing off most of the humans. Cesar and his tribe are still out in the woods outside of San Francisco living peacefully, until humans resurface. They are looking to get to a  dam to try and get power back to the city. The only problem is the dam is in Ape territory so a war could be on the horizon. The only hope of surpassing that outcome is to try and work out an uneasy alliance, if egos from both sides can be checked.

This is without a doubt an excellent film. From the writing to the acting to the direction and look everything works wonderfully together. This movie takes everything that worked well in the first film and upped the ante. The acting of course is wonderful and that is talking about the entire cast. The effects and soundtrack as well are perfect. Honestly I cant say enough about this flick. For special features you get all kinds of behind the scenes features and a great commentary which I loved. This is a great film and a wonderful addition to the Apes films.",1431302400,,1420,4.152727272727272

5219992,2,B0090SI4BA,"Spoiler warnings*******  Movie was very painful to watch and such a disappointment.  The sequence of events were unbelievable and the story had no real purpose either.  So the apes can talk and they come en mass early in the movie.  So at that point when they have the perfect opportunity to talk - they don't?  They just let the apes walk away with a simple exchange of ""your home and our home""?

What I really don't like is lazy story telling and to me this was very lazy story telling.  So to us humans, you would think that the armory would be the number one most important resource - because we all know that other humans would be our worst enemy.  We are our worst enemy now.  The armory would have been heavily guarded and more than likely in the middle of the compound, not guarded by a 1/4 dozen men and far from the compound.  Even if the apes could have gotten the weapons - they would need to learn and understand how to reload.  Humans that have never touched weapons would not readily know how to do that.  Yet these weapons never need reloading obviously.  And on full auto (which modern army weapons are not - they are set for a maximum of 3 round burst unless otherwise modified) they would miss a great deal. But no, these apes have really good aim, even though they are not aiming and just generally pointing at full auto.  Geez.

Even really healthy apes can't keep up with a vehicle - so follow the humans would last for maybe 1/2 mile before they lost them, see simple things like in the movie should have been thought out.  Very little was thought out is what I'm trying to say.  The director or creator or whatever decided, ok we need for this to happen how we go from A to B to C makes no difference, and it does.

The plot itself.  What about it? At least in the original series the ""Law Giver"" maintained a series of laws ""such as Ape Shall Not Kill Ape"" even when the astronauts landed thousands of years later - here that goes straight out the window.  Calling Koba ""not an ape"" makes no sense either.  Rise was a much better movie.",1431216000,,2061,4.301298701298701

Scientists are chastised for their willingness to risk a Faustian bargain in pushing biological research into forbidden areas. Character development is adequate but the plot is more than a little trite. Animal rights activists and leftists who hate European culture will revel in the stereotypes. Still it works as a rainy afternoon's entertainment that the entire family can enjoy -- from 6 to 80. Apes are portrayed as the equal of humans -- in morality and social organization as well as intelligence.

5220409,4,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes follows directly from the excellent and exciting Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  The movie, which details two cultures (the isolated but developing ape culture led by Caesar and the isolated and defensive human remnant), doesnt play nearly as much with our sympathies for any of the main characters, ape or human, like Rise did so well.  It certainly tries to, though, as the wary Caesar goes through his own family woes and suffers a political coup, but he has too much power within his own culture to generate as much sympathy as he did when he was the vulnerable victim, the displaced underdog who rose up and overcame.  In Dawn hes at the top of the food chain so to speak and while power is wrested from him temporarily he recovers it in the most human fashion of all and thus becomes more of what he never wished to be: human.  It all makes perfect lyrical and social sense but honestly its a bit disappointing and fails to satisfy especially with the fight finale that felt like pure Hollywood overkill.  The humans fare little better in generating our sympathies.  They are divided up into the liberal/ open group who are desirous of helping the apes as well as helping themselves and the conservative/ closed group who have weapons ready to blow any threat away.  The films political statements notwithstanding, Dawn does manage to capture an idealized social order within the evolving ape culture that is naively enticing, and cultural origins and history enthusiasts are likely to appreciate the thought that went into this aspect of the films story.

While still a worthy addition to the franchise with great mo-cap performances by Andy Serkis (Caesar) and maybe even moreso by Toby Kebbell (Koba, Caesars first Lieutenant) I cant help but wonder how this movie might have turned out if they removed all but perhaps one or two of the humans, putting them into the awkward position of being captured by this new society, and seeing this society develop and change by being threatened from within more than being threatened from without by the larger and specifically more aggressive human culture.  Lets face it, for those who have watched the movie, Koba may not have been completely right but his attitudes and actions toward the larger part of humanity were prescient.  Or maybe thats just me taking the apes side.",1428624000,,2360,4.776412776412776

The plot felt like it slowed or stopped altogether in a few points; it wasn't until the last 10 minutes that I did see the whole movie was about teeing up for the 3rd installment: that ape and human relationship which was so key to the success of the initial franchise, aka the Charlton Heston versions.

5220801,4,B0090SI4BA,"No question this outing in the franchise is worthy of all the praise heaped upon it in these posts, and I agree with most so I will only comment here on something technical that was very annoying.  I took this BR disc to more than one player and display thinking that the problem might be my system, but no, it followed the disc.  I found that the convergence of the subtitles was way off; my eyes/brain couldn't converge them properly and it was so bad that I wound up having to close one eye when the subtitles appeared so I could read them.  I had no problem with the 3D with the movie itself, just the subtitles.  In fact, the 3D depth was so realistic that at one scene I remember saying outloud to the others in the room, ""Damn, THIS is why I love 3D!""

Subtitles are a separate file on BluRay so it could just be that they were not authored correctly, I don't know, but it does get minus marks in the technical department for this glitch.  I have no idea if this was just a bad disc that I got or if anyone else has experienced the anomoly. Let me know if you have.

That said, it was a small negative that barely impacted the great affection I have for everything about this film -- (oops, not ""film;"" digital).",1427155200,,1219,4.206008583690987

 Set after the events of the previous film, Caesar is an intelligent ape who runs a colony out in the woods of tribal Apes living on a post apocalyptic planet Earth on the other side of the bridge away from the human being survivors.

 The two worlds interact by accident where the humans who need to make a repair on a dam accidently get caught & captured by Caesar's Ape militia team.  The worlds both go into chaos as one good scientist tries to bridge a friendship and alliance with Caesar and his Ape tribe, while an evil sinister Chimp decides to manipulate the Apes to go to war against humans with plans on world domination.

 Two thumbs up and a B+ for this version of ""Planet of the Apes"", hope to see more sequels in the future. ""Why Cornelius!""  -  ""Get off me you hairy Ape!""  - ""Damn it all to Hell!!!""  Lol",1426896000,,986,4.191489361702128

5221042,5,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). Rated PG-13. Running Time: 2 hours, 10 mins.
Directed by Matt Reeves. Written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver.
This is the eighth movie in the series.

Returning: Andy Serkis, Terry Notary, Karin Konoval.

Since the huge rampage on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Caesar let go by Will into the woods, the virus has spread around the globe. Many people have died. There has been no communication.
  It is 2026. The Apes have formed a colony in the woods. They are able to walk on two legs. They think and can learn some words. Some, like Caesar, are able to speak. Caesar has a son ""Blue Eyes"". Cornelia has a new baby boy named ""Milo"".
Maurice, the orangutan, asks Caesar if he misses humans.  It has been 10 winters now and they have not seen any humans in 2 winters. They think the humans are gone. That is about to change.

Also in the cast: Nick Thurston, Judy Greer, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Kirk Acevedo, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Keri Russell, Enrique Murciano, Lombardo Boyar.

Option of languages: English, Spanish, French. English Descriptive Audio.
Option of Subtitles: English, Spanish.

Extras: Andy Serkis: Rediscovering Caesar. Gallery. Theatrical Trailer. Sneak Peek of Exodus: Gods and Monsters (2014). Theatrical Trailers.

In-film advertising: 76 gas station.

Filmed in Campbell River, Golden Ears Provincial Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. New Orleans, Louisiana. San Francisco, California.

I really enjoyed the heart in this movie. Well written. Like the scenes where Caesar was back in the house he lived in with Will. Too bad James Franco did not make a new appearance. Did Will die from the virus or will he appear in the next movie?

5221254,5,B0090SI4BA,"As science fiction movies go, this is powerful storytelling. I was quickly caught up in the characters, both human and ape. The first film of this rebooted series told a very engaging story itself. I was very pleased that ""Dawn"" upped the ante that much more. As with the original series, this one continues to force us as people to consider our own personal moral compass in regards to how we, as a dominant species, truly would react to NOT being the dominant species. It calls into question our humanity, compassion, fears, hatred. Pretty much the same things that we question about our fellow man every day of our lives. These aren't movies about intelligent apes that threaten the existence of man....These movies are about us.",1425600000,,732,4.817460317460317

5221368,5,B0090SI4BA,"Second installment of the series and very well done. Cesar has set up his colony of apes deep in the forest outside of San Francisco while the human population has been devastated by a disease that most believe was caused by the primates. Of course they are an easy scapegoat but since no one has seen them for many years, there is no conflict. Until a team of explorers goes into the forest looking to restore the generators of a damn that will bring electricity to the people in the city. Unfortunately they come across Cesar's people and the trouble soon begins. Cesar has an affinity to the humans while some of his followers despise them because they still remember being caged and experimented on. The struggle comes from within their own as well as from the a few among the humans who want to somehow get along with the apes. Two completely different species that have so much in common yet so far apart that they will always have trouble no matter how much they want to get along. There is a battle for supremacy in both the ape colony and the human one with each blaming the other while Cesar tries desperately to hold on to his family and his rule. Even the humans have their own battle for leadership, whom ever wins will find that they have not really won at all. In all it is a very good movie and I am looking forward to seeing the 3rd installment in the Planet of the Ape series.",1425254400,,1394,4.365384615384615

I guess apes could be bratty teens, however, if I wanted to see teenage mutant ninja turtles I would have rented it.  I wanted to see some ape on human backside kicking and a decently written story. Instead I felt like I was watching ~90 minutes of demographic pandering and goofy very predicable character conflicts.

They haven't seen any humans for two years but that changes quickly. Two friends go fishing. As they are walking back they run into a single human male who panics and shoots one of the apes. More humans show up and try to ease the situation. The gunshot is heard by the apes, too, and a bunch of them show up and start shouting ""GO!"" at the humans. The humans leave but they can't stay away. They are running out of fossil fuels in what's left of San Francisco and want to repair a hydroelectric dam that is near the apes' home. Malcolm, leader of the humans, begins a tense and precarious negotiation with Caesar, leader of the apes. The humans back in Frisco want power at almost any cost (and they do have a lot of weapons); the apes in their community want nothing to do with humans. Can we all get along or will there be all out war?

The movie is very tense and exciting, filled with action and complicated themes and ideas. The apes have a law that no ape kill another ape, which of course gets broken during the course of the movie more than once to great effect. Member of both the ape and the human communities look on the others as lesser beings and as fair game. The leaders work for a more nuanced approach to the others, hoping to preserve peace and well-being for everyone involved. The moral and political tension is just as high as the action tension. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a thoughtful and exciting sequel well worth watching.",1424649600,,1688,4.341772151898734

Nonsensical slow beginning considering how much ground it tried to cover later, didn't really get a sense of how the apes got to where they were where suddenly: they have horses!  Suddenly: they're quite willing to do the Stanford experiment and jail humans!  And also: we, of course, all know stories such as ""disease wipes out most of humanity (i.e. North America)"" so we all understand the idea that there will be separate bands of humans trying to reach each other--no need to explain, just make it so.  Whatever happened to the black guy?  Suddenly the three humans we all know and love get to escape, what happened to the black guy?  Why it always gotta be the black guy who just disappears from the plot?  Why is Gary Oldman always the intense weirdo?

5222042,4,B0090SI4BA,"(This review is for the 3D version.)

I'm sure that Charlton Heston is rolling in his grave over this film.

After all, he was once the spokesman for the NRA, and he also starred in the original ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise.  So, I'm quite sure that he wouldn't appreciate a reboot of his beloved series, especially in a modern PC-mess-of-a-world.  But if a reboot must be done, he would at least argue that guns should be OK while doing it.

But for a film that is so anti-gun, it sure has guns.  Lots of them.  There are handguns, there are shotguns, and there are even machine guns.  Even the monkeys have guns.  Heck, even one ape on horseback is even a two-gun shooter!  (One of the funniest scenes in the film, by the way.)  And this is quite surprising really in one of the most liberal cities in the world, San Francisco, or ""The City"" as people like to affectionately call it here.  It's quite funny that the writer and director obviously wanted to discuss the dangers of firearms while simultaneously using them so much themselves.  I did laugh quite a bit about that hypocrisy.

But I laughed quite a bit about some other things, too.  Caeser's baby boy being born, obviously borrowing from ""The Lion King"" from a while back, and borrowing even more from the whole ""Jesus Story"" from surely a much earlier era.  And I laughed quite a bit about the whole can't-we-all-just-get-along message as well; I mean, after all, humans aren't that far removed from apes -- we sure act like them quite a bit, which ironically requires us to own handguns ourselves for protection -- so we should feel a common connection, I suppose.

But still, I guess that almost 200 million US dollars were spent creating this film, and it shows.  I recorded this off of the DirecTV 3D channel -- the only 3D channel that's left on that satellite provider, unfortunately -- and I wasn't disappointed, at least by how good it looks.  I tell you, CGI effects are becoming so good, it's getting hard to tell what is real and what is not.  It makes me think that maybe NBC doesn't have to ever bring back Brian Williams; heck, the network could just create a virtual version of him, a virtual version that doesn't lie or at least only ""bends the truth"" as he might argue.  At any rate, with this film, the 3D really adds to the experience, especially in the forest scenes.  But 3D really shines in a skyscraper scene late in the film.  I have a fear of heights, and I felt real Vertigo while watching.

Hopefully the next film in the reboot isn't so anti-gun, or at least doesn't pretend to be so anti-gun, while promoting them so much at the same time.  It's like going out for lunch with someone who says that she's a vegetarian, but then eats a chicken sandwich, arguing that ""chicken isn't really meat.""  (This is actually a true story about a truly hypocritical situation and a truly hypocritical person, so I just had to throw it in.)  And I'm sure that Mr. Heston would agree with me, if he wasn't so busy rolling in his grave.",1423958400,3,3016,4.486238532110092

5222215,5,B0090SI4BA,"When I saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes I was afraid that I would miss the tradition of humans in makeup playing the apes since I'm such a big fan of the original films but I was blown away. The performance capture really worked thanks to excellent performance by Andy Serkis and some very talent CGI artists. Seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes I was afraid that I would not like it as well as Rise but I was wrong. The thing that makes these films work is that they are written by people who have obviously taken great pains to learn about and understand ape behavior. They've also done an excellent job of walking that tight rope between instinctual behavior and the ape's recently acquired intelligence. Taking place 10 years after the first film, we see the progress of intelligent apes still struggling with what's inherent in them, how they've learned to survive as non-indigenous creatures, and the psychological effects of their past experiences with humans. We also see the angst, fear and prejudice of humans struggling to rebuild following the decimating simian flu. Is it a perfect film? No, but it is a worthy addition to the Planet of the Apes legacy.",1423094400,,1170,4.6298076923076925

5222440,5,B0090SI4BA,"The ""Monkey Planet"" series seemed to have grown into a dead-tired cultural cliche.  The original ""Planet"" - better than Pierre Boulle's meandering slapdash novel - had degenerated into a shlock genre, bottoming in the silly 70s TV series and Halloween regalia.  I expected a trashy revival, but I have to admit so far I'm wrong about these ""new apes.""  They should become the defining face of the ape saga.  (Though the debut under Charlton Heston will forever remain one of the great films, thanks to its shattering conclusion.)

In this No. 2 the apes have followed their Darwinian ascent by hunting, domesticating animals, and family collectivity.  They are also engaging in politics. Unity against an external foe clashes with personal and value dissent within the simian fold.  We see the apes living as Indian-like semi-noble savages, until seriously provoked by foreign ""discoverers.""  The apes of course possess an invaluable resource that said trespassers must have for love, money, or genocide.  The parallels are obvious and down-to-earth - none of Boulle's space and time-travel setup.  But the movie retains Boulle's sense of compassion and dignity in struggle: this is the same author, after all, who gave us ""Bridge Over the River Kwai.""

The most intriguing aspect is its portrayal of ape politics.  The wise, conflicted lover of peace and family - Chief Caesar - is challenged by the treacherous renegade Koba for ape leadership into war.  Their all-too-human descent from life-saving friendship into mutual death-hatred is gist for many a night-time college head session.  Even Koba is given his due as a victim of ""humanity"" scarred for life in body and soul.  Perhaps the screenwriters knew that this name was Stalin's original revolutionary nom-de-guerre.

I hope that in the final war for planetary supremacy, the third installment does not devolve into Ramboesque posturing - as this series is about apes evolving into men, not the reverse.",1422403200,,1963,5.184126984126984

5222466,5,B0090SI4BA,"I have to say that not a single film this year has surprised me, in a good way, as much as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.  I have nostalgic love for the original films, because I remember watching them with my father, but other than a few catch-phrases, some interesting visual choices and that nostalgic feeling, I cant say that the Apes films are really all that good, and the sequels are atrocious.  The Tim Burton reboot was disgustingly awful (and my theater memories of that debacle still make me cringe).  Then they decided to reboot this AGAIN, this time with the incredible Andy Serkis and James Franco (whos arguably incredible, too).  I was NOT about to spend money to see that movie.  I don't care who you have in front and behind that camera, I do not have a great relationship with those apes and I don't really care to try to work on it.

I divorced them as soon as I walked out of the theater on July 27th, 2001, and since then Ive moved across the country, changed my name and pretty much wiped their existence from my memory.

I hate when films I have no desire to see because Im convinced Ill hate them turn out to have great reviews and legions of fans (a lot of whom were surprised they enjoyed it) and so then Im forced tosee it for myself.

Now, I liked the reboot.  I did.  I didn't love it.  I found some of it to be reaching a bit, some of it under-thought and the conclusion to be a tad underwhelming, but overall, it was a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) step up from that Burton nightmare.  I wasn't ready to commit to anything, but I was ok with hanging out a few times.  Now that Ive seen Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Im debating a marriage proposal.

Like, Im seriously thinking about going all Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton with this franchise (I really hope you get that reference).

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes a lot of gimmicky movie plotlines and weaves them together.  We have the talking animals, the not so subtle racism subject, the post-apocalyptic world and the trope about how humans are their own worst enemy, and yet it does it so cleverly that it doesnt matter.  I ate this up.  I mean, this world created here is so rich, so vibrant, so real, so honest, so human, so believable and understandable and relatable and just authentic that you feel so IN THIS from the minute it starts.  The way that they take the prejudices of man and ape and make them two fold adds a layer of truth and honesty (no one is innocent) and the brutal climax feels so genuinely felt that it leaves the audience literally breathless.

The ensemble works very well with the material given, from the human actors to the CGI ones, with Andy Serkis taking the character of Caesar to another level, and Toby Kebbell completely owning this movie with his savage take on Koba.  Clarke anchors the film well (better than I thought Franco did), and the cast of distraught humans feels authentic, feels grounded in the material.

The film may visually thrive because of the brilliant CGI work here, but it also relies heavily on Michael Seresins astonishing cinematography.  The only other film to produce as many single shots of beauty this past year was Under the Skin.  Whether it be the apes leaping from tree to tree, or the rain drenched stampeded towards the human compound, this film is remarkably lensed.  Giancchinos score is tonally appropriate, and Matt Reeves direction is on it, point for point.

One of the best genre films to come out in a year bursting with genre films (and good ones at that), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes this franchise to a place I never thought it would go; the modern era.  For a film that is steeped in a concept we are all familiar with, whether weve seen the original films or not, this film feels as fresh and as new as they come, and the undeniably poignancy of the script never feels overbearing or tiresome but feels honest from start to finish.",1422316800,,3925,4.437935843793585

How can they fire a weapon?  Or ride a horse?  And where did they get the reigns and saddles for the horses?  It's not like they're lying all over abandoned San Francisco, nor is there material to make them, which they couldn't do even if there was, 'cause they don't have opposable thumbs!  Where'd they get hundreds of domesticated horses in the first place?

As for the humans, if they were worried about the ape army in Muir Woods, why not just block off the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge, instead of giving the apes a free pass through the obvious choke point??  And why keep the armory so far from the living area?  Why not just put all the guns and rocket launchers in the middle of the compound, away from angry apes, where they can be of some use and not fall into ape hands (that do not have opposable thumbs)??  And if you are going to put the armory far far away, why only have two people guarding the entire thing?  Two drunk idiots at that?  Two drunk idiots who KNOW the whole reason for the armory is to protect against super-intelligent hostile apes, then proceed to treat the worst one like a brain-dead carnival monkey?  At the end, why blow up the concrete tower when doing so did absolutely nothing to hurt the ape army?  And by the way, if there's a human army and soldiers coming from the north, why did it take decades to get them to help?  Seriously, the rest of civilization formed a mobile army, and no one thought about checking up on SF until they got a phone call?

5222601,5,B0090SI4BA,This sequel is better than part one. Humans are presumed dead wiped out by the virus. Ceasar and his apes live in the woods in peace and then they run into a band of humans who are trying to get power for there base. They have a truce but of course there is mistrust. Ceasar wants to believe that not all humans are bad. Koba has other ideas. Battle of who will lead the Apes and will the humans destroy them. Good action and the story has some good touching moments.

I watched it on 1.5 fast forward much of the time and didn't miss a thing except DRAMATIC PAUSES that weren't dramatic so much as ubiquitous. Extremely realistic CGI very easy to believe in the reality of the apes. Human acting fine but they were given mostly generic flimsy roles, almost like stick figure characters (as if drawn by a chimp :) ) Koba (Caesar's #2) is the real star here, his role has it all comedy, action...well, no romance but who cares? Story line could have been fully told in a half hour and would have been a great short film.",1421712000,,667,4.4227642276422765

5222727,4,B0090SI4BA,"Like its predecessor made in 2011, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) is a kind of Hollywood movie that you find pretty entertaining as long as you can suspend disbelief. A virus (the Simian Flu deadly only to human) spreads throughout the whole world exactly at the same time when the same disease makes the apes intelligent. I7m not saying this is scientifically inaccurate; I just think it is too convenient.

Once you get past that part, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes becomes interesting because of one character: Caesar (motion-captured by Andy Serkis, as great as ever), a chimpanzee and leader of the apes. Ten years have passed since the global pandemic, and when the humans are thought to be extinct, Caesar encounters Malcolm, a human asking him to give permission to repair a dam located in the woods.

Though most of the supporting characters are cardboard types, and action sequences are those of typical Hollywood blockbusters (except that participants are mostly apes), Caesar remains very interesting as a charismatic leader whose leadership is tested when he has to learn a lesson: humans are not necessarily (and not the only) enemies.",1421452800,,1157,4.9282051282051285

5222785,5,B0090SI4BA,"Best film of 2014. No question. I was not a POTA fan coming in to ""Rise"", as it was never an appealing franchise to me, but ""Rise"" captured my attention. When I read the storyline for this film (prior to its release) I wasn't convinced it would meet my expectations. However, it was the most thoughtful and intriguing script I watched on the big screen all year. It takes a lot to create a 2+ hour film, primarily CGI, that actually matters and has substance.

The only reason these films aren't winning awards is because they are wrongly billed as action movies and released in the ""blockbuster"" months of summer. I think these films deserve to be released in November/December, as serious and thoughtful dramatic films that happen to have some great SFX and a bit of action throughout.

Andy Serkis is a genius.",1421280000,2,813,4.638888888888889

5222787,3,B0090SI4BA,"This could have been so much better. Good sci-fi has to be believable, and most of this just wasn't. Anyone who has ever used an automatic weapon knows that spraying and praying with your bullets consumes vast amounts of ammo; not a single monkey had an ammo belt on. And at the rates of fire they were protraying, there ammo would have lasted about 5 seconds and they would have been out. Additionally, the humans were made out to be kind of on the dim witted side. Things like not posting guards around such high value sites such as the bridge and the armory were pretty glaring errors in the story. Man has reached the top of the food chain for a reason; were pretty smart and resilient creatures. Also, the humans would have moved the armory behing there locked gates due to it being such a high value asset. So it is the little things like this which prevented this movie from being truly great.

5223147,2,B0090SI4BA,"""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was great, especially the first half, so I had high expectations for this movie.  However, ""Dawn"" was disappointing, other than the special effects.  If you like ""action"" movies you might rate this higher (there's some shooting and explosions, etc.), but for character development and plot, this was weak.  Even the music was lacking here, compared with ""Rise"" which had great music.  With some tweaks, ""Dawn"" could have been a lot better than it is, but ultimately it came up very short, very unsatisfying for those who enjoyed ""Rise"".

For example, in this movie Koba is a main character, sometimes hero, sometimes villain - but it's not entirely clear why his villainous side seems to take over.  And Caesar's return to his former home was clumsily done, could have been a lot more interesting.  In this movie, Caesar is supposed to connect with Malcolm almost as strongly as he does with Will and Charles from the first movie, but it seems forced and less believable.  And so on.  Ultimately it's nice to see Caesar from ""Rise"" here, but it's almost like one of those ""reunion"" movies such as ""Return to Mayberry"", nice to see those old characters, but it's greatly lacking overall.  Hopefully the next of this series will be better.",1420502400,10,1270,4.811059907834101

I liked the movie but didn't think it was a fantastic story line as it was very predictable. The special effects were pretty good. Apes riding horses did crack us up but I guess that was supposed to be proof of their increasing intelligence. It'll be interesting to see if they continue this series.,1420502400,,388,4.256756756756757
5223164,5,B0090SI4BA,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Between the movie effects and the actual movie it was very enjoyable. If your really understand the point from the ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and this movie you can see the continuity. People are responsible for the mistakes that lead to the problems in the first movie and this movie continues that theme. Caesar the ape leader creates a community of other apes to do the opposite of how humans were... and yet some problems still occur.

Most of my questions about the film are ""what if"" questions.  In RISE in the back ground there is the news report about the ""the ship that left earth.""  It's referring  to Talyor leaving earth only to come by later to find earth controlled by apes.  So would the third film be Taylor returning to earth? If so how far in the future would it be?  In the original version the apes speak perfect English and wear clothes.  Would the apes of this version be that like?  Is Caesar's son in the new version Cornelius? If the film is set in San Francisco, will Taylor's ship return to SF or end up near New York? Because in the original films the apes never moved past the ""Forbidden Zone"", so is the the Golden Gate Bridge the marker for the new Forbidden Zone? If he they make a third film it will be fun to see what direction they take his story",1420243200,,958,4.140540540540541

5223445,4,B0090SI4BA,Good movie with a deeper underlying theme of good v evil. In the end it turns out the animals are just as bad as us mean old humans. Takes a little to long to get there but overall a worthwhile watch.,1420243200,,200,3.902439024390244

5223463,2,B0090SI4BA,"Just to be clear, my review is for the 3D version of this film.  It is among the very worst 3D productions I have ever seen.  Most 3D films will either create a deep rich environment, or have a spectacular scene or two.  This film did neither.  Most of the film had no 3D effects.  When they were applied they were very mediocre or poor.  Even the 3D subtitles were blurry.  It is not just that the 3D effects do not add any value to this film, it is my opinion that such week effects actually detract from the film. I would advise against purchasing a 3D version of this film.  The film itself is ok.",1420243200,2,601,4.120689655172414

I also have Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes when Ceaser was so small cute and cuddle.
It was great on this movie to see how far he came.
With his wife son, and baby.
I cried when Ceaser recognized his master in the video tape of himself with him.
In the end of this movie I wandered what was going to happen to Ceaser and his family and of the other apes.
Sure wishing there is going to be a Part 3 of these movies, That would awesome to watch!

know and understand Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes better. I recommend highly both of these movies.",1420070400,,738,3.92

I was sad about the ending even though I already knew what was going to happen but somehow I hoped we could ""all just get along""",1419984000,,305,4.016393442622951
5223686,4,B0090SI4BA,"What makes a ""B"" movie is not the budget, but how that budget is put to use. As always, this loses a star for using CGI at all. It's not that this film is bad, it's just not that good. It still gets 4 stars, (just barely), because I am a huge fan of the franchise, but really should lose one more, if not for the abuse of CGI, for the story itself. It lacks the caliber of performers and writing the franchise is so well known for. it appears to follow the Apes saga storyline pretty well, but that's about it. It's Watchable but it's difficult to accept as anything but an apocryphal chapter to the series. It certainly is NOT worth full price so I waited until it was available on Redbox.

Although the use of prosthetic make-up and well made sets and miniatures may seem archaic to some, they had a depth and warmth this film lacks. In the original series, Roddy McDowall was instantly recognizable as Roddy McDowall, and as a fine actor to boot. Moreover the performances were either that much better , or the writing was - or both, as to make this ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" pale by comparison to earlier works. It's not a bad idea here, it's the execution that is flawed.

Had the producers taken the time and made the effort to put this project together properly, it would likely have been quite a movie. As it is, it will hardly become an iconic classic the earlier Apes films are to this day.

My opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in 30 years - it's not gonna change today. If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right. For instance MUCH of the background scenery generated by CGI in this movie could have been shot against a well made backdrop, or hand drawn and painted , frame by frame.",1419984000,,2030,4.30890052356021

They didn't develop the characters well enough for me to feel emotion when good or bad things happened to them. Not sure why Gary Oldman got as much billing as he did, other than his past performances, he did fine, but was by no means a main character. He was the leader of the humans, but his interaction with the apes was minimal. Mainly, they didn't make me care about any of the characters enough to engage in what they were going through.

5223841,4,B0090SI4BA,"In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it is ten years after a pandemic disease that has nearly wiped out the human population; the apes who have survived it are drawn into battle with a group of human survivors.

Although I liked the Rise movie better than this one, I did think that this one is a good sequel with great special effects and CGI are outstanding and well done.  The apes look so real it is amazing.  The story is good but sometimes does move along a little too slowly and the movie itself is maybe a bit too long at 2 hours and 10 minutes.

This is an entertaining film to watch and if you are a film of the franchise like I am, then you will enjoy this as well.

Instead of trying to just do a simple copy of this obviously unforgettable story, this ""The Dawn of the POTA"" has gone into a new direction! The concept of making a POTA movie that takes place BEFORE the famous -the epic beginning- of the very first movie staring Charlton Heston, but, AFTER the Rise of the Planet of the apes, where Cesar leads the uprising of his abused kindred apes; this was a stroke of genius! So instead of just a ""remake"" with better cinematography, it's a whole new spin altogether! THIS POTA shows HOW the actual war started that led to the final (and unwanted) confrontation that sets the stage for the start of the whole phenomenon of this iconic film.

I agree with most reviewers that this ""chapter"" is a worthy effort by the director , cast  and storyline.  I wanted to express my view more on the technical aspects. The art direction, photography and brilliant use of CGI and motion capture is outstanding...
I viewed on a 65 "" TV screen in 3D
Not all films need 3D but it's use here demonstrates how satisfying it can be...
Anyone who appreciates the impact of 3D
films like ""Avatar"", ""Hugo"", ""Jurassic

5224144,3,B0090SI4BA,So I liked the factoring in of a pandemic as the critical factor for laying the human race low and I'm interested enough to see the next installment of the series.  The horseback riding was true to the original series concepts but it was an unexplained move of how the apes transitioned to domesticated horses and how they sustained them in what is essentially a tree fort.  I think the herd of elk at the beginning was borrowed from I Am Legend.,1419724800,2,446,4.426829268292683
5224145,5,B0090SI4BA,It got better and better. Especially since they take it more seriously as a story and brings to attention particular subjects. It was impressively done.,1419724800,,152,5.12

This sequel blends well into the time line of the first film but develops a predictable set of scenes where you can tell what is going to happen, but its talking apes with guns and still a great two hours time spent. Overall its a solid well made film that ties to certain parts of the original Planet of the Apes franchise and lays the foundation for the next film which will probably be the classic ""Planet of the Apes"" with Taylor, Dr. Zeus, Cornelius, etc.",1419724800,,549,4.392156862745098

Nonetheless, the story of this movie is developed in such a way that you are able to understand it without having to see the first one, but you'd have a greater appreciation for the storyline if you see the initial events that brought the story to the current situation.

Spoiler alert from here on: Caesar, an ape raised by a scientist and born from an ape that used to be subject to cognitive experiments for drugs to enhance brain function becomes the leader of the apes that have been exposed to the same drug (let's call it neuro enhancer). The neurologic enhancements are transferred to their descendants and the new born apes are intelligent, evolved and able to communicate. But one of the old apes that have been subject to torturous experiments in the laboratory wants revenge by subduing the human race instead of coexisting with them. This unchains a serious of events that leads to the war between the remaining humans and the intelligent apes.

At this point of the story, humans were mostly exterminated by a virus developed in the same laboratory that created the neurological enhancing medication, but the apes were immune to the virus and the medication designed to enhance human neurological capabilities backfired by becoming a lethal, self evolving, virus in the human body.",1419552000,,1566,4.796296296296297

On the deepest level it dealt with the nature of prejudice and fear. The computer graphics imaging (CGI) was vastly improved over the previous film. I found the last film somewhat disappointing because the CGI was almost cartoonish and really detracted from the story.

5224432,5,B0090SI4BA,"I will just get right to it--this is on the short list of the very best big-budget films that I have experienced the in past decade (others would include The Dark Knight and Cloud Atlas). Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an absolutely incredible film. Intense action imagery, breathtaking intimacy, very thought-provoking. The apes are very real characters, every bit as much as the humans. This is not the makeup-and-symbolism novelty of the original Planet of the Apes films (or the bizarre Tim Burton remake) but a serious scenario being played out believably from the world that we inhabit. Yes, this is science fiction and requires the viewer to accept as fictionally realistic the catalyst that set these events in motion in the previous film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. That film was a slow-burning setup; this one is the aftermath, as the flames return ten years later. The story will presumably develop more in future films, but this one is the ""hinge chapter"" and it is fantastic in both theme and execution.

For whatever reason, this film seems to have some passionate critics. To each their own. For my money, though, there is absolutely no question in my mind that this is the best of all the large-scale films of 2014. No competition. There have been several such good films this year, but this is the great one.

If you enjoy thoughtful science fiction, deep examination of humanity (and no, I am not saying that the human characters themselves are deeply-sketched on the whole; that is not the point of this film), brooding atmosphere and unforgettable imagery, then Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a rare experience. Highly recommended.",1419552000,,1662,4.8076923076923075
5224453,5,B0090SI4BA,"Better than the first film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes).
The drama here is centered on the apes due to actions of the humans as opposed to the other way around from the first film.
There are twists that work very well, and the ape-dialogue throughout with subtitles work very well--the body language communicated helps with all the emotions presented.

The landscape, cityscape, and ruinscape settings are all beautifully shot. They worked for me.

5224454,5,B0090SI4BA,"I am shocked by how good this movie is. Seriously, I went in thinking that this would be a neat little sequel to the first installment. The entirely new feel of this new Planet of the Apes universe becomes apparent within the first 10 minutes of the movie. The post-apocalyptic settings, the rugged survivalists, the very well crafted CGI-apes, the dialogue (ape language included)... all of it exceeded my expectations. I'm actually excited by the prospect of the third installment, slated for summer of 2016.",1419465600,,510,5.011764705882353

5224457,5,B0090SI4BA,"The reinventing of this cult sci-fi franchise has truly turned Planet of the Apes into a real story and character driven drama. Not to mention probably some of the most incredible special effects in the last 5 years.

We all know where this story is going to go so yes, it is very predictable. However, from beginning to end you will be completely awestruck by the brilliant story writing, character development and pretty much everything else that goes along with this film. Bringing another wonderful actor into this film in Gary Oldman was great right off the bat, but everyone else picked to play their roles did a fantastic job. That includes Andy Serkis reprising his role as the digital ape leader Caesar. What I loved the most was the communication between the apes and how their use of sign language engaged the audience with such beauty. The film portrays so many kinds of human emotions as well as makes a major statement on the topic of war. As a whole this film is fantastic.

Forget the fact that this is based in a cult classic sci-fi film, because you will never guess when it comes to this wonderful sequel as well as its predecessor. I am very excited to see if they will complete the story in a whole new way for a whole new generation because these are just flat out great movies.",1419465600,,1300,4.527659574468085

I really liked the theme and the graphics that are so well done as to making the ape creatures so believable...but there is that use of swear words and vulgarity again in the name of reality. Off goes the sound to mute. I don't mind violence so much because I know it is fake but when it comes to sex, nudity and swear words they are real and in our face....a very long time ago I used to be able to watch a movie on TV with my children or even take them to a movie, now that they have children I can no longer watch most movies with my grandchildren. I so hate what has happened to the whole Hollywood movie industry and its horrible drive towards immorality, while at the same time it's productions are of such great acting,visual talent and creativity. The fact remains that as the public at large continues to buy into and support the movies that are pre-dominantly R, PG-13 and PG rated this is never going to change! So I am relegated to Turner Classic Movies and other Old Movie Channels, and even then I have to be careful for any produced movie made after the mid 1950's. Hollywood has used the ""Boiling Frog"" method to such a successful degree that most movie goers today are immune to all the godless morality that is being promoted on the screen or for the most part these most recent generations look forward to the immorality and think of it is as great fun.",1419379200,,1505,4.359430604982206

The pandemic introduced at the end of the previous film is played out, the few humans remaining are facing an inevitable depletion of resources, and - from the look of it - only the truly ruthless and nasty survived. What starts as an expedition to check on a hydroelectric solution to the end of petroleum fuel for generators turns into The Conflict, resolution of which takes a little over 2 hours of (mostly) engaging film time.

5224791,5,B0090SI4BA,"In this prequel sequel Cesar has fully come into his power as a leader. But he is a leader in a time of peace; and war is coming; from all sides.

Although I loved much of the CGI, I had some problems with the sameness and muddiness of many of the animal crowd scenes. I don't know what it is, but computer animators still have not gotten the hang of an animal's hind legs. This is in every CGI movie I have seen. In this movie the same problem was consistent with the apes, the horses, and the wildebeests. Each time the secondary CGI animals were all the same color with not much depth and sometimes no weight. That bothered me a bit but it's a small thing.

Cesar's facial expressions however, are second to none. His face was kept recognizable from movie one to movie two. He is easily distinguishable without the directors making him white or scarred or wearing a funny hat, or any of the obvious cheap tricks so often done in movies. I found myself rooting for him despite the fact that he is fighting against us.

In this movie the apes are in transition when it comes to dress and language. It seems they take longer to begin to talk and use few words when they do. Cornelius is still a long way off.

I had to keep remembering that these movies are made with the end in mind. I asked myself if the apes are going to win. Then I remember: of course they are. After all, we are moving up to the original POTA movie which is thousands of years into the future.

I love these two movies as much as I love the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies.",1419292800,,1550,4.1879194630872485

5224848,3,B0090SI4BA,"Really good movie! I like rise of the planet of the apes better, this one has a sequel fill to it. But I must give you some history first as to why I think that. I grew up watching the 70' version of Planet of the Apes. And when Tim Burton did the 2001 version with Mark Walberg I absolutly loved it! because that one has the most Sci-Fi feel to it, and is more true to the 70's version. But I must say the  ""Rise of the Planet of Apes"" I give 5 stars to because of the great storyline and CGI is outstanding! the musical score is brillant, and I love that Jhon Lithgow is in it! it does start out slow, but really brings this new generation into the world of the Planet of the Apes. I forgot that 2001 was so long ago to our younger viewers, so to them, that version was the ""old"" one. I heard that the 2001 version never made enough at the box office to continue. (Although I waited for the sequel) they now bring out ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". Which has nothing to do with the 2001 or 70's version. But rather a new beginning, that is raw, and brings the new viewers up to speed. I really like this one too, I can't wait for the ""monkeys"" to make it to outerspace.... and I await a sequel:)",1419120000,,1237,3.967871485943775

5224973,2,B0090SI4BA,Dialog was laughable at times. The overly contrived emotional moments were predictable. The heroes and villains were boringly obvious (Gary O must have felt sick to have to say such lines). I found myself reading the news through the predictable plot moments. I love sci fy and movies of this genera so giving this two stars pains me almost as much as watching this.,1418947200,,366,4.734375

5224977,1,B0090SI4BA,"I'm sorry, I tried to like this movie but it simply did not live up to any hype or review. Bad acting and predictable writing. Apes behaving like humans, having morals and ethical codes. I mean, come on. Humans behaving like animals, it is just absurd. The fact that humans survived ten years without natural power only to depend on a water damn that just happened to be where the genetically modified apes were living and that it was in plain sight all these years is ridiculous. How did they get cigarettes after ten years of production loss. This movie is a joke with some potential at the least. This movie summed up, humans somehow survived ten years after an epidemic claims all the world human population except some communities that narrowly managed oh and animals all lived. Apes build a community very similar to that of humans except they live in trees and are learning to read and write english. humans come in contact with apes, man shoots ape, ape leader diffuses the situation and orders man back. Man decides to go to ape to ask permission to use their land to supply much needed resource to have them live, blah, blah blah.",1418947200,7,1140,4.5931372549019605

5224991,3,B0090SI4BA,"With this movie the Planet of the Apes saga is closing the subject. I do not see any reason why to make another sequel of this. Humans made the apes mentally brilliant.

5225394,3,B0090SI4BA,"I actually found this movie to be a bit disappointing. It was very slow at the beginning, and mind you I love drama and I love foreign movies so I don't mind subtitles, I just found it rather lacking in keeping me interested. I actually had to stop it and watch it the next day because I was falling asleep. I was disappointed because I actually enjoyed the first movie and a couple of the originals.
The movie starts with you seeing how a virus has swept away most of the human race. The apes who are lead by Cesar,  have all learned to sign in order to communicate. Some of the apes even talk. When humans actually arrive it's because they are looking for a way to restore power to their camp (downtown San Francisco?). The apes' community is smack in the middle of the power grid (of course).
You soon realize that there are good apes and bad apes ( hey just like humans!), and that a coup is about to go down since helping the humans is not on every apes mind.
To make a long story short, there is in fact a coup and all hell breaks loose.
What I liked about the movie was that it is actually about the apes, humans are a side note really. The humans are all pretty much caricatures and they are there to help move the ape story along and not the other way around.
What I disliked about the movie was that the CGI got worse as the movie progressed. At the start I actually found the apes very realistic, but by the end at the last battle it seemed like you were watching a video game.
I will have to admit, I had been waiting a long time to watch this movie. I wasn't able to go see it in theaters and so I had to wait for it to come out on BR, and they took a very long time to release it, so I had been anticipating for months on how superb the trailers looked and the first day of release  I went and purchased it.

It is hard to repeat that in this film because there is not much meaningful interaction from Caesar and the good humans. This is a character study showing the flaws in the personalities of Koba and the Human counterpart played by Gary Oldman,

The parallels between the humans characters and the apes are the story, it is a fun movie but it didn't touch me like the first film.

Something else that's not here are the Easter eggs like the first film had. There's no mention of the spaceship that was lost in space, That was one of the things I really liked in the first film.

There is a opening left for a sequel, I do look forward to more detail on that down the road. This is a good Saturday night fun flick. but it could have been done better.",1418688000,,820,4.27741935483871

5225478,4,B0090SI4BA,"I'm not exactly 'Rogers and Ebert'. but I know what I like and what I don't like.  Is this the best movie I ever saw?  No.  That would rate five stars and very few films qualify for that category.  Four stars came easy for this film.  It was excellent from the standpoint of story, action, and believability.  The apes were somewhat disturbingly 'human'.  There were heroes and despicable characters within the human and ape camps.  The story line shows the remnants of humanity trying to cope with shortages of everything ESPECIALLY energy.  If you've never considered life without the power grid, this will help you ponder the consequences.  Much of the story involves human attempts to restore some power.  Many of the negative attributes of humanity show up in this picture, even within the ape community.  This is a very enjoyable story and movie.  I highly recommend it for your viewing and entertainment.  The ending leaves plenty of room (and reasons) for another sequel.  Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell would be pleased to see their legacy continue.  Anyone with a taste for mild Science Fiction would like this as would anyone with a sense of actual STORY-TELLING.",1418688000,13,1178,4.903553299492386

The two leads are absolutely bland and horrible, Keri Russell and the male lead. They're basically who Hollywood calls when everyone decent has dropped out. The story was abysmal. You're lead to believe that these apes are possibly smarter than the humans, but yet, in the sequel, they're living rather primitively and even shun guns. Really? Quality wise, the film wasn't bad, but the script really needed a rewrite. The final battle scene is quite possibly the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen. If you can ignore the flaws, you may enjoy this movie. If you were ever in the military, know anything about guns or watch a lot of war movies, you will be disturbed. If the film makers wanted a certain outcome, there would have been more intelligent ways to accomplish that.

5225805,5,B0090SI4BA,"THE FILM: Not having seen any of the original 'Apes' films (even the Tim Burton remake), I really liked RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES because of its emotionally resonant story and awesome special effects. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues in the same vein, while covering different thematic territory. No new ground is broken, per se, but the manner in which it is presented and the talent involved lend it some freshness which would otherwise have been missing from what is already a really good film. DAWN takes place about 10 years after the events of RISE, when the Simian flu has killed off a large portion of the human population. The apes have migrated to the forests and started their own primitive civilization, while the humans hang on to what little they have left in the ruins of the city. With fuel about to run out, they seek to gain access to a power-generating dam, but that dam is located right in the middle of ape territory. Soon, mistrust on both sides leads to a conflict that has far-reaching consequences. One thing I noticed continually while watching this was how far special effects have come. It was only 15 years ago (or so) that we were still using people in ape suits to portray apes, but now since RISE, they are done in motion capture. They already looked really good and photorealistic in RISE, but here in DAWN they look even better. I think that Andy Serkis did some of his best work ever here, and also the actor who played Koba, Caesar's right hand ""man"" (and later, nemesis). The digital augmentation of the sets and locations was also seamless and created a world you could really believe in. Anyway, moving on to more important aspects. The human cast was all portrayed very well, the standout being Jason Clarke as Malcolm. His character is kind of a human counterpart to Caesar, in that he only wants what is best for his family, and that he is more pragmatic when it comes to certain situations. There's also Gary Oldman as Dreyfus, someone who leans more towards the confrontational side, like Koba. Even though I think his character wasn't given enough development, there was one scene which really sold you on his plight and gave the audience a potent emotional connection to him. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent. Thematically, the film deals with conflict and how we handle it, how it starts, how trust is broken. It's a very basic story, but one that should resonate with viewers of all ages. Also, with the ape culture, there's kind of Animal Farm thing going on where you have two leaders vying for the trust and respect of the people. This is replicated to a degree with the human cast, but the bulk of the movies' themes are handled when the apes are onscreen. This leads me to the only thing I can really pick on with the film: that is, while the themes are certainly important, they are handled in an overly broad and unsubtle way. The apes basically act as mouthpieces for the core ideas of the film, and at times you might be tempted to roll your eyes, but then you'll just move on because you're that absorbed in the world being created and emotionally involved with the characters. Overall, I think this represents a significant step up from the previous one, which was already very good to begin with. It's one of the best films to come out in Summer 2014, and I highly recommend that you see it.

THE EXTRAS: There's quite a few supplements to dig your teeth into. The first of these are three deleted/extended scenes with optional director's commentary. Only one of them really added anything to the story, but they were all interesting to watch. Then, there are a series of featurettes which cover every aspect of production, from development, the cast's experience and the groundbreaking special effects. What amazed me the most was just how much of the film was shot on location (about 80%), and the overall effort that went into creating a believable experience. There is also a photo gallery and a feature-length audio commentary by the director, Matt Reeves. Altogether, I thought that all of these extras were an interesting additional perspective on the making of the film, and its themes.

OVERALL: Although highly entertaining for all of the spectacular effects and the crazy action that takes place towards the end, it becomes more than a popcorn blockbuster by exploring some very human themes. To sweeten the deal, there are a number of enlightening extras that enhance the experience considerably. This Blu-ray package is a must-buy for fans of the series, and sci-fi fans in general.",1418428800,,4592,4.710199004975125

The computer animation was good.  Only the horses gave it away... once in a while.  The combination was really very good.  The story line left much to be desired, the whole good versus evil thing.  If the apes ever do become intelligent and tired of the human treatment, beware.  They are stronger, faster, more agile, and can survive where we cannot.  The whole key is intelligent development.  Very good concept, well put together, and very entertaining, just wish there had been more story, but that's a chic thing.  Definitely rent-able.",1418428800,2,784,4.664233576642336

Read the book when I was a kid , loved it- hated the movies they made with all the monkey suits and make-up!
It had to wait for CGI to be made believable I guess (like Jurassic Park), but really the writer who came up with the original story deserves some credit, don't you think?
These 2 so far are the Best Planet of the Apes films ever put out - am looking forward to the next one, but please let's NOT forget who came up with the original idea and pay some form of homage to Pierre Boulle!

5226047,4,B0090SI4BA,"Nice political subtext. The apes are the protagonists, the humans are irrelevant (the female humans, even more so, hence 1/2 a star docked). The first half of this film is mind-blowing. It's all Caesar and the apes - this is THEIR story. The second half falls into rote territory, with Koba following a familiar Hollywood arc for the antagonist (and that's where I took off another 1/2 star :) Koba starts out as a very interesting character. The part where he points to his scars and says ""Human work"" is compelling stuff. As a foil to Caesar, he's fanatastic. It's too bad the writers couldn't figure out a way to maintain his complexity and write a resolution that didn't compromise it. Sadly, they just toss all that complexity out and devolve Koba into your standard power-hungry bad guy. But these are small quibbles.

5226334,5,B0090SI4BA,"For me, I knew this sequel was a foregone conclusion after seeing the first movie.  My fear was that sequels sometimes fail to live up to the standard of the first movie.  That's not the case here.  This is not only a great sequel but, in many ways, a much better movie than the first.  In the three years since 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', Wita Digital has made huge leaps in their digital technology and this movie has an even more realistic look than the first.  It also explores more of the relationships between the apes species and the human species.  And, of course, it leaves the possibility of another movie to keep this new franchise alive.  If you are a fan of all the Planet of the Apes going back to the original in 1968, I highly recommend 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'.  Just make sure you've seen 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' first!",1418169600,,860,4.265432098765432

5226372,2,B0090SI4BA,"If you can utterly forget that the Planet of the Apes series had an actual beginning, this movie might be doable.  In the end, while the CGI really is good, without a believable STORY it all just falls flat.

Are we forgetting that the plot is moving towards a known end?  We've got to get these apes from tree-swingers to fluent English speakers sipping cognac while listening to classical music and harvesting humans like they were North Pacific salmon.

This movie moved us about an INCH towards that end.  It was utterly predictable, the whole way through, and delivered no real stand out performance that the audience could really connect with.

In the end, it's a nearly two-hour movie telling a five minute story.",1418083200,,720,4.766129032258065

It was just too late at night. From what I did see, I was impressed with the way that the actors played the apes. They did an excellent job. It's a lot different from the original Roddy McDwell Planet of the Apes, which I love, but I always kind of thought that the apes in that movie looked like Michael J.

Boring and tedious as all get-out.  A complete waste of time.  Oh, and you can tell I didn't like it...

As for the HD streaming on Amazon, the first half hour of the movie played poorly, below standard definition quality (and my speeds are very high, so there is no way it should have looked like that).  At about a half hour in, the movie finally looked like it was playing in High Definition, and stayed that way for the rest of the presentation.  The first quarter of the movie should have played much better than it did.  Perhaps Amazon should look into this, as this isn't the first time this has happened with Amazon HD streaming rentals.

In this one the apes are living in the forest and think the humans are all gone because it has been so long since they saw one.  Then a group of humans, enroute to a dam to try to restore it to working order for the electricity, meet up with a couple of apes and things don't go well at all.  Caesar sends a couple of apes to the nearest town to scout out the situation.  Between the humans that want to kill the apes and the apes that want to kill the humans all out war erupts between the two.

5226755,3,B0090SI4BA,"Unnecessary antagonists.
Unnecessary plot lines.
Infinite ammo guns!

So the flaws.
The surviving humans need power to survive in the remains of San Fran and they send a group out to find and repair a hydro electric plant and they bump into the apes.  The 1st problem; the bald plot antagonist guy freaks out and shoots and wounds an ape causing a huge problem ... but the apes let them go ... but the humans need to be there to fix the dam .... so they send this gun crazy guy BACK OUT after he clearly demonstrated that he was unstable.  HE DID NOT NEED TO BE IN THE MOVIE ... you had a good story already made ... the need to expand ... you know, how America was founded in the 1st place by Europeans ... I know that was a two fer with char and plot lines ...

Back in San Fran, Gary Oldman tells everyone WE HAVE GUNS ... which were guarded by two rednecks and noone else.  Seriously they let these two ppl test the weapons under the bridge by themselves and eventually the apes come and take these guns ... that were in absolutely  0 secured areas ... they were just sitting there under the bridge out in the open (Which weather would of destroyed them & the ammo)

Soooo, the apes get the guns and low-and-behold the guns never run out of ammo... .ever .... all the apes do is run around firing cause EVOLUTION!!!!.

Humans at this point deserve to lose ... you let infinite ammo guns lay out in the open and you send a small group of people out with crappy guns into the woods to explore, and when the apes do attack ... everyone just stands in the way ... only like 10ppl use their guns to try and fight off the apes....

Things I do like...

The plot with the Apes was pretty damn good... FAR better than any story the humans had going for them.
The apes for the most part (save the stupid action heavy scenes) CGI looks amazing.

Should you own it?  Sure it is a nice addition to the series, just wait for it to be on sale ... full price is a bit much for what this offers.",1418083200,,1983,4.135416666666667

5226784,4,B0090SI4BA,"Made me feel like I was a kid again. I always liked movies that have cities and other structures in some form of neglect from being abandoned by people. I liked the Muir Woods sign and the HWY 101 sign. The gas station was okay too until they got the power back on. It's hard to believe that it was up and running with all the lights, spinning ball sign, and music playing when the power went out. The power station itself looked like it had been abandoned for decades, and would have needed a lot more work to start producing electricity again. The power lines are all intact after years of no service? As for the story, well I guess there could be an ape that develops human intellect from taking some new concoction, but shouldn't it have been tested on rodents first? But then smart rats wouldn't be able to hold a machine gun, at least not in their own. Maybe a team of rats could have operated each weapon, but that would be more comical than scary. It's a good movie for a day off if you have nothing else to do, and don't put too much thought into it.",1417910400,6,1059,4.221674876847291

I was yelling at the screen much of the time. I actually liked the 2011 one reasonably well, this one was so ridiculous... every choice made by human and ape characters is so simplistic and utterly dumb. The plot is just horrible. My 2 young nephews (elementary school) write better action plot movies than this. That being said:
 The expressions on the ape faces are friggin' AWESOME! I loved that... And the action scenes were cool -- but the reasoning BEHIND the action sequences was so bad that you couldn't really enjoy the action because you just wanted to scream at what was happening... The climax (so to speak) scene... everything... you've seen it so many times. I don't understand how this movie got good reviews other than the amazing. This was a horrible movie. On second thought, I really can't give it 2 stars after all.

5226823,5,B0090SI4BA,"Originally, this had been slated to be a trilogy.  This third installment in the rebooted Apes franchise exhibits a remarkable story that stays relatively true to the original 70's cult classics while infusing a fresh Ape-centered storyline into the fore.  Over the course of the three films, the story's focus has shifted away from humanity to the apes.

Unsurprisingly, with today's advancing CG technology... the film comes off marvelously - beautifully.  There are scenes where it looks a bit campy... but these are done more to present story and are not lacking in cinematic beauty, just superfluous in story-building.

In a nutshell, the story picks up a decade after the events in the last film.  Caesar and his liberated primates have retreated to Muir woods while the whole of humanity descends into a post-apocalyptic contagion nightmare.  As any biological species would be faced with... the central challenge between the two groups is a simple one -- how do we survive?

The tension and emotional depth of and between the characters is palpable.  The director and writers do an excellent job of presenting a moral and ethical dilemma faced not by the humans, but by the apes.  I can imagine the story separating the audience into different factions as it does in the film.  Will you side with Caesar?  Or Koba?  And when you choose your camp, where will it take you?

This film presents an interesting question in its conclusion... Where will the story go from here?",1417910400,2,1478,4.931174089068826
5226824,3,B0090SI4BA,"I don't know exactly what I was expecting- two hours of intense fighting and a few profound messages, apparently- but I was disappointed.  Maybe the media hype was to blame.  The things that are indisputable are that 1) the CGI is so convincing that you, in your state of suspended disbelief, of course, never doubt the reality of what is before your eyes 2) the fighting and war scenes, when they do happen, are rightly spectacular, and 3) the acting of the male cast is excellent (Keri Russell's character was so quiet and so barely involved that a wet dishcloth could have carried the role).  One of the things that bothered me while watching was the pushing of the theme of family to the boundaries of ok, we get it, Ceasar's relationship with his son is running parallel to the human lead's relationship with his son.  In fact, it was the emotional cliches between honest action that bogged down the movie for me. The meant-to-be-heartstring-tugging moments were right out of the Hollywood trope trunk.

5226994,5,B0090SI4BA,"This was my favorite movie of 2014.  The cinematography is great.  There is very little spoken dialogue, but Andy Serkis and the other motion capture actors added incredible emotion to the apes.
So much so that all characters feelings were very well conveyed.
The new Planet of the Apes is the only reboot I can think of better than the original movies.
The human characters were by far the weakest part of the film.  But this isn't Planet of the Humans.
The film squarely focuses on Ceasar, his family, and his immense wisdom to see the whole picture insteas of only the here and now.  Our current imperial president could learn a thing or two from Ceasar.  Ceasar is the smartest of all the Apes.  Ceasar does not want to be a king.  The ape who got the 2nd highest amount of exposure to the chemical is Koba.  Koba lived as a test subject in a lab.  Ceasar was raised by humans and has seen their good side.  This gives Ceasar a positive, peaceful, and hopeful worldview and Koba has the opposite.  Koba ended Rise of the planet of the Apes by pushing the CEOs helicopter off The Golden Gate Bridge.  This was seen as his revenge for the years of torture he received in the lab.  Koba thinks all humans are bad.  You could call him a racist to an extent.
Ceasar believes Apes and people can be good or bad.  Koba believes people are inherinetly bad.  Ceasar sees the good in people.  Its really a much more profound movie than it seems on the outside.

5227004,4,B0090SI4BA,"The original APES franchise is something that never really interested me. I enjoyed the premise of the film, but just felt that it was too overblown and it didn't help that Charlton Heston gives one of his hammiest performances, so I didn't really have much interest in seeing any of the sequels. However, reading the incredibly strong reviews for RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES piqued my interest, and it's always fantastic to see Andy Serkis doing his motion capture performances, and I loved that film. It had strong performances, a strong heart and a strong message. When I heard that Matt Reeves had been selected to direct this sequel to the prequel, I was on board almost immediately, and seeing such a strong cast with Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman and Serkis returning as Caesar, seeing DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES was a no-brainer. And while I didn't love it as much as the previous installment, there's still a lot to admire and appreciate.

The film opens with the revelation that it has been 10 years since the previous film, and due to the experimental drug that Caesar and the apes were exposed to that gave them human intelligence but revealed was deadly to humans, most of the world's human population has died off in what was called ""The Simian Flu"", and the few that remain in this post-pandemic society are genetically immune. In that time, Caesar and his fellow test subjects have built a home for themselves in the Muir Woods outside San Francisco. They live off the land and don't interfere with the remaining humans as long as they are not interfered with themselves. The human remnants in San Francisco, led by the strength of Dreyfus (Oldman) and the brains of Malcolm (Clarke), are running out of time, though. They need electricity, and the only source capable is the dam near Muir Woods. When they venture out into it, all of the apes are distrusting initially, but once Malcolm, his doctor girlfriend Ellie (Russell) and his artist son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are able to establish trust, Caesar welcomes them to complete their work and leave them in peace. However, Caesar's friend/rival Koba hates humans because of the terrible experimentation done on him when he was in their labs and sets into motion events that will force apes and humans clash in a struggle that could prove to be cataclysmic for both.

There are a few things that really set DAWN apart from RISE. First is the world building. Reeves, the director of CLOVERFIELD and the English language remake of the brilliant Swedish vampire film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (simply called LET ME IN), and writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver have really created a lived-in world for the apes and the humans to inhabit and explore, which is fantastic. Second is the CG and motion-capture work, which is eye-poppingly amazing. There's never a moment's doubt that what you're seeing is real. Third is that, despite the presence of powerful performers like Oldman, Clarke and Russell, this is very much a film about the apes and not the humans, and that's not a complaint. However, it doesn't leave give any of the human characters much to do. This is also the first film I've ever seen where the lead performer is the mo-cap performer ahead of the actual on-screen actors, which is also not a complaint, since Serkis does some incredible and wonderful work here as Caesar, not just as a mo-cap performer but as an actor. He brings gravitas and understanding to Caesar; something that is largely absent in most mo-cap performances.

The moral of the tale isn't lost on me either (although it was when I was watching the film), which seems to be that giving an animal human intelligence will also give way to animals behaving with both the best and the worst that humanity has to offer. I was uncomfortable initially with the film's story primarily being about how the apes can be just as bad as we can, particularly since the first film was much more about how the noble nature of the animals exceeding humanity's understanding of them. But after thinking about it, it made a lot more sense. In effect, Caesar and Koba are the MLK/Malcolm X or Professor X/Magneto of the APES universe, and by pitting one against the other, the film takes on a more significant meaning.

Aside from some plot contrivances and some cliched characters, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a very strong, well-made and well-executed film that will leave most audiences clamoring for the next installment.",1417737600,3,4494,4.7650834403080875

5227140,5,B0090SI4BA,"I really like where this franchise is going, story and performances from Ape actors are amazing! I like that the film focuses on the apes more than the humans, as it is supposed to (not like latest Godzilla for example, where the infamous monster only appears for 20 minutes in a 2 hour movie named after him). And the apes are complex, very political, very family oriented, very proud. Jason Clarke does a good job as the generic human good guy (Honestly it could've been any actor. I think they should have casted Mark Wahlberg to make up for the bad Planet of the Apes reboot from 2001. Not his fault, it was Tim Burton's weird take on the franchise).
  The other thing I thought of when I saw this film was 12 Monkeys. One reviewer made a reference to Contagion, but I thought of the 12 Monkeys movie where the monkey symbols were spray painted on the walls of the city when the deadly virus killed everyone in that film (in the scene when the apes entered the city, the walls were spray painted with the words ""Simien Flu"" and a monkey/ape painted next to it).
  Overall, an excellent film, better than 'Rise' in my opinion (which never happens, sequels are usually not better than the first film). I really like the character development, especially Ceasar (played by Andy Serkis, who deserves an Oscar nomination) as the Ape leader/savior.

The lower ratings of this movie involve Amazon issues and most low ratings involving the movie point to ignorant movie watchers based on the zero of 20+ sharing how unhelpful the reviews were. Too bad people cannot recognize decent storytelling...herd of millenniums and ignorant viewers make up the bottom feeding, negative reviews. If you spend enough time in the 1 and 2 star reviews you can tell how shallow the gene pool has become.

The movie delivers and furthers the story at a pace that is set to tie in with the classic's of the early 60's and 70's. With the advancement of filmmaking it does a far better job connecting you to the apes dropping you right into the story approx. 10yrs after the first film.

It is a long movie. There is a plot (Even if you can't seem to point it out.)

If you can't handle long movies and can't find/enjoy rhetorical meaning, then don't watch it (Like Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, etc).

They came across as very cartoon like in their behaviour and conversations with each other, it would have been more realistic if they had just used the sign language and kept is as a basic understanding of what each animal wanted for the other.

Plot was weak though (spoilers). There's the power struggle, the leadership challenge, the betrayal, the left for dead but he's not really, the hanging by your fingers about to plunge to your death and other character has to make a moral decision.  The original modern version spin on the old Planet of the Apes film franchise was good, because it was different and entertaining, and made you care about both the human and ape characters.

He basically threw two paranoid characters in a room together and the ape one rage caged the hell out of this film.

5227443,4,B0090SI4BA,"Excellent, epic film that manages to actually do a great job of using technology to actually push film art forward, instead of sideways or backwards.  You could throw everything else out, and it is still worth seeing for the (mostly) amazing ability the advanced CGI and blending/production work.  The cinematography and writing are all very good as well, extremely well-produced and written on the whole for a big theater film.

There are some overly drawn out scenes that would've better without the ""feel good"" sappiness milked for too long, and the pace is too fast on the other end of things, possibly as a result of forced editing.  But the incredible tension throughout the story the film does a great job of conveying, the completely awesome action sequences, and the unpredictable nature of the events at times, make it completely worthwhile.

It really takes you back to the classic epic sci-fi and action movies of the 70's and 80's, where you felt yourself pulled emotionally towards the main characters, rooting for one group or another, and sitting-up during the tense sequences. You care about Caesar, his family/friends, and the depictions of the apes in their environments and communicating with each other etc..., are completely amazing to watch, as it's something you'd never experienced before in film history, in this way or to this degree.

Final note: The ""CGI"" used, is still not perfect of course, it's just really, really well done, and despite the bad name CGI is getting over the years, Dawn proves there's an amazing future for virtual reality in film when it is done right, and also incredibly powerful.",1417132800,3,1633,4.985294117647059

Here the true protagonists are apes, not humans (as it was the case in the previous movie).
Cesar ""leader'', is more charismatic than all the human characters who appear in the movie.
Oscar for Andy Serkins right now!
And that is a weak point, the characters ""humans'' are completely simple (guilty script) something that was not the case in"" the rise'', the characters were very well defined, the script was higher than it is.
This movie remains a step below the previous film, but still it's a very good movie.
It's not only the conflict between humans and apes, apes against apes, and humans against humans.

5227445,5,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes place ten years after humans have been nearly wiped out. The apes have built a thriving community in the deep forest. The chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) has a family: wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), teen son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston), and a baby on the way. Former adversary Koba (Toby Kebbell) has become an ally, while aging orangutan Maurice (Karin Konnoval) mentors the young and serves as adviser to the adults.

In this post-pandemic world, there are pockets of surviving humans. A small group, consisting of architect Malcolm (Jason Clarke), former Centers for Disease Control nurse Ellie (Keri Russell), and Malcolms teenage son, Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), hope to reactivate a deserted power plant on the apes turf to provide electricity. Caesar gives permission, provided all guns are surrendered.

The actors portraying the apes far outshine those portraying humans. Computer-generated images are seamlessly blended with superior make-up that enables the actors to convey emotion. The apes communicate in a form of simple sign language, translated in subtitles.

Mr. Serkis (Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films) has probably the most expressive eyes in movies today. His presence is so commanding that we are glued to him whenever hes on screen. His close-ups convey exactly what Casesar is thinking, particularly when confronted with unanticipated problems. We believe Caesar as a leader because of Mr. Serkis compelling work.

Also amazing is Mr. Kebbells Koba, a creature who was tortured by humans in laboratory experiments, bears their scars, and is understandably distrustful of humans. Mr. Kebbell gives Koba an intimidating personality that makes many of his fellow simians cower in fear.

5227509,5,B0090SI4BA,"Amazing, how the reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise is producing such terrific films - this one being no exception.  A fan of the original series, I was wholly impressed with its predecessor, but Dawn easily lives up to it, with the level of special effects achievable in film today worthy of these stories ... yet not overshadowing them, instead giving you a backdrop of mostly-ape characters that you grow to love and care about even more than their human counterparts.  Here, ten years after a pandemic (the ""simian flu"") has killed off most of the world, in San Francisco a remaining faction of humans must access a dam in order to keep their power going - and find it rests in the middle of the forest land apes have called home since Caesar led the revolution years ago.  Will peace, or war, will win in the end?  With both sides having both friends and enemies within their own camp, it comes down to Caesar and the human's leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) to try and keep things civil even as war is plotted from within.  Brilliant film.",1416873600,2,1050,4.534391534391534

5227535,5,B0090SI4BA,"""The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a retrospective about the human race, chimps, and interspecies participation.

Caesar the Ape, mimed so skillfully by Andy Serkis, is a grown up ape with a lot of responsibilities, the first being his gargantuan responsibility towards Apedom as a whole--he is a leader now, and his past vanished with the Simian Flu, an Ape borne illness that also wiped out most of mankind.  Of course, the blame is shared, because as Keri Russell says to that guy from Oz: ""The virus was created by scientists working in a lab.  You can't blame the apes.""  He does, of course, and I was personally jubilant when Koba took him out.

This does not have the comparatively light touch of ""Rise"".  Caesar is a husband and father of a baby ape and a grown up ape, Blue Eyes.  There are parallels on every side of the struggle, but the humans are not the first to *break out* the firepower.  An apocalyptic world, one sees the chimps behave in much the same way as humanity--till Caesar, the Ape equivalent of a Che Guevara or ferocious Gandhi, becomes leader again.  Recommended heavily.",1416700800,,1106,4.6020408163265305

I liked the direction of the story overall, but some of the technical details irritated me. I know that we don't watch movies to see the characters reload their weapons, but for the sake of realism, movie makers can't just give their characters automatic weapons that continually fire at will. Also, oversimplification of restoring power to the city from a hydro dam bothered me. I work in that industry and know that you just can't turn on a generator and leave it to run.

5227606,4,B0090SI4BA,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014) takes place ten years after the previous film, 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" The virus unleashed at the end of that film has wiped out most of the human race, but a large group of survivors live in a walled section of San Francisco while the chimp Caesar and his band of apes live in the forests north of the city. The humans need to take control of the dam near the ape's village to secure power for their city, which leads to both friendly and hostile relations. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell lead the human cast.

This film's on par with the previous one, so if you liked that one you'll like this one too. The CGI is both good and yet cartoony. Strangely, the CGI in ""Jurassic Park"" was better, and that was 21 years ago! But, hey, they're better that the FX on Syfy and you get used to 'em after the first act.

The forest cinematography is awesome, but the story is only mildly compelling. The characters are okay, but bland and the plot fairly predictable. For instance, when Keri' Russell's character goes to the ape village you know exactly what she's going to do; and when Caesar spares a fellow ape you know exactly what that ape's going to do. Overall, I was expecting better, but it's a decent addition to the apes saga and ranks about the 4th or 5th best in the entire series.

The film runs 130 minutes and was shot at Golden Ears Provincial Park, Campbell River & Vancouver, British Columbia with beauty shots of San Francisco.

However, I feel nothing new has been presented with this movie.  The build up to the final confrontation happen as expected.  I did not feel there was any real deep exploration explaining difference between human & ape.  There wasn't a greater explanation or further thoughts on the story.  The conclusion was uneventful & not really interesting.  The ending of the movie seemed to state there would be a third installment but I don't feel another installment would advance the story.

5227940,3,B0090SI4BA,"Perhaps this gritty realism trend has gone too far in movies.  In the original POTA, thousands of years had passed so it made sense that the apes had evolved to be more humanoid.  Their advanced state also helped the theme/juxtaposition of devolved humans vs advanced apes and the underlying political themes/commentary.  In the 2014 version, apes have taken a genetic short cut to intelligence, so you literally have monkeys talking/signing.  Looks a bit odd.  Story is well executed, but generic.",1415923200,,498,5.175

5227947,4,B0090SI4BA,"How do you rate this movie? A 2? A 3? Perhaps a 4? A 5? I like how one person summarized it, ""Just watch it. You will like it.""  Likely true.  I think the younger you are, the more likely you will rate this movie more highly because of the overused plot twists and characters will not seem so obvious.

I think it isn't hard to see that this is a blockbuster movie and will be liked by many.  So, I am not going to rehearse the many great things as others have already said.  I ended up with 4 stars, so I must have liked it (and I did). But what will drive you nuts about this movie?  What will be the part that will make you wonder if this is really a great movie or not??  See below.  :)

It isn't a minute into the film when the human villian [played by the normally excellent Kirk Acevedo)shoots one of the apes in cold blood.  Then the major plot line is etched, ""Will the humans and the apes be friends, or will there be a fight?""  Is that one element enough to keep you watching?  Yeah, It works... just not well.  Not too long after Kobo (the bad ape) is shown as the villian for the apes.  And now the two bad ones will take turns destroying the fragile peace.  ugh.  It gets old.

After Kirk Acevedo shoots the boy ape, our hero ""Malcomb"" decides he is going to take him up to Ape country to help fix the generator.  WHAT!?  You want to scream, if you hadn't already guessed this moron would be the reason everything goes south.  You know it before the next hour and a half shows us... and thus, the movie just doesn't hold our attention as much as it could have.  And with the bad ape wondering around, we know there will be friction on both sides.  And if you know the basic story line, you KNOW that this is (after all) the PLANET OF THE APES, so that at some point, humans are going to go down.  Will it be in this movie? In the next?  How will it come about?  That we do not know and I will not ruin what little tension exists with such a disclosure.

Love that the apes can talk.  Love the basic set-up for the show.  A flu-strain... think ebola on steroids... called the simian flu has wiped out 499 out of every 500 humans on the planet.  We follow some humans near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco...of course, the same area of Ceasar and the Apes that we see in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  This only makes sense.

But then comes serious plot twist two: The humans are now without power (it's been 10 winters since ""Rise"")  and must fix the Hydroelectric plant to get more.

Wait! You may think.  ""Power?  Isn't this the very BANE of HUMAN existence???!!!  Of course.  And so, the next plot twist is not without a certain dread that the humans will NOT be successful... as the APES have the moral high ground of needing no electricity and no power (except for the guns which they strangely like).  See, if you love the idea of humans living without power and not damaging the earth's ecosystem with power hungry devices, then you will likely LIKE this plot development... you know that it is doomed for failure.  If you, on the other hand, prefer human survival, you will likely see this as a needless plot line....because you too know it is doomed for failure.

So, while we give the movie kudos for a believable way to kill off so many people (despite the fact that in the original it is a nuclear war to blame), we simply think that the film could have been developed so much better than, ""Will the humans and apes fight and what will happen because of it.""  4minutes into the show we know the whole thing.

Our lead actor is acceptable, but very forgettable. Don't even recall his name any more.  I would not knowingly go to see a movie because he was in it.  That seems a strange choice for such a high budget film. At least, if you are going with an unknown actor for a lead in a block buster, give us someone memorable and highly likable.

Excellent special effects (aside from the bad special effects of the chimps on horses where they grow two feet to be able to straddle the horses)>  Odd.

I do believe this movie will be among the more forgettable ones, aside from action sequences.  Still 4 stars for a great ending and for extending the great franchise... and giving us so many places to go with the next Planet of the Apes movie.  I think the next one could be the best new Ape movie.

Violence?  Yes. Of course, it is a war scene at end.  Plenty of blood, so be aware.  Cussing?  Yes, including F-word.  No drugs or overt sexual escapades that I recall.  Hatred?  Plenty, on both sides.

Basic theme of movie is good.  There are good people, there are bad people.  There are good apes, there are bad apes.  ""We are a lot alike.""
Next movie likely will be Human army arriving to snuff out what remains of the Ape community in San Francisco area.  Apes will of course protect themselves.  Don't expect that Ceasar will be in charge when all is over, but who knows.  If the Apes must take over (to be the Planet of the Apes), then they will have to win some wars over humans.  Or, perhaps they will simply return to the franchise take... the men come in.... try to win... are not, so they drop nukes.... destroying themselves more than they destroy the Apes... then, years later, it is the Apes in control of the Planet. See, I think next movie or two will be very intersesting.  How do we get from peace loving Ceasar to the Planet of the Apes.  Looking forward to it.

5227950,4,B0090SI4BA,"Not a stunning sequel, but it does do quite a lot well.  It feels like the old Planet of the Apes movies.  It's weird and and wonderful, a pleasure to gawk at.  Even the score is a throw-back to those classic films.  The inclusion of massive amounts of CGI does not hurt this movie one bit.  The acting is perfect.  The apes are all too human at times, terrifying at others, and unsettling the rest of the time.

This is a great post apocalyptic sci-fi movie, plain and simple.  Keeps you watching, keeps you guessing, and adds quite a lot of character conflict into the mix.  You really never know what is going to happen.

The only flaws are in characterization and the ending.  We know little about everybody, except Caesar.  Nothing interesting about anybody.  Just throw-away characters, really.  Except Caesar and some of his crew.  They have some character--pun intended.  But mostly because we know them from the first movie.  There is a lame father-son dynamic pushed down our throats on each side of this conflict, but it eases off just as it gets vomit-worthy.

The ending is pretty dumb.  It's just an obvious set up for another movie.  It feels like there are a few scenes missing when the credits roll.  Oh well.  Monkey see as monkey do.

5227951,5,B0090SI4BA,"This movie is definitely a ride from beginning to end!

The character development of Caesar and Koba is magnificent.  Some parts are a tad bit hokey, but for the most part, the story truly draws you in to the mindset of the apes, how they got to the point they either loved or hated humans and how that transcends into the previous POTA movies.

Koba makes this movie more interesting than ANY of the characters in my opinion.  You have to see this ape go from already hater to reason to hate even more.

Caesar's role in the movie makes him almost too human in my opinion, but nonetheless, Andy kills again!  Seeing his family go through tribulation and come out of it, to some degree (thanks to Koba's mistake(s)) makes it all worthwhile in the end.

I can't wait until the third installment.  I'm curious to see how they develop Maurice and Caesar's son.",1415750400,3,857,4.483870967741935

I don't understand is why Director's decide to end movies that have the potential for being special with the main characters fighting for there lives in computer generated construction sites.  It nearly became like we were watching an animated movie which we were.

5227956,5,B0090SI4BA,"After watching the first movie and enjoying it so much, I couldn't wait for the sequel. Normally sequels do not hold up to the original, but in the case of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, they really came through for the audience. I love the interaction and mistrust elements between the two separate species. They really moved the story along in a way that makes perfect sense for both. You get an overall feeling there is no good guys and bad guys. Great cast, entertaining effects that don't overshadow the story line, and an ending that will make you wish that the 3rd installment in the franchise was already out. I'm not sure how many they plan on making because the older movies from the 70's went on too long, but if they make a remarkable ending for the next movie, it would be a perfect trilogy. You can't make Planet of the Apes any better than this without losing what it's all about... Separation leads to conflict, working as one collective unit makes you stronger with a much better chance for ALL to survive.

Just a movie thing to make them look scarier I guess but doesn't make any sense. The battering ram, again, where did they learn that? Book reading or time travel to medieval ages? One of the biggest parts of this movie that doesn't make any sense is why none of the humans take the apes seriously. When the ape virus goes worldwide and kills millions and being on worldwide news, NOBODY in the future remembers this?!?! C'mon!! It also doesn't help that you'd think, well.. at least you'd Think that an ape talking after becoming increasingly intelligent (oh yea.. also TALKS) while helping cure alheimers disease would be beyond HUGE news, right? Nope! Apparently everyone in the future has forgotten their history. Either way that alzheimers was cured w/ an increasingly intelligent monkey that didn't make the news or, people in the future have forgotten their history, either way, doesn't any sense. Towards the ending they needed a forced climatic moment so what do they do? Instead of doing a simple explanation (no spoilers) of what Really happened the entire situation could've been avoided, but what happens? He doesn't say anything and leads to this unnecessary Hollywood Michael Bay explosion and then this dumb fight that could've been avoided. With everything that's wrong w/ this movie, it even manages to drag down the previous movies as well as they won't make as much sense as much, this is how bad this movie is.

So w/ everything wrong w/ this movie why 2 stars? The cgi is incredible, the apes, the city, everything looks amazing. Voice over work was really well done as well. That's all about all the positives of this movie.

Overall:
I would recommend this film to people if they need something to watch as it is a fun watch, but if you're looking for a good movie, don't waste your time.",1413763200,3,2298,4.655172413793103
5227962,2,B0090SI4BA,"Good special features alone do not a good movie make. I loved Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It did what Tim Burton could not (despite the help from studly Mark Wahlberg) - reinvigorate a decades-dormant franchise. Femmes of a certain age will recall with delight the sights of Charlton Heston and James Franciscus in the movies that started it all: the original Planet of the Apes and the far more disturbing Beneath the Planet of the Apes (oh, what has become of our human race, yikes!). Franciscus was a God among men (I say that as a Christian-minded gal, too) and it's so tragic he passed prematurely. But along comes the person who just might be his natural successor, Mr. James Franco - he of the arm-severing 127 Hours (brilliance!). Rise was, in a word, a marvelous entertainment.

Gary Oldman is a great actor but he can't be blamed for failing to ""nail"" his character here in Dawn - well, no one wrote one for him to play, in the first place! This is predictable, by the numbers storytelling from start to finish and does almost NOTHING to advance the new Apes timeline begun in Rise. Well, of course it establishes the new intelligence and self-awareness of the Caesar-led apes. But that was conveyed in the 2 minute trailer! We simply didn't need a full movie to make it apparent.",1413676800,3,1294,4.577586206896552
5227973,4,B0090SI4BA,"[Warning - Plot Spoilers]

As others have remarked, the movie opens with simulated news clips of a pandemic spreading across the globe. One clip briefly shows Obama, with a voice pretending to be his offerings words of reassurance. To those readers who never voted for him, that would elicit cynical sighs. But some of you may also remember when Reagan was president, and another sci-fi movie [I forget which] about aliens visiting Earth showed him 'saying' we should welcome them. Crikey, 26 years ago!

Aside from that, as I write this, the US now has detected another local Ebola victim. So the movie is quite unintentionally topical, though years later when perhaps you might be reading this, it will be thusly dated.

There are many awkward points about the movie, some of which other reviewers may already have pointed out. But one thing is stark, to anyone who has operated a ham radio. The movie shows the humans in San Francisco needing to hook up to electricity from a dam nearby. When they do this, the lights on the skyscrapers turn on. But beforehand, we are told that they only have a few weeks of diesel fuel left and things are getting critical. Well, after the hookup, they now use a radio transmitter to contact other survivors elsewhere. Here's the skinny. You don't need a lot of electricity to do this. Then by bouncing your signal across the ionosphere, you can reach across the globe. A portable diesel generator, or indeed any source of minimal electricity will suffice. Marconi and others effectively did this over a century ago.

Ham operators already do this, all the time. Point is, the SF chaps would already have contacted others at the start of the movie.

Another tricky point will be clear to any or many of you familiar with firearms. The apes are using guns designed for human hands. Unless Larmarck was right, they could not have evolved so quickly [10 years!] to facilely have comparable fingers. And none of them are shown practising with the guns they captured. Cmon! Humans using guns for the first time would be terrible shots.

Yet another is the bowlderising that was going on. We never see the genitalia of the apes. Unlike the apes in the 60s and 70s movies, all these apes are naked. Yes, males have smaller genitals relative to their size than humans. But even so, notice if you watch the movie how all that is brushed over, literally. Look carefully and you see nothing. Reminds me of that movie a few years ago which had real pigs in it. Some were depicted as males. But all the actual pigs were female, because the director did not want the male genitalia visible in the shots.

Having said all this, the movie is still enjoyable. To some extent, the plot and screenwriters did the best they could to smooth over the implausibilities. And let's wait for the next episode !!",1413331200,,2823,4.679435483870968
5227974,5,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the follow-up to 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes and truly Dawn of the Planet of the Apesputs the mesmerizingly talented Andy Serkis in the spotlight that he truly deserves. Serkis reprises his motion-capture role as Caesar, leader of the now highly evolved population of apes. Ten years have passed since the battle of San Francisco. The H5N1 virus, nicknamed the Simian Flu, has killed off most of humanity except for a miniscule group of people immune to the virus. The apes have migrated to the forests and have evolved to such a degree that they have built a civilization that has allowed them to develop an entire culture. Oddly the fantastic score by Michael Giacchino during an early scene where the apes demonstrate a highly advanced hunting technique is reminiscent of the score from 2001 A Space Odyssey that accompanies that films apes making an important evolutionary step.

It is this kind of subtext that makes the film so impressive. As the surviving humans realize they are running out of fuel, they conclude that their only hope is repairing a power-generating dam that is smack in the middle of the apes new civilization. Fear and paranoia mount on both sides as a stage is set worthy of Shakespeare, Serkiss character being named Caesar clearly being intentional. Caesars memory of compassionate humans causes him to hesitantly permit a group of humans lead by Ellie (Keri Russel) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) to repair the dam. Ellie and Malcolm are two Chimp-athetic humans, if I may use a phrase coined by Entertainment Weeklys film critic Chris Nashawaty, but many of the other humans are not including the desperate human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who will not allow his people to sink back to the uncivilized life they had before setting up their current compound in San Francisco.

Of course, misplaced trust and a few bad apples on both sides threaten the safety and livelihood of both man and ape resulting in the threat of another all-out war. Caesar and Malcolm are tasked with the mission of trying to maintain peace.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an incredibly good looking movie and one with momentary glances of brilliance. Most of the films success can be attributed to the expressive Andy Serkis, however. Never in all of his underrated performances has he given a performance so emotional, raw, and empathetic. Caesar is an ape of few words, regardless of his ability to speak, and his face (and consequently Serkiss) communicates complex emotions unlike anything we have seen him convey before. If Tilda Swintons performance in Snowpiercer starts the Summer Oscar conversation, Serkiss totally immersive performance as Caesar certainly adds to it.

If you're looking for something to wash that bad taste Transformers: Age of Extinction left in your mouth, then a Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is just the thing. A-",1412726400,104,2899,4.8861788617886175

5227981,5,B0090SI4BA,"I love the original Planet of the Apes, as most people do, hated the Tim Burton remake and thought that Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a decent soft reboot of this series. Well, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an absolutely sublime near masterpiece. I wasn't expecting much from this and was completely blown away. THIS movie is in the great tradition of classical science-fiction where a concept or idea is used to explore the human condition while also intelligent and thoughtful in ways that would have made Rod Serling proud.

I mention Serling because The Twilight Zone is my most beloved TV show of all time and his approach is exactly how Sci-fi should be while Rod also had a hand in scripting the original 1968 film. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is such a rich and rewarding movie. The Direction, scripting, acting, FX etc... everything is AAA+ and restors my faith that high quality Sci-fi movies CAN be made in Hollywood. It's frankly amazing that 20th Century Fox was able to put out not only Dawn but X-Men Days of Future Past as well!?! This is the studio that was ridiculed for being unable to make anything other than brainless garbage. Fox used to make soo many fantastic movies but Tom Rothman ran the studio into the ground for almost 20 years. I don't think it's a coincidence that he left Fox in 2012 and we now get two excellent genre films from the studio that used to make soo many great ones before that tool took over.

Anywho, 10 years after a viral outbreak, a simian civilization is flourishing having had no contact with the remnants of humanity after most of it has died out. An encounter with a band of humans, who seek to restart a hydro electric damn in Ape territory, sparks new conflict.

This movie is perfect on almost every level. Director Matt Reeves' Direction is classical in style while he avoids using any horrible shakey cam for the action sequences. The cinematography is sumptuous with stong earthly colors and nary a lens filter to be seen. The editing is tight but also knows when to let the performances breath. The Visual Effects are perfect. Each Ape has character and the performance capture gets great results. The acting is wonderful and a score that supports the visuals tops it of to perfection.

I just want to make special mention of the script. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER has very clear motivations and you can understand were they are coming from. There are no real villains here, just people with different agendas that have been informed by their experiences. That's great writing. I really can't wait to see what the next chapter is in this series but my hope is that they can craft a better film which will be a tall order as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best sequels ever made and virtually perfect in ever way.",1410998400,7,2797,4.532673267326732

5227995,4,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
 Unlike the recent hyper-successful crash and bang Transformers 4 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a character driven movie.  Does that sound strange to say about a film with a $170 million budget that involves talking simians?  Ye, but it nevertheless rings true.  We love thePlanet of the Apes franchise because of the whole human/ape role reversal thing which we think is soooo cool.  We got that right, it is cool.  This one is billed as a Sci-Fi/Action flick.  It should be labeled as a grand tragedy, filmed on a wide canvas like War and Peace but with chimps instead of the French as antagonists.  Or something.
 The main human characters are Dreyfus, the leader of the human survivors living precariously in San Francisco, played with unusual enthusiasm by the usually lower octane Gary Oldman.  Keri Russell plays Ellie, the girl, an undeveloped character who is little more than window dressing.  The roles available for women in big action flicks are nearly always undeveloped, to our lasting shame.  Jason Clarke plays Malcolm, her fellah and acts as the main conduit for the Ape-Human interchange that does not involve mutual murder.  Still only in her mid thirties, we remember Russell from her TV show Felicity, the current The Americans and other TV and film work. Australian born Jason Clarke has diverse skills as shown by his roles in the TV cult hit Farscape, White House Down, The Rabbit-Proof Fence and Wall Street: The Money Never Sleeps.  He is put on screen with Chimpanzees, which must be a tough assignment.
 Andy Serkis plays the Ape leader Caesar.  His henchman (hench-ape?) Koba is played by Toby Kebbel.  We cant tell who the actors are because they look and act like Apes.  Well, Apes who can talk.
 The take away from The Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the epic battle on the Golden Gate Bridge between the smart simians and people.  The take away here has to be the aching sense of impending doom.  The best of the humans-Malcolm- and the best of the Apes-Caesar-do everything they can do to find a modus operandi.  But we know how volatile monkeys can be.  We know how suspicious humans can be.  The good people in each community see the slowly evolving catastrophe, as does the audience.  The whole little world of Apes and Humans slides slowly to the edge of destruction.  They struggle like insects on fly paper against what seems the inevitable final clash which will ruin both communities and perhaps exterminate one or the other.  Healing a sick Chimp, even the boss Chimps wife, a noble act in and of itself, cannot stop the slide.
 We want to shout Stop the madness at the screen.
 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes comes out on the top of the fairly high pile of films in this series going all the way back to Charlton Heston.  The writers and the director must take the bows for this success.  A trio of writers had their fingers and their ideas on the script.  Action pro Mark Bomback has a string of middling hits behind him.  He wrote Live Free or Die Hard in 2007, The Wolverine last year, the barely watchable Total Recall of 2012 and the underrated Unstoppable of 2010 with Chris Pine and Denzel Washington.  Bomback can do action.  He has written Fifty Shades of Grey which goes into release next year and has signed to write the next Apes movie.
 The other two writers are old collaborators.  Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa also co-wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011.  They mutually penned The Relic and Eye for an Eye.  Neither film made the Oscar nominations but both attracted people who like to go to the flickers and be startled out of their seats.  This seems an odd group to produce a film that for all the chest thumping and firefights remains a touching tragedy of interspecies misunderstanding, mistrust and misdeeds.  It seems odd but it works, it works very well.
 Director Matt Reeves has as his most notable directorial success the megahit, Cloverfield.  That movie made buckets of cash by scaring the bejeebers out of the audience.  I mean new Cadillacs for the pool boy buckets of cash.  Reeves has never had the responsibility of such a big budget film before.  He found a way to make something unique and much better than we had a right to expect.  He will be back to direct the next Planet of the Apes film in 2016.  Reeves directed Keri Russell in the Felicity series back in 1998.
 I give a strong four saw-blades to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.  It is rated a fairly mild PG-13 for violence.  People do not take their clothes off in this one.  It has already made $103 million in the three day Friday through Sunday opening weekend.  It should do very well.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes runs for 2 hours and 10 minutes.
 As a marker of relative popularity, Transformers 4 has raked in three quarters of a billion dollars worldwide.",1409356800,5,4852,4.567285382830627

It never ceases to amaze me how American filmmakers can foist this sort of trash onto the public. The movie attempts to depict itself as an epic story of love and war but all the really interesting opportunities are completely lost because the director favours lots of scenes with guns and shooting, which is what Hollywood is really all about anyway. The apes are unconvincing because their culture is more or less a copy of human culture, so although there has been a miraculous development of speech, they have not evolved past the stone age in other respects.

5228020,5,B0090SI4BA,"The newly rebooted saga, which began with Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)and continues this month with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, has captured the spirit and thrill of the original films. Dawn picks up the story 10 years after Rise,where the apes escaped captivity,rampaged along the Golden Gate Bridge,headed up into the hills. Project Nim could be said to have inspired the new reboot of which Dawn is sequel. Rise showed the beginnings of the ape rebellion in which Andy Serkis did a stunning mo-cap performance,displacing Franco as the star. I loved this superb film, directed by Matt Reeves, contracted to do the 3rd film in the rebooted series.

A rule in acting is don'tplay against animals or children(or mo-cap).We have to acknowledge that this computer-filtered form of acting,reveals it in a new light, putting actors playing humans in the shade. They can't compete: this film anthropomorphizes apes more than its predecessor. We see how close apes are to humans. How Serkis' eyes and muscle- movements come through clearly. His slow movements show authority. He taps roots of emotion,gravitas, pathos,solidarity with the ape community,empathy with the human survivors,sentiment with his family group. Apes ride horses,shoot guns,drink alcohol,love,cry,are nostalgic about their childhood,walk upright,speak. They also show similar vices of militarism,aggression. Both species are now vying for dominance.

As leader,Caesar is forced to confront the mistrust of apes as well as the humans,all of whom threaten to destroy each other. When the apes discover a settlement of humans not far from the forest,they are torn between those led by Caesar,who want to help them and those led by Koba(Toby Kebbell) who want to kill them. When communicating with each other they use sign language (which is subtitled),but speak louder in human language when assertive or angry.""Apes do not want war"", Caesar's first communication uttered to the community of humans from his apesmassed on horseback. A central tenet of ape society is "" Ape does not kill ape"",however that core principle is later overturned as ape turns on ape,as Koba strives to become leader and kill humans,after shooting Caesar.

Humans are living in post-apocalyptic wretchedness,short of food,fuel,electricity. A virus(wrongly blamed on the apes) has wiped out huge swathes of population. Their leader is Dreyfus(Oldman, the go-to actor for playing authority figures).The humans are also somewhat underwhelming in the film. Malcolm(Jason Clarke) with his partner Ellie(Keri Russell) must figure out how to build their trust to gain access to the dam. Malcolm and Caesar share similar gentleness and ambivalence,mirroring each other's family grouping. The film has rugged action sequences, extraordinary CGI, mo-cap in wild environments,simian teeth-baring,swaying and screeching. Terrifying scenes of people scurrying for safety as invaders round them up;apes on horseback traversing the dark woods or flying through the tree-tops,hunting deer,killing a bear;the mass attack with them riding tanks,blowing up defences.

Mo-cap acting serves animated features up to a computer. The speech acts come in bite-sized chunks,"" Apes together strong"", ""Caesar loves humans more than apes"".They almost speak like Apaches in old westerns. This is necessary,we are talking about different species. We could be talking about races. In times of intense blood bath in the Middle East, this excellent sequel seems tailor-made to reflect the present conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The scarred Koba is a scourge of humans, a terrorist leader. Kebell projects malevolence brilliantly. Like Serkis he fuses human and ape. Good sci-fi should hold up a mirror to humanity and reflect our own conflicts, issues and failings back to us through a wildly outrageous premise. Splendidly energising,darker and definitely more cool.",1407801600,3,3897,5.533557046979865
5228021,4,B0090SI4BA,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014 release; 130 min.) picks up 10 years from where we left ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". In the movie's opening montage, we learn that during that time, a virus has wiped out much of human kind. leaving only pockets of people here and there. After that, it doesn't take long for the story line to unfold: the apes, still lead by Caesar, live in the forests somewhere north of the Golden Gate Bridge (or what remains of it), and the humans live in San Fran. During a quest to find the dam which could provide power to the city, the humans accidentally bump into the apes, and from there all hell breaks loose. To tell you more of the plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie delivers all the thrills that ""Rise"" provided, and then raises the bar a couple of notches. The first hour of the movie, set mostly in the forests, reminded me in spirit several times of ""Jurassic Park"" actually. The second hour of the movie, set mostly in the city, is just about near-perfect action. Second, the performance of Andy Serkis as Caesar the ape has been much lauded, and rightfully so. The opening shot of the movie, an extreme close-up of Serkis' eyes filling the huge movie screen and then zooming out to give his whole face, is just brilliant. Most importantly, Serkis is able to relate to us emotionally what Caesar is going through. Kerri ""Felicity"" Russell plays one of the humans lead roles, and she looks like she hasn't aged a day in the last 10 years. But the big star of the movie is of course the CGI department, which does a masterful job in creating this planet of the apes. Some of the battle scenes, involving hundreds of apes, are nothing short of eye-popping. Finally, there is a very nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Michael Giacchino. Somewhere in the movie out of the blue The Band's ""The Weight"" pops up as well, and it marks for a light moment, however brief...

The movie has been out over a month and I just now went to see it a few days ago this past weekend. The matinee screening where I saw this at was amazingly still very packed, even though this is the 5th weekend the movie is playing. It's a true testament to the wide popularity of this franchise, and ""Dawn"" in particular. Not surprisingly, a release date for the next sequel has already been announced (July, 2016). I'm looking forward to catching that in 2 years.  Bottom line: if you enjoyed ""Rise"", you will absolutely LOVE ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1407801600,,2630,4.5210084033613445
5228022,4,B0090SI4BA,"What an exciting and thrilling blockbuster! I was worried about this film. This was the 8th add on to the Planet of the Apes series, second to the reboots. So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise.

This isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects!

The original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate?
For me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time Ive seen what I would call a trailer movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending.

My favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends.

This film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting.

5228033,5,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn is a summer spectacle! It became the best movie of the year so far at its release! The interactions between the apes themselves seem so natural and dynamic, it really adds to the movie overall. Ceaser is an incredible leader and Andy Serkis once again captivates us with his motion-capture acting. Toby Kebell is OUTSTANDING as Koba. One of the best performances of the year. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and the rest of the human cast give us characters that we can easily relate to and they make for great moments in their interactions with the simian race. The movie offers incredible story and dialogue. The action is majestic and delivers what we were expecting and more! Matt Reeves comes from directing a monster movie, Cloverfield, to direct a summer blockbuster and the transition does not affect him heavily as the movie is very well directed and so are the actors and performances. The themes are very well developed and the mood feels organic and built very well and kept constantly throughout the whole film. You will not be disappointed when watching this film.

5228036,5,B0090SI4BA,"Picking up ""six winters"" after RISE, DAWN offers us a post-apocalyptic world where only pockets of humans survive - and, of course, other lifeforms, including talking, hyperintelligent apes with a serious bone to pick with humanity. With DAWN, there's a new director, a new star, and plenty of new ideas. It's a very different movie than RISE, but that's not a bad thing; overall, the movie largely makes up for its lack of the fun, humor, and satirical cleverness that helped make RISE so enjoyable by offering a more intelligent, nuanced and explorative film.

Right off the bat, we understand we're dealing with a darker world. It's not exactly clear what happened to humanity, although we know that ""Simian Flu"" played at least some part in the near-apocalypse. With only pockets of surviving humans, and an expanding, bitter ape population, the tone of the movie is set: this is a darker APES, and the stakes are higher. Whereas RISE dealt with the perils and promises of science in advancing human dominance (and ultimately, perhaps, in stopping it), DAWN takes on heavier, harsher themes of war, territorial aggression, paranoia, oppression, torture, and revolution. Naturally, it's not as fun of a ride as RISE, but for good reason.

This movie handles its more earnest tone quite respectably. To the extent that we treat Caesar and his apes as humans or commentaries on humanity, we find parallels with their struggle in the plight of the American Indian, the slave, the tortured detainee, and, basically, any oppressed, subjugated, or otherwise disrespected group. Intriguingly, we also see the apes becoming exactly what they had escaped from and fought against in the first place. It's an old story, but it's done well here.

The cast brings the material to life (and, indeed, elevates it) quite well. Jason Clarke handles the burden of lead actor with admirable ease. Gary Oldman makes you feel for a man who's got it in his heart to kill each and every damn ape on the planet if it'll save his friends and followers. The apes themselves, led by Andy Serkis, provide some of the best and most cinematic performances. Watching one ape fatally throw another off a foyer for refusing to kill a human is almost too impactful for words. It's scary, badass, and intriguing. It works.

DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues where its predecessor left off in finding something fresh, engaging and worthwhile in a silly ol' b-movie sci-fi franchise. It feels less like a sequel to RISE and more like an expansion of the tone and universe this property is capable of exploring. It's an excellent film.",1407110400,73,2607,4.904761904761905

5228039,4,B0090SI4BA,"Set a full ten years after the events of its predecessor, the latest Apes picture has humanity near extinction while Caesar and his ever-expanding family have established a functional utopia amidst the desolation. Most of the first act is a simple, enveloping visual treat - establishing the world as it now stands and savoring the unique visuals of San Francisco (and the surrounding area) in the aftermath of a near-total human annihilation event. Crumbling cityscapes, creeping plant life, reverberations of a lost civilization... this story lends itself nicely to vivid, poignant splashes of scenery, and the effects team is more than up to that challenge. In fact, moving on from that slow, thoughtful series of reflections is a feat the film struggles with. Though rich and layered in its own ways, the story plays second-fiddle to the mood at large, and often feels telegraphed by the events of the first film (not to mention the original series). It's a deep, thought provoking installment, with some lights-out physical acting from the entire motion-capture cast, but I couldn't shake the sense that it could have stretched itself much further than it did. When it came time for the parallel climactic face-offs amidst the fireworks of an unavoidable human/ape warzone, I kept thinking to myself, ""Is this really all there is?"" Firm, fiery and intelligent, but perhaps a bit too safe, too happy to fall back on a set of standard action movie routines.

To me the first movie seemed like a deeper and richer story that was full of emotion and excitement. This one did have some emotional aspects and did have much more action then the first one but to me it didn't feel as full in story as the other one. On the other hand though the different aspects of the war : human vs. ape, ape vs. ape and human vs. human is what really made the movie. It's also a little disheartening knowing that no matter what species or race you are it only takes one to being about an end.

The storyline, stitched together by a series of unlikely coincidences, is surprisingly tame and predictable. A hero found alive, a villain on a cliff; this is War Movies 101.

5228054,4,B0090SI4BA,"Let me just say that this movie is over 2 hours long and I saw it on a 90-degree day where the air conditioner in the movie theater broke. I was sweating, other people were sweating, the theater was starting to smell like a locker room, yet I still stayed for the entire movie. Why? Because it was awesome.

This movie picks up about 10 years after the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. If you're like me, for the first few minutes you'll wonder if you've mistakenly wandered into the bargain movie theater and you're watching Contagion because the movie starts with all of these news clips reporting details about a massive quarantine and all these deaths due to something like the swine flu. Don't worry - it's the right movie. Basically, the human population is getting wiped out from disease that was spread by the apes that were getting tested on in the first movie. The movie finally starts about 10 years later and Caesar is wondering if there are any humans left, because they haven't seen any sign of them in 2 years.  Proving Caesar has incredible timing, his question is answered when his son and another ape run into a group of hikers in the wood.. Long story short - they're trying to get to some giant dam or something to set up a power source for this group of humans that have survived. They need the power for survival, and also to communicate with the rest of the world to see who else has survived the epidemic. The problem: the apes don't trust humans and humans don't trust the apes.

The rest of the movie is pretty much apes and humans tiptoeing around each other because they don't trust the other after the events of the first movie, both parties getting along to the point of not wanting to start a huge war, until Koba goes and starts trouble. After that, all chaos breaks loose. I thought the movie was really action-packed and intense at parts. I loved it! Even the scenes I giggled at during the previews (where the apes were riding on horses and looking ridiculous) ended up being pretty good in the actual movie.",1406246400,153,2052,4.466666666666667
5228055,3,B0090SI4BA,"I did enjoyed this movie. I found it entertaining and interesting. I would gladly encourage anyone to go watch it on the big screen. However, It lost me in the final battle.

First, the humans were at such of a disadvantage by being on high ground and knowledge of US military weaponry.

Too bad they didn't have any of the weapons the apes found that were fully preloaded with MAX AMMO.

Second, How utterly amazing it was on how many humans Koba was able to down by riding a horse at full gallop with guns blazing. No need for spare clips since they had infinite ammo. They must have had the cheat codes on because he was able to charge a tank with machine guns bearing down, disable it and kill the 3 men inside.

Third, and where did those infinite amount of apes come from?

5228056,4,B0090SI4BA,"Unlike most summer CGI blockbusters, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" has a lot on its mind. Other reviews will tell you about the film's technical bravura; this review focuses on content. And for those who complain that Amazon reviews of movies should cover the ""product"" (e.g., DVD extras, picture ratio, sound quality), I say if the movie itself is not worth seeing, the fanciest DVD package in the world won't make it any better.

""Simian flu"" has wiped out most of the human population. A few hundred survivors are crowded into the Ferry Building and (interesting choice) the Federal Reserve Bank building in San Francisco, where they are about to run out of fuel. Across the Golden Gate Bridge in the fog-soaked forests of Marin County, a large colony of apes led by Caesar (the wonderful Andy Serkis in a performance capture suit) has built a complex society.

The humans need to bring a dam in Caesar's territory back into operation to restore power to the city. Dreyfus, the leader of the humans, wants to cross the bridge with guns blazing and take over the dam, while Malcolm, an engineer, wants to see if he can convince Caesar to let the humans stay in his territory just long enough to get the dam working without a conflict. Caesar is reluctantly willing to let the humans get to work on the dam, but his chief lieutenant Koba hates and mistrusts humans.

It's a summer action blockbuster so you can guess how that's going to turn out. But what's really quite wonderful about ""Dawn"" is how fervently the audience hopes that Malcolm and Caesar's approach will prevail and apes and humans can each meet their needs while peacefully co-existing in their separate spaces.  You think about how our experiences shape our approach to the world. Caesar was raised by a gentle human who taught him to talk while Koba was the victim of human lab experiments. You realize how easy it is, subjectively, to be suspicious of those who are different from you and how hard it is to trust. At the same time, when you look at the situation from outside, as the movie audience does, you see that peaceful solutions are possible, rational and vastly preferable. I kept thinking about Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. You also see that if you prepare for war, that's what you're likely to get.

If you just want action sequence after action sequence, you will probably find the pace of ""Dawn"" a bit slow for your liking. If you want a movie where one side is good and the other bad, you wont' like ""Dawn"" because there are ""good"" and ""bad"" characters on both sides, and even the ""bad"" characters have their reasons. But I was moved by what the movie had to say, and I liked how the filmmakers made the apes such distinctive characters--a very impressive use of performance capture. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the human characters, who are little more than cardboard cutouts, so I docked a star off my rating.",1405987200,5,2921,4.653100775193798
5228057,4,B0090SI4BA,"Overall, I would say it is a ""very good"" movie; well directed, acted, and shot. The plot was solid, if a bit predictable; I can't really call relying on tropes an error per se, but I like my movie plots to surprise me if they can. However, there was one moment near the end (no spoilers!) where I thought they would follow the norm but was pleasantly surprised by a decision of Caesar's.

Speaking of whom; I really couldn't care less about the Oscars at this point, it's all a popularity contest and a farce. But in a utopia where every truly brilliant movie, director and actor were duly recognized, Andy Serkis in my opinion would be top of the list for his captivating and brilliant portrayal of Caesar the ape. With fewer spoken lines than any movie character I can think of, he manages to portray in turns, using only slight facial movements and body language, such depth, anger, and even majesty (we're talking about a CGI chimpanzee here!) that I felt myself enthralled by this stunning performance.

 Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke also turned in impressive performances; I would, however, have liked to see more of Oldman. For the short times he was on screen, he was very good, several steps above functional.

There are genuinely touching moments, and a very well put together theme of what, truly, is the difference between the humans and the apes?

So, though it is too predictable for me to call it brilliant, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is entertaining, action packed, and features the best lead performance from any movie so far this year. And honestly I'm not expecting it to be topped. So I'm feeling a decent to strong 7 / 10 on this one.",1405987200,3,1661,4.579124579124579

The music is not used throughout the movie as much as others, but brings great aid to some very emotional scenes. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly from start to end, and there weren't any painfully slow or dull moments. As for the rating, this movie is very violent, and contains one f bomb. If you liked the first film, you'll probably enjoy this one even more. Not half bad!",1405900800,142,634,4.474137931034483
5228059,4,B0090SI4BA,"Seems to me that, once upon a time, most sequels were el-stinko. But, as of late, that has changed and they have either matched, or surpassed the originals. This is a sequel worthy of its predecessor.

Here's the scoop. It's ten years since the apes have had their brain power increased. However, the virus responsible for the new found intelligence has also wiped out most of the human population on the planet. Caesar and his folk have set up camp in the woods of the Northwest. One day they are happened upon by a small band of humans who are looking for the power plant set up on the nearby dam. They want to restore power to their section of the nearby city and get civilization back on track. Things don't go so well.

This sports a genuinely good script. Caesar has good memories of his 'master' and is not unwilling to let the humans do their thing. Likewise Jason Clarke has no beef with the apes and just wants to do his job and get the power plant up and running. But some in either camp hold animosities so it's a play to see which sensibility will triumph. This friend/enemy tug of war inches along evenly throughout the film with hope and despair being doled out in equal measure. It really had me riding the pendulum. And it plays right up to the final scene.

The production is great. Andy Serkis is great as Caesar. Jason Clarke has quickly risen to an actor I want to keep an eye on. Gary Oldman is always worth watching and, as the head of the human clan, was given just enough of a back story to not paint him as a two dimensional bad guy. Likewise, Toby Kebble, as Koba, gives every reason he thinks the humans should be decimated. The effects are top shelf. The production design, likewise, adds great mood to the proceedings. The climactic battle scene was staged and directed well. I generally like director Matt Reeves' work and he doesn't disappoint here.

5228060,4,B0090SI4BA,"Pierre Boulles 1963 novel La Planete des Singes spawned many Planet of the Apes movies that spans nearly 50-years, beginning with the classic Charlton Heston film in 1968. All of which have the same theme that appears to never get old; the fragility of humanity and the senselessness of war. This version, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the follow up to 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Im not too sure theres much of a difference between the words Rise and Dawn, but thats beside the point.

I could nit-pick a few nickel and dime flaws in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but the essence of the franchise and its meaning is alive and well. 2011s Rise was an okay movie with a small plot and a cool Caesar ape portrayed by Andy Serkis who is quickly becoming a legend of playing CGI characters; Gollum, King Kong and now Caesar. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a huge step up from Rise in nearly every way possible.

If you thought Caesar was cool in Rise, wait until you see Dawn. In 1968, Planet of the Apes set a standard for makeup and costuming by creating a community of apes that looked amazing. Now days, watching 1968s Planet, we are no longer amazed at guys and girls in monkey suits. The motion capture technology in Dawn has set a new standard, just as Planet did back then. Although as good as it is, effects alone do not make a movie.

Dawn isn't complicated. Youd think that it would be as the name portrays, but it really isnt. Co-existence is apparently a tough thing to practice in the real world and in monkey/human movies. That is pretty much the nuts and bolts of the movie. It isn't done on a grand scale, as the word planet implies, but in a small mountainous area. Ideals collide and symbolic struggles begin.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a really good movie and a big step up from its predecessor, but it certainly isn't without some mild flaws. The biggest of those in my opinion, wasn't the small scale of the film but in one final motivation right before the credits rolled that took everything you learned throughout the film about Caesar and tossed it out the window. Fortunately, they saved that until the very ending and it doesnt ruin a really good time at the movies.",1405900800,3,2217,4.3607748184019375

During the opening credits we quickly discover the ALZ 113 virus has killed off many humans creating a quarantine condition which for some unexplained reason caused rioting and killing off more humans. In spite of the weak plot point, it was more probable then the original dog/cat virus which lead to breeding apes with long gestation periods as pets.

The film spends time building ape character with perfect English syntax subtitles. In this plot, our quarantined humans are running short on fuel and seek to restart a hydro-electric dam in ape territory and seem willing to go to war for oil, er ah, energy if need be. Koba, a neo-con ape, doesn't trust the humans and wants to have a first strike. (Koba was a nickname for Stalin.)

Some of the initial soundtrack and imagery reminded me of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" with later scenes of cooperation reminiscent of the final film and TV series. There was nothing bad about the CG apes, except they got their money's worth from them. The ape on ape fighting was far too long, reminding me of that first Iron Man film.

The human characters are cardboard, the apes are depicted as the highest moral species conceivable. Of course everything is the fault of the humans, and the film maker actually takes this point of view seriously. He ACTUALLY appears to believe that humans are a failed species in comparison to apes. Thus we are greeted to many many (MANY) scenes of the apes in their idyllic family settings saying things such as ""An ape will never harm another ape"" (oh yeah, right). The anti-gun hysteria in the film is also treated with the gravest liberal-style seriousness. See, according to the film, its guns that are the main problem, and that make the humans evil. Once the apes get hold of the guns and are ""infected"" by NRA style thinking they descend to our own level, though once they put the guns aside they again become idyllic creatures of God.

It became Jacobs' dream project, facing an uphill battle with skeptical executives. Not helping the producer's cause was Boulle's public statement, calling ""Monkey Planet"" his worst novel.*

Rod Serling and Michael Wilson co-wrote the screen adaptation for Planet of The Apes (1968), which is far more Twilight Zone in construction than Boulle. Jacobs wisely cast Charlton Heston in the lead role. Heston, who loved the script, was helpful in influencing studio heads to green light and assign director Franklin J. Shaffner, who the actor had worked with in the underrated The War Lord (1965).

Studio misgivings were laid aside when Planet of the Apes (1968) proved to be a monstrous success. Before Star Wars, Batman, etc, Planet of the Apes was the original blockbuster franchise, spawning four sequels, a short-lived television series, an animated series, and a comic book. The original film still retains its classic pop status, despite revisionist opinions, usually by those who have not seen it and dismiss it as a cheesy byproduct of the sixties and seventies. Actually, it is science fiction at its most preferable: the cinematic equivalent of Cracker Jacks with its prize being smart dumb fun amidst caramel popcorn and salty peanuts. Who, in all honesty, would find  Kubrick's academic  psychedelia 2001: A Space Odyssey, made the same year, as fun an experience as American icon Heston being put through Sterling's pulp karma in the form of gorillas on horseback? Heston's Col. Taylor, disdainful of mankind, is replete with character flaws, yet we root for him as he is catapulted through a physical and emotional nightmare, in which he is forced to do a philosophical about-face, only to learn he was right all along. Heston's physicality  perfectly responds to Sterling's blunt ironies. It is the hippest performance of the actor's career and one can understand his hesitancy regarding the sequel; Beneath The Planet Of The Apes (1970).

Heston's performance here amounts to a cameo, with James Franciscus filling in, albeit with a second rate imitation. Still, once past the unnecessary rehash of the first film, Beneath, in its innovative second half,proves to be the strangest, most underrated of the franchise. It is also the only sequel, which retained the original's flavor.

Escape From The Planet Of The Apes (1971), the best of the sequels, benefits from the quirky performances of Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell. Writer Paul Dehn crafts an inventive, humor-laden narrative that delights in seventies pop culture. Dehn, a noted film critic, drew, in part, off Rod Sterling's original script draft for the first film, as well as Boulle's novel, in which Apes and humans coexist in a modern society. The Sterlingesque first half gives way to Dehn's pre-apocalyptic sensibilities and pop social commentary on racism and violence.

Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes (1972) is literally Bazooka Bubble Gum armageddon,especially in the unrated version, found on home video. The slavery theme, in the decade immediately following the civil rights battle, made Conquest an enormously popular entry and Dehn sells the preposterousness of it by sheer style alone.

Battle for the Planet of The Apes (1973) fatally erred by switching horses in the middle of the ride (i.e. taking script-writing duties away from Dehn). The result was hopelessly dull family fare pretension with a vapid happy, happy, joy, joy intolerable New Age peace and harmony ending, which contradicts everything before it. The short-lived television seres, while hardly classic, was a slight step-up. By now the reputation of the original suffered from overexposure and the inevitable law of diminishing returns.

After Tim Burton's failed, all gloss re-boot from 2001, Twentieth Century Fox waited a full decade before handing the new Apes project over to producer and writer Rick Jaffa (among others), feeling the time was ripe to right Burton's wrong. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) justified their patience. Director Rupert Wyatt and actor Andy Serkis were considerable assets to the film's critical and box office success. Rise is the first Apes to utilize CGI and the results are mixed. The primary detractions come in form of egregious homages to the original film, including Heston's infamous line, which is rendered a disservice to this wily pulp. Rise also set a new pattern in dull human counterparts. James Franco is adrift and his brow beating may possibly have been the result of realizing he had been upstaged. Freida Pinto is wasted, reduced to decor. The only genuine interaction between actors is found in John Lithgow's Alzheimer victim with Serkis' remarkable turn as Caesar. Rise is also water logged with the most vapid and dull of subplots: the big bad wolf capitalist executive playing havoc with science for profit, before his inevitable comeuppance. The epic social underpinnings of the 1968 original are scaled down to a commentary on animal testing, but one that smartly yields to a revamping of Conquest. Wyatt's stylish direction mostly overcomes the sloppy writing. Flaws, aside Rise was successful enough to warrant this year's entry.

A sequel was planned from the beginning, with Serkis returning for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), directed by Matt Reeves, who previous credits include Cloverfield (2008) and Let Me In (2010). Some critics are hailing Dawn as the best of the entire Apes franchise, and although a distinct improvement over its immediate predecessor, this proves to be a slight exaggeration, but only slight. As Rise was conscientious folklore retelling of Conquest, Dawn uses Battle for a diving board and, fortunately, transforms its source (the worst of the Apes films) into one of the best.

Dawn, with returning writers Jaffa and Amanda Silver, repeats some of the missteps of Rise. Homages to the original abound and still serve as distractions. However, new writer Mark Bomback seems to have  assisted in upping the ante (although his resume would not indicate that potential) delivering a script with the primary message that Them is synonym to Bigotry.

Dawn,like the best Apes films, has a Rod Sterlingesque sheen, but it also indebted to Dehn's somber, subtle as weapons of mass destruction apes branded social commentary. Additionally, there is a distant aesthetic relationship to Budd Boetticher's hyper complex, cryptic character prism filtered through the sensibilities of independent filmmaking (despite being a big studio enterprise). It is, or rather should be within our nature to root for the underdog, but as in a Boetticher film, we are unsure just who the underdog is. Both simian and human are prone to profiling and race demonization, but often this is borne through desperate struggle to survive, rather than being a genetic trait. Although,the shading is laudably complex, Dawn, like Rise, slightly falters in a vital area; the human counterparts themselves are mostly a dull lot with only a few performances rising above sketchiness. On the other hand, focusing primarily on the apes proves to be a good choice.

Aided by motion capture, Serkis' powerhouse performance as Caesar is even more impressive this time around and is the most, if not the only, successful collaboration between actor and CGI to date and, unlike the recent Spiderman travesty, the effects are utilized only to strengthen performance and narrative.  Although clearly the protagonist, Caesar is fallible and fears change, which is Dawn's second big theme, practically splattered on us through a bull horn, which is hardly a criticism. Almost matching Serkis is Toby Kebbell's performance as the radical militant Koba. It is a given that Dawn will not be a favorite among a good number of NRA members or George W. Bush foreign policy fans, but Kebbell avoids degenerating into cartoon territory, which would have been easy to do. His Koba is not entirely without sympathy and understandable motive. A third, notable performance is found in Karin Konoval's reprise of the orangutan; Maurice (the name being a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr. Zaius in the 1968 original). Maurice has taken on the mantle of a pedagogical simian. Anti-war, anti-racism, pro-gun control, pro-civil law, and pro-education, Dawn Of The Planet Of the Apes, is, quite possible, rendered a summer nightmare for obtuse summer blockbuster zealots and social media forum kooks.

Some criticisms have been leveled against this film for its preachiness and pacing. Aesthetically echoing its message that trust is hard earned, Dawn is more akin to a thought out, gradually convincing us homily as opposed to a banging-the pulpit Transformers sermon. Yet, this is not a summer move devoid of visceral excitement. Indeed, it is a rare, flavorful popcorn, aided immensely by Michael Giacchino's score, building to a dynamic, Orwellian crescendo.

* Boulle had previously written the novel Bridge on the Rive Kwai' received credit for the screenplay, but declined to show up for the Academy Award. The reason for the no-show was that Boulle did not write the script, but agreed to receive credit for the film's backlisted writers.

5228066,4,B0090SI4BA,"Of all the cheesy canons of film history to reboot and retool for the 21st  century, who would have ever thought that Planet of the Apes would become one of the best? Remember, the 1968 original is where we get the classic Charlton Heston line ""Take your stinking paws off of me, you damned dirty ape."" In 2001, Tim Burton attempted to revive the series, but he did a remake of the original starring Heston and Roddy McDowall. Burtons stars? Mark Wahlberg and Tim Roth are pretty even replacements for the stars of the original. It wasn't that successful for two reasons. 1. It was a remake of the cheesy original using slightly better special effects. 2. It didn't have Andy Serkis in a motion capture suit.

In 2011, Fox decided to reboot the series with Rise of the Planet of the Apes starring James Franco as a scientist looking for a cure for Alzheimers to help cure his father (John Lithgow). He brings Caesar (Andy Serkis), one of the test apes at the lab, home and they form a very unique bond as Caesar learns to communicate with sign language and through speech. Then everything goes wrong. It was an engaging blockbuster made even better by Serkis performance.

Now, three years later, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes arrives at the multiplex.

Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), the story picks up ten years later. The human race has been decimated by the 'Simian Flu' and the apes have been multiplying, teaching themselves how to communicate, and multiplying. A colony of humans has holed up in the Ferry Building in run-down, overgrown San Francisco. A group of them venture into the forest and Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who has wandered ahead, is surprised by a group of apes. He shoots Ash, the son of Koba (Toby Kebbell, The Escape Artist) and starts a confrontation. Caesar runs to the sight and confronts the rest of the humans led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke, Zero Dark Thirty, Lawless, The Great Gatsby) and they reach an uneasy truce. When the humans return to the city, their leader, Dreyfuss (Gary Oldman) is very worried about a possible attack. But Malcom talks them out of any action and asks them to let him travel back and talk to the apes about letting them get a power station at a dam running again. Their power supply is running out, so this new generator could mean their survival. Each group has a voice of dissent causing problems;  Koba doesnt share Caesars tolerance for humans, he was tested on and scarred by humans, but Caesar is their leader, so he acquiesces, for a while. Dreyfus doesnt share Malcoms trust for the apes and would prefer to wipe them out. But he allows Malcolm to try things his way. Both are working towards conflict as their more level-headed counterparts try to resolve their differences.

Computer-generated-imagery (or CGI) has taken over pretty much every film you might see at the multiplex. This advancement allows filmmakers to create new worlds or to recreate worlds of the past. Anything someone can imagine can now be created for a film. The key is how well it is created. In so many films, CGI is used to create a monster, a dragon or scary creature, something meant to shock and scare us near the end of a film. CGI works less well when it is used for the majority of the film, creating landscapes, buildings, characters, special effects. Our eyes need something real to focus on, to trick us into believing the CGI is real. If everything is created artificially, something usually falters and our eye finds it. Unless the work is really, really good.

In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the work is really, really good. Every ape character, and there are many, is created by an actor in a motion capture suit. They basically act the role wearing motion capture suits, in front of a camera. The special effects people take that footage and combine it with CGI, the animation matching various points on the suits to create more realistic characters. In the last few years, this technology has advanced to help create some truly remarkable creations in some really memorable films.

And pretty much all of these characters are played by Andy Serkis. The Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, King Kong, a character in the upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron, a character in the upcoming Star Wars film. Lets face it. The Gollum is the character everyone remembers and quotes. King Kong doesn't work unless we believe in the performance of a  giant ape. All of these are accomplished by Andy Serkis and a bunch of special effects geeks. In Rise and now Dawn, he makes Caesar come alive, he makes him a real, viable character in these narratives. It really feels like they trained a real ape and gave him a script. But of course that didn't happen. One of the advances made in this technology is they are able to capture facial movements, allowing the actors to add this to their performance, removing another layer of artificiality, giving their characters a higher degree of authenticity. Serkis does an amazing job bringing Caesar to life. We see and feel every emotion the ape feels, every interaction he has with his fellow apes and with the humans, he seems real. He is Caesar.

As the head of the pack, Caesar has a lot to contend with- humans, who are pretty much distrusted by all apes, dissent within the pack, family sickness. But he can never show weakness and that is the first thing you realize about Caesar; he is strong, very strong. But his mind is always working. If he trusts Malcolm, will Koba and the others perceive this as a weakness and try to take over? If he doesnt show any kindness to the humans, will they immediately attack? Caesar seems to consider every action he and his pack make, weighing whether it will lead them closer to an all-out conflict with the humans. He doesnt seem to want war and tries to do everything he can to prevent it.

It is really an extraordinary performance. It is because of Serkis work we are so willing to accept this world created by director Reeves and all of his technicians. And Serkis is receiving a lot of attention for his work in this capacity, he seems to be the innovator, the Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Ray Harryhausen, or James Cameron of this new technology.

But Serkis is not the only actor playing an ape. Toby Krebbel (a very bad human being in The Escape Artist) plays Koba, the ape who constantly challenges Caesar. He is a good villain and the performance is worthy of any not enhanced by CGI. Judy Greer plays Caesars wife Cornelia. And other actors play different apes in the group, some of whom support Caesar, some dont.

The actors playing human roles are good, but each is a little flat, a little one-dimensional. Malcolm, as played by Jason Clarke, is the good guy. He only wants to work out a deal with the apes so they can get to the dam and get the power plant running. He is only ever good or caring. Given what he has gone through in the last decade, you might expect a least a glimmer of darkness. Keri Russell plays Ellie, a former doctor who now lives with Malcom and his son, Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, The Road). Kirk Acevedo plays Carver, who basically starts all of the confrontations because he is one of those shoot first, figure things out later types. Gary Oldman plays Dreyfus who is meant to be the human version of Caesar. While he is less interested in maintaining the peace, you can see that he is frightened by these genetically evolved apes and wants to try to exert the humans perceived superiority with the cache of firearms they control. Oldman is good, but he doesn't convey the complexity of Serkis' ape counterpart.

And that is really astonishing. The actors playing humans are less effective than the work from the actors who have to deal with a bunch of technical restrictions and gadgetry. There was a time, very recently, when that would not have been the case and I would be criticizing the work of the CGI characters for not being human enough.

There are some moments of interaction between apes and humans, both good and bad. An orangutan named Maurice is the teacher to the younger apes. At one point, he ventures to the humans campsite and shares a moment with Alexander. Later, Koba and two of his followers, discover the humans testing a cache of weapons at Ft. Point. Malcolm and Ellie venture into the ape compound and when Ellie realizes Cornelia is sick she offers to help with some medicine.

Each of these films is being used to set-up the next. The original series ran for five films and spawned a television series and then a series of television movies. Dawn ends with a brief scene setting up the next film. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, there is a brief shot of a news program following the launch of the Icarus. This is the name of the ship Charlton Hestons character is on when it lands on the Planet of the Apes. I would guess that there are probably two more films planned before the Icarus returns to Earth. They are already floating internet stories about the return of the Icarus, but it seems that the set-up of the next film would be before this spaceship returns to Earth.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an example of what all the other filmmakers want to achieve when they make these remakes and reboots. A film that makes people forget about the original because it is so darned good.",1405468800,21,9332,4.5951951951951955
5228067,5,B0090SI4BA,"If anyone's minded to poke holes in this movie, have a blast. As with any movie, there are nits to pick, and that's how some people enjoy themselves.

For me, this was truly outstanding in just about every way. First, the characters. They really build sympathy for Caesar and his family. They really bring out the hawks-vs.-doves debates that currently rage in our government about conflicts in today's headlines, but bring the issues down to a more personal scale. And, as in today's headline issues, the peace-makers on both sides have worse enemies within ""their side"" than among the nominal enemies. The war is man vs. ape, but the real conflict is between those on both sides who want to coexist vs. those on both sides who don't. And I just plain like some of the non-humans, especially Maurice.

Then, there are the effects. Motion-captured CGI has never been better. Skin and fur render beautifully, and motion is completely natural despite the human actors being differently proportioned than the ape characters. There aren't any CGI scenes of apocalyptic devastation, the kind that other movies use to such good effect. Instead, like the characters themselves, effects come down to a more personal level. And, because the imagery is so effective, it's easy to accept the apes as real - well, real enough.

The ""Apes"" franchise has been running for decades. Despite some unfortunate efforts early on, this and another recent addition to the Apes canon show that it's still going strong. If the scriptwriters and effect-meisters keep performing at this level, I'll look forward to more in this series.

5228068,2,B0090SI4BA,"Hollywood has been churning out 3D films by the score. Maybe 40% of the films that actually use 3D do justice to it. But there are some films where the film-makers just to fill their coffers retrofit 3D in the animations and Dawn of the planet of the Apes is one such film. So the movie going audience have to deal with many things. a) they have to wear 3D glasses, wipe the glasses/worry about hygiene b) deal with decreased brightness. We are all used to brightness at 80% so imagine watching the graphics because the graphics in this film fit only 35% of the brightness otherwise c) pay more money for the ticket.

About the use of 3D in this film - it is unimpressive, it is unrequired, graphics are ok.. I found myself irritated to the point of also lifting the glasses. This happened with Avengers as well. I understand the film maker wants to use the 3D vision to spread the charisma and message of the film but in this particular film it is a complete failure. They should take a leaf out of Life of Pi or even The Great Gatsby where I felt the graphics did true justice to the viewing experience. Until then many of us will feel cuckolded.

About the story, there is really not much. You will follow everything from the trailer and it picks up from there. There is a use of a lot of poor imagination, poor characterization of humans, the protagonist of humans looked like a retired 1999 soap series actor and acted terribly. None of the characters played by the humans sold any consequence or added any functional foreplay to the drama.

The apes on the other hand were pretty good. Whats most unique about the film is that you end up supporting a different breed over the humans. This is unforeseen and remarkable.  However, the formulaic predictable sequences and actions, the apes and how much assumption and drama has gone into them is truly bizarre. I just couldn't take them seriously because the story was bad, the graphics were distracting, the screen too low in brightness, the beginning too scanty, many 5-7 minute intervals where you could ""literally snooze"" than watch this film. The apes respawn like God knows what is creating them.

Overall, if you are watching this before watching the prequel, there is a chance you will like it more.
But if like me you saw the last film, you will feel they left out a very intrinsic element of the first film.

Dawn of the planet apes fails both as a film and a story. The graphics marred by the film makers trying to retrospectively fit 3D into a film that didn't require 3D. The 3D actually took away from the plot. It seemed apologetic. The apes were realistic enough on 2D. With so many flaws in the story, the acting of the humans and the flawed 3D experiences, I regret to say I felt robbed of my time and respect for a series I had built up over 2 decades ago.",1405382400,3,2828,4.44980694980695
5228069,5,B0090SI4BA,"They are very popular, proud, and highly respected American media franchises that were nearly destroyed by horrible movie iterations.  Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001) remake was a big money maker, but it was generally derided by science fiction fans and critics alike. And Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin (1997) film was a complete and utter disaster. Common characteristics of these two misguided films were:  the employment of directors who did not respect the source material; the miscasting of pretty boy actors -George Clooney and Mark Walberg- as the titular characters; and really bad costumes.  Whenever I think about George Clooney's nipple suit I have to shake my head in disgust.

After those two disastrous films were released into theatres, and then subsequently excoriated by fans and critics alike, it was thought by many that the prospects for additional films for both of these franchises had become nil.  In the case of Batman some thought that the entire media franchise had been dealt a blow that it would not be able to recover from.  That was until Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale collaborated on the film that reinvigorated the Batman franchise (Batman Begins) and revolutionized the comic book film; and then they followed up that collaboration with one of the best movie sequels in the history of film (The Dark Knight). The Planet of the Apes franchise is experiencing a similar revitalization with the release of The Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) movies.

One of the best things about the last two Planet of the Apes films is that the most important character in the film (Caesar) is played by a ""character"" actor by the name of Andy Serkis.  A prospective one billion dollar movie franchise rests on the shoulders of an average looking actor whose talent, work ethic, and passion for the material informs his performance.  Isn't that awesome!  And Andy Serkis is wonderful as Caesar in both films.  In addition to his astute physical performance as Caesar, Serkis infuses Caesar with many emotional layers.  Caesar is tasked with the heavy burden of being the leader of his species, and through his performance as Caesar, Serkis clearly conveys this burden to the audience.  I wish that the Golden Globes and the Oscars would take a chance and nominate less conventional acting performances for these award shows.  Serkis is deserving of award recognition for his performance in Apes.

The movie itself takes place in post-apocalyptic San Francisco ten years after the inception of a deadly virus (created by human scientists) which has left the human population nearly extinct. In the former city of San Francisco there exists a colony of humans who struggle every day to survive.  Caesar's apes exist in the forest near San Francisco, but unlike their desperate human counterparts the apes are thriving.  The apes have created their own society which is governed by the laws of their own making.  They have ample amounts of food, they raise their children, and their lives are peaceful.  That peace is disturbed by a group of human explorers that invade their land. The initial encounter between these humans and the apes leads to a violent confrontation.  Caesar prevents this initial confrontation from leading to a war, but he warns the humans that further incursion into apes lands will not be tolerated. Humans and apes have a healthy distaste for one another, but one of the humans (Malcolm) is impressed by Caesar.

The humans are in desperate need of energy.  The ape lands are situated on the path that leads to the dam that the humans believe can be harnessed for energy. So at the insistence of Malcolm (Jason Clarke), one of the leaders of the human colony, a small band of humans once again venture into the ape lands.  Malcolm is taken as a prisoner by the apes and put before Caesar for judgment.  The judgment morphs into a sort of bargain with Malcolm being able to persuade Caesar of the purity of the humans' intentions.  After a while a tentative trust is built between Caesar and Malcolm.  Caesar even enlists some of his apes to help the humans harness the potential energy from the dam. But not every human, or every ape for that matter, is keen on an open truce between the humans and the apes, and these troublemakers do all that they can to disturb the peace.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is suffused with a healthy amount of allegory. The movie is a parable about racism, greed, war, trust, and forgiveness. When combining these salient topics with the performances and special effects in the film something truly wonderful is created.  I have already extolled the virtues of Serkis' performance as an ape; in fact all of the actors who play the apes are great. However, we should not forget about the humans who play humans in this film. They are essential to the function of the movie and they should be commended for their performances as well.  I highly recommend this film for viewing.  And if the rest of this review does not help you just think about how cool it would be to see apes riding on horseback.",1405296000,5,5136,4.816628701594533

It was a perfect storm of great performances, great storytelling, and great effects work.  It takes an outlandish concept and treats it so earnest that you begin to really believe that this future could one day be ours.

From the beginning the tension never lets up.  This is a land mine of a film that is just waiting for the right amount of pressure to blow things wide open.  When the tension finally builds to the inevitable payoff, the film does not disappoint.  It let me feeling very emotional.  There are still things from this movie, two days out, that are still dancing around in my head.  This film is adult science fiction storytelling done right.

I would watch again.  The problem I think is that these movies are setting it up for more movies and this one may not be the best in the series, but more the worst in the series even though it's not that bad.
It's worth a watch but would have been nice to see a little more of the surviving humans side of things and maybe showing what the world was like before this colony was started.

5228083,5,B0090SI4BA,"There may be spoilers. Set 10 years from the time of the ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011), the known world has been essentially destroyed with the virus that was passed on by inoculated apes, killing most of the World's population.  The apes have evolved - at least those in the San Francisco area - and show not only true emotions but rudimentary speech.  Led by the now fully grown and fully in charge Caesar (Andy Serkis, who created the character in 2011 film), the apes have established a habitat suitable for their species, north of the city in Mt. Tamalpais.

When a pair of apes on a hunting mission come across a human (Kirk Acevedo), with a gun of course, things get a bit more complicated.  It appears that some humans were immune from the original disease and now inhabit a tower in the city center.  A small crew had been looking for a water powered electrical facility.  Their group is led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke).  The expected confrontation comes but the humans are surprised that Caesar just kicks them out even though one of their own was mortally wounded.

Malcolm and his party return to the city.  The governor of the humans, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) begins to prep for a future event by arming the human citizenry with military weapons.  Malcolm convinces Dreyfus to give him time to reason with the apes in order to get to the power plant without a major conflict.  This appears to work as Caesar allows the small group to work as long as their weapons are destroyed.  Alas, like civilization today, there are individuals in each group, believing that conflict is better served by warfare.

What makes the film substantial is the excellent interaction between the two sides.  The humanity that has leaked into the apes shows itself with compassion as well as an aggressive need to fight...and kill.  The humans, in fact, are the same, thus the not so veiled comparisons.  It should also be noted that director Matt Reeves and his special effects crew have upped the motion-capture bar beyond the original ""Rise,"" ""Avatar"" and others.  Check out the extreme close-ups of the apes.  Serkis and Toby Kebbell (""East"") are also the best performers in the film.  Kebbell's Koba presents the challenge to Caesar's authority which becomes vicious and very human-like.  While the film focuses on the interaction between the species, there are also some excellent battles that eventually ensue.  While I enjoyed the ""Rise"" film, this one is better entertainment on all levels.  Highly recommended.

(BLU RAY 3-D UPDATE) Feb. 28, 2015

It was time to take another look at this second of three films which provided a reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" saga which began in 1967.  This time, I'll be looking primarily at the 3-D Blu ray version which is available on one of two discs.  The second disc includes the 2-D version and a host of bonus material.  I won't rehash the film itself, but suffice it to say that I enjoyed it just as much as when I first saw it on a huge screen.

The film has many dark scenes throughout which would seem to pose quite a challenge to recreate in 3-D.  For the early parts of the film the 3-D is very restrained, although it was used very effectively in the daylight scenes deep into a wooded area near San Francisco.  The overall detail of the film is excellent in this 1080p video resolution disc(s).  The transfer maintains the film's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While the early portions are restrained, the 3-D is used to great effect in the final act as the apes battle the humans in their ""tower"" home.  While this isn't the best use of 3-D that I've seen, it is certainly serviceable and entirely enjoyable.

There are no compromises necessary in the stunning DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  It rumbles the subs with astounding galloping horses and deer, not to mention the closing battle.

Ape vs. human war is fun to watch, but as well as kick-ass explosions and lots of shooting, this story manages to subtly show what makes the characters and communities tick. Feelings and Firearms: an A-grade mix.",1405209600,2,458,4.4523809523809526
5228085,4,B0090SI4BA,"Caeser (Andy Serkis) just wants to live in peace with his ape family. When a group of humans show up, led by a couple Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Kerri Russel); paranoia becomes an issue. The humans don't know if they can trust the apes and vice versa.
  Even when Caeser and Malcolm grow closer, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman)  of the humans and Koba (Toby Kebbell) of the apes don't see peace an option. Koba who was caged and tested on in the first film and has the scars to show for it; doesn't think a good human exists. While most humans blame the apes for the virus that has killed most of mankind.
  The film is engaging, smart and just very well done. The scene where Koba fools two armed men into thinking he is just a dumb ape who just wandered there was a pretty brilliant scene. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes isn't just another brainless action summer film. It's pretty well paced and builds up towards the action nicely.

5228086,5,B0090SI4BA,"When Rise of the Planet of the Apes came out in 2011, it surprised everyone by being a thoroughly entertaining reboot to a 40-year-old franchise. Fast forward to today, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is set to surprise even more by being a complex and emotional epic that marks a high point for the series as a whole. The Apes movies have always been at their best when their plot lines serve as allegories for real-world issues. Throughout the series, the films have covered a wide array of topics, including religion, racism, evolution, animal rights, and more. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (hereafter referred to as ""Dawn"") picks up the mantle by telling a pointed (anti) war story about the fundamental things that make us human. And what better way to explore some of our most primal impulses regarding love, fear, and violence - and the ways in which they connect - than through a burgeoning society of intelligent apes?

The premise itself is time-honored and universal: two cultures collide, tensions rise, and the potential for conflict is ever-present, in this case between apes and humans who are struggling to survive after an apocalyptic epidemic. We've seen this concept numerous times before in films such as Dances With Wolves, The New World, and most recently, Avatar. Dawn separates itself, however, by telling this story in a fresh and exhilarating way. To start with, the ape culture is a marvelous thing to behold: simultaneously foreign and distinctly familiar all at once, the apes are unlike anything we've seen before, yet their culture mirrors that of our own primitive development. What's most impressive is how authentic everything feels, as if we're watching an alternate history captured on screen. The hunting tactics, the sign language, the pictograms, everything feels like it could come straight out of a National Geographic special. The thrill of seeing something truly marvelous in a blockbuster movie is rather rare these days, but the ape culture is genuinely awe-inspiring to behold.

While the human characters may not always be quite as interesting by comparison, they're still treated with compassion and subtlety. Minute for minute, the screen time of any given human character is relatively small, but their scenes do a lot with a little in allowing us to empathize with their plight. This is a film comprised largely of intimate moments between characters (both human and simian), and those moments carry a cumulative emotional and thematic weight that can't be ignored. Unlike certain other movies of this ilk, the filmmakers go out of their way not to demonize either culture, and indeed go even further by illustrating how conflict can just as readily come from within. This is a film that doesn't take sides, it simply shows us characters making choices to protect themselves and those closest to them. What is perhaps most refreshing of all is that the clich of ""the westerner who assimilates into the culture and saves the day"" is nowhere to be found; the filmmakers instead allow both sides to represent themselves, using emissaries to try and maintain a fragile state of peace.

Artistically and technically speaking, Dawn is a huge achievement. Matt Reeves showed what a talented filmmaker he was with his last film, Let Me In, and here he proves he's one of the best directors working in Hollywood. He's a master of his craft, and it shows in every frame of this film, which is filled with striking imagery, suspenseful set-pieces, and inspired cinematic flourishes. But perhaps most impacting of all is Reeves' sympathy for his characters. For all of its action and suspense, Dawn is a surprisingly moving story about family, and that compassion is what resonates most of all by film's end. That sensitivity is further bolstered by the amazing acting on display. Every actor is in top form here, and the ape characters in particular (led by the inimitable Andy Serkis as Caesar) display an astounding level of subtlety. The motion-capture CGI is spectacular, and this is coming from someone who is usually put off by CGI-driven movies. But that's just it: this movie is character-driven rather than CGI-driven. The special effects are always in service of the characters rather than the other way around, and that's one of the reasons Dawn transcends its blockbuster brethren.

When it comes down to it, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes contains everything we yearn for when we go to the movies; we want to be thrilled, we want to be moved, we want to escape, and ultimately, we want to find ourselves in the characters portrayed on-screen. It's a film of dynamic contradictions: both intimate and epic, soulful and savage, an exploration of the ape in every human and the human in every ape. Dawn gives us all of this in one marvelous package, and that's a pretty magnificent achievement for any movie, let alone a franchise blockbuster. Don't let the talking apes fool you; this is a deeply human story and a gripping science fiction film that does its namesake proud.",1405209600,3,5030,4.935064935064935
5228087,5,B0090SI4BA,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" [USA, 2014]

1. This extraordinary movie is gorgeous, gripping, and better than the first film. It's perhaps my favorite film of 2014 so far.

2. At the very end of the first movie, you get the idea that the viral drug being tested on apes has escaped the lab and is infecting humans. This movie takes place 10 years later, after the virus has killed most of humanity (including all the people from the first movie).

3. San Francisco is a shell of what it once was, and the relatively small group of humans that were immune to the virus are trying to hold themselves together. Meanwhile, the escaped apes, led by Caesar, are building their own society.

4. The San Francisco people, who don't know about the evolved apes, accidentally run into them and shoot one. This rather unfortunate meeting of the groups stirs emotions on all sides; the humans and the apes try to decide what to do with each other. There are more apes than humans, but humans have more guns.

5. The special effects in this movie are impossibly good. There were a couple of times that I stopped paying attention to the story because I was mesmerised by the apes. Speaking of special effects, Andy Serkis plays Caesar. He also played Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.

6. While it's obvious that the movie is making a commentary on war, if you like to read things into movies like I do, the movie is a reflection on so many other things: leadership, forgiveness, fanaticism, sacrifice, revenge, and choice. It really makes you think about where the boundaries are between humans and other animals.

7. There is a deep sadness and melancholy that soaks through the whole movie.

8. This is mostly a drama, so if you're expecting two hours of violence, you'll be disappointed. Most of the action comes during the last 45 minutes or so. The first hour and a half does a fantastic job of slowly building up the tension, so that when it blows up, it really blows up.

9. This is an excellent piece of filmmaking, especially considering it's supposed to be a summer blockbuster. You root for both the humans and the apes, which gets you all twisted up. You are drawn into this dark new world, and you leave it with both your intellect and your emotions affected.",1405209600,8,2298,4.544794188861985
5228088,5,B0090SI4BA,"I've been watching ""Planet of the Apes"" movies since 1968. The producers of those first series of films decided to squeeze every penny out of them they could and production values plummeted with the apes looking nothing more than actors in bad Halloween masks. This new series that started with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is the opposite of those first films and they're increasing production values, with writing and acting being kept at a high level. I can safely say this is one of the best movies I`ve seen in a while and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" should be nominated for an Academy Award (or two) for acting.

""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is the summer blockbuster movie you've been waiting for. You want action? You got it. You want believable characters you can relate to, who have believable motivations and emotions within the context of the world they're inhabiting, whether they're apes or human? You got it. You want expansive CGI and special effects that work with the story? You got it.

""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" picks up ten years after the events of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rise-Of-The-Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B006O5XYWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rise Of The Planet of the Apes</a>"". Caesar has become the leader of the apes living in the forests outside of San Francisco, he is also a father who cares for his family, and a wise leader who cares about the fate of his followers. The opposite side of the story is humans have been nearly wiped out by a ""simian flu"" the result of the genetic engineering in ""Rise"". The humans enclave is San Francisco and they're running out of power which leads them to send out a reconnaissance team to check on the feasibility of getting a dam operational again to provide their need for power, that's when humans and apes encounter each other. There is an epic quality to ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" that borders on the Biblical or mythological in that the mistakes made by both sides, as well as deception that make conflict an inevitability.

One of the marks of a good movie is that you can't predict what will happen, the artist doesn't make the safe or usual choices and keeps its audience guessing as to what happens. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" doesn't make any of the safe or usual choices. This is a movie you want to see and the movie to scale your expectations for future films.",1405209600,3,2423,4.764285714285714
5228089,5,B0090SI4BA,I cannot wait to see it again.  I saw it in the theater. It was amazing. The scene of the ape riding on horseback through the fire and guns blazing was unbelievable.,1405209600,2,165,4.15625
5228090,4,B0090SI4BA,"Although a little slower in the beginning while this 2014 movie covered some introductory stuff, the CGI was absolutely awesome throughout and the big-screen 3d was worth the couple of extra bucks.  We all know the basic storyline--apes and humans fight.  Certainly you have seen that much in the promos. This movie series has hung around since Charlton Heston did the original.  In case you have somehow missed these movies, Ceasar is the chimp on the movie cover.  He is the smart one, born of a mother who was given experimental altheimer drugs.  He was saved from slaughter, hidden, and taught to speak.  Many years later, he has a not-so-small army/extended family and they are living in the hills away from the humans.  Many humans have died from a virus infection and much of the human world is dead.  Just as Ceasar and his extended family are thinking ALL the humans are gone, a small party approaches them in the hills.  The humans are in search of an old dam, to use as a power source.

As the story evolves, the movie reminds us that apes and humans have good and bad beings, and the movie apes are very similar to humans and pretty smart.  The polarity between fear and control evidences itself in both species as apes and humans clash.  As always, there are those who want peace, and those who just want to control at any cost.  Control of whatever--could be a dung heap.  To many, power is justified to be claimed at the expense of others, and death is just collateral damage.  Let's also not forget that we just kill that which we fear and do not understand.  There are lessons to be had in this movie.  Obviously, there will be a follow-on movie.

I was between a 4 and 5 star on this one.  It was hard to pick.  The movie was well worth watching.",1405209600,,1764,4.470219435736677
5228091,5,B0090SI4BA,"2011 was a year that had a surprisingly cleverly crafted movie by the name of X-Men First Class. But perhaps most memorably, 20th Century Fox also released a movie by the name of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. No one, not even myself was prepared for the extraordinary film that I was about to witness. And now ladies and gentlemen if I can  contain my excitement and use a phrase to describe this review it would be: COME ONE  COME All and prepare yourself for my thrill and amazement with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

Set years later after the Rise, Caesar and a relatively large number of apes have taken refuge in the forest. Together, they live in harmony and together they are their own civilization. Caesar's son Blue Eyes and Caesar's nephew Ash decide to take a walk in the woods and that is when, they meet Carver who is a human. And unfortunately, this chance meeting does not go well.

Andy Serkis ladies and gentlemen,  truly is a master at the art of motion capture. SERIOUSLY. That distinctive look that Caesar possesses and the way he grabs the audience's attention is almost too good to be true. Caesar exemplifies his leadership by the sacrifices he is willing to make, and the love and respect he has for not just his own family but each individual ape. Serkis is excellent here, and is well deserving of the recognition he receives and more in my opinion.

Judy Greer has a nice outing as Caesar's companion Cornelia. Karin Konoval portrays Maurice the orangutan from Rise and does quite well once again. And Toby Kebell plays Koba who is our not so friendly antagonist of the movie.

On to the human characters, Jason Clarke stars in Dawn as Malcolm. It is he and Caesar who work to keep peace among their own respectable parties and in doing so,  an uncommon trust builds between them. I was not sure about him as an actor but he does a nicer than expected job with his portrayal. Kodi Smit McPhee ( known for movies Let Me In and The Road) stars as Malcolm's son Alexander and does a solid job. And finally, Gary Oldman (who I have the up most respect for as an actor) plays Dreyfus who is the commanding force for the remaining human group. And yes, the acting in Dawn IS wonderful.
How the apes talk is one thing, but how they look is something that can only be described as: majestic. Which brings me to my thoughts on the visuals and CGI. The apes look so SO good in the movie. The movements look real, the facial expressions are believable and above all else, Dawn has only great things to offer in terms of scenery and design. Whatever worries I had about Matt Reeves taking the directing chair quickly went away after viewing Dawn. Action, suspense, drama, and emotion from both the apes and the humans make this sequel a movie that is as equally as exceptional as it's predecessor, but a sequel that has a lot more surprises,  a lot more inescapable moments and obviously a lot more apes.

Yesterday, I bear witness to a movie that has a fulfilling story and an amazing cast to back it up.  Yesterday I realized that what we have is not only the best movies of the summer so far, but the WORLD has one of the best movies of 2014 here and now. And for these very reasons Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is most certainly a movie that is:

5228092,3,B0090SI4BA,"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the second in a series of reboots of the 1968 classic film.  The first of the new series (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) introduced us to Caesar, a genetically modified ape capable of sentient thought, reason, and eventually speech.  The end of that film set up both the decimation of the human race (through a genetically manufactured virus) and the rise of the apes (who take up residence in the forests beyond the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco).  This second film picks up ten years after the end of the first film - Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his tribe (which has grown exponentially in just a decade) are living a peaceful, family-centered life - their creed is ""apes do not kill apes.""  When a group of humans wander into their territory, a trigger-happy idiot (Kirk Acevedo) shoots and kills one young ape.  This creates not only the potential for war between the two species, but it's a real threat to Caesar's leadership.  Caesar believes strongly in peace, but his rival, Koba (Toby Kebbell), believes that the only good human is a dead human - this is not surprising considering the amount of torture and experimentation Koba was subjected to by human scientists.  So as much as Caesar struggles to maintain the peace (he's cooperative with the humans, who are trying to restore power to San Francisco through hydraulics), Koba works against him to stir things up.

While DAWN is visually powerful, it lacks the kind of story that made RISE such a provocative film.  The entire plot of DAWN can be summed up as follows:  Caesar tries to keep the peace while Koba lusts for war; the good humans (Jason Clarke's Malcolm and Keri Russell's Ellie) support Caesar, while the bad humans (the aforementioned idiot and Gary Oldman's Dreyfus) prove Koba's point about human nature.  The human characters here are little more than stereotypes.  Malcolm and Ellie care about the environment and their ape cousins, while Dreyfus shouts things like, ""They're animals!"" and gets everyone practicing with automatic weapons.  We never learn much about any of these people, other than what side they're on.

As for the apes, they're more interesting.  Serkis is fabulous as Caesar, an ape troubled by his own experiences with humans - he clearly loved Will Rodman, the human scientist who raised and protected him in RISE, and Koba is right when he says that Caesar's feelings make it difficult for him to accept the truth about human nature.  But there's very little actual dialogue among the apes - most of them speak only through sign language, with on-screen subtitles.  Only Caesar speaks, and even he uses very few words.  This makes it more difficult to communicate complex ideas, meaning the conflict the film sets up is very basic - Caesar believes it's possible to live in peace with humans; Koba believes it is not.

There's no doubt where this film series is headed - it's called ""Planet of the Apes,"" after all, meaning the apes will be victorious in the final conflict.  I expect the next film (already scheduled for a 2016 release) to give us a version of Armageddon, and Caesar's tribe will finally claim the planet for its own.  But will this new series end where the 1968 classic did, two thousand years in the future, with Charleton Heston's Taylor on that beach staring at the remains of the Statue of Liberty?  That was one of the most powerful film endings I've ever seen, one that impresses me even now, after almost fifty years.  When Heston screamed, ""You maniacs!  You blew it all up!,"" we knew what he was talking about - the human race destroyed itself through senseless war and nuclear weapons.  This new series has a more complicated premise - humans created the intelligent apes in the first place, they also created the virus that decimated humanity, and they will instigate the war that will decide their fate.  But the apes aren't innocent, either.  In DAWN, Koba sets up the initial conflict, and he pushes his people toward a war Caesar is desperate to avoid.  At the end of this film, it's Caesar who must decide how to respond to the coming war, and it's his eyes we see in tight close-up before the final credits.  I found the ending to be the weakest part of the film, since Caesar's ultimate decision makes little sense in terms of his character, but rather feels like the necessary plot device to get us to the next installment.  I loved the 1968 film - I still do.  And I appreciate both RISE and DAWN as compelling films in their own right.  DAWN is a good movie; it just isn't as thought-provoking as either RISE or the 1968 original.  Watch it for Serkis, for the set design, and for Matt Reeves's direction (he will also direct the 2016 film).  And then watch the 1968 film.  That one is a classic for a reason.",1405209600,3,4791,4.66984505363528
5228093,5,B0090SI4BA,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's a sequel that outshines it's predecessor in every way possible. The characters are believable and have clear motivations throughout the film. There is a great sense of tension throughout the film, and as situations between the humans and the apes escalate you can't help but feel like your holding a rubber band that is on the brink of snapping.

The film is at it's best when the focus is on the titular apes. That's not to say that the human scenes are bad; they're actually really great, I just preferred following their struggle, because they were incredibly engaging characters. The real meat of the film is the interaction between humans and apes, and it is because of everyone's motivations for doing what they do making perfect sense.

Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell, give amazing performances as Caesar and Koba, while the artists at Weta did a marvelous job at making their characters look believable. The apes' human counterparts Malcom (Clarke) and Dreyfuss (Oldman), are also given moments to shine.

This film is truly one of 2014's best.",1405123200,4,1142,4.786802030456853
5228094,4,B0090SI4BA,"Although it is never quite as powerful or electrifying as the film promises it will become "" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes "" never forgets the intimate and dramatic focus at the heart of both the apes' and the humans' struggle. It lures you into a world that is consistently engrossing from the opening shot which only becomes all the more I incredibly vivid and jaw dropping as the story propels forward. The C.G.I., unlike most occasions of its use, is seamless and gives the apes more dimension than the human characters themselves. It is not as thoughtful or as full of ideas as ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" but it's still captivating and the pace is confident and even throughout. This film, along with ""Godzilla"" from earlier this Summer,  represents an emphasis on character, drama and story over relentless action (though the few scenes it has of it are remarkably well-made). It's a focus on narrative over hollow style that has crafted two of the best motion pictures this season and a formula I hope Hollywood continues to repeat.",1405123200,2,1046,4.684782608695652
5228095,5,B0090SI4BA,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an amazing spectacle of cinema! Every single thing about this film works to the nth degree!

The story, about survival, family, and a battle between animal vs. man is highly engaging. The actors, particularly Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebbell as Koba, the villain, and Nick Thurston as Caesar's son, Blue Eyes, all done with motion capture, they make their performances so human. The music sweeps you away and brings you into a sci-fi world of incredible scope. The human elements are also grat with Malcolm played by Jason Clarke and the other bad guy played by Gary Oldman add more heart, which I feel the apes already brought, but that's just me!

In a nutshell, I loved this movie more than ""Rise"", which I felt was a good intro to these characters, but this sequel is able to add more depth to the characters and much more. Highly Recommended!",1405123200,2,889,4.584905660377358
5228096,4,B0090SI4BA,"After experiments on chimpanzees infected with the mind-enhancing Simian Flu virus go awry, the chimps escape and the backfiring virus decimates most of the human population. Complete background is available at planetoftheapes.wikia.com: It might be helpful to look over this site before seeing the movie, especially if you're like me and haven't seen the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rise-Of-The-Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B006O5XYWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rise Of The Planet of the Apes</a>. The chimps, along with a minority of gorillas and orangutans, develop a rudimentary civilization of their own, hunting with spears and arrows and riding horse-back. Small contingents of humanity survive, however, and soon a band of apes in the forests near what's left of San Francisco encounters a hold-out of these survivors. There are some attempts to peacefully coexist, but . . .

DAWN of the PLANET of the APES (""DPA"") is fun, enthralling, carefully filmed, and does a nice job of showing the back-story of the earlier ""Planet of the Apes"" films of the '70s. It begins as a thoughtful science fiction drama, gradually becoming more of a fast action-driven thriller. Still, I'm sure a thriller is what most people are after here, and I'm not sure how it could have gone any other way. Even in the violent latter portions, there are some touching moments and interesting turnabouts, with excellent special effects and CGI throughout.

There are all kinds of potential themes and parallels in this film. The juxtaposed dove/hawk power struggles between the competing chimp alpha males--pragmatic and basically peaceful Caesar versus tragic and embittered Koba--and two human alpha males--conciliatory architect Malcolm versus the more bellicose former Chief of Police Dreyfus--do much to support the story. As in the earlier films, some may find the apes a bit over-idealized with all their noble ""Ape not kill ape!"" business. Chimps can be quite vicious and are often cannibalistic, but they're supposed to have evolved beyond that here (even though they obviously haven't completely).  A few more choice minutes toward the beginning on how the ape society develops, particularly on how the orangutans and gorillas, who take a vague cheap seat to the more numerous and practical-minded chimps, are supposed to fit in would have been a plus. There's one gibbon or monkey sentry shown early-on, but s/he's apparently a loner. A more visible female presence among the apes, something that is completely missing for most of the film, is also sorely needed. Yep, a more diverse ape society would have been great, but I guess you can't expect everything. While it can be fun to analyze and dissect DPA, too much of this is likely to ruin a film that's intended mainly as fairly simple entertainment.

All that being said, there's some interesting character development in DPA. Caesar and Koba are particularly fascinating even though the former seems more like a man in a chimp's body than an evolved chimp. Perhaps that's the point: For better or worse, brilliant Caesar was more responsive to the early experiments and became ""more like us."" Still, why oh why does he speak English even when alone with his fellow chimps? Nevertheless, Andy Serkis does a magnificent job with the voice and everything else he was given in portraying Caesar. The costume design is more problematic. The primary chimps, along with the cute babies (actual chimps?) look quite real, but many of their supporters are less-so. While the orangs and gorillas look real enough, they are a bit bigger-than-life. The humans all look amazingly clean and well-groomed considering the conditions under which they've been living. Still, the human acting is generally good, with some fairly memorable performances by Jason Clarke as Malcolm, Keri Russell as his nurse-wife Ellie, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Malcolm's son, Alexander.

For all its kinks, DPA does an admirable job of showing some truly fantastic situations in the most convincing manner possible, and I'm sure anyone who's enjoyed the other ""Planet of the Apes"" films will like this one.",1405123200,3,4163,5.349618320610687
5228097,5,B0090SI4BA,"A few years ago, Rise of the Planet of the Apes surprised many by reviving the respected, but obviously aging franchise.  Its continuation, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, is an astonishing and nearly perfect science-fiction adventure film which will again raise the franchise's credibility and presence in the contemporary pop-culture landscape.  Rise is a very solid film with a few superior components, largely of the motion-capture variety, with many demanding an Oscar nomination for Andy Serkis' head-turning digital performance as the intelligent and rebellious ape Caesar.  This second (or eighth) film, which finds Caesar and his forest ape clan threatened by desperate human survivors barely holding on in a ruined San Francisco,  enhances and further explores what resonated with audiences before and represents an enormous overall improvement.  From the dynamic opening (an almost dialogue-free depiction of the apes' woodland existence, from hunting to the seeds of power-play politics) onward, I found myself riveted.  The action is crisp and exciting, blending summer-movie spectacle with a sense of ferocity and menace.  The human/ape interaction, as well as the portrayal of divergent worldviews within both sides, vibrates with genuine and complex moral severity.  The choices have substance.  The antagonistic characters (both human and ape) operate from a place we can comprehend, even if we do not condone their behavior.  The violence is considered and has quantifiable impact.  On the whole, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes can and should be held up as an example of epic-scale American genre cinema at very close to its most taut and thoughtful.",1405036800,5,1668,5.401544401544402

5228099,5,B0090SI4BA,"In the much anticipated sequel to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" we find a world almost devoid of human life (due to the ravages of the ""Simian Flu""). Heroic Caesar has, in Moses-like fashion, led his kind to the promised land of Muir Woods and established a fledgling community of still-evolving apes (which are mostly chimps and orangutans). Meanwhile, it is revealed that a sizable band of humans survived the plague (back across the bridge in San Francisco) and need power from a hydroelectric generator to sustain what is a bare minimal existence within the confines of a crumbling high-rise. Trouble is, the generator is located in Muir Woods--ape territory. And thus begins the simian struggle for ascendancy to the evolutionary top spot and humanity's last stand to hold on to it.

""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a thoughtful, entertaining sequel in the rebooted series that follows in the vein of the classic 1968 opener. The original had the revolutionary makeup design and novel concept going for it, just like ""Dawn"" has remarkable CGI battleramas and simian characterization in it's corner. But amazingly, the producers also paid great attention to the script, particularly regarding character and plot development.

All of the main characters (whether simian or human) are very well written; and the actors' performances convey every level of emotion, from love to angst to retribution. And to the writer's credit, some of the apes (particularly Caesar's lieutenant Koba) have flaws that make them as loathsome as their human counterparts. This plot evolution, from the wholly sympathetic role of Caesar and company in ""Rise"", allows for the series's signature allegory and allusion to shine through. Caesar finds himself dealing with being an administrator, instead of liberator, for much of the movie. That means fighting to uphold the laws ""against enemies foreign and domestic"" (to borrow from  the human presidential pledge).  Malcolm, Ellie, and Alexander (the heroic human triumvirate) seem to have the toughest battle: Struggling to gather more resources--a sign of rebuilding the infrastructure that once subjugated apes--while trying to build peaceful relations with an ape community that slowly realizes mankind's desperation...and may capitalize upon it at any moment.

Particularly noteworthy are the performances of the movie's villains: Dreyfus (the leader of San Francisco's surviving humans) and ape Koba. Though the designated heaviest of the heavies, Dreyfus is shown mourning the loss of loved ones and willing to allow for negotiations for the use of the hydroelectric generator. But, he also realizes a greater duty to maintain not just electrical power but political power (in a world of growing ape domination). And Koba is justifiably cynical of human intentions (from his mistreatment as a lab test subject in ""Rise""). And his excursions into the city prove him to be somewhat correct. These added layers of sympathy (for what are billed as devils) not only attempt to break  from the typical blockbuster movie villain trope, but build an intelligent plot that questions the motives of man and ape and whether any of them are better or worse than the other.

The movie's negatives are few. There should have been more of a female presence (besides Ellie's);  the gorillas seemed to take a back seat to the more prominently-featured chimps and orangutans; and ""Dawn"" is a bit too localized--that is, there needed to be a more definite view of whether apes were truly on the evolutionary cusp of planetary conquest or just conquest of Northern California (which may come in future episodes).

So while many will be mesmerized by the movie's special effects--the post apocalyptic view of San Francisco alone is worth watching the movie!--Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also delivers a good script and memorable characterizations. Not as memorable as Taylor, Zira, and Dr. Zaius. But ""Dawn"" is easily one of the best movies in the entire series because it achieves the harmonious blend of both action and drama, entertainment and enlightenment that made the series so special over 40 years ago.",1405036800,3,4138,5.182634730538922
5228100,5,B0090SI4BA,"I had very high expectations for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, especially since I'm such a huge fan of the original films, as well as, the reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  So, Comparing Dawn to Rise, I have to say that Rise was better, but Dawn was still an excellent film that had its moments that I'm sure I'll be thinking about for days to come.  The thing that stands out the most is how well Dawn creates a dystopian future that centers around technology fears, and war.  The bottom line is if you're a Planet of the Apes fan of the previous films, then you will enjoy Dawn.  I'll update this review as soon as I hear news about the special features, but for now go see Dawn.

_________________________________________________________________

Coming off the heals of one of the most talked about reboots in 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes comes a movie filled with emotion and heart. With Rupert Wyatt not returning to direct, newcomer Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) takes his chair in delivering what is a cinematic masterpiece. Its years after the ALZ virus had spread killing most of the human population; while Cesar and his army of apes survives in the forest and in hopes of building a future. Peace may not last very long, however, as an altercation takes place between humans and apes that threatens war and a future for all.

As earth lays in ruins from the virus outbreak we see what happens when apes and humans have to depend on their respective species. Returning to play Cesar is Andy Serkis who stands strong with his character as he tries to bring balance to a world that can no longer have trust. When the apes discover live humans after so many years its hard to imagine who is a real threat. Brilliant writing from Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and others helped to incorporate realism into the film that brought conflict amongst the humans and Cesars family.

One of the survivors in Malcolm, played by Jason Clarke, tries to keep the peace between the apes and his colony that even his own people blame the apes for the extinction of man. There lies this underlining truth that humans were responsible for the outbreak; yet the apes having been tested are portrayed as the real enemy. The apes see humans as violent beings who don't know any better as they continue to hunt and kill living things with guns and weapons. All of these dilemmas are balanced so that we can sense the struggles between both sides and can relate to the characters.

There were great moments during the battles; especially during the final act when apes were confronting apes and humans confronting humans. Watching them side by side were complimentary to the themes of the film where loyalty and trust were tested. The Cesar and Koba story was the center piece of the movie as one had faith in humans, while the other carries scars from his past. One cant help but feel for the other as both have reasons that make the other an enemy to oneself.

All around the performances were amazing, while Cesar stole the show. The pacing of the film was perfect as you never felt the movie dragged or was running out of material. True story telling that had a slow build to a climatic ending. There were moments of suspense and shock that when it happens it leaves you wondering what is there left to offer for the survivors and all those forced to co-exist. The opening sequence summed up the events in the first film and then bringing us to the present with Cesar commanding. Minor criticisms at best with most dealing with plot details.

In a turn of events, Matt Reeves delivered an amazing film that stands next to its predecessor; if not better. From dialogue to moral and internal struggles gives Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a rise above the rest. Of a year filled with sequels, Dawn is a contender for the top spot and may be a true test for others to follow.",1405036800,3,3271,4.63103448275862
5228102,4,B0090SI4BA,"By now we all recognize that Hollywood is driven by the big money and bigger spectacle that sequels provide, with narrative need probably way down the totem pole when considering such follow-ups. As we've just endured the third unnecessary Transformers sequel, such things can prove to be a little depressing, and there was some concern that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes could be just another soulless sequel churned out by the system with pumped up CGI and no real heart. But the film, a technical and thematic marvel crafted by Matt Reeves, is not only exciting in the way we all want summer blockbusters to be, it improves on its predecessor in just about every way.

That's not a knock on Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a film that far exceeded expectations largely by giving in to its sci-fi B-movie roots. It worked as a warning to man's selfish meddling in the ways of nature and as a campy action flick about rampaging apes. 'Dawn' is considerably more serious but let's be honest here, this isn't the ""Planet of the Apes and those Pesky Humans' series. We expect things to get a little dark along the way and probably won't turn out so well for our side. Action and violence, of which there are plenty of both, doesn't simply occur for the sake of momentary thrills. Every life-or-death decision is weighed, measured, and has real significance to the future of two opposing species.

Building on the sturdy foundation laid by the prior film, this one moves forward in time ten years after the human population has nearly been eradicated by the Simian Flu. Caesar (Andy Serkis, and let's just say the man deserves an Oscar by now) is no longer the young, genetically evolved ape we saw before. Now he's the leader of a tribe, and more than that he's got a wife (Judy Greer) and young son, Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston), relying on him. Like any leader, Caesar has those who are loyal and some like the badly-scarred Koba (Toby Kebbell), who claim loyalty but have their own motivations. The rules of their society are pretty simple, with the biggest rule scrawled in chalk, ""Ape no kill ape"". Humans haven't been spotted in what remains of San Francisco in years, so when a small pocket of them are encountered and it ends in bloodshed, some of Caesar's followers start sounding the drumbeat for war.

Screenwriters Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver draw obvious but resonant parallels between Caesar and Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a leading voice amongst the humans with his own son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and lover (Keri Russell) to take care of. Unlike some of the others in their group, neither Malcolm or Caesar wants a battle, recognizing that a full scale war could destroy them all. But the humans need power to rebuild civilization, and the only source is on the apes' home turf. Without it, people have essentially reverted back to a primal state and their desperate, battle-ready leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman, in Commissioner Gordon mode) is ready to do anything to change that.

Analogies to race relations or the ongoing conflict in the Middle East are clear but never beaten to death. It's far more concerned with common themes of loyalty, family, and betrayal, all of which are approached with sincerity and intelligence. When Caesar becomes father to a newborn child, we recognize how the stakes have been elevated and why he makes certain choices. Of course, we also know that whatever he decides it will end up with hundreds of digital apes swinging from power lines and firing machine guns from horseback. How would you like to be a normal animal in a world of evolved chimps? That must really suck. Anyway, when monkey mayhem ensues it's quite the computer-generated showcase. Reeves has done some spectacular digital effects work before, most notably in the monster flick Cloverfield. But let's not forget he also directed the superior vampire remake, Let Me In, and 'Dawn' impressively combines pot boiling thrills with moments of sheer horror. Comedy is sparse but there are a few moments of monkey mockery that are worth a laugh. They tend to end with somebody dying but they're funny for a time.

What more is there to say about Andy Serkis' performance capture work at this point? The emotion he's able to wring is truly exceptional, and I've personally come around to thinking we need a special category for honoring what he's so consistently been able to do. One only wishes the humans had more to work with. Clarke makes the most of a character that is basically just meant to play a lesser version of Caesar. Oldman is never given a chance to be the firebrand his character would seem to demand. But as noted before, this is 'Planet of the Apes', and so they get the bulk of the character focus. Where 'Rise' was mostly a movie about humans, we're clearly meant to land on the side of the apes now and it feels a little counter-intuitive at first.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a deeply intelligent, wildly entertaining sequel that proves the summer blockbuster is capable of evolution, too.",1404950400,6,5035,4.742009132420091
