8568465,1,B00BH86BIO,"This disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, which means it costs more than it needs to and it is likely to have quality problems.  The producer of the disc was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :(  This is a shame, because the program is wonderful and easily worth five stars. There are terrific extras in the form of episodes from Chicago Stories and other things.",1487289600,2,388,4.5285714285714285
