540454,5,6303018408,"The marriage between the music of Prince, a great artist and the dance of the Joffrey Ballet. This is something to see and see again and again.
The choreography is very unique, very skilled dancers supported by an exquisite choice of music.",1070496000,3,240,4.738095238095238
540455,5,6303018408,"Specially  ""I wanna melt with U"" where a dazzling ballerina plays an erotic game with two male dancers, flying (literally) with a sophisticated technique of movement and expression.
Joyfull!",1020643200,2,190,5.551724137931035
540456,5,6303018408,"You don't really have to be a ballet or Prince fan to enjoy this show.  I saw it both on PBS and live on stage, and this video is a wonderful souvenir of the show.  It is fun, energetic, a little sexy, and features some outstanding young dancers.  Not much ""traditional"" ballet here, but viewers can easily see how much hard work and discipline goes in to ballet training.  Ballet purists may be a bit put off by this performance, but for the rest of us it a an excellent way to enjoy an art form we wouldn't normally view otherwise.

My only complaint about the recording is the canned applause.  Much of it seem forcibly and awkardly inserted.  The live audience certainly seemed to appreciate and enjoy the show, but it is obvious that the cheers and applause were sweetened for effect.

*******  November 2010 Update:  I gave away my VHS copy many years ago after acquiring the show on laserdisc.  I have since transferred the show to DVD and it looks great!",1017705600,9,962,4.471264367816092
540457,5,6303018408,"I, too, first saw this performance on PBS in the early 90s and was captivated. I was familiar with the songs, and the context, and so was a bit puzzled at first, at the thought of any ballet company trying to dance to Prince's music, who was one of my favorites at the time.
I needn't have been concerned - the choreographers did a marvelous job of capturing the emotional content of many of the numbers and the tongue-in-cheek attitude of some of the lyrics. I'm THRILLED to see it available at last!",1000771200,2,501,4.397849462365591
540458,4,6303018408,"I was blow away when I first saw this performance on PBS. I searched for this video and, after several years, I was told it is available.... The sound quality is good. The opening numbers make it hard to sit still. Some of the choreography needs a little work. One dancer at the begining almost falls. I did notice, at times, some of the enthusiasm of the dancers wanes. The cut ""Willing and Able"" is by far the best on the video and is worth the cost of the tape. Good modern entertainment.",988934400,7,491,4.290322580645161
540459,5,6303018408,"Billboards is one of the hottest, if not ""THE"" hottest ballets ever choreographed.  It is a cross between MTV, and classical ballet.  The music by Prince, the steps by various contemporary choreographers, and the  costumes out of Studio 54.  The steps are jazzy, sassy, flashy, fresh, and  always fierce!  This tape is a must have.",946944000,8,331,4.927272727272728
540460,4,6303018408,"I first saw the Joffrey Ballet perform this ballet 5 years ago, when they still were located in New York.  It had been quite a while when I noticed a copy of the video in my school library (at NC School of the Arts).  So, of  course I picked it up to refresh my memory.  I was totally blown away, once  again.  The choreography is spectacular and flashy, the dancing is  amazing--I'm not a cameraman, I'm a dancer but I thought the recording  itself was a work of art.  If someone truly enjoys a totally fun time and  would like to see a ""ballet for people who hate ballet"" this is  DEFINITELY it!",924048000,11,597,4.1946902654867255
7835434,5,6303018408,"Had  seen this ballet when it was first toured back in the early 90's at Artpark in Lewiston, NY. To re-live the experience via the VCR brought back a lot of great memories of just how special a time it was for dance in America. My only quibble is the ""arty"" camera work and ""fading out"" that the director has put into the mix to make it appear more ""cinematic"". Not really necessary in my view, but that's minor to being able to see the ballet and hear the music again.",1466812800,,470,4.164835164835165
7835435,5,6303018408,"This performance is awesome, one of a kind mixing ballet with rock.  I have had this on tape for over 10 years and I still enjoy watching it.  Please put this on DVD.",1381017600,,166,4.0
7835436,5,6303018408,"My daughter and I saw the show when it came to DC.  We bought the video and my daughter, the dance major, took it to college.  She promptly lost it among her roommates stuff or gave it away.  It took me 10 years to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  It still plays great and for all I know is the copy that was originally lost!",1364860800,,334,3.8676470588235294
7835437,3,6303018408,"I saw this ballet in person and was enraptured.  When I found this video, I had to have it!  Unfortunately, the camera angles are so close that you don't get the full feel of the ballet.  Some of the best parts (if my memory serves me right) were lost in this video because you couldn't see the full stage, which is truly unfortunate.
As far as Prince's music goes, I love it.  And the music used in this ballet suits it well.",1358208000,,426,4.158536585365853
7835438,1,6303018408,"Why oh why must I watch sex on stage? It was not at all fun to watch this ballet and although the technique was gorgoeus and the lifts superb, the explicit sex acts were too much to bear. If this were a movie it would be rated NC-17. What about art makes it suddenly appropriate? The product was excellent, but the ballet...not so much.",1347580800,,336,4.265625
7835439,5,6303018408,"I was glad to have found this!  I searched for years and at one point it was almost $100, which is way to much!! I had forgotten how new video technology was back then.  I just remembered LOVING the performance.  I'd purchased the VHS at the venue but lent to a friend who denies every borrowing it.
Vendor product came in original VHS cover, in almost new condition.  Tape played well.  I can't get over how much technology has improved though!

I would order from this vendor again.  I think package arrived in 2-3 days, way quicker than I expected.",1323734400,,551,4.45
7835440,4,6303018408,Love this Work by the choreographers.  Shipped in a good time and arrived in good condition. Just wish there was a DVD version; now I have to convert the VHS.,1294704000,,158,4.266666666666667
7835441,5,6303018408,"""Billboards"" still makes me proud. We co-produced and co-funded this confection, and presented the premiere at the University of Iowa Hancher Auditorium in 1993, a few years after we premiered the Joffrey's ""Nutcracker,"" which remains a staple of the rep. It was a landmark in the company's history, taking the international dance world by storm and enabling the company to survive severe financial challenges (with major credit to Prince, who contributed the music for free). And you know, it stands up pretty well after all these years. Maybe it's mostly a ""period"" piece now, but it's still fun and sexy and colorful and energetic. The Laura Dean section remains part of the company's rep, and it still makes your hair stand on end. The Joffrey Ballet was the first distinctly ""American"" ballet company, and that is the core of ""Billboards.""",1261353600,5,844,5.035714285714286
7835442,5,6303018408,"If you want to see an amazing and really different ballet this is it! When I first saw this ballet performed on Ovation TV in fall of 2007, I was so impressed that I immediately searched for and bought a copy despite the going price.  Billboards is a sensational series of 4 ballets and is a must for anyone who is seriously considering becoming a professional dancer. The short dance number choreographed to ""Purple Rain"" doesn't appeal to me, but the others are all outstanding. I loaned it to my daughter's dance teacher who had seen Joffrey Ballet perform it live some years before. She says the dancers' expert execution of their steps makes them appear deceptively simple and she insisted that all the senior dancers in her studio watch it,too, to see both the dancers' technique and their artistic expression. These dancers are having FUN doing this ballet and it shows. While some reviewers have complained about some of the sexier aspects of the dancing in several of the pieces, it is important to recall that this is ""Prince"" and his music, so you would expect the choreographers and dancers to express this aspect of the music. By the way, an excellent indicator of the general viewing response is the fact that the price of a USED VHS copy of ""Billboards"" has tripled since I bought my copy this past October. I even contacted Joffrey Ballet and advised them that the public demand for this ballet was incredible and that they should look into releasing it in DVD format. I'd love to buy more copies for my daughter's teacher and her fellow dancers, especially as they are attending Joffrey's summer dance intensive and Joffrey has recently had students dance selections from this ballet as part of the students' final Performance Showcase. Happy viewing!!",1204848000,2,1769,4.819078947368421
7835443,5,6303018408,"Outstanding programing that should definitely be released on DVD!  I am not really a ballet fan and not even a real dance fan, but this thing blew me away.  My VHS is on its last legs and this is something I would love to continue to watch and listen to well into the future...Everyone I have ever shared it with has been mesmerized by the melding of some classic songs from his Purple Baddness and a total visual feast of beautiful people who know how to move...Don't miss this...",1182902400,4,481,4.393258426966292
