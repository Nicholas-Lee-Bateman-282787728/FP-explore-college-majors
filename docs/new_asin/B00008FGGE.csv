Songs performed by Kansas are as follows: Howlin' At The Moon (from Magnum Opus), Paradox, Point Of Know Return, Song For America, The Wall, Hold On, Dust In The Wind, Miracle Out Of Nowhere, Mysteries and Mayhem, Portrait, Carry On Wayward Son, and Down The Road.",1127606400,,516,4.548387096774194
8186093,4,B00008FGGE,"I've been an avid Kansas fan since thier first album. I have followed the band's evolution, both musically and personally through thier line-up changes. I've seen them live 20+ times and have even promoted two of thier shows in Salina Kansas. This tape is both a testament and a disapppointment. It is a testament to the talents and to the perseverance of the individual members. This also features the ""second best"" line-up the band has ever had. I am ever mystified how the band is able to re-orchastrate thier songs to fit the members at the time. I don't think in all the shows I've seen, they've done the same song the same way twice. Most times for the better. But in this version, some of the intracacies of some titles are missing. I love David Ragsdale's talented violin, but I also miss the original style of Robbie Steinart. All in all, the music quality and obvious talent soars. Even Steve Walsh's sometimes tired voice sounds as good as it has in years. They are tight, and this would be a wonderful lesson for young musicians on how to REALLY play your instrument. As for video quality.... well, don't get your hopes too high. And some type of ""fuzzy"" effect is used that distracts from the whole experience. My take? If you have a music library, it is not complete without this addition. It could be better, but it's still damn good.",1123804800,,1349,4.578512396694215
