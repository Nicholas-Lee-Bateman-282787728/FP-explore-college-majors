4891538,5,B005TK23EW,"I was disappointed when this movie showed up from Netflix.  I popped it in not expecting anything, and was completely blown out of the water.  The story centers around a group of friends, and one of them happens to have access to a beach house, who throw AWESOME parties (think the best fraternity party you've ever been to).  The house is being put of for sale, so Eric (who's father owns the house) decides that there needs to be one giant blow out: an orgy!  At first there is some himming and hawing, but eventually everyone is on board.  The comedy throughout this movie is top shelf.  The couple twists thrown in keep the movie from being predictable (thankfully) and the flow makes it so there aren't any dry spots.  Overall, this is probably the best comedy I've seen in a year or so.",1339027200,,792,4.458333333333333
4891539,2,B005TK23EW,"""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" aims for Judd Apatow territory, sweetness leavened with breezy vulgarity, but it mostly just falls flat. For a while it is saved by the low expectations the title engenders: the dialog isn't stupid, the cast all turn in reasonable performances (though only old pro Lin Shaye and Jack Black impersonator Tyler Labine really register), and nothing is as juvenile as it could have been. ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" is aimable, but it doesn't make you laugh, so what's the point? Still, there is something heartening about what is nominally a romantic comedy not punishing its characters for wanting sex. The orgy of the title leads to complications and hurt feelings (otherwise there'd be no movie) but not to a stock conclusion in which everyone learns that sex with anyone other than a True Love who is The One is a character flaw that must result in comeuppance and heartbreak. In this way, this mediocre trifle becomes accidentally subversive.",1336953600,,972,4.932926829268292

4891541,4,B005TK23EW,"Just rented and watched this and I gotta say, I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes to laugh. I love movies that are quotable and this is definitely one of those. It's got boobs, tons of alcohol, sex fetishes, and alot of partying... ooh and even a little girl-on-girl action! Everyone plays their part very well. You won't be disappointed.",1331251200,3,345,4.672131147540983
4891542,5,B005TK23EW,"I was one of the only people who saw this movie in the theater.  I know this because everyone I recommend the film to has never heard of it.  You would think any film with this title would have gotten some attention, but whoever marketed it dropped the ball because it came and went without a peep.  More important than the attention-grabbing title (the cleverness seems to fly over the head of idiots who think it's profane), is the fact that THIS MOVIE ROCKS!  It's funny throughout, reminds me of one of the Apatow movies mixed with The Big Chill and a little Risky Business thrown in for good measure.  I also thought it reminded me of Dazed and Confused (another one of my all-time favorites), and I think this film will also be one people look back on and be amazed at all of the comedic talent it launched.  Jason Sudeikis is great on SNL, but his movies have been hit and miss.  This one hits in a big way, and he carries it with the wise-ass charm of a young Bill Murray.  Tyler Labine steals scene after scene and Nick Kroll (from The League) proves he's more than just funny, he's a great actor.  The women in the film are given equal weight (important for a movie like this), and they deliver.  Lake Bell is perfect as the uptight therapist and Michelle Borth could talk anyone into an orgy.  Lindsay Sloane is adorable as the girl who's more concerned about getting naked in front of her friends than the actual sex, and Will Forte and Lucy Punch are hilarious every second they're on screen.  I actually wish they were in a few more scenes, they're so funny, but that's a small complaint.

Overall, this movie is more than just funny (seriously, funniest movie of 2011 and maybe more) but it's also a GREAT film.  Very real, oddly sweet and in the end more about friendship than sex.  Well, maybe both equally, but it works.  BUY THIS FILM!  You'll become an acolyte like me.",1329782400,14,1889,4.428985507246376
4891543,3,B005TK23EW,"This was a decent movie. I can see why it couldn't pick up more steam, because the concept is so overtly sexual and right there in the title. It's a decently likeable movie, and no one in the cast is super abrasive, but there is no one to really lead the movie to give it interest. And at the end of the day, an orgy with all your high school friends is just NOT a good idea. This movie is kind of like American Pie or Road Trip for the 30-40 set vs a raunchy comedy for the 20 set, a kind of offputting genre considering these people should have probably grown up by now.",1329696000,,572,3.982608695652174

The humor is well written and the characters are well cast. The movie made me wax nostalgic for the classic movie -  ""The Big Chill"". Like 'Chill' it is a story of a group of friends that have accompanied each other on life's journey for quite sometime. They are at different stages of personal development and self awareness. I won't give the plot away but just know that you will laugh and smile a lot throughout the show. There is some nudity and some non-explicit sex scenes, so you may not want to chose it for family movie night with young kids. For adults, however, you will recognize your yourself and your friends in this show.",1329696000,9,1092,5.312138728323699
4891545,4,B005TK23EW,"I purchased because of scenes in Wilmington, NC.  It was hilarious.  A bit raunchy in parts.  The majority of the scenes focus on the dynamic between the group of friends.  Also great if you're one of those people who watches and says ""He was in the movie...""  I'd like to find the rated R version that was shown in theaters to see the difference.

4891546,4,B005TK23EW,"Sure it does have nudity and the obvious sex scenes, but its not as bad as you would think.  It's actually a really funny movie that is more about friendships and relationships than a good old fashioned orgy.",1325030400,11,208,4.473684210526316

A close group of 30 something year old friends who have been friends since high school find out that their party house is being sold they try to come up with one last blowout party. After a few suggestions they decide on the most extreme one yet...an orgy. This is a movie that I think will only do well be word of mouth from the brave people who watch it first. I really loved this movie and laughed the entire way through. I think that the biggest problem this movie has is the title. If it was called The Last Party, or Growing Up or even Friends Forever I think it would have done better because most people are either too offended or uptight to see a movie with this title. I will say there is quite a bit of nudity and sex in this, but nothing outrageous and a little more then ""Hall Pass"" or the ""Change-up"" (which is the same type of comedy this is). Don't be afraid of the title or embarrassed to watch it, this is a very very funny movie. Overall, a very surprisingly sweet and funny comedy that fans of ""Change-Up"" will love. I loved it.

They want to end the summer (and possibly their time at the house since it's on the market) with one small orgy blow-out since they missed the crazy sex train having grown up with the fear of AIDS through the 80s. The final orgy is hysterical - with the inevitable  emotional weirdness corrected by the drama itself and of course, alcohol.  I laughed throughout the movie and felt great about it at the end.

4891573,4,B005TK23EW,"I think it is an okay movie. I just wish they would have kept most of the deleted scenes in the unrated version of the film.

As it is the movie skews more towards sweet/semi romantic (between the friends and the new girlfriend) than straight up gut bustinlgly funny or sexy. If anything I think the rating system really hosed this film because it doesn't really show that much. It is more about what is talked about or implied than straight up nudity or sexual acts. Although, I will say that the mattress store scenes might veer a bit more towards ""gross out"" type of comedy than the film.

I deleted scene that I most think they should have included in full is the one where Sue is telling the new bride to be to give the new groom anal as a reward for marrying her. To me the funny part is that one of the other characters mentions that they are ""in church"".",1440115200,,862,4.25

4891596,4,B005TK23EW,"Roger Ebert panned this movie.  Roger Ebert had some real objections to the whole idea of an orgy, noting that having sex with a group of strangers is dangerous, and having sex with a group of friends is kind of sad.  He had a point. But I find that an unfair critique of the movie. Most of us do not watch war movies because we really believe it is good and fun to kill people.  Like a lot of sex comedies, this one is a good part fantasy.  What if you were to get together with a bunch of your closest friends for an orgy?

I think the movie gives a pretty accurate answer.  All of the characters find the situation awkward to one degree or another.  Most of them need to get talked into it.  One charges in after the messy break-up of a longtime on-again-off-again romance.  A couple of the other characters either have to talk themselves into it, or give in to peer pressure.  And the party gets off to a terrible start as a result of all the built up tension.  I liked the characters, and recognized more than a couple.  I suspect I might react in much the same way in the same situation.  On the other hand, while a dose of liquid courage might be necessary to get things started, if I drank as much as they did, I suspect I would have trouble standing, much less performing.

This is a last blow-out for the characters, and presumably from this, they go on to something else.  I am sure it will come as a surprise to no one that nobody dies.  Whether they all suffer consequences as a result of this last blast is another question, but not the one most of us ask after such a movie.  Did anybody really ask what became of the characters in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or wonder how Tom Cruise's character did when he got into Princeton?

And it's funny.  Immaturely perhaps, but sex jokes tend to be that way, and I personally find humor in the idea of graphic comments made in inappropriate situations.  The cast delivers the lines convincingly and with some flair.  I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected, and I would not be surprised if it becomes a cult classic.  It is not up there with Gone With the Wind, but it is not supposed to be.  It is a fair amount of fun.",1407628800,,2188,4.219277108433735

The gang which is at first reluctant is goaded into it because their generation missed out on the sex because of AIDS. They are ""the lamest generation.""

Meanwhile the house is on the market and Eric has suddenly developed feeling for the realtor (Leslie Bibb) which did nothing for the story.

The humor was hit and miss, but usually near the mark. There were some great scenes such as when the newlyweds are upset they weren't invited to the perv inner circle. I thought the orgy itself was anti-climatic as the writers needed to have a sex scene, but didn't know how to write one without much sex and still be funny.

A me-too sex comedy, slightly above par.

If people learn life lessons from movies, the take away thought is, will I ever find the kind of relationship I really want if I spend all my free time getting drunk and having sex with anybody that will let me?

4891614,1,B005TK23EW,"A young man uses a house owned by his father as his ""haven"" for throwing wild parties.  Unfortunately, the father (played via a cameo of Don Johnson) decides to sell the property.  This causes the dude to think up a grandiose final farewell party.  But.....what to do?  The idea he hatches is bold & brilliant:  throw an orgy with his closest friends!

This COULD have ranked as one of the all time great party movies.  The plot of the film consists of talking his friends into the idea (some of the babes have serious reservations) and then making all due preparations.  The most comical part of the flick is where he scopes out a local swinger hot-spot to learn the ropes.  There aren't any scenes that will leave you rolling, but there are a few that might cause you to chuckle.

The movie builds up to the climactic orgy scene (pun intended).  I mean, an unrated movie called A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ORGY should be saturated with nudity.  Right?  Unfortunately, as I feared, the orgy scene is a G-Rated cop out.  Only one of the actresses on the cover takes her shirt off (and you'd better have your pause button ready!).  If nudity isn't a big deal to you, then by all means pick up this DVD.  However, IF it isn't an issue with you, then why would you watch a movie like this in the 1st place?",1388016000,3,1296,4.382352941176471

4891617,5,B005TK23EW,"This is a great summertime story that not only crosses boundaries that are not normally covered in movies - it also places friends in situations where the level of trust must be elevated in order to not only keep the pending ""o"" from being known, but also to keep what happens at the ""o"" a secret.  The dynamic cast took great steps to let their boundaries drop to make this a very good story that I am happy to own.  There are a lot of life lessons also included in the movie, and I think this is one of the great underrated summer comedies of the 21st century.  Definitely rent it, then once you're satisfied, buy it!",1381190400,3,619,4.273504273504273

4891625,5,B005TK23EW,"""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" is a campy film that follows the summer events of close friends who get together for major parties. At least two of the men spearhead a plan that would involve a wild party during labor day weekend.  The film ended up being slightly different from what I expected, but still good.  The following listing includes some of the actors/actresses included in ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"": Jason Sudekis, Leslie Bibb, Lake Bell,Michelle Borth, Nick Kroll,Angela Sarafyan, Lindsay Sloane, Martin Starr, Lucy Punch, Will Forte, and Don Johnson.",1373241600,,563,5.108695652173913

4891627,3,B005TK23EW,"I found this film really humorous, and thought that the actors did a great job bringing the storyline to life. Just wonder if there are close friends who have ever thought about having sexual affairs with best friends, and the ramifications as to how it would affect their future relationships. Overall this movie is good, and may be something that a couple or really good friends would like watching, to consider spicing up their relationships with one another.",1371340800,,462,4.935897435897436
4891628,5,B005TK23EW,"I think this movie is awesome! I really don't know what else to say... The cast was great. I didn't do any research before watching it. I was really surprised to see some familiar faces in this movie. For example, Nick Kroll(The League), Tyler Labine(Sons of Tucson), Lake Bell(No Strings Attached), Martin Starr(Freaks & Geeks), Leslie Bibb(Talladega Nights) and of course Jason Sudeikis. The rest of the cast was great too, I just didn't want to name-drop anymore. I laughed through most of the movie. It is definitely a must see for a good laugh. There is some nudity... Actually, quite a bit of nudity. So, if you're looking for a movie to watch around kids or people who are uncomfortable with boobs, butts, dongs and a dildo or two, then I suggest saving it for another night/day. Check it out at some point in time for sure!",1369612800,,831,4.621621621621622

There's the leader and the shy one, and of course the weird one and the funny one. This set-up has been beaten to death! If you've seen Super Bad, The Hangover, Take Me Home Tonight, or any number of copycats, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Granted, the idea here is a little more original than most and the movie does do what it was intended to do, make you laugh. The faces are different, the situation is different, but everything else is exactly the same, there's nothing original here. Jason Sudeikis and Lake Bell do a great job of making us laugh, but again it's just your basic drunken idiots out to do something special, with all the pitfalls, and weird s*** that happens in-between. It was funny and a great way to kill a couple hours, but I got an extreme sensation of deja vu throughout this film. Overall, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is good for some cheap laughs, but it's honestly nothing you haven't seen before.",1361491200,,1076,4.467005076142132

This film does contain nudity and sexual scenes but the overall storyline is about friendship and the ever changing relationships between friends. It has it's funny moments, it has it's upsetting moments, I cried twice watching this film. Like Bridesmaids it deals with 30somethings growing up and growing apart, it is a very touching film and doesn't get it's due.

There's no frontal below the waist nudity, what's down there is of course talked about a lot in the dialogue, but other than a couple of breasts, even the most conservative type, would find little opportunity to put their hand over their eyes.  The comedy is though why I wanted to watch this.  Jason Sudeikis has of course been in the lead role in many a great comedy.  I thought the movie started well with the White Trash Bash party, which had a lot of hilarious moments, however once that party ended the movie never got back to this level again.  There aren't any other parties after this one, except the final one which the movie is titled after.  I thought that one was a bit disappointing, they didn't  do much with the just got married couple who felt offended they were left out, there really wasn't many awkward situations or well comedy amongst the main group.

But still overall the film is worth watching once, however it's not likely something you'd watch a second time, unlike other films in the genre such as The Hangover have achieved through you wanting to see scenes again.",1514851200,,1557,4.575539568345324
