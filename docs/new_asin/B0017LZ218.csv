8266622,4,B0017LZ218,"I'm fairly new to the belly dance world & have little to no ab skills.  I was lucky enough to take a class at TribalFest with Aubre & discovered that she's a really good teacher.  So, I figured her DVD would be easy to follow, & it is.  Sometimes it moves a little quickly for me, but I am pretty sure that's because I'm a noob.

It's a Pilates-inspired workout with a lot of Pilates moves & isn't going to teach you a whole lot of non-belly-related belly dance, but if you, like me, can't do a belly roll yet & have trouble with ab isolations period, you'll probably find it helpful.

Also, I don't think this is a style-specific workout. Though a noob, I'm pretty sure anyone in belly dance who wants to focus on any belly dance ab work would find this helpful.",1389052800,2,763,4.23448275862069
8266623,5,B0017LZ218,"This belly dance fitness dvd is outstanding and I wish I had found it sooner.  I highly recommend it for beginners and begginer-intermidiate dancers seeking to increase their core strength.  I have quite a collection of belly dance instructional dvd's and what makes this dvd great is that it is about doing exercises that will strengthen the core muscles you will need during your dance.  The instructor is excellent.  Her voice is clear and the exercises are easy to follow.  The sequence of the exercises is well thought out and the intensity is just right for the beginner.  My only complaint is that the core strenght work out was to short and I wanted more; however the length of belly rolls practice was just right for me.  It will be a while before I can learn to control my belly muscles, particularly while sitting down. Nonetheless, in the very short while I have practice with this dvd I can tell the difference.  My shimmies feel stronger and I think it is because of the buttocks exercises.  This dvd is excellent and while I wish it was longer in a way the length of time is just right for practicing on particularly busy days. Also, this dvd prompt me to look for other dvd's with drills to strengthen the muscles used in this dance and to drill technique (the dvd's I have are about learning beginners moves, shimmy drills and intermediate level combinations) to complement this one and I found Opposition Hips by Leila Namja (she has a website), highly recommend this one as well.  Lastly, if I find another dvd by this instructor I will definitely buy.",1358380800,2,1571,4.6389891696750905
8266624,5,B0017LZ218,This is a great ab workout that improves your bellydance technique.  I'm never bored while watching it.  Aubre is systematic in her teaching going from floor to standing to teach you true ab isolation without unconciously using compensatory muscles to fake bellyrolls.  It is a full body workout.  Thanks Aubre for a quality product.,1347321600,2,333,5.111111111111111
8266625,5,B0017LZ218,"My belly dance teacher suggested we get this dvd to use at home.  It's not just for belly dancers, any one can use as a pilates workout.  I would say it's intermediate.  I was worried it would be too advanced for me but it was fine.  Abure is an excellent teacher, and she enjoys teaching as well.  :O)",1226448000,6,302,4.137931034482759
