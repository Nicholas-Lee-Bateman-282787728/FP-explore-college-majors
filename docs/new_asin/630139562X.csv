330317,5,630139562X,"Only I would know that the actress Laurie Lapinski is also Cheryl Black. In Honeymoon Horror, she is Cheryl Black. The only two movies that I know of that she has acted in.  I love both movies since she is a superb actress.  I wish she would have done more movies, but those were the days of B movie greats. You can't get those kind of movies now a days.  I am the #1 Horror fan.  That's all I watch.. There is never any boredom like all the other movies out there. Laurie Lapinski/Cheryl Black...You rule!.",1260144000,,507,4.25
330318,1,630139562X,"In this dorky slasher hooey, half a dozen students must clean out an old college dormitory before it is demolished. One reviewer must clean out his eyes and ears before they are demolished by this film.
All the stock characters are here: heroine Joanne (Laurie Lipinski), smartass Craig (Stephen Sachs), hunk Brian (David Snow), insecure Patti (Pamela Holland), and red herring suspects Bobby Lee (Dennis Ely) and John Hemmit (Woody Roll).
Debbie (Daphne Zuniga, they all had to start somewhere) and her parents are the first victims of the unseen killer. The killer then plays hide and seek, cat and mouse, etc, with the cast. One by one, they end up missing until the killer's identity is revealed in a stunning moment that will ring through the ages as a pinnacle point in the art of film...or you know whodunnit if you pay mild disinterested attention to the movie.
Obrow and Carpenter even go through the old device of having the killer explain their motives for the spree, as if anyone but the surviving cast member cared.
The one plus I could find was the pretty good gore effects. The killings have a mean quality to them, from Debbie's death by being run over a few times, to the bloody climactic fight. Sex is kept to a minimum, we get to see a topless girlfriend of Bobby Lee's, but that's it. The film cannot even get exploitation elements down correctly. Another plus is that the killing does start almost immediately, as if the film makers were in a rush to grab the audience's attention. Holding the audience's attention should have been a concern.
""The Dorm That Dripped Blood"" is so typical, and so bad, it is no wonder the makers of the ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"" series had such an easy time skewering the genre.",1074643200,8,1731,4.678688524590164
330356,3,630139562X,"I am very liberal when it comes to ""liking"" horror films from the 80's. Firstly, some of them are the finest slasher films ever made, but even the less than oscar-caliber ones have a grisly glee when it comes to getting down to business -- the art of serving up bloody bodies in new and hopefully stomach turning ways.  First of all, this film does NOT take place in a dorm. It may be some weird kind of apartment building, but that's not very easily determined. It is a foreign film, but some of my favorite horror films are foreign, complete with poor dubbing and stilted acting performances (which I often enjoy as part of a bygone charm). This film tries to be a contender, but it fails. There are three gruesome killings, and I can understand why they were cut from the original release. But even with them restored, I found this film to be slow, more poorly acted than I could stomach, and worst of all, badly written. Still, I recommend watching it from an 80's Slasher Film purist perspective.",1367798400,,1001,4.5
330357,5,630139562X,I've seen a lot of slashers especially from the Golden Era. I consider this to be very underrated and one of the forgotten gems. I thought the acting was pretty good. It had great suspense and build. I really liked the ending. This movie stands out in a long line of forgettable slashers. I'd rank it on the level of House on Sorority Row.  That is another one to check out. I was bummed this movie never came to regular dvd as I don't own a blu ray player. I own a lot of slasher movies and this is one I frequently rewatch. Enjoy!,1362355200,3,532,4.115384615384615
330358,5,630139562X,"......to see this film (here under the title DEATH DORM) uncut and in crystal clarity for the first time. I won't throw away my Media VHS tape (it has sentimental value), but this is the only way to really see this film. Oh, and that nihilistic ending!",1359504000,,252,4.382978723404255
330359,3,630139562X,"The Dorm That Dripped Blood is an early eighties slasher movie that has its moments. It's okay, but I swear it brings nothing original to the table whatsoever. It lacks the oomph that carried most of the movies in the Friday the 13th series and the Halloween series. And for my money, even Terror Train is better. Also, the DVD is pretty grainy in a lot of scenes. For slasher completists, only.",1344211200,2,395,4.5
330360,4,630139562X,"This HD transfer seems to have received a whole unholy hell load of flak. I went into it expecting not a whole lot, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised and being reminded once again that I shouldn't listen to the reviews unless they're written by people I really trust to know their stuff (and even then sometimes you gotta see things for yourself to decide). Could this film look better? If the original camera negative (OCN) could be found. This Blu-ray was transferred from a 35mm interpositive (IP)--that is, the 16mm OCN was blown up to a 35mm negative which was then used for the IP. What we get is a source two generations removed from the OCN, with the audio taken from an analog video master, so there are flaws, but to anyone's knowledge these are the best elements for the picture and sound that currently exist. However, it was cleaned up rather well and is a pleasing transfer with healthy, nondistracting grain. (Unless, of course, you're a grain hater--in which case, why are you watching movies shot on film??? The grain MAKES UP the image, and to scrub that away means to eliminate a certain amount of critical picture detail along with it.) Black levels can look a bit light at times, while most times being richly dark and appropriate. Color reproduction is good, and it's nice to have a film in its native 1.66:1 aspect ratio rather than cropping it for 16:9 (1.78:1), or worse, 1.85:1 (which is common practice in a lot of circles and really cramps the headroom and ruins the photography on a lot of releases). I didn't notice any kind of digital artifacting and the like.

The film itself is a fun ride and recommended for any fans of '80s slasher flicks. There are a lot of cliches here that come with the genre, but there are some unique twists and the movie overall is just a whole lot of fun, and one I personally think is acted real well. Naysayers of leading actress Laura Lapinski can take a flying leap because I think she's incredibly gorgeous, a unique beauty. Props to this film for not having buxom bimbo babes and loads of nudity, despite being a slasher (though there is one such gratuitous shot, which I'll admit I loved). It's not quite as smart and artistic as ""The Prowler"", but it's a breath of fresh air amidst the immense slew of cash-in slasher films. For a student film, this is very well made. INCREDIBLY well made, actually.

The film is uncut, too! There's a great reason to buy it. To my knowledge this is the only uncut version of the film in the States, and even if you don't yet have a Blu-ray player, it comes with a DVD plus your future-proof hi-def copy of the film for when you eventually do splurge on the newer equipment. The two interviews with the composer and special effects artist are very informative and entertaining, and the two trailers--one for ""The Dorm That Dripped Blood"" and the other for its retitle, ""Pranks""--are in full HD glory.

Chalk one up to the Blu-ray horror collection. For high definition enthusiasts, this one's sure to please.

An impressive package overall. Highly recommended.",1319328000,12,3071,4.619047619047619
330361,4,630139562X,"Christmas Break has begun at a town university, 4 friends are preparing to tear down an old dorm that hasn't been used for a while. A homicidal maniac is killing them with their pals one by bloody one with anyone he can get his hands on.

Gory and enjoyable 80's slasher flick that co-stars Spaceballs actress Daphne Zuniga, sure there is little much plot in this movie but what sells this one is the cool kill sequences. There's bloody violence from drillings to industrial steaming, the film is a bit slow at times and too much like ""Halloween"" and ""Black Christmas"" at times but the film works nicely for slasher fans.

This Blu-Ray/DVD Combo has alright picture and fair sound despite it's age and the extras include the film presented in it's uncensored director's cut, audio commentary, isolated score, interviews and trailers.",1318636800,2,833,4.859154929577465
330362,5,630139562X,"For many years 'The Dorm That Dripped Blood' aka 'Pranks' was unavailable on DVD, let alone Blu Ray, and it was quite difficult to get one's hands on a decent copy. Thanks to Synapse you can now get not only a legitimate copy of the film, but in an excellent release as well!! The picture and audio are restored substantially, you get a DVD and Blu Ray copy, special features, and great packaging. If you have ever shown interest in this film or are a slasher fan in the slightest, i highly recommend this release.",1314057600,,514,4.421052631578948
330363,5,630139562X,I gotta say that this movie is great. It's in my top 20 horror films of all time. In some ways you can even consider it a Christmas slasher since it does take place during the Christmas holidays. When the movie was released under the title Pranks the movie was actually the cut version. This new version has the original name of the movie plus it is uncut. It is 4 minutes longer and has extended gore scenes. Most notably the spiked baseball bat to the head has the killer using multiple swings to the victim's head and is much cooler and disturbing. The other scene that is improved is the killer drilling the head of a school janitor. It actually shows the drill-kill. It is so awesome to watch. In the cut version the camera would cut away with blood splattering on the mirror and that was all you would see. The transfer of the movie still looks like a VHS rip. But it's not terrible. I love the ending. It is so UnHollywood. And I love seeing Laurie Lapinski shake her money maker when she needs to.,1313625600,3,1005,4.322751322751323
330364,2,630139562X,"If you like slasher movies, you will enjoy this one.  The only problem here is that the quality of the print is so poor that any extra money spent on a Blu-Ray disc is wasted.  If you want to add this movie to your collection, buy the DVD because the Blu-Ray is not going to get you any better quality (certainly not 1080P quality).",1304121600,3,332,4.171875
330365,4,630139562X,"The Dorm that Dripped Blood also known as Pranks is a cookie cutter slasher from the early 80's, 1982 to be exact. It doesn't offer us anything new or special.
It's cheese appeal isn't even that sticky.

That being said I still like this movie because It's a retro Slasher flick and I love retro slashers,I love everything about them,the formula,the cliches. One of the cliches being the last girl standing battling it out with the maniac in a cat and mouse, life and death power struggle,this is a staple in most of the post Halloween slashers and this one is no exception.

The lead actress is probably the most unattractive heroine in Slasher film history..(Laurie Lipinski).. ""forgive me,if you read this""..This Blue Ray/DVD combo is the unrated version so it is quite a bit better than ""Pranks"" which is the same film with a different title,it was released on DVD in 2003.

There are some really good kills in this version ""Which was also titled Death Dorm as well as Pranks"" .It also features scenes that weren't in the original VHS version.

The acting left quite a bit to be desired. It was after all Developed by a group of UCLA students on a ridiculously small budget..I'm sure Daphne Zuniga best known from Melrose Place who also starred in another 80`s slasher 'The Initiation' winces every time  she thinks about her role in this movie.

She only has about 10 minutes of camera time.
If you're a Die hard retro slasher lover pick it up because again it's everything we have come to love and expect from our stalk and slash fests.",1299888000,12,1542,4.6300366300366305
7811704,5,630139562X,I bought this along with a few other 80's Slashers I hadn't seen yet and thought that this would be the most forgettable of lot but after watching them all I'd say it was probably the best. Loved the ending too because you don't see a lot of endings like it from the 80's Slashers.,1497052800,,281,4.127272727272727
7811705,3,630139562X,"This is a fairly well made slasher film! It's not fantastic...but it's not half bad either! It's not a terribly gory film compared to today's blood and gore effects. The acting is pretty good considering...but it's hard to believe that these people are the age that they are portraying...because they appear to be much older. Regardless, this is an okay time killer and for slasher fans, it's a decent entry! I would recommend that you see it before you purchase this item!
This Blu-ray/DVD combo features 2 trailers, 2 interview segments and a director's commentary track.
The presentation is not without it's flaws, but it looks pretty good overall!",1474329600,,651,4.981651376146789
7811706,5,630139562X,"This is a great slasher from the 80s that you can just turn your brain off and watch. I bought it elsewhere, and I've had it for awhile. The replay value is high because it's very non-complicated, just like stuff like THE BURNING or the FRIDAY THE 13th films; however, unlike those films and others similar to that, there's no summer camp or interesting scenery here. In fact, some may think it's even less complicated than those types of films because it never explains why the killer is the way he is. With most of the film taking place indoors at an old, cruddy looking dorm, the film has a very retro feel. The picture quality on the DVD is also grainy and crude looking, so this adds something to the ugly scenery. In the beginning, a man's hand is sliced open with a knife and is then killed off-screen. Soon after this, three other people are killed. What's a little disappointing is that after these murders the films body count begins to slow down with only one other death scene that's worth mentioning, although there's a part when a guy gets sliced, but not killed, near an ugly mutilated corpse. That other death scene involves a drill to the head that was heavily cut in the R-rated print. In terms of nudity, it doesn't deliver because there's only one topless scene. I'm not sure how many modern horror fans will like it because it definitely looks, feels and sounds so retro; I thought it had some nice soundtracks that really fit the film. I didn't have any problem with the acting, and I personally thought the directing was really good. With a low-budget, they just found some ugly locations, directed the film well, and added some good deaths and soundtracks.

The Blu-ray transfer may be a disappointment to some, but I really liked the way it looked. It really captures the way it probably looked when it was in theaters in the 80s. You can see everything clearly, it just looks crude and old. There's a regular DVD included, and the extras are good.",1446681600,,1973,4.55774647887324
7811707,4,630139562X,"Blu-Ray Review: The movie is titled Death Dorm in the movie not The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is no big deal. Also featured is audio commentaries, interviews, isolated soundtrack and so forth. The picture quality is PERFECT for a slasher film. I know you f***s like to cry because you wanna yank yourselves to HD quality but a true 80's slasher fan watches these films in true, crappy picture form. SO SHUT UP!

Movie Review: It's your basic slasher movie about some wacko knocking off these morons in a dorm because of some obsession with a broad and I LOVED IT!! The murders are neat and everything else is stupid fun.
