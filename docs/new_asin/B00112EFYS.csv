8239883,1,B00112EFYS,"This item is most disappointing.  First, the photographs are, at best, unprofessional and boring.  The models are loaded with tattoos and other body disfigurations.  The photographers are amateurs and do not have the essential background knowledge of basic photography.  The basic idea behind these pictures is just simple ""naked girls"" without any artistic or aesthetic considerations.  This DVD should be pulled from the offerings.",1227398400,5,433,5.703125
8239884,4,B00112EFYS,"I have a background in portrait photography, and recently started to get more into nudes. Since I have a good understanding of the basics of photography, I wanted to see if Nude Photo Basics had anything to offer to a slightly more experienced photographer. Like a previous reviewer, I haven't been able to find another DVD that teaches nude photography. It definitely has a very good amount of useful information throughout. The explanations are very straightforward, easy to follow. I'd say on of the most useful parts of the DVD is the section on lighting. They include little 3D models that give you a real good sense of light positioning. There are books out there that cover this topic and maybe have more details and overall more information, but as a basic DVD, there's something to be said for watching the process as it's happening. I recommend it.",1207612800,,858,4.804054054054054
