6465116,5,B00L4K3MLE,"The movie delivers.  This soft reboot is as good if not better than the best of the series (the first).  Wahlberg was right at home amongst all the action.  The family element cemented the human characters and gained my approval.  Only dislike of the movie is the villain buildup, a flaw in most of the Transformers films.  Other than that the increased focus on the Transformers was the one thing I was looking for in this series, as the past 3 movies had focused on the humans.  Easy to enjoy, as long as you don't nitpick, which others love to do.  Hoping for a Fifth!",1403913600,7,571,4.380952380952381
6465117,1,B00L4K3MLE,"The fourth live-action Transformers film is, I am a bit sad to say, just another bad Transformers film.  Utilizing the same continuity while focusing on new human characters, director Michael Bay squanders the chance to in any significant way renew or revise the franchise.  Mark Wahlberg, busily burning credibility he may have earned with The Fighter and Lone Survivor, stars as an inventor in rural Texas who purchases a decrepit and scorched tractor-trailer which turns out to be a Transformer.  This is an awful project for the Boston-bred actor.  From his voice to his muscles to his macho presence, he is ill at ease portraying an enthusiastic nerd and family man in his early scenes, and he is often downright grating after transitioning to action-hero mode, shouting such juvenile lines as, ""Don't b*tch out on me!  Don't b*tch out on me!""  Quote-unquote drama and protective-dad humor involving him, his teenage daughter (molested, of course, by Bay's camera), and her love interest, a chiseled race-car driver from Ireland, is even more rote and uninteresting than it sounds.  Transformers: Age of Extinction in general honors the series' most dire traditions, from shoehorned-in grade-school humor to explosion-to-explosion storytelling which is at once simplistic and confounding.  Capable performances by Kelsey Grammer (as a brooding, anti-Transformers CIA honcho) and Stanley Tucci (as a capitalist aiming to monetize recovered alien technology) are enticing, and they deliver their expository dialogue with as much flair and/or menace as they can, but even gifted actors can only do so much.

It is amazing how the one-note, punishing aesthetic and tone turns events which should be interesting, such as a wild prologue revealing alien robots caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, into bland motions and noises signifying nothing as they enter and exit the mind.  And at 165 minutes, this film truly is the definition of bloated and indulgent:  it just goes on and on and on and on.  A Chicago-set orgy of combat and destruction plays as an overblown finale, but it is just a second-act diversion before the storyline switches to mainland China and Hong Kong.  Enduring close to three hours of this nonsense is borderline numbing, though, I admit, Bay and his team now and then deliver a moment of interesting production design or high-flying, how-did-they-do-this photography.  Such instances briefly please the senses.  Briefly.  Also modestly amusing is the absurd, but to be expected amount of sumptuous product placement, the flames and debris and crashing robot figures often perfectly framing billboards during the interminable fights.  The products sold range from Beats by Dre to Bud Light to Victoria's Secret to the military of the People's Republic of China.",1403827200,13,2789,5.287981859410431
6465118,4,B00L4K3MLE,"Nine Things about the Movie ""Transformers: Age of Extinction""  [USA, 2014]

1. You can tell a Michael Bay movie from miles away - they have the same visual style, like everything takes place on a clear, windy, late afternoon. His movies are also big, loud, and dumb. Well, this is Bay's biggest, loudest, and dumbest movie yet. But that's OK. You don't go see a Michael Bay film for the story (which is good, because this has the worst script of all the Transformer movies).

2. This fourth Transformer movie is almost three hours long, because it's really two different movies smashed together like cement and steel after a Decepticon attack.

3. The first story is about a Transformer named Lockdown who is hunting Autobots in order to capture Optimus Prime, who, it turns out, is some sort of galactic knight. There's an unfocused religious tone to this film, where Autobots talk about having souls and looking for their Creator.

4. The second story is about how a corporation has discovered a new element, ""Transformium"", which is an unstable metal. The corporation ""mapped its genome"" and can turn it into anything they want...like new Transformers. This is a stupid plotline (any high school chemistry student can tell you that elemental metals don't have genomes) that only serves as a way to bring Megatron back from the dead.

5. The advertising for the movie highlights the Dinobots - kind of like Transformers, except dinosaurs. Yes, the Dinobots are totally badass. Too bad they only show up for about 20 minutes during the final battle.

6. The dialogue of the movie is clunky, and the humor is terribly cheesy. There are plot holes large enough for Optimus Prime to walk through. Speaking of clunky dialogue, it's weird to see Mark Wahlberg spend more time being a protective dad than an action hero.

7. However, the action sequences are probably the best of all the Transformer movies. And let's face it, that's why we go to them. This movie provides ever-increasing spectacle, where bigger and bigger things get destroyed until it becomes almost numbing.

8. I know product placement is a thing, but it got out of hand in this movie. Why would you use Transformium to make Beats speakers or a My Little Pony toy? And when you see a Transformer painted like a package of Oreos, you know a line has been crossed.

9. As Bay himself once famously said, ""I make movies for teenage boys. Oh dear, what a crime."" And that's exactly what this is - a loud, shiny movie with fast cars, giant robots, lots of destruction, and a hot girl. And that's it. If you can tap into your inner teenage boy, you will love this film. If not, then you might want to pick a different movie.",1403827200,6,2684,4.679405520169851
6465119,5,B00L4K3MLE,Mark Wahlberg made this movie the best and Even better.,1403827200,3,55,4.6
6465120,5,B00L4K3MLE,"Everybody are calling theses movies Bayformers since we don't think of Transformers (the REAL ones) when it comes to theses films. Michael Bay has his style for his movies but Im not quite sure that it fits with the real Transformers.

Anyway, this one is the most enjoyable one. FILLED with action and adventure from the beginning to the end! With car chases, jet chases, BIG explosions, robo-shotouts, and robo-fights. The first movie was enjoyable but it didn't had so much action, the second movie had more action but it was so ridiculous, the third movie was just pretty boring, and now we have TONS of action and less silliness with this one. Thank God that now we have a new cast of actors, I never liked the first ones.

Im an action junkie so that's pretty much the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much, I really don't care so much for the story. Now! I still think that there could be a more accurate Transformers film in the future without the ""Bay"" style, but in the meantime Im sticking with theses films until someone does something better. ;)",1403827200,5,1060,4.544502617801047
6465121,4,B00L4K3MLE,"TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION is a extremely enjoyable fun summer movie that surpasses the 2 Transformers movies. Mark Wahlberg is a great addition to the movie as Cade Yeager, a failed single-father inventor struggling to parent his teenage daughter. Unlike Shia LaBeouf in the last 2 Transformers movie where he kinda became useless, Mark Wahlberg actually does stuff to help the Autobots in battle. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee return along with new Autobots such as Drift, Hound, and Crosshairs. Along the with them is the Dinobots.

SPOILER ALERT !!!!!

The Dinobots don't show up until the last 35 minutes of the movie. But they're well handled and they have the best scenes. It's not like Spider-Man 3 where Venom shows up the last 15 minutes of the movie. Or Amazing Spider-Man 2 where the Green Goblin shows up for 5 minutes.

Just like the other Transformers movies, phenomenal visual effects that get better in every entry, and just like Dark of the Moon, this movie has the BEST 3D of 2014 (Definitely see it in IMAX 3D). Don't listen to critics, just go in with a open mind, and you'll have a great time. This is definitely the best Transformers movie since the the first one.",1403827200,5,1190,4.766990291262136
6465122,3,B00L4K3MLE,"Any hope of seeing the Transformers millions of fans grew up watching on Saturday morning long ago dashed, Michael Bay's films are now little more than a licensing expo masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster. The fourth film in the franchise, the aptly named Transformers: Age of Extinction is a thundering assault on the aural and visual senses and a marketing agent's wet dream of product placement overload. In other words: same energon, different chassis, right? In terms of sheer brazen spectacle Bay delivers maximum action; big and loud as ever but also lacking the passion he usually brings to every single project.

It wasn't that long ago Bay had planned for Dark of the Moon to be his final time chronicling the ongoing war between the heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons, but a last-second deal with the studio got him back for at least one more. And part of that deal was he would get to direct his passion project, the crime comedy Pain & Gain, before jumping into 'Age of Extinction'. That bit of arm twisting may have done something to Bay enthusiasm, or at least it feels that way. The result is a film that sees Bay burning through his usual bag of tricks at an accelerated pace and employing a visual style best described as uninspired. Surely, a Transformers movie that doesn't look all that good would be an utter disaster, right? Well, not exactly, because Bay and franchise scribe Ehren Kruger have come up with a story that is surprisingly effective, easy to follow, and tailor made for new star Mark Wahlberg. That's right, no more of Shia LaBeouf's stuttering and getting pushed around by Megan Fox, this film has a genuine tough guy in Wahlberg and it's a drastic improvement.

Not quite a reboot but forging a new path forward, the story takes place a few years after Chicago was devastated in the prior movie. The city has been rebuilt remarkably well, almost as if nothing happened at all. In fact it looks exactly same. In the time since, the world has cooled on the idea of giant killer robots hanging around, and that includes Optimus Prime and his Autobot. Kelsey Grammer plays Harold Attinger, one of those non-descript government guys who always have some black ops unit doing their own thing behind the President's back. He's been out there slaughtering Autobots, including some old favorites, with the help of Lockdown, a mercenary Transformer who desperately wants to find Optimus. In exchange, Attinger will receive a giant Macguffin ""the seed"", a powerful object responsible for the destruction of the dinosaurs and not the ""Big Bang"". Trust that this reworking of history is only there to introduce the fan-favorite Dinobots and not as any part of the story that matters in any way. What's Attinger's deal? Plain old human greed as he's hoping to gain a big payoff by working alongside Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), the temperamental head of KSI Industries who have begun building superior models of Transformer for military use.

Wahlberg, playing the same sort of homegrown lunk/intellectual he played in The Happening, is lowly robotics expert Cade Yeager. His Paris, Texas business has been hit hard by what looks like the worst economic depression ever, and he's basically struggling to make ends meet while keeping track of his hot and rebellious daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz). She's got a thing for bad boys, though, and has secretly been dating a race car driver (Jack Reynor) whose skills come in handy when everything goes to Hell in a hand basket. And it takes a good stretch of time before that happens as we're treated to the Yeagers' financial woes and familial squabbling; even though we know it will be forgotten once Bay starts blowing stuff up. When Cade buys a beat-up old truck at a bargain it turns out to be an in-hiding Optimus, bringing Attinger's goons and Lockdown to his doorstep.

There's never been an excuse for how convoluted the earlier movies have been, especially since...HELLO!!!....this is Transformers and the primary audience is kids. So it's somewhat refreshing to have a story that's fairly simple and straight forward with Optimus looking to protect a humanity that has constantly stabbed him in the back. Does he finally reject humanity and leave them to their fate? He'd be justified to do it, and the dilemma raging within him is probably the most interesting development of the entire series.

But as stated before, nobody comes to these movies for insightful character development. They want to see stuff blowed up real nice, and as stated before Bay just doesn't seem all that into it. Sure, there's more slo-mo and gratuitous flag waving than ever before, not to mention an abundance of glass buildings ready to be shattered, but what else? You can count on two hands the number of times the Transformers do the ""drop and roll"" maneuver and Bay shoots them exactly the same way every time. Same cars getting bowled over, same skyscrapers toppling, it all just gets repetitive and deadening after a while. By the time the action heads to China for the final stretch you've seen it all, ad nauseum. Every critic on the planet is going to talk about the 165 minute runtime so why bother joining in? You know it's too long. I know it's too long. The only one who doesn't know it and doesn't care is Michael Bay. There are a couple of great scenes that really leap off the screen, both car chases set in the middle of falling debris, leaping robots, blasting lasers, and everything else Bay could think of. There's still that difficulty in finding something for the humans to do while the Autobots fight, and for the most part Peltz and Reynor are left to hide in the background, occasionally stopping to make out. Wahlberg wasn't brought in to be on the sidelines and is wisely thrown in the middle of every battle, something they simply couldn't do believably with LaBeouf.

Some curious decisions were made in the choice of Transformers to follow this time, too. While the Dinobots have been demanded by fans since the beginning, they're more monstrous than any previously seen version. Ken Watanabe voices the samurai-esque Autobot, Drift, while John Goodman is the cigar chewing Hound, neither of which you'd call ""first stringers"". Hardly any Decepticons appear at all but the one who does is the only one that really matters, setting the stage for the second chapter in what is to be a brand new full-metal trilogy. Every Transformers movie has been a greater success than the last and even if this one doesn't continue the streak this franchise isn't going anywhere for a long time. That will make a ton of fans very happy but everyone else may want to stock up on Excedrin.",1403740800,7,6670,4.826048951048951

No Shia LaBeouf, John Turturro, Tyrese and others I couldn't imagine how they could continue... But this is called Transformers, not Humans, and as long as Peter Cullen is back adding heart and soul of Optimus Prime than that is all that is really needed.

Set immediately after the events of the Transformers victory against the Decepticons in their war in the city of Chicago, the Transformers are now being hunted by an Anti-Transformer group. Optimus himself finds sanctuary in an old theater and found by a father and daughter played by Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz. They and others come together to discover a dangerous Autobot serving a nefarious group that created them. I have to say Wahlberg is loads more capable a lead than LaBeouf, and Nicola Peltz provides nice eye candy but not as strong a character than the ladies that have come before her. The plot is complex, but not complicated, this movie is the longest of the Transformers movies but its never boring. Plenty of character development, Wahlberg, Tucci and Grammer's characters are played out very well, none better than Peter Cullen's.  Plenty of great new characters as well as some amazing action.

6465178,4,B00L4K3MLE,"I actually enjoyed this movie a lot! The action was almost non-stop! The Autobots, Decepticons, and Dinobots, were all well designed! But my few problems with the movie were: The was still some unneeded humor in the movie. The girl who played Tess (Cade Yeager's daughter) was actually 14-years-old, but she was playing a 17-year-old in the movie... careful there Michael Bay. Again there was a little too much focus on the humans and not enough on the Transformers. The Dinobots were awesome, but they could have used them a little more than they did. Plus the movie jumped from place to place a little too much (from Texas to Chicago to Hong Kong) But in the plus column: The FX were awesome, the action was almost non-stop (as I said before), Mark Wahlberg was an excellent edition to the Transformers universe, plus he was not a whinny teenager like they made Sam into from the last three movies. Hound, Crosshairs, and Drift were awesome, 'new' Autobots. The concept of humans trying to make their own Transformers, but later finding out that they cannot control them was a great plot use. Lockdown was a great villain for the Autobots, although it was clear that Megatron was clearly not gone from the picture, especially since he was made into Galvatron. The battles Optimus Prime had with both Galvatron and Lockdown were epic! My personal favorite part was when the four Autobots: Optimus Prime, Crosshairs, Drift, and Bumblebee were riding on Grimlock, Scorn, Strafe, and Slug (the Dinobots) into battle, while Hound and the main human characters were doing their best to hold his grounds against the dozens of man-made Decepticons lead by Galvatron! Overall: I personally enjoyed this movie a lot more than the last two films... 'Revenge Of The Fallen' and 'Dark Of The Moon' had a whinny teenager as the main character and way too much sexual and potty humor in them, although the battle in Chicago in 'Dark Of The Moon' was epic it really couldn't save the first hour-and-a-half of the movie. Oh, well... I loved this movie, despite a few flaws, but hey, newsflash: No movie is perfect people!

Horrible movie. No character development. Plot holes. Nothing makes sense. I only felt a connection to Bumblebee because of the OTHER movies. Lost respect for Optimus because he says he's going to kill a human (I get that it's happened, but he's never sought one out on purpose). All the rest of the bots are just way too stereotypical. Like really, a fat bot with a beard and a cigar? W.t.f?

And what makes it worse, is that Michael Bay sat in a room, watched this, and said ""Yes! THIS is my movie!!"" .... grumble >:-(",1507420800,2,604,4.336283185840708

6465207,4,B00L4K3MLE,"First things first - the film's story and acting gets no praise from me. On that alone, I'd give AGE OF EXTINCTION two stars. That said, Michael Bay knows how to direct action and put a gorgeous picture on screen. Still, that doesn't warrant an additional star, let alone two. The four stars are awarded for an absolutely breathtaking 3D experience and the 360 degree, immersive Dolby Atmos soundtrack. Hands down, this is of the highest reference level for both and regardless of your thoughts on the movie, for the current price of $17 any 3D enthusiast would be foolish not to pick this up. The picture quality is nearly flawless with just the right combination of depth and pop-out effects. In the opening scene, when the cuddly dino raises his head up and toward the viewer, it truly feels like he's coming out of the TV. I can't rave enough about this 3D presentation. And the Atmos sound is exhilarating as you're enveloped in the action with objects rotating around the room from left rear to right rear and seamlessly flowing all the way to the front. Highly recommended on technical merits alone.

My kids got me into this series (did I just say that out loud?). It's a family thing. I like this newest installment better than the last one because Transformers 3 had a bit too much gratuitous T&A for my tweenagers to watch, whereas this one strikes a nice balance between the popular teenage girl and hot teenage boy without flashing an inappropriate amount of skin. Love the inclusion of an older mechanic-engineer-hero Mark Wahlberg, giving this movie someone all ages can relate to.

If you want depth of character, a gripping plot, and award-winning acting, this movie is NOT for you!

6465297,2,B00L4K3MLE,"The fourth and unquestionable the worst one yet. I had hoped seeing that they were replacing the human cast mostly, that this might reboot the series from the all time low story line that the 2nd and 3rd movies had descended to, but I was sorely wrong. The humans in this one are worse. And who's family acts like that anyway? The boyfriend rubs the fact that he's sleeping with his teenage daughter in her father's face??! What a jerk? But the dad doesn't even seem to care that much, while the boyfriend explains so weird law how even though he's over 18, he can still legally sleep with his daughter. The only likable character, they kill at the beginning. Why do so many movies think killing the comic relief is movie gold??? It's like ""Hey this guy really connects with the audience, and is highly entertaining... let's kill him and let's do it early."" But these are the same people that killed any decent plan, since the first movie. I don't know how this series is still going, though I'd love to see a reboot with a great storyline and some real character development. There are so many great Autobots and Decepticons that just get underused or not used at all. Then everyone has been waiting to see Dinobots and they give you like 5 or 10 minutes of screentime at the end??? I love many of the actors in this movie, it's an awful waste of their talents to play in such a dilapidated franchise. I hope the next one with Anthony Hopkins bodes better. This is a train wreck of a movie. I'd love to see a reboot (with a different director, like Christopher Nolan, to give it some grit) and see a prequel trilogy (written all three in advance so the storyline would be smooth and building). And I hate prequels for the most part, but I'd love to see a reboot about the Cybertron the war that developed. They could start in out with most of the movie being peaceful with letting you get to know and love the main players, while the Decepticons slowly rise to power in the background, and unleash war at the end of the first movie, then build from there, letting you get to know more and more of the Transformers, until the final showdown and escape on the Ark at the end of the Trilogy. They could end it, with the ark embedded in the side of a mountain near the Hoover dam I think, like in the original series. Dont' get me wrong about Michael Bay either, he's made some great movies in His life. He's a name I look for, but something has went terribly wrong with his transformers movies.",1491868800,,2492,4.384449244060475

The Kelsey Grammar character is the exact same human bad guy from the previous movie who sides with an alien bountyhunter that is hunting autobots and decepticons. You have to watch the movie to learn more about Megatron... lol... Can't spoil everything... lol...

Mark Wahlberg's father-daughter relationship is the exact same as Bruce Willis from Armageddon with the irresponsible, immature father with a daughter and the classic what happened to the wife story....lol.... You can throw some mimicking Day After Tomorrow in there as well...

I can go on and on about the above, buuuuut to be fair... Technically, there is only so many human stories/relationships that you can tell. Make no doubt about it! I am still criticizing it and calling it lazy movie-making, but the truth of the matter is that we did not watch the movie specifically for character development, complex plot, and multi-layered relationships. We watched this movie for action. Oh, the daughter is the same character as Megan Foxx from the previous movies. Even built like her.

Sooooo... you are still asking... if I was so annoyed with the lazy movie making and to add on... no true single character was included for comic relief... then how did this movie get 4 stars from me? Easy... And here is your spoiler!!!! They included the Dyno-bots in the movie!!!! I got so excited that I was all teary-eyed!!! If you loved the cartoon, how could you not love the Dyno-bots!!! The Dyno-bots! The Dyno-bots are awesome!!!!! And that my friend.... That alone made the movie for me! I can safely watch this movie again and again just to watch the Dyno-bots!!!! lol...

Annnnnd one final thought.... The bountyhunter is badass! I mean just outright awesome and my thought is that they showed not enough of him, but somehow he has to to show up again in later movies. His character is unique and powerful and not demonic like Megatron so it will be interesting to see how they bring him back....

Enjoy!",1481500800,,2277,4.751898734177215

6465435,2,B00L4K3MLE,"This seemed like a so-so effort for a reboot of the franchise. The plot line of the ""hot"" teenage daughter was laughable (especially the 10-15 second camera shot of her backside in her daisy-dukes that was there I guess for the ""hey look I'm the megan fox replacement for the film""; that cracked my wife and I up). Then there was the shia-whaka-do-boof replacement (I guess you'd call him the boyfriend of the teen daughter); oh brother...his characters played down lack of testosterone or any semblance of manhood just made us shake our heads (SPOILER: just wait for the wahlberg seen on the space ship where the boyfriend drops his weapon, cowers, then runs away like a man-child leaving his fellow man to cover his retreat...ugh this Hollywood emasculation of males in film is daunting to watch).

6465585,3,B00L4K3MLE,"Transformers: Age of Extinction delivers on a few fronts, namely great special effects and action, and great musical score.  But it falls flat on a few fronts as well.  The first is introducing obscure Autobots into the film that have never been mentioned or even seen in previous movies.  Another thing I was disappointed in was the portrayal of Optimus Prime in this film made him out to seem more of a whiny brat and less of a leader.  The movie was very vague in saying who the main villain was...I was confused whether it was Lockdown or Galvatron.  The acting was subpar and this was far from Mark Wahlberg's best performance.  The vehicle designs for the Transformers were ""out there"" and didn't feel like they could be ""robots in disguise.""  What I mean by this is that the designs were far from being inconspicuous and just trying to look flashy and cool.  I know this was a decision on Bay's part but not necessarily for the better.  In conclusion, this movie gets a 2 1/2 stars in my book, as it's not a bad movie, but is good for all the special effects and explosions.",1479168000,,1081,4.474489795918367

The autobots were a joy as always but I do think the new twist with a new cast was just what was needed. I even like the part about scientists trying to create their own and of course the military wanted a piece of the action added to the suspense.

 Come to think of it, how much does it cost to make all those effects... Not much compared to what they made. This isn't a new format but atleast have a good story line.

35-40% is just high end graphics battles
20% is that interaction of over protective father and daughter - Very lame and cheesy.
40% - Could have gone to better story line and music score.

Where it fails immensely is the story line and poor development of the characters.  Three hours to stretch the fact that some interstellar bounty hunter is collecting trophies and some human jerks decide to strike a deal with fancy bounty hunter for his ultimate trophy(Optimus prime) and in the process use dead transformer technology to further their own pathetic cause to save humanity(to enslave humanity).

It's a bunch of non-realistic people in the latest cars to resemble electric shavers.  How does Mark Wahlberg's character have time to be a scrapper, inventor, power lifter, and raise a hottie daughter?  And why does he have a sword that shoots?  But it doesn't stop there!!!  Let's get ""Fraiser"" in the storyline, and the Bosch guy that never made it to prime time.  And to top it all off, let's let Coldplay do the soundtrack!!  That'll add grit(extreme sarcasm intended).  How does that make a movie about Transformers?  It's like the CGI crew needed a movie off, or something.

I hear it's continuing with the same lame cast, but I hope the writers can lift the sequel above Age of Extinction; otherwise, please let the franchise die a dignified death. They need to do a prequel with the original cast. Aliens and humans fighting the baddie alien invaders. Shia LeBeouf can be a civilian consultant to NEST,  and Josh Duhmal can be a general who's just ""too damn old for this s***,"" as so many others have played such roles in many other blockbusters.

6466190,2,B00L4K3MLE,"I went in to watching this Transformers with low expectations, having been told it was the worst of the Bay Transformer films. As low as my expectations were, they were not low enough. I think I honestly regret watching this to the end. Early on, the chases and the fights are pretty cool, but by the time the action really gets going, there's already been too much action. It would be unfair to say this has no story. I went in expecting popcorn and fights and blaster fire. But the attempt to frame the overabundant, mind numbing action, with a ludicrous father-daughter relationship story, actually had me grinding my teeth about half way through because I really just wanted them to die. The Autobots are not heroic in this movie. It's not even a journey toward heroism. This is a movie populated by petty, greedy children in different costumes, duking it out because. Just because. No legitimate reason is ever given. We actually never learn who the main villain is in this movie. I know the same amount about them at the end as I did twenty minutes in. Honestly, every time the Autobots talked about killing people or abandoning Earth, I mumbled at the screen, just do it already. And I seriously don't know what the Dinobots were doing in this film. They had about as much story development as the explosions. If this draggy movie were about half the length and deleted the kind of story telling usually relegated to an opening crawl, it might be worth three stars. As it is, I give it one for obnoxious fighting robots and one for too many car chases. And seriously, who felt the need to quote a law about how statutory rape isn't statutory rape under the penal code due to this particular clause in Texas state law? Who thought that was a good idea? I needed the mind numbing amounts of repetitive action just to bleach the explicitly UNDERAGE explicitly SEXUALIZED for adults (but that's ok because of the statute, right?) female victim character out of my consciousness. If you've really enjoyed the other Michael Bay Transformers, yes, this really is the worst of them, like Devastator's wrecking balls, but the whole film. It's barely tolerable as a complete shut your brain off action fest, barely. If you liked actual Transformers cartoons or decent story telling or even good action, your curiosity about this film is not worth enduring 2 hours and 45 minutes.",1473379200,,2376,4.7139423076923075

6466233,2,B00L4K3MLE,"Michael Bay is a genius...to a point.  When it comes to giant robots fighting giant robots, overly sexualized shots of pin-up models, and his infamous rotating camera routine, no one does it better than the Baymeister.  If this were a 2 hour movie on Cybertron with the Autobots and Decepticons the only characters on screen, this movie would be a masterpiece.  Unfortunately this movie takes place on Earth, with people.  And the moment any one of those people open their mouths you can bet there will be some cringe-worthy muck that ensues.  The dialogue was honestly so terrible that I was embarrassed watching it.  It gets even worse when it tries to be funny.  The jokes are just a few bad puns shy of a Scary Movie sequel.
Don't get me wrong.  I understand that this is a movie about giant robots fighting giant robots and that no one involved thinks they're making an Oscar bate movie and I'm not going into any of these movies expecting a stellar acting performance from anyone.  I simply ask that the people making the film put at least a modicum of effort into the human characters so that they at the very least don't detract from the spectacle that we all go to these movies to see... the giant robots fighting giant robots",1472860800,,1235,4.577272727272727

The story line was pretty basic, and it just kept going! Episode after episode of mayhem and recovery, and the end leaves us hanging, but I really didn't care that much. A good story would have made me hungry for more, but I know exactly how the next one will go. Finally, the physics were blatantly terrible. Everyone should have died, but I think their tops are made out of rubber and their bottoms are made out of springs. Somebody say ""T-I-double G-er.""

Cranked this one out way to fast. Even the cartoons had better writing and plot control. The Cgi is amazing and the ideas behind the camera angles are well done. The evolution of the transformers from the first three films was also underplayed, could have done more back story on the transformers plight with humans , and extended this movie into a couple of movies instead of throwing us into a seemingly rushed hero-story with no real heart ties the characters. If they would have made the Wahlberg character more of a true peer instead of some incredi-dad, things might have gone a different route for the reception of this film.

6466413,1,B00L4K3MLE,"This movie is like a film made based on following three or four five-year-olds playing with toys- BOOM!  BLAM!  I shot him!  He blew up!  BOOM!  But now he is ok again! ok!  Now the transformers are driving on the bridge!  Now its day time and there is a spaceship!  Now its night time!  My robot hit your robot and it exploded!  BAM!  But let's say he missed and he hit the building!  Cool!  BOOM!  Now it's day time and the robot is riding on the dinosaur!  ROARRRRR!

For three hours.

That may be going too far.  I suspect that a few five-year-olds of average intelligence and creativity would probably have a much more imaginative and entertaining story than the one contained in this film.

There are some cool scenes and visual story telling.

About 15 minutes worth of the total run time.

Otherwise, the movie is a mess. The""good"" transformers (the autobots) spend most of the movie arguing with each other and telling the humans how awful humans are.  Which is legit, because the humans are pretty awful to the transformers.  Also, the men in the movie are pretty horrible to the women, and so we like them even less.  You are practically rooting for the evil transformers, (the deceptions) who only get a tiny amount of screen time but who just want to wipe everyone out and rule what is left.  Sounds good to me.  More power to 'em.

Worth it if you have it free on Amazon Prime (as I did) and are doing something else while this is on in the background.  Otherwise, yikes.  Avoid.",1471132800,,1493,4.446096654275093

6466419,3,B00L4K3MLE,"Once you realize this, then you can enjoy the outstanding--if a little overwrought--action sequences in a big dumb Michael Bay action flick. It's the 2nd inappropriate casting of the usually charismatic Marky Mark as a sharpshooter from Texas; completely unable to shed his BAAHHHstun accent especially in action scenes. Frasier Crane looks out of place as generic CIA baddie, and some of the voice acting for the robots is surprisingly uneven. However, Stanley Tucci's performance as The Fake Steve Jobs is the best and the only one with anything close to an arc, but even then he's playing it for kicks rather than for an Oscar.

For parents with Amazon Prime, it's a 2.5 hour distraction on a Saturday for boys age 10-15. For everyone else, it's a big dumb action movie.",1471132800,,773,4.856060606060606

6466634,3,B00L4K3MLE,"PROs:
1. It gets interesting at the 2:13:00 mark (because dinosaurs are always a hit).
2. The actors are all spectacularly attractive, including most of the extras
3. There are many scenes of people driving backwards
4.  Chicago gets trashed again.  The bean makes an appearance
5.  That neckbeard guy from ""Mitchell & Webb Look"" has a small part as a brony
6.  This movie gave work for actors and CGI specialists, which is good for the economy, I guess?
7.  It came free with my Amazon Prime and my cat watched it for about ten minutes with intense interest.
8.  Incredibly predictable two-dimensional characters remind me of the old cartoon and feel nostalgic for the old days.
9.  During the first 2 hours and 13 minutes I got a lot of laundry done.
10. In comparison to the exhausting amounts of guns and cool cars, relentless soaring heroic music and eye-numbing special effects, doing my laundry seemed a lot more fun than usual.

I have been a big fan of the series but I don't think this was its highlight. I think they should have put a little bit more thought into this considering how obvious some mistakes were. I honestly hope they don't make one this mistake filed ever again. Maybe one that isn't as creepy either haha. Overall I think some of the good parts helped it being a 2 star rating.

Highlights were the few times Mark Wahlberg delivered a line that you actually felt he put some meaning behind (and I like Mark Wahlberg, but it seemed like his heart wasn't in this at all), and then, of course, John Goodman's voice overs.  I was bored to tears after an hour.  I forced myself to keep watching it.  Hoping it would improve.  It did not.  I finally gave up on it and went to bed 30 minutes prior to the conclusion.  I'd probably feel like I lost two hours of my life that I won't be getting back if I had anything else I felt like doing except wasting time when I watched this.

6467604,1,B00L4K3MLE,"Another terrible Michael Bay adaptation of a great 80s series. The storyline is abysmal and does not follow the original series. Dinobots don't appear until the last 40 minutes of the movie. The acting is horrible especially Mark Wahlberg, the Tara Reid-like daughter, & the Irish boyfriend. The robots don't really transform as in the series but just change from one form to another. Optimus is dark and foreboding rather than humanitarian & optimistic. He even kills humans which is counter to his character entirely. All the special effects are way over the top and the humans involved never get a scratch. The girl literally falls out of bumble bee going high speed and rolls a full block down a road without one bit of road rash. Michael Bay has to be one of the WORST directors of all time. Literally, this film is a steaming pile of rookie.",1466467200,,847,4.691275167785235

MW dialogue is as predictable as ever and he manages to play himself as well as usual.

It was unnecessary to make the movie what it was. The stupid bots the father made were just that. Absolutely dumb. The imagery of his bots were just pathetic. It was so bad that I almost turned it off in disappointment. Now the truck scene caught my interest. I liked that very much. Anyways. Go in with low expectations and you will enjoy the movie.

I love Starship Troopers...my husband thinks I had a closed head injury to even remotely ""like"" that movie. Nonetheless, I could barely stomach this horrid piece of celluloid. The acting was horrific and the story line was all over the place. There was very little cohesion between the first two movies and this one. It was like some greedy toy exec said, ""Hey, let's make a movie so we can sell a bunch of toys""!

The whole premise of the movie, I thought, was these dinosaur transformers which had their only 15 minutes of fame at the end of the movie. Otherwise, just a lot of human backstabbing against the Autobots. It's a huge snorefest. Save your time and watch something...anything else.",1464739200,,857,4.529032258064516

6467965,1,B00L4K3MLE,Wow. Hot mess is an understatement. The movie lacked narrative or consistent pace. Weird singing and random acts of daughter crying or angry daughter pouts at dad haunt this film. They should have just let the robots fight for the bulk of the film. It was three movies crammed into one deluxe disaster. More TJ Miller would have helped. More connection with past films would have helped. How did this make a billion dollars? So many characters that seemed import at and weren't. Rather than leave footage on the cutting room floor they just put it in the movie.,1464652800,,561,4.6767676767676765

Mark Wahlburg did a great job and it's obvious how he's going to be in a few years with his eldest daughter.  The Transformers were good.  I think any time there is a follow up movie that deviates from the original story - somethings lost.

I cannot believe how such a forceful rehash like Episode VII is so much praised by the media while T4 has been widely panned by many a critic and not-so-critic. I think they  just do not like Michael Bay for one reason or another.

Complainig about  storytelling or character development or whatever? Enough. Of course there are some issues with the movie itself but this is a Transformers installment and it just delivers a hell of an entertainment.
Well shot, well directed, well acted, action packed, with a nice cast portraying equally nice characters, nice CGI, nice photography, nice soundtrack, nice sound mixing....

I could only possibly complain about the following:
1. I did feel I was kind of watching the same movie all over again. All 4 movies are not really that different from each other in the end... but, you know, every episode of the original animated series was also basically the same thing.

Miller, Bingbing Li, and James Bachman. The plot was extremely unrealistic, (even for a science fiction film) more specifically how KSI Industries discovered this unstable material that transformers were made of and creating a hybrid transformer called, Galvatron. And this material can fly and its somehow unbeatable and can shape-shift into anything. That's so far fetched that it was too stupid to watch! The style of this movie seemed to appeal towards college beer drinking and football playing airheads. I'll never watch this film again and I don't recommend it to anyone. To me, it was a, ""One time watcher"" just for its eye candy.",1461542400,,782,5.069767441860465

I liked this movies but I feel like it is very similar to all the other Transformer movies. There are a lot of explosions and scenes where the sun blinds you just like all the other movies. There is always a reason for the Autobots to stop trusting the humans and then they always owe their lives to someone so they stick around and fight. This movie goes on for a long time with a few spots where you think you have reached the end and then more happens. Also I don't like that the humans always seem to kill more Decepticons than the Autobots do.

Overall I gave Transformers, Age of Extinction three stars because I liked the movie. The action is intense, and I liked Mark Wahlberg as the main character.",1461283200,,963,4.497142857142857

6468665,5,B00L4K3MLE,"This review is for the movie Transformers: Age of Extinction

After reading many bad reviews on this movie, I feel the need to give my two cents.  Its Transformers, not The Shawshank Redemption.  To me, both movies are great in their own way.  Shawshank has an in depth story, with characters and lines that really make you think and feel.  Transformers is about robots, over the top special effects, and action.

Transformers does not disappoint with a lack of action.  It is constant, and the visual effects are breathtaking.  These are the kinds of movies you watch to forget about real life.  You don't have to think, you don't have to have any deep feelings, and you can just have fun and relax.  When I put on a movie like Transformers, it is because I want to see robots fighting other robots.  This movie delivers just that.

If you like a lot of action and special effects, this is a great option to watch.  If you want a lot of deep thinking, and an emotional rollercoasters, try The Notebook.",1460764800,,1003,4.5363128491620115

6468772,5,B00L4K3MLE,"You can bash Michael Bay all you want.  I love robots.  I love sci-fi.  I love dinosaurs.  Heck, you put them all in the same flick and, of course, I will love it.  Maybe a bit long but still fun.  I thought Mark Walberg was great.  He does well in any action film.  Needless to say, the female leads tend to be pretty lame in all his movies but this young gal was OK.  Not as good as Megan Fox but certainly better than that no-name we had in the last one.  I didn't miss Shia Lebeouf at all.  Loud, crazy, ridiculous plot, stupid characters throughout, all-time fun.",1459209600,,568,4.166666666666667

Definitely worth watching again.

cons:
Too long.
Some transitions were not well written/executed, e.g. the elevator scene where they literally wait for the bad guys to arrive, I thought that was just stupid.",1458950400,,436,5.140845070422535

It's gives me something to share with my kids from my childhood. Although I love the main characters like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, I wish the story lines had more consistency and I do not appreciate the creators changing the character Megatron to Galvatron. WTF is that?  Anyway, since I am also a fan of Mark Wahlberg and the character he played as a struggling father, it really hit home for me since I'm a mom in the same predicament.

6468956,1,B00L4K3MLE,"If I ever meet Michael Bay, I would like to punch him in the face for destroying my favorite childhood toys.  I do not expect a masterpiece but a fun movie would have been appreciated.  This is a long boring movie (2 hours 45 minutes).  It takes a lot of work to make a movie about transforming robots boring. I hope Stanley Tucci was paid a lot of money because he mails in a sad performance.  They even manage to make the dinobots lame.  The only redeeming quality were the pretty cars.  The rest of it was edited with so many quick cuts you can barely see the robots (in a movie about transforming robots!).  Add the slap you in the face product placement (Bud Light, Victoria Secrets) and the Chinese government propaganda and you will wish you did anything else other than watch this movie.",1457308800,,795,4.404109589041096

Unfortunately, my disk defaults only to 5.1 and more so unfortunately does not engage the rear speakers which virtually all of my 5.1s do!

6469312,2,B00L4K3MLE,"The movie was mostly just fireworks and explosions. Not to mention the product placement was out of control in this movie... Whalberg literally cracks open a Bud Light and drinks it in this guy's face in the movie. The whole 17 year old and the boyfriend storyline with the Romeo and Juliet law could have just been left out of the movie all together. It was essentially wasted screen time filler that could have easily been cut from the movie. Could have easily made her 18 and just cut out all of that useless awkwardness in the movie. Especially the creepy ass comments the boyfriend was making all the time. He would have gotten knocked out if that was my kid and he was talking to me like that. The boyfriend character was completely useless in the movie to begin with and should have just been removed. I would have preferred that they kept TJ Miller in the movie, at least he's funny and can actually act. The movie could not find a plot to stick with and follow at all. First Lockdown is the bad guy, then Megatron is back and he's the bad guy, but he was essentially just there to raise an army to keep the Autobots busy until Lockdown came back apparently. What REALLY pissed me off was the Dinobots. They were in the movie, but only the last 10 minutes of it really. They had no personality, didn't speak, and were seemingly thrown into the movie at the last minute to sell movie posters and make a good trailer. It was a clear ploy to use their presence as a fan favorite to get butts in the seats. Aside from completely changing Transformer storylines again and again, they decide to use Autobots that are all but unknown except to those that read the comics. There is no reason not to be able to use characters from the show that people actually know. There's still dozens of them that they have never even showed in the movies yet. The only reason I gave it two stars was Peter Cullen once again brings me back to my childhood with that soothing nostalgic voice, and Mark Whalberg and TJ Miller were entertaining. If they ever make another movie, they need to made some serious changes in their writing and directing staff. Because right now these movies are just getting worse and worse everytime.",1455321600,,2213,4.466666666666667

6469319,2,B00L4K3MLE,"After I watched it, I saw a review somewhere that said something to the effect of: ""Transformers Age of Extinction is the most successful movie that no one admits to liking."" I agree with that. . . except that it also implies that someone actually likes it. Okay, okay-- I won't judge you at all if you do, and I respect that everyone has different tastes and styles. However, that being said-- I found it to be an extremely cheesy movie that had a lot of potential but ended up pretty much just wasting 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life. But isn't it 2.75 hours long you might ask-- what about that extra 30 minutes? Well, that 30 minutes is what keeps it from being a one star movie in my book. Even though the plot is horrible, the characters aren't well developed, it leaves you with more questions than answers, and some surprisingly abrupt death scenes-- it does have a few cool actions that scenes help to redeem it a little bit. Overall, Mark Wahlberg and his daughter in the film (already forgot her name) are maybe even a little better than the actors from the previous three films. In all honestly, that's not saying much though.
I cannot say that I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're a transformer fan and have already seen the last three you might as well watch it. . . because you're already in too deep.",1455062400,,1335,4.387096774193548

6469372,3,B00L4K3MLE,"Generally enjoyable for what it is; not a ""great movie"", but entertaining for a couple of hours. Fairly remarkable how much computer graphics / special effects can be thrown into a movie these days. I've seen the first Transformers movie a couple of times, but never saw #2 or #3 -- this one, Age of Extinction, is the 4th in the series. Having missed those two, it took me a bit to get the context, with the head of the CIA being evil and ruthless, and a capitalist egomaniac being in league with him until he realizes just how evil the CIA has become. Still not 100% clear about the ""creators"" and their motivation -- seems that not everything back at home for Optimus and his friends is all positive. I guess we'll learn more in the planned next installment in 2017.

I'll watch something like this instead of sitcom episodes on TV, or instead of NCIS or Castle reruns. Happy to see it on Amazon Prime, because it's part of the package. But I would feel a bit dopey if I had spent the money needed to see this in a movie theater. If I have time to kill in front of the TV, this is worth it...once.

One of the worst movies I've been subjected to in a long time. There is something seriously wrong with Michael Bay and the heads of Paramount Pictures. This is supposed to be a kid's movie based on kid's toys. This movie exists to sell kids more toys. Of, course, that should be no surprise to anyone. But why would you try and push the limits of a PG-13 kid's movie?

I saw this movie with my buddy and his 8 yr old son. We even hedged our view experience by going to a brew and view theater. (For a kid, nothing glosses over the talky parts in a movie like an ice cream brownie.)

At the beginning of the movie we are introduced to a wacky, jokey stereotypical side-kick. Ten minutes later this character is incinerated on screen - in slow motion. My friend's son stopped eating.

Much, much later (this movie is way too long for a kid) the heroes are trying to run from the bad robots. They get bottled up in a corridor, stuck behind some elderly asian people. In frustration one of the 'good' guys screams out something like, 'why do old people walk so f**** slow?'. Sure, PG-13 does mean you can drop one 'F-bomb'. But why would you do this in a kid's movie?

Do not waste your time or subject your kids to this movie. If there were a '0' star rating on Amazon, this movie would get it.",1454544000,,1306,4.25

I found the stream was not 4K, but in fact 1080x1920. Slightly disappointed, but not a terribly big deal.

6469743,3,B00L4K3MLE,I love all things transformers. And this movie is no exception. I gave it three stars because it seemed like they tried too hard or not hard enough to impress. Galvatrons story is completely reworked for the film. something I am disapointed in. And the dinobots didn't get anywhere neer enough play. Had that been diffrent i would have accepted their origin story as well but because they didn't get the screen time they deserved. It made the movie almost as dissapointing as the recreation of Devistator in TF2.,1453334400,,512,4.764044943820225
6469744,2,B00L4K3MLE,"I went in expecting to hate this movie, but while I can't classify it as being good, it has its fun moments.  Still, the structure isn't very straight, the product placement is annoying, and Bay still doesn't understand good comedy (just be glad he got rid of that juvenile humor) and most of the movie isn't very interesting.

6469826,2,B00L4K3MLE,"So the latest transformers movie to roll out of Michael Bay's explosion factory is pretty much what you'd expect.
Stuff gets smashed on an epic scale for about 2 1/2 hours.
The tropes come thick and fast and it can be tricky to resist chortling out loud at times.
Product placement is frequent and shameless.
A significant portion of the baddies sport English accents.
Corrupt, overfunded big gubmint agents wreaking havoc in the name of freedom.
Corrupt, overfunded death-squads with expendable incompetent personnel who somehow can't hit the broad side of a barn if their lives depended on it. (and they do)
A billionaire tech-guru dressed like Steve Jobs.
A happy-go-lucky Texan inventor and junk merchant dodging foreclosure on his idyllic farm workshop.
The hot daughter who manages to keep her makeup perfect despite all the explosions and carnage. (She has to remind her scatterbrained dad to eat despite the fact he looks like he's been wolfing down 8 high-protein meals a day and doing resistance training the rest of the time.) She's basically property to be guarded by the males.
The happy-go-lucky boyfriend pursuing his dream of driving a WRC car on public roads - he claims to have his entire life savings in the thing.
A Chinese national manager for the tech firm who appears to be lifted straight out of 'Die Another Day' - she can ride like Pastrana and punch like Lee while dressed as a sleek corporate concubine.
The Autobots themselves are all their own subset of human stereotypes, John Goodman voices the most obnoxious one - what the hell is his beard made of?
There's a samurai autobot for some reason..
Expect a huge amount of swaggering and bully posturing from all the power-characters, good and bad.
The absence of famous cannibal Shia LaBeouf is acceptable.

Overall the craft that's gone into the visual finish is hard to deny - the locations are huge and dynamic and stuff is always flying in every direction.
The shaky, handheld action cam and fast-cutting can get a bit wearisome at times with only the occasional wide shot to remind you who's fighting who and where.

I can't complain though, it's a transformers movie however, I would still rather have watched Shia Labeouf play the main role and that's really saying something...

I might sound like a movie-hippie at this point, but the execution of this movie is seriously worth 2 stars.",1452211200,,579,4.958762886597938

Aside from Bumble Bee's scenes and some loose plot formations giving the autobot characters something to do (aside from the girl, I mean even Megan Fox did more) , I was bored most of the time and actually ""yelled"" at my screen more than once, pondering aloud when this damn thing would end.

6469879,3,B00L4K3MLE,"I wish someone edited this movie down to and hour and a half before I watched it.  It's 2 and a half hours long with 20 minutes devoted to each plot point.  In the beginning, it takes 40 minutes to get interesting.  Most of the human interaction and exposition was pretty grueling to watch.  But then it beats you over the head with the same plot point making even the action scenes full of action drawn out too long and boring.  A lot of it is too confusing or in slow motion.  At some points you're not sure which bots are bad and which ones are good.  They all look similar.

There is a lot of cliche' banter and typical character plots that don't help the story, but I hope that the future Transformers will focus more on the Transformers and not the humans on Earth.  What drives them, their lives on their other world, and why any of them have honor at all.  The actors were excellent, however, there is no distinct hero or villain that I had one defining moment or quote, that makes them memorable... except for maybe Optimus Prime, who says the same things over and over.

The last 30 minutes was excellent.

This movie wins points in the action department when it doesn't go on for too long and the action is tied into a plot device like getting the seed or protecting it.",1450137600,,1281,4.313807531380753

6470019,2,B00L4K3MLE,"Background on me; I'm not a huge fan of sequels because they run a high chance of tampering with the original genius that initially grabbed my attention on the first go around. So naturally, I stay away from sequels. With that said, please know that this review is already biased.

 This time was an exception because it was a free Amazon Prime movie and my 5 year old god son, who was with me at the time, is totally infatuated with all things transformers, so, I saw this as an opportunity to see how the story had evolved since seeing the first film of the series.

After watching I'm still against sequels; allow me to explain:
-The relationship between father and daughter was nauseating for me to watch.
-The ""daddy's little girl"" clichs, bumbling inventor dad hi-jinx, and overly distraught teenage angst was irritating to watch.
-The 20 year old boyfriend was literally good for nothing aside from driving cars and having a strange un-Texan like accent.
-The CIA and corporate corruption was also nauseating.
- Confused loyalty? : Transformers want to protect humans and then they swear against protecting humans, but then they always end up obligating themselves to protecting humans again. I just don't get it?
-Intergalactic robots on crack: There were decepticons, resurrected Megatron through Galvetron, fake transformers controlled by decepticons, and the usual hot rod transformers. Too much metal for me to keep up with.
-Literally 3 hours running time and there still wasn't enough time to flesh out all the plots presented.

In short, wasn't my cup of tea.",1449014400,,1574,4.950757575757576

6470072,1,B00L4K3MLE,"Agree with another post.  This movie could have been accomplished within 60 minutes, not 3 hours.  A F* in a PG-13 rated movie to and one that was bleeped by Bumblebee.  If you can handle the cussing, there is a lot in it.  It is quite sad to see a franchise go down like this.  The cartoons I grew up with, the computer generation over the years did not deserve the Michael Bay intrusion.  Someone else should have produced these movies and made them with more quality.  I have seen the whole series and if there wasn't a reference to S* in all, then it wasn't made.  It is pathetic that the whole series was de-moralized.  I thought the last of the series would have been better, but then... this wasn't the last since Megatron now has a new body in Galvatron.  This opens it up for a filthy fifth movie,  What a drag,  Poor autobots and poor folks who watch these movies.  In todays market I guess autobots would be cursing on TV.  Oh wait.... No they don't.  Prime was the last series and they are still making a version for the younger generation.  SO SAD!!!",1448496000,2,1063,4.319796954314721

Deceptions are a non-issue in this movie so people are the bad guys (and the one alien bounty hunter working for the mysterious ones). This movie is supposed to be building in the world established in the first three movies, but the connections only seem incidental. For good or bad, if you haven't seen the first three, it's not really much of a problem. Old favorites like Prime and Bumblebee are still around, but a new cast has replaced Ratchet and Ironhide. I get it, toys need to be sold, but toys will sell based on solid storytelling. This story is too muddled for an adult mind to really feel for the characters.",1447286400,,772,4.725925925925926

6470283,2,B00L4K3MLE,"Transformers Age of Extinction is not very good but it is not outright terrible either.  I was actually expecting even worse than the film turned out to be.  I grew up with the Transformers cartoon show all through my childhood and still believe that the Cartoon Version from 1986 is far and away the only real Transformers movie I would want my kids to see.

Age of Extinction went back to more of a story element and I give them credit for that much.  At least try to come up with a plot.  Shia Labouf wisely did not sign on for this one.  The lead actor duty goes to Marky Mark Walberg.  Now the choice to cast him by the director was not a very good one.  When you think of a crazy inventory mad scientist actor a guy like Jeff Goldblum comes to mind not Mark Walberg.  Seriously how many inventors and scientists are avid football fans and have huge biceps?  Not saying inventors cant be football fans but just because the movie is based on Texas farm does not mean that he automatically had to be a quarterback on the football team.  I did not buy Mark as an inventor for one second.  He acted so childish to the realtor's who are foreclosing on his property.

His daughter played in the movie by Nicola Peltz is the newest eye candy.  And you would be an idiot father if you allowed you daughter to dress in daisy dukes and tight T-shirts and expect them not to be dating and have boyfriends.  Nicola looked more like a freshman college student at UT, TCU, Baylor etc rather than a high schooler.  It would have made better sense if they would have skipped all the scenes about her chastity/virginity altogether.  If she was an inventors daughter why not portray her as more of a brain with glasses and jeans rather than looking like she works at the local stripclub.  But that is Michael Bay for you over the top in a bad way.  And since when does Suburu or any major rally car sponsor use a high school age driver for professional racing.  You have to throw logic and common sense out the window while watching this movie.

The first live action film was average played as more of a comedy/action movie.  The 2nd film Revenge of the Fallen was an out and out train wreck with no plot except explosions and more explosions.  The 3rd film Dark of the Moon dragged on and on with the same type of thing lots of city destruction but not showing anybody get killed.  Think of the A Team 1000 bullets fired and no one gets shot type of thing.
All of these live action transformers movies are way too long.  They all run close to 3 hours and become monotonous.  Like what does the film editor of these movies get paid to do.  Because they could have easily cut out a half hour and made it a better movie.

I did not think the Lockjaw villain character was to bad why bother with the Galvatron character at all.  All these live action Transformers movies are doing is tarnishing the name, similar to The Terminator franchise and Star Wars franchise running what was once good and pure into the ground for profit.  The film is not all bad the dinobot scenes were pretty neat, but the story takes so long to finally get to them.  The stupidest part of the movie is when they are on the alien ship 1000 feet up and Mark Walberg is worried about his daughters virginity.  How about be worried that you don't fall to your death, just out and out stupid.  I would rate this at about 2 stars mildly entertaining in some parts but way to long.",1447200000,,3436,4.327073552425665

We're talking bizarre monosyllabic lines that make you wonder if some bored screenwriter was actually daring his audience to realize he was insulting them. Add on to that a new psychopathic low for the increasingly bloodthirsty Optimus Prime, a scene dedicated (for the sake of comedy apparently) to explaining how a minor's adult boyfriend is legally allowed to have sex with her, and humiliating paycheck grabs by usually respectable actors like Kelsey Grammer and Stanley Tucci, and the result is a film with all of the creative effort of 'Jack and Jill' with a special effects budget the size of a small country's GDP.

6470573,2,B00L4K3MLE,"Michael Bay is clearly just mailing it in at this point. This movie was boring as hell. From beginning to end, it's filled with cheesy forced sentiment and run of the mill jingoism. The characters were flat and the dialog was terrible. The action scenes didn't even live up to the terrible Michael Bay standards. It was so boring, I stopped watching twice to do something else.
This was a bad experience.
Michael Bay just needs to stop.

I also enjoyed Mark Walberg's wit as he always seems to bring his trademark NorEastern-ness to the screen. That being said, it was enjoyable, but not special. With the usual action and a scrambled mix of intertwined story board, I found myself finding other things to do while watching to keep myself entertained. Fun for the surround sound factor but sorry I paid full price for it a month before it was released on Amazon, but still nice to have in my collection none the less.",1445558400,,623,4.672727272727273
