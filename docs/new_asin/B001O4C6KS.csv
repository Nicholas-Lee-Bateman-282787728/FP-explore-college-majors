I have seen this film many times and find something new in it each time I watch it.  This is due to deft writing ... the dialogue is far superior to most of what Hollywood puts out.  I found the acting to be superb, especially that of Nathaniel Parker as Martin.

I delighted in getting a glimpse of the bucolic side of England.  I was born and raised in U.S. small towns, and I found this depiction of a British small town fascinating.  The film is visually quite a treat.

The story however, is sad.  I find any tale of adultery to be regretful because one party is fooled and betrayed.  And in this case, a family is broken up.  It is a realistic film; these things happen a lot.  One of the lessons conveyed is that many can get hurt from the pleasure of a few.

Sophie Ward as ""Alice"" is beautiful here, and it is enjoyable to see her character have so much fun with ""Clodagh.""  But I do think that their break-up at the end is warranted.  Alice is on a journey to find out who she really is.",1278201600,,1020,4.190721649484536
3726944,4,B001O4C6KS,I found this film to be most interesting - having a lesbian in the family made it far more compelling as I tried even more to understand the writer's story below the surface. I found it well done and feel I understand more deeply what the characters are trying to present - a deep and undying love that is only possible through in-depth meaning.,1245110400,5,345,4.40625
3726945,4,B001O4C6KS,"I found this film a pleasure to experience. Sophie Ward is stunning. She carries the film as she beautifully captures in a subtle, complex, and very compelling performance, the emotional changes her character is going through. I look forward to seeing it again.",1244764800,6,261,5.093023255813954
3726946,5,B001O4C6KS,"I love lesbian romances that aren't too youthful or edgy (or political), and this fits the bill plus I liked the English village setting. The ending was unexpected but probably realistic. I also love LGBT-for-a-straight-mainstream-audience and Christmas romances, so let's see -- the perfect movie:  A New York City-based lesbian Christmas comedy-romance for a mainstream audience! ... is it out there??",1413936000,,403,5.60655737704918
3726947,2,B001O4C6KS,"Based on a 1989 book by romance author Joanna Trollope, this soapy 1995 UK flick follows the lives of pretty Alice Jordan and her boring husband Martin once they move into a quaint little English village with their 3 children. Alice is restless and unhappy... she doesn't paint anymore and blah blah blah I forget what else. She seems lonely in her wealthy and perfect life. This vulnerability leaves her open to a conniving and manipulative LeSbiaN!!! [cue dracula music] who takes the form of a pushy socialite who weasels her way into this godly and good marriage... which must be saved at any cost. All the villagers give Alice pitchfork eyes and burn bridges with her when they find she is a sinful harlot. And the evil lesbian, who is destined to a loveless life of loneliness and unhappiness, is shunned by her family and abandoned in a state of suicidal grief.

Something like that. Ack. Sooooo overdramatically depressing!!!

Some spoilers this paragraph only.  So Clodagh Unwin is the desperate lesbian... I didn't think she had an ounce of chemistry with Alice. She was just an odd character who swoops in and seems to be after Alice's husband. Somehow she charms the kids, gets Martin a job, and gets Alice painting again. And suddenly they're in love and frolicking about having tea and crumpets in their little lesbo fantasy. She expects Alice to just abandon her life... when this doesn't happen, their secret little affair falls apart. Alice realizes her family must come first... and despite feeling Clodagh is the love of her life... she tells her to beat it, basically. Now Clodagh is always coming out of the trees to show up at Alice's house like some sneaky ole snake with forbidden fruit in hand... so when threatening to stalk Alice and commit suicide doesn't seem to work in getting her back... we can assume Clodagh slithers back into the forest to lurk and wait for her next married woman. What else do ye blasphemous lesbians do??

Meh. More like moral preaching here. I can't believe this is only 1995... it's more like 1955. Now the acting isn't terrible. But the most interesting thing about this movie is that the lovely (and very boinkable) actress who plays Alice (Sophie Ward) is an out lesbian in real life (left her husband and came out the year after this movie came out, lol)... and one of her children in the movie is played by a very young Keira Knightley. The rest is poo. Slow and boring.

If you wanna see a better 90s flick with infidelity and lesbians... watch Bound. Or read Denial by Jackie Kennedy. Screw this depressing preachy go back to your husband and shut up B@!!S&!@@....",1402185600,2,2627,4.714596949891067
3726948,4,B001O4C6KS,"I totally enjoyed this dvd. I had no idea of the plot other than what was described on the DVD cover. I was not disappointed as the superb acting, excellent character rolls portrayed by the residents of a small English Village, all reinforced a plot which developed very nicely into an entertaining story. Well Done !",1390694400,,317,4.678571428571429

3726950,4,B001O4C6KS,"Sweet story and the best lesbian seduction scene ever.  However, I was very disappointed at the ending.  It's a wonder they didn't have a tree fall on her (the evil lesbian).  It's my understanding that this film belied the book's ending so that's a bummer. Kerry Fox was great, as always.  And Sophie Ward, well, you go girl!",1360195200,,326,4.568965517241379
3726951,1,B001O4C6KS,"The story is boring and predictable. It is a waste of money. For the major characters, the acting is marginal, the set is OK. The only positive is that the movie will make you glad that you do not live in a village.",1336780800,3,215,4.023255813953488

3726953,1,B001O4C6KS,"This item should have had a pornography rating. This was not the cozy English village mystery that I thought that I had purchased. This DVD is about a homosexual affair between two women, one is a married mother. I will pay more attention and do more research before I purchase any more DVDs as the back of the box did not make this clear. It went in the trash when I figured out what this was!",1309996800,7,394,4.197368421052632
3726954,1,B001O4C6KS,"If you are a soap opera fan, then this may fill the bill.  Throw in a meddling mother-in-law, a token lesbian affair, a flirtatious but bewildered husband and a few kids, and there you have it.  If you find this movie in the $1.00 bin, then it might be worth buying.",1280620800,4,266,4.196078431372549
3726955,3,B001O4C6KS,"Alice (Sophie Ward) and Martin (Nathaniel Parker) have just moved from the big city to their dream house in a quaint village.  Alice finds the adjustment to village life difficult and is depressed and unsatisfied with her mama's boy husband.  Things get even worse when a pushy socialite (Kerry Fox) seems to make a play for Martin, when in fact, she's attracted to someone else.

The story is a good one, but I didn't like any of the actors; they were bland and boring with the exception of Claire Bloom who injects some life into the film, playing Martin's overbearing mother. Sophie Ward's Alice is too colorless and dull to care about and she conjured up no romantic sparks.  Kerry Fox overacts constantly, always making loud, pleading speeches when a whispered one would be better. I didn't like her so the story fell flat.

This BBC movie takes a good look at life in a village where everyone knows everything about everybody - not a good place to carry on a lesbian love affair.  It's an acceptable but lackluster film that could have been better with a stronger cast.",1278979200,4,1075,4.661375661375661

8329317,1,B001O4C6KS,Another piece of trash shoving lesbians down our throat....your married..your married..lesbian or not....you have children....it seems it is okay to destroy every one's life because you have some perverse notion of what love is.....,1461110400,8,232,5.852941176470588
8329318,3,B001O4C6KS,"The central character, Alice, holds the movie together.  She has an essential decency and dignity that carry us over a rather improbable emotional arc, sexual and otherwise.  Alice is unhappy, but not a selfish woman or neglectful mother.  Having an affair, either with her brother-in-law or with the new gal in town, seems a stretch.  And her apparent surprise at the downside of this act -- frowning villagers and traumatized relatives -- is also not quite credible.  No one in the era in which this film was made would have expected much else from a gossipy English village.
The bias against gay sex comes with the decision of her husband, who one imagines would have been more tolerant of a heterosexual affair.  His response to the betrayal comes off as abnormally unglued.  Infidelity is infidelity.  Never nice, never easy to forgive.  But people do manage to forgive, especially a first time offense.
The counterpoint to this bias is the subtext that gay sex is better than the hetero version. This idea is conveyed by juxtaposing two candidates for an affair: one a lounge lizard male, the other an exuberant female.  It seems an easy choice to make, and a relatively more healthy one since the gay affair also restores Alice to a sense of vitality.  But Alice's character, sedate and obedient as it is, is not one to make this choice, at least not so quickly and so freely.  Her decision seems imposed upon her by a too eager writer who has a lesson to teach.
Perhaps the deeper problem, dramatically, is what is supposed to be an ideal marriage.  Although we get many signals that all is not right, we don't ever quite grasp what is wrong.  I didn't read the book, but would have liked more backstory as to what this couple is all about, before things begin to unravel.
These issues aside, the film offers excellent acting, particularly by Sophie Ward and Nathaniel Parker.",1458950400,3,1884,4.7217125382263
