8638040,4,B00I0GYTC6,"If only Captain Manzini and Dave's mother-in-law had gotten married and moved away. Episodes with either of those characters were hit-or-miss. I sumise that at least some 1960s TV viewers turned the channel if Avery Schreiber's character, Manzini, appeared before the opening credits.

That said, My Mother the Car is a great series overall. It is just as good as other fantasy shows of that era (e.g. Mr. Ed, I Dream of Jeannie, My Favorite Martian, Bewitched). Hopefully, the recent loss of Jerry Van Dyke will prompt people to discover or rediscover the series.

The picture resolution is excellent; one almost forgets that the show is 52 years old.

I have yet to discover why Peter Lawford is on the cover. Perhaps it wss a publicity shot, or he appears in an upcoming episode.

A negative aspect of the discs is that they are DVD-R rather than DVD. Unless you watch an episode to the end, the menu key on the remote leads to a DVD-R chapter list with no titles. Amazon has a license to produce My Mother the Car sets on-demand.",1516147200,,1033,4.628415300546448

8638044,5,B00I0GYTC6,Absolutely hilarious series in classic tv shows. Jerry Van Dyke is a real gem in this comedy of his returning mother as a 1928 Porter. I had heard the tv song for this show and thought I'd like to see what it was all about. I couldn't stop laughing even if some of the situations are predictable. I highly recommend this show.,1506211200,,326,4.274193548387097
