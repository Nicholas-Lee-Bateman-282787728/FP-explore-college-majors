7841326,4,6303233767,"This tape contains three cartoons, with a total running time of 69 min.  I would say all of the cartoons had to be from the early to mid 70s???  I seem to rememeber these as the ones I watched as a kid.

One:  The Original X-Men in The Pryde of the X-Men, Can the X-Men, with their newest member, Kitty Pryde trimuph over evil mutant master of magnetism, Magneto and his henchmen The Blob, Pyro and the unstoppalbe Juggernaut?  This one turns out pretty good.  Young kids today can relate, taking quite a few of the charecters that they are used to seeing in the latest X-Men cartoon that was put out as well as the movies.

Two: Spider-Man in Bubble, Bubble, Oil & Trouble.  Will Spider-Man escape the powerful tentacles of Dr. Octopus in time to foil the devious doctor's plan to control the world's oil supply?  This also wasn't so bad, kids will like it.  It's a little goofy, but with so many Spider Man incarnations, it's nice to see how this one compares to all the others.

Three: The Fantastic Four in The Frightful Four.  Have the Fantasic Four met their Match?  It's devide and conquer when teh evil Medusa, Sandman, Wizard and the Trapster join forces to defeat our super foursome.  This is neat for the kids to see also, especially with the new movie coming out, and the complete Fantastic Four DVD cartoon (from the 90's tv show) being released.  Bewarned though, this one does not have The Human Torch in it.  He is replaced by Herbie the robot.  My understanding is that when they did this series, they did not hold the rights to the Human Torch and had to come up with the ""4th"" member.

All in all a good mix to own.  My kids love it.",1120435200,,1652,4.375
