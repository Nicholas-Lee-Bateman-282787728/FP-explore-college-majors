7504674,1,B017GEWCVC,"The shows ""heros"" are so stupid & lame to be heros. They let a mad man go free, takes thier computer equipment & takes controle of quest world. Derp what could go wrong? Through out the show more stuff happens but these idiots seriously forgot the guy they releashed, nope cant be him, the guy we set free in episode ? Nope it couldn't be.  Omg
Really lame episodes
4 of them involving animals
This made me mad. I rather see them in quest world but we see very little of that
Instead they go save a dumb elephat who doesnt need help. A tiger & more. I don't care about animals when they could be cyber surfing
Episodes were they totaly cheat logic
Like how are villian was able to control whales though a vr gear? That wouldnt work
The dog didn't die
And much more stupidity",1459382400,,774,4.22972972972973

7504676,5,B017GEWCVC,"I should probably recuse myself from a review since I worked on this version of the series as a writer and artist....but I thought you'd like some background.

Good News: The Real Adventures series was greenlit in the 90's.
Bad News: The series was assigned to a writer and art director who openly disliked the original, classic series...and had a desire to 'fix it'.

I categorically disagree. The classic early 60's JQ is not only a wonderful show, but, in fact, perhaps the greatest animated adventure show EVER (see my comments on the DVD release of the original for more ""Adventures in Animation"").

But, those Season One guys are entitled to their puzzling opinion.

Anyway, Season One was a disaster on many fronts which I can't get into here and that 'creative' team was booted from the studio half way through production. (this is public, verifiable knowledge) The two previously released 'Season One Real Adventures' speak for themselves better than I ever could about their work. Let's say...I'm NOT a fan....and Original series fans were turned off by the reboot. (your milage may differ). There were some very talented people on that crew, but without a proper leadership, those talents were wasted. IN MY OPINION.

So, enter the Season Two Team, lead by Producers Davis Doi, Larry Houston, Story Editor/Head Writer Glenn Leopold...and humbly, myself as top staff writer and sometimes model designer. It was a bit of a mess to clean up, but we rolled up our sleeves and dove in. Though we were saddled with elements meant to match Season One (Questworld, Maine location, Jessie, etc.), we retooled the character designs and definitely conformed the writing and premise to the classic show. We even recast the voices to get them closer to the Classic. (I confess learning to love the Jessie character as I got to work with her).

This set is a result of that. I stand by this Second Season as only a little compromised by circumstances, and still very entertaining. It is second in JQ quality only to the original show from 1963. I think it would have done a lot better in the ratings if the well weren't poisoned by the Season One shows which turned away many viewers before they had a chance to see these.

Technically, these transfers are decent, so you have the episodes. There are no menus to speak of and no extras (and I would have LOVED to do commentaries on the nine episodes I wrote!). Also, the cover art is Season One style. The shows within look much better than the cover would make you believe. I'm just glad that these good ones can see the light of day and get into your hands.

We tried to keep the VR Questworld stuff to a minimum....often shortening the episode to stick a stand-alone Questworld CGI sequence at the back to keep it out of the body of the episode. Cutting edge at the time, the CGI hasn't aged well, but there isn't much of it.

I look forward to seeing the comments as people purchase this series.

and a PS....let it go about Jessie's pink outfit. We didn't like it either and changed it after a few episodes. Be grateful that the show is on finally on premise and the stories don't suck.....that's more important.",1451347200,51,3164,4.674460431654676
7504677,5,B017GEWCVC,I was excited that they finally released the remaining season/episodes on DVD. I was pleased about the packaging - it is simple and easy to pop the discs in and out. The only hitch is the character issues - they turned Jessie into a complete wimp/wuss/damsel in distress - they even changed her little dark green t-shirt/dress thing into a pink jumper! Ugh. Jonny is a bit more annoying and trying to be a Race Bannon wannabe but other than that - it was a good show.,1450742400,2,467,4.379310344827586
7504678,3,B017GEWCVC,"Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures - The Complete Second Season,"" from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, is an animated version of a series that aired originally in the 1964-1965 season. The animated science fiction adventure TV series aired from August, 1996 to April, 1997 as a continuation of the live-action series and The New Adventures of Jonny Quest (1986). Created and designed by comic book artist Doug Wildey, the series focuses on a boy who accompanies his scientist father on amazing adventures. Inspired by radio serials and comics in the action/adventure genre, it featured more realistic art, characters, and stories than Hanna-Barbers's previous cartoon programs. It was the first of numerous Hanna-Barbera action-based adventure shows, which would include Space Ghost, The Herculoids, and Birdman and the Galaxy Trio.

To save money, the Hanna-Barbera Studio pioneered the technique of limited animation, which does not provide the intricate, smooth animation of classic Disney or Warner Brothers cartoons. Limited animation has the characters move side to side with a sliding background behind them. The characters remain mostly static, with only the crucial moving parts, such as running legs, shifting eyes, or talking mouths, redrawn from frame to frame on a separate layer.

In Season 2, Team Quest spends less time in the sinister cyber environs of Questworld as they jump back to their 60s spy/science fiction/adventure roots. A new voice cast is featured as well as some old faces, like Pasha the peddler, femme fatale Jade, and the deadly Dr. Zin. As Jonny, Hadji Singh, and Jessie Bannon continue to assist Dr. Benton Quest and Race in their global investigations, Team Quest must contend with all sorts of dangerous adversaries, including deadly Zinjas dispatched by the vengeful daughter of Dr. Zin. Meanwhile, Jeremiah Surd is still lurking in the shadows, waiting for the team to let its guard down.

All 26 episodes of the shows second season are contained on 3 DVDs. There are no special features in this unrated set.",1450224000,2,2048,5.237804878048781
7504679,3,B017GEWCVC,"Not Censored like the Original Series Is.  Discs are Burned, Not Pressed.

As most people know, the original Johnny quest series on DVD was censored for political correctness. (Unless you bought them on videotape years earlier.)

Excellent shows, I enjoy them very much.  Johnny is five or six years older than in the original series, he also has a girlfriend!",1447545600,3,360,4.95

7504688,5,B017GEWCVC,I had no idea this set came out as I have the order sets. Once I realized I had an incomplete set ordered it right away! I am a huge fan of Jonny Quest. I went so far to write Cartoon Network etc when I was little since I was adopted and indian. They wrote back which was nice of them to make a childs day back then. I know I wrote them quite a few times back and fourth. I don't really see that with todays cartoons etc,1475539200,,420,3.730337078651685

7504699,5,B017GEWCVC,"This is better than season one.  And it has the complete season in the set instead of breaking it up into two sets like they did with the first season.

It seemed to me they caught more of the feel of the first season (1964) with this second season of the Real Adventures.

[SPOILER] They even had one episode do a comeback of Zin with his 'Robot Spies'.",1464825600,,354,4.176470588235294

8739100,5,B017GEWCVC,"The original series is still the best, given that these reimagined adventures are the best of anything available today.

The animation is lazy, the stories are increasingly ridiculous and the characterizations just don't fit what was started in the first season. I gave it three stars because it's still much, much better than the original series (which was nearly unwatchable for me), but it's sad to see such a sharp drop so quickly.",1502236800,,457,4.3882352941176475

8739107,2,B017GEWCVC,This DVD is not the 2nd Season in continuity from the original 1st Season. It was made during the late 80's / 90's I believe... not the 60's.,1497744000,,141,4.071428571428571
