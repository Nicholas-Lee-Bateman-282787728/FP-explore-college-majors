7512516,1,B017Q8QNHC,"This movie was very inappropriate for my 10 and 8 year old boys.  The language was nothing you'd expect in a PG cartoon movie about going to the moon.  There are numerous parts that are extremely inappropriate for kids - girls in booty shorts, swearing multiple times, the villain of the story killing one of his workers, boy talking about kissing super models, etc.  Completely disappointed.",1459468800,6,392,4.909090909090909

8740005,2,B017Q8QNHC,"The director and publishing house blew it. The quality of the work is great, and the end message of family is wonderful. Its the fowl stuff they allowed that ruins it. Two time they take the name of the Lord in vain, implied murder by bad guy, young kissing, two swear words, and dancing girls... Its clear play or bust. And even then your stuck reminding your children that modesty is for safety, murder is punishable by law, and young kissing leads to trouble.  Could have been the best Fourth of July movie. I am for edited new edition..",1530748800,,540,4.454545454545454

8740013,5,B017Q8QNHC,"This is an awesome family movie from Spain (it's in English) which is probably more patriotic towards Americans, than most American made cartoons.  This one's plot revolves around NASA and a tycoon villain who convinces the world that America never landed on the moon and the video of it happening was a fake. He has built his own rocket and announces he will be the first person to set foot on the moon. Of course NASA (and our main characters who are kids of NASA employees) don't like this one bit.  They plan to get the original rocket out of the museum and send up a new crew which includes one of the kids' father and show the world the original landing site with the American flag. However being they've got to rush they need the elderly now living in a retirement village original NASA employees, one of which is the grandfather of the same kid. So the film has a nice respecting old people as still being useful to society thing going on. They do refer to the grandfather before he is summoned by NASA as acting like an old f (passing wind word), because well frankly that's what's he's acting like, refusing to come out of his room on his birthday and not seeing his grand kids who have made the effort to visit him due to something that happened with his son when both were a lot younger (which you find out later in the film).  There is mild course language like that a few times in the film, but it does fit the context of what is happening on the screen, it isn't mindless swearing like say in the non kids film Sausage Party.  It's how a disappointed and angry at his grandfather kid in his younger teens would speak in real life.  No one swears at a character in the film.  If you watch kid aimed family films from the 80's when I was a kid, such as Goonies, there's swearing in those too.  The government rating of PG on the cover mentions ""mild themes and coarse language"" so it's not like anyone watching this didn't know that going in.

I thought it was quite a fun story.  Obviously it's far fetched like any children's cartoon, there's things like just happening to be child sized space suits on board a rocket you've gotten into which was supposed to carry tall adult astronauts. The launch goes from 12 hours due to sabotage to a minute or something, yet even though they would be going in a different direction due to Earth rotation, they still end up going towards the moon.  There's also a lizard that's rather intelligent that is a pet of one of the kids (who is an inventor and smarter than the NASA staff when they actually listen to him).  There's also a tom boy type girl main character.  Capture the Flag is the type of movie that you know how it's going to turn out before you even begin watching it, but the fun is in getting there.

The younger sister of the alpha boy kind of looked like the little girl from Despicable Me.  The region 4 DVD also has a making of featurette that goes for fifteen minutes.  That one is in Spanish with English subtitles so probably won't interest younger viewers.  The subtitles aren't always that easy to read being sort of camouflaged against the background. But it is somewhat interesting for adult viewers.",1480377600,2,3179,4.417808219178082
