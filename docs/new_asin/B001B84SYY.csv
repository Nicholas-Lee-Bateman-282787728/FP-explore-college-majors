Can't even find a subtitle SRT file online for this film.",1493596800,,71,4.538461538461538
8282186,1,B001B84SYY,"Nothing in the ad indicated that this DVD was not a U.S. release.  Unfortunately when I received it, I found that it was Region 2, PAL, and unplayable on most DVD players in the U.S.  I tried contacting the seller, but I haven't heard back.

BTW, the movie itself is great.  It's what True Lies is based on, True Lies being the movie starring Arnold Schwarzeneger and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Of course in this movie, the agent is French and works for French intelligence.  I like this movie so much that I'll continue looking for one for Region 1, NTSC.",1385683200,6,548,4.43
