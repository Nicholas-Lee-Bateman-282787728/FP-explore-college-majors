2511660,3,B000EADJEU,"This film is a great work of art, and very visually interesting, however, if you must rely on the English subtitle translation, you will be very unhappy with this product.  Each of the three disks seem to have a different translator.

  The second disk is well done, and has only minor typos and tries to get the feel and substance of the conversations.  Usually the subtitles are left long enough for a talented reader to comprehend, but people with  reading difficulties, even minor, may be forced to review and pause.

  The first disk leaves 3 minute blocks of conversation untranslated or flashes substantial subtitles for only 3-5 seconds, requiring the non-Russian speaking viewer to pause and review.  I do not count the songs untranslated or movie titles and inserts from Russian script untranslated, but complete conversations are left with no translation.

  The third disk is between the first and second in quality.  Again one finds substantial untranslated conversations, but at least the storyline is there, in the most part, even thoughthere are more mispellings in these subtitles.  I suspect the translations were made quickly and the translaotrs were of different qualitry, while the project coordinator didn't really care about the subplots, and subtle humor of the work being translated for an English speaking / reading audience.

  The visuals slide easily between grainy greyscale to vibrant color, depending on the mood and setting.  The parody of Soviet life is very accurate, as my ex-Soviet friends attest.  The best possible recommendation is to first read the novel, then view this film.  The best possible fix for the film would be to hire a new translator, or let the person(s) who worked on disk #2 redo disks #1 and #3.

  Shame on the distributor for accepting the substandard translation that burden the acceptance of such a stunning work or art.  I compromise with 3 stars, and hope Woland's cat visits the person who accepted such weak translations.",1171065600,62,1987,5.058641975308642

2511662,5,B000EADJEU,"Although completed in 1940, The Master and Margarita was not published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine Moskva. It was an immediate and enduring success: Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom.

Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts-one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow-the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue-including the vodka-drinking, black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita-exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grostesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.

If you like the book you should see the first movie produced by Russians (producer Vladimir Bortko), simply because there is no other screen version made. It is found a very closed to the book and filmed in Russia. Many of comic and episodic scenes are funny and truly well made. These 480 film minutes are going really easy, especially if you know what is going on there and understand Russian well.

Famous Russian professional actors: Bezrukov, Basilashvili, Lavrov, Abdoolov, Philipenko, Cartsev, Ghaft, Olejnikov, etc., great music by Russian composer Igor Kornelyuk.

It is very interesting to compare it with your own impressions after reading the book.",1164412800,28,1804,5.4784172661870505
2511663,4,B000EADJEU,"""Master i Margarita"", the book and the movie:

I have read ""Master and Margarita"" three times, and I am sure that I will read it again. I was very lucky because all three times I read it in Russian, and even the best translation can not compare to the original. Every time, I found something new in the book; it would turn to me by different facets. ""Master and Margarita"" is incredibly beautiful, deep, sophisticated yet playful and sparkling book with unforgettable characters. In fact, it is not one novel but three. First, about the adventures of Devil and his company in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem of the first century, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita. The story of Master and Margarita is the story of Bulgakov and his wife and muse, Elena. All three stories are connected and intertwine. All three of them end with the exactly same phrase, ""...the cruel fifth procurator of Judea, the equestrian Pontius Pilate.""

So, what is the book about? Good, evil, betrayal, talent, love, forgiveness? Yes, it is. But it is so much more.

I had a lot of doubts before watching the film because as much as I wanted to see ""Master and Margarita"" on the screen I was not sure that it was possible to adapt it and not to lose anything important - which is everything.

I am pleasantly surprised - the film is very good. It is respectful, thoughtful and as close to the spirit of the greatest Russian novel of the last century as possible.

The movie is not perfect (and I don't think that the perfect transfer is possible) but the choice of actors, the music score, the visual palette that change as we enter the different eras, places, and dimensions are outstanding. I was initially surprised by some names but almost every actor proved him/herself very capable in bringing to the screen well known and beloved characters. I would say that some of special effects could be ...well, more special - for example, the mischievous talking cat Behemoth could be done more interestingly. I also don't see the exact reason for creating a new character, the man in uniform with the glasses and very recognizable accent who is in charge of investigating the ""crimes of the band of powerful hypnotists"" - how they call Woland and his entourage. One can argue that the titular couple, the tragic lovers, Master and Margarita are weaker and their story seems pale in the comparison to one of Pilat (bravo to 80 year old stage and screen legend, Kirill Lavrov who can be remembered as Ivan Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov (1969) and Ieshua Ha-Notsri (incredible performance by the young bright star, Sergei Bezrukov of ""Brigada""'s fame almost unrecognizable as Ieshua). I think no one can deny that Oleg Basilashvili as powerful, cynical and eternally wise Woland, the part of Power "" Which wills forever evil Yet does forever good"" IS the true Master of the film. My fascination and admiration belong to Alexander Abdulov on whom I as a young girl had a huge crush in his film debut. For many years he had been the Russian sex symbol but his enormous comical talent found its match in the part of Woland assistant/ translator, Koroviev. His and Behemoth's adventures in Moscow are screamingly funny. I think that the film is a successful and enjoyable adaptation of the beloved cult novel and I recommend seeing it. I am going to order the sound track. As I mentioned, the music by Igor Kornelyuk is one of the film's treasures.

P.S. I used to work on the street where the last home of Mikhail Bulgakov was. He was taken to the cemetery from there.

The famous ""Pashkov's House"" with the rotunda on the top where Woland and his team gathered together before they left Moscow forever, was in walking distance from my work, and I remember, once, I almost got hit by the car -I walked and looked at that music in stone and could not take my eyes off it.",1157673600,102,3967,4.650499286733238

2511667,5,B000EADJEU,"This serialisation is wonderful, just wonderful.  It's true to all layers of the story,  it's sensitive, it brings out almost every nuance in the book,  the actors are absolutely believable, it avoids unnecessary overstatement and so dodges the trap of Hollywood blockbuster whizzbang ""hey lookitt me ain't I cute"" technical emptiness.  It's well-paced: some might see it as slow, but the satire and action/magic/supernatural segments are sparkles, integral sparkles but sparkles nonetheless, on the deep waters of the underlying exploration of  philosophies and the human condition.

And, because of its pacing, when the moments of horror or action appear, they're all the more unexpected, with all the more impact.  The stellar performances (in my order): Woland, Margarita, Koroviev, Bezdomy--who visibly matures through the film--and the paired Pilate and Yeshua. One can watch and listen to Woland--especially in the post-Ball interchange with Margarita--and be struck with pity, and sympathy, and simultaneously a touch of ice to the heart.

Is it perfect?  No, it's not, it can't be, but the use of a miniseries allows full exploration of the book. And the special effects are on the scale of the book, not on what we've come to expect in the post-Star Wars era.  And Behemoth could be a bit better, I suppose.  At least, everyone else complains about him, but I didn't mind.

The actors' voices and general sound are so vital to the feel that I would resist dubbing English over the top.  BUT......oh...the English subtitles...quelle horreur!  Do the Russians so despise the English-speaking world that they would marr a masterpiece in spite? If only someone  had said ""use Michael Glenny's dialogue for the subtitles"". So get familiar with the book, if you're not already (yes, I'm a Michael Glenny translation fan since 1968), then you only need glance at subtitles to know what is being said.

Disk Three just skips right over it.  Had to go to YouTube to view that missing sequence.  It's about 40 minutes long and quite integral to the story.

The only reason I finished watching it was just to finish watching it, so I can just be done with it. Both Master and Margarita were so cold and devoid of emotions that it was hard to picture this amazing powerful towering love that they supposedly feel for each other.  Some of the other characters were actually portrayed very well.  I particularly liked Azazello.  Some people complained about subtitles, but I actually found them to be pretty good.

Of course, expectations being high, the disappointments are inevitable, but they do not overshadow the beauty and the interest of the movie. Maybe Woland and Pilat are a bit too old and stiff for their role, maybe the acting in general is a bit clumsy and inexpressive (or too restrained, static and austere), also the subtitles are a catastrophe, but the overall impression is, notwithstanding, very good.

2511703,5,B000EADJEU,"Mikhail Bulgakov's novel THE MASTER AND MARGARITA is a strange mixture of genres and attitudes. Essentially it is intended as a devastating satire on Soviet communist bureaucracy and corruption, especially in the literary world in which Bulgakov, an anti-communist intellectual, moved between the two world wars. It is also a celebration of the beauty of Woman and of Woman's selfless love of man - this theme being cast into a context of witchcraft and delicious sexual activity. Then again, the novel is also a testament to truth, as opposed to lying; and here the enigmatic figure of the Master is one hero for truth, while Jesus in his novel about the role of Pontius Pilate in the Gospel story is the other - going under the name of Yeshua Ha-Notsri and shown as mortal rather than resurrected.
  This film endeavours for the most part to be utterly faithful to the novel. It is made in 10 episodes of 45 minutes each. Towards the end the director has taken some liberties with the text and become rather oddly mystical. However, overall it is a film of outstanding quality, filled with vividly enacted drama and excelling in its presentation of the erotic parts of the novel.
  In Russia devils and demons are sometimes seen as benefactors of humanity and not as totally evil, as P. D. Ouspensky noted in one of his short novels. This is true of Woland (the Devil) in this story. He and his associates are partly puckish mischief-makers and have the ability and willingness to help those who are not corrupt, notably the Master (a reflection of the author) and Margarita (a reflection of the author's third wife).

2511707,5,B000EADJEU,"""The Master and Margarita"" is a brilliant film adaptation of the book (of the same name) by Mikhail Bulgakov. This (2005) film is directed by Vladimir Bortko, the director who also brought us the 2003 mini-series ""Idiot"" (my favorite Russian movie, adapted from my favorite Russian novel).

I read the Bergin and O'Connor translation of ""The Master and Margarita"" a few months before watching this mini-series. My enjoyment (thrill) in reading the novel was greatly increased by the fact that I had no prior knowledge of anything about it. I was delighted at the mysteries and twists and turns. Therefore, I am very, very disappointed in reviewers here who included ""spoilers"" in their reviews. Don't you people understand (or care) that these reviews are most often used by people who have NOT YET seen the movie? Believe me, you should watch the mini-series (or read the book) without reading any more reviews.

Whenever I read Bulgakov, I am struck by the fact that most other novels are trivial in comparison. His novels (and this film) are very smart, funny, satirical, thoughtful, and moving. I am thrilled that Bortko brought this novel to the screen. Also, I am thrilled that the movie is of sufficient length (eight hours) to tell nearly all of the story. (Hollywood would have packaged this film adaptation into two hours and changed EVERYTHING except the title.)

To those who complain about deviations from the book: Try making a movie yourself sometime (on a limited budget). Bortko did an amazing job bringing this novel to the screen. In future, I will buy any movie he makes. If you have not seen his mini-series ""Idiot,"" you should get it today.

Granted, the English subtitles could be improved. However, this mini-series is so great, I am willing to forgive some minor problems in making it available to the English-speaking market.",1274140800,,1851,4.942122186495177
2511708,4,B000EADJEU,"The series itself is extremely good - I'm surprised that it was possible to transfer such a fantastic (in both senses of the word...) book to the screen.

However, the DVD suffers from a few defects, namely:

- The translation into English for subtitles is at times extermely amateurish, which means that a non-Russian-speaker like myself often has to halt mentally and try to figure out which meaning was intended. This breaks up the narrative.

- The subtitles often appear too late, i.e. are displayed halfway through the sentence or even while the next sentence is spoken. This also breaks up the narrative.

- Only the dialogue is translated, not for example signs. For example, there is a long scene in front of the gate of the writers' club, and the sign is in plain view which implies that the director intends the audience to know where the scene takes place. But if you can't read Russian this doesn't help much...

- Episode names, cast list etc aren't translated either.

- The division of chapters into scenes is done for each DVD as a whole, not by chapter, so the DVD player's display doesn't show ""Chapter 4, scene 3"" or some such, but rather ""Episode 1, Scene 43"". This also means that you cannot see episode length or remaining time.

So: Content 100%, implementation not so great...

The only drawback for English-speaking viewers is the subtitles.  While much of the time adequate, occasionally they drift of into nonsense (even once or twice into cyrillic!). Most likely viewers of this will be familiar with the novel.  If not, they might have difficulty in following the story.  If not for the inadequate subtitling, I would rate this 5 stars.

2511711,5,B000EADJEU,"This is one of the greatest books of all time.  Truly a masterpiece that took Mikhail ""Misha"" 40 years to write and sadly Stalin never let Mr. Bugalkov leave to the West as he so vehemently wanted.

Of course it is highly recommended that you read the book prior to seeing the movie even if you do speak / read Russian, as with any movie based on a book, it really is best to know the foundation from which the director worked.  In this case however, it's as good as a Stephen King movie in that it's so close to the book that it's hard to see any difference.

When I saw that a Russian director had produced this 10-week made for TV mini-series I knew that even if it came with no subtitles I'd still watch and covet it.  I actually have 3 copies of the book itself, but feel my earliest has the best translation - it just feels truer to what Mikhail wanted to say and it flows better in English, but the other 2 are good as backups.

This is DVD set and the books I have are prize possessions in our home video library as well as in our book library.

Since my first introduction to this masterpiece, I read the Master & Margarita regularly every two-three years.
Buying the movie I was very anxious if the movie would bring to the viewer the air and spirit of the times and the spirit of the novel.
Excluding some minor omissions, the 10-episode movie lets the viewer who never had a chance to read this book to understand what is this all about.
There are many great Russian actors perform in the movie. Some of them seem like they were born to perform exactly the role they do.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to introduce themselves to Mikhail Bulgakov. It is worth it!
Additionally, I would recommend to watch another movie based on Bulgakov's ""The Dog's Heart"" novel from the same Director.",1258416000,,974,4.571428571428571

2511714,5,B000EADJEU,"Prior to watching this film, I read all four of the available English translations of the book. I did not notice significant differences in them, which suggests to me that the book does translate well into English. It's nice that viewers who are fluent in Russian enjoy it more, but that should not keep intelligent readers and viewers from reading and seeing it.

That said, I found this film to be true to the book. The casting was excellent; most of the characters appeared much as I had imagined them.

Because the book consists of at least three different complex stories, you will understand the film better if you read the book first.

Apparently the movie was shot to be a television series, and the transfer between segments is difficult;. It is easy to miss key segments of the story. Again, having read the book will help avoid this problem.

As another reviewer points out, the subtitles are atrocious---misspellings and improper usage of words abound.

Portions of various episodes appear on youtube, in case you are interested in previewing them.

All in all, a great book and a great movie.",1254268800,9,1105,4.7894736842105265
2511715,4,B000EADJEU,"First, let me note that I have only seen this mini-series in Russian. English subtitles for Russian movies are often terrible.

I am sure, whoever you are, you will find something to complain about after watching this mini-series. Every one of my friends I talked to did. So, do not expect too much. However making a mini-series based on Bulgakov's ""Master and Margarita"" is ""mission impossible"" of movie making. Taking into acount the complexity of this task, I consider this miniseries extraordinary. And for the same reason I do not expect anyone attempting to improve on it in my lifetime.

So, while people can argue about how good or bad a movie this is, consider that
-- ""Master and Margarita"" is a colossal, one of very-top-most important, mind-blowing, entertaining, gripping, thought provoking, etc etc works of Soviet Literature (much more important than ""Doctor Zhivago"", in my opinion)
-- this adaptation is the best thus far
-- it is not bad
-- it is very unlikely that someone will make another worthy attempt any time soon (I'd give it a couple decades at least)

2511716,4,B000EADJEU,"The Master and Margarita is a dense book, and its combination of fantasy, political polemics and Russian  symbols and mythology are sometimes confusing to the western eye and ear. The film version, in the form of a series of television segments, brings the book to life and explains many of its dark corners. I believe that the film is absolutely true to the book and to Bulgakov's vision. The acting is superb, and the special effects are excellent and not overdone. A Russian friend characterized the book as a ""romance,"" in that the Russian artist (the Master) will be severely tried, but Russian culture (the Master's manuscript) cannot be destroyed, and both survive in the ""eternal home"" gained through Margarita's (mother Russia) Faustian bargain with the Devil. Bulgakov settles numerous scores along the way, with the authorities, the corrupted writer's union, individual artists who have sold out to the stalinist regime (""Pilatism""- Pontius Pilate is a principal character) and unthinking Soviet masses. This is a heavy allegorical burden, but the series can be watched for its entertainment value alone. However, it would be wise to read the book first, or at least to be familiar with the life and times of Mikhail Bulgakov. I can't give it the very top rating, because the TV series is lengthy and drawn out, but every word is a valuable part of the whole.",1248998400,5,1370,4.956521739130435

2511718,5,B000EADJEU,"I loved the novel, and the film, which is a serialized Russian TV production is faithful to the book.  This is a fascinating trip into the Soviet governance as aligorical satire.  It is a real feast for the psyche and the soul.",1243900800,2,227,4.380952380952381
2511719,3,B000EADJEU,"First, let me say that if you have not read Bulgakov's masterpiece at least twice and do not speak or understand Russian, do not bother with this film. The film itself is about the best that could be done given the budget, time frame and available actors (especially females ready to appear nude frequently). The fact that the film is serialized shows that the director at least tried to capture as much of the novel as possible. And, as with any film adaptation of a great novel, Bulgakov fans can find plenty to chide the director over with missing elements some may consider essential and for me, at least, the heavy-handed inclusion of footage of the NKVD's ""Great Terror"", ""Moscow Trials"" and other Stalinist attrocities. The obviously unique NKVD uniforms should be enough, especially when their presence is only lightly implied in the novel (for obvious Stalinist reasons).

Again, if you haven't read the novel or do not have an understanding of the Russian language, history and culture, the film will most likely not appeal to you. I say this because of the absolutely wretched English subtitles. They are more confusing than helpful and if someone is not familiar with the work, they will be bored senseless. I have no idea who is responsible for the subtitles, but they remind me of the simultaneous translations done on bootleg American films shown in Moscow on ""pirate"" TV channels in the early 1990s. It would have been far more satisfying, to have had the subtitiles done professionally. In ""Burnt by the Sun,"" for example, the quality subtitles, well-placed images and acting were enough to convey the unspoken, yet ever-present danger of NKVD ""Troikas"" or becoming part of Stalin's ""Purges.""

In all, I could enjoy the film, despite its defects. The producers were not working with a Peter Jackson size budget and it was made for television - Russian television. The subtitles were obviously an afterthought. No films, even Peter Jackson's, can live up to the novels that engendered them.",1236556800,3,2006,4.949554896142433

2511722,4,B000EADJEU,"After a few film stabs at Bulgakov's novel, stabs which tended to end up like the overly ambitious Vicenza's nobles' Palladio designed homes - mostly facade - this very long adaptation now offers a much longer and fuller reading of what heretofore appeared an impossible challenge - making film sense of the convoluted triparite plot of this 20th century masterpiece. The storyline has been followed in order, and most, though not all, of the endless subplots depicting Stalinist Russia are trotted out. Unfortunately, not everything is equally well done, and frankly the material calls for a more breathless treatment, especially for the scenes in then contemporary Russia. Much of the film is paced far too slowly for Bulgakov. (See, for example, in contrast the film version of Bulgakov's Ivan the Terrible, where Elizabeth I's Russian counterpart is brought back by the comic deux ex machine par excellent, a Time Machine, to modern day Moscow. Ivan the terrible is switched with the lowest imagineable official, an apartment manager, for very ripe comdey indeed.) To a great extent I tend to side with reviewer MMM and his thoughts about tone or the lack of contrast in the dramatic presentations.

  Also problematic, seen today, seventy years later, the historical story and the modern story, between the Master and Margarita's biblical story and the present day events (sic) have out of necessity taken on an unintended dual historical perspective - for today's viewers Stalinist Moscow is as much a part of the past as Pilate's Judea. The director never offers an acceptable film solution to this real quandary.

 Therefore - Important caveat: Prospective viewers should be strongly warned against watching the film until or unless they have read the novel. Much more than is usually the case, the ins and outs of Bulgakov's delicious satire should first be experienced in the written word.

  Some unacceptable - at least for me - odd choices: the devil in the novel is seven feet tall and extremely extroverted - not a regular grand signeur as cast in the film. Behemoth, the giant cat, is very disappointing indeed as a small person inside a cat costume. (I thought that sort of costuming went out with the silent film Peter Pan's Nana, an obvious person romping around in an animal costume.) On the plus side, while some of the witches give people heart palpitations, the actress playing Margarita is so strikingly beautiful she might actually revive the dead; while the cut throat Azazello could fit right in with the underworld characters of Brecht's Three Penny Opera Berlin.

  Another and major point for me - the film fails to hammer and sickle out the depths of the Stalinist terror. Bulgakov's novel tends to show this nightmare obliquely, in a complex mirror made up of a lifetime's gathering of theatrical tricks. Not surprising, given how carefully he was monitored. Modern viewers don't quite sense the extent of what's up since the State Police's use of death and torture is never directly shown. Bulgakov further, and probably out of self-defense, muddies his waters of responsibilty by transferring questions of life and death into the hands of Fate, or as often as not, a reading of the Stars or Tarot cards. The Devil and his grotesque coherts cheerfully point out what lies in store for victims, save in the case of the odious informer Baron Maigle, who they kill themselves. They do scare the life out of a few poor souls, but usually it all has a moral edge, and a large comic impact.

  Perhaps the film's director could have better aided modern viewers - largely ignorant of the NKVD - by showing the great poet Akhmatova vainly waiting outside the walls of the Police Station for information on her missing husband, with no news and no one telling her or the others lining up in the frigid snow the status of their arrested spouses, friends, and children. Such a touch might overweight things, but it might add a necessary human connection absent the current versions assumptions. It certainly would buttress and parallel both the love story between the Master and Margarita, and the terror behind the novel's endless events of arrests and human disappearances.

  High points - the Crucifixion scenes - or a low point if you will - the Variety theater show; and the wild behavior of Margarita Nikolayevna after she puts on the magic cream. The director did, however, fail to carefully depict the Nabokovian touch of the black velvet slippers. Also Margarita's hair is already curly before she adds the cream - it's supposed to change after. Etc. ect. The maid riding the pig was cute, in every possible way!

  Not a great film, but a good one. I've seen a few Bulgakov plays, and they really crackle like firecrackers at a Chiness New Year. The movie doesn't percolate often enough on a truly Gogolian heat. However, considering the degree of difficulty this effort, like a higher rated dive off the 10 meter board, easily deserves at least four stars.

  PLEASE NOTE: Along with violence and beheadings this film contains more nudity than a Playboy mansion skinny dipping party: the film is absolutely NOT for children!

2511723,1,B000EADJEU,"First and foremost, the director (Bortko) misinterpreted Bulgakov. And I don't buy this matter-of-interpretation argument here. If a composer wrote his piece to be played forte, you can't play it piano. If a writer wrote his novel with humor, you should not be crying over it. Before the film, I have never suspected that Bulgakov's novels can be interpreted as ""sad."" His humor and satire were legendary. When you read his contemporaries, you see something like, ""Bulgakov read from his new novel. Everyone laughed."" It applies to most of his novels (his first novel, ""The White Guard"" is the only exception). One's supposed to laugh while reading Bulgakov. Bortko did the opposite in both his ""Heart of a Dog"" and ""Master and Margarita"" - both films are depressing.

Furthermore, his selection of actors is horrible. Woland must be a man ""a little over forty,"" not 71 (Basilashvili). Kirill Lavrov (80 at the time) who plays Pontius Pilate, sure looks like an 80-year old. ""...with  the shuffling gait of  a cavalryman... there came out ... the procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate."" Note, not the shuffling gait of a social security recipient, but a cavalryman, a big difference. Koroviev is horrible. Instead of a young, dynamic, energetic jester, Abdulov, 52, plays a stupid, grandiloquent jerk.

The costumes and the set are cheap and bad. Just look at Margarita's attire at the ball - a hybrid of a chastity belt and Amazon's armor. And the Cat!!! An actor wearing a cat's mask! That's 21st century cinema alright!

Lots of scenes omotted. And lots of director's own (to compensate for the omitted ones?) The most ridiculous is the lecture at the end. Just wondering where did this strange military man resembling Beria come from? Besides, too much of NKVD (the forerunner of the KGB) officers in full uniform. Bulgakov never even uses this acronym in his novel; it's always a hint, always implied. Here - ""At  around  four  o'clock  on that hot day,  a big  company of  men  in civilian clothes got out of three cars a  short distance from  no. 502-bis on Sadovaya  Street.""

So is it really ""respectful, thoughtful and as close to the spirit of the greatest Russian novel of the last century as possible?""
