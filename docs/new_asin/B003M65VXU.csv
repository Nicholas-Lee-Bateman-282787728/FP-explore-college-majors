8400117,5,B003M65VXU,Very informative and a fascinating topic.  So sad there is not more information on this topic elsewhere but glad to have this video at least.,1523923200,,141,4.64
8400118,2,B003M65VXU,"This is a documentary about many of the significant Catholic churches in Rome. It contains some beautiful imagery and computer animation, but should be relegated to the trash bin based on some very poisonous ideas contained within.

Two warning signs presented themselves straight off in this so-called documentary. It began with a cynical quote credited to a 15th century Pope, declaring that a Faith based on doctrine alone was too weak to long survive, but a Faith reinforced by grand public monuments and magnificent buildings would overawe the multitudes and secure their loyalty. So what we're to take away from this video is the message, reflected in the official amazon.com product synopsis, that Catholics have clung to Catholicism only because of the awesome art and architecture.

Moving along, the narrator also tells us that indulgences promised salvation to the buyer, an assertion so risible and counter-factual that it could have been written by Martin Luther himself. That kind of major error condemns this video outright. And yet Catholic actor Brian Denehey narrates it, Catholic media promotes and sells it, Catholic parishes have shown this to audiences as some sort of evangelization tool, and the back of the DVD even credits the video as having restored vitality to Catholicism in America! Are we so stupid that we have completely lost the ability to understand words? Are beautiful buildings really the only reason we are Catholic?",1379635200,4,1456,5.217948717948718
8400119,5,B003M65VXU,I appreciated the historical presentation. I am going on pilgrimage and this will help in my understanding of the facts as I visit holy sites. Very inspiring.,1376524800,,158,4.888888888888889
8400120,5,B003M65VXU,"This is a well-researched story from history that is presented in an interesting and cohesive format.  I would recommend that anyone planning a trip to Rome view this prior to their visit.  I'm on my third trip to Rome and this filled in a lot of blanks and answered a lot of questions. The presentation is made in a respectful and tasteful manner, not in the sensationalized tabloid manner of so many modern productions about the Church and the Vatican.  Forget Dan Brown and watch this.  True history is far more interesting than hokey conspiracy theories.",1332547200,4,558,4.78125

Money! Power! Religion! Obsolescence overshadowed by lasting works of magnificent architecture! All the right ingredients for a riveting documentary, no?

Having seen the film, I now understand what the Via Papale is and how it came to be so influential in the survival of Catholicism. One of the interview subjects explains that ""Via Papale"" translates not only to a physical road on which the Popes traveled for festival days; it also has a connotation of an intangible route. The way to become and be a Pope.

Via Papale might as well be a verb: To Build. To Create. To Live On.
The film is beautifully shot and makes sparing but practical use of special effects (an animated time line, for instance, handily marks the reign of each influential pope, while a moving map of the Via Papale is used throughout the film to orient viewers to landmarks).

A combination of Dennehy's capable narration and interviews with passionate, personable religious and historical experts tells the story of how the road demanded the buildings, then the buildings demanded the road, and then the entire route (the tangible one) was lost to modernization and Mussolini's parade routes. The score is also lovely, though sound effects -marching soldiers, horses in battle, etc- sometimes overpowered the narration.

My favorite part of this film was the chance to see gorgeous art and architecture in a place I may never get a chance to visit in person. The famous domes of Rome, spires, cupolas, columns, master frescoes and murals, saints -and popes of course- on the walls and altars... Beautiful. Apparently it's also the first movie shot in High Definition in Rome, and let me tell you, it's much more vibrant than that postcard set you bought at the museum gift shop.

I understand that Catholics and Catholic organizations are the main audience for this film, being a built-in niche audience and all. But anyone who appreciates art, or church history, or western politics, or architecture will find something to learn and  many amazing things to look at.

Update:
Via Paple recently won both a ""Remi"" and a ""Special Jury Selection""
award at the 2010 WorldFest Houston International Film Festival.",1292112000,8,2370,5.335120643431635
