937554,5,630478578X,"I am a big fan of Arthur Miller, especially ""The Crucible"" and ""Death of a Salesman"". This production of ""Salesman"" misses nothing in it's depiction of a confused man in the midst of suicide.  Dustin Hoffman is brilliant. I loved it!!!",940636800,4,235,4.7317073170731705

Malcovich (as usual)leaves his  distinctive mark as a true actor and assists all who were involved in  creating this film in sending one of the most important messages one can  offer the world...a message concerning true living.,923788800,3,401,5.633333333333334

7879013,5,630478578X,"Sparse sets set-up the huge dramatic energy of this deceivingly simple story.  Every actor and actress is outstanding and

the power, range, and depth of the performance is incredible.

Bristling with raw force, the drama digs through the layers

of mid-america near mid-century, creating a powerful historical

testament.  The stars were aligned for Miller, Hoffman, Malkovic and the rest for this dynamic theatre.  Pathos.",1130457600,4,424,5.53125
7879014,5,630478578X,"I watched the movie for a class in college.
When I first started watching the movie I was less than enthusiastic about it. I wasn't a big fan of movies based on plays, or Dustin Hoffman. Watching a movie about a guy losing his mind just didn't seem like it could be a good movie. However after getting involved in the movie and really seeing what it's about, I think it is a brilliant movie. Dustin Hoffman  plays Willy Loman's part perfectly-couldn't have been any better. He does such a great job, you forget your watching a movie-everything seems so real. The way Willy gets involved in his delusions, most of them about him becoming a `failure' in life and what he did wrong, really add a different perspective. Also, the way that the movie is done in a play like style with basic backgrounds really makes you pay attention to the acting. I think this is an excellent movie, with a brilliant plot and exceptionally talented actors.",1070496000,2,935,4.565476190476191
7879015,5,630478578X,"I first viewed this film in a college class of mine. It was just another boring, uninspired day of studying and curriculum until the teacher used this video for coursework. First off, the performances Malkovich and Hoffman give are absolutely superb, and the performance of the wife of Willy Loman has got to be considered one of the greatest of all time. Although I am unfamiliar with the official praise or criticism of the film (i.e. if it won any Oscars), months later I was discussing if there ever was such a thing as a masterpiece in American film. My friend suggested Citizen Kane - which I have not seen. Then I remembered this film, and it was clear to me that this must be considered proof that film is an actual Art form. I haven't taken the time to read the screenplay or view other interpretations so I'm not sure if it's the story of Willy Loman itself, or this specific retelling that is so great. Nonetheless, a film in deserved praise of 5 stars.",1015545600,,964,4.482954545454546
7879016,5,630478578X,"""Death of a Salesman,"" by Arthur Miller, is a play that examines the breakdown of the American Dream and family values through the literary lens of social realism.  This particular production, produced at CBS studios in New York during the early 1980's, was considered by Miller himself to be the best interpretation of his play ever produced.  Likewise, he considered Dustin Hoffmann as Willy Loman to be the best interpretation of the play's main character. It is hardly surprising.  Death of a Salesman was the first play Hoffmann ever read, and it is easy to see the play's influence on every role Hoffmann has ever played.  Volker Schlondorff did a fantastic job as director.  His production is extremely faithful to Miller's notes, and although this production was made for television, the shift in medium loses nothing. I am using this two-tape set in my Literature class to show my freshman college students how to ""get inside"" a play and to realize that reading a script is not nearly as effective as seeing it acted out.  This really is a magnificent production that presents the script with integrity and then gives you the chance to see the ""guts"" of the play.",1005436800,10,1172,4.835
7879017,5,630478578X,"This 1985 version was actually a TV movie using most of the original cast from the 1984 version of the Broadway play first written by Arthur Miller in 1949.  Since then it has been performed many many times with a variety of different casts.  A million years ago I even remember studying it in college.  I have always wanted to see the play and was thrilled that I discovered this video.
Dustin Hoffman stars as Willie Loman, a fading traveling salesman who has made all the wrong decisions in his life.  A young John Malkovich plays his son, Biff, a jobless loser.  Steven Lang, is cast as his other son, Happy; Linda Reid plays Willie Loman's wife; and Charles Durning plays his neighbor, Charlie.  All have been nominated for a variety of awards and Dustin Hoffman won a Golden Globe for best actor that year.
There is no doubt that this is a play, not a movie by the way it is staged. Flashbacks are achieved, for example, by the character Biff, coming on stage in a High School sweater. The characters often seem to be speaking directly to the audience also.  I found all this refreshing after watching so many movies where computerized cinematography and special effects are everything.
This play doesn't need special effects.  It is all in the words and the acting.  And what fine acting it is!  I forgot how good a play can be! Especially one by Arthur Miller.  The Director, Volker Shloendorff, made his American debut with this production, his prior experience being only in France and Germany.  For drama at its finest, I definitely recommend this video.",983491200,9,1565,4.671532846715328
7879018,5,630478578X,"I wish they would put this on DVD.  I read other reviews saying things  like Hoffman provides an ""insect""-like portrayal of Willy...  well, I think it's PERFECT!  The chemistry between all the actors in this  is incredible.  I find it unfortunate that the popularity of this movie  seems low, since many think Hoffman's shining moment is ""Rainman""  or something... though he was good in that, this is an ultimate  performance.  I particularly enjoy how the ""live"" stage feeling  is used throughout the production, and you, the camera, are taken in to the  Lowman homestead.  I get chills EVERY time I see the climactic scene in the  kitchen, and also the scene when Malkovitch grabs Hoffman's wrist &  says ""stop yelling at her.""  WOW. 5 stars for a stunning  performance by all.  Not a 'upper' kind of film, but certainly a deep and  reflective one.",961200000,5,850,4.777777777777778
7879019,4,630478578X,"Unfortunately, Hoffman's performance as Willy Lowman will probably be eclipsed by Dennehey's performance in Chicago the summer past. Hoffman has said this was his favorite role ever, and it's easy to see why as you watch  him fumble through the machinations of the postwar arena of business  competition and ""keeping up with the Joneses."" John Malkovitch as  Biff perhaps wasn't the greatest casting choice--Malkovitch seems more  befuddled than enraged at Willy half the time. Still, all the heat and  feeling meant to be seen on the stage is accurately captured here, right  down to the riveting tete-a-tete between Biff and Willy, Biff yelling  ""I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that?"" With those lines,  Miller managed to reign in a new era of self-reflection and value in  American society.",952992000,3,801,5.1953125
7879020,5,630478578X,"I believe this movie to be a definitive version of Miller's work.  The tone, mood, and imagery in this interpretation capture the essence of Willy Loman's life and death.
I cannot say enough about the acting - Dustin  Hoffman and John Malkovich lead the cast with performances of the absolute  highest order!  They deliver a poignance and a gravity unmatched in recent  cinema.  Their drama is enhanced by the superb supporting cast; each  supporting character adds both depth and clarity to the two protagonists.  The unseen sides of Willy and Biff become visable to us through their  interactions with the small core cast.
I would be most interested in  Arthur Miller's views on this adaptation.",951955200,7,697,4.982608695652174
7879021,1,630478578X,"I just viewed the 1985 Dustin Hoffman version of ""Salesman"" and I have to say that this version is pretty bad in comparison to others.  Dustin Hoffman portrays Willie like a little insignificant insect, not as a  powerful demanding person.  John Malcovich is offbeat as Biff, and Kate  Reid missed the boat as Linda.  This does not however, mean I dislike the  play. THe play is marvelously written and is a classic.  If you want to see  the show done right, I recommend the Brian Dennehy/Elizabeth Franz version.  THat one gets 4 stars.",951350400,6,537,4.688172043010753
