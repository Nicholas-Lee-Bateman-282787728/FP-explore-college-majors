Usually I'm right on it, but I did not expect this ending. The ending made the whole movie, not to mention the really, really cute guys, especially

7959213,4,B000063K04,"really enjoyed this horror movie; it is much better than other reviews make it to be. Its not very gorey or scarey but it's still an enjoyable, low budget slasher movie with a good twist in the end. Definatly worth-while watching if you have nothing better to do on a Friday or Saturday night.",1237334400,,293,4.444444444444445

quality time for a non quality movie.",1137456000,,158,4.642857142857143
7959215,1,B000063K04,This movie gets gory within the first few minutes and continues.  I finally had to turn it off because I found it quite stupid.  Not worth a -1!,1136851200,,144,4.107142857142857
7959216,1,B000063K04,"David DeCoteau's _Sixth Sense_ ripoff is dull beyond belief.  Even the requisite beefcake shots look shoddy.
Like many of DeCoteau's more recent films, _The Frightening_ was filmed in widescreen and released on DVD in full-frame format.  Image cropping is noticeable and sound is just plain bad.
Avoid.",1037664000,3,302,5.404255319148936
7959217,2,B000063K04,"This film was ok for what it is, but not DeCoteau's best. Not nearly enough boys-in-boxer-briefs scenes!  If you're looking for a flick in the homo-horror genre, definitely get Voodoo Academy (the DVD); it's the best of the lot. Brotherhood 1 and 2 are both okay.",1036022400,4,263,4.717391304347826
7959218,5,B000063K04,"What would have been a typical teen slasher/horror flick has two saving graces: The strong performance by Jack Carlisle III as Perry, who carries the movie, and the twist of an ending still has me surprised.",1035676800,2,207,4.777777777777778
7959219,4,B000063K04,"For a direct-to-dvd ""B""-type movie, this was a pretty decent movie.  Some of the cast might even have a future...  The basic premise of the movie is that a high school (where students have a way of disappearing) is in fact a portal to hell, or something like that...Most of the young cast is pretty decent, although I think plot is somewhat unimportant to this movie, which at times borders on a soft-core homoerotic flick.  Not that that's a bad thing...Corey Haim fans, rejoice, the lead actor bears a more than slight resemblance to the 80's bad-boy.  Overall, I think it's worth a watch...You might even end up buying it...as I plan to...",1018483200,16,642,4.654867256637168
