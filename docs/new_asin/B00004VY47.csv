7924283,5,B00004VY47,"***** 1954. A movie based on Roy Chanslor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Guitar/dp/B000TZM2Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Guitar</a>&nbsp;and directed by Nicholas Ray. This DVD doesn't offer any bonus features and the copy, in Trucolor, is of average quality. Joan Crawford asks Sterling-Johnny Guitar-Hayden to protect her against Mercedes McCambridge and his friends who accuse her to be the accomplice of the Dancin' Kid. Huge and incredibly intelligent western that propelled Nicholas Ray among the top American directors of the 50's. The work on the colours is superb especially if one thinks of the vulcano metaphor that starts with the explosions caused by the railroad company and ends with the burning of Vienna's saloon. One of the ten best American westerns ever made. Masterpiece.",1205366400,,851,6.282051282051282
7924284,5,B00004VY47,The finest lesbian western ever! Watch it as a simple entertainment or as a wonderland of Freudian symbolism; either way you'll be mesmerized and astonished.  Highly recommended!,1174780800,3,178,5.592592592592593
7924285,5,B00004VY47,"I first saw this movie some years ago and completely fall in love with it. The story, the actors, the directing, cinematography, et caetera.

Joan Crawford's Vienna & Mercedes McCambridge's Emma are the most unbelievable woman characters in Western movies. At first we see them both wearing colours for each state of the spirit. Vienna in black. Emma in green. It's a diversion from Nicholas Ray. In the course of the film the costumes colours are changed to match the true nature of the characters.

I think Emma is THE most evil woman character in cinema history. Those evil eyes when she spread fire over 'Vienna's Saloon' is speechless... And - now - she wears black and Vienna a long bright white dress.

In a very fabulous 'camp' aesthetic, 'Johnny Guitar' is unique.",1147478400,5,773,4.796992481203008
7924286,5,B00004VY47,"This is an old school western with a tough as nails lady who owns a saloon against a town of overbearing, gas bag, judgemental townsfolk. The movie is a wonderful trip back in time to a simpler hollywood where good guys are tall rugged and handsome and play a mean guitar. The women are as rough and tumble and can sling a six gun as fast as any man and Ernest Borgnine is a big old barrel chested gorilla that will brawl with the hero toe to toe, fist a flyin'. Sterling Hayden is the perfect hero and Joan Crawford with her big eyes and quick draw delivery is perfect as the heroine. This movie is a fun western and I highly recommend it.",1140048000,3,640,4.169354838709677
7924287,5,B00004VY47,"What does it mean to BE a MAN?  Vienna (Joan Crawford), saloon owner, independent thinker, proto feminist, ambitious enough to own the world and lover of REAL men,  will tell you. How do you make a great movie? Study Nicholas Ray VERY carefully and this film in particular. A transcendent, stunning film, which is a rich viewing experience, it is also worthy of study.  Not a wasted word, rich characters played at full tilt by all concerned - Ernest Borgine the baddest and you can tell by his lousy hat;  Scott Brady the miner and gang leader whose handsome and upright character is held in a little doubt because he is a left hand draw; Mercedes Cambridge (Emma) a bundle of unadulterated EMOTION, including LUST, HATE, ENVY; Sterling Hayden who PLAYS Johnny Logan aka Johnny Guitar, the tallest handsomest fastest wittiest hero who also SINGS and plays guitar meaning he also has a SOUL but man, DO NOT get him riled! The small parts include such luminaries as John Carradine and Ward Bond. But it may be Joan Crawford's greatest role as VIENNA. Strong? this woman will stand against a TOWN, ALONE. Sexy? She has had many men but none worthy of her libido to hang around for long, except for Johnny who has returned to claim her. Good employer?  She pays and pays well, and gets the greatest loyalty from her staff who are willing and do, DIE for her - occupational health and safety considerations are set aside for Vienna.  She is ALL woman and ALL man as well.
As well, there is MURDER, MAYHEM, MOB FURY, ORATORY, HOLDUPS (Bank and Stage coach), GOLD, SILVER, MOUNTAINS EXPLODING, UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, FIST FIGHTS, SECRET HIDEOUTS through WATERFALLS, GAMBLING, HANGING, FORGIVENESS, REDEMPTION, SACRIFICE, and LOVE TRIUMPHANT.
There is also a HAUNTING music theme, lurid photography, costumes to delight, and MUCH MORE.
This film is a transendent movie experience and if it is true that Mr Scorsese likes the film I can understand why.",1137369600,17,1942,4.8343373493975905
7924288,5,B00004VY47,"I had occasion to watch this recently on Encore's Western channel -- what a bizarre, deeply Freudian, out-is-in, upside down ""Western"" this is.  This is truly a case of ""What was the studio thinking""?  Nicholas Ray passed this off as a Western in the same sense the original Star Trek was just about spaceships and aliens.  Over the top from start to finish in a controlled, very disciplined way, all that's missing is Spock weighing in at the end about what we all learned.

I can't even begin to describe the plot, other than it's a symbolistic allegory about two strong women fighting over land and men, the weak-willed, flawed men who they love or lust over, the railroad, communism, the 50s blacklist, a guitar slinger who's an ex-gunslinger, drugs....

I could go on, but it must be watched to be believed.  Add to this a fabulous cast including a young Ernest Borginine and you have a heady symbolistic stew that has all the elements of a revival if this can be properly released on DVD.  Martin Scorcese, we know you love this movie, bring this one back to the masses please!",1137369600,7,1083,4.609375
