8761690,3,B01FWXZFCW,"I added this comment on the Full Moon DVD release, mostly to comment on the image quality and a potential issue about the length of this movie. This 1977 film was originally entitled to as Frauen im Liebeslager, and is part of the German collaboration between director Jess Franco and producer Erwin Dietrich, who also wrote the script here. About the story, a group of women are kidnapped, transported to some South American country, and forced to be sex slaves for a group of revolutionaries (a guerrilla). As you might guess from movies alike, including the Ilsa series, a warden woman plays the nasty and sadistic character. There no explicit gory violence here. Instead, one gets lots of women (some male) nudity through >90% of the movie, and softcore scenes. Overall, an average film among its kind. Those Franco aficionados may feel this movie goes a bit more on Dietrich side than Francos (I did).

Technically, this is a Full Moon, region free DVD release. The image  is in widescreen format, pretty clean, with clear colors, most likely because the image has been digitally restored before by Ascot Elite for the European market. The audio comes as dubbed English. As you might guess, only a German audio would be worse than the dubbed English audio provided; the accents are funny though. Extras include an audio interview with the maestro, and the trailer.

Finally, and my main motivation to write this review, the main feature length here runs at nearly 79 minutes, not the 101 minutes advertised in the back cover of this DVD release. This mistake by Fooling Moon remains suspicious to me as IMDB indicates this movie to originally run over that same extended length. So, I really wonder whether a full, uncut, or extended version of this piece of cinema do exists.",1504224000,2,1781,4.8519736842105265

8761697,3,B01FWXZFCW,"One of Spanish sexploitation maestro Jess Franco's earliest directorial outings featured a 'women in prison' plot line and it was a great commercial success. Never one to 'rest on his laurels' Franco generated numerous 'knock-offs' of his own formula during the course of his ridiculously prolific career and ""Love Camp"" is one of them. Technically, this isn't actually a WIP film as the featured females have been kidnapped (rather than legally incarcerated) and held by a group of Marxist(?) rebels to serve as prostitutes for the freedom fighters. That minor plot point aside, ""Love Camp"" plays out exactly like numerous other WIP films set in a jungle locale. All of the requisite scenes of: naked showers, lesbian liaisons, punitive whippings, and forced sex are represented and the captured girls are all naked throughout. As with most Franco flix the 'plot' exists primarily to provide some kind of framework for the nude girls to prance around and this movie offers a particularly simplistic scenario and lots of nudity in the attractive female cast - so I guess it could be considered a success. Franco worked with a German cast and production crew on this one and there is a bit of a physical disconnect between the purported Latin American setting of the film and the decidedly Germanic look of the actors - especially the blonde 'rebel leader' Chino who looks like he would have been more at home in an ""Illsa"" flik. There was also a strong sense of deja vu as the jungle setting for the 'love camp' has been used in at least two other Franco films I've seen. In summation - certainly 'nothing you haven't seen before' in this one - essentially just a good excuse to parade some comely female flesh around - one of Franco's lesser efforts. On th 'plus' side - the DVD quality is excellent and it does have an English soundtrack and lots of extras.",1316822400,8,1859,4.77639751552795
