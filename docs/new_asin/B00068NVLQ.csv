2175460,5,B00068NVLQ,"O Yey-ahh!,

  After many long years of anticipation(almost shelled out the fortune for the Japanese laser discs-but the patience payed off) Season 1 DVD released today...currently up to disc 4 in my zone-a-thon and all the memories are strobing strong-a nice way to end the year! Many,many wicked episodes-ideal for 3AM nocturnals. Paid $50 and change,not bad for 59 stories divided into 24 episodes on 6 discs",1104192000,3,411,5.104477611940299
2175461,5,B00068NVLQ,"This is one of the rare series that does justice to the original series from which it is spawned.  Granted, nothing can beat the original (and the reviewer who says that he doesn't want to bother with the original because it was in black and white just leaves me speechless).

For those of us who can actually appreciate fine television, however, the 1980's series is a fine complement to Rod Serling's masterful series.  Episodes such as ""Shatterday"", ""The Shadow Man"" and ""Examination Day"" truly do justice to the great one.

NOTE: Robert Klein starred in ""Wordplay"", not Elliot Gould.  Gould starred in ""The Misfortune Cookie"", also in Season One.",1104192000,4,650,4.926605504587156
2175462,5,B00068NVLQ,"What a great series this was!  I wish  they aired it on TV through the years but FINALLY it is worth the wait to have it on DVD. As a young boy (now 32 y/o) I remember watching this series in amazment every week  and loved all the episodes.  My favorite was the episode called ""WORDPLAY"" with Elliot Gould and how words were changing and he couldn't adapt to the world around him. I remember Breakfast was now Dinosaur  and it really screwed with his head!  Boy I loved this show...The borrom line is BUY IT  you will not be disappointed!",1103673600,2,538,4.267326732673268
2175463,5,B00068NVLQ,"There are two phrases I've been waiting for for years... one, ""Republic Home Video will be releasing 'Beauty and the Beast' starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton to DVD later in 2005"", and two, ""CBS and Viacom Home Video announce the release of the 1985 version of 'The Twilight Zone'"". One down...

I'm so stoked to see the best presentation of this series finally make it to DVD. It eliminates a big chunk of my VHS collection in favor of the new format. The final great performance of Danny Kaye in ""Paladin of the Last Hour"" is worth the price of the set alone.",1102377600,4,567,4.451923076923077
2175464,5,B00068NVLQ,"This 1985 Season One version of The Twilight Zone is an outstanding series and should not be confused with the mediocre 2002 version. This was the sequel to the classic Rod Serling series and featured some great stories that were very well written. It has all sorts of stories-science fiction,romance,horror,comedy,satire,fantasy stories and is an outstanding series. The opening titles include a one second animation of Rod Serling as a salute to the original creator.
The Twilight Zone 1985 Season One DVD set has 24 one hour episodes with 59 stories.
It is unique in that the stories vary from 10 minutes to 45 minutes and it is the only series that I have seen that did this.
This series had scripts and stories from some of the best writers around-people like Richard Matheson,Steven King,Harlan Ellison,Arthur C Clarke,Ray Bradbury and Alan Brennert.
It has scripts adapted from many published quality stories.
This TZ series also had some top movie directors like William Friedkin,Wes Craven,Joe Dante and Jeannot Szwarc.
The William Friedkin directed episode ""Nightcrawlers"" was described by one CBS television executive as ""the most intense television he had ever seen"",a very atmospheric episode with brilliant direction.
The series starts with the episode ""Shatterday"" which features Bruce Willis in his television debut. Fans with good memories will note that when answering the phone,Bruce says ""is that crazy Willy"",a line that he repeated in the movie ""Armegeddon"".
The episode ""Paladin Of The Lost Hour"" features the great classic movie star Danny Kaye in his final performance,and a great acting performance it is. Morgan Freeman also stars in an episode about a men's card game that gets a visit from the devil.
Other actors include Oscar winner Martin Landau,Peter Coyote,William Peterson,Elliot Gould and Ben Cross.
There is an in joke in one episode,called ""Devils Alphabet"",where Ben Cross(star of the movie Chariots Of Fire)chases a horse drawn coach that is on fire. Obviously,the writers have a sense of humour.
This first season also features such actresses as Melinda Dillon(Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind)Dee Wallace Stone(ET),Jenny Agutter(Logans Run),Helen Mirren,Victoria Tennant and Pam Dawber(Mork and Mindy). There are also many Star Trek actors in these Twilight Zone episodes-Jonathon Frakes,Brent Spiner,John de Lancie(from ST:The Next Generation),Andrew Robinson(ST:DS9)and Robert Duncan McNeil(ST:Voyager). Andrew Robinson plays President Kennedy in an eccellent episode called ""Profile In Silver"" which is about a time traveller going back in time to document and film the assassination.
This set is in stereo and has 12 commentaries,an interview with director Wes Craven and a photo gallery. It is well worth having for fans that want a quality series with great stories.
One other reason to buy this set-considering the picture and sound have been remastered,the price for this set is remarkable when compared to some of the other TV series box sets around.",1097884800,233,3001,5.428265524625267
2175485,3,B00068NVLQ,"This was a very busy time in my life, and I missed many of this 1980's remake of the Twilight Zone. Some of the segments are pretty good ... typical Rod Sterling, but many were simply silly. It still beats the weak cable schedulings on TV, and enables us to find ""something"" to watch when there's NOTHING on TV. I only purchased the first season, though, and doubt I'll purchase the other 3 seasons.",1402444800,,399,4.405405405405405

contains a DVD and every one was shattered on top. Also no insert
was inside even though the case was factory sealed. The problem
may have been due to the carrier but being the DVD's were fine I
decided to keep the set as it is hard to find if you can find it
at all. I also ordered the second and third season (which are both

2175499,4,B00068NVLQ,"I bought this set YEARS ago and I'm JUST NOW getting around to watching it. I haven't noticed any issues with audio quality at all and the video quality is adequate. What I can't understand is WHY (since there are several episodes on a disc) do some of the discs not have ""Play ALL Episodes"" and some disc do? Strange! Usually you have the option to play title/chapter or ALL episodes? Not on this (at least on some discs) Other discs DO have a ""play all"". It's kind of inconsistent as far as that goes. It kind of grips at me because sometimes I like putting the dvd in and choosing play all to let it play through automatically.

As for the series. I remember watching this when it premiered on CBS in Sept 1985. LOVED IT! Some stories are better than others as was the case with the original version as well. I personally think any original TZ fan will want to own this.",1314835200,,873,4.290909090909091

2175502,5,B00068NVLQ,"Greetings;

Not to say bad though, just certainly different. I have yet to watch the whole of the series, which I do in fact now own, but from everthing I have seen thus far, the major difference between the original Rod Serling Twilight Zone and even the more recent series from 2000 and this one is that the other two had a host to speak of. Someone to step in-the show was moving along as the events  unfolded but soon enough, from out of nowhere or even perhaps from out of the faceless crowd, the host would appear. Someone to, with an authoratitive hand point out the cast of characters in the play unfolding before us. That is what had always set those series aside. With this particular series though, the Twilight Zone of the 80's, you just don't so far seem to have that. Oh, to be sure it is a good show, really it is, but honestly, twilight zone at this point seems almost tacked on. It could just as well been 'Tales from the Dark Side.' Which in many ways, really is what it feels more like. If anyhthing, some faceless voice is heard from aside to tell you a bit about what happens or to wrap things up, it just doesn't hold the same appeal that made the other two Twilight Zone shows really stand out. I still like is though so far.
My only real complaint is trivial at best, the packaging. The disks are held in a series of stacking clear pleastic trays that are bound together by a blue strip of tape, I mean, it works, yes, but if it should tear or something, they would just stack. Would have preferred something a bit sturdier. Thank you and take care...",1293580800,2,1575,4.299663299663299
2175503,5,B00068NVLQ,"I really like the shows that were on the dvd's. I watched them when they first came on TV.

2175528,5,B00068NVLQ,"This is the DVD set of the first season for the ""new"" Twilight Zone season that aired during 1985-86.  The distinctive stories of the original series has carried over to the new series with many stories penned by many well known science fiction writers.  The video quality appears similar to how I saw the series on TV back in the 1980s (on a High Definition televison, there is no crisp clear picture and sound).  As another reviewer has mentioned, the TV series video archives material only consisted of old videotapes and no film negatives and the video transfer quality was limited.  However, this DVD is still very nicely packaged that consists of an episode summary brochure and each of the six DVDs are on a separate plastic page holder which provides an excellent protection to each DVD.  Two episodes of what I consider to be among the best of this series are in this set - ""A Message from Charity"" (episode 6) and ""Her Pilgrim Soul"" (episode 12).  For older viewers, Danny Kaye is featured in one episode before he died - ""Paladin of the Lost Hour""  (episode 7).  The DVD set also has audio commentary from the stars and production crew that provides detailed discussions of each episode that alone is the worth the cost of the DVD set.  Even though Rod Serling was not alive to see this remake of his original series, I am sure that he would have approved.",1266192000,2,1367,4.592592592592593

""This is CBS"" were the popular and famous words that used to come on the air, reminding the viewer that they were watching not just another network, but THE network for the best programming.  The New Twilight Zone surpassed for its time even the former series (the original) with Rod Serling, with some quite pictorially interesting and intriguing aspects of TV-making that seriously enthralls the reader with amazement.  From ""Nightcrawlers"" to ""The Shadow Man"" this set has the best of the best of the New Twilight Zones.  Season 2 and 3 were lacking a bit when it came to new substance and good stuff, but Season 1 here truly takes the cake.

I grew up watching the evolution of television science fiction beginning with the long-forgotten ""Science Fiction Theater,"" and it's doubtful that even Rod Serling could have gotten episodes like ""The Star,"" ""Quarantine"" and ""Dead Run"" into his original ""Twilight Zone"" series.  Of course they might never have aired at all were it not for the path he helped clear.  The new series of the mid-80's, like the original one, was a historical event.

2175538,2,B00068NVLQ,"I must preface this review by explaining that I am in my early 20s and had never followed this show. I bought this DVD set because I LOVE the original Twilight Zone and science fiction anthology series in general (The New Outer Limits, Night Visions, etc). Even the 2002 Twilight ZOne was bearable. I figured this would be at least as good judging by all the positive reviews.

However, my advice to younger TZ fans is be careful about buying this if you haven't watched this version before. I planned to watch a few episodes on an overseas trip. Whether I watched it on the plane or in the hotel room, I would barely make it through one episode before I fell asleep. I have since found a few genuinely good episodes. But this series can be EXTREMELY CHEEZY. Sometimes it's because of poor graphics. Sometimes it's because of bad acting. Sometimes the ending to an episode is just out of place.

If you used to watch the series and know you will enjoy it, then by all means buy it. But if you're unfamiliar with this series and are just looking for good Sci Fi entertainment. Be prepared to watch a lot of garbage episodes before you find the few treasures.",1221004800,3,1157,4.452830188679245
2175539,5,B00068NVLQ,"I am a big fan of anthology series (""The Twilight Zone"", ""Tales From The Crypt"", ""Amazing Stories"", ""The Outer Limits"", ""Tales From The Darkside""), so the 1985 Twilight Zone was something I was interested in seeing. Since I was born in 1986, of course I couldn't watch the series when it aired on CBS. I also never caught it on re-runs like I have every original Twilight Zone episode from 1959 through the early 60's. When I saw it available on dvd, I thought I would buy it to check it out; and I really enojoyed it. One thing I liked right away is that these are hour-long episodes with two or three stories in them. Whether or not I liked every story, I did appreciate the structure of the series. I also liked the theme by the Grateful Dead. As a viewer looking back on something I missed when it aired, of course I viewed it as very nostaligic. Recognizing many actors and actresses who are stars today, whereas if I were watching it back in 1985, I wouldn't know them from Adam because they were either just beginning their careers or not well-known at the time.
To save on space, I will only comment on the first story, which happens to be one of the best of the 1985 series in my opinion....
""Shatterday"" Starring Bruce Willis / Directed by Wes Craven
One of the best episodes of this series. A then unknown Bruce Willis stars as Peter Jay Novins, a man who accidentally dials his own phone number and it's picked up by, to his surprise, Peter Jay Novins. It's an original twist on a classic Twilight Zone episode titled ""Mirror Image"" with Vera Miles as a woman waiting in a train station who encounters her own mirror image trying to take her life over. In ""Shatterday"", however, there is much more reason behind it and character depth that it makes it less scary as ""Mirror Image"" because in ""Mirror Image"", it was not explained why her other self wanted to take over her life so it was more mysterious and, therefore, scary. ""Shatterday"" is more psychologically haunting as it is a character study of a man who fully realizes why this is happening it him. It makes you stop and think about the things you do and how it can effect others as well as yourself. It is a lesson in life and how we live it with sometimes the harshest consequences. Modern master of horror Wes Craven does a masterful job of directing, and Bruce Willis' performance(s) in this episode is some of his best work.
Other four star stories from the series that I put right next to ""Shatterday"" are ""Word Play"" with Robert Klein & Annie Potts, ""Examination Day"", ""A Message From Charity"", ""The Burning Man"" (very terrifying) with Roberts Blossom, ""Dealer's Choice"" with Morgan Freeman, Garrett Morris, M. Emmett Walsh, Barney Martin & Dan Heydaya (all great character actors), ""One Life Furnished In Early Poverty"" with Peter Riegert, ""Her Pilgrim Soul"", ""A Small Talent For War"" with John Glover, ""Need To Know"" with William Petersen & Frances McDormand, ""Shadow Play"" with Peter Coyote, ""Quarentine"", ""Dead Woman's Shoes"" with Helen Mirren & Jeffrey Tambor, ""Dead Run"" with Steve Railsback, ""The Library"" with Lori Petty.
Some of the other stories are good, but the stories that I don't like very much whether they were boring in a non-forgiving way or they were just plain stupid are ""The Elevator"", ""Devil's Alphabet"", ""Tooth Or Consequences"", ""Grace Note"", ""Ye Gods"", ""The Little People Of Killany Woods"", ""The Last Defender Of Camelot"". Even the stories I didn't like were interesting to watch... but only once.
In the end, ""The Twilight Zone (1985)"" is not the best but still a very entertaining and superior anthology series that is a must-own on dvd.",1184284800,5,3642,4.665629860031104
2175540,5,B00068NVLQ,"I am a Sci-Fi fan from way back.  The technology in these stories is, no doubt, old.  But the stores are done so very well.  You can really see the difference between the Mid 80's version and the 21st century version.  The work done by the director is great.  The actors are timeless.  There are some excellent messages in some of these stories.  One in particular is ""The Star"".  I am not overly religious, but this is a good Christmas story for those who wish to focus on the day Christ was born.  Another good story, for the Santa lovers, is; ""Night of the Meek.""  Very heart warming.  Each of these is from Disk 4, episode 13.  Last but not least.  A good, short story, for the quick minded.  On disk 3, episode 12, ""I of Newton.""  Rod Serling would be proud.",1165968000,8,763,4.274647887323944
2175541,3,B00068NVLQ,"I love this series, but I really feel, like some others, that the presentation is shoddy. There have already been lots of grumbles about poor DVD transfers. I can live with the slightly murky, fuzzy picture quality. What is harder to tolerate is the awful sound - easily the worst I've heard on DVD, and much worse than the audio quality on the black and white episodes from the 60s. I've tried turning up the volume to double my normal listening level, and still find some of the dialogue incomprehensible.

Another problem is that the sleeve notes (in the UK at least) have black titles on a dark blue background - almost impossible to read! For a DVD set that costs at least 50 in the UK (about $80 US) I feel more effort was needed.",1154649600,5,736,4.411764705882353

2175543,5,B00068NVLQ,"This is the complete season--there was no wrongful marketing here. The error is with the definition of ""episode."" There were indeed only 24 episodes. It so happens that the episodes were divided into two stories. All of the 59 stories are here, but there are two or more stories per episode, hence only 24 episodes.

2175544,5,B00068NVLQ,"During the 80s, I remember watching the Twilight Zone with my family (along with Amazing Stories, Tales from the Darkside, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents). This DVD set is a compilation of that period of excellent short-storytelling, with all of its twists and fantasy/sci-fi drama.

Some notable stories include ""A Message from Charity"" (my favorite episode), ""Misfortune Cookie"" - a tale about a harsh food critic who goes to a Chinese restaurant that gives magical fortune cookies, and ""Dealer's Choice"" - the episode starring Morgan Freeman who plays a deck of cards with his buddies and the devil.

""A Message from Charity"" is about a guy from 1985 (Robert Duncan Mcneill) who has a telepathic link across time with a Puritan girl (Kerry Noonan). He's a geeky academic who hasn't found any friends yet in school while she is a smart farm girl who hasn't seen or read much outside of the Bible and Shakespeare. This is where their friendship begins to develop. She can see and even taste through his senses - allowing her to experience modern day marvels such as tv, ice cream, flying, and libraries. Upon speaking of her images to a friend, she gets into serious trouble and is accused of witchcraft and it's all his fault, though Charity blames herself for lack of discretion during this period of fanatical superstition. The rest gets pretty interesting and emotional, especially with the romantic tone of the music.. might even bring out a tear or two towards the end. On a side note, it's interesting to see that this being a sort of temporal anomaly episode, two of the actors went on to become major star trek characters - Zefram Cochrane and Tom Paris.

The commentaries are a great addition.",1140134400,6,1703,4.845360824742268
2175555,5,B00068NVLQ,"In my humble opinion, the 1980's Twilight Zone series was the best, purest science fiction on television since the original 60's Outer Limits.  Although it was on the whole more sci-fi oriented than the original TZ, it retained the O'Henry style surprise endings which were the trademark of the original series. It's also interesting to note that the series is very much an artifact of the 80's with it's many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the Reagan era, the yuppies, punk rock, the rise of the PC, and the plight of the Vietnam veterans.

Some of the stories covered in the series were awesome and inspiring, like ""Chameleon"", ""Quarantine"", Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Star"", and Roger Zelazny's ""The Last Defender of Camelot"". Other episodes were hilarious, such as ""But Can She Type"", ""Ye Gods"", and Joe Haldeman's fabulous ""I of Newton"". Some were quite chilling, like ""Nightcrawlers"" (directed by William Friedkin of Exorcist fame) and Ray Bradbury's ""The Burning Man"".  Also, at least one story, ""Dead Woman's Shoes"" featuring the always sexy Helen Mirren, was actually quite erotic. Finally, more than a few of the stories were incredibly powerful and emotive tear-jerkers, like ""Little Boy Lost"", Alan Brennert's ""Her Pilgrim Soul"", and Harlan Ellison's ""Paladin of the Lost Hour"". Have your Kleenex handy; you have been warned.

There is more than enough in this collection to please most any sci-fi and fantasy fan, and I am hard-pressed to think of a truly bad episode. Great writing, directing, acting, and special effects; what's there not to like?  I look forward to purchasing the second volume.",1126396800,15,1616,5.106060606060606

Many of the stories in this piece of 1980s TV I would not class as Twilight Zone but rather basic science fiction. It lacks the belief you have entered the zone and more like, 'stuff happens'. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it is far from the best of Twilight Zone. Good but not that good",1125532800,4,462,4.383720930232558

The Twilight zone in it's original guise was without a doubt the single most important television series ever, it spawned countless imitations and innovations in story telling and episodes plots were used hundreds of times in movies and tv programmes, even to this day some producer or writer somewhere is pinching an idea from it's incredible back catalogue.

Anyway Back to it's 1985/86 incarnation and what you have on offer are some great (Nightcrawlers, the Shadow man, A Matter of Minutes) some not so great (Teachers aide, tooth and consequences, the Beacon) some scary (Gramma, Burning man) some ridiculous (Ye Gods, Wish bank, Red Snow) and some just downright funny (Cold reading, Monsters, i of Newton) but every episode has something to recommend about it even the rubbish ones. It also contains a raritie in the form of a remade episode that actually out shines it's original guise in the classic 'Night of the Meek'. Well worth a day or two of your time and obviously in awe of it's reputation, these episodes are a little short on budget but are ample in heart.

The quality of the dvd transfer is extremely poor though so don't expect more. Enjoy.",1124841600,3,1346,4.723404255319149

2175559,5,B00068NVLQ,"Was it really twenty years ago?  I remember enjoying the 1985-86 season of The Twilight Zone immensely when it was first broadcast, and am so glad to see it on DVD now.  Many of the stories are high-quality science fiction, and even the lighter ones offer great food for thought.  Others have mentioned ""Nightcrawlers,"" ""A Matter of Minutes,"" ""Paladin of the Lost Hour,"" etc. as classics,  but how about ""Dreams for Sale"" -- who wouldn't like to live in that world instead of their workaday one?  ""But Can She Type?"" -- if you've ever been a secretary... excuse me, an administrative assistant, then you KNOW what fantasy this is!

Yes, the picture quality isn't the greatest, which has been well-explained, but I don't find it detracts from the overall experience.  In fact, it kind of gives a ""haze of memory"" to the episodes, as if the '80's hairstyles, clothes, phones, cars, and special effects weren't enough.  Overall, I highly recommend this set.",1121817600,5,954,4.845679012345679
2175560,5,B00068NVLQ,"I have been waiting for this show to come out for years. My brother and I have talked about this happening since I was 10. My favorites then are the same as now, but I have discovered a few extra.

They range from a couple of minutes to a half hour per episode. You never know what you are going to get. I wish there was a run-time for each story within, but beggars can't be choosers.

""Wordplay"" is about a man who has to learn very complex vocabulary for his work, and all of a sudden, certain words in the English language make no sense to him. Eventually, he can't understand anything at all and his child is sick and needs to be taken somewhere, although he doesn't know the name of it.

""Examination Day"" is about a 12 year old boy in the future who is about to take a test that is given to all 12 year olds. They will then decide what will become of his future. Some do not have a future after the test is graded.

One of my very favorites is ""A message from Charity."" Somehow, teenaged boy in the present time comes in contact with a teenaged girl in Puritan New England. They cannot see each other, only hear the words that are being spoken. A mistake is made and her life is in jeopardy, all because of him.

""A Matter of Minutes"" is about a couple who somehow gets stuck between minutes of time. They find out that every single minute is torn down and remade to look exactly like the last. This reminds you of those times where you thought you left something in that spot, only it's not there anymore.

""Button Button"" is about a couple who is desperate for money. They are given a gift. A box with one button in it. If you push the button, you will receive 200,000 dollars. But, someone will die. To push or not to push?

""Little Boy Lost"" is about a woman who gets an overseas photography assignment and has to make a decision between that and staying with her loving boyfriend who desperately wants to have a baby with her. She goes on a local job and meets a boy in the park who looks strangely like he could be her son.

I still have not seen all of the stories. (There are 59 in all) and some are based on stories by famous writers like Sydney Sheldon, Stephen King, and Ray Bradbury. Some are directed by well-known directors like Wes Craven. The stories have an element of the unexpected and strange, which is what makes them so enjoyable.

Of course, as some others have said, the quality on each are not perfect, it ranges from okay to pretty good. I'm just glad to have finally bought it and have it in my collection. I'm really looking forward to the second season.",1119744000,9,2589,4.245934959349594
2175561,4,B00068NVLQ,"Sorry, I'm not really typing a review, but I really don't know other way of knowing which episodes the DVD contains, becouse I didn't find the product here in Brazil. I think it's a very important information about the product that is missing. How can I decide for buying it, if I don't know if it brings the episode I'm looking for(The Library)?",1111968000,4,346,4.507936507936508
2175562,4,B00068NVLQ,"With all the TV shows being released on DVD these days, I hoped and prayed it wouldn't be too long before this show was released on DVD. And when I finally saw it being released this past Christmas, I only hoped my childhood memories wouldn't deceive me on the quality of the show...and for the most part they didn't.

Now, I know a lot of people are ragging on the picture quality which truthfully is NOT up to crystal clarity, but even one of the executive producers of TZ wrote in to Amazon.com to explain that we're lucky to have the DVD's at all since the masters were VHS which we all know degrades with time...which is WHY DVD is so much better. Some stories/episodes don't look bad at all, but there are a few stories/episodes which are quite scratched and/or grainy. It's just a shame that CBS waited this long to release TZ on DVD.

Now, onto the content...

The majority of the stories are just as good as I remembered and hold up over twenty years. Ironically, the darker stories (and an 8 o'clock time slot) are somewhat blamed for a decline in the ratings of the show. However, it is the darker stories which always stood out in my mind and actually hold up the best: ""Gramma"", ""Examination Day"", ""The Elevator"" and ""Nightcrawlers"". But other great stories that are a little easier on the heart and soul include ""Shatterday"", ""A Little Piece And Quiet"", ""Wordplay"", ""Lost Hour Of Paladin, ""To See The Invisible Man"", ""A Matter Of Minutes"" and ""Need To Know"".

While some of the special effects don't look like they came out of JURASSIC PARK or THE MATRIX, many of the writers/producers on the various commentaries are quick to point out that they were state-of-the-art effects for the day. And it's really the story content that's the real winner here anyway. It was great thinking to make the stories as long as they needed to be instead of making them to fit commercial breaks.

Speaking of commentaries...not every segment has a commentary. However, several segments have 2 commentaries (basically the segments written by Harlan Ellison give Ellison his own commentary...and probably with good cause). While a lot of the commentaries are fairly insightful, the Harlan Ellison commentaries are priceless!!! Not only does he give great insight to his work but Mr. Ellison speaks his mind about everything and everyone...and in the most eloquent way possible. Quite delightful!!!

I highly recommend this sci-fi collection!",1111104000,49,2437,4.818181818181818

2175564,5,B00068NVLQ,"Rod Serling would have loved this series.

It takes his concept and brings it full force with such care and depth, compassion and wit, humanity, strong scripts, excellent direction, and superb actors into new realms, new hurts and hopes and victories and magic, and is as important to have as the original. Words count here. Harlan Ellison said this was a writer's series. He is right.

""One Life, Furnished in Early Poverty,"" ""Pallidan of the Lost Hour,"" ""To See the Invisible Man,"" ""A Message from Charity""--each has so much fancy and wonderful imagination in them,and such heart and delicacy, they are like precious diamonds from Tiffany's.

 For a woman to see the son she will never have, and then the boy gone for good, for a man to have a true love who is born and grows up and ages and dies in mere hours--all these things have that special Serling touch. Rare and unforgettable. Caviar for viewers who like to think and imagine and dwell in quite a splendid place.

The voice over of Harlan Ellison for ""One Life..."" is so evocative, so Twilight Zonian for him as well as for us, as he sees himself as a boy and man in the episode connotes a link, and dreamers of dreams who gave everything they had to a touchstone series. It is about life and us and I wept often as not.

It is also scary. ""Nightcrawlers"" is brilliant. As is ""A Matter of Minutes"" (the latter and the Theodore Sturgeon story it was based on were an ""inspiration"" for the last part of Stephen King's ""The Langoliers."" For the inspiration of the first part of King's ""The Langoliers,"" check out Rod's original TZ episode, ""Oddssey of Flight 33."" King has been ""inspired"" a great deal over the years. Way way too ""inspired."")

There are also funny stories. Hilarous word plays. That famous endless stop watch. Another match with the devil. And a special tribute to all those great fifties science fiction movies--endearing and wonderful--featuring excellent character actors like Jeff Morrow and John Agar and Ken Tobey, from the great movies it pays tribute to. Listen to the voice over and find all the in jokes, there are a ton of them, you may have missed. And watch out for another metor space ship landing next to the town of Matheson. Especially duck when you see those bradbury rays a'comin'.",1110153600,12,2275,4.658354114713217
2175580,5,B00068NVLQ,"I have been reading the reviews here. The bad for this set is the picture quality according to many of the reviews. But I can tell you, the picture is not that bad. Hey come on, Bruce Willis has no more hair now. People said that the picture was bad. They haven't seen the picture quality from the Sex and the City or the ST'TNG set. Those are REALLY BAD. But no, not this Twilight Zone. It is pretty good; not great but not bad either. Not everybody likes George Lucas who has that kind of resources to re-master the old stuffs to make them look brand new. But of course, I wouldn't mind to have someone who spend couple years to clean up the picture.

There is an insert in the box. The insert is pretty good. It has the brief descriptions on each of the episodes and some screenshots. This really help me to find my favorite episondes. However, there is no way to skip to the actual epsiode within the ""eqsiode"" except to use the fast forward button. If I remember correctly, the last time I have to do something like this is with  my VCR.

Sound quality is pretty good.  But again, these things are not really important. We are watching the Twilight Zone here. What we are really looking forward to is the story, and the writting, and the dialog.

The box is ok. But I really hate this kind of DVD holder. It is kind difficult to get the disc out. I have to push the button in the middle and ""force"" the disc out.  I personally like the one that you push the button in the middle and the disc just pop it right out by itself.

One more thing I like is that there is NO more of those stupid useless fancy computer animiated menu or transition thing. I hate those things. I am glad that I don't see those in this set.

So 5 stars for this TZ.",1108771200,5,1744,4.154302670623146
2175581,4,B00068NVLQ,"Let's look at this package in its entirety.

You get the full first season of ""The Twilight Zone,"" 1985 vintage, on six discs. You have to know that three shows of this type debuted in the same season: NBC's ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" ""Amazing Stories"" from Steven Speilberg, and this one. Note: you aren't seeing DVD collections of those other two.

The quality of the film to DVD transfer might suffer a bit on a plasma screen or HD quality viewer, but there is no issue with the look of the episodes presented here. They are fine and you shouldn't think otherwise.

The episodes are great to see years later, with such people as Lost's Terry O'Quinn, Without A Trace's Anthony La Paglia or Alias's Victor Garber doing roles in the anthology series very early in their careers, in addition to such heavyweights as Danny Kaye, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and a bunch more adding their star power to it.

The stories themselves are very watchable and are, for the most part, worthy of Rod Serling's vision. There are some incredible gems in the collection but there are admittedly a few clunkers in the mix as well. But you could say the same about the original series! The lesser stories here shouldn't prevent you from getting this set, because the good far outweigh the bad.

The navigation around the discs could be better. If you are just watching the eps in order, you won't notice anything. But if you want to move around, you're in trouble. You can't skip the opening title sequence of the episodes; you have to fast forward past it. And you can't skip to the various segments within any story in an episode (assuming the story takes more than one segment). That is unfortunate.

The extras should also be mentioned here. I have a problem with commentary tracks generally, in that the people involved frequently are seeing the scenes for the first time since they were made, and because of that, the comments are frequently unfocused or rambling. Unfortunately, that's something of the case here. Granted, you get Writer/Director Wes Craven, Exec Producer Phil DeGuere and a host of the creatives involved in the production of the programs. And you get commentary tracks on a surpising number of the eps.

They do provide you with some info on those audio tracks, but frequently it's more like old home week, and sometimes their talks come off like ""shoot the bull"" reunions rather than a real examination of the process or analysis of the stories.

The commentary tracks are better than nothing, but ideally, they should be separate discussions after the principals have viewed the eps. I found that tracks where it is just one commentator speaking were better because there was more focus there.

To their credit, they do give us 14 minutes of Wes Craven on camera in an office setting to talk about many aspects of the show, so that's a touch of what fans would really like and appreciate.

Overall, the project is fascinating though and is very worth adding to your collection, whether you remember it from its original broadcasts, caught it in syndicated reruns or if you've never seen it before.

2175582,4,B00068NVLQ,"When I was a kid I used to love short story series. Back in the 80s I could not get enough of Taled from the Darkside, Monsters, Alfred Hitchcock presents and, of course, Twilight Zone. This was one of my favorite shows back then and many of the stories caused such a big impression on me that I kept many moments in my head throughout the years, even if I didn't really know what the titles were or who the actors were. I remembered the secret that made people in sane (many years before knowing who William Petersen was); I remember the little boy who got killed by his creepy Gramma (no surprise to realise a few years later it was a Stephen King story); unforgettable were the man who was sentenced to invisibility, the emisary from outer space who gave the UN representatives one last chance to prove the Earth was worthy, the shocking ending of the tale about the woman who pushes the button, the couple trapped in a minute that was not ready, the flashlight falling down the elevator shaft, etc, etc, etc

When last year I found episode guides for the 80s version of the Twilight Zone I took quite a stroll down memory lane. I waited for the DVD release for months and counted each day waiting for it to be on sale. Interestingly, before that, I bought a couple of tapes, selections of Tales From the Darkside, and I must say I was a bit dissapointed. A lot of the acting, specially kids was awful; the effects were really bad and simply it wasn't as good as I remembered. I just hoped TZ was not going to be like this.

And it wasn't.

This boxed set brought back all those classical moments I mentioned before, refreshed some that were lost and introduced me to many I didn't know at all. The episodes are a great example of short story telling. The acting is really good. One of the things I like about this series is that if the story had to be short, it was. If it took 10 minutes then ten minutes it was. Or 20 or 40. There was no need to make the obligatory 22 minute episode (which would change in season 3). This series was a classic for my generation (I was born in 1975) and having it back deserves a 5 star review.

I take 1 star off though and we all know it's because of the quality issue. The first story I decided to watch when I got the boxed set was The Elevator and I remember thinking ""mmm, this is not DVD quality at all"" (which doesn't mean at all that I didn't enjoy the episode). It is not DVD quality. The image quality does have that feel of VHS tape, although in its defense I have to say it is not ""awful looking"" I didn't notice any impossible to watch scenes and even though the audio is not everything it could be, it was pretty understandable (maybe in my case the hardest to understand was The Devil's Alphabet). One thing about the audio I did NOT like at all was the commentaries, and those are just badly mixed. Usually when u get audio commentaries the other tracks are faded. That's not the case here, at least in a few I heard. The audio comentary for ""A Little Peace and Quiet"" I found particularly bad. There's a scene where Melinda Dillon is in the kitchen with all her kids yelling, and the audio commentary just becomes another voice in the crowd.

I did like the box set in itself (meaning, the design). I read a review that said the box had no episode guides but it's not true (or maybe his package did not have it). The episode guide is stored in the front flap. Full color, with short synopses of every episode. Personally I loved the design of the set.

Concerning the menu design, I must admit this is the first series I buy in DVD so I don't know what the standard is. I DID find very clear what the contents of each episode were (I read a review that said this was confusing). I have to agree that if you want to look at the credits for a particular story you do have to go to the last story in the episode and fast forward to find out. Each episode DOES include the option to watch all episodes as a 1hr show.

SPOILER ALERT ** This happened to me so I just mention it. If you've never seen the episode ""The Little People of Kellany Woods"" follow this advice, DO NOT take a peek into the special features for that episode until you do watch it. Trust me. The picture they used for the special features screen gives the ending away.

All in all I loved this set, still can't wait for the next couple of seasons. However if you are very serious about image quality and think you'll get upset if the image quality is bad, be forewarned. However, if you are like me and want to relive some classic 80s TZ episodes, or just want to enjoy some good short fiction TV, get this box set.",1108252800,8,4638,4.23868778280543
2175583,1,B00068NVLQ,"It's a shame the studios filmed this show on the cheapest film they could find. The reviewer masquerading as Alan Brenner (TZ writer/producer) said that ""the 1985-87 Twilight Zone was shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then transferred to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects--everything was done on video. (We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this.)""

Well Mr. Brennert that's all well and good but as the title of MY far more apt review says, who cares, crap is crap. That film-to-video excuse you're feeding us like candy sounds great and all, but if you ask me the truth of the matter is that all that really happened back then was that a bunch of cheap people wanted to save a few bucks on high quality film/video sources which were clearly available at the time. I mean Star Wars pre-dates this series by many years and it's loaded with special effects. So there's no real excuse for this rubbish outside of being produced by a bunch of money-grubbing cheapskates.",1107561600,5,1058,4.688172043010753
2175584,4,B00068NVLQ,"First--thanks to Alan Brennert for clarifying the technical limitations involved with bringing the series to DVD.

I found the sound & picture quality frustrating, as did some other reviewers. Hence, the 4 stars from me.  But the show itself definitely merits top credentials as a 5-star collection.

Mr. Brennert sets the record straight, as we must remember it's been an incomprehensible 20 YEARS AGO when the series was filmed...that's pretty hard to swallow, considering I remember the first Friday night I saw my first episode. That night featured ""Shatterday"" with another piece, wrapped up with ""Nightcrawlers"". I was (and still am) astonished!

The stories throughout the set are compelling, the scripts are solid (mostly), the messages carry weight and they will impact your thoughts.  Most of these espisodes are very provocative.

We have become spoiled with the clarity of today's films on DVD blowing us out of our living rooms with thunderous digital sound. So, we have to ""gear-down"" somewhat for an older presentation--but that's all right!

Enjoy the series at night with the lights out and see if you're not ""Zoned-out"" over this great compilation. And thank you, Alan Brennert for helping to craft such a stirring, intriquing, suspenseful continuation of Mr. Serling's masterpiece.

Yes, I'm a little spoiled by today's digital quality availability but I wouldn't let that stop me from viewing a truly good series and this DVD set fits that description.  I watched these shows when I was in high school and it was so wonderful to experience them again, particularly my favorites ""Her Pilgrim Soul"" and ""A Message From Charity"".

2175587,4,B00068NVLQ,"This is a terrific show definitely worth of release on DVD.  But as many have said, the video quality is very bad.  I think it is the worst that I have seen on any TV show on DVD.  However, another post on here explains the reason behind the bad quality.  I know that video doesn't hold up well (look at the original TZ episodes shot in video).  But what I do not understand is that All in the Family was shot on video and although it doesn't look great, it looks and sounds much better than this show.  Just curious about why that is.  I can take the grain and the fuzz in the video, but the biggest problem I have is that there are these ""flashes"" that happen after some scene changes (noticed it in the 2nd story of the the first episode).  It usually happens right after a scene change.  I have no idea if this is on all of them, just my set, or if it is my DVD player.

The audio is also pretty bad.  I can scarcely make out what is being said.

However, I am not whining about these problems.  I would rather have this set and all of its problems than to not have it at all.  I also appreciate the commentary tracks that are on here.  So many TV shows are being released with no extras at all (like MacGyver).",1106092800,,1215,4.046218487394958
2175588,5,B00068NVLQ,"As a long-time fan of the Twilight Zone, I have over the years recorded all three versions of the television show (not to mention owning the Laser Disc of the movie).  With the recent release of the UPN version and the rather haphazard previous Image release of the original - this is the one version I never expected to be released on DVD.  I am happy to say that it ROCKS!

As Alan Brennart (one of original producer/writers of the series) mentions, these DVDs are derived from the original CBS broadcast master tapes.  I must admit, after pulling out my tapes, these DVDs look better today than when I recorded them in 1985-86.  The DVD quality is consistent with comparable shows of the era.  A few reviewers have mentioned that some episodes are mono and some in stereo.  Well, if you look back at the time period, this was one of the first CBS shows broadcast in stereo at all.  In fact, after scanning through the opening credits of my VHS tapes, it seems that CBS didn't even start running TZ in stereo until episode 20.  That's when the superimposing of ""Broadcast In STEREO - Where Available"" over the opening credits began.  It is entirely possible that the broadcast masters, from which this set is taken, wasn't completely in stereo to begin with.  Those last five episodes on the set (and on my tapes) are in stereo so this makes logical sense.

In a time when we've all become accustomed to tv sound being primarily in stereo we sometimes forget that broadcasting stereo sound began in the mid-1980s.

Let's not quibble over the perceived lack of quality in the disc mastering (which is most probably due to the factors that have been mentioned).  We should just enjoy this rather superior incarnation of one of our favorite television shows.  For my money, just having the writer/director/producer commentaries makes this set worth owning!

Now, if they could just get ""Twilight Zone - The Movie"" out of it's limbo...",1106006400,3,1933,4.708333333333333

2175590,3,B00068NVLQ,"A lot of the defense about the visual quality states that it was because they are from 1"" video masters -- the only format remaining from that time period. That's not the biggest problem (though you will notice the odd video drop-out and such)

No, the biggest problem is the dvd mastering. Lots of artifacting, especially in dark areas and still moments.

But if, like me, you've waited 20 years to revisit these stories, it's worth suffering through. Some great stories and the a good number of weak ones. Overall a pleasurable viewing experience.

ADDED NOTE: One later reviewer wrote ""But what I do not understand is that All in the Family was shot on video and although it doesn't look great, it looks and sounds much better than this show.""

The reason is that the dvd mastering was done at a low bitrate (people who makes their own dvds will understand). On a large-screen tv you will see lots of blockiness. This is a tellatle sign of high compression or poor mastering. The quality is comparable to vcds at some points.",1105920000,9,1028,4.631868131868132

Right as the menu screen appears the thundercrack and the music come roaring on so loud it'll have you jumping out of your skin. While it only happens for a short interval when the menu screen first appears, this is the only DVD that I have to give myself special instructions on as far as the sound level is concerned.

2175592,5,B00068NVLQ,"I am just so pleased to see these episodes released to home video after all this time. At last, at last, I can retire my ancient Betamax tapings from the TV broadcasts! (Which is a piece of luck, since my Sony Betamax is fading, can't be repaired anymore, and the tapes themselves are showing their age.) I didn't  remember that this revival of the Twilight Zone franchise spanned more than one season, but I will certainly buy any followup to this release, which seems to include many of the favorites I was able to capture on tape all those years ago. (I have since been informed that ""The Toys of Caliban"", a gripping, moving classic, features on Season 2, due for release in June 2005)

Unlike later attempts to cash in on the TZ name (beware of the Canadian-produced episodes), this original sequel series holds up to the classic series, and Rod Serling would have been proud of it. There is a tremendous mix of solid scripting and careful performances from a wide range of fine writers and actors; the stories themselves range from the utterly creepy and macabre to the whimsical and fantastical -- pretty much like the original series. There's something for all tastes. And after watching the shows on the first disc alone, I am struck by how poignant many of these are; there's a sad lyricism in the best of these that is incredible for TV programming, of this or any other time.

If you are a fan of speculative short fiction, you will appreciate this set. Many thanks to the great Alan Brennert for his review clarifying the matter of picture quality for these DVDs. Brennert has long been a favorite author of mine -- his Batman stories for DC Comics in the early 1980s are among the best ever published, and I have since collected all his novels and short stories I could find. When I saw his name on this series back in its original run, I knew it would be good. Always thoughtful, powerful, quality material from him -- thanks again, Mr. Brennert, for all you've given us through the years!",1105401600,9,2004,4.576601671309192

2175594,1,B00068NVLQ,"I am writing again because I have seen a few people trying to downplay the video quality of this release (including Alan Brennert who has to be given credit for giving us these excellent additions to the Twilight Zone canon). Unfortunately, blaming the quality of the video on the original one-inch masters is disingenuous. While it is true that the show was shot on film and that the effects and editing were done on video (just like Star Trek the Next Generation in Seasons One and Two), it is not true that this is the best video quality we could have had. Image released 4 episodes per disc, with interactive menues, and multiple commentary tracks. The sheer number of episodes and special features gobbled up so much disc real estate, that there wasn't enough bit rate going towards presenting a clean image. There should have been no more than 2 (perhaps 3) episodes per disc and an extra disc for supplements.

The industry standard seems to be to put four hours of television on a disc. I have no problem with that, if you are using a high definition master for your source material. But, as Mr. Brennert admits, the source material for this show just wasn't that good, so Image should have compensated with fewer episodes per disc and optimzied the amount of disc space going to the video.

I love these episodes but still maintain that, Image could have and should have done better. I am not being picky, I just know what I am willing to pay for.",1105315200,15,1456,4.574712643678161
2175595,5,B00068NVLQ,"First, to answer the question of another review poster: the narrator of THE TWILIGHT ZONE during the 1985-1987 seasons was the great Charles Aidman, a marvelous actor whom fans of the original ZONE may recall from such episodes as ""Little Girl Lost."" (In the syndicated third season, the budget did not allow for Mr. Aidman's salary, and so the narrations were unfortunately provided by Canadian actor Robin Ward, whose performance can most charitably be described as ""ordinary."") Mr. Aidman is not mentioned in the packaging for this set, but he was, indeed, duly credited in the end titles of every episode.

Second, I'm mystified by the howls over the picture quality of this set.  It's far from perfectly pristine, but some have made it sound bad to the point of unwatchability.  That's asinine.  The DVDs in this set are at least as clear as the series itself was on its original broadcast, and those who avoid buying the set based on the whinings of an over-demanding few are really cheating themselves.  My thanks to Alan Brennert for his post clarifying the situation regarding the transfer of these wonderful shows.

Finally, kudos to Mr. Brennert, his colleagues, and Image Entertainment for bringing this series to DVD at last.  At its best, the 1980s TWILIGHT ZONE can hold its own with the finest that Rod Serling had to offer, and it is, by any standard, the finest anthology series produced in the last forty years.

This is NOT a ""bad transfer.""  The 1985-87 Twilight Zone was shot on film, but edited on video.  In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then transferred to videotape.  Editing, dubbing, special effects--everything was done on video.  (We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this.)  So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there ARE no original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer.  All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes, and the unfortunate reality is, videotape does deteriorate some over time.  Image has, in my opinion, done a superb job packaging our series, and it is to them that I award the five stars in this review!  If not for their interest in bringing this show to DVD, those one-inch masters might eventually have eroded into so much static (as my 3/4-inch tapes of the show already have).

Kris Tabori and Anne Twomey give performances of such subtlty that I find something new every time I watch this.  So often in our modern lives we get hung up in our own petty problems and get into a funk and have no idea why or how to get out.  Watching this episode of the series always breaks me out of my depression.  We have to live in the here and now and not let ourselves be stuck in the past, afraid to move forward.

2175614,3,B00068NVLQ,"After a year and a half of waiting, I finally had the opportunity to veiw CBS's The New Twilight Zone on DVD. I think the quality of it can be veiwed based on what you want to see. If you are a big Serling fan and beleive in the original Twilight Zone format, you might not find this series very appealing. It does not exactly follow all the rules the original TZ and UPN's TZ followed. For example, most TZ episodes consist of either a 30 minute episode OR a one hour episode. The lengths of the stories on each of these vary. Each episode is one hour but the stories can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as the entire hour. They also don't always have to come with both opening and closing narrations. And for the record. does anyone know who was narrating it, the narrator remained uncredited. The thing that I found most disapointing was the introduction to each episode. It doesn't really seem like the opening of a TV show at all until you hear the original do-do-do-do's of the original TZ theme.

However, if you have a free spirit in science fiction, this can easily become your favorite DVD box set. I found the writing to be exceptional. To my very pleasent surprise, a good number of the episodes were directed by Wes Craven (director of Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream,and Last House on the Left). There is also a short documentary with Wes on the final disc. The pilot stars Bruce Willis (as a man who accidently dials his home phone number and gets an answer from his alter ego) and Melinda Dillon (who digs up a small sundial in her garden that gives her the power to freeze time). The different lengths of the shories made this series unique. It was refreshing to watch short epidoes such as Examination Day, The Uncle Devil Show and Children's Zoo. The series also includes remakes of original TZ episodes like Shadow Play, Night of the Meek and Dead Man's Shoes (renamed Dead Woman's Shoes). If you have a passion for short science fiction stories, this DVD is for you. And to all fan's of the original series, I hope you aren't disapointed.",1104537600,11,2063,4.443271767810026
2175615,5,B00068NVLQ,"It is indeed rare that a remake of a classic television series could be considered a gem in my eyes, especially a remake of such a spectacular series as the original ""The Twilight Zone"". But this 1980s remake makes the grade.

The most important aspect of any great series is good writing. The original series had that. This remake also has excellent writers. I was pleasantly surprised when I began watching these stories. Right away I was taken back by how fun and original it was to watch Bruce Willis talking to himself in SHATTERDAY, Melinda Dillon yearning for silence in LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET, Robert Klein listening to his wife call lunch DINOSAUR, or Meg Foster realizing that her perfect world was just an illusion. And that's just part of the first disk.

I have to agree that I was disappointed in the quality of the shows. They are very grainy compared to what we are used to seeing on DVDs. But I can overlook that after seeing how well this remake is done. Mr. Serling himself would probably be pleased (more than he was in NIGHT GALLERY).

This DVD set is a bit pricey but the biggest disappointment would probably be the video quality as a whole. But, as I stated previously, it can be overlooked as you watch this outstanding series.

One last point is that I am a big fan of TZ. I have many books with the original short stories or original scripts. I also have a book with several of these stories from this remake. It is great fun to go back to the stories and read them after watching them on this DVD set. The producers, actors, and directors did an outstanding job staging these timeless tales of drama and suspense.

It's well worth purchasing. You can enter the zone again and know that you ARE indeed in the TWILIGHT ZONE. (Unlike the UPN version where you are somewhere, but definitely NOT in the Twilight Zone)",1104537600,11,1840,4.513513513513513
2175616,5,B00068NVLQ,"I was really excited to hear that the 1980's version of ""The Twilight Zone"" was coming to DVD. So much so that I didn't read any reviews on it but just ordered it. I remember watching the show living in Los Angeles and reading scripts for Dino DeLaurentiis. It was one of the few shows I looked forward to as a break from digging through the slush pile of movie scripts. With Harlan Ellison (a winner of numerous awards for his fantasy and criticism), Alan Brennert, Rockne O'Bannon (""Farscape""), Phil DeGuere (""Simon and Simon""), James Crocker and other outstanding writers and directors on board, how it could not be a great show?

 When I watched the first disc I thought the picture quality was acceptable but not as stellar as it could have been. As I jumped around to some of my favorite episodes I was very disappointed to see image quality that suggested it was duped from the original CBS 1 inch VHS cassettes used to broadcast the show. It turns out that the series was the first exclusively edited with effects added on video (much like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). The masters have begun to deteriorate over time so there's been some natural loss of picture quality over time. It seems Image did the best with what they had to work with (which would also explain why, for example, the soundtrack is sometimes in stereo and sometimes in mono. Evidently not all of them were presented that way although I seem to recall them all being presented in stereo).

The extras are glorious. We get numerous audio commentaries from writers Alan Brennart, Harlan Ellison, Executive Producer/director/writer Phil DeGuere, Wes Craven and many others that give insight into the production process for the new series. Ellison is both blunt with his criticism and generous with his praise for the episodes he discusses (including ""Shatterday"" which Brennart actually adapted for the show). Ellison gives a great blow-by-blow account of the difficult filming of ""Paladin of the Lost Hour"". The director did such a poor job of shooting the episode (which explains the ""Alan Smithee"" credit) that Ellison, Phil DeGuere and Story Editor/writer Rockne O'Bannon all took a crack at reediting it to make it ""work"". All the commentaries are informative but Ellison's bluntness is, as usual,refreshing.

The 15 minute interview with Wes Craven is also quite enlightening in terms of the expectations of CBS (they weren't met which is why the network cancelled the show after the second season and then farmed it out to a Canadian production company to complete the presold syndication package). The good news is that it appears that most of these episodes are uncut and as originally presented. There's also a picture gallery included.

The packaging is very good with the DVDs bound in a ""book"" style similar to ""Babylon 5"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"". There's a booklet that gives a brief plot description of each episode, the writer & director and key cast members. The booklet also mentions which ones have audio commentary. Overall, an outstanding season hampered by the poor condition of the masters, this edition of ""The Twilight Zone"" captured much of the spirit of Serling's original show with outstanding scripts by James Crocker, Harlan Ellison, Alan Brennert, Rockne O'Bannon and others. With sharp direction by Wes Craven, Martha Cooldige, Tommy Lee Wallace, B.L. Norton and William Friedkin, the ""Zone"" should have taken off. Unfortunately, the Friday time slot and decreased interest from CBS over time doomed the show.

A suggestion to Image is that on future editions to mention that these are taken from the original source tapes and that the picture has deteriorated over time. That would avoid any unrealistic expectations and allow fans of the series to pick up the show for their collection.
