8517414,2,B007I8KXV8,"It's really more of an infomercial than a show.  How many ways can you describe a 1911 pistol; well watch and be bored.  Not much information about guns, just the same guys shooting over and over....  I've not been able to finish the series (too dull), but I did get about halfway through it and no sign of the interesting revolver on the cover, really too bad.",1369180800,,361,4.358208955223881
8517415,5,B007I8KXV8,"Unfortunaly my cable does not carry the show, but as affordable as the DVD's are I just buy the a season at a time. I have all 9 seasons and the quality is HD.",1361145600,,159,3.7058823529411766
