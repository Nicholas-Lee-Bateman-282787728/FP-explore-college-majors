I originally downloaded the video and, though the workout was great, I didn't love the ""grainy"" video (compression issue). I really wanted to experience the visual beauty in addition to the workout. I spoke to Paul and he suggested that I give the DVD a shot instead. I did exactly that and there was a significant difference in the experience. These videos are awesome! I have never had so much fun riding in my basement at 5:00am.",1318896000,,529,4.578947368421052

Fun, energetic ride. Interactive and great narrative. You feel like you are right there in the middle of the action. So much fun!!

8383667,5,B002XGLX1E,The virtual reality of the ride brings you into the ride and you can forget you are not actually out on the road.  What beautiful country to see as you climb. The heads up information that is supplied on the screen keeps you honest in your effort and you can make it very real and in doing so.  I really like having the cadence on the screen.  I would highly recommend any of Paul's videos wanting a great way to workout or just get in some indoor miles.,1261872000,,454,4.136363636363637
