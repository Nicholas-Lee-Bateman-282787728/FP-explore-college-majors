8658022,4,B00KE2BWHY,"This is a very good film version of an incredibly good novel. I read the novel first. Sometimes a film is able to become its own work apart from the novel and at other times it stays within the pages of the novel. This film is in the latter category. Thus, anyone who has read the novel, will discover no added facet. You might give it the full five stars if you have never read the novel because the film will be more suspenseful and intriguing to you.

The actors all do fine jobs. I thought Lena Olin was a bit old to play the mother of such a young son but she mainly pulled off the role. The two male leads, the hypnotist and the policeman, were excellent actors.

The plot is that the policeman comes across a murdered family. He needs to find the murderer. There was one survivor within the house and he is in very serious condition. The policeman wants the psychiatrist-hypnotist to hypnotize the survivor so he has some clues leading him to the killer. The psychiatrist says hypnotism has its problems but the policeman insists. What unfolds after this hypnotism is the core of the story and the suspense of the film.

This was from the first book in a series of books about the cases of Detective Joona. So there may be more films coming.",1468540800,2,1248,4.370689655172414
