8402604,5,B003QU1J4W,"I'm a little surprised at some of the negative or so-so reviews of ""Soundtracker.""  I loved it.  I bought two more copies to give to a couple of friends who are sound engineers.  The filmmakers are objective and unblinkingly neutral in their portrayal of Gordon Hempton's eccentric, deeply sensitive, brilliant and introverted personality.  The portrait that results is poignant and vivid.  Hempton's art, innovation, and tireless work are fascinating, and this film opened to me a whole new world: of noticing natural sound, the ubiquitous intrusion of man-made sound, and the challenges of capturing this sound for use in films and other recordings.

The film also tells the story of ""One Square Inch of Silence,"" in Olympic National Park -- designated the quietest place in the United States and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and Heritage Park.  I hadn't realized until I saw ""Soundtracker"" that Gordon Hempton was the inspiration and passion behind its designation.  His work toward this cause has in turn motivated the National Park Service to put more effort into protecting natural soundscapes all over the U.S.",1471305600,,1115,5.189944134078212

8402606,3,B003QU1J4W,"I was browsing the documentary film section at my local library the other day for something good to watch, and fell upon this. Didn't know too much about the movie but I took a flyer on it anyway.

""Soundtracker: A Portrait of Gordon Hempton"" (2010 release; 82 min.) is titled very appropriately, as the film-maker visits with Hempton on a month-long trip in mostly the Northwest, and brings a protrait of Hempton. As is noted in all official releases, Hempton is an Emmy Award winning nature sound recorder (in fact at one point in the movie when filming in Hempton's office, we see the award sitting on a shelf). Once we get an understanding what Hempton does (he goes out to record the sounds of nature mostly, but also other outdoor sounds such as trains, which Hempton seems to love), the movie just follows him around, and at time nothing much happens. But then at other times, when the visuals of the movie work great, the movie does become quite compelling, almost hypnotic in a way. Lots has been said and written about Hempton himself (we see him getting visibly annoyed and outright upset when yet another plane flying over is ""ruining"" his nature recording). I couldn't help but thinking that it blows the mind that this guy has been doing this for 20+ years, you might think that at some point one would get tired of doing this, but apparently not).

In all, this is definitely not your run-of-the-mill nature documentary. Even though nature plays a big role in this, the documentary is more about the man (Gordon Hemtpon) than nature as such. I wouldn't out this on my ""must see at all costs"" list, but if you have some free time and are looking for something to watch, give this a shot.",1355443200,,1701,4.592105263157895
8402607,2,B003QU1J4W,"I have been familiar with Gordon Hempton's work for over a decade and own several of his CDs. His body of work is truly impressive, and background information about him is readily accessible on the internet. This documentary adds little to what you can learn with a simple Google search. The video itself is of mediocre to good quality. It is surprising to me how little attention seems to have been given to lighting the subject in many of the scenes; there are times that he is in harsh shadows, which does not add dramatic effect they just make him look bad. I've never met Mr. Hempton, but the video makes it seem that his face is always cherry-red, even on a properly calibrated television and cinema display. As such, I think the production quality could have been better.

The documentary consists of the production crew following Mr. Hempton as he leaves his small home to record sound in and around Washington state. There are many scenes of Mr. Hempton lamenting the diminishing natural soundscape, even one where he breaks down sobbing. I cannot tell if he was trying to make a point, but it makes him seem borderline unstable, beyond passionate for the natural environment. He comes across as eccentric, to say the least. And maybe it's the power of that type of personality that drives him to create such wonderful recordings.

There are films to buy and keep forever in your library. This isn't one of them. Wait until it comes on public television or the Documentary Channel.",1330128000,,1490,4.726923076923077
8402608,2,B003QU1J4W,"I had high hopes for this movie but was seriously disappointed:  the guy's an airhead who needs to be smacked!  (Mr. Hempton, if you're reading this:  please get in touch with me so that I might make a special trip across the country for the express purpose of smackng you!)

Mind you, I'm on his side in many ways.  I too am one of those nerds who goes about with a digital audio recorder in an attempt to capture the sounds of nature, and I have long longed for a place where it is completely quiet, so sick am I of noise.

But never in all this traipsing about do I proclaim that the trees have secret messages that can only be conveyed if there is a jet that is not flying overhead.  Hempstead's insistence on this, yet without a concomitant ability to articulate himself any further, marks him as being a crank, in my view.  As they say at Oxford, ""If they say it can't be put into words, it's not worth your time.""

The man is full of contradictions yet doesn't seem to see it, as other reviewers have noted.  You drive around in that noisy VW bus yet scorn others for using planes?  You abominate power lines yet find trains enthralling?  I am under no obligation to take your moral position seriously if it is not at least internally consistent.

Also, the guy goes around saying there are so few truly quiet places in the United States, but he's obviously not making much of an effort to get away from the road.  You could tell from many of the shots that he wasn't hiking off into the wilderness -- where he would indeed have found many spots devoid of human noise -- but instead simply parking his VW on the shoulder and wandering off only a couple hundred feet.  There seemed little effort to really penetrate the wilderness, as I have done on occasion with memorable success.

On a less relevant note, let me add that this book/movie/CD set wasn't what I thought it was at all.  See, I thought he was going around in an attempt to find the quietest places on earth, whereas really what he was after was places where one only hears sounds produced by nature, not necessarily quiet places.

My obsession, however, is quiet places -- devoid both of the sounds of nature and of man, although the place must be naturally created, not like that room in Orfield Labs in South Minneapolois.  I want quiet!  Eerie, spooky, funereal quiet!  No wind, no waves, no sound of insects -- nothing!  I have no idea where I can find such a place, but finding one is one of my life goals.",1327968000,,2482,4.373362445414847
8402609,5,B003QU1J4W,"Well, what is it like to see a movie about yourself for the first time at a film festival? Ten minutes into the film, I thought, ""This guy is crazy!"" Yet, it was me.  Undeniably me. Nick Sherman, the producer, never asked me to do anything--he is a true documentary film maker. Reminded me of someone who makes true nature documentaries with wildlife not trained animals.  He slept on the ground wherever we ground to a halt at the end of the day--sometimes with frost over his sleeping bag in the morning and without coffee or breakfast.  Yes, I have a passion for sound, most of all for the sound ""about to be heard,"" so clearly felt and imagined, but not yet real.  I feel that this movie is rare, not because of my passion--many have it--but because of the dedication that Nick Sherman showed to complete the movie on a shoestring budget and share the human spirit of compassion.  Buy this DVD and support a true filmmaker!",1317772800,4,927,4.494047619047619
8402610,3,B003QU1J4W,"This was a little bit of a let-down for a few reasons.

Firstly, the production quality is lacking in many departments and leaves the viewer wanting. This is a documentary about sound, and the audio throughout is repeatedly noisy and affected by wind; simple precautions and better mic placement would have prevented this.

Secondly the camera work is awful. The zoomy, choppy attempting to find the target shots take away from the viewing experience. In addition there is not enough material to merit the 120 minutes in length, either in exposition or narrative flow.

Overall it feels like an amateur production, and there is just no justification for that in a market saturated with quality DSLR documentaries viewable for free on Vimeo.",1316304000,,740,5.049180327868853
8402611,5,B003QU1J4W,"This documentary is basically just a cameraman following Gordon Hempton around for a month as he makes one of his periodic forays into the world to record natural sounds (a process known as ""phonography,"" the sound equivalent of photography).  The cinematographer, Martin Dicicco, does a fabulous job of capturing the majestic beauty and stillness of these places, while leaving room for Hempton to explain himself and his ""mission.""  This film must be listened to on headphones, because director Nick Sherman (with a little aid from Hempton) fills each moment with luscious binaural recordings of the sounds that drive Hempton's journey.

It is a feast for the ears and eyes.

Of course, Hempton is obsessed.  He looks up in disgust at every airplane that flies over, he talks incessantly about engine noise, he carries a dB meter with him everywhere he goes.  As in his book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Square-Inch-of-Silence-One-Man-s-Quest-to-Preserve-Quiet/dp/1416559108/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Square Inch of Silence: One Man's Quest to Preserve Quiet</a>, he comes across as a single-issue crank.  In one of the deleted scenes he is shown poring over an FAA map of plane routes, wondering aloud why air traffic isn't routed away from national parks.  Apparently it makes perfect sense to him that the air travel industry should rearrange itself so that he can make uninterrupted recordings.

His need to make recordings devoid of human noise, under often difficult conditions and against all odds, reminds me of the borderline mental illness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andy-Goldsworthy-s-Rivers-Tides/dp/B0002JL9N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides</a>&nbsp;where artwork is created to be destroyed.  Hempton is asked, at one point in the film, if his compulsive need to record was a factor in his divorce and he answers, after a long pause, ""I'm going to have to pass on that.""  He complains about being away from his kids for most of their lives, and several times he says that he'd like to give up his fruitless pursuit of silence.  Yet he is unable to quit what he calls ""his work"" and ""his job"" -- ""I am the Soundtracker,"" he repeats to himself.  ""I am the Soundtracker.""

It is a haunting portrait.",1310169600,,2348,5.671428571428572
8402612,5,B003QU1J4W,"A beautifully shot look at a very complex and passionate man and his quest to save the sounds of nature. At the very least this film should make you aware (or remind you) that we all, as a society, are constantly making trade offs in the name of convenience, profit, comfort, etc. Definitely worth a look!",1283126400,2,305,4.464285714285714
8402613,5,B003QU1J4W,"I may be biased (I directed the film) but I'm thrilled to see it on Amazon and couldn't be happier with how the DVD turned out.  I love just playing the 60 minute audio recording that comes as a special feature...it makes forget I'm stuck in the city and makes me feel like I'm out in the wilderness again, waking up early for another day of following Gordon on the road.
I think you'll like the film, too!",1280275200,7,406,4.205128205128205
