4484873,4,B004VW4VDK,"This 3 DVD set is divided up into the subjects of: Shark Island, the Great White Whales, Ocean Drifters, Jellyfish Invasion, Jewels of the Caribbean Sea and Humpbacks inside the Pod. There are no subtitles and no extras.
The colour is lovely and basic maps are shown of where the researchers are going and the history of the area. Many times the subject of some of the titled sections is not what is emphasized.
On disc 1, in Shark Island, more is told about the scientists and how they figure out how the sharks come and go from the area. We see a ballet of fish, but not really as much about sharks and also the waters and creatures surrounding them.
On disc 2 we learn about the Gulf Stream and the horrors of the effects of plastics on ocean life and of a type of jellyfish that can kill humans - its venom explodes blood cells.
Disc 3 shows coral as old as the pyramids and small fish that clean larger fish, even their gills.

All of these discs are interesting and show a variety of species and information about them and the waters surrounding them. We do see creatures being eaten by others, but there is no real gore - just life and death. Sometimes there is a repeat of some information - of the turtles hatching and drifting in the currents. There are scenes of dolphins mating and also their sexual play - which was thought to only take place in captivity when they were bored. We end with an almost intrusive picture of photographers and divers filming all of these creatures in their native habitat.
This is an instructive and beautiful set on the sea and gives information that is probably not known by most.",1319414400,15,1624,4.431438127090301
