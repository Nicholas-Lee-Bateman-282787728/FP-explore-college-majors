7476057,1,B016LR93JY,"Poltergeist meets The Exorcist with a bunch of cheap jump scares and very poor acting. Oh Holy Hell, this was bad. Poor, not well developed  and inconsistent characters, plus one of the most unlikable child characters I've ever seen. For that matter, pretty much all of them were unlikable.

The back story was too sketchy and didn't quite explain why and what was happening, the problem was that even the twist was not supported because the backstory was not complete enough.",1457049600,5,476,4.864197530864198

7476060,3,B016LR93JY,"Carrie (Kerry Knuppe) was raised Catholic and carries that with her even to her mother's (Heather Langenkamp) new house, a house she shares with her partner Samantha (Samantha Mumba) and daughter Tia (Alessandra Shelby Farmer). To Carrie's dismay, Samantha and Tia are atheists and her mother honors their wishes by not praying at the table. There is an instant rift between Carrie and the world she lives in. Oh yes the house they live in is haunted by an old man (Oto Brezina) who collected Victorian pictures of dead people and the proverbial creepy wooden puppets.

The film is rather bland up until the last 20 minutes or so. The twist, while not totally unexpected, was not the ending I would have done. We are then shown a mess-o-flashbacks so we can see all the clues we missed and the cleverness of Frank Lin.

No swearing sex or nudity.

Note to self: Do not use on-line exorcisms.

Frank Lin (director, script writer) does faith based films, and I imagine this is supposed to be a horror film suitable for the faithful. Frank claims in his film description Carrie is a fundamentalist, but clearly he made her a deeply religious Catholic who tolerates her mother being a lesbian. The names of the characters are about the same as those who played the roles, hence the faux paus of having ""Carrie"" (Kerry) in a non-Carrie film.",1455494400,19,1336,4.696581196581197
7476061,1,B016LR93JY,"It looked familiar when It started but I couldn't remember the ending. Now I know why. I quit watching the first time. When the characters are so disagreeable it's hard to care what happens. The two mothers were so intolerable. One could not stand thT her stepdaughter was religious and said grace. The real mother was trying to appease her wife, forgetting that her daughter was raised to get dressed for dinner and said grace. From there on in, it went downhill. I skipped through most of it to see the ending. Not badbut not watching the movie.",1503446400,,547,4.591836734693878

It doesn't qualify as a ""Christian""  Movie or a ""Scary"" movie.  It is soooo boring and goes no where, slooowwwly... ZZZZZZ

To summarize: For every cigarette you smoke, it takes one minute from your life.  I would have rather smoked an entire pack of cigarettes than waste the precious moments of my life...ON THIS MOVIE! (And I don't even smoke)

7476065,2,B016LR93JY,"I can often find things to appreciate even in those awful cheesy horror movies, and I went into this one with very low expectations. The actors were fine. The story was okay-ish. The writing... and character direction??? OMG kill me.

A. My kid is my kid - I wanted to punch Heather when she was trying to make excuses to placate her wife. What the f--- ever. If you're with me, you're with my kid and you will not expect me to treat yours better than my own. That and the fact that the little one was a TERROR - just ended up hating the moms. Got better when they went away.
B. The focus on the 'omg, you're lesbians' moment was dumbly awkward. Like really, was this supposed to be set in the 50s?
C. Not quite sure where the writers grew up and their life experiences, but in general, most people I know that live in an 'alternative' lifestyle that appreciate acceptance and tolerance are not typically so intolerant and unaccepting of a person's choices, be it relationship or religion. As long as the person isn't oppressing them, do what you do for you. This was jarringly unrealistic.
D. Again, not sure the writer's experiences - but the religious daughter... I'm all for freedom of choice and not following blindly - but she was an odd mix of uber christian and not. Curls up with her bible when frightened, but then as soon as the bf is there its wine and making out that would have gone further? Just seemed inconsistent to me.
E. I also agree with another reviewer - the little girl just did not give off the creep vibe. She looked sleepy. Jodelle Ferland - while in danger of being typecast as the creepy little girl forever - had that role down pat.

Not a lot of scare, some jump moments I guess. Some effects were bad, sure. It felt like there was story missing actually... that would have better rounded out some of the emptiness. Or they'd pretty much had two stories and couldn't commit and tried to blend them together - other reviewers are right - its like they started off with the house/ghost thing and then the end was part of a different story.

One thing I DID appreciate... main girl's hair was jacked after all the drama and demon action. Most real moment in the movie. Toss it on in the background while you're doing something else, didn't feel like I wasted all that much time. Got some quests done and lunch eaten with it on. :)",1499558400,2,2358,4.4036697247706424

7476075,2,B016LR93JY,"SPOILER  ALERT

Carrie is a religious freak, but she doesn't have a problem with premarital making out,
which would have continued to premarital sex if Tia had not interrupted them.

I enjoyed this movie up until the point when it suddenly changed from interesting and creepy to just stupid and ridiculous.
This movie started out as a drama, with a backstory about Carrie's father moving to India, etc., but then the plot just changed,
and suddenly the story changed to a silly teen horror movie.

So, Tia died at the school playground, but her ghost came home anyway.  The Tia Ghost was so real that Carrie and the lesbians and the boyfriend couldn't tell that she was a ghost.  But the teacher couldn't see the Tia Ghost at all.  The Tia Ghost was so real that she could pee on the floor and Carrie could put her into pajamas and tuck her into bed.

The only parts that made a little bit of sense was that
the Tia Ghost didn't eat the peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
and she said that she could never go to school again and never leave the house,
and when Carrie tried to drag her out of the house, she couldn't pull her out.

Ghosts can't eat, but they can fall asleep, and pee, and they can even have their temperatures taken.

The scene where the teacher tells Samantha that he cannot take a child from school was very clever.
When the movie was over, I rewinded to that part.

I expected the boyfriend to die, and it was surprising that he just left the house with only a bloody nose.

What was the point of making the lesbians a bi-racial couple?
Was it because they wanted to hire Heather Langenkamp and Samantha Mumba, who happened to be different colors,
or did they actually plan to cast actresses of different colors?

So, did the Tia Ghost destroy the house at the end, or was it the ghost of the old man with the dummy-doll?
Or was it both of them?

The last minute was obviously supposed to be scary, but it was just stupid and ridiculous.",1495843200,,1956,4.382271468144045

7476085,3,B016LR93JY,"Most of this movie is a study of Obama's dream for America, a mixed race child with lesbian parents. The Liberal dynamics are explored in depth including the atheism and anti-Christian stance of the Left. So, all well and good if that's what floats your boat. This is about 90% of the movie with a couple of noises and doors slamming thrown in, but nothing overly dramatic. I don't care about the modern family dynamic but it does ignore some well founded principles of the genre, a main one is: the absolute best creepy kids are pale brunette girls (see pic for example). Don't know why, its just the way it is. This girl couldn't pull it off, she just didn't feel right in the role and as she is central to it that's a major problem. The acting is good, the camera work is good, the unnecessary lesson in modern social dynamics is largely irrelevant BUT the fact that nothing happens until 5 minutes from the end is going to be a hurdle for most people.

The concept is that of every other horror movie: a family moves in to a new, 'haunted' house. The family has some minor issues. The spirit or whatever it is claims a child as its own.
What really rustled my jimmies was the holes in the plot. The first third of the film is focused on this creepy-ass doll that one of the main characters is obsessed with. But it seems to make sense because it belonged to the ex-owner of the house, who is supposedly performing the hauntings.
However, at the end (SPOILER ALERT), we find out that this main character has actually been dead for half the movie, and *she's* the one causing chaos in the house. I just... What?

I couldn't make it very far into the movie.

You have pretty much every modern day trope imaginable. The super christian, the pervy neighbor, the lesbian couple, the innocent kid, and these sort of all form the basis for the entire thing.

7476167,2,B016LR93JY,"I'll give the filmmakers this: they brought spirit to their effort. And they carried the whole thing off with dignity, avoiding the all too common impulse to embarrass themselves, the crew, and the cast, as so many crappy movies do. Unfortunately, it's a clumsy film. It's agonizingly slow for all but the last 20 minutes.

Part of the problem is the abject lack of humour of any kind. It's all so deadpan and colourless. Think of Poltergeist and how intermittently funny that film was, amid all the shocks and frights. I kept waiting for someone to tell a joke or laugh at the ordinary absurdities of suburban family existence. Even the smiling, charming boyfriend of the oldest daughter couldn't shine any light on this dour affair.

Frank Lin (director) did some interesting things with sound, which I wish they'd carried even further. Movies like The Haunting or The Changeling used sound to chilling effect. Home squandered the opportunity to make more of its small budget by raising the hairs on our necks with the suggestion of things unseen.

By the time the final 20 minutes rolled around -- and the pace picked up -- it felt forced and, again, awkward, almost out of place after such a sloooow first and second act. By the time we got to the twist, I simply rolled my eyes. It just didn't work. Twists require a clever setup and a believable sequence of ""of course!"" moments peppered through the film. Home arguably has all those moments, but adding them up results in less than the sum of their parts.

Disappointing, mostly because I could see talent at work (more behind the camera than in front of it) and hoped for something a bit richer. I probably won't remember this movie come the weekend.",1480118400,,1708,4.702341137123746

I DONT KNOW.

Listen. They heard a noise in the kids room and didn't want to wake her up to investigate. So they BANGEDTHROUGHTHEHEATINGDUCTS because that was a lot more subtle and less likely to disturb a sleeping child than CRACKING THE DOOR.

Kinda sorta coherent, esp. considering what is presented as ""The Church"" nowadays, and if you don't assume what the ""bad guy"" is.

Pretty believable, typical, mostly clueless, conservative post Vatican 2 girl in way over her head, like the ""DIY exorcism"", which her 'pastors' likely wouldn't perform, esp. ""on the spot"", and either don't believe in or would find otherwise offensive regardless. Still believable. Sage? Really?

The really scary part is when one of the characters has her clothes changed back 'inexplicably'. ""Spooky"".

Not bad. Some ""light"" taking God's name in vain, which is apologized for. No nudity. Some ""shenanigans"" that, while not Catholic, is believable. No other bad language recalled.",1470096000,,738,5.391304347826087

Didn't care for the ending at all. Kerry Knuppe really reminds me of Rachel McAdams.

The movie made more sense after that. I love b movies, well most of them and this one was well thought out and the characters were great.

Seeing the cover of the movie I thought it was going to be all about some scary stuff throughout the movie. I mean come on, look at that picture. That being said its just a story that leads up to the last of the movie with some really creepy stuff and an aha moment.

7476367,3,B016LR93JY,"I was reeled in by the end of the movie. It gets a solid 3.

There's a bit of God vs No-God family conflict and it desperately clings to stereotypes... the good little Christian girl with her skirt, sweater, and cross necklace vs. the godless lesbians who hate prayer. Frankly all of the first half of the movie is clumsy and clunky. It's all a rather terrible setup for the last half, which is decent. No gore beyond some bloody hand prints -- the first set looks like a mix of dried ketchup and a little bit of red corn syrup. Oh yeah, there's a bloody nose too (I don't know what they used for this; at first the ""blood"" doesn't even stick to the guy's skin) and some bloody carpet that also isn't convincing.

Overall, worth the watch if you have time to kill. The movie leaves a lot to be desired (the first parts could have been better and the main part of the movie before the ""twist"" is just dropped and forgotten), but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. If you don't care about terrible plot development, you can skip up to the part where a chick with a braid and a guy are sitting together with a grassy background.

Spoiler --

As with many B movies, the cover gives away the ending. If you haven't gotten the hint by the time someone says, ""Why do you hate me? Why don't you want me here,"" you're probably not paying attention (which... after the first half, nobody could blame you).

I give this movie an extra half point for the terribly awkward scene where an art teacher tries to hit on a woman, finds out she's a married lesbian, and calls them both unicorns. That was as excruciating to watch as I'm sure it was to try to act through!",1466035200,,1669,4.252365930599369

The crafting of the story's development within the scenes of the film had a few intentional bit where the viewer is led to believe that the house's previous occupant along with the doll were the cause of all the craziness within the house. When Tia is understood to be brought home by the school faculty member, one is led to believe that all is as it should be. At the film's end, it only becomes clear that Tia is seeking revenge against Carrie and her not arriving in time to take her home after her school dismissed the students. It really becomes clear is more concerned about her religious belief in spite of the feelings of others who might find it offensive.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home/dp/B01C6D0RUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home</a>",1462924800,2,810,5.3858267716535435

7476432,2,B016LR93JY,"As a horror movie, this wasn't too bad. There were quite a few ""jump out at you"" scenes that even made me jump, and I typically do not even flinch at horror movies. There were a few parallels to ""the Exorcist"" but it was unique enough to hold it's own and I never saw the ending coming.

So why two-stars? I am tired of propaganda being disguised as entertainment. If you happen to be a Christian, you will be offended by this movie from the get-go. In today's society, we are told that ""tolerance"" is the word-of-the-day. So here you have a Christian girl described in the description as a ""religious fundamentalist"" - someone with ""... [an] unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs"" - even though this girl never says one disparaging word against her lesbian mother and her interracial wife - a practice that is against the Christian faith. So the description itself tells us that this is a propaganda piece against Christianity.

Now, even though the theme of this movie is possible demonic possession and exorcism - a uniquely religious concept since there can be no demons without a God - when the Christian girl wants to pray at the dinner table, the mother's wife gets upset and later tells her partner that she does not want that in her home. She sarcastically says that she guesses everyone should be uncomfortable just so long as Carrie (the Christian) is comfortable. Later, when Carrie is singing the Lord's Prayer, the other little girl in the film tells Carrie point blank ""you shouldn't pray in front of people who don't believe in God."" When Carrie and her boyfriend attempt an ""Church sanctioned exorcism"" that they somehow found online (yeah, right) the boyfriend flippantly referred to wine as ""Jesus juice."" These are just a few of the obvious and blatant attacks on Christianity.

I guess tolerance only works one way - Christian's must tolerate and accept behavior and lifestyles contrary to the teachings of the Church, while the rest of the world is free to criticize and belittle the Christian faith at will.",1462924800,2,2046,4.7740112994350286

Also, why have the creepy puppet and the guy? I guess to throw us off. This was slightly disappointing.

To start he seems to have deliberately made every character grossly unlikeable.  The over zealous atheist lesbian who discusses lack of acceptance while failing to accept her step-daughter's quick prayer at dinner.  The Catholic daughter who appears bitchy and self-absorbed, seemingly devout who later chugs wine and nearly has sex on the sofa. Oh and let's not forget the pervy Art teacher who repeatedly seems all too pleased with seeing two girls together.  Then SEVERAL MISSTEPS that reflect poor writing and HORRIBLE editing.  First, the lesbian couple leaves the night after moving in to go to a meeting for which they have to take a plane. They leave at 5 pm and are back the next morning? If you had to take a plane to get there, when exactly is the meeting? Just illogical. The WORST EDITING FAUX PAS I HAVE EVER SEEN! The young step sister to the 21 year old Catholic girl comes downstairs and urinates on the floor. Then we see her being tucked into bed with yellow pajamas on.

Just the situations. As slow and tense as it was, I finished the movie. Ok, without giving away the movie, I liked it a lot. It's smart and the ending has a great Sixth Sense twist. Makes you think. It's worth a rental.",1458345600,3,389,4.27027027027027
7476456,2,B016LR93JY,"Not worth 5 bucks, this should have been free. Seems like all the 4 and 5 star reviews are from the movie makers themselves.

7476460,4,B016LR93JY,"When I heard this film starred, Heather Langenkamp, I immediately wanted to see it. I've been a fan of hers ever since I saw her in ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" I'm also a big fan of horror movies that don't employ gore and torture to get the scares. I was just as interested in the subplot of the family's issues as I was about the haunting aspect of the movie. There are also some comic moments when their next door neighbor drops in. There are definitely some haunting images that last with you even after the movie is done. The characters are all interesting to watch and there are a lot of red herrings that throw you off course.  I did not expect that ending! As a scary movie afficionado, I did enjoy the film.",1458000000,7,715,4.296296296296297

7476464,2,B016LR93JY,"So disappointed, wish I could get my money back. Not much of a plot, and the ending made no sense.  The beginning of the movie looked as if it were being made with a hand-held camera;  lighting was off, picture quality was horrible with weak dialogue throughout.  Actors made a brave attempt, but were stuck with the lousy script so can't blame them at all.  The best thing about this movie?  The marketing poster, and that's about it.  They got me.  Well, my $5.  Blah.",1457827200,2,470,4.447058823529412

This isn't a slasher flick or a torture-porn movie, but a good ol' fashion horror movie with strong characters and a creepy tone. Once you ease into the story, it builds to a truly satisfying climax that had me shocked in the end.

I highly recommend.",1457222400,6,429,4.631578947368421

8736770,1,B016LR93JY,"Weird Christian movie, using Catholic phrases to ward off ghosts, then they suddenly go back in time and kill the little girl for some reason. Totally weird, and not in a good way. Three attempts at a jump scare using video-game-style special effects. Whatever story this movie was based on isn't what I'd call horror. I'd call it a Crappypasta. If you're into watching 20-somethings pray endlessly and attempt to have sex on the sofa while a ghost kid in a schoolgirl skirt pees on the floor (tired old copy of an Exorcist scene), then go for it.
The little girl who plays Tia has pretty hair. That's the only good thing I can say about this movie.
By the way, the picture of the rotting girl in the movie art? You only see her for the last half-second of the movie. The rest is praying. Seriously.",1531267200,,799,4.442176870748299
8736771,4,B016LR93JY,"There are a number of good things about this movie. First, there is enough character development that you are interested in what they will do/what will happen to them. The setting is simple but effective. The back story is also simple so they don't have to belabor it like so many ""suspenseful"" movies of today. The acting is pretty good. The special effects aren't great but they are not bad, as in so many. The main problem with the movie is that the ending (the very end of it) really does not make sense/fit with all that comes before.",1528070400,,539,4.454545454545454
