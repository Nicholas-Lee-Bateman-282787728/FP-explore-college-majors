7957930,4,B000062XJ5,"I enjoyed learning the moves and steps as a grown up, thinking I would teach these moves to children I work with. The only warning I offer for having a child use the video to learn, is the constant left/right cues while the instructor is not a mirror to the viewer, which may be confusing for children... and was for me at first. Otherwise very fun and playful, and somewhat retro since it felt very 80's to me, which I liked.  :-)",1338854400,2,431,4.2560975609756095
7957931,4,B000062XJ5,This video is fun for kids of all ages.  It teaches the hula dance movements for two complete songs.  It was worth the money.,1245283200,2,125,4.166666666666667

7957933,5,B000062XJ5,"I found Leina'ala Kuloloio to be a very warm kumu hula (instructor) whose heart really seems to be with the kids!  She is a very graceful dancer.. fun, knowledgeable & enjoyable to watch.  She has a wonderful warm up at the beginning of her video ~ which includes a couple Hawaiian words (other than the hula words for the basic hawaiian dance steps) which makes you really feel like you're there with her.  Her video also has little clips of her girls between dances having so much fun with the costuming, and of them dancing the Hukilau and Pearly Shells at the end.. this is one video I highly recommend for anyone wanting to learn the hula !!!",1051660800,14,647,4.466101694915254
