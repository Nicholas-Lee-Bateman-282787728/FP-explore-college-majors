8097913,4,B000CDHMMO,"I like martial arts and gangster movies since I was young. I came across Ashes to Ashes and gave it a try because it was shot in England and I liked the DVD cover.

This movie is about a guy named Gabriel who is writing a story titled Ashes to Ashes. He gets mixed up with a girl who is trying to escape from a bad relationship with a mafia boss and ends up having to fight for his life. Its your typical gangster martial arts story full of cliches, bad language and over the top acting.

It is low budget with unknown actors, but the action is good especially stick fight and nunchuk. I also liked the music a lot. It was really good for this type movie and worked well. This is not a new movie and you can see this by the clothes and mobile phones. It was made in the 90s but parodies 70s movies.

I enjoyed the movie. I didn't think it took itself seriously and it made me laugh out loud especially at over the top gangster Nelson and a really embarrassing love scene with the gigolo. This kind movies are not known for having great actors or amazing stories so I wasn't expecting the Godfather. My favourite scenes were when Mohammed spoke to his family on an old mobile phone and when the mafia gangsters threatened Arabella. I think the dialogue was best in those scenes. The end fight was over the top hilarious. I hadnt heard of anyone involved with Ashes to Ashes, but it was better than I expected and I enjoyed it for what it is",1417651200,,1439,4.206521739130435
8097914,2,B000CDHMMO,"This doesnt seem to be well made first and foremost. IT looks like the filming was done by maybe a ""troupe"" of college actors, with a couple hundred dollar camera. This is not like a John Cqarpenter where he could turn the cheep actors and cheep cameras and make a masterpiece. This was written and was acted by and edited by the same guy. It looks like he was being too serious? or not serious enough? either way I couldn't get into it and felt that he wasn't very good. His face when doing numchucks was hysterical, it looked like he practiced with that same face everyday all the time and took hiself way too serio8usly. There was about 5 minutes overall of martial arts, which is horrific for a martial arts movie. I've seen movies not intending to be action movies have more martial arts in them than this. The majority of the plot seemed missing, just a wanker walking around talking to people, saying how cool he was and acting tough. Really it was total balls. It didn't make ant sense, never explained who the characters were and where they came from and why they were doing whatever it was they did. I definately feel like this was a waste of every penny I put into it as well as any money anyone else paid for this movie to get made. I would say that 99% of movies I have seen I enjoy, or atleast didn't mind watching. This one was one of the toughest to get through, and the acting with the horroible directing and production qulity made it very difficult. Tell me why this movie was good other people that reviewed it, because I can't find it. I did enjoy the music, it was the best part of the whole fil. It was cheesy, unmasrtered and overall slightluy harsh, but I enjoyed the music, so I gave it a star for music. Everything else just is a bomb. It looks like a group of college students attempted, and quite poorly I'll say, to make a film with the lowest budget possible. This shows. Also, the guy who wrote it either thinks himslef a genious and put himself in every scene, or didn't realize what a horrible pile of crap was being created and just went with it. I would have been better throwing darts a wall of words to come up with a story that made more sense. Also, the fact that only main chracters are ever shown, and theres no background ro secondary charcters. This definately gave the feeling of just four or five people in the entire film. Not very good, don't waste $15 on this becasue it is definately not worth $15. Also note, that this is not a US release movie. The other reviews are lies. This is made and released in the UK. It is PAL format, and cannot be watched on American DVD players. I had to pull out my computer and plug it into HDMI and that was a hastle. Everythnig basically in the description and other reviews is a lie NOT A MARTIAL ARTS FILM. NOT AN AMERCIAN RELEASE. NOT ENTERTAINING. NOT ENJOYABLE. LOW QUALITY. LOW BUDGET. WASTE OF MONEY. POORLY WRITTEN AND ACTING EVEN WORSE. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND MONEY AND DON'T WATCH UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE DISSAPOINTED.",1382400000,,3015,4.357015985790409
8097915,5,B000CDHMMO,"I'm a fan of rare, obscure action movies. I first came across the trailer for Ashes to Ashes a few years back. From time to time I'd visit the Red Moon website with the hope that news of a US release would be announced. Now, finally it's out on DVD and I have to say it was well worth the wait!

One thing the trailer didn't prepare me for, was the sharp dialogue this movie delivers. In fact, the only time the dialogue loses its edge is when any of the characters are being nice, which isn't very often.

Unlike most movies in this genre, Ashes to Ashes has several unpredictable sub-plots and an interesting mix of dreams and reality making it the type of movie you'd like to see over and over again. It has all the makings of a cult classic: outrageous characters, brilliant music, dark humor, colorful language and a lot of action and suspense.

Featuring brutal street fighting (not your Chinese opera dancing) and set in England, this is a very unusual movie! You'll either love it or hate it. I loved it and so did my buddies!",1144540800,4,1034,4.375
8097916,5,B000CDHMMO,"This film has everything. Fantastic fight scenes, great performances and a real sense of simmering menace throughout. I was on the edge of my seat as the central character (Gabriel) navigates his way through a deadly world populated by some of the coolest and most threatening characters to be found in any film. Who is Wayne Gerard Trotman?? He has written, directed, edited and scored this film by himself!  Not to mention stealing just about every scene he's in (I haven't seen anyone wield nun-chucks like that since Bruce Lee in Enter The Dragon). I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an action packed no holds barred experience. It may also prove to be a collectors item of the future.",1133308800,2,711,4.780487804878049
