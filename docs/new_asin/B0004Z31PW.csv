2156730,5,B0004Z31PW,"Amazing quality for film taken more than 60 years ago. At first, you may think,you are watching a Hollywood movie before you realize that this was the real thing. Highly recommend for everyone but especially for history buffs.",1364515200,,226,4.973684210526316
2156731,5,B0004Z31PW,"Excellent documentary shot by the world's best combat photogrpher.  The son narrates and understands what his father went through, landing on D-Day and following the troops through VE day.  It's his coverage of the death camps that makes this important for others to undeerstand just how evil the Nazis were and just how willing the German nation was to help serve their master for a healthy economy.",1323561600,,400,4.955223880597015
2156732,4,B0004Z31PW,"As a WWII history buff, the movie provided a cameraman's perspective not usually considered for the time and it was in color which was a bonus.",1270598400,,143,4.538461538461538
2156733,4,B0004Z31PW,"This is the film done by the film maker from hollywood who followed General Patton during War world II, I bought this DVD because My dad had the VHS. My dad was in the resistance and then went to the D_Day at St mere L'Eglise and then went to Omaha beach and joint the US army as the French division, helping the americans going through France, Germany, and to do the junction with the Russian. It is one of the best documentary done in colors.
Until George Steven Junior short the film of 16min. and cut the signing with the russians in Tungao sur Elbe. I was very disappointed because in theses 16min missing my dad was in it.... Why cutting a wonderful documentary, that his dad did,
risking is live to show to the world what's happened and make sure people will remember. I was thinking of having a memory for me and my children of what their grandpa accomplished. And here go, cut probably for the cost of the product or for greed... The film is very great film, hard to see sometime for certain child or adult, but reel because you see death and the camps.
Since my dad past away.
What did George Stevens Senior is a masterpiece, what did his son is making money.... sad",1255564800,,1176,4.35
2156734,5,B0004Z31PW,"Director, producer George Stevens spent the war years in uniform. Along with a number of veteran Hollywood cameramen and screenwriters they formed a film unit dedicated to recording the events transpiring in Europe in 1944 and 45. Narrated by his son, we follow ""The Stevens Irregulars"",as they called themselves, from the landing on Normandy to the Allied Forces trek across enemy territory to Berlin. We see the liberation of Paris and the discovery of the camps at Aushwitz to the fortress in the Alps where Hitler spent much of his time. What is remarkable is that these movies were shot in color. To view the D-Day landings in technicolor makes that events so real, we are not watching grainy black and white film, we are seeing it as it was seen by those who were there those fateful and historic days.. I was stunned seeing them for the first time. It is a time capsule like no other.",1132531200,6,891,4.6455696202531644
2156735,2,B0004Z31PW,"Adding color film like these to the grainy black-and-white images that have become the public memory of World War II is illuminating. These are original color films, not colorized black and white films. The war in color is how people who were there saw and lived the war.

Yet the color footage is mostly of the photographers themselves, the ones who spent 99% of their time shooting the black-and-white footage we often remember or that serves as our memories of the war. There is some shocking footage of dead bodies, Dachau, and destruction. There is even more footage of mundane scenes of jeeps, soldiers, scenery, cities, and ceremonial meeting sin Paris and on the Elbe. And there are plenty of shots of the film crew shaving, eating, meeting dignitaries, opening Christmas presents, and looking like a bunch of buddies on a fishing trip. The narrator explains who the men were and what they did later, making them - not he soldiers -- the feature players of the story. These home movies at times separate us from the war and the men who fought the war. This dilutes the power of the message and of the memory.

This is a nice way to revive memories and to honor the service of the men who defeated the Nazis. But this DVD is short, superficial, overhyped, and oversold.",1127520000,7,1276,4.666666666666667
2156736,5,B0004Z31PW,"Dear Mr. Peter Lorenzi,

I must disagree with you completely,  As a photography/film student, I viewed this film in part and soon realized that this film was not tinted with any type sepia-acetone color of any form.  These motion pictures were shot directly from Kodak color film in ""home movie cameras"" that were brought along with the regular potion picture industry equipment that was used mostly for black and white shots.  But this documentory was shot with real Kodak Technicolor: Called ""IB Technicolor"" for Imbibition. The most fade resistant color process. Found in 16mm from the mid 1940's to the early 1970's.

At the start of World War II, famed Hollywood director George Stevens (Woman of the Year, A Place in the Sun, Shane), like several of his film-world cohorts, volunteered for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, whose assignment was to document the front lines of the war as it happened. Their footage accounts for the many famous black-and-white newsreels that were the public's only moving-image link to what was going on in the war. But Stevens also brought along his home movie camera and shot color film at the same time, capturing many images both informative and horrific, that he shelved away until his death. George Stevens Jr. inherited a treasure trove of film lore, and assembled this footage to show to the public for the first time in this documentary.

George Stevens: D-Day to Berlin is really an astonishing collection of personalized movies. We've seen much of this before: D-Day in Normandy, the liberation of Paris, the discovery of the horrors of the concentration camp in Dachau. But being used to seeing these images in gritty black-and-white, it is almost alarming to see it in full, vibrant color. These films aren't washed out, and they certainly aren't sepia-toned. They are brightly colored as though they could happen today.

One should do their home-work before commenting on something in public.",1121558400,5,1983,5.042813455657492

The scenes of devastation take on a deeper meaning, when they are viewed in color.  More recent conflicts have been filmed in color, but to this viewer, WW2 was a defining moment in world history.  It deserved to be shot in color.  One gets a better understanding of what the countryside really looked like in color.  In my view, this dvd is well worth buying, for the color shots alone.

I worked for Department of the Army for over 20 years typing and proofreading stories from WWII written for student texts for the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.  I was so awed by the DVD, especially seeing General Patton smiling and in color, that I loaned my library copy to my neighbor, a young Army major.
