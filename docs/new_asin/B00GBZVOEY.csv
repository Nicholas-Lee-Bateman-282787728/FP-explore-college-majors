6070081,4,B00GBZVOEY,"But how great is that? Brain power is required to get the most out of this. Lot's of coincidences, but that's ok. Because there is great acting here. And a terrifying, hope-this-never happens to me and mine reaction. Heartbreak on the screen. And monsters. That look like us. It is very good at what it wants to do. Finally a movie for the mature of all ages. No explosions. How refreshing.",1379635200,,390,4.507042253521127
6070082,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a wrenching plot because we don't know WHO to suspect. We share the anguish of the parents whose daughters have gone missing and the woman whose nephew is suspected of taking them. At one point I thought I had seen so many MacGuffins I could open a shop, but then, Lo and Behold, each of those little devices became big ones, so pay attention!

With a script by Aaron Guzikowski (""Contraband"") and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies""), we are wrung out by the frantic action and the heartfelt misery that unfolds before our unwilling eyes. The most outstanding feature is authenticity: The family interactions and the locations. I would have changed some of the dialogue and completely eliminated one ""Gotcha"" moment.

Here is the sterling cast:
  * Hugh Jackman (""Wolverine"") is Keller Dover, a building contractor who lives with his wife and two children in a pleasant middle-class neighborhood. It is his frantic quest to find his daughter that is central to the plot. He says, ""Pray for the best, prepare for the worst.""
  * Maria Bello (""The Company Men"") is Keller's wife, Grace. As one empty day follows another, she begins to lose hope.
  * Jake Gyllenhaal (""Source Code"") is Detective Loki, a weary, relentless investigator who hasn't lost a case yet. The girls' parents are frustrated by his unhurried pace.
  * Viola Davis (""The Help"") is Nancy Birch, mother of the second missing girl. She has to examine her own principles and humanity when confronted by the evidence.
  * Terrance Howard (""Red Tails"") is her husband Franklin, Keller's unwilling collaborator.
  * Melissa Leo (""The Fighter"") is Holly Jones, a resourceful widow who has raised her mentally impaired nephew.
  * Paul Dano (""Ruby Sparks"") is her nephew Alex. He has the mental age of a ten year old.

Three things I should mention: 1) This takes place in a chilly, damp locale; take a sweater. 2) This runs 153 minutes; limit your liquids. 3) This is an R-rated thriller; expect explosive action and a LOT of profanity.

The DVD will have captions, which I sorely needed a few times. I've already asked Amazon to notify me when it is available.",1379376000,93,2145,4.846153846153846

6070099,3,B00GBZVOEY,"It seems Denis Villeneuve is pretty self-impressed and has a tendency to make movies much too long and fills them with a lot of non-essential long shots. Ive recently seen four of his movies and really only liked one Sicario. I did Blade Runner 2049 the night before and it suffered from the same ills of this one in that it lacked a story that could support the length of the film. This one was boring enough in many spots that I had to do an Internet search on plot points I missed while actually watching the movie. There just isn't enough happening in this movie to warrant a runtime of 2 hours, 33 minutes and its stuck in a confining small town with few characters and no one is really doing much to keep the viewer entertained. There is a lot of footage that would have been much better left on the cutting room floor and more focus on some of the plot points.",1522627200,,867,4.260606060606061

6070130,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Maybe I wasn't in the right mood this time, but the first time I saw Prisoners I liked it just a tad more. Hugh Jackman plays a Dad trying desperately to find his disappeared daughter, and Jake Gyllenhaal the seasoned detective trying to actually solve the crime without punching said Dad in the face. The good?  The story and script ask real moral question about who is the criminal, and who is the prisoner. The Bad? Jackman's character is a bit more over the top than I would have liked - his hysterical brow-beating of Gyllenhaal's detective is not quite authentic enough. So, when the worm turns (no spoilers here) I'm not sure he has really earned it, and Gyllenhaal's character is just a bit too unfazed by everything. Nonetheless, these are really more quibbles. Overall, Prisoners delivers the goods, and the real scene stealers in the film are Paul Dano's remarkable turn as the suspected kidnapper and even more so Melissa Leo's truly eeirie performance as ""Ma.""",1512950400,,973,4.791666666666667

6070136,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This film is absolutely incredible. Most newer movies I have seen are quite terrible, but this movie shatters any and all low expectations. This is a slow burning thriller centered around the emotional abduction of two children. Prisoners is a mysterious puzzle in which the pieces do not fit together until the very end. The cast of characters was well picked. I would like to mention that if you have ever seen The Lovely Bones, this movie is the oppisite end. It focuses on the misery of the parents and the hell on Earth they go through while trying to find their children. In content, it is in juxtaposition of The Lovely Bones. There is nothing fluffy or whimsical about Prisoners. It is very sad, very real, and jarring.",1510876800,,727,4.6434108527131785

Use the old adage - If you've  seen one  - you've seen them all and you'll be in good company. The acting was more than satisfactorily enjoyable - just the results where (or seemed to be)  to predictable. Low - to medium dose of language in the F*** word category mixed with a fair dose of blood and guts; and you've got the aforementioned plot carried out to a tee. For a $5 movie its okay - any thing more than that - then you would probably be just as well off looking for a good Marvel Comic's based flick. JMHO.",1508976000,,743,4.323741007194244

6070163,1,B00GBZVOEY,"SPOILER ALERT
The film is way too long, a lot of unnecessary shots, no real emotion on Hugh Jackman's part and one of the most significant fatal flaws in my mind  absolutely no humour, not a pinch. It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.
Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was ""bragging""  so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail
Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail
The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance  by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila!  A clue again! Fail

Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the mentally disabled Alex  when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable  when the plot requires  to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the disabled guy but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point  the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2  get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well  why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail

Everybody seem to be talking in riddles  the girl that escaped utters ""you were there"", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail
Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather)  very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail
The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice  open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice  are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail
Oh, and a note to the director  try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors  may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.",1497657600,2,3372,4.554635761589404

The title, we think, applies to all the situations and characters, who are trapped in situations they cannot escape.  Calendar holidays rule our lives.  Bad bosses rule our jobs.  Various marriages.  Children.  Mental states.  The clues mainly relate to the facts revealed in the plot, like in any standard mystery, but they are satisfyingly easy to miss.  Thank God for cult religions and other types, ruling our thoughts and actions, but often sinned against.  Wow, what a movie!  Must see again and show to family and friends.  Not for kids.  Ultra violent, which fits the story well.  Almost up to the Mulholland Drive top complexity movie.  Not a fantasy like MD but otherwise perfect.",1478304000,3,752,4.959677419354839

Prisoners draws you in, spins you around, then puts you in a moment of suspended disbelief, leaving you simply with...wow.

All around an excellent movie. Great plot, great twists, and a great cast led by none other than the best actor of all time - Jake G. You could cut a diamond with the stare that he directed at Paul Dano in the police department at the start of the movie. He's almost like Medusa in the sense that you'd need a mirror to look him in the eyes when he stares at you in order to avoid serious bodily harm.

I could go on for awhile raving about this movie, but I'll spare you the torture. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a DVD player and two hours to kill. It's a must!!!",1457654400,,768,3.9483870967741934

The acting is fantastic, particularly by Jake Gyllenhaal, who manages to show so much about his character and add so much depth without there being a whole lot of dialogue for support. The general premise is great for a thriller and I wasn't quite sure ""whodunit"" until I'd gotten well into the film.

It is a crime drama-thriller, emotional roller-coaster of a film.  Hugh Jackman, and Jake I can't spell his last name are at their very best.  I was glued to the screen.  The end was very sad or was it?  SPOILER ALERT!  The detective kept looking at that car (Camaro was it?).  But even if they discovered the pit underneath,  I'm afraid it was too late.

6070451,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie has been sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. I received it as a gift for Christmas given my love of of the film's leading men, unfortunately it seemed like every time I sat down to watch it something would come up. Today I was finally successful. It was a great movie, though one that I'm in no hurry to watch again. Run time clocks in at just a little over two and a half hours. I personally like longer films, provided the material is there. A longer run time can give a director time to expand the story, flesh out the characters and the world. But on the flip side, if the material is lacking, it creates a sluggish pace for the viewer.

Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his family are attending Thanksgiving dinner with Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his family. Both families have two children, a teenager and young daughter. Despite the friendship between the families, there are some clear class and character differences. Over the course of the day the younger daughters, Anna and Joy, go missing. The search to find the girls and how far a parent will go become the driving plot of the film. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. While he assures Keller that he is doing everything that he can and that he will find the girls, this seems to go in one ear and out the other. Loki has no children of his own, he's younger than Keller, and from a parent's standpoint it seems like he could be trying just a bit harder to solve the case. It's easy to see and feel Keller's frustration with the situation, which is why it's of no surprise that he takes matters into his own hands. Using the decrepit apartment building, his deceased father left him, Keller takes Alex (Paul Dano), the only suspect as far as he's concerned, and holds him hostage. In this situation he tortures Alex for information about his daughter as well as the Birch daughter. Unfortunately, Alex has the mental capacity of a ten year old which means it gets ugly. As the movie progresses and the story lines begin to intersect, it becomes a question of just how far down the rabbit hole the whole thing will go. The material is reminiscent of something one might see on Criminal Minds, however there's no real profiling of the kidnapper. And some viewers may find the motive to a be a bit disappointing.

The plot is captivating and convincing. The viewer wants to know how it all ends. Are the girls found? Are they alive? Did Alex take them? And how far will Keller go to find his daughter? I assure you the title of the film is no coincidence. While on the surface it would appear that the title refers to the missing girls, each of the characters becomes a prisoner in their own way. The story and setting remind us that these things happen every day. They could happen in our very town, no matter how sleepy and picturesque it might be. Perhaps it's that sense of realism about the film that makes it so good.

I do have a few complaints about the film, though they are not enough to really detract from my overall impression. The male characters are more fleshed out than the female characters. Viola Davis (Nancy Birch), Maria Bello (Grace Dover), and Melissa Leo (Holly Jones) all feel like secondary characters. There's no real room for character growth for any of them. We get one scene each to sum up the character's emotions and state of mind. Despite the fact that these characters are all affected by the disappearance of Anna and Joy, they receive relatively no airtime. The film also has a bit of an ambiguous ending, where the viewer must decide for themselves how it truly ends. That's not to say the central plot isn't resolved by the time the credits roll, it is. But don't expect everything to be wrapped up in a neat little bow. That's not real life and the film is a startling reminder of that.

All in all, I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars. If you're a fan of the crime/thriller/mystery type genre, it's a great film. Good script, solid performances by the characters throughout. Definitely worth checking out.",1442707200,,4052,4.516348773841962

Because of the poor presentation (title, cover) I passed over this film dozens of times until a friend (whose taste I share) recommended it very highly, mainly for the outstanding performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jackman (Paul Dano is pretty phenomenal in his role as well)...  After seeing it, I couldn't agree more.  Good solid kidnapping mystery- a bit slow & drawn, perhaps, but if that's your cup of tea, this shouldn't disappoint...  But really, this movie is about the performances-  These two hold Nothing Back in their performances here-  Possibly the best I've ever seen Jackman!

Why was a certain character included and who was he really, why did the guilty person do what they did, why why why? Also it drags, I can honestly say they could have put all that happened into a movie an hour shorter and it may have worked a bit better, but still would have left those threads hanging. HJ and JG are just fine in their characters, but even having said that, they are a bit empty, and you will find yourself asking more questions about them, why they are that way etc Could have been a really good movie, but instead is one that dragged in parts and confused in others, won't be high on my list to watch again.",1432857600,,809,4.294117647058823

It's bad enough when you see something a trained detective should see, but to watch him ""accidentally"" figure it out was just absolutely embarrassing.  I was embarrassed for the entire cast. This movie was a complete waste of time.

Watching the detective rush to the hospital causing mass mayhem because turning the siren on was beyond his comprehension was ridiculous,  seeing him rush out of his squad car trying to get the attention of the medical staff made me just ask ""gee if only squad cars had some sort of device in their car that let people (like emergency room doctors) know they were on the way, Like I don't know a fricken radio?",1427673600,,806,4.702127659574468

6070563,5,B00GBZVOEY,"What can I say - this movie is a winner!  Hugh Jackman's acting is outstanding.  I was unsure about Jake Gyllenhaal before this movie and because of this movie I have decided I like him - he is a good actor.  And Paul Dano does a great job of acting.  The movie takes you on a roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end and what an ending it truly has.

6070566,1,B00GBZVOEY,"I don't have much to add to the other negative reviews of this steaming pant-load, except to ask what significance the name ""Loki"" had for the Jake Gyllenhall character.  He's called ""Detective Loki,"" but we never learn if it's his first or last name, or if he has only one name, like ""Prince.""  Also, Loki is the Norse god of evil - how does that make sense?  It would have made more sense if they'd called him ""Baldur"" the god of light, or even ""Hodur"" the blind god since he couldn't find his way or something.

Otherwise, at least an hour of this film should have ended up on the cutting room floor, and the remainder would have had more plot holes than a Sierpinski gasket.  I can only recommend this to diehard fans of Jake Gyllenhall, or anyone who enjoys seeing Huge Ackman screaming in rage, and especially anyone who despises Paul Dano and wants to see him suffer.",1423958400,6,874,4.4375

6070587,4,B00GBZVOEY,"On the surface, this looks like a bog standard police procedural thriller; children go missing, one obvious suspect, insufficient evidence, angry father, blah, blah, blah. In a lot of respects it is just what it seems but it still delivers tension, action and twists while refusing to conform to the much overused formula.

The atmosphere is splendidly bleak thanks to the grim Pennsylvanian November weather while the washed-out, nearly monochrome colour palette lends yet further grimness (its no wonder it earned an Oscar nomination for best cinematography). Couple this with cracking performances from Jackman & Gyllenhaal , magnificently managed tension from start to finish by a little known director, refreshingly anti -Catholic overtones and plenty of did-he-didnt-he plot twists you have the recipe for a sure-fire winner. It almost manages it too, but for the seemingly rushed ending and myriad loose-ends flapping about. The eventual unveiling of the culprit should have come as a surprise but, unfortunately, weve watched far too many dramas in this genre so we had sort-of worked out the connections long before the somewhat slow witted Gyllenhaal.

The ending could, of course, be deliberately Cohenesquely enigmatic, preferring to leave the viewer to fill in the gaps rather than providing a neat CSI-style i-dotting & t-crossing instantly forgettable ending but a bit of tidying-up would have been nice. Also, there are a good number of quiet and/or mumbling dialogue moments which require either a rewind or having the volume uncomfortable high.

I think I can mostly forgive the movies relatively minor failings though; it is an unusually dark, suspenseful, claustrophobic thriller, crammed with atmosphere and superb performances.",1421539200,,1749,5.470370370370371

The picture is very clear, colors were accurate. The writing and directing were very excellent. The running time is a bit long, running 153 minutes, or 2 hours and 33 minutes long.

Hugh Jackman (as the father) and Jake Gyllenhahl as the dogged, flawed police investigator turn in career defining performances in what is a stark and mostly fast paced thriller with plenty of plot twists, turns, and a few surprises along the way.  With a dark and damp environment of grey skies, monsoon rains, and slick, snow-covered roads, Prisoners delivers a riveting and thoroughly believable portrait of mental illness (both temporary and transient) and the unique law enforcement individuals charged with hunting down criminals.

Rated a ""Hard R"" in my opinion for scenes of (implied and real) brutality and torture, with coarse language throughout.  Could have been edited down 10 minutes or so but this is a minor complaint.  Brilliant film.",1419292800,,929,5.335616438356165

6070639,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners Review
 A truly good film must have two distinct qualities; an intriguing story and well-acted, interesting characters. The movie Prisoners came into theaters on September 20, 2013. The alluring story puts the audience on the edge of their seats while the superb acting married with a grim tone places them in an agonizing situation where the lines of good and evil are blurred. Prisoners exhibited brilliant performances from Hugh Jackman as a father willing to do whatever it takes to save his daughter, and Jake Gyllenhaal as the determined detective assigned to the complex case.
 Prisoners is a suspenseful drama that focuses on two families whose daughters are abducted in broad daylight on Thanksgiving day. Detective Loki, the police officer in charge of the case, quickly takes Alex Jones, who had been seen in the neighborhood that day, into custody. However, the man is soon released because of a lack of substantial evidence and the fact that he has the IQ of a ten year old. Immediately the audience is conflicted by this because Alex does seem to be innocent of the crime itself but also seems to know something. Keller Dover, the father of one of the stolen children, then takes matters into his own hands by abducting Alex and torturing him for information on the whereabouts of the girls. Here are where the lines first begin to blur, while you sympathize with Keller because of the disappearance of his daughter, you know that what he is doing is wrong. The audience sees a harsh contrast from the Keller we were introduced to at the beginning of the film and his descent into darkness. Meanwhile, Loki suspects a new man of abducting the children when he exhibits suspicious behavior at a candlelight vigil that is held for the girls. When the detective tracks the man down he finds boxes of bloody clothes, snakes, and mazes written along all of the walls in the house. The same type of maze had been found on the pendant of a murder victim located in the basement of a priest. During the mans interrogation Loki assaults him as his frustration explodes, further muddying the line between right and wrong. As detective Loki gets closer to putting all the clues together, Keller starts doubting that Alex really did take the girls. At this point the plot boils to a head to create a tension-filled and ambiguous ending that leaves the audience wanting more. While the overall plots of kidnapping and revenge aren't wholly original as Hughes points out, it is the way that the story is paired with a theme of conflict that makes the plot so intriguing.
The theme of conflict, which is intricately placed throughout the plot, would not have had the same effect that it does in Prisoners without the help of the brutal performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.  It was his portrayal of this stubborn father that brought home the emotion and struggle of the character in these tough scenes that Schembri mentioned. This is especially evident in the torture scenes with Alex where Jackman manages to gain some sympathy from the audience, even while he is committing this heinous act. However, even Jackman did not overshadow Gyllenhaals biting performance as detective Loki. Throughout the film Loki has a distinct eye twitch which Gyllenhaal added. This twitch gave the character a sense of tense frustration which swells throughout the story. As Lokis frustration rises so does the tension the audience experiences, this is a credit to Gyllenhaals performance. Though both characters act in ways we might not, these actors were able to bring an understanding to their roles that made the audience battle with themselves and their feelings throughout the film.
Ultimately, Prisoners is a slow-building thriller that deals with a conflict between right and wrong through its gripping story fueled by enthralling performances. This film puts you in a place you would rather not be in while still managing to make you feel for the corrupt characters you are with throughout the movie. Prisoners, while everyone may not enjoy it, is sure to make its mark on cinema.",1414627200,,4094,4.913294797687861

In addition to the direction, performances, music - all superb - the understated religious themes are profound; what a well-written original screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is something of a dark angel, with his mysterious tattoos, his twitching eyes (which pay off later during the film's climax), while Keller Dover (Jackman) is the man of original sin, his evil elicited by the kidnapping of his daughter. ""I'm here to do my penance,"" Dover says in one scene near the end. And penance he does. While ""Prisoners"" is a noir-ish crime thriller and detective mystery, it shimmers with mysticism, a film at once rooted in humanity and elevated by something transcendent.",1409788800,,803,5.184615384615385

6070680,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I am in my early 60s.
This film was Brutal. I knew from the opening scene (hunting) that there would be a classic ""hunter becomes the hunted"" theme.
In this case, it was so complex with many twists & turns. You'd think (after ""Wolverine"" & ""Les Miserables"") that Jackman's character would be the hero but he turned into a crazed man. Yes, desperation to find one's missing daughter would lead a person to do things out of the ordinary but I had to fast fwd through the repeated scenes of Keller Dover torturing mentally slow Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano, who did a great job in ""There Will Be Blood"" & ""The Ballad of Jack & Rose""). That was absolutely too much violence for me. It helped that Franklyn Birch (Terrence Howard) felt bad about the brutalization & kept telling Keller to stop. But those scenes were far to horrific. And somehow, you know Alex didn't kidnap the little girls.
Melissa Leo (""Frozen River"" & ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"") is one of my all-time favorite actresses & she did a strong turn here. But her cold, cruel, souless character turned my stomach.
Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as Det. Loki, who never gives up despite his endless frustration & all the obstacles in the investigation. He portrays a real person, not a 2 dimensional detective. I worked for the Boulder Police Dept/Detective Unit as a Gal Friday during one of the most horrific child murders of all time. I went on stake-outs, guarded the little boy's mother & stood as they dug the boy up. So I know how real detectives truly get involved emotionally, especially in child kidnapping/murder cases. Gyllenhaal was the hero of this story.
I love Maria Bello (""The Dark"") & was angry when her TV show was cancelled. They didn't even give it a chance. She does a great job of showing the grief, the need to huddle in a dark room after her daughter goes missing.
The very end is unresolved. That left me frustrated. I am assuming that Loki finds the missing person (not going to spoil that one) but it was not shown. I much prefer resolved issues, even though I know from my own experience working in a Detective Unit, that some crimes are never solved.

The case was shrink wrapped rather than sealed in film, which was suspicious.
I open the shrink wrap and the sticker sealing the opening of the case is partially torn, as if someone was trying to get it open before.
An area near the opening was cracked, further showing that someone had tried to open it, but couldn't, and I was about to find out why.
I try to open it myself and see that it is still sealed by the sticker (or so I thought), turns out the plastic from the Blu Ray case sealed just barely where the security sticker is usually put, so, I tried using a razor to open it and finally got it pried open, but not after putting even more cracks in the case.

The movie also ties the various red herrings together in a way that is all just too coincidental.  Again, I know it's a movie but I felt I was really stretching my suspension of disbelief.

It wasn't until one hour, 45 minutes that the pace picked up to the point of being riveting.  Don't get me wrong, the first portion was interesting, it just wasn't riveting.

The several twists in the movie made it hard to guess correctly.  A few more clues were played out and one might get something and feel as though they had it.  Alas, a few more clues were given and the thought that caused the initial guess was out the window.  Acting, especially by Jackman and Gyllenhaal was great.  Gyllenhaal's detective character was played as being obsessed, not because of his perfect rate of clearance, but because it bothered him NOT to have answers.

I would suggest watching this movie in two parts.  Watch the first 1:45 and then walk away for a day.  The 15 minutes between 1:30 and 1:45 made the difference in whether you might return to the movie or not.  It was worth those 15 minutes!",1405814400,,1003,4.480662983425415

6070725,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I watched Prisoners for the first time this past weekend and was immediately wrapped up in the story. While the film is dark, brutal, and unpleasant, it is also entirely engaging.

As a distraught father whose daughter has been kidnapped, and finding little resolution via legal means, Hugh Jackman gives what may well be the performance of his career. He's an actor that is so closely entwined with the X-Men character, Wolverine, that I often forget just how solid of an actor he really his. Here, his talent is on full display as a man on the edge, pushed to the emotional brink. Gyllenhaal is solid, too, as the lead investigator, capturing the weary reality of his profession.

There's a lot of questionable morality at play here, and it's a bit too easy to root for Jackman's character, even he has he goes too far and does too many questionable things. Great, great movie, though. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and there's some really masterful layers and twists to the story. Every little scene plays fully into the overarching story, and the plot itself is almost as labyrinthine as the maze-like puzzles one character is obsessed with. Prisoners is a slow-boil of a film, but nothing gets wasted and there is no fat to trim, story-wise. Tonally, it reminds me a bit of David Fincher's ZODIAC, which is also highly recommended (and another deliberately paced crime flick with Gyllenhaal front and center). I'll be adding this film to my buy list for sure!",1404691200,,1469,4.712062256809339

6070730,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a dark, dark, dark movie, every bit as tense and disturbing as I been led to believe it would be. Like most good mysteries, there are a few red herrings along the way but the reveal of the kidnapper's identity and connection to the other characters makes sense contextually -- you can re-watch the movie and see where the hints were dropped, and they do all line up.  One of my biggest complaints with mysteries, whether written or filmed, is when the writers/directors are so interested in being surprising/shocking with their twist endings that they don't play fair with the audience. (IMHO, the only time that's okay is in a canonical Sherlock Holmes story, and even then it's frustrating.)

Performance-wise, I don't think there's a missed opportunity or poor performance in the lot.

Hugh Jackman takes Keller Dover from God-fearing, stand-up family man to some very very dark places ... without spoiling anything other than what the movie's trailers did, he morphs from distraught father to angry detective to a man who sees no other option but to continue on the path he's on, even if that path ends his life and damns his soul. The movie opens with Jackman reciting The Lord's Prayer, so we know he's a religious man; he recites it while watching his teenage son shoot and kill his first deer, so we know he's also a practical man who wants his family to have every chance to survive anything that might happen (the basement is stocked to survive a massive power failure, for example).  Near the movie's end, he recites it again, and the difference in intonation and pacing shows us just how far Keller has descended.

Jaky Gyllenhal's character is saddled with the unfortunate name of Detective David Loki. I say ""unfortunate"" only because, hearing the character's name in the trailers, I assumed he'd be far more of a trickster character than he turns out to be. He does his best to investigate the girls' disappearance, and he does put some connections together than none of the other policemen (what few we see), but he doesn't seem to be very tricksterish.  Overall, I liked Gyllenhal's performance as much as Jackman's, except for the facial tic he displays.

I will agree with others who have said that Terrence Howard and Voila Davis are a bit under-used, but the same can be said of Maria Bello. Once the situation is introduced and Keller starts down his dark path, the other three parents become increasingly less important to moving the plot forward. Each one does have at least one powerhouse scene that plays to their strengths.  In fact, so does Dylan Minnette, the only one of the four Dover and Birch kids to get significant screen time. Over the past few years, directors have really started to notice Minnette's intensity and he's getting larger and stronger roles. His scenes in Prisoners with Jackman run from a son who idolizes his father to one who cannot contain the betrayal and anguish he feels at what he perceives to be his father's failing.  He's a teen to watch.

The other stand-out performance is from Paul Dano, who is virtually unrecognizable as Alex Jones. It's not just the make-up (stringy hair, slightly overweight padding, thick glasses), it's the performance. He's so invested in the character there isn't a glimmer of Dano present.  Melissa Leo is also wonderful as Alex's aunt Holly.",1404086400,,3341,4.81326352530541

6070743,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, whose daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) goes missing on a rainy Thanksgiving Day, together with his best friend Franklins (Terrence Howard) daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Although a suspect is soon apprehended, the police have to release him, having no conclusive evidence.

While the police detective David Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) continues to investigate, Keller, unsatisfied with the way the police handle with the case, attempts to find the missing daughters on his own. This means the father is determined to do whatever it takes to save his daughter's life  even breaking laws.

Those who have seen the Canadian directors previous work Incendies (nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2011) know that his Hollywood debut is nothing ordinary. Not many thrillers run 153 minutes these days, do they?

As a thriller Prisoner really requires suspending disbelief, as some parts are too good to be true, but thanks to the powerhouse acting from the entire cast and the brooding photography of Roger Deakins, the film is an emotionally charged, morally complicated drama.",1401840000,,1130,5.331460674157303

Its one of those ""edge of your sofa, totally engaging, nail-biter""...Hugh Jackman and Jake G. are phenomenal.
The two young male actors playing the creeps are really convincing at their roles, and Maria Bello has proven once more that she
is a talented drama actress.

The movies is basically about two acquainted families living in the suburbs, whose young daughters get kidnapped during one Thanksgiving dinner.  The father of one of the daughters begins a frantic search for his daughter, hence getting into conflict with the police, specifically with the detective leading the case.  As the investigation and search continues, days go by, and strange events begin to unfold...some twists and turns on the way, with a killer ending will want to make you watch this film again.",1401408000,2,888,5.110344827586207

6070752,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is a prime example of why I will never understand Hollywood. You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before it was even released, yet for some reason they had to make it nearly three hours long. If there was enough story for a three hour film, then I'd be all for it, but Prisoners has a good 45 minutes worth of repetitiveness, that does nothing to help the movie, in fact, it takes something away from the film. The story begins on Thanksgiving, when two little girls go outside to play and disappear. Feeling that the police aren't doing enough to find the kids, one father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Hugh Jackman stars in a role I wouldn't have imagined him playing in a million years. Based on his other roles and what I know about the man, this doesn't even seem like the kind of role he'd be interested in, but he gives one of the strongest performances I've seen all year, I really didn't know he had that in him. Jackman is paired by Jake Gyllenhaal, another guy who I couldn't see playing a tough as nails police detective, but he too surprised, giving a very strong performance. The cast isn't the problem and the story isn't the problem, what bothered me about this film was how much of it was unnecessary. Did we really need dozens of scenes with Jackman and Dano or all the talk and sadness amongst the families? This was a great all-around movie, but it was so long, that by the end, I'd stopped caring about what was happening and just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film for a unique twist on classic story, great performances from an unlikely cast, and the work of a Director who his known around the world for his signature style, but just a word of caution. Prisoners is a very long film, that at many points seems to go around in circles. When they eventually do get to the point, it's outstanding, but it takes a while to get there.",1401062400,,2052,4.431216931216931
6070753,3,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie has a familiar plot of two little girls who have gone missing and the subsequent search for them and the suspects.  I am a fan of crime dramas and with this type of plot I'm always hoping for something different and surprising.  Unfortunately, although the movie throws in a couple of twists in an attempt to mislead the viewer, I thought the ultimate outcome was predictable and similar to movies/TV shows I've seen in the past.

The movie has a big name cast and I felt that Jake Gyllenhaal (as Detective Loki) was very edgy and the most  interesting.  Paul Dano (the prime suspect) and Melissa Leo (the suspect's aunt) were very good.  Hugh Jackman (as Keller Dover, one of the missing girl's father) had the lead role in the movie and I was not overly impressed by his acting.  He was basically a vigilante type father and I didn't like his character and didn't sympathize with his plight.

The length of the movie (at 2 hours 33 minutes) was overly long.  It seemed to me that High Jackman was given a lot of screen time to vent his anger at the detective and prime suspect.  *Possible Spoiler Alert Follows*.  The filmmakers must have thought that Jackman's  kidnapping and torture of the prime suspect was a highlight of the film and warranted more screen time.  I thought it was pretty repulsive and backfired as it made me dislike his character more (almost but not quite as much as the child abductor).",1400976000,2,1423,4.5770750988142295

6070764,5,B00GBZVOEY,"It could be at least 4 different people depending how you want to work with the definition of ""prisoner!""  The angry father feels imprisoned as does his family since they can't find their missing daughter, the missing daughter could be interpreted as a prisoner, the cop would fit the bill as well since he's on the case but getting nowhere most of the time... even the bad guys!  Yes, ""Prisoners"" is an interesting title for the movie.

Anyway without a DOUBT the number one reason Prisoners is such a great film is due to the extraordinary acting of Hugh Jackman.  When I say he's awesome in his role as the parent who desperately wants to find his missing daughter, I wasn't expecting him to basically turn into a possessed monster!  He will do absolutely *anything* to find her and can be deliberate, intense, angry, vengeful... you name it!  I knew Hugh Jackson was a fantastic actor- I think most of us knew that already going into Prisoners, but I guess I either had a lapse of judgment and forgot or just didn't realize how powerful he can be in the roles he plays, especially given the very frightening and realistic material he has to work with here.

Hugh Jackson is so believable in his role that he should be winning best actor of the year for a role this good.  Maybe I just got caught up in the mystery and the suspense of the film so much that I'm simply blinded with bias so I apologize if it sounds like I'm exaggerating a bit, but he deserves *some* kind of accolade for his role.  Let's get to the movie instead of all this Hugh Jackman gushing shall we? :)

I don't want to spoil what happens for a good chunk of the film but I might have to since not mentioning it is almost unavoidable.  This is a minor spoiler however, this next part.  Hugh finds and captures a mentally disturbed man who has the mindset of a 10-year old.  Hugh believes this man is responsible for the kidnapping of not only his daughter, but his friends daughter as well.  Hugh even hears the man singing a song that his daughter was singing the day she disappeared, sending distinct warning signs that he's the guilty one.  Hugh basically kidnaps and tortures the man, and keeps the body hidden in an old rundown and abandoned apartment building.  When Hugh's done torturing for the day, he returns the next day and keeps going without remorse.  Don't try to reason with Hugh either- he already thought the situation out clearly and won't let a simple disagreement that what he's doing is wrong stop him from processing with the torturing.  Basically Hugh's absolutely crazy in the head and proves he's willing to do anything to find his daughter.  He takes it to a whole new level!

However the other major chunk of storytelling is about the cop (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who ALMOST ruins the movie in my opinion due to his poor acting, nonchalant attitude, total disinterest in doing his job and finding the two daughters, feeling inconvenienced whenever Hugh Jackman expresses rage and accuses him of not trying hard enough (which is correct, the cop's NOT trying hard enough to find the two daughters- at least for a while).  Now some of this can be attributed to the storytelling- the writers wanted a laidback and lazy cop to search for clues in this small town.  However some of it is completely unintentional.  Jake just doesn't possess the right kind of emotions depending on the situation at hand.  He often comes across more like a rookie unaware how to react in certain situations.  Not sure if intentional or not.  I think someone else should have played the cop role instead.

This movie even shows the mother/wife of Hugh Jackman, and how distraught and unable she is to cope with the disappearance of her daughter in believable fashion so she stays in bed depressed all the time.  While a good chunk of this movie is slow-moving, mystery-related drama, there's clearly *another* chunk of the writing that is suspenseful concerning how Hugh Jackman responds to the man he captures.  This is a mighty fine movie regardless of Jake Gyllenhaal almost dragging it down.  The only problem is the end of the film.  It doesn't provide the kind of closure that it clearly COULD have.  The movie needs at least one more minute to wrap everything up.  I mean they were *so* close!  Just one more minute would have done it!  Anyway the final 20 minutes are downright AWESOME despite the ending.  Several twists and turns.  Great great movie.",1400112000,,4442,4.627075351213282

6070767,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I thought a lot of this movie was wasted on the aspect of misleading the audience so that we believed it was always the other guy, or that guy, the movie had a lot of making people point fingers at each other.

On another lighter note, the movie was not as gruesome as I thought it would be. The gruesome scenes are short and too the point, however they are pretty terrible while you're watching. So don't feel bad if you have to hide your eyes for a few minutes, believe me the dialogue will help you know what is going on, even if you're not looking.

While I did enjoy this move, I found it to be a little over-analytical for my taste. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes, I would especially those with children. I think its important to know how far you would go for your child. Though for most the answer is easy, all the way. For Hugh Jackman, the answer is the same.",1399939200,,879,4.1647058823529415

It was a slow start, slow getting to the midpoint, slow to reach the climax and an even slower resolution. It leaves you, sort of, holding your breath and never really provides the sigh of relief. If you have the time and patience for a seemingly never-ending movie you may find yourself really enjoying the story though.

Everything is done well.  The acting is perfect.  The character actions are realistic, believable, and enthralling.  The story just keeps piling on tension and mystery, making you wonder how facets fit together until the very end.

Very disturbing.  Very creative.  With an excellent ending and a few nice twists.

Sometimes, extreme measures are the right measures.  Especially when dealing with these types of criminals.  You will get a satisfying dose of violence--unfortunately tempered by the realities of our justice system and the ingenuity of evil human beings.

Hugh Jackman portrays one of the girls' fathers, who snaps and kidnaps a released suspect and tortures him.

6070804,3,B00GBZVOEY,"I really looked forward to seeing this film having heard good things about it and loved the actors involved.  It started interestingly enough with a father and son hunt on Thanksgiving morning then things turn dark.  The cast is strong, but I believed underused.  There was no attempt to develop chemistry between the characters and I didn't once believe that Viola Davis and Terrance Howard were a couple.  Jake G. and Hugh J. benefit from their screen time and give strong performances.  Ultimately, it's Melissa Leo's quiet, steady performance I found the strongest.  Leo is a great actress.

As a thriller, I recommend this movie.  I think folks may find it a bit slow as we have become accustomed to cookie cutter thrillers where the who, what, where and how is telegraphed or answered quickly.  Prisoners takes an all too familiar story and through it's characters gives us something different.

6070815,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Every so often I see a movie that I can't get out of my head; a movie so fascinating, compelling and intricate and I can think of nothing else for days afterward. Prisoners is one such film. The movie focuses on two families whose daughters disappear on Thanksgiving day, and the subsequent search for them. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the father of one of the little girls, takes matters into his own hands when the police fail to make any progress in the search. He becomes more and more rash and irrational, his methods more and more extreme. This is not Taken with Liam Neeson. This is a man who prepares for every situation and disaster, and loses it when he's faced with a crisis he never thought to prepare for. Hugh Jackman's Keller is frantic, angry and above all, desperate. His is a loud, red hot, full blooded performance that fully conveys the sense of anguish, rage, and fear that someone in his position would endure. The film asks the audience to consider how far is too far when it comes to your children's well-being. What would you do? Jake Gyllenhaal, in an interesting turn, plays the detective assigned to the case. Where Jackman's performance is showy (in a good way), Gyllenhaal turns in a layered, subtly nuanced performance. He is the long-suffering force that everyone in the film turns to for help, as well as to lay blame. But my favorite part of the movie is the cinematography. Its gorgeous. Every frame of the film is considered and precise. It is one of the most well filmed movies I've ever seen. It looks incredible on bluray, and I sometimes put the film in just to see some of the beautiful photography in it.

With intricate and engaging writing, intentional editing, arresting cinematography and powerful performances, I can't for the life of me figure out how this film flew under the radar this Oscar season. But either way, this is a thrilling and powerful piece of cinema. It has its issues, mostly concerning some possible plotholes and a line or two of only passable dialogue, but the film is so engrossing that they are easy to overlook, and even easier to forgive. At the end of the day, this is a layered and intense near- masterpiece. Oscar worthy (not sure how much of a complement that is anymore) direction, performances and cinematography in one of the very best films of 2013.",1397606400,,2331,4.657766990291262

6070825,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Young parents Keller and Grace Dover walk over to the suburban home of Franklin and Nancy Birch in the November cold for a Thanksgiving Dinner involving neighbours, laughter and bad trumpet playing (Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Terence Howard and Viola Davis). Their respective daughters of 7 and 6 Anna and Eliza happily play upstairs with a pet while the adults below drink and reminisce. That is until both children go outside to play - and unaccompanied - addle up to the back of a muddied RV parked suspiciously by the kerb in broad daylight...

Although I thoroughly despise material that uses children being hurt as entertainment - ""Prisoners"" beats the pants off so many supposed thrillers because it reeks of intelligence (a fantastic and clever script) and has a cast that emotionally rivets you to the screen every second they're up there. It's also prepared to be silent - ordinary even - thereby making some scenes disturbingly close to how real life actually is. It's unnerving, creepy and stomach churning in places too (there are monsters out there).

In order for this to work you need major league actors - and lots of them - and right down to a repentant Paedophile Priest - even the small parts are perfectly cast. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover - a redecorator/builder and a 'prepare for the worst' deer-shooting survivalist - while his wife Grace believes she'll and her family will be 'safe' with him. Mild-mannered neighbours and friends Franklin and Nancy Birch have the opposite dynamic - the wife is the boss while her husband is more reflective.  But when a local simpleton Alex Jones is found singing in the front seat of the squalid RV and arrested but won't talk - both sets of parents have their patience and nerves tested. Frustrated by the cops lack of progress and working to the letter of the law - and with the days passing and time running out for their abducted daughters - Alpha Male Keller decides to take matters into his own hands...

Into this emotional cauldron comes Detective Loki who's solved every case he's ever been given. He may at times seem too detached from the parent's pain and rage - but he's a man who spots things and sees through the lies in people (a mesmerizing Jake Gyllenhaal). Obsessive yet law-abiding - he instinctively feels that spaced out Alex Jones who can't say much but can still drive an RV easily - is lying - sickly concealing the whereabouts of the girls and enjoying the cat and mouse game too (an Oscar performance yet again from Paul Dano - the preacher in ""There Will Be Blood""). But is he? And what about his heart-broken mother (subtle brilliance from Melissa Leo) who has defended this social outcast all her life - despite her religion-obsessed husband leaving years back and abandoning them both. Keller even goes after her. In the meantime Grace Dover (a ragged looking Maria Bello) simply breaks at the enormity of her child being lost - while the stoical Nancy folds her arms, grits her teeth and reconciles herself to what both fathers must do - go over demarcation lines you really shouldn't cross...

The genius of Aaron Guzikowski's script and Dennis Villeneuve's Direction is that one whole hour in - and you're absolutely none the wiser as to who is the bad guy and who isn't. And it has to be said that some of the violence is horrible and cringing. But what keeps you watching is the sheer visceral power of the actors. The dance between Jackman and Gyllenhaal is fantastic cinema - both men barely holding on to any humanity or faith as the frustration mounts and suspicions arise (exactly the sick kind of mental torture the abductor wants to inflict on them). And you also sit there questioning just how far a determined parent would go to get their child back (abusing a man who may or may not be an innocent).

Special mention has to be made of the picture quality of the BLU RAY. Defaulted to Full Aspect (which fills up the whole screen) - ""Prisoners"" is starkly gorgeous and truly beautiful throughout. Often without any music - the blunt and stainless steel cold angles ratchet up the tension to unbearable levels (fear of what is happening to the children). It's the Cinematography genius of ROGER DEAKINS (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""True Grit""). Scene after scene is filled with it: casing a house in the pouring rain at night - Jones walking his dog as Keller spies on him from a nearby truck - the decaying body tied to a chair in the basement of a suspect's house - Detective Loki interviewing a sex offender you can't see behind a filthy pane of glass - Loki's tired bulging eyes and unkempt stubble (hasn't slept for days) as he leans forward into a computer monitor scouring the screen for any detail that will help - closing in on the jagged bark of a tree... The framing of everything is the unsung hero of the movie - adding unbelievable depth and genuine unease that serves right up until the superb and clever ending.

There are two Extras - the short ""Every Moment Counts"" and the more extensive ""Powerful Performers"" which features enthusiastic interviews with all the principal actors, Director Dennis Villeneuve and Producers Kara Davis and Broderick Johnson. But don't watch ""Powerful Performers"" before you watch the movie - it rather clumsily gives away far too much in terms of the twisting plot.

The brilliant and unsettling ""Prisoners"" had my wife and I on the edge of our seats unable to press the pause button to desperately go to the loo. Now that's how you put the 'thrill' in thriller.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is back with another densely plotted movie with 'Prisoners'. His 2011 'Incendies' was interesting but ultimately full of too many scenes which forced the viewer to suspend one's disbelief, one too many times. 'Prisoners' also has some questionable plot points but it's eminently more entertaining than Incendies.

Villeneuve proffers up an interesting protagonist, Keller Dover (played by an intense Hugh Jackman), a survivalist type, who has no compunctions about teaching his son how to shoot a deer, on a hunting trip, depicted at the beginning of the film. While Jackman has a lot to work with depicting the hot-head Keller, Terrence Howard has little to do playing Franklin Birch, Keller's exact opposite: a passive (and thinly drawn) middle class black professional. The break into Act II occurs when Keller's and Birch's daughters are abducted after disappearing from the Birch family home.

Since an RV was parked right near where the girls disappeared, the driver ends up as the number one suspect. The police soon track the driver down at a rest stop and he tries to escape by eluding a police blockade with his RV. The driver turns out to be Alex Jones, who on the surface appears to be mentally feeble. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) can find no evidence linking Alex to the girls' abduction and concludes he doesn't have the mental capacity to kidnap the girls, he's forced to release him, and allow him to return to the residence of Holly Jones, his aunt, a creepy senior, expertly played by Melissa Leo.

A good deal of 'Prisoners' revolves around Keller's abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Alex, who he believes knows where the kidnapped girls are. Keller insists that Alex told him ""they didn't cry until I left them,"" when Keller tries to choke him at the time he's released by the police, in front of a multitude of TV news reporters (no one else hears what Alex says to Keller).

Before discussing the issue of Alex's refusal to talk, there are two red herrings in the plot, designed to throw you off track. Both involve Detective Loki's interaction with two suspects. The first is a priest who's on parole for a sex crime--out of the blue Loki finds a bound, deceased man in the priest's basement. The priest claims that he was forced to kill the man after he revealed (during confession) that he was a serial killer, who would kill again. Later, Loki chases after a suspicious man seen at a vigil for the missing girls, in front of the Birch's home. He turns out to be a wannabe serial killer, Taylor, who breaks into the family houses of real serial killer's victims and steals their clothes. Loki, who supposedly has solved all of his cases, blows this one, after Taylor grabs one of Loki's deputy's guns and shoots himself in the mouth.

Even if you believe in both these incredible turn of events, one is hard pressed to believe in the film's main premise--that Alex would refuse to talk, despite being tortured for days by Keller. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. One of the arguments that Alex doesn't talk is because he is mentally handicapped. But that's debunked by the points Keller raises--he knew about the girls and told Keller; he tried to escape from the police in his RV and had a driver's license and was able to drive.

Another reason (which seems to be suggested by the filmmakers) is that he's under the spell of Aunt Holly and is either a) afraid of her, b) evil like her, or c) both. He seemingly is given a free pass at film's end, despite Keller's statement that he confessed that he basically knew where the girls were (the free pass may be due to the fact that Keller's credibility was completely suspect, by breaking the law by abducting him). Still, while possible, I still think it's unlikely that Alex would never have turned against the old lady. Think of the child abduction case of Steven Stayner. He was imprisoned for seven years but when given the opportunity, he escaped and saved a newly abducted child. Alex was the first child abducted by Holly and her husband and the filmmakers would like us to believe he was psychologically beholden to his captor. But in real life, the Stayner case proves the opposite. I would like to think the desire for freedom would still burn in Alex's breast and his abduction by Keller would have been the perfect opportunity for him to spill the beans about his aunt. By confessing, he's smart enough to know that Aunt Holly would immediately be taken into custody and he would not have to be afraid of her anymore.

Prisoners represents a critique of those who embrace the survivalist mentality and act as vigilantes. We expect Keller to save his daughter but actually Detective Loki does so after racing to the hospital and saving Keller's daughter from poisoning (Loki's big car race is not that exciting, since the outcome is pretty much expected). Instead, Keller underestimates Holly who turns out to be responsible for the girls' abduction as well as numerous other serial killings. Keller ends up in that hole and my interpretation of the abrupt (but clever) ending, is that he WILL rescue Keller, and let him face the music.

'Prisoners' indeed will drag you into its electrically-charged story and keep you at the edge of your seat to the end. The supporting players, those who play the wives and children of Keller and Franklin, do quite well, but are saddled by underdeveloped parts. Ultimately, you will have to overlook the red herrings and the main premise that the feeble (or perhaps not so feeble) Alex, will not crack under torture. I prefer to believe that he would, as most people would in that situation.",1396137600,,5721,4.775530839231547

I am not one for gratuitous violence, but I can honestly say that I don't believe the violence in this film was gratuitous.  It was disgusting and painful, but it was far from disingenuous.

The entire time that Hugh Jackman's character, Keller Dover, is torturing who he is absolutely certain has something to do with his missing daughter - Jackman plays crazy-obsessive so well that you begin to ask yourself, ""Did this guy really do it, or is Keller torturing the wrong man?""  Especially when the tortured man whispers, ""Help me,"" to Nancy Birch (the mother of the other missing daughter; and supremely played by Viola Davis).

It is a very intense movie.  The writer (Aaron Guzikowski) and director (Denis Villeneuve) plotted out such a well-structured story, with actors who are incredibly believable.  There isn't a parental reaction that you can't empathize with:  Keller Dover/Hugh Jackman's obsessive need to defend and protect.  Franklin Birch/Terrence Howard willingness to find his daughter, but constantly questioning his own morality at torturing another human being.  Nancy Birch/Viola Davis just wants her daughter back; she supports Jackman's actions if there is even the slightest possibility of getting their children back.  Grace Dover/Maria Bello who is comatose with grief, but propels the story along for the detective (my favorite part of the movie was Jake Gyllenhaal).

And then there's Jake Gyllenhaal character Detective Loki; who is just as obsessed with finding the missing girls as Jackman, but he doesn't lose sight of the law or his place in the justice system.  As I said, this was a masterfully crafted movie.  It used the plot and characters to move it along and tell the story.  When was the last time that happened in a movie?  There is no over the top CG, just great acting and superb story telling.  I loved it!

This is the kind of movie where you have to pay attention because everything is a clue.  As I watched Jake Gyllenhaal interview Mrs. Millard, I kept thinking ""how does a child abduction over ten years old have anything to do with the suspect who barely looks twenty?"" ... but it was an integral part of discovering the culprit.

Also, Ive seen some reviews mention the language/cursing and I couldn't help but think, this is a movie about a man who decides to torture another human being who may or may not have had anything to do with his daughters abduction, and the one thing that bothered you is the cursing really??

Watch this movie, but I don't recommend this on a family movie night (too intense for the kiddies).  Prepare to yell at the TV (especially at the incredible ending), and cringe with frustration and hope.  I hope more movies rely on plot and characters.

This movie is not so easy to watch. From the actors' many fine performances to its somber tone, there is a heavy and real sense of dread that is likely off-putting for more sensitive viewers. You may have seen hundreds of films and shows where the heroes' lives are in peril, but they are all so cozy and trite by comparison. This film is the very rare exception where you become truly immersed in the story and empathize with its various gut-wrenching emotions of fear, doubt, sanity and rage. I honestly can't remember the last time I cared so much about a group of characters. From the outset, it's obvious that this is a serious and adult movie, one where nobody is safe, and a happy ending is hardly guaranteed after so many clever turns in the story. There is a darkness throughout even the heroes which can qualify the film as a neo-noir, despite its gloomy Northern country setting.

There are many other superb elements to this movie beyond its engaging plot. The film looks absolutely amazing thanks to multi-Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins, who's also shot Shawshank and a half-dozen of the Coen brothers' films. The score is perfectly simple but wonderful. The actors all give astoundingly heartfelt performances too.

If you can handle this movie's intensity, it will haunt you with its elegance. This is one of the finest mystery/thrillers made of recent years due to the powerful heart which accompanies the heady procedural.",1394668800,,1725,4.820945945945946

6070886,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve, 2013)

I'll be up front with you: I am writing the first sentences of this review, which I expect will be a very long one, without knowing what rating I will actually be giving Prisoners. I believe that somewhere over the course of the thousands of reviews I have written (Amazon is home to over six thousand of them as of this writing, on October 5, 2013, and I had been reviewing steadily for longer before I started posting there than I have been since I started, so you can do the math...) that has probably happened before...but I can't remember it, if it has. I have a great deal to mull over before figuring that out, I think. I liked it, overall; there is a great deal to like about it. It is surprisingly well-paced for having come out of a film culture where directors are actively encouraged to make their films about half as long as this one (this is the only film I have seen made in the last fifteen years that is this long that is not either (a) a musical, (b) a Shah Rukh Khan vehicle, or (c ) both of the above), it is unflinching in its examination of violence, its script is intelligent and multi-layered (though it does overplay its hand now and again), it is impeccably-cast, and I could keep going like this all night without really digging into the film at all. But it is not perfect, and while I admit I finished watching it less than an hour and a half before I am writing the opening words of this review, the more I think about the nagging questions I walked out of the theater with, the more they nag at me. Time will tell (and probably will, before I finish writing this review, which will probably be a few weeks from nowif I follow standard operating procedure with it, anyway) if they continue to nag, but the biggest thing that bothered me, and my first impression is that much of this comes from Jake Gyllenhaal being one of the male leads, is that I saw a lot of Zodiac in this movie. I also saw a lot of Snowtown, which is harder to explain away. That made some of what unfolded on the screen before me more predictable than, I think, it should have been; almost certainly more than screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) intended. But we shall see after I keep mulling it over; I'm going to go do some more of that right now.

Plot: Keller Dover (X-Men's Hugh Jackman) and Frankin Burch (Hustle and Flow's Terrence Howard) are friends in the suburbs. They get together for Thanksgiving; their daughters go out, saying they're heading over to the other house to do whatever it is that preteen girls do away form the prying eyes of their parents. They never make it. Suspicion is immediately cast on a broken-down old camper that has been seen in the area; when the police track it down in the dark corner of a convenience store parking lot, they find its driver to be young mentally-challenged Alex Jones (The Good Heart's Paul Dano). The police, in the form of one Detective Loki (The Day After Tomorrow's Jake Gyllenhaal), interrogate Jones, but do not have enough evidence to go anywhere with it; he is ultimately released, leading Dover to take matters into his own hands. Initially, Burch goes along with Dover's plan for extracting information, but the longer things go one, the more Dover pulls away not only from Burch, but from the rest of his life. Eventually, people start noticing that Alex has gone missing, and Detective Loki's focus hones in on Dover.

And now back to my initial paragraph, which I wrote five months before this one. About 80% of this movie is phenomenal, a thought-provoking journey into the motivations and actions of people who are driven to desperation. The other 20% feels as if it were tacked on for a commercial audience who would not be satisfied with that and needed some sort of conventional mystery to resolve. It's trite, relies on plot twists you've seen in half a hundred other movies of its ilk, and while it is as well-presented as the rest of the moviethese are all fine actors turning in fine performances, Villeneuve (Incendies) certainly knows his way around a camera, and  Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for his chilling cinematography (he lost to, of course, Gravity)it still feels kind of like the old Irving Pichel trick of hey, we finished shooting a week early and have some extra stock, let's make another movie!...except this time they stitched the two together, and the graft didn't quite take. The straight mystery at the end is watchable, but in juxtaposition to the drama/thriller/horror film that comes before it, it pales. Should you see it? Absolutely. Is it, as IMDB would have us believe as I am writing this in March 2014, one of the 250 best movies ever made (it is sitting at #249)? Not on your life. *** ",1394582400,,4756,4.56440281030445

6070888,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Two young girls are abducted after a Thanksgiving meal where their two families are celebrating in the home of one of them.  The girls have wandered outside to play and go unnoticed for some time while the families enjoy one another's company.  Eventually, people begin to notice their absence and then, very quickly, panic sets in and the two fathers (Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard) run off to look for them.  In the meantime Jackman's son remembers that, earlier, the girls were fascinated by a motorhome parked a little way down the street when they had gone out prior to dinner.  He tells his father and they go to look for the motorhome, which is now gone.

Enter the police, primarily in the form of Jake Gyllenhaal, who quickly locate the motorhome and its sole occupant and bring him into custody.  However, when they try to interrogate him they find that he has the mental age of a 10 year old and are forced to release him after a forensic search shows no physical evidence of the missing girls in the vehicle.

This incenses Jackman's character who decides to take matters into his own hands with grim consequences!  This film examines the obvious toll on all the members of a family whose child has been abducted and we witness the harrowing aftermath for all concerned as the tragedy unfolds before our eyes.  The movie seems more to have echoes of `Dead Zone' rather than `Taken', as it scrutinizes the almost Gothic weirdness of small town America beneath the Norman Rockwell homespun, 'apple pie' type images that we are often fed.

And it's all the more disturbing in the wake of the recent revelations, in Austria, America and elsewhere of kidnappings, imprisonment and even the enslavement of abducted children who seem simply to disappear into thin air and the twisted logic of the individuals who perpetrate this evil, often seeking to mitigate their actions in religious terms!

6070923,4,B00GBZVOEY,"If you have children, or if you are attached to a niece or nephew, then PRISONERS will make you quake in your boots from start to finish. It takes the most terrifying idea that a parent has, your child being abducted, and tosses it about in a fashion unseen before on screen. Is that a good thing? Yes.

The film opens with two families living in the same neighborhood getting together for Thanksgiving. One is Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello), the other Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terence Howard and Viola Davis). After dinner the Dover's daughter wants to run home with the Birch's daughter to look for a whistle she can't find. Terror soon follows.

The two girls can't be found and the older kids they were supposed to ask go with them never knew that they left. From an earlier walk Dover's son remembered an RV parked down the road that his sister tried to climb. A manhunt follows with everyone searching for the girls and that RV.

As it so happens Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhall) gets the call about a sighting of the RV. He gets to the scene only to have the driver speed into a tree and then be captured. What they find is a young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) with some mental issues who either can't or won't answer their questions. Keller can't believe the police are as helpless as he is when it comes to finding answers and holds them accountable.

The search continues and eventually Jones is released. Keller confronts him in the parking lot and Jones whispers something to him that makes Keller believe he knows what happened to the girls. Intent on finding his daughter, even if the police have their hands tied with legalities, Keller kidnaps Jones and takes him to an abandoned apartment building he owns. With the reluctant help of Franklin he systematically tortures Jones to get information. It's brutal but not over done considering what's on the screen these days.

As Keller seeks information his way Det. Loki follows clues of his own. With a record of solving every case he's been assigned he doggedly pursues each lead that comes his way. Some go nowhere but a few turn up a suspect other than Jones, one who turns up at a candle light vigil for the two girls and who escapes Loki when he pursues him on foot. This doesn't stop him from continuing his search as well as his looking at Keller as a possible suspect as well.

Do they find the girls? Are they still alive? And just who really kidnapped them if anyone? If you want to know what happens rent or buy the movie, don't expect me to give it away. The twists and turns in this plot bounce back and forth more than Mullholland Drive if it were ice covered and foggy. The movie does a great job of making you think one way then convincing you that you should look another only to toss in a third concept before making you think you were right to begin with. Got that? Well that's the sort of back and forth I'm talking about. In the end everything fits in place and the result is an ending that makes sense. I won't say you'll be happy with it, but it makes sense.

As seems to be the case with many films these days there isn't a bad performance on screen here. Jackman and Gyllenhall take center stage when it comes to outstanding performances, both exercising their acting muscles by playing parts different than we've seen them in before. Howard is given far too small a part to play here but does it well. Bello and Davis feel more like supporting roles than leads here and that's a shame. Dano once more plays that misunderstood character and does a fine job.

Don't let the 153 minute length scare you away. Time flies when you're watching this one and there isn't a boring moment. And when you get to the last 30-40 minutes you'll be wringing your hands waiting to see what happens next. This one is worth watching.",1393372800,,3833,4.473533619456366

6070961,2,B00GBZVOEY,"THE PRISONERS (2013) is basically well acted by both its stars (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gylllenhaal) and its supporting cast (Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, and Paul Dano), BUT from the very outset its IMPLAUSIBLE SCREENPLAY goes from one huge plot hole to another.

Following the opening scene in which a teenage boy is forced to shoot a deer by his RW survivalist father (played by Hugh Jackman), we see fresh venison being taken to the survivalist's BEST FRIEND'S big house for a two-family dinner ... after everyone in each family has hugged and kissed everyone else. Amazingly, and without any explanation, Jackman's wife and son and little daughter are ALL BEST FRIENDS with this other family, which just happens to be the only black family shown in the semi-rural small town in the entire movie. Given my own seven-decade experience of racism in America in New England, in the South, in the Midwest, and in the Northwest, I found this incredible as a story premise.

HERE BE A FEW SPOILERS - The first two of four prisoners referred to by the title are the two young daughters of Jackman and Howard (one white; one black) who within a very short time are kidnapped in broad daylight. (Later, two adults are held as prisoners by people NOT associated with the police.) Within minutes of the kidnapping, however, a super detective (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) apprehends a suspect, a retarded young man (Paul Dano), who seems to have been living with his elderly aunt, but (apparently) the police have the wrong man in custody and have to release him. This does NOT sit well with Hugh Jackman's macho, take-charge self-image: he decides to do some ""enhanced interrogation"" of his own, with the very reluctant help of his beloved black buddy (Terrence Howard). Prolonged GRAPHIC TORTURE SCENES ensue.

HERE BE A FEW MORE SPOILERS - Meanwhile Det. Gyllenhaal, who has never taken on a case without solving it, begins to suspect that a SERIAL KILLER is involved and tracks down an alternative suspect who has more than a few screws loose ... and while engaged in his own ""enhanced interrogation,"" Det. G. goofs up and brings about the death of that new suspect.

BUT WAIT, IT GETS WILDER - Just when there seems to be a dead end, as LUCK would have it, the little black girl CONVENIENTLY is able to escape her captor and reunite with her family! And somehow she puts Hugh Jackman on to a new trail ... which has a very bad outcome for him - besides him being shot. (At this point the audience knows for certain WHO the perverted serial killer is - and that ""answer"" is LITERALLY unbelievable.)

But of course there is MORE to come. Det. Gyllenhaal also discovers who that pervert is, and he too is shot (in the head) but keeps on ticking and SAVES not one but TWO prisoners of the pervert ... but not (tweet) at the same time (tweet).

The audience (tweet) expects Det. Gyllenhaal (who has NOT been suspended for causing the death of a suspect in custody and who immediately is released from the hospital and NOT kept under observation) to achieve some sort of additional unbelievable SUCCESS despite his head wound (tweet), and he (tweet) does so ... in exactly the (tweet) way that any eight-year-old who is halfway paying attention to this film will (tweet) easily (tweet) guess fifteen minutes before it (tweet, tweet) ends.

 If I were giving this film a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a ""D-"". A very good cast is almost TOTALLY WASTED here.",1392854400,2,3467,4.70957095709571

From the very beginning, you just know bad stuff is going to happen, and maybe it can't be put right again.  And the longer the movie goes, the more sure you are that this is an ""E"" Ticket to no place good, especially after dodging so many red herrings.  Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrance Howard and company perform beautifully (certainly no actress plays the distraught, disarrayed woman better than Maria Bello).  The pacing is slow and I just knew that even if the lost girls were found unharmed, the families would never ever be the same again.  It's a hard movie to watch when you consider the far-reaching consequences of the actions taken, but still I liked it overall.

6071017,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This is an intense movie within the first few minutes. It moves relatively slowly with not a lot of action but it's difficult to take your eyes away from the tremendous performances from a talented cast.

Hugh Jackman is riveting. The desperate father doing everything he can to find his daughter, even break the law. His performance reminded me a little of Mel Gibson's great performance in ""Ransom"" which featured a similar theme of the kidnapped child. Jackman's interplay with Gyllenhaal is powerful particularly in what is not said between them.

Melissa Leo, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Belo and Paul Dano all play excellent support roles.

It's quite a long movie (2.5 hours) but the time passes before you know it.

Highly recommended.",1391904000,,750,5.024193548387097
6071018,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I saw this on the recommendation of a friend/co-worker.  While the climax of the movie seems a bit forced, and the attempt by the filmmakers to make the plot like the labyrinth that holds the key to the kidnapped girls' location begins to get a bit tiresome, what sticks with me are the performances.  I've never been a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, but he more than rises to the occasion here as the obsessed father whose own suppressed demons begin to resurface.  It's a terrifying and sensitive performance that finally convinced me of his talent.  Paul Dano, who first caught my attention for his brilliance in ""There Will Be Blood,"" is pitiable as the mentally challenged young man who seems like the prime suspect.  His torture as the hands of Jackman's character happens mostly off-screen (thankfully), but he remains a sad, lost, sympathetic figure even when he's clearly hiding something.  My favorite performance, though, is Jake Gyllenhaal as the taciturn Det. Loki.  The ""defective detective"" has become a clich in modern procedural drama, but what makes Loki an intriguing character are the qualities only hinted at: the tattoos, the nerdy/hipster clothes and hair, the Freemasons ring, the involuntary blinking especially when stressed.  These all hint at a dark past that is never dragged into the spotlight and add to the character's mystery.  When Loki finally explodes, it's as if he's releasing everything he's repressed since before the events of this movie.  Brilliant acting and super backstory building by Gyllanhaal, who has impressed me since ""Donnie Darko.""

Unfortunately, other terrific actors get short shrift due to the trio of outstanding performances already mentioned.  Terrance Howard in particular is tragically underserved in his role as Jackman's friend and attempted voice of consciousness.  Viola Davis is onscreen even less, and poor Maria Bello is given almost nothing to do.  With the almost two-and-a-half running time, more insight into the grieving/coping of the mothers could have been powerful, but we don't get to see much of it.  Watch this for Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and Dano--their performances will stay wit you.",1391904000,,2158,5.196531791907514

We have a strong ensemble cast in this crime thriller, headed by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (both excellent, although Jake steals the show for me), and a mysterious case of child abduction that keeps us guessing. Overall, a powerful and harrowing drama. This one may linger with you afterwards, with its sinister and gloomy vibe.

The only gripe I have is (Don't read any further if you haven't seen the film) SPOILER ALERT*** why couldn't the filmmakers spare 20 more seconds at the end to show us whether or not Hugh Jackman's character survived???  Jake Gyllenhaal's cop character heard a faint noise and then the movie faded to black!  Filmmakers, that kind of device is very frustrating to your audience.",1391817600,,705,4.745901639344262

I was excited to finally watch it and  when I was 20-30 minutes into the film, I could already tell that I was not going to enjoy the rest of it. Don't get me wrong, the performances by everyone were great. However, there were a few things that happened throughout the movie that took me out of the viewing experience.

Things that were *literally* incredible. Some events and actions were just too unrealistic for me. I would name some examples, but I don't want to add any spoilers to this review. I felt that many of the scenes were over-acted for dramatic effect. I found the gratuity of these scenes to be ridiculous and even laughable. I was just bored and uninterested. The use of red herrings and Macguffins made for an interesting story, but I felt that they couldn't hold the movie together. I am so disappointed in this film and would actually like a refund for my digital rental. If you want to see a similar film involving a dark story with mystery, suspense, and action, I recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (American version).

I don't recommend spending your 153 minutes on this film.",1391472000,2,1208,4.557603686635945

6071047,2,B00GBZVOEY,"This film was unnecessarily violent and melodramatic. Hugh Jackman obviously wants to move to more dramatic, heavyweight roles and he is talented enough to do so. But this scrip was the wrong choice to begin that transition. His character bordered on the hysterical and psychotic in his search for his kidnapped daughter--was the script, the director, or Jackman himself responsible for this portrayal? We'll never know. But nothing toned down the performance, no nuance, no real examination of the character's background, his relationship with his daughter, nothing to explain the explosive personality beyond the obvious--my daughter has been kidnapped. We needed background scenes. The character was as cold-blooded and as unexplored as the psyche of the kidnapper. Next time around Jackman should look for a character with nuance, control, intensity; one the audience can identify with in some way. This performance, this film left me dead in the water.",1391472000,2,957,5.429530201342282

6071057,3,B00GBZVOEY,"The premise is engaging. Two cute kid girls go missing during a Thanksgiving dinner between neighbors. The obvious fear is a kidnapping. And if that's the case, they'll probably be raped and killed. Such an outcome could make for a mighty poignant movie. But writer Aaron Guzikowski and director Denis Villeneuve would rather cater to the morals of its audience, so blunt realism is overshadowed by silly unlikelihoods, more and more as the story goes on. The actions of Keller Dover, the father of one of the young daughters, are particularly outrageous.

Like SOTL it starts to have spiritual undertoe of something good trying to get out .  There is a glimmer of hope.  For most of the film it seems like the movie doesnt care about its inhabitants.

6071100,1,B00GBZVOEY,"For a film that is over two and a half hours long, there are so many plot holes in Prisoners Im almost tempted to wish that it was three hours in length, and then again, maybe I just wish that it had never been made.  Watching the film in the first place took inner strength, since the subject matter is one that I have a very strong reaction to, but I expected to at least be rewarded with a thought provoking film that tested my inner calm but delivered a strong impact.

Instead, I was left with confusion, frustration and indifference.

Honestly, it was like screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski and director Denis Villeneuve thought that if you throw enough unnecessary details into a pot and stir them, the audience won't notice the plot holes because theyll be as distracted as Detective Loki by a bunch of stuff that makes no sense and means absolutely nothing.

The premise of Prisoners is a relatively simple one.  The Dovers and the Birchs are neighbors and friends.  They hang out a lot, apparently.  One day, while they are socializing at the Birch residence, their young daughters leave to find a lost whistle and wind up missing.  They search to no avail and then the police are brought in and despite having a lead, there is nothing solid and no real evidence that they can get their hands on and Keller Dover soon feels the need to take matters into his own hand.  In a move that many fathers in this position would contemplate but never actually act out, Keller kidnaps the prime suspect, locks him in an abandoned building, and tortures him for answers he won't divulge.  Keller just KNOWS that this young man (who is obviously mentally handicapped) has the answers to where these little girls are and so he continues to beat and torture him despite getting nothing out of him.  The Birch family becomes involved, but they remain at a distance (or at least as much as possible).  In the meantime, Detective Loki becomes consumed with unraveling the mystery of these vanished girls and follows up on the few leads he gets only to find himself preoccupied by the suspicious activity of Keller himself.

As the days tick by, the prospect of finding these girls alive grows slim.

I have SO MANY issues with this film that discussing them would almost take an entire day, but Ill try and just sputter.  It really all boils down to a film about complete incompetence.  First off, these parents are kind of dense.  You let your little girls leave the house to wander down the street in search of a whistle, and despite the fact that you make it clear you never let them wander off alone you forget they ever left until hours have gone by, even with the knowledge of a creepy van on the street?  That doesnt make sense to me at all.  Be attentive!  Next, Loki seems to be the ONLY person on the police team to be remotely interested in seeing these girls reunited with their families.  Despite having a suspect, they drop the ball and don't even tail him, allowing him to be kidnapped and have the police be none the wiser.  Next, you have a suspect with a creepy van parked outside of his Aunts home, and she admits that he does that all the time, and yet you don't investigate her house or her property for clues?  How is that?  Shouldnt that have been the FIRST thing you did, even if you didn't suspect her of anything?  Then you have Keller, who does what every man in that situation is thinking, and yet you allow yourself to become a complete monster by brutally assaulting a man who is three shades away from going full retard?  I mean, how does that solve anything?  This is an issue with me because you basically have a man beating on a child to get answers as to what he supposedly did with a child.  Maybe this is the moral dilemma we are supposed to face, but the film seems so uninterested in making Keller anything more than the savior of his children.

Incompetence, both in character and in filmmaking.

But lets get into that incompetent filmmaking for a minute.  What about all those details that are all over the place?  You can spin your wheels all you want and color in every surface and draw those mazes all over the place, but at the end of the day it all feels like a waste of time.  Lets have this creepy guy buy kids clothes and sneak into the victims homes that so the audience will think he had something to do with it only to have him off himself before he explains anything to anyone and then just drop it without really explaining anything (yes, I know who he wasbut what was he doing in the Dover and Birch residence?).  Lets throw mazes all over the walls and then shows a flashback with a book of mazes and a creepy message and thennot explain what the mazes have to do with anything!  Lets give the kidnapper this ridiculous backstory and then never talk about it past a solitary comment.

Lets spend two and a half hours doing absolutely nothing but giving the impression that we are doing a LOT!

And don't even get me started on the ending.  This is what I mean about these holes in plot that just don't add up.  Keller discovers the truth, but instead of informing the police and rushing to the rescue with Loki, he runs FROM the police and goes there alone, only to dig himself into a very deep hole (literally) and then, when all is said and done it takes quite a bit of time before the police do anything about investigating the area in which the crime took place (once again, wouldnt that be the FIRST thing you did?).

That stupid whistle.

But the ensemble is great, right?  Sort of.  They all work to an extent, but the only one who really does a lot with what hes given is Jake Gyllenhaal.  He actually works to flesh out Loki and his obsessions, while the others tend to give a glossed over variation of a solitary emotion.  Jackman yells and glares and then prays.  Davis cries.  Howard awkwardly holds his mouth in shock and looks like he wants to pee in his pants.  Maria Bello kind of disappears from the whole movie only to reappear as a loon.  Paul Dano doesnt have the chance to do much but look scared and scream.  Melissa Leo gets saddled with a ridiculous character, and while she sells it Im not quite sure I care for what shes selling.

Conceptually, Prisoners had promise.  As a father (of two young girls about the age of the ones kidnapped here), I was not looking forward to watching this.  My biggest fear is something like this.  Abuse is bad enough, but not knowing where and what is happening to your children is the WORST feeling in the world, and I have to admit, I was totally TEAM KELLER for the first half of this film, but Prisoners doesnt know how to develop this concept in a way that feels authentic or even intelligent.  It all just feels so stupid.",1390867200,5,6733,4.430081300813008

The concept of everybody being Prisoners is also not fleshed out properly, and the scene at the beginning of the deer in the woods being shot has nothing to do with the rest of the story and completely unnecessary. The film couldn't make up its mind whether it was about Jackman's character or Gyllenhaal's. I've never seen a cop character as clueless and out-dated as this one in this day and age. He doesn't know how to use the computer, he can't see what's right under his nose, and he has no idea who anybody is in his own town! Jackman is over the top as usual, Howard is totally wasted in the film, and everybody else phoned it in. I'm sure the script read better when they agreed to the project, as there were so many scenes that were obviously cut out from the film for time (why were there so many scenes that faded to dark as the most important revelatory moments of drama?).

6071113,3,B00GBZVOEY,"NO SPOILER ALERT: I did craft this review in such a way that you might think it contains a spoiler. It's doesn't. You'll have to find your own way to learn how the movie ends.

I like really good suspense movies. ""Prisoners"" looked dark enough. Good cast, decent ratings, what could go wrong?

""Prisoners"" serves up plenty of suspense. It's got a good storyline, if you can follow it ... or stay awake while it meanders down a long and twisted path. It's about madness and mayhem, saints and sinners, the lost and forgotten, the found and forgiven, Nearly each character is a whack job. And Hugh Jackman can really scream in bass.

I'm often disappointed when a movie I want to see is a mere 90 min. I feel cheated. That won't happen again. With ""Prisoners,"" I got what I longed for - a story with some meat behind it. Two and a half hours worth. Yeah!  However, I found myself checking my watch every 15 minutes to see how much longer the torture would go on.

After a very long ride, you want out of this car. You're ready for an ending. Any ending. Near the end, I stopped caring if the children were dead or alive. I just wanted to put a cap on it. When the denouement comes, you'll wake up awash with an emotion: anger. You'll want to kill the screenwriter, the producers, the actors. Ultimately, we are its last victim as the ending we so waited for washes away like a bad roll in the sack, unsatisfied.

I can't recommend it. I don't want you to go through the torture I went through, waiting till all the bodies turn up. Who knows, though, you might like it. Plenty of people did.",1390694400,2,1588,4.32996632996633

Writer: Aaron Guzikowski.

Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Content including Torture, and Language throughout.

Let's get this right out of the way for Prisoners: It is not a happy a movie. If you're expecting a good time or to come out with a smile on your face, this is not your type of movie. You would be much better off popping in something like Pacific Rim or seeing if Frozen is still playing where you live. But even if a film is horribly depressing, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it if given the chance. Far from it with something like Prisoners, the English language debut of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies). While its grueling content and odd plot points may cause some contention with viewers, Prisoners delivers on damn near every cylinder you should expect to see in a good mystery: Excellent performances, a plot that keeps you guessing till the very end, haunting cinematography and some interesting debates on morality and what one would do and how far they would go to save a loved one.

One day, somewhere in Pennsylvania, a small get together with two families is going on. Set sometime around Thanksgiving, the two families The Dovers (Hugh Jackman playing Keller and Maria Bello playing Grace) and The Birches (Viola Davis playing Nacy and Terrence Howard playing Franklin) are having a nice get together. Everybody's laughing, chowing down tasty food, just having a good time together. The teens hang out while the youngsters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, are off playing around in the neighborhood.

A few hours latter, the two youngest disappear. An investigation is soon kicked into motion and headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to find out who it is Eventually, the find a suspect in the form of mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Paul Dano). But due to the fact there is a lack of evidence on whether he did it or not, he winds up being released. The father of one of the families, Keller Dover, however, becomes increasingly unstable over the course of the investigation, resorting to his own (brutal) methods to find out if Alex actually did it or not.

So yes, as one can tell from that synopsis up top, Prisoners isn't what one would call a ""feel good movie"". On top of that, it isn't one that goes by quick. It fully expects you to sit down and watch as it takes you on a long journey of what its like to have a child taken from you. Whether you have or haven't had kids, you feel steeped in the misery and horror of what the parents go through in the film. Hell, the film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating before it got re-edited with a R. Frankly, after watching the film itself, it doesn't surprise me that it almost got the former.

Another interesting note to make is that in addition to being a Drama-Mystery-Thriller, the film is also a play on morality. Most of the characters never stay clean for long, especially High Jackman's character, who pulls some especially dickish things to find his kid. As seen in the trailers (don't worry; this all happens in the first half hour), he winds up kidnapping Alex to find out where the children are, but what he does will make your stomach churn. Even as the film went as on, I found myself conflicted with his character, wanting him to find his kids but I wished he'd stop being such an ass in trying to find his kid. The film itself and its characters are even asking themselves if what they're doing is justified or not.

What I found interesting about the film is that you never really know who's who or what till the end. For the majority of the film's running time, it keeps you guessing on whether Alex did it or not. Is he playing stupid? Does he genuinely not know what happened to the kids? Was he manipulated into doing what he did? It's like being in a maze, a nightmarish labyrinth from where there is no escape from until the very end.

The film's performances are uniformly excellent, with Hugh Jackman showing us a scary side of his acting abilities that we haven't seen before. His character shows a broad range of anger, ruthlessness and regret. The performance as Dover is so good, it outright makes his iconic Wolverine role look downright pathetic by comparison. I can also safely say that thanks to this role, Jackman's was able to partially redeem himself after being in last year's blunderpiece Movie 43. He's not quite there yet, but I hold him in much higher regard than I did after 43. The rest of the supporting cast also give great performances as well. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the best actors working today, with an almost equally compelling side role as the determined Detective Loki. One scene in particular that stands out for me with him is when flips out in his office. I won't say what happens in regards to that part in what triggers him, but damn, he really lost it in a big way.

Terrence Howard and Paul Dano bring their goods to the table as well, as does Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Melissa Leo also shows up as Alex Jones' mother, Holly, and while she doesn't have that many scenes in the film, she is compelling enough to keep an admirable presence on-screen. Even the kids who play Joy and Anna (Kyla Drew Simmons and Erin Gerasimovich, respectively) do their roles without some kind of saccharine or sickly-sweet kind of way that one would usually expect from kids in movies.

Shot by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption), Prisoners looks unsurprisingly beautiful in its imagery. Damn near every frame looks downright perfect, with scenes that look like they were molded by a paint brush than a camera. Denis and Deakins obviously know what they're doing, and I hope that they collaborate more in the future. Then there's the score by Jhann Jhannsson, who achieves haunting yet minimalist work that help establish the mood of the picture quite excellently.

If there were any problems I had with the film, I'd say it would be some plot elements. There's something that happens to Paul Dano's character in which he ends up disappearing from the public eye and it doesn't really get addressed until the last 30 minutes of the movie. Arguably, due to the investigation of the girls, I can see how their disappearance could be held in higher regard than Dano's but it was still a little something that bothered me.

Then there's how the film handles its clues, foreshadowing and red-herrings, in which it maybe just a little too clever for its own good. It's great to see a film keep its audience guessing all the way through and then pull the rug under their feet when they least expect it, but it felt like the movie was getting a little overly complicated. Not that it was a major hindrance to the film's quality, but I can see how some would be fed up with the plot twists and the loopty loops the film pulls from time to time.

It's a shame that the film was missed at the Oscar season. It was a big contender in the first couple of weeks it came out but due to being swarmed by a mountain of other films (Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street), it sadly got overlooked and wound up with only a nom for Best Cinematography. Yet, in spite of that, its more than worth checking out. Its imagery, performances and plot won't leave you for a while and it will keep you engaged all the way through its long running time.",1390608000,,7560,4.62220566318927

There was an awful lot of foreshadowing and it is pretty drawn out so I can understand some of the negative reviews.  you have to understand that the audience sees the whole situation unfolding while the detective and father only see half of the facts.

There were a few style cliches that were overtly noticeable to me - the biggest being the weather constantly setting the tone of the scene - really, constantly.  The mother being a worthless emotional wreck was a bit overdone.  The whistle being so important throughout was definitely strained.

Overall, a very good movie.  Its depressing, so its a ""one viewing and done viewing"" kind of thing I'd recommend a rental over a purchase.

6071124,5,B00GBZVOEY,"No Spoilers until marked.

This movie represents some of the best acting, and tightest plot spinning I have ever seen on screen! Prepare yourself for a very emotional, suspenseful, anxiety ridden maze-like trip through a parent's worst nightmare- this movie hits home hard for those of us with children but it's breathtaking raw emotion, keep-you-guessing type plot, and fantastic acting makes it well worth the heartache.

The acting is fantastic all around but Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano steal the show! By the end of the movie, I was left especially hungry to learn more about Gyllenhaal's ""Detective Loki."" The details of his character are incredibly interesting and fitting for his role. Jackman was intense... and I do mean INTENSE. His visceral desperation and anger are felt more than just seen. And Dano brings something to the screen that I have never before seen. We are told he is a mentally disadvantaged man with an intellect no greater than a ten year old and the way this plays out on screen is just brilliant. I'll leave it at that for this non-spoiler part of the review. The rest of the cast does very well also, particularly Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch though the movie does not center around their characters quite as much.

The cinematography was brilliant. There were some scenes that could easily have been movie posters, I won't spoil them for you. Overall the movie was beautifully shot.

As far as music and sound go, I have to say I don't remember any of the music from the film. This is not necessarily a bad thing as I would prefer it not be memorable in a bad way so as to distract from what is being portrayed but it also means that it wasn't amazing. The sound, however, is a different story. There were moments of complete silence in the movie where the silence itself was a sound effect. There were intense moments that were accented by incredibly clear and poignant sound that fit the scene.

Plot, oh boy was there plot! A great, edge of the seat, thrilling plot that just smacked me in the face every couple of minutes! The movie goes on for about 2.5 hours and the whole time I was glued to the screen. What an incredible story!

*******************************************************************************************************************

Ok, just so we are all on the same page, I am going to go through the plot and piece things together since there seems to be a bit of confusion on Who Bobby Taylor was, how joy escaped, and what the Leo's were actually doing to children.

We start off being introduced to Keller Dover and his son , Ralph. Keller recites the Lord's Prayer and his son lines up a shot for a deer. This scene is blatantly metaphorical for ""doing what is necessary"" in Keller's perspective. It also shows how Ralph is becoming a man. This plays well against Alex Jones because it shows you what Alex never had and why he isn't a ""man"" but rather still a 10 year old boy. (Obviously abuse and drugs/snake venom had something to do with it too). This is how Keller works, he doesn't enjoy killing the deer but it is necessary to him and the ends justify the means. The prayer shows us that he doesn't ""shoot the deer"" for his own enjoyment, it is a means by which he can get what he needs for his family. This foreshadows the exact sentiment felt when he tortures Alex.

We can now skip ahead to the children disappearing. We meet Detective Loki. He has tattoos but he hides them constantly. He clasps his hands to hide his knuckle tattoos and he buttons his shirt to the top button to hide his neck tattoos. He wears a masonic ring, His tattoos and his opening lines indicate that he has an interest in Zodiac signs and astrology- all information we are given throughout the film indicates that he had a rough past and was possibly a criminal turned cop. Loki is a prisoner of his past.

Keller becomes a prisoner to his desperation, doing things he would never have done under normal circumstances, likewise his wife becomes a prisoner to her medication as a way of dealing with the tragedy of losing her daughter. Ralph becomes a prisoner of the house, his father the jailor. He is told to watch over his mother and stay home. Alex becomes Keller's prisoner in a very literal sense.  The children are obviously prisoners- I could go on. Everyone in the movie is a prisoner to something by this point.

The RV is gone over CSI-Miami style and nothing is found- this is because Alex merely let the kids in, let them play and sing while he drove them to his ""aunt's"" house. This is what he meant when he said ""They didn't cry until I left them."" It also explains Ms. Leo's later comment that he only played with the children. Loki continues tracking down leads by visiting local sex offenders and happens upon a body in the creepy as f*** basement/crawl-space/nightmare-dungeon under the Priest's house. This body is wearing a necklace with a  circular maze etched on it, hmmmmm. It is also explained that the man has kidnapped and killed at least 16 children. This man is Ms. Leo's husband that she said disappeared after a fight. He is also the ""invisible man"" that the book in Bobby Taylor's house is about.

Speaking of Bobby Taylor, aka ""The Snake Guy,"" he was a former abductee, taken by the Leo's when he was  just a boy. He escaped somehow, it isn't ever explained, but he is now damaged and seeks to recreate the efforts of his captors to try and understand their motives. He is obsessed with it, going as far as stealing abducted children's clothes, spattering them with pigs blood and claiming to have killed them. He buries child-manikins in his yard after bashing in their heads. He is a mixture of a victim with Stockholm syndrome, a child, and a copycat killer. He too, is a prisoner to his past, he even goes so far as to wear the same jacket as Ms. Leo does (more on that later).

So the Leo's have had a process that is now continued only by Ms. Leo since Mr. Leo is dead. By the end of the movie, we should be able to conclude that The Leo's had a son who died of cancer. They were religious prior to this and afterward, unable to reconcile the tragedy with their religion, they reject their religion and begin to ""wage war on god"" by abducting other people's children, creating ""demons"" aka the broken, parents of the abducted children. They do this alone at first and later by having Alex find and pick up children. The children are then delivered to the Leo's house where they are given Kool-Aid laced with ketamine and LCD and told that they can leave when they have solved a book fool of mazes. The catch is, the last maze, the same one that Mr. Leo wore around his neck, is unsolvable. Eventually the children are injected with snake venom and buried. This is exactly what happened to Joy and Anna but Joy was able to get away before she was injected. (Some might argue that there is a different order to it but this is the gist. All these things happen, it may be done in a different order depending on the kid)

How did Joy get away? The movie tells you but it is a bit difficult to piece it together. We see Joy's flash backs when she is in the hospital room and it shows a person wearing a jacket carrying Anna in the right arm and reaching for Joy (who is running away) with her left. It also shows two bottles of the laced Kool-Aid, one full and one half empty. We can deduce that it was Ms. Leo in the Jacket, and that Joy did not drink her Kool-Aid. This fits with what Ms. Leo said about having to move the girls inside after Detective Loki was snooping around the car outside. Thus when Ms. Leo was moving them inside, Joy ran away and was picked up by a passing motorist.

All this is pieced together when Keller visits Joy in the hospital and she says ""You were there. She put tape on our mouths!"" Keller thinks back and realizes the only place he has gone where there was a female suspect was the Leo's home. Joy must have heard his voice through the thin walls. He gains entry by half-heartedly pretending to offer assistance fixing up the house and ignores the obviously hidden weapon in her hand. This is the only part of the plot that made me cringe. We all knew she had a gun, and Keller should have too.

So he gets drugged, shot,  and thrown in the pit- Loki finds Alex in Keller's old apartment building, in pretty bad shape assumingly. He is tasked with telling Ms. Leo they found Alex. Detective Loki lets himself in, finds Ms. Leo injecting Anna with venom and a firefight ensues, in which Loki gets grazed on the head and Ms. Leo gets gunned down. The scene where Loki drives Anna to the hospital was amazing. The lighting, the blurry eyes, the rain, the anxiety... MAN! PERFECT!

The end of the movie wraps up pretty neatly. Loki hears Keller blowing the whistle and we know that he finds Keller, and we know that Keller goes to Jail (based on previous comments made by Loki in the hospital).

This movie used the maze as a theme constantly. Think about how you would solve a maze on a piece of paper, following one trail until it dead ends and having to backtrack and pick a different branch, sometimes overlooking the right path until it is the only one left. That is how the plot played out, that is how each prisoner felt inside their prison. Beautiful.",1390435200,70,9505,4.517161140197789

6071136,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Good story?  Check.  Great performances?  Check.  Well-directed?  Check.

But I can't recommend it because it's just so dang disturbing that I don't want to be responsible for you seeing it.  I happened to watch Seven Psychopaths the previous week, and seeing this so shortly after gives me a good way to define ""graphic"" violence versus ""strong"" violence.  Seven Psychopaths was graphic in that you see lots of blood and gore, while Prisoners doesn't (in fact, it will often cut away from violent scenes, leaving it up to your imagination).  But Prisoners was much more unsettling because of the way it was presented.  Frankly, the movie is dang creepy on many levels.

But it's a great movie when evaluated on its own merits.  It delivers a complete story without any cop-outs and the viewer can look back on the movie after it ends and see the clues left along the way.  In that sense, it's an outstanding film.  But it will probably be too disturbing for many viewers.",1390348800,,972,4.74251497005988
6071137,5,B00GBZVOEY,This movie is awesome. It is nearly 2 1/2 hours but it is so involving it seems like minutes. The ending was a complete surprise. I would definitely recommend this!,1390348800,,164,4.5
6071138,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Overall good and intriguing movie, just some unnecessary excessive foul language. The acting was superb and I would watch it again",1390262400,,130,5.238095238095238
6071139,5,B00GBZVOEY,"There are no ""spoilers"" here.  The trailer left me with the impression that this was just a movie about a crazed father who kidnapped a man he thought kidnapped his daughter and tortured him to get answers.  It is that but it is so much more. A thriller and real mystery movie with more twists and  turns than Lombard Street in San Francisco.  The end of this movie will leave you speechless.  This is the best movie I've seen in a year or more.",1390262400,,445,4.25
6071140,5,B00GBZVOEY,Hugh Jackman gives a face to vigilante justice with all it's righteous ugliness.  I actually felt sorry for the would be perp.  This story has twist after twist and quality acting that does a good job at making one stop and think about what we would turn into if it was one of our children.  I don't want to let too much out of the bag to spoil the movie so I will end here.  Anyone who finds it boring did not watch it all.,1390262400,,424,3.9529411764705884
6071141,4,B00GBZVOEY,"The trailers suggested a muddled family crisis drama, but this turned out to be a direct, though nuanced, detective story. Strong performances by all involved support an interesting narrative style that fully justified the longer running time. Sometimes you wonder why so many big names want to be in a movie, but in this case it was quite clear. Well worth the rental.",1390262400,,369,4.873015873015873
6071142,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Great Movie & a great cast. Makes you think...""What would I do in this situation"". Ending makes you want for more!",1390262400,,114,4.476190476190476
6071143,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I think this was a great movie. It kept us in suspense until the end. You really feel for the dad in this situation, but he's not the only person who's been hurt.",1390262400,,162,3.9393939393939394
6071144,5,B00GBZVOEY,"why is it necessary to use the ""F"" word? It was an excellent movie, but the foul language really put me off.",1390262400,,108,3.9545454545454546
6071145,4,B00GBZVOEY,Enjoyed the depth of character development. Plot evolved throughout film with no flat spots. Even the weather fits perfectly with this dark drama.,1390262400,,146,5.391304347826087
6071146,5,B00GBZVOEY,Amazingly written and acted. We loved it!  Very disturbing and thought provoking! The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.,1390262400,,143,4.72
6071147,4,B00GBZVOEY,It has a good star line-up and definitely a good twist and suprise ending.  I wish the ending would have given more.,1390262400,,116,4.2727272727272725
6071148,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie when it was in the theater, because it was about a topic that could really happen.  I friend saw it and sad it was good.  This movie was terrific and keeps you on the edge of you seat.  It is nice not to be able to figure out the ending.",1390262400,,278,3.6779661016949152
6071149,3,B00GBZVOEY,Very entertaining as a suspenseful depiction of a father's acceptable lengths to recover his kidnapped child. Very honest depiction of the mental torment by all connected.,1390262400,,171,5.615384615384615
6071150,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I highly recommend this movie, if you like dark, gritty, suspenseful. It challenges the bounds of morality, and leaves you wondering what you would do when faced with the difficult situations these flawed characters encounter.",1390262400,,226,5.485714285714286
6071151,3,B00GBZVOEY,this movie has great suspense but moves a bit slow. I did enjoy it even though its a big long also.,1390262400,,99,3.761904761904762
6071152,4,B00GBZVOEY,This is very good and could have been great with a better editor. It seems that much of the back story for the detective was cut from the movie but it's still an entertaining movie that goes to some disturbing territory.,1390262400,,220,4.390243902439025
6071153,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Given the disappointment of so many movies, this one at least delivers a good tale, emotional buy-in, and good acting. It is based on a parent's worst nightmare.",1390262400,,161,4.785714285714286
6071154,3,B00GBZVOEY,"Had to give this one an ""Okay"" rating.  Not exactly as good as I expected with the great cast... quite honestly it was just a little predictable.  It's an alright movie if you're bored & nothing else looks good.  This one will probably hit Netflix in no time at all.",1390176000,,266,4.28
6071155,4,B00GBZVOEY,"The ending should have played out to show whether or not the detective located little Anne's father.  The movie was good, but did not like the ending.",1390176000,,150,4.555555555555555
6071156,5,B00GBZVOEY,It was one of those movies where you thought you knew where it was going right up toward the very end.  All the actors did a fantastic job!  HELD MY ATTENTION THROUGHOUT!,1390176000,,170,4.28125
6071157,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Holy Moly this was a good movie.  Very intense and definitely a nail bitter.  A must see, but take your blood pressure medicine before you start the movie, hahaha.",1390176000,,163,4.586206896551724
6071158,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie seems like it flew under the radar but It's a good, edge of your seat thriller with excellent performances. Worth a second viewing!",1390176000,,142,4.72
6071159,1,B00GBZVOEY,"I cannot fathom all the great reviews for this movie.  It is way too long, Gyllenhall is the lone cop assigned to a double kidnapping case and stumbles through it like Eddie Munster on Quaaludes (there must be huge back story here, but thank God they didn't include it), so many, many plot holes it's ridiculous ... it makes no logical sense at all.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching Jake and Hugh compete in a game of dueling eyebrows.  Forget about it!",1390176000,13,458,4.428571428571429
6071160,2,B00GBZVOEY,"What could have been a good movie turned into a Hollywood embellishment of an interesting story.  Acting was good, editing was horrible, way to many improbable scenes - especially the car rush to the hospital. Why does Hollywood seem to think everyone is interested in a car chase melodrama.  This was as bad as the chasing scene in 'Argo'.  There are better movies out there.",1390176000,,376,4.753846153846154
6071161,5,B00GBZVOEY,this movie keeps you on edge till the VERY END. definatly a suspense movie! I would recommend it to anyone.,1390176000,,107,4.4
6071162,4,B00GBZVOEY,I thought it was very intense and the ending kept you guessing.  What I didn't like was the obscenities  used by the actors.  Not necessary.,1390176000,,140,4.52
6071163,5,B00GBZVOEY,One of the best movies ever seen over the past couple of years .Jake Gylenhal is amazing as the lead detective,1390176000,,110,4.285714285714286
6071164,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Was a lot better than i thought it would be,got some good twist in the movie,worth the time to watch",1390176000,,100,4.05
6071165,5,B00GBZVOEY,It kept me watching thru out the entire film. Great movie to watch. It will keep you on your toes.,1390176000,,98,3.95
6071166,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Loved it. Keeps you on the edge of you seat. The story that is. I know Maria Bello and Terrance Howard can act better, but this is not one of their better movies. Unfortunately, it had a lousy ending. Still worth seeing though.",1390089600,,227,4.3023255813953485
6071167,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I love Hugh Jackman and do not understand why he and Jake Gyllenhaal were not Oscar-nominated for their performances.
I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and am still trying to process it.  It is so much more than the kidnapping of 2
little girls on Thanksgiving.  All of the performances were extraordinary and it was hard to watch at times but I could not
stop watching.  It is intense, disturbing, dark and suspenseful.  Did Loki respond to the whistle or not?  I will always wonder.",1390089600,,497,4.666666666666667
6071168,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Do you love Penny Auctions? Watch this movie with grilled cheese and tomato soup. You'll need...find out why, butt crumb",1390089600,,120,5.05
6071169,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie may not be a big rated movie,  the story was very interesting and at times, really had me questioning.  The ending blew me away!  I definitely liked it, it was different but held my interest.",1390089600,,202,4.405405405405405
6071170,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This was a great movie with an exciting twist,, I started off routing for what i thought was a good guy but as the movie progressed I wasn't sure any more who was the good guy and who was the bad, very good writing!!!",1390089600,,217,3.9545454545454546
6071171,3,B00GBZVOEY,An interesting movie with lots of twists set against an upstate New York winter landscape. The problem with the movie is the 2 1/2 hour length. There are many slow scenes that are not needed and the pace could be picked up in many scenes. At least 30 minutes should be trimmed from the running time. The winter scenes in the sleet and snow were very well done.,1390089600,,360,4.3088235294117645
6071172,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat.
The acting in this movie was one of the best I've ever seen!  A MUST see!!",1390089600,,116,3.4615384615384617
6071173,4,B00GBZVOEY,I enjoyed it. It was a little cheesy at times but overall I liked it. I love both. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal!,1390089600,,116,4.086956521739131
6071174,1,B00GBZVOEY,"I expected a decent intelligent film, if a bit slow. What I got was a long drawn out unrealistic movie that allowed Hugh Jackman to try to get an oscar.

The world the story takes place is totally unrealistic.

The take away is that rural PA is filled with some creepy people.

A gun would never enter into the interview room.

The initial primary suspect disappears right after the father attacks him in front of a crows including media. Yet, NOBODY investigates the missing suspect.

A detective would not steal evidence from a house like the little camper vehicle.

There are NO neighbors who see anything. Despite having a photo realistic picture of a secondary suspect, NOBODY has ever seen him.

Despite it being a kidnapping, there is no FBI presence at all. Seemingly, the little local PD with 3 or so Officers are the only ones working on a double child kidnapping. Okay dokie.

The wife reports someone in the house, goes on to specifically tell them which window was open and they didn't even do a walk around as our Detective did later on.

The torture of the mentally challenged suspect was a huge part of the movie. The neighbors took part, so in addition to our main Father going to prison, the two neighbors will also be going away.

The Detective is tailing the father to a liquor store where he parks and starts walking away from his truck. The DETECTIVE sits in his car as a dump truck comes from behind and starts BEEPING at him to move. The car is in the street.  The DETECTIVE cannot figure out to simply drive a a bit to allow the truck to go where he needs to?????  Instead he sits there and mutters""go around"" to himself and allows the truck to beep a few more times bringing attention to himself. LOL.

After the first day the suspect is taken into custody, there is media outside the police station and a vigil being held at one of the children's houses, but seemingly NOT at Anna's house???  Huh?  Despite there being initial media attention, within a DAY they al disappear so that Hugh Jackman can go stalk the suspect in peace. NONE of the residents in the town ever engage our characters. Despite having just had a VIGIL outside with a dozen plus people another suspect can get into not one, but BOTH of the kidnapped girl's homes!  Wow.  One would think after a kidnapping, a town would be totally on edge and report the SLIGHTEST suspicious thing right away.

One little girl gets away, but nobody asks her where her friend is or what the suspect looks like...they let her take a nap in the hospital?!?!?  Wow!

I could probably come up with a dozen more common sense errors. All the errors took me out of the connection with the characters.  It was like a cartoon to me where anything could and would happen.

Despite getting shot IN THE HEAD our detective thinks it's a good idea to drive the little girl to the ER, full speed, in the snow. Um...AMBULANCE ANYONE?

I mean, the initial suspect disappears, the detective knows the father is doing SOMETHING for long periods of time, but doesn't check other properties of the Father which would show the broken down house where he's keeping the suspect???

No other family members come to visit either family during their major crisis.

How major stars ever got attached to this is beyond me. This is an *incredibly* dumbed down drama.  I'm sad I paid 3.99 for this movie. :-(",1390089600,15,3358,4.5365448504983386
6071175,1,B00GBZVOEY,It was ridiculously hard to follow right up to the point where it was ridiculously predictable. (About half way through).,1390089600,,121,5.1
6071176,5,B00GBZVOEY,Special performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhal.  Subject matter is not appreciated by all. Exciting all the way to the end.,1390003200,,132,5.0

What would you do?",1390003200,,94,3.75
6071179,4,B00GBZVOEY,This movie is slightly long winded but is a good thriller. The acting is pretty good by the two main characters and the story is deceptive (in a good way).,1390003200,,155,4.2

6071184,1,B00GBZVOEY,"I hated this movie after wanting to like it. The storyline is not clear, there are numerous loose ends and the premise (which I won't mention because it would spoil the plot for others) very weak. Hated the acting, the scenery and the resolution. There are countless similar films from years ago that are much better (in the same category): the Pledge, Alphabet Killer and others. Don't waste 3 hours of your life on this bore.",1389916800,,427,4.631578947368421

Outwardly this movie seems a bit slow paced but really if you pay attention,  the movie is on the edge the whole time. I really reccomend putting the phone away,  close the laptop,  do away with any distractions because if you only half pay attention you are missing the underlying creepiness of this movie.",1389830400,,378,4.514705882352941

6071195,2,B00GBZVOEY,"I was looking forward to the movie based on the normal quality of the work by such actors as Jackman but....

I assume that the director was adhering to the written screenplay but that was actually the poor choice in the movie's rendition.

Normally, if there can ever be a ""normality"" associated with such a terrible event as a child abduction, the decent into the hell of panic, frustration and hate/revenge by the parents (Jackman, et. al.), would help to raise the clarity of the characters and their own failings and foibles. Not so in this case. Additionally, the characterization of the detective does not ""normally"" exacerbate the spiraling of the parents.

In this case, the writer decided to provide the audience with what I would characterize as ""snippets"" rather than a cohesive flow. These ""snippets"" may help pander to the grisliness of the ""reflective abduction and torture"" of the supposed child abductor and help to hold the audience in a tension centered around the choices we might make between what is right and wrong. However, it was at this point that the movie became tedious because once the characters were in this horrific dilemma the piece goes from ""searching"" to ""revenge"" to ""sadism"" in quick order.

Fortunately for writers in hollywood, they can merely construct a way out of the contrived dilemma by making the decision to wreak revenge, the actual right/wrong/right decision flow. This construct then leaves the movie with some needed way to reflect the ultimate karma on Jackman's character by placing him in a ""hole"" - literally! Moreover, the audience is then left hanging at the end of the movie with the detective looking wistfully into the night wondering why he is hearing a whistle at which time the screen goes to final credits.

Way too tedious (centering on the questions of right and wrong), and way too glib (centering on the ""superman"" capabilities of the abductors and the ""foolishness/bumbling"" of the everyman parents and detective). The movie production values cast by the dreariness of the Pennsylvania winter-scape does place a ""nice"" pall on the movie throughout, by-the-way. Having spent many a winter in Pennsylvania I can attest to the dreariness!

Child abductions will always be horrific and affected parents will always attempt anything they can in order to find their children but to make them ""mock"" revengers does a disservice to the real men and women who attempt to rectify real child abduction situations, in my opinion.

I finished the movie wondering why Jackman and the rest of the cast allowed themselves to be associated with the screenplay but I suppose money does the talking.",1389830400,,2650,5.009090909090909
6071196,4,B00GBZVOEY,This movie kept you on the edge of your seat.  It was suspenseful.  The acting was good.  The ending was terrific for some and disappointing to others.  It had a very unusual ending.  The violence was a little disturbing though.,1389830400,,228,4.6
6071197,2,B00GBZVOEY,S***ty ending.  Long drawn out surprise that wasn't that surprising.  Nothing on M. Knight.  I wouldnt ever watch it again.,1389830400,,123,5.05

The last couple of scenes had me literally screaming(and hands shaking) at the tv LOL. I need a drink after watching that.. yikes. Can't praise this enough. Hugh and Jake's best acting work by a country mile. In a just world this would win a bunch of oscars.... I thought Gravity was intense but that was Wallace and Gromit comared to this.

6071206,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is a movie about Keller Dover's (Hugh Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he decides to take matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts.

I actually didn't know what to expect about this movie as I hadn't seen the trailer or knew much about the movie at the time I rented but I did like the actors involved and decided to give this a shot.  And I for sure wasn't disappointed, this movie is an intense thriller that holds you by your heart the whole way through and throws in a morality play as part of the well though out plot and story.  Hugh Jackman does an excellent job at playing the distraught father who goes to all extremes to find his daughter.  My only criticisms about the movie is that it clocks a little long at over 2 hours and 32 minutes and the beginning is a bit slow.  However, the movie builds to an intensity and gives you many twists and turns that you forget that it is that long and started a bit slowly.  The ending also gives a bit of a twist that like the movie's title leaves everyone involved prisoners in one way or another.

An excellent movie that is worth watching, especially if you are a parent.",1389744000,3,1193,4.322869955156951

Hugh's performance seemed extreme but possible in a father who loses his youngest daughter. The other father was appalled at the actions taken by Hugh's character, but went along with it anyway, just in case. It made me feel sorry for the suspect.
The mother's were different in their reactions too. One pulls away from all life interaction, and the other tries to help find the girls.

(SPOILER WARNING)

The problems I had with the plot is as follows:
1) the mysterious pervert that the detective chased around was a red herring and was never fully tied to the lot or properly explained.
2) The main character demonstrated a flaw in character which is an error in scripting IMO.  He knew the mother was involved and he let the mother best him when he showed up at the jones house at the end?  Doesn't seem true to the character who was presented as well prepared and hyper vigilant giving the events.

6071248,3,B00GBZVOEY,"No spoiler review:

Good acting by most of the cast.  The lead detective does a great job. The film is well directed. There is nothing extraneous in the film to fill voids of time. There was not much money spent on building sets, but the story line requires middle class neighborhoods, houses, dens, bedrooms, kitchens. So much so, that it is a relief when action takes place outside.

It is a mystery with a lot of tension and suspense; and the clues are there if you can remember them when things begin to come together. It has a fair amount of action, and no gratuitous gore.

Biggest negatives: The premise is a bit far fetched and the reaction to tragedy is off the wall; not necessarily unusual in films of this genre.",1389484800,,724,4.462121212121212

I know of a lot of people who don't want to see it (my niece being one, because she's a new mom, and her daughter also named ""Anna.""  So I don't blame her in the least).  But I loved everything about this movie.  Hugh's performance was gripping, heart wrenching, powerful, and very believable!  I loved the scene with him, and ""Loki"" in the car.  You can feel Hugh's rage when he starts yelling and pounding on the dashboard.  That alone, should win him an Oscar.",1389484800,,545,4.38

I don't remember having as an intense feeling like this other than when I first watched Silence Of The Lambs. You know how ever DVD case has words in quotes on their movies to describe them, like ""Thrilling"", ""Riveting"", ""Edge-Of-Your-Seat"" and they turn out to be sub par at best? Well this is actually all those things. I felt like I had just been on a ride when I was done. Jake Gyllenhal was so good I can't even explain. Hugh Jackman was effective as the insane father. He often seems miscast (I;m thinking specifically of Wolverine), but he always steps up to the plate and delivers. Everyone is good and I realized believeability is what's missing in most suspense dramas that are made in The States. I watch a lot of British crime drama and they really have it right. This is a movie so it doesn't have as long to develop the characters, so it take you right into it very soon.

The story is poorly conceived and written, and far too long to be engaging.  Two terrible kidnappings occur, but you (as the audience) have zero chance of targeting a suspect -- and I think that is the height of shoddy workmanship.  If the film had some other element working for it, one might overlook the extremely boring aspects.  If you want to find an entertaining kidnapping movie, try ""Ransom"" or ""Man on Fire.""

The movie shows how crazy people are and to what extremes they may go to based on their personal spiritual motives and beliefs. Great movie for conversation as each character seems to have unresolved issues that go beyond the film on the screen.

6071284,5,B00GBZVOEY,"If you like Fritz Lang and wish for his spirit in current filmmaking, look no further.  This film is extremely Langian, from the unsavory heroes who only find their own smallness and helplessness, not their redemption, to the plot twists that are so jaw-droppingly unbelievable they can only exist as material evidence of a fatalism that is beyond capricious.  Also, let's not forget the ""mob mentality"" a la Fury.  This is a film that sets out to be about very disturbing things and manages to be genuinely disturbing, and yet so fascinating that you feel almost uplifted by the absolute clarity of vision.  What I like best are the things that are never explained -- the strange, almost Night of the Hunter-like tattoos that the Gyllenhaal character wears, or the whereabouts of certain missing characters.  In this film everyone's a missing person until proven otherwise.",1389225600,,874,5.0

Not your typical Hugh Jackman film so it was really outside of the box forhim and for me to see him act the way he did. Of course some twist and turns but nothing that will confuse you too much.

The movie begins innocuously enough at the beginning and then takes off, leading you on a dizzying ride. The storyline is very well thought out and very deep. The actors give some of the most moving and gut wrenching performances I've seen in quite some time. No spoilers, but just know that once you've figured it all out, you haven't. Also realize this a 2.5 hour movie, so make sure to devote some uninterrupted time to watch it. You won't want to break this one up in pieces.",1389139200,,603,4.392857142857143

6071331,2,B00GBZVOEY,"I am sorry I watched this film. Not a commentary on the film-making, but the subject matter; how the abduction of his daughter sucked all humanity from her father.",1389139200,,163,4.655172413793103
6071332,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Sacrifice is a common theme in Prisoners from the opening scene in the forest Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) recites a prayer while his son Ralph Dover (Dylan Minnette) kills his first deer to the climax where the kidnapper explains that god is the reason why he or she is doing what they are doing and the reasoning behind all the violence her or she has committed, and it both benefits and hurts Prisoners making it a gripping yet an overly long and flawed mystery thriller.

As with any good mystery thriller there has to be tension to keep the viewer guessing what will happen next, and suspense as to keep the viewer guessing as whom the murderer is, but first we must take a step back. Keller Dover is down on his luck carpenter whom is struggling, but still able to provide for his family. Keller a deeply spiritual man and his family head to his friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) home for Thanksgiving. The two families eat, drink and have fun until their daughters Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head off on their own, and never return to the Birch's home. With the tension rising as the parents call the police and search the neighborhood for the strange RV Ralph had spotted earlier, and this is where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes his appearance when he gets the call about the RV arresting Alex Jones (Paul Dano).

The tension and suspense really ratchets up in Prisoners from this point on as Loki and the CSI's find no evidence that Alex took the two girls, and is forced to let Alex go free yet Keller after a confrontation with Alex is sure the man knows where his daughter is and takes matters into his own hand. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski do a good job keeping up the drama and suspense as they keep hinting that Alex might be the kidnapper yet at the same time throwing in more suspects along the way to keep the viewer guessing until close to the end of the film. Besides the theme of sacrifice another theme Villeneuve and Guzikowski throw in a moral one as well, and try to get the viewer to understand Keller's decisions he has made like how far would you go to find your daughter, what sacrifices would you make to find your daughter, and for the majority of the film director Villeneuve and writer Guzikowiski succeed in doing so.

While I really enjoyed Prisoners I had some issues with the story, and the characters as well with the biggest issue being the climax of the film. You wanted to see if the parents were worth of god's love? I know I can't read the minds of serial killers and kidnappers, but the reasoning just didn't match the tone of the film, and where the story was headed. I expected a better thought out payoff than the one I got in Prisoners. Along with the reasoning behind the kidnapping leads to another issue I had with the final act of Prisoners in that the kidnapper could have easily gotten away with it if he or she had just answered the door for Loki. They had plenty of time to hide the evidence, and Loki had no reason or a warrant to search the home. That scene just took me out of what was supposed to be a tension filled scene. Finally there is the scene with Grace Dover (Maria Bello) and detective Loki where she explains that everything her husband did was justified and without him doing what he did Loki wouldn't have found their daughter, which is just crap. I can't believe the writers trying to justify what Keller did forced the character Grace to say that, and I know she's Keller's wife, but Grace can't honestly believe that even if she won't voice it out loud. It was simply laughable moment, because what Keller did was all for nothing. Nothing he did helped find his daughter in fact he was hindering the investigation as Loki had to look into the disappearance of Alex taking time away from searching for the missing children. Director Villeneuve and writer Guzikowiski nearly let everything they achieved in Prisoners fall apart in the final act with plot holes, poorly written dialogue, and out of character decisions made by certain characters. The other problem I had with the Prisoners was the length of the film. The film I watched didn't justify a length of two hours and a half. With some smart editing the film could have been cut down to around two hours and fifteen minutes, and I believe those cuts would have added to the tension and suspense of the film.

While the final act of Prisoners faltered the performances by the actors didn't. Hugh Jackman gives his best performance since the Prestige if not his career as Keller. The emotion Jackman gives to Keller brings to life the character and the decisions he has made, and the price Keller has paid making theme. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives an outstanding performance as Detective Loki who has chosen the job over having a family. Gyllenhaal really should stay away from the blockbuster films like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and the Day After Tomorrow, because Gyllenhall is a far better actor in dramatic roles than action roles as he has proven in Donnie Darko, End of Watch, and Brokeback Mountain. Maria Bello doesn't have much to do in Prisoners as the distraught Grace Dover, but she gives a believable performance as a mother who has lost her daughter cutting herself off from the outside world. Like Mario Bello, Terrence Howard doesn't have much to do in his role as Franklin Birch as he is relegated to Keller's accomplice, but the experienced actor Howard gives his all in the role displaying the conflicting emotions when is morality is tested as he helps Keller in his quest to find their daughters.

If not for the faulty final act, and climax Prisoners would go down as one of the great mystery thrillers like Memento, The Silence of the Lambs, and L.A. Confidential, but even with its flaws Prisoners is a riveting engrossing thriller with a quality moral story that will keep you guessing nearly to the end, outstanding performances by Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast that helps to turn Prisoners into enthralling, nerve-racking and thoughtful thriller, and one of the better films of the year.",1389052800,,6159,4.626142595978062

6071357,1,B00GBZVOEY,"This movie had everything to make it great, except for a cohesive plot.  The acting was first rate all throughout.  The movie fell flat from the moment things should have come together.  About half way through, I felt like there was likely going to be a big twist in the plot at the end.  The only twist turned out to be the fact that there was nothing but very thin possibilities and no punch what so ever.  A big waste of time.

6071364,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I think this movie was overlooked by a lot of critics because it's a thriller that sometimes has elements of a horror movie.  I loved the direction, acting, editing and cinematography of this film.  What the director chooses to show us and not show us creates suspense and leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer.  This movie might sound depressing, but it's not...actually it might have been a little too happy of an ending.  That being said, it is very disturbing and you will be thinking about it afterwards.  There is a few minor holes, mainly in the way that the police react to certain things, to help build dramatic scenes and thicken the plot, but I found these minor and overall it didn't take me out of the movie.  It's hard for me to think of any other films in 2013 that had an impact on me the way this one did.",1388966400,,830,4.32258064516129

6071366,4,B00GBZVOEY,"{4.25 stars}

Although a little more development in a few areas and a little less in others might have helped, PRISONERS will probably keep you watching and keep you guessing. Just an ultra-realistic, riveting film that will not end up exactly as you think it will. Nice use of subtle clues in the random bits of dialogue, written notes, and newspaper-flashes.

A number of sociological and religious themes can be delved from PRISONERS: How the families, police, perpetrators, and community-at-large are all made ""prisoners"" by this event; the dangers of preconceived notions about who, why, and how the crime was committed, etc. At the same time, it doesn't just bombard us with deep ulterior meanings, and those who prefer to watch it as a simple ""thriller"" may easily do so. Really fine all-around acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo give especially commendable performances.",1388966400,,883,5.1678321678321675

6071369,5,B00GBZVOEY,"As cliche as it sounds, it's true. The film was a mix of Silence Of The Lambs meets Zodiac. It's a long, gut wrenching journey of a movie, but worth it if you enjoy this genre. Very bleak and brutal at times, so be warned. All the actors did a fine job, I couldn't look away as the story grew more intense. Hugh Jackman is a beast of an actor, he steals the show here. I really believed what he was saying and doing. Not a false note about his performance. Oscar worthy in my opinion. Jake G. created an interesting character also. Though a tragic story, it does end on some positives which is nice to leave the viewer with.",1388966400,,624,4.1652892561983474

6071372,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a classic ""who dun it"" film. Very well done. Also surprising to see Hugh Jackman play this role. This film will twist you and turn you and in the end. . . . Well, I won't ruin it for you.",1388966400,,195,3.6666666666666665
6071373,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Kind of slow at first, but interesting characters. Unfortunately the performances couldn't counterbalance the predictable plot twists. Jackman and Gyllenhal give this film the momentum it needed to elevate it from just another Lifetime movie.",1388966400,,242,5.942857142857143
6071374,4,B00GBZVOEY,"The kidnap/mystery story (Jake Gyllenhall's part of the story) was clever but no better than any old Law&Order episode.  What made this movie special was the father's (Hugh Jackman's) trauma.  Here's this guy -- a strong man barely making a living for his family -- whose daughter is kidnapped.  He's supposed to leave it in the hands of the more competent professionals, but he just can't.  The vagaries of the law and the mixed cultural expectations upon him push him take the law into his own hands.  Of course, we've seen THAT story too, but this isn't the vigilante blazing his way through the bad guys; he's an intelligent man, but untrained and lacking the resources he needs to find his daughter, stumbling through every father's nightmare.  Really good stuff.

If you like this one, try David Schwimmer's disturbing ""Trust.""",1388966400,,833,4.9071428571428575

I fear that he will be overlooked for an Oscar nod.  Jake Gyllenhaal is also impressive.  I really think it is one of those films that grabs your attention from beginning to end and speaks of the desperate measures people will take in desperate times.  I really hurt for Jackman in this film and prayed for his salvation. He literally dug his own grave in this film.  Shout outs to Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello for their great performances as well. See this film and judge for yourselves.",1388880000,,648,4.591304347826087

6071397,2,B00GBZVOEY,"This struck me as an attempt to be a Coen brothers film that fell way short of the mark. The characters are largely two-dimensional and undeveloped. The long run time exceeds the story and is squandered upon dwelling on the maudlin.

Gyllenhaal plays a police detective investigating the disappearance of two young girls. You learn very little about him, except that he's somewhat oblivious to clues. He has a stereotype relationship with his stereotype harried boss.

Of the two sets of parents, one father receives a dollup of character development. The other three are relegated to props. The plot does contain some twists but suffers from gaps and omissions.

The actors do a pretty good job with what they're given to work with. But, that isn't much and the weaknesses become more strident as the movie plods through its excessive length.",1388880000,,843,4.964539007092198

The fact that too many abductions are still happening in our society is a shame. In this movie all the elements of a good story are present and unfold very well. I found out who the culprit was or at least suspected it 3/4 of the way into the movie. Nevertheless it kept my attention all the way to the end. The ending was okay but almost expected.

I almost gave up & didn't watch at all.  When the movie finally decided to play, I enjoyed it. Great acting. Disturbing subject & the ending was a What?!

6071433,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a film that might inspire the thought ""What Would You Do?"" when dealing with the apparent abduction of a child.
Hugh Jackman,as the parent,  goes ""off the deep end"" in a very unusual role for him.  Although Jake Gyllenhaal also plays a significant part as a policeman investigating the disappearance, Jackman is definitely the key character in the evolving plot. The twists and turns which occur as the film progresses toward a payoff are unexpected and make this one that will remain with you for days afterward.",1388793600,,521,4.842696629213483

6071450,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I thought this movie was pretty suspenseful, and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Another thing that it did that I liked a lot is that some of the characters genuinely gave me a feeling of creepiness. I think the roles were acted pretty well by those who were the accused in the movie. The other actors could have shown more range in their characters. Their primary focus was on communicating the difficulty of their circumstance, but a more believable and adoring character will show you more sides of their personality. The only other complaint that I have is that the antagonist at the end was a bit out there and not really believable. I don't think it ruined the movie and there was still some suspense, but it didn't give me that full gratification of seeing a nicely composed thriller. I'd recommend this movie, though. It's perfect for rental.",1388793600,,864,4.616883116883117

6071461,5,B00GBZVOEY,"First and foremost the writing was top notch and the director knew exactly how to film it.

However the performances are what made this film so amazing. The best, Hugh Jackman. This is a actor who deserved an Oscar a long time ago and if he doesn't even get a ""nod"" for this film, well he may never win an Oscar. As for the rest of the cast everyone else was also in the top of their game and should be recognized for it. If you are into mystery/thrillers this film is for you, it is an intense ride and is worth multiple viewings if nothing else to watch the amazing performances/cinematography.

4.5/5  Stars.",1388707200,,611,4.342105263157895
6071462,3,B00GBZVOEY,"The cinematography alone would have made me give it a high rating, because it sets the bleak tone and the cold, raw atmosphere of the film so beautifully. The script was suspenseful [ I actually had to close my eyes during some frightening parts] and had some nice twists and turns.

Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the policeman, Loki,  was wonderful. His background was just hinted at, a youth spent at a boys' home, but his lack of affect, impenetrable solitude and street tattoos spoke volumes. Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Maria Bello were fine though a bit underutilized in smaller roles, and Paul Dano was credible as the suspect in a Thanksgiving kidnapping.

However, the character played by Hugh Jackman was so cliched and over the top, that for me, the movie was marred by it [and  I am  a Northern urban dweller, neither Christian nor right wing].  One the one hand, I'm happy the otherwise talented screenwriter broke through to the big time and is now living his dream, on the other, his depiction of  a ' redneck ' father who becomes a vigilante and takes justice into his own hands is stereotypically New York/ Hollywoodish : a snarling, deer hunting survivalist upholder of the second amendment, who is drunk, violent and prays before committing heinous acts.

The motivation for the latter day gun toting Bloody Mama - waging a war on God to make parents lose their faith is fairly absurd [ generally people who kidnap and kill children have far more heinous motivations]  and the dog torturing intellectually disabled suspect is named Alex Jones, like the conspiracy mongering talk show host,  which should give you a clue where the scriptwriter is coming from.

Consequently, the movie, which was set up as a moral examination of the events depicted, falls short of that goal and becomes more of a twisty -turn scare fest.  Personally, I preferred The Changeling and Gone Baby Gone which are far more penetrating and chilling.",1388707200,2,1951,4.861027190332326
6071463,5,B00GBZVOEY,I will not say much except that I am picky about movies.  This movie is mysterious in many ways and it captivated me.  It is quite long and I didn't mind that at all.  The acting is superb.,1388707200,,189,3.9210526315789473

6071470,5,B00GBZVOEY,"This is one of the most moving and powerful films I have seen in a long time. This film grabbed me by the throat and never let go. This is  movie making at it's most dramatic and breathtaking. Like films of the past with a similar style and story such as Zodiac and Seven, it's the stuff legends are made of. At the time I am writing this, the Oscar contenders have not yet been announced. That being said, it would be a miracle if this film is not nominated for numerous Oscars and does not win. everything about this movie is top notch, the direction is superb, the pace is electrifying, the music is foreboding and haunting. And most of all the acting is incredible. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that has to be seen to be believed. I predict he will be nominated for best actor and likely will win the Oscar. Performances this intense, believable and this raw and lifelike are rare in cinema. This is a performance of a lifetime. I'm simply astonished at Jackman's performance. And Terrence Howard also turns in what I think is the best performance of his career. I have never much cared for him all that much until now. In fact I always find him rather annoying. I don't know why. But I have a refreshed opinion of Howard after seeing this movie. His performance here is brilliant. It's understated and to his credit it is absolutely beautiful acting. One of the best supporting performances I have ever seen. This movie never goes where you expect and never ends up where you think it will. The mood of the film is grim and haunting. It never let go of me and sucked me in until the very end. It's been awhile since I have been this enthralled with any movie no matter what the genre. Prisoners is a fine example of edge of your seat master film making, and one of spine tingling suspense. If it doesn't make the list of best picture contenders this year it would certainly be a crime. This is one fantastic ride, made with passion and real skill. Not to be missed.",1388707200,,1974,4.39344262295082

6071476,4,B00GBZVOEY,We never know what we are capable of until we are put in a position to choose. This movie is about not judging what other people are capable & their abilities.

Lots of the negative reviews pertain to the ending, but these people apparently did not pay attention to the theme of faith in the movie or there would be no cause for complaint.

However...I waited for the plot to draw me in, waited, and waited some more. It's a little too long, but if you're a patient movie viewer, the second half is worth the wait. I recommend this film, not 4 stars, 3.5 tops. Enjoy.",1388620800,,390,4.835820895522388

6071493,5,B00GBZVOEY,"So the movie was very good. Captivating, thrilling, engaging, and eerie. Everything I expected and more without a doubt. Kind of intense for those of you that have young children, and makes you think about what you would do if your child disappeared. Defiantly worth watching!",1388620800,,276,5.021739130434782

6071495,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a dark twisted movie. The trailer is slightly misleading though, only slightly. It's not as much about the kidnapping as it is about a man's morals and values and how much he is willing to abandon those morals and values in order to find the most precious thing in his life, his child. Everyone in the cast especially Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhal, and Terrence Howard did a fantastic job. I am also eager to see more of the actor who played the son, Dylan Minnette. He was great in this role as well as in 'Awake' with Jason Isaacs. That kid has a bright future. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the ending. Those type of endings have their place but with this movie it just doesn't fit.",1388620800,,698,4.295454545454546

6071497,3,B00GBZVOEY,"I liked this movie butit went on way too long. Tightening up the convoluted plot and shortening the movie by about thirty minutes would have made it a suspenseful story. Hugh Jackman's acting was outstanding as the dad out to find his daughter. But Jake Gyllenhaal as the cop disappointed me. Maybe if there had been some back story about his character, but there wasn't. And I wasn't satisfied with the ending. The movie was already so long, they could have added another five minutes and given us a real ending.",1388620800,,513,4.648351648351649

Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are just incredible actors. I can't imagine how they must have felt everyday after filming. Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano, is a character I will NEVER forget. I wish I could. I won't watch it again. It affected me like the movie ""In the Bedroom."" The story is well done but I don't need to think about these kinds of real life situations.

6071502,5,B00GBZVOEY,The run time for this movie is 2hrs and 25mins - not for your average ADHD pop culture instant gratification consumer.  More thought went into this movie.  Probably not the best mystery/thriller of all time but this movie was refreshingly entertaining - a welcome break from the usual predictable dribble that is pushed out by the Tinseltown pimps. Fast and Furious ? One of the worst series to brainwash our dull witted masses.,1388534400,2,428,4.8493150684931505
6071503,5,B00GBZVOEY,This movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. The story line was mysterious and smart & the acting was top-notch to boot. You won't be disappointed in this film.

6071504,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I haven't seen Hugh Jackman perform with such intensity, though I haven't seen all his movies.  But I can't imagine how any of them  could have showed a heartbreaking helplessness to find his daughter, his ability to commit a criminal act to find the answer. He totally ignores his son and wife, who are also suffering from the kidnapping of the child.  If fact, every performance in that movie was superb. I highly recommend this for adult viewing. For the sensitive, a warning: it is really tough to watch. I found myself clutching the arms of the chair.",1388534400,,556,4.653061224489796

I think the plot could be covered with full understanding, without adding more disturbing images.  The biggest plus of the movie was Hugh Jackman's acting.  Every parent can relate to the many emotions he portrayed, however radical it may seem.  I'm still torn whether I'd recommend this movie to others.",1388534400,,400,4.753623188405797
6071507,1,B00GBZVOEY,"This could have been a terrific movie - the premise was a good one; the makers had a lot to work with. And then.... they totally botched it by confusing and convoluting the culprits, their motives and their involvement. And, inexplicably, the movie stops just before the end of the story is told, leaving the viewer to guess as to what may have happened. But it wasn't a Jason Bourne type of question mark at the end, it was more of a ""what the hell?"" type question mark. A complete waste of time.",1388534400,14,497,4.354838709677419
6071508,1,B00GBZVOEY,"It was graphic and horrible. It's my opinion that not one of the characters acted within character. The mothers didn't respond like any mother I know would. The fathers started out acting like they should but quickly went nuts. The cop did so many unorthodox things, completely out of character for any cop I know. I could only watch the first hour before I had to turn it off because of the torture aspects that, at least to me, were leading no where. I don't guess I can ask for a refund for a truly horrible movie... It's my responsibility to read the reviews first. I hated this movie. I probably won't watch another movie for a long time based on the horror of having seen 1/3 of this one.",1388534400,3,694,4.346153846153846

6071511,2,B00GBZVOEY,"The movie started out good but then had a long part of not much happening and I had to get up a few times because it just kept losing my interest.  I eventually finished the movie and it does have a surprise twist in the end.  It's an ok movie but be warned it is one of those annoying movies that doesn't finish, it just ends right in the middle of something and you have to assume something happened or make up your own ending to it.  Personally I think movies like that should have a warning because I would never watch them.  I need a conclusion to a movie after all that time vested into watching it.",1388534400,5,605,4.101694915254237
6071512,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is likely one of those films that you'll want to watch more than once.  The ending took me completely by surprise, and before we find out who the Big Bad is, there are a number of red herrings thrown in our path.  On my second viewing, I was happy to see that the ending held up, and the clues, which I'd managed to overlook, were there all along.

Prisoners is a dark story that covers many unpleasant topics: child abduction, pedophilia, and vigilante justice.  When two young girls disappear, the abductor seems clear: the creepy, mute guy, hanging out in a van nearby.  He's quickly captured by the police, but they don't have enough evidence to hold him.  Hugh Jackman, as one of the fathers, decides to take matters into his own hands.  He kidnaps and tortures the suspect, desperate for information.  Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, playing the parents of the other girl, are a bit more conflicted, but they're reluctant to stand in Jackman's way.  Jake Gyllenhall is excellent as the detective who keeps more of an open mind about the potential suspect, even while he remains unaware of Jackman's actions.

A lot of people watching this film may wonder if they'd go to the same extremes as Jackman.  If he's right in his assumptions about the suspect, it may be hard to fault him.  But if he's wrong, his actions are monstrous.",1388534400,,1346,4.656779661016949

6071514,3,B00GBZVOEY,"I could not at first put my finger on why this movie didn't fly with me, until later, when I realized it had two leading men and could not decide who was the top gun.  The movie is about two families celebrating Thanksgiving who suddenly realize their little girls are gone.  An older son had seen them playing near an old RV, with someone in it, earlier in the evening.  The father of one girl is convinced the damaged mental young man whom the police find driving the RV, is the culprit, even though the police, including the lead detective, who has never not solved a case, dismiss the notion and release him.  The lead detective and the one volatile violent father are the ""leading men"", given about equal time.  The problem I see with the movie is that the audience is quickly given information that the father is correct in believing the young man with the RV is involved.  I spent the whole movie cursing at the lead detective, who has to go all over and around and finally back to the original RV guy and his mother.  The father takes drastic and violent measures, kidnapping and torturing the RV man, in grotesque manners, to try to get him to talk.  The movie is far too disjointed for me to enjoy.  The plot beneath however is relatively simplistic.  I gave it three stars to be nice.  It deserves only two.",1388534400,,1318,4.427385892116183

6071521,1,B00GBZVOEY,"I fail to see how a movie staring such great actors, with such an interesting storyline could come out so poorly.  They never made us care about the kidnapped girls, if anything they are treated as an afterthought.  It is hard to inform on how awful this movie is without giving away key plot points; so I will just say no one in their right mind would act like the people in this movie, not the families, not the police, not the priest.  No one would be so foolish or careless.  Nor would things tidy up like they did at the end.

6071534,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Denis Villeneuves Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, its just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.

The film stars Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over-exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldnt exist like, What is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners? Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.

The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls absence is noticed, its too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.

This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Kellers (Jackmans) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, belivable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.

The actual visual experience of Villeneuves films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuves commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.

Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. Theres not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.

The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dovers untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.

6071535,1,B00GBZVOEY,Dumbest movie ever. The characters make no sense and are never developed. The story is lame and the ending is horrible!,1388448000,,119,4.714285714285714

6071537,3,B00GBZVOEY,"this film is very typical compared to other kidnapping movies. if it were not for the scenes were Hugh Jackman and Terence Howard (fathers of the two missing girls) torture and brutally beat the suspected retarded kid who was the last to see them, it would almost be exactly like a majority of other kidnapping movies.  But surprisingly,  the plot does thicken (as they say) and Jackman continues to shine when he does some investigating on his own and decides to go to the house where the retarded kid lives to talk to the lady that also lives there. He seems unsatisfied after talking to her though and knows she is hiding something and cant be trusted.  He then returns for a second visit to the house, where the plot gives us a surprising twist and Jackman becomes a hostage himself!
the other stand-out performance is given to us by Jake G., who plays the cool tempered ever-persistent detective (who comes equipped with excellent instincts) investigating the case. throughout the film he is annoyed by a fumbling police chief and people who want to tell him how to do his job. he draws us in as he pursues the leads and clues. Frustrated with bad results and no solid leads, WE follow Jake G. to the house where Jackman was last scene and he engages the woman living there in an intense bloody scene where he gets a nasty blow to the head that leaves him loopy and disoriented, he nonetheless forces himself to keep going and finds the missing girl(who has been drugged heavily and is unconscious), bleeding profusely and knocked silly he then picks her up and runs to his patrol and throws her in the back, he knows he has to get her to the the hospital as fast as possible and he races through traffic driving like a madman wiping blood from his eyes the whole way barely holding on to consciousness himself trying to save the little girl!  these scenes are some of the best the movie has to offer, delivering on the suspense, tension, and emotions as mother and little girl are finally reunited. but we are left wandering what happened to Jackman who is now missing.  we follow the freshly bandaged up Jake G. whose instincts are  in high gear now as he begins searching for the missing father and we return (yet again) to the house where Jackman was last seen.  he looks around for a while and we hear the sound of a whistle (which was left by his daughter when she was a captive in the same hole) and then.....nothing...that's it!
this ending is obvious, we know he is going to find the missing Jackman, but the suspense is not comparable to the other scenes in the movie as we are left hanging!  the movie for the most part is great, but the ending is a dud, and it leaves you disappointed wanting something more!",1388448000,,2725,4.490909090909091
6071538,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is a 2013 thriller directed by the gifted Denis Villeneuve. The films cast includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano.  Powered by an unusually rich, twisty script by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) and career-best performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal.  This is the tale of two Pennsylvania families searching for their kidnapped daughters.  The plot focuses on the abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the search to find them.  But the abduction is only the beginning of the movie.  The movie is shot beautifully and adds to the almost unbearable tension for two-and-a-half hours of the screen time.  The movie had me standing for whole second half.  This movie is the kind of adult drama of the sort Hollywood almost never makes anymore.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.

I like it when a movie creates tension and suspense through the storytelling, rather than laying blatant props, flashback scenes, or forced dialogue to try and lead the audience somewhere else because the screenplay was poorly written or executed.

I don't recommend this for kids - even with supervision - because it challenges our moral compass in a way that only an adult might fully understand.

The cast did their best to carry the story forward, but there were so many holes in the story and some of the key characters had no back story which could have made a difference in the continuity and transitional scenes.

6071565,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Nine things about Prisoners

1. This is a dark psychological thriller about two girls who are kidnapped.

2. It starts off like one of those typical I must find my daughter! films. I was afraid it would be boring.

3. It eventually turns out to be closer to Silence of the Lambs. It wasn't even close to being boring.

4. Hugh Jackman plays one of the fathers and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective. Each of them follows different leads to find the girls, with different results. The audience is left to decide for themselves which man  if either of them  is doing the right thing.

5. Ive always been a fan of Gyllenhaal, and he is right on point here. Hes intense, layered, and commands the screen every time hes on.

6. Ive always been kind of meh about Jackman, but he surprised me with this. He has a fiercely raw emotion that makes you believe the lengths to which hell go to find his daughter. This is the best, most mature role Ive ever seen him in.

7. The movie is almost two-and-a-half hours long, which gives plenty of time for the story and characters to marinate and come together. It repeatedly takes turns that I wasn't expecting.

8. It is well written, not only as a thriller, but as a psychological examination of two complicated men and the demons who drive them.

9. It was originally rated NC-17 for being extremely violent. It was edited down to get an R-rating, but its still disturbing.",1388361600,,1412,4.4765625

Without giving away the plot, from the moment in which the movie starts until it ends, the producers garbs your attention by opening with a doubt, continues with an acceleration of adrenaline, and ends with the most surprising ending. While I usually do not watch long movies, this one is over two hours long, I must say that it seems quite short - the time just flew wondering where would the movie take me next. Besides that, the photography and the camera plays an excellent role by placing ideas which makes the watcher ponder on what might happen next.

It was a real shock and surprise to see the retarded villian's mother as the evil maniac deranged by what she thought God had done to her and her family. Truly evil and well portrayed by that actress, which in my view should qualify her for a 'best supporting "" consideration. I have some minor criticisms;;such as I would like to have seen more development of the connection between the '2 crazy brothers who had been abused and warped by the insane bitch that was their foster mother who had kidnapped them as children.;;;But all in all the movie reminded me of a great ""Hitchcock"" thriller.",1388275200,,918,4.536144578313253

What I got, wondrously, was a terrifically surprising soul wrenching and a soaringly aching slab of brilliance!

This movie tackles an extremely sensitive subject matter expertly and respectively. It is also a technical achievement regarding story-telling, movie-making, and acting in general. It is a movie without any glaring flaw whatsoever. The acting is phenomenal across the board. No weak links. The story is artfully crafted, and masterfully paced. I could go on and on about it.
This is an elite film. It's relevance and emotional delivery, combined with near-perfect execution of the movie-making craft, place this film among the highest echelon. Think Schindler's List. Think Munich. Just brace yourself. It isn't an easy experience the first time through.",1388188800,,929,5.0

6071600,4,B00GBZVOEY,I thought this was a great movie that gives viewers awareness of their children whereabouts and how crazy people are in the world.

6071604,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Premis great, great writing with a great cast yet one setback: a case of, ""decent to solid to great Acting... and the great Acting was done by one Actor alone, that of the Co-Star, the real deal JAKE GYLLENHAAL!!!

Even with an ensemble of high calibre Actors it would have been a tedious heavy watch without GYLLENHAAL. From the decent but perplexing performances by Howard, Bello and to my high surprise Jackman to 3 solid as always, needed performances by Davis, Leo and Dano to the GREAT performance of, which is now his 2nd demonstration of the true craft of acting, JAKE GYLLENHAAL!!!

While Jackman never ceases to amaze us his performance was overplayed and pushed drama while on the opposite end of the spectrum Howard and Bello both dove into underplayed drama. Holding these performances afloat only long enough to take a deep breath were the solid performances of Dano, Davis and Leo. As always, Viola and Leo were pitch perfect adding just enough diversion.

BUT THE CAT WHOM KEPT THIS FILM ALIVE, STEADY AND MORE THAN WORTH THE WAIT, FOR ONE OF THE BEST WRITTEN ENDINGS TO A FILM, IS GYLLENHAAL. EVEN WITH DANO DAVIS AND LEO THIS FILM WOULD HAVE FALLEN SLOWLY INTO A DEEP DARK HOLE OF DEPRESSION RATHER THAN A WELL WRITTEN TRAGEDY IF NOT FOR GYLLENHAAL.

BY FAR THE BEST PEFORMANCE IN THIS FILM LIFTING IT FROM BEING HELD AFLOAT TO FLAT OUT SOURING WAS GIVEN BY GYLLENHAAL. A SILENT FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH, GYLLENHAAL'S CHOICES WERE SUBLIMELY SUBTLE YET BREATHTAKING, FIST CLENCHING AND GUTTERALY HEARTBREAKING CREATING AN UTTERLY MEMORIZING PERFORMANCE. ALL DUE TO GYLLENHAAL'S CONVICTION TO THIS DETECTIVE'S INNER TURMOIL SITTING IN A SELF STRUCTURED PRISON!

GYLLENHAAL MARKED TERRITORY THROUGHOUT THIS FILM SO MUCH SO YOU ALMOST FORGET ABOUT ANYONE ELSE INCLUDING THE LOST GIRLS AND HE DOES SO WITHOUT TAKING FROM THE OTHER ACTORS NOR THE WRITING - THE CAT SIMPLY IMBEDDED HIMSELF IN THE CANVAS OF THIS FILM USING THE CRAFT TO PERFECTION CREATING HIS CHARACTER - WHAT MADE ME BUY THE FILM WAS JAKE AND HE ALONE COMPELLS ME TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN - FROM THE MOMENT HE APPEARS ON SCREEN ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS, WHO THIS DETECTIVE? IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? WHAT GAVE HIM THE ABILITY, THE DRIVE, THE PATIENCE TO CRACK EVERY CASE...?  LEAVING US BEGGING THE WRITER TO TELL US JUST SOMETHING, ANYTHING - OF THE WRITER DESERVES SERIOUS CREDIT AS WELL MAINLY FOR CREATING GYLLENHAAL'S ROLE.

THE TITLE IS ""PRISONERS"" BUT THE TITLE SHOULD BE ""PRISONER"" BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE PRISONER IN THIS FILM, THE DETECTIVE JAKE GYLLENHAAL!

GYLLENHAAL SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR THIS PERFORMANCE - I PRAY HE DOES - WHERE HAS THIS JAKE BEEN?  I DONT KNOW BUT JAKE IS HERE NOW! THE CRAFT OF ACTING NEEDS HIM, FILM NEEDS HIM AND WE NEED HIM. FILMMAKERS, DIRECTORS, WRITERS AND PRODUCERS NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AND GRAB THIS CAT WHILE THEY CAN!!!

From my perspective of the preview I believed there was going to be a lot more action and confrontations between enemies. There are things you have to pay close attention to, to understand parts, but even if you don't, Hugh Jackman's character will do sort of a recap near the end and everything will be understood. The way it ended kinda upsets me because it's one of those endings where you can think ""ok that's all, there won't be a sequel"" or you can think ""oh man, why did you do that me, now I have to anxiously wait for the sequel"".

6071627,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I saw this film in theatres, when it first came out. It was amazing!! My sister got this dvd for me for Christmas, and I loved watching it again!

The bonus features were a bit disappointing...I guess since I'm a film junkie I was hoping for behind-the-scenes B-roll footage or something, but otherwise, they were good. Basically, the features held interviews with the cast, and how they prepared for their roles, etc.

If you've never seen this movie, here's a bit of a rundown about content: It's violent and there's a lot of language. The violence can be disturbing, but it's realistic. The language is not gratuitous; it's real life. F word is used quite a lot.

Hugh Jackman is incredible in this film. The emotion he brings to the character is astounding. Likewise, I've never enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal more than in this movie! The entire cast is phenomenal. The shots used, in junction with the lighting and music (which is epic & fitting), make for a fantastic film. The script alone is incredible.

6071634,3,B00GBZVOEY,"I would have given this five stars had they not ended it like that. Of course you assume that he gets him out of the hole and he goes to jail after being rescued, but for me the whole movie was about a father doing anything it takes to find his daughter, and there is no shot of them ever being reunited? Of course again you assume they were but ending with the whistle and not ever seeing any of that totally robs the audience of closure. The Directors got it wrong.",1388016000,3,467,4.086956521739131

Most releases this year have been dissapointing, with only a few good movies here and there that are worth watching. Hugh jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, viola davis, terrence jackson are superb in their roles.

Movies are for entertainment: I use my brain all day  at work and come home wanting to turn the brain off, this is entertaining and i didn't have to think too much watching this movie. So sit back, turn off the brain and enjoy. I would recommend watching this movie with no expectations and im sure you will enjoy.",1388016000,,610,4.536363636363636

6071640,2,B00GBZVOEY,This movie was way too long in running time for what was pretty much a short story.  Lots of slow sections with tedious dialog and action scenes were more violence than needed to transmit the story.  Glad we paid the $4.00 after market price rather than on the big screen.

Also, I have a young child and was avoiding this film as I felt it would be hard for me emotionally to watch.  It was (difficult to stomach at times), but the film makes efforts to tread lightly around the abduction, and no terrorization, violence, pain, etc. involving children was shown or explicitly referenced.  The best acting in either Jackman's or Gyllenhall's careers...Oscar level output for both, it will be a shame if at least a nomination doesn't come.  Clever writing, plot twists, and general creepiness will keep you glued.",1388016000,,664,4.7894736842105265

Even though its almost two and a half hours, the time flies by and you don't really notice it - because you are so engrossed in the mystery every second of it.

6071656,2,B00GBZVOEY,"Practically nothing about Hugh Jackman's character is believable. Cliches stacked on cliche mixed with  reactions that no human would ever have, that can only live on paper, in a script. Although I must say that the photography indeed is very nice, props are  sometimes a little too over-explaining. For example, is it really necessary to show 10 or so semi emptied empty liquor bottles in someones home to establish that the guy living there is a drunk? Yes, one bottle was tilted also.

The movie moves slooow. Save your money and time.",1387929600,2,538,4.826086956521739

6071661,4,B00GBZVOEY,Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhall were great in these roles. The rage of a father & frustration of a detective filled every scene. A definite must watch if you enjoy thrillers.,1387929600,,173,4.612903225806452

6071664,1,B00GBZVOEY,This could have been a good movie if the editors of the film would have watched it first. The scenes would go from rain to snow on the ground back to rain  yet this represented a 3 hour window in the movie. They made a point of calling out certain things in a scene (like the phone in the garbage disposal) and then never came back to it. Hugh Jackman does a good job and is believe able as a grief stricken father who would do anything to find his daughter. Jake Gyllenhaal is less convincing as the detective investigating.,1387929600,4,525,4.25
6071665,2,B00GBZVOEY,"This was one of the most unrealistic and boring movies that I've seen. I could not get past the first 30 minutes. After seeing the star studded cast of academy award nominees, my expectation level was high. Unfortunately, the script and pace of the movie was not worthy of the talents of this extraordinary cast. Hopefully, the cast will have an opportunity to work together again in the future on something that meets their level of talent.",1387929600,,441,4.740259740259741
6071666,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I thought the movie itself was just okay, but thought the acting was spot on.  Not the prettiest parts for Hugh and Jake, but they play the seedy side very well.  The storyline itself intriguing, but the last half hour could have been screened better.  Where was his truck?",1387929600,,273,4.530612244897959
6071667,2,B00GBZVOEY,"The movie starts out with great promise.  Prisoners has some entertainment value with its cast of stars.  It's not their fault that they didn't write an implausible script.  Jake Gylenhal (sp) always delivers in his films.  But this movie played out like a typical horror movie in which you are yelling at the characters to grow a brain.  The movie plays out almost 40 mins. too long.  It's like the director started the project, was insecure, and tried to explain everything at the end to wrap it up nicely.  Overall, the suspense and darkness keeps a nice mood throughout the movie.  But the inexplicable moves of the characters makes them just dumb and with no redeeming qualities.  If you just want a movie to escape than Prisoners is the movie for you.  But if you're like me that sets the bar with the Coen bros., than this movie will insult your intelligence.  Happy movie watching over the holidays!

This was a really good movie, very well done.  It kept our attention to the very end.

6071706,5,B00GBZVOEY,"From start to finish this movie will keep you engaged as to what happened, who done it, and what will happen. Great acting, direction, and story line. Very rarely is a movie that is actually realistic and remains entertaining. The story-line and characters kept you wanting to know more and while it was over 2 hours long, there was never a dull moment. It did a great job at making you think a situation was going to be a minor part of the story, but then it completely turns into an important element/event in the story. The ending will definitely be a ""good"" surprise/twist, but is very realistic. My fiance and I went back and rewatched some scenes after the movie that ended up being important details to the case.

Although, I can't say enough good things about this movie, but I will say this; While it's not very gruesome or at all sexual, It's not something I'd recommend for pre-teen children or people who find child abduction stories particularly distiburbing. The movie will surpise you at how likely something like this could happen (has happened), so don't watch it if you can't appreciate it for what it is. Again, I can't say enough good things about this movie, so I highly recommend giving it a chance.",1387670400,8,1221,4.626728110599078

6071714,5,B00GBZVOEY,"It was great to see Hugh Jackman embrace a part that didn't require he growl or mince about. He made a conservative Christian survivalist a sympathetic character - not the easiest job in this culture.
Jake Gyllenhaal is so interesting. The older he gets the better he gets. There was clearly a huge back story to the cop he played and it was used skillfully to add to the present movie not distract from it. From the tattoos to the facial ticks, this mat be his best acting job ever.
I love it when actors get their teeth in and really master a character to the point that we BELIEVE everything that is happening on screen. Nice work. SO imagine my fear when I saw that Maria bello was in this film. I was scared that I was going to have to watch her version of bullish post feminism that she brings to nearly every role she plays. Not a subtle actress at all.
BOY, WAS I WRONG!!!
She played the broken betrayed wife with such sympathy that I nearly cried when she did and I ached for her loss and confusion at the loss of her daughter. Really nice work!
Finally, without giving anything away, Kudos to the director or writer or who ever thought up the ending: Grand and electrifying subtlety, simply brilliant.

Hugh Jackman is one of a kind and even though the movie is over 2 hours, it does a very, very good job of telling the entire story.  At first it seems like you are going to walk your way through this movie, especially if you have seen other movies with the same subject matter, but that is not the case.

Not knowing how the movie is going to end is a hard element to get into a movie these days when everything has been done.  This one really makes you feel for the main characters as they are ALL put into very tough situations throughout.

The movie is engaging, suspenseful, and has an original perspective on the kidnapping genre.  I imagine this movie is significantly more compelling to folks with kids or who have some that are very close to them.

It is complex enough to keep you from figuring it out until it unfolds on the screen but, doesn't take too many leaps to make it unbelievable.

Finally, the movie is an interesting guide through the topic of whether torture is ever justified.  Purchase/rent with confidence and get ready for a really solid thriller.",1387584000,,580,4.938144329896907

6071723,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is yet another installment in the crime/abduction movie genre starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Prisoners is not really my type of movie.  Im not generally into crime dramas whether it be crime/abduction movies or the few dozen crime dramas on television like CSI, Criminal Minds, NCIS, Law and Order, etc.  I would not have seen this film had it not have starred Hugh Jackman or Jake Gyllenhaal.

I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman.  He is the perfect Wolverine.  No one could have played Wolverine better.  I have also seen many of his other films as well like the Fountain, Les Miserable, Real Steel, etc.  While some of his movies I do not care for like the Fountain, I still loved his performance in them.  He is a very talented actor and deserves an Oscar at this point.  Hopefully he gets one for his performance in this film.  I also like Gyllenhaal as an actor.  I thought he was good in the Day After Tomorrow and I thought he was great in Zodiac.  Without these two this movie would not have been as good.  They were both amazing in this film.

I knew the film would at least be decent because those two actors were in it and the film is getting pretty good reviews so far on Rotten Tomatoes.  I saw the film and I liked it.  I will say that out of all the crime drama films that I have seen I would that this is one of the better ones.  It is well acted by everyone in the cast, not just by Jackman and Gyllenhaal.  The story was also good and fairly well executed.  I will also admit that this film does something a little bit different than most crime dramas that I have seen.

The story is fairly simple.  It is very much like it was advertised in the trailers.  You have two families.  One family consists of a man named Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Gracie Dover (Maria Bello), his son Ralph, and his daughter Anna.  The other family consists of a man named Franklin (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), his eldest daughter Eliza, and the youngest daughter Joy.  The two children, Anna and Joy, end up being abducted by an unknown individual.  An investigator named Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to investigate the case.  They have the primary suspect named Alex in custody.  However, they cannot find anything on him and release him.  Dover obsessed with getting his daughter back and takes the law into his own hands.

The movie is very good, but it is not a movie that can be watched casually.  It is very depressing and does not end the best.  The characters do some pretty messed up things that make you like them less, but you do see where they are coming from.  This movie is very much like films like the Departed, Seven, Gone Baby Gone, Mystic River, etc.  They are well-done films, but they leave you depressed and are not films you can really re-watch.  I do like prisoners more than most of those films though.

This film at least did not have an entirely depressing ending.  It is not really a happy ending, but more bittersweet.  To be honest that is really the only way this movie could have ended though.  I usually prefer triumphant endings, but this one could not really end happily.  From what occurs in the movie and certain actions the main character takes, if the film ended happily it would have felt like a cop out.

Overall, Prisoners is a well-done crime drama.  I will say that this, Zodiac, and The Dark Knight (yes I count it as a crime drama) are my favorite films in this particular genre.  It is well-acted well plotted and well executed.  If you like crime dramas then give this a look.",1387584000,,3565,4.433641975308642

6071734,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Jackman and Gyllenhaal should work together often as they generate a plausible degree of friction and suspense that grips the viewer from the beginning and does not let go.  Oscar-worthy work from both, although I doubt they'll actually be nominated, since - as usual - the people who determine who is nominated for stellar performances are too busy jumping on the latest bandwagon to actually compare apples to apples.  Sorry - awards season always annoys me to no end. :)

As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal is a revelation in that he seems to have deliberately abandoned any suggestion of ""just another pretty Hollywood face"" and poured himself into the role. Facial expressions, mannerisms, wardrobe, posture - even a most unflattering hairstyle - everything about him is intense and perfectly proportioned to the image of a driven, relentless individual whose dedication to his professional responsibilities approach a level of obsession. In addition, he projects his conflicted reactions to Jackman with a degree of subtlety that serves to underscore the brilliance of the performance. A hero, but a completely original version.

On the other hand, Jackman is a bipolar wonder, succeeding in making us understand the desperation of a father willing to go to any lengths to save his child, while forcing us to cringe away from the savage capacity that might exist within us all.

Spoilers ahead, for those who haven't seen it yet.

Finally, Melissa Leo is gripping - not to mention scary as hell - as the benign, soft-spoken paragon of virtue concealing the black soul of a demon living in the heart of darkness.

One of the best of this or any other year.",1387497600,2,1656,5.0

I would've given this flick a solid 4 star rating, but the 2-5 minutes they 'saved' on the ending cost half a star IMHO. The acting was very good, and the story (although unnoticably long) was interesting and kept moving.

They did an excellent job of handling a distasteful subject without being over the top or excessively graphic. I really hate this kind of stuff, but it does remind us to check the sex-offender map for our neighborhood.

6071740,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Director Denis Villeneuve shocked us with his masterful `Incendies' and he does it again with this intensely suspenseful highly polished drama PRISONERS written by Aaron Guzikowski. Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.

The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers - father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches - father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) - both leading to very surprising endings.

The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities. But in the end credit must go to director Denis Villeneuve for his superb sculpting of this terrifying film. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 13",1387411200,,1947,5.138801261829653

6071748,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Don't let the big-name stars fool you: PRISONERS has the trappings of a low-budget, independent character study, the kind that rarely finds its audience via the big screen.  Yet, thanks to word-of-mouth and Hugh Jackman, PRISONERS actually became something of a hit.  Goes to show you that occasionally, Hollywood gets it right.

The film follows the Dover and Birch families, whose young daughters go missing over Thanksgiving.  The police quickly find a suspect, but don't have enough evidence to hold him.  Keller Dover, one of the grieving fathers, decides to take matters into his own hands, while determined police detective Loki follows up all possible leads.  The two stories frequently overlap, as suspects are eliminated and the case spirals ever onward.

Let's get one thing straight: PRISONERS is about half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes too long.  There's a lot of padding here; granted, it's meant to be realistic (""hey, coincidences exist""), but it comes off as fluff meant to make this journey last a little longer.  That being said, the story here is a doozy, a solid script elevated by stellar acting.  As Dover, Hugh Jackman delivers a performance that slowly builds on itself.  His character's actions are never fully justified, but Jackman still gives the role a level of intensity that is both fantastic and off-putting (in a good way).  Paul Dano, as the prime suspect, disappears into his role, as he tends to do; every performance he gives is entirely different and captivating.  Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, and especially Melissa Leo give fantastic turns.  But it is the film's other lead, Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes off as the true stand-out.  His performance is Oscar-worthy, at times over-the-top, yet on other occasions subtle and nuanced.  In a film filled with good actors doing great work, Gyllenhaal manages to stand out from the rest.

A disclaimer, though: PRISONERS is not easy to watch.  Not because it's about child abduction, though that will upset some.  More so, it's the fact that PRISONERS doesn't shy away from moral complexities.  There are some thoroughly disturbing images (thanks to master cinematographer Roger Deakins) that will upset many viewers.  This isn't a film about black and white justice; it's a film about the grey area, about what people are willing to do for a good cause.  As such, PRISONERS is that rare mainstream film that tackles thoroughly complex issues.  True, by its third act, it becomes more of a conventional thriller...but before that?  It's something truly worth watching, right up until the final shot.",1387238400,,2600,5.106635071090047

6071757,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (I hope that's how you spell his name) is one of the best crime drama films in a long time. It's tense, extremely well acted, and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat until the very end.

The story is simple; Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard (yep, he's in this too) are neighbors whose families gather for Thanksgiving. Everything is gravy, until both of their young daughters are kidnapped. The story then follows Jackman as he launches a relentless crusade to find his daughter. But, Jake G plays the noble but conflicted detective who is on the case to find the two girls. The detective is trying his best to find them in the most 'by the books' way he can but Hell hath no fury like that of a father whose daughter has been taken away from him. Thus, the film asks its viewers ""What would you do and how far would you go to find justice?""

The beauty of this film as opposed to other crime films is that it has a very simple plot. Most crime/mystery stories get so caught up in their complexity and convolution that you lose track of the real story at hand. Prisoners keeps it simple and relies on the complexity o its characters to carry the film. Wolverine...er..Jackman, in particular gives a terrifyingly real performance of a father who will stop at nothing to find his daughter. This is by far his best performance in a long time.

There is nothing like getting immersed into a good crime mystery and this is the best one I have seen in a while.  Incredible acting, dark tone, straightforward plot, satisfying resolution, it doesn't get much better than Prisoners.",1386979200,,1638,4.561224489795919
6071758,1,B00GBZVOEY,I just wasted 15 dollars and what seemed like a week of time waiting for a wonderful movie to appear onscreen. It never happened. I read glowing reviews and watched a couple interviews with Jake and Hugh. They are both talented enough to make this sound thrilling and realistic. To me it was a long drawn out depressing film that should have been edited to help make the story watchable. I guessed the connections rather soon in the story and by the time it was revealed I was yawning and laughing at the same time. And what the heck was wrong with Jake's eyes? He constantly looked as if he had a really bad migraine...I kept thinking that he wondered how he got buried in this mess.

There is not a single redeemable character in this movie. They are all unbelievably evil except for the two child victims, who are, almost assuredly so damaged and damned that they will grow up to become just as despicable as the adult characters in this movie. This was the most depressing film I have ever seen, and I am going to try to remove it from my film library because it was just so impossibly dark, and I am ashamed that I spent the money for it without investigating it first.

I'm not easily impressed when it comes to mysteries; I tend to figure them out rather quickly. I thought I had this one pegged, or at least mostly figured out and I was only partly right.

6071767,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is a compelling drama/thriller about two families that are forced to deal with the loss of their young daughters. When the girls go missing over the course of a seemingly normal afternoon, multiple lives are thrown into chaos in the ensuing struggle not just to find the children but also to deal with the cold reality of a world where things like this usually only happen to other people.

The plot of the movie is deceptively straightforward, but the performances and the underlying message of the film are so thickly layered that the film is a deeply engaging experience, in spite of the harsh, disturbing story it tells. This is probably the best acting I've ever seen from either Jackman or Gyllenhaal, not to mention the rest of the cast, including the remarkably talented Paul Dano as the movie's primary suspect in the kidnapping.

For a movie that has so much going on under the surface, there's very little that can be said about it without marring the amazing depth and complexity that it sets up in so many of the characters. Suffice it to say that, by the film's final moment, the title seems to have half a dozen different interpretations, the movie less about what it takes to get justice or right wrongs than it is about the many ways people can find themselves trapped by their own hearts, minds, or actions. Although the movie doesn't have a lot of action in the traditional sense, there is a whole world of turmoil and energy boiling beneath the paper-thin layers of nearly every character, even when they're just sitting and staring into space.

The best example of a movie that takes silence and stasis and turns into something that is nearly impossible to ignore, PRISONERS is one of the best dramas I've seen in a long time, and not the least because it makes absence and doubt into something so riveting and tumultuous.",1386720000,,1853,4.695384615384615

Loved the story. I don't sit through too many 2 1/2 hour movies without doing a jig, joggle and shimmy-dig-shaker quake. But this was one of the few. Oh and Hugh Jackman was tenacious.

Finally after about an almost three hour running time it just ends. Really?!?!?!!?! I sat through all of that and THAT'S the ending I got?!?!?! You could see the final twist coming a mile away if you payed close enough attention. I spent majority of the second half checking my watch numerous times.

6071772,5,B00GBZVOEY,"I had high hopes for this movie. Why? Because Jake Gyllenhaal has one sick tattoo stuck to the side of his neck. And homemade hillbilly knuckle tats. I have hillbilly blood in my genes, so this character could have been a member of my family. Or even myself.

Detective Loki is no ordinary cop. This dude is a super sleuth. With slicked back trailer trash hair and an oxford shirt that's buttoned up all the way to the top, Loki looks more like a sleazy born-again Bible salesman than effective 5-0. Hugh Jackman is ultra-realistic as the dad who is beside himself when his daughter goes missing. Keller Dover uses father's intuition to track down the S.O.B. he thinks is responsible for his kid's disappearance. Then he lays the smack down on his dirty ass.

Paul Dano plays the prime suspect, Alex Jones. Dim-witted, soft-spoken, with dorky glasses, this guy is definitely chester material. Jones is the type of individual who would orbit your child's playground during recess in a windowless cargo van with the words ""free candy"" spray-painted on the side. Instead, this character stereotype gets a convenient upgrade and drives a beat-up RV. Jones and his prehistoric wheels are the only witness to the freak disappearance of 2 young girls. Times a-ticking away when Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and relapses into a booze-fueled game of cat-and-mouse.

You would think this movie's subject matter would be depressing, but it features enough scenery-chewing and action to keep this flick from making your heart sink. The characters are both bizarre and very memorable. The ending was neither overly optimistic nor sappy tearjerker. The 2 hour and 30 minute run time is a perfect length, and moves along at an optimized pace. Give this a shot.

6071773,5,B00GBZVOEY,"A very strong psychological thriller about a kidnapping incident. Two little girls in rural Pennsylvania disappear while their families enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner. The story focuses on the case detective, who works in incredibly understaffed and under- equipped conditions, and on the parents.
While the  police makes little progress for several days, one of the fathers takes things in his own hands by kidnapping the first suspect, who had been released from custody for lack of proof.
Hard to tell more without spoilers, so this is all I am telling of the story.
It is one of the best films in this genre that I have watched in some time. I would see its only flaw in the somewhat contrived solution to the mystery. 4.5 stars.
The pressure on the parents and the detective produce  strong suspense, carried by a great cast. One or the other Oscar nomination would be in order. I am thinking mainly of Jackman, who does very well as one of the fathers.",1385078400,61,955,4.712574850299402
6071774,4,B00GBZVOEY,"I'd like to warn you this movie will make you feel depressed, and very unsettled even after it ends. So, if you're looking for a lighthearted film that makes you feel happily satisfied, you should stay away.

It suspensefully and skillfully depicts that people are not what they seem to be. Just like in reality, people cannot detect killers by judging their appearances. People were shocked when they found out the killers were the people they thought they knew well.

What makes it unsettling is the tunnel vision of one of the characters that brings tragic consequences.  This strikes a chord with me because I've seen it repeated many times in real life as shown on Dateline NBC shows. Hugh Jackman's acting convincingly increases the unsettling of the picture. His grief and actions, most of the time, reflects those of a father whose child was kidnapped.

The atmosphere is heavy and very depressing. Usually, the outdoor scenes are in gray or dark colors. They amplify the depression.
It contains many twists that make it more suspenseful. For example, the ending is different than most of the others of the same genre.

According to box office mojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:
Production Budget: $46 million
  Domestic:  $60,604,828
+ Foreign:  $52,400,000
= Worldwide:  $113,004,828

So, it took in 67 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a huge amount.

In short, it's certainly worth watching.",1384905600,5,1451,5.0
6071775,5,B00GBZVOEY,"""Prisoners"" is a bleak, gripping mystery thriller that stays with you. It's a long and involving tale of two rural Pennsylvania families devastated by the theft of their young daughters on Thanksgiving Day and of a man so driven by the loss that he is willing to do almost anything to rescue them, consequences be damned. Comparisons to the films ""Mystic River,"" ""Gone Baby Gone,"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" are inevitable, but don't let the fact that it's a genre picture deter you. The twists and turns of this confidently plotted drama will have you riveted to your seat, and the final scenes will give you more than one shock.

The film's running time of two-and-a-half hours is fully justified; there isn't a wasted moment on screen. I won't give away any details (if you want a plot synopsis, there's always Wikipedia), but be prepared to be put through an emotional wringer. The film, set in the late fall, is suffused with a wintery aura of dread and menace. The deliberate pace never lets us forget the seemingly endless wait that families of kidnapping victims must endure. Every clue that is dropped pitches us from hope into despair and back again. And a warning is in order: there are brutal scenes of torture that are deeply disturbing.

""Prisoners"" is filled with searing performances by an A-list of Hollywood's finest actors, led by Hugh Jackman as a desperate father who becomes a frightening mirror image of the monsters he pursues and Jake Gyllenhaal as a dogged detective who confronts a labyrinthine web of horror and depravity. The other anguished parents are heartbreakingly played by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, and Viola Davis, while Oscar-winner Melissa Leo appears as the mother of a disabled man, portrayed by Paul Dano, who is a prime suspect in the girls' disappearance. All of these actors, together with the film, director Denis Villeneuve, and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski, will earn consideration for Academy Awards in 2014.",1384646400,8,1962,4.96048632218845

It is hard to do a review on a movie this good, mainly because you want to describe what makes the movie so good and why you (the reviewer) feel that way. Prisoners is a good, maybe even great movie. It is a 2 hour + movie, but I guarantee you will not get bored watching this film. Every emotion, whether it be anxiety, loneliness, hope, and even sadness, you feel it with each character in the movie. That is mainly due to the acting, but also to the intensity of the story. Time does not feel like a factor watching the movie. Because in the end, everyone wants the same outcome.

As a whole, Prisoners scores high due to the Intense acting by both main/supporting actors. It succeeds even better with the emotional, drama-ridden storytelling that it brings to the table. Oscar buzz has been around Hugh Jackman's name as of late, and I gotta say rightfully so. The fearlessness and determination is unlike anything I've seen not just this year in in a movie, but in quite a while. I will definitely buy Prisoners on dvd. Prisoners gets a score of

Prisoners is a Silence of the Lambs caliber dark, terrifying and tension filled detective drama that breaks all the rules. This movie is not based on a true story, however It is a genuine look into the lives of everyone affected by a kidnapping. The story is appropriately and depressingly set in dreary rural Pennsylvania, where it always seems to be overcast and cold or rainy.

Almost all of the performances in this movie should be praised.

6071780,5,B00GBZVOEY,"PRISONERS, (2013). This crime drama/thriller, set in contemporary smalltown Pennsylvania, USA, examines the responses of  parents of kidnapped children to their desperate situation.  As written by Denis Villeneuve and directed by Aaron Guzikowski, this is one star-spangled suspenser.

To summarize the plot, let me quote from Warner Bros. Pictures, the releasing studio, as printed at IMDb:

How far would you go to protect your family? Keller Dover is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?

Hugh Jackman, (WOLVERINE), as Keller Dover, turns in a towering performance that carries the picture.  Jake Gyllenhaal, (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN), as Detective Loki, holds his own and then some, no easy thing.  Admired actor Terrence Howard (CRASH) plays Franklin Birch, father of Joy, the other missing girl.  Oscar-winning Viola Davis, (THE HELP), plays Nancy Birch, mother of Joy;  the Pennsylvania-born Maria Bello (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE)  plays Grace Dover, mother of Anna.  Paul Dano plays Alex Jones, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, (THE FIGHTER), plays Holly Jones, the aunt with whom he lives.  Dylan Minnette, who pops up everywhere playing teenage sons, plays Ralph, the Dovers' son.  Broadway favorite Len Cariou plays Father Patrick Dunn, an important supporting role.

The film is long, at 153 minutes, and I sometimes thought it could be cut by at least 30-45 minutes, particularly in some distasteful scenes apparently designed to illustrate techniques of `enhanced interrogation.'  It also seems some of us are meant to hate Keller Dover from the opening, in which he encourages his son to shoot a deer.  It is the first day of the state approved hunting season, Thanksgiving, no less.  Dover seems an illustration of the perceived-in-some-quarters gun-toting survivalist politics of the rural, poor mountainous Appalachian spine of the state, sandwiched between the richer and more liberal Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. I hated Dover throughout the picture, only to realize when I thought it over later that he was on to something all along.  Which is quite a feat of script-writing.  The presence of Melissa Leo in a supporting part is another illustration of the DePue dictum of casting: the presence of an actor more important/expensive than the part seems to require is a tipoff that the part's going to be more important than you think.  The squeamish might want to close their eyes sometimes, but thriller lovers will not want to miss this one.",1382745600,5,3021,5.202479338842975
6071781,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Prisoners is an outstanding new mystery/thriller that manages to sustain its tension right to the last second. If you have seen the trailer, you know quite a bit about Prisoners. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a construction worker who lives in a quiet New England suburb with his wife (Maria Bello), teenage son, and six year old daughter. While spending Thanksgiving with the family of his life-long friend and neighbor, Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard), Keller and Franklin discover that both of their daughters are suddenly missing. After frantically searching the area, the only lead they have is a strange RV that was parked in the area. With the help of Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the police, they are able to track down the RV and apprehend a suspect (Paul Dano), but due to his mental incapacity and lack of evidence, he is released. This sends Prisoners in a harrowing new direction as Keller and Franklin wade through some ethically murky waters in the search for their daughters.

Prisoners does a phenomenal job of keeping its cards close to the vest. In its transition from drama to revenge thriller, director Denis Villenuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski do not force the film in any one direction continuously playing with the audience's sensibilities. Villenuve and Guzikowski are relative newcomers to the scene, although Villenuve did helm the 2010 Best Foreign Film Oscar nominee, Incendies. This is also a very smart movie in that it is not a run of the mill type of thriller. Several nuanced touches and motifs present themselves that allow the film to be absorbed to a deeper level, resulting in a film that stays with you long after you leave the theater. Take special note of the film's opening scene and revisit it after having seen the movie for a taste of what I'm talking about.

Holy smokes! Look at all of those awards...sorry Paul Dano.

The film manages the gripping tone of films like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac. The film also looks great. It was shot by Roger Deakins, known for his work with the Coen Brothers on most of their projects. With Prisoners, Deakins uses his static and deliberate camera movements to enhance every suspenseful opportunity. It's a tremendously well-crafted picture and a finely acted one as well. The film boasts Academy Award winners and nominees aplenty, and all of them are looking for more in this film. Gyllanhaal is especially good at elevating the traditional detective character to something more relatable, raw, and grounded. This is, however, Jackman's movie in every way. He takes the audience on a wild ride of emotion bringing just the right amount of crazy to keep us from judging his choices too harshly.

Prisoners is not just a good start to the fall movie season, it sets the bar. Few films offer such chilling emotion, engrossing action, and captivating performances, especially with running times of 158 minutes! This is truly an excellent film. A

Prisoners is rated R an has a running time of 2 hours and 38 minutes. Use the restroom before you start it because you won't want to miss a second of it.",1382572800,,3105,4.862003780718337

6071783,4,B00GBZVOEY,"***This review may contain spoilers***

The movie ""Prisoners"" simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript, blue-collar town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner.  Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision.  They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside.  Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped.  Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why.  There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?

Perhaps it's not so simple.  ""Prisoners"" spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends.  But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it.  Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia.  However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive.  He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath.  He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence.  Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...

As the mystery progresses, ""Prisoners"" takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions.  As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior.  If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action.  But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic?  As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate,  ""Prisoners"" reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance.  In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast.  Even though he gets violently frustrated by the case, Loki's professionalism and logic keep him on course and help him progress in his investigation.  Keller does not do the same for most of the movie until it's too late.  Like Loki, he learns the truth of the abduction, but his emotional prison may end up leading to a literal one as well.",1381968000,,3252,5.115530303030303
6071784,4,B00GBZVOEY,"The stuff that separates a good film from a great film can be so elusive. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a kidnap based plot and it's one of my favorites. But seeing ""Prisoners"" put the entire genre in a whole new realm.

Here's the scoop. Set in rural Pennsylvania, two families are celebrating Thanksgiving when their two youngest daughters go missing. The police are called and the investigation begins. But the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) has his own ideas of what happened and pursues his own line of investigation. Both his work and that of the detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) take some surprising turns.

It's difficult to express how incredibly good this film is. Famed d.p. Roger Deakins lensed it and keeps the sheen off. This does not have the gloss of a Hollywood production. This is middle class America and you feel as though you are there with these people. The mud, rain, snow and budget furniture are things most of us have experienced. And the relationship between Gyllenhaal and his Captain is peculiar to say the least. Let's look at Gyllenhaal's Loki. First, he's named after the Norse God. He's great at what he does, But this is no slick, college educated guy. He looks as though he came up from the street. He's got a big tattoo on his neck. Others on his hands and knuckles (I'd love to know what those symbols represent). His clothes don't fit well and he seems to have no family or close friends. What an interesting character. And Hugh Jackman. I'm not a big fan of his because I just don't think he's that good, but he does a real stand-up job here. Far better than I've ever seen him. Same with Terrence Howard. This, for my dollar, is his best work. But Maria Bello, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo all turn in great performances.

What really shines here is the script. You think you have things nailed down but it keeps twisting up to the end. And these aren't cheap plot turns. Though at first you might be scratching your head, all the loose ends come together in a very realistic fashion. The hand of God does come down in one crucial scene and part of the climax is a bit Hollywood but the rest is so outstanding it's easy to forgive it its weaknesses. And the ending. What a total creepfest.

While there, Franklin Grover (Terrence Howard) decides to entertain with his trumpet and the next thing you know their young daughters are missing. The son recalls a van nearby that the girls wanted to play on. The police (Jake Gyllenhaal) quickly get the van and the driver (Paul Dano), but it is clean and the driver ""has the mind of a ten year old."" To the dismay of Keller, the police let him go with the expected vigilante results by Keller.

As it turns out the tale is slightly more twisted than on the surface.

I will say the acting is good, but we have seen so many films of this genre they clearly ran out of catchy names and simply called this one ""Prisoners"" allowing the viewer to make everyone a prisoner either physically or of the mind. Yawn. I really liked the ""Dirty Harry"" version of this genre. Go ahead. Compare the dialog. Make my day. It took both Jackman and Gyllenhaal together to do what Eastwood did better by himself.

I am not saying this is a bad film, by no means. It is certainly worthy of a rental, especially if you like to see parents lament over their missing child. I just can't see shelling out a lot of green for a film that will remembered as a trivia question.

6071786,4,B00GBZVOEY,"A crime has been committed and the culprit is Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners. The French Canadian director leads an all star cast in this crime thriller; which gained the attention of many moviegoers.. Already Prisoners is getting praise from critics everywhere; but does the crime thriller live up to the early reviews?

The story of Prisoners centers around a case of two missing girls. When Anna and Joy disappear on Thanksgiving, their families do everything in their power to look for them. It comes to the point where Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, abducts and torture suspect Alex Jones. With Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, on the case, everyone involved will discover there is more going on then just a mere kidnapping.

Prisoners features a compelling plot that's not hard to follow. You will be guessing all the way through the 2 hour and 33 minute run time.  As a crime story goes, Prisoners is straight forward; but that does work for the movie. Nothing in the story feels it takes you out of the film; nor is there a twist there for the sake of being a twist. Everything in the plot fits, giving Prisoners a story fitting of the genre.

While Prisoners has a massive ensemble, the show-stealers are the leads: Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllehaal. While I can't say Hugh Jackman had a ground breaking performance, he still brought his charisma to Keller; creating one dynamic role for the actor. The same applies for Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki; though this is definitely one the actor's best roles in sometime. While the rest of the cast did not have monumental performances, they still fit and gave Prisoners a ensemble to be proud of.

What got my attention was the world of the movie. Denis Villenueve's direction in  the cinematography was perfect, giving Prisoners a realistic tone. That and the direction in some of scenes was awe-inspiring. The sequence of Detective Loki driving through traffic was tense and quite possible one of the best shot car scenes I've seen in a while.

Prisoners is everything a fan of crime films can hope for. The movie is tense and it keeps you guessing all the way through. Even if you are not shock by the twists in the film, you will be impressed by the movie's execution. Yes , Prisoners did commit a crime, and that crime was capturing this critic's approval.

While this is one of the best movies of the year and I honestly think Oscar nominations are not a long shot this movie leaves you feeling tense and uneasy the entire time. The fact that there is very little music helps create the tension it is going for. While this is a great movie and a must see this isn't one you can watch over and over due to the emotion and the way it makes you feel, especially if you are a parent.

Needless to say, it did!

This film is one where it really does help where you go in knowing nothing, and haven't watched any clips of it, except maybe the trailer. This is what I did. The movie may start out slow, but even the LITTLEST things that you may not think of as being significant, turn out to be. It is one long, gigantic mystery, and you never know what to expect! (Though near the end, I was able to accurately put together lots of clues/work them out.)

The film is very disturbing in some parts, too, but it is still excellent. The pacing is very good, the movie is very dark and creepy lighting wise, and the acting is good too. My favorite character was definitely Detective Loki--super handsome, smart, AND sweet in his own way. :)

Though the very ending wasn't my favorite, and there is one very questionable statement made by one of the little girls in one part that confused the heck out of me (and is never resolved/explained), this is still by far the best movie I've seen in theaters for awhile since Harry Potter ended, and one of my new faves! I will definitely be buying the blu-ray when it is available, and I urge anyone and everyone to see it!

But once you are aware a kidnapping has occurred, you are ALL IN until the harrowingly redemptive conclusion.

There is a strong thread of Judeo-Christian understanding informing this film, and it is pretty tough stuff. Not an ounce of easy reassurance in the script, performances, the ominous score or top-notch cinematography. You'll hear a telling section from the book of Job on a car radio. I thought the theological hints from earlier in the film should've been present in the closing scenes, too - it wasn't - but attentive and perceptive viewers will realize that, in addition to the masterful suspense, you have met some serious evil in this film. And this evil scars and deforms everyone, including the protagonists. Redemption in this life costs a lot, and the success of PRISONERS is that you understand this by the time the credits roll.

6071791,5,B00GBZVOEY,"""Prisoners"" brings us some relatively new faces on the creative Hollywood scene and what they bring us is completely promising if not great. Veteran Coen Brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins lends his expertise to newcomer writer Aaron Guzikowski and Director Denis Villeneuve.  You can certainly see the influence of Deakins throughout the film and his beautiful take on reality in a chaotic situation.

This is one of those films that you don't want to know a thing about before you go. You don't even want to hear people brushstroke over it because even that is something you don't want to hear. For that matter, I won't even go close to going there. I will give you a brief introduction to what you should expect. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello), walk down the street to their neighbors, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis). They each have a daughter and along the course of the evening, those two daughters disappear without a trace.

""Prisoners"" is a gut-wrenching and fast running two and a-half hour movie. It is filmed in such a way that the events that unfold could involve you, your neighbor, somebody across town and on your local news.  Along with the way the movie is filmed and told, it is gifted with phenomenal actors that bring the reality of the situation to the surface.

It is an exhausting an emotionally filled movie from top to bottom and its subject matter will have your stomach in knots until the credits roll.  This, quite simply, is what movies are all about. Too often these days, movies make you feel nothing. Too many directors and writers are concerned with what you see and forget that first and foremost, what makes great cinema and long lasting cinema, is the feeling it leaves in your stomach and soul. At one point, Keller Dover's sadness effected me so much that I felt as if I was actually him or in the least, one of his family members or a great friend.

""Prisoners"" is the kind of movie we should be flocking to the theaters to see until Hollywood gets the message that we want to feel something.  Sure, dazzle us with visuals, but until you relay empathy in your audience members, you have wasted millions of dollars and time.  ""Prisoners"" is tremendous filmmaking. It is one of the best and most complete films of the year and will almost certainly be a member of the Oscar night nominees.",1379980800,3,2386,4.688995215311005
6071792,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Directed by Dennis Villeneuve, this crime thriller received a poor review in the local paper, but a strong recommendation from a friend prompted me to see it.  The movie played at the Toronto Film Festival before its release. It was the top box office draw the first weekend after its release on September 20.

At over 2.5 hours, ""Prisoners"" is long and begins slowly. The tension builds throughout, however, as the tangled plot develops. The film held my attention. In noting the commercial success of the movie, the ""Los Angeles Times"" aptly described it as a ""head spinning hybrid combining elements that are rarely combined."" These elements include noir and murder together with meditations on violence, vigilantism, religion, and parenting.

The two lead characters, Keller Dover and Detective Laki are played respectively by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall.  Dover is a home repair contractor and a fundamentalist Christian. Laki is a tight-lipped, hardbitten, and successful tattooed detective. Gyllenhall's portrayal is a highlight of the movie.

Dover and his wife visit their friends and neighbors, the Birches, for Thanksgiving, and the two daughters of the couples are mysteriously abducted. The movie involves a search for the perpetrator with Laki the lead detective assigned to the case. Attention focuses on a young man, Alex Jones, (Paul Dano) who it turns out has the I.Q. of a boy of ten. When the police release Jones, Dover takes the law into his own hands and kidnaps and brutally beats him as the suspected abductor. The Birches back off from the cruelty but don't report Dover to the police. The convoluted plot develops through many twists as Laki works with determination to save the girls and find the kidnapper.

There are several ""prisoners"" to give the movie its title, including the two abducted girls and Alex. Possibly the chief ""prisoner"" is Dover, who is an internal prisoner of his fear, anger and thirst for vengeance.

The movie includes substantial and somewhat ersatz religious symbolism. Besides Dover's fundamentalism, (the hymn ""What a Friend we have in Jesus"" plays ironically throughout) the movie features a priest who is a sexual predator as well as characters who lose their religious faith when their young son dies of cancer. The primary focus, however, is on vengeance and viligantism.

The strengths of the movie include Gyllenhall's acting, the noir setting, including cold and snowy rainy nights, frightening special effects, dramatic tension, and the foreboding musical score.  The weaknesses include the complex, coincidence-driven plot, and an over-straining for symbols and meaning.

Given its hybrid character, and the mixed recommendations I received before seeing the film, viewers are likely to have differing responses to ""Prisoners"". I would not give it raves, but I found ""Prisoners"" well done and worth seeing.

6071793,4,B00GBZVOEY,"Theatrical Review.  There may be spoilers.

Director Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") asks the question, ""What would you do if your child disappears?""  Hugh Jackman takes his Wolverine and Jean Valjean character's anger to a new level in this horrifying film.  He plays Keller Dover, a middle class Pennsylvanian who does work renovating houses.  His wife, Grace (Maria Bello) is a perfect companion.  Together they have 2 children.  Six year old Anna and teenage Ralph (Dylan Minnette).  They are having dinner at their neighbor and best friend's house.  Viola Davis and Terrence Howard are Nancy and Franklin Birch who have similar aged kids.  Young Eliza and teen daughter, Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).

After dinner, the two younger kids want to go back to the Dover house to retrieve a doll or something.  Nobody's paying much attention until everyone realizes they never came back.  The search is on and after checking the neighborhood, the police are called.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who heads up the search.  The police quickly track down a suspect who had been mysteriously parked in front of a vacant house in the neighborhood.  Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is the prime suspect, but he isn't talking.  Primarily because he has the mind of a 10 year old.  In addition, his RV that the girls had been playing on earlier, produced no evidence that the girls were ever there.

The two families, Keller in particular, are convinced that Jones knows where the girls are and are frustrated that he is released by the police.  As days past, Loki follows other clues while still focusing on Jones.  This doesn't satisfy Keller who eventually takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Jones, holding him captive in an old apartment building he owns.  Villeneuve doesn't hold back as Keller beats Jones to a bloody pulp, later moving him to a small closet for some old fashion water torture.  While all this is going on, Loki finds another suspect unbeknownst to Keller.  So is Jones innocent after all?

Melissa Leo plays Holly Jones, Alex's adoptive aunt.  She's critical to the investigation, providing background to Alex's upbringing.  Her own background is a bit of a mystery, but both Loki and Keller continue to probe.  This movie is difficult to watch, not only because of the subject matter and torture scenes, but because it makes the viewer realize that there is an inner animal in all of us.  The writing is excellent, the cinematography is superb.  Strong performances by all but especially Jackman as Keller and Davis in her supporting role.  Dark and foreboding but a strong piece of filmmaking that will keep you talking well after the final credits roll.",1379894400,7,2675,4.930493273542601

6071795,3,B00GBZVOEY,"PRISONERS, Denis Villeneuveis's gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two young girls in suburban Pennsylvania, is definitely compelling.  But it's also totally over-the-top and laden with ridiculous coincidences that defy credibility.  The screenplay, by Aaron Guzikowski (CONTRABAND), gives us a number of interesting characters, including harried police detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is called in to investigate the disappearance of two girls on Thanksgiving Day.  The father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), goes from being cooperative with the police to full-on vigilante after the prime suspect -- Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a disturbed young man whose RV was seen parked in the Dovers' neighborhood - is released for lack of evidence.  Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello) spends most of the movie in a semi-catatonic state, waiting for word of her missing child.  And the other girl's parents, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrance Howard and Viola Davis), are little more than background characters.  So what we get is two-and-a-half hours of unrelenting tension as Loki tries to unravel the case and Dover goes abu ghraib on hapless Jones.  How far is it permissible to go to save a child?  And are we all prisoners, trapped by circumstances beyond our control into behaving in ways that destroy us?

The biggest problem with the film, aside from its over-the-top sensationalism, is the number of coincidences that confound credibility.  [SPOILERS AHEAD -- proceed with caution!] Loki questions a priest who's on the sex offender list, and he finds a decomposed body in the basement.  Then there's a guy in a hoodie seen lurking around a candlelight vigil for the missing girls, and then later sneaking into their houses - turns out he's obsessed with mazes and has a thing for snakes and kids' clothes.  Loki also interviews the mother of a young boy who was kidnapped decades earlier under similar circumstances, a cute little boy seen riding his bike in videos.  Prime suspect Jones, who's described as having the IQ of a ten-year-old, lives with his aunt, whose husband disappeared five years before and hasn't been seen since.  All of these seemingly random events are ultimately connected like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, fitting together to create an insidious picture of a world gone mad.  It's beyond soap opera, beyond anything that could pass for possible, and it undermines whatever impact the film ultimately delivers - or doesn't.

There are definitely hints in PRISONERS of other films with similar themes, like THE VANISHING (1993), A SIMPLE PLAN (1998), IN THE BEDROOM (2001), and MYSTIC RIVER (2003).  In all of them, there are kidnappings, misunderstandings, vigilante actions, and twisted endings.  Innocent people die in these films, and ostensibly good people do very bad things.  The point of MYSTIC RIVER seems to be that when we play vigilante, even with the best of motives, we become the monsters we seek to destroy.  PRISONERS never goes quite that far, as if Guzikowski and Villeneuveis aren't quite willing to take a stand on the horror they splash across the screen.  Is Jackman's Keller Dover a monster of his own making, or just a father doing everything he can to find his missing daughter?  In other words, is he channeling Liam Neeson from TAKEN (2008), or Sean Penn from MYSTIC RIVER?  Because it makes a difference, and those are two very different film.

I wish I had liked PRISONERS more, since it's one of the few films released this year that isn't about superheroes, comic books, or boob jokes.  For that reason alone, I hope it does well enough to encourage studios to continue producing adult films with intelligent scripts.  But I also wish the script were a bit more intelligent and a bit less sensational.  This isn't a bad film so much as a disappointing one.  With a cast like that it should have been amazing.  It isn't.  And that's a shame.  Watch it for the performances, for the bleak and unrelenting setting, and for the level of tension that never relents.  But be prepared for loose ends, over-the-top behavior (especially from Jackman's character), and enough coincidences to make the whole thing seem ultimately ridiculous.  It's worth talking about, though, and that's a good thing.  Not many movies are these days.",1379808000,13,4301,5.036775106082037
6071796,2,B00GBZVOEY,"""Prisoners"" 2013 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script

I wanted to see ""Prisoners"" after I saw the trailer. Alas, the trailer contains all the best parts of the movie. Suburban parents celebrating Thanksgiving slowly come to realize that their two daughters are missing. The trailer featured quiet, dark scenes of increasing menace and despair, shot in realistic, autumnal, suburban settings. The trailer promised big, big stars: Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as one set of parents and Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other, Jake Gyllenhaal as the police detective, Paul Dano as the suspect and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive parent. The trailer promised an intelligent thriller that would interrogate how far an ethical person could go in attempting to rescue his daughter from an abductor. The trailer also seemed to suggest an examination of how law enforcement responds, for better or worse, in child abduction cases.

The first twenty minutes of ""Prisoners"" delivered what I'd hoped for based on the trailer, but I was hyper-aware that I was watching scene after scene I'd already seen in the trailer.

Around the time that an unlikely body was found in an unlikely spot, and a fist met a face several times more than was necessary to make any point, but certainly enough times to satisfy a filmgoer's sick, sadistic bloodlust, the movie went off the rails for me, abandoned all its seriousness and intelligence, and became sensational gore and commercial pap. I was so let down I wanted to leave the theater, but I stayed because I'd roped two friends into seeing this with me.

""Prisoners"" is a whodunit so there's a limit to what I can say without revealing any spoilers. I can say this. Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully performs a dedicated police detective. Hugh Jackman exercises his neck veins a lot, and his American accent is wobbly but okay. Terence Howard, Viola Davis, and Maria Bello are given criminally little to do. Viola Davis has one of the most interesting scenes in the movie. This scene is only a minute or two long and it is not developed at all. That is a shame because the scene is the moral crux of the film. And the film does nothing with it; the filmmakers went with implausible sensationalism and sadism rather than substance. Paul Dano, as the suspect, and Melissa Leo, as his adoptive mother, both give powerhouse performances in very challenging roles.

Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless. He avoids explosive stunts and theatrics with his camera. His moves are slow and quiet, even while filming ugly violence. I'd like to see his work on a better script.

There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass. ""Through a glass darkly"" is a line from the Bible. Ooo big symbolism. Wow. There are many crosses, including one hanging from the rearview mirror in Keller - Hugh Jackman's - truck. Wow. Heavy. I just may think something ... no, I'd rather watch snakes. Oh, yes. There are snakes. Some understand Satan as taking snake form in Genesis. Heavy. Profound! Yeah, not really. Just bizarrely implausible. There are strange character names. Hugh Jackman's first name is ""Keller"" which brings to mind the blind and deaf Helen Keller, or maybe the word ""Killer."" Jake Gyllenhaal is Detective Loki. Loki is the trickster God of Norse mythology. This is all pretty high school.

There are two scenes and one character treatment in this film that I found completely implausible. The two scenes are essential to the plot. I can't describe these two scenes but I can say that one is utterly implausible because of surveillance. The action of the film takes place within hours and days of a child abduction. Not only police, but also media and neighbors would be keeping an eagle eye on all suspects. Another scene is implausible because it demands that we forget everything we've been told about a key character. One character treatment is unbelievable to me because a very unlikely character is depicted as being as heroic, in his way, as John McCain. Not plausible. I also found the final resolution of the crime to be something that would only occur in a writer's imagination, and the ending to be pointlessly cute.

Again, the opening scenes of the dawning awareness that a child has been abducted are powerful, but the film totally lost me with its comic book sensationalism, sadism, and - I have to say it - stupidity.",1379808000,6,4455,4.891390728476821

6071798,5,B00GBZVOEY,"Hugh Jackman continues to be a huge draw and a well-respected A-list actor in Hollywood.  Even though he earned his popularity as the comic book character, Wolverine, in the X-Men films, it would appear his comic book drawing power isn't what it used to be.  Jackman's most recent film, The Wolverine, was a bit of a disappointment and prompted questions about whether or not his tenure of playing the character might be coming to an end in the not so distant future.  While this might disappoint comic book fans, it might not be the worst news since Jackman continues to thrive in dramatic roles.  Within the last year alone, Jackman has been nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in Les Mis&eacute;rables.  Now, Hugh Jackman is back in a dramatic role once again for the mystery thriller, Prisoners.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies), Prisoners stars Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, a parent that is severely distraught after the sudden disappearance of his young daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and her friend, Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).  The local police quickly become involved as Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a detective that has yet to leave a case unresolved, quickly targets Alex Jones (Paul Dano), as the potential kidnapper, despite a lack of evidence.  Regardless of the fact that Jones is a mentally challenged man and appears to be innocent, Keller decides to kidnap him and torture him anyway, believing he's the one holding the girls.  As the days pass and time continues to run out, Loki focuses on a variety of different possible suspects, all the while Dover and Joy's father, Franklin (Terrence Howard), continue their abusive attempts to make Jones reveal the whereabouts of the girls.  Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and David Dastmalchian also star in supporting roles.

First and foremost - as far as the story goes, Prisoners is an enjoyable thrill-ride from start to finish.  At no point does this story ever feel slow or lack entertainment value.  There is enough happening within this story that it will keep you guessing about which one of the characters is guilty, all the while wondering to what the extent the main characters will go to find out where their daughters are being held.  However, there is a bit too much story than there really needs to be - often spending too much time introducing new characters with no other purpose than to throw viewers off about whom the real guilty party turns out to be.  Naturally, the introduction of these characters causes the plot to balloon out to the point that the film might have some moviegoers checking their watch.  But, if the biggest complaint is about the movie being 15 minutes too long, that's usually a good sign for the overall quality of the flick.

Co-starring alongside Hugh Jackman is another Academy Award nominee, Jake Gyllenhaal.  Playing a relentless detective, Gyllenhaal most certainly shines in this role, although no more or less than in his most recent endeavors, such as End of Watch, Love & Other Drugs, and Zodiac.  Gyllenhaal has become a household name himself and although his scenes are not as emotionally involved as Jackman's scenes, he still gives a standout performance.  His slicked-back hair, nervous ticks, and tattoos depict him to be a hard-nosed, overzealous law enforcer that pushes the laws to the limit to retrieve vital information. In one particular scene, his character goes nose-to-nose with one of the potential kidnappers, which eventually ends with a needlessly bloody outcome - due to his character's lack of patience.  Clearly, Detective Loki (which feels like an Avengers plug) is the type of detective any parent would want on the street looking for their missing child.

While Jake Gyllenhaal is just as much of a main player as Hugh Jackman, he is easily outshined by Jackman's role of the emotionally distraught father.  It's unimaginable how it must feel to have you child kidnapped, but Jackman does a commanding job in the role as he goes through the periods of being fearful, angry, and eventually vengeful - nearly to the fullest extent.  He presses the relevant question, how far would you go as a father to find your kidnapped child?  The emotions flowing through Jackman's character makes for some extremely intense scenes, including a film scene-stealing in which Jackman's character faces off with Gyllenhaal's character outside a liquor store.  Even though Jackman's portrayal is absolutely flawless throughout the course of this mystery flick, this particular scene is a prime example of what drives people to go to movies in the first place.  This is dramatic acting at its absolutely finest.

The supporting cast of Prisoners follows the coattails of Jackman and Gyllenhaal closely.  The portrayals by Paul Dano as suspected kidnapper Alex Jones and Terrence Howard as parent Franklin Birch are both noteworthy, but are easily overshadowed and play second fiddle to A-list stars, not to mention the film's captivating storyline - written by Aaron Guzikowski.  Each interaction between the film's characters is better than the last as the film progresses, and as the scenes become tenser, it becomes abundantly clear that Guzikowski's feel for these characters is spot-on.  The writing and dialogue are obviously one of the main contributing factors in the overall success of this film.

Overall, Prisoners is gripping, mysterious, and a complete joy to witness, regardless of its traumatic nature.  Hugh Jackman gives the performance of a lifetime, and while it's difficult to say it's the best role of his career, it certainly includes one particular scene that will go down as one of his all-time most memorable moments.  Honestly, there isn't enough praise for the cast of this film, but it really is the plot that makes this such a unique and ambitious film.  And, the best part of this film is the end.  If you think you can see this film's outcome long before it happens, you'll be dead wrong.  You may guess who the ""bad guy"" turns out to be, but the last scene is completely unpredictable.  While the film might not have the most desirable ending for some, it absolutely has the proper ending.  Prisoners should quickly be added to the top of every must-see movie list and is easily one of the most recommended films of the year.  Enjoy.

8622078,5,B00GBZVOEY,Very well acted and honest depiction of how two families react to their abducted children. Watch carefully because subtle things happen in the beginning that explain why things turn out as they do.  I do not think jackman was over the top.  They all played their roles perfectly.  I def did not see this as a ploy to bring a religious statement to the plot.  The mood was dark throughout and very suspenseful!,1531526400,,409,4.561643835616438

8622084,4,B00GBZVOEY,"This is a perfect example of a film with inconsistencies, with implausible and sometimes even boneheaded actions on the part of the main characters, with irritating failures in reason and logic--but all of which we easily ignore, for the overall telling of the story is so superbly rendered.  The pacing, the atmosphere is so expertly developed, the acting so fine, that any lapses are swallowed up and overwhelmed by the excellence of the whole.

It's been a while since I've seen a film which establishes and maintains an atmosphere so strong and so in line with the subject matter.  Yes, the story is grim--and every scene of the film makes you feel it.  Yet it is not too much.  It does not wrench you into feeling its moments, but rather draws you in slowly and inexorably; it's as if we're apportioned a half-strength of the emotions felt by the characters.  This keeps us just comfortably out of harm's way, able to empathize, but enabling us to retain objectivity.  It's the perfect place I want to be, watching a story like this.",1529884800,,1038,4.701657458563536
8622085,5,B00GBZVOEY,"The package arrived earlier than expected and the film was, although not enjoyable as most Dennis V. Movies and considering it has my two favorite actors in it I expects too much but none the less it is a very enjoyable mystery movie. I thought it was great!",1529712000,,258,4.395833333333333
