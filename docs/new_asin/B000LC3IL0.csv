Kane vs. Finley
Horrible chemistry between the two of them. Kane meshes well with brawlers, and Finley works better with wrestlers who can actually, um, WRESTLE. This match was hardly Smackdown! material.

Triple Threat for the IC title
Umaga vs. Kennedy vs. Carlito
I guess this pay-per-view was during the few weeks Jeff Hardy was gone. Three heels in an Intercontinental Title Match, wow, great marketing WWE!!
I should have known that Umaga wasn't going to work well with Kennedy and Carlito. This match was missing a fan favorite, even though it sucked for different reasons.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo
So, Mysterio won, shocker!! Welcome back, Rey, I missed you. But this was the worst match that you and Chavo have put on.

WWE Diva Battle Royal
Waste of time...Why wasn't the title defended??

MVP and Matt Hardy in a beer drinking contest featuring Stone Cold Steve Austin
It was nice to see Austin, but MVP and Matt (along with Rey) are the ONLY reasons I watch Smackdown!! and they could have at least wrestled.

ECW Championship Match
John Morrison vs. CM Punk
Okay, so Morrison and Punk aren't EXTREME. So, why are they wrestling for this belt? I've seen the two of them wrestle on ECW and out of the three matches I've seen, the ones on television were A LOT better. Good wrestling matches, but they were NOT extreme. This fued is probably better suited for the IC or US title.

Triple H vs. King Booker
Booker's last match with the WWE was NOT a great one. Triple H and Booker's match at Wrestlemania a few years ago was A LOT better. Welcome back, Triple H., thanks for screwing Bret and thanks for another mediocre match.

World Heavyweight Title
Great Khali vs. Batista
These two have to be the worst ""wrestlers"" in WWE history. Anyone remember Ultimate Warrior?

Horrible, disgusting. There are not enough words to describe how pathetic this match was. David Arquette was a better World Champion than these two losers.

WWE Championship Match
John Cena vs. Randy Orton
Here's the shocker, Cena won!! Booooooooooo.
If this match was anything, it was predictable. Can Cena win with anything other than his finishing moves? Maybe a rollup once in awhile? If he knows how to do one.

Overall, The ""Biggest Party of the Summer"" was the worst pay-per-view of the year.

Thank GOD Shawn is back!!",1194048000,2,2484,4.685057471264368
2701725,3,B000LC3IL0,"After two years of SummerSlam being a huge disappointment, WWE came back with a nice edition of what is suppost to be their ""Biggest Party Of The Summer.""  This isn't like the 2002 edition where it was something you need to go out of your way to see but it's definately NOT like the SummerSlam's of the previous 2 years where it wasn't worth the time to rent & watch.

Kane vs. Finlay - A good opener with Finlay working over Kane's injured ribs and Kane overcoming the pain. Also look out for some comedic moments as well involving the Crusierweight Champion.

Intercontinental Champion Umaga vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Carlito - This was a fun triple threat with both Kennedy & Carlito always targeting Umaga whenever he was in the ring showing he was the main threat in the match by going to the extreme like hitting him with the monitor, kicking his head into the steps & trying to double team him various times in the match.  Good effort from all 3 men involved.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero - Before I get started, what was Rey thinking with that bodypaint?  He came off as someone who forgot to rub in his lotion instead of the intended ""Silver Surfer"" character.  This surpassed their match last year but not their greatest encounter (which I thought was their Bash '04 match).  Chavo working on Rey's leg that he injured a year ago & Rey heavily selling it made for good inring storytelling.

Divas Battle Royal - This wasn't a straight T&A segment and was actually a nice little battle royal as well.  Nothing noteworthy but enjoyable.

Right around here was a segment involving a beer drinking contest between MVP & Matt Hardy's substitute & the star of The Condemned...""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin that resulted in the usual...Austin stunning the guy & having a beer bash.

ECW Champion John Morrison vs. CM Punk - I'm sorry but the DVD I rented had a bad scratch on this match & kept skipping so I can't comment.

Triple H vs. King Booker - Booker got a shot here & there but for the most part, he was just a body for Triple H to dominate & defeat in his return.

World Champion Great Khali vs. Batista - This was awful & boring...in other words, your typical Khali match.  Being an ""attraction wrestler"" can't carry your behind when the bell rings if your opposition isn't a spot money, which Batista isn't.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Randy Orton - This had the crowd the hottest they've been non-stop all night during a match.  Orton & Cena meshed well here together to give you a match that I enjoyed despite what happened in the last 3 seconds & who got their hand raised.  It went back & forth with Orton bringing forth his best inring effort I've seen in months while Cena broke out of his sterotypical ""5 holds"" moveset with holds like a legdrop drop the top rope & even his old ""throwback"" hangman's neckbreaker.  Great match & effort from both men.

DVD extras include the ending to the SmackDown Khali vs. Kane match before the PPV & Triple H's return to RAW the next night during Carlito's Cabana guest startting Mr. McMahon.

In the end, this PPV under any other circumstances would be just an average PPV but concidering the very LOW quality of PPV's that WWE has been cranking out since Backlash...this looks alot better in comparison.  One review called this a ""house show""...well, if that's the case then it was an enjoyable house show.  I recommend as this was one of the best during a very bad year for WWE.",1193011200,4,3433,4.519417475728155
2701726,1,B000LC3IL0,this summerslam is by far mediocraty at its best.cause thats what this ppv was mediocre i own lots of summerslams and this is not the one i would get cause its very lame boring and slow. i would rather watch the man with the golden gun or license to kill better than this. 20th summerslam at its worst.mr mcmahon should be ashamed.,1192492800,,331,4.354838709677419
2701727,4,B000LC3IL0,"The 20th Summerslam PPV extravaganza featured three PPV quality matches among many average ones. PPV quality matches feature near falls, good in-ring chemistry, good counter wrestling, tell a good story, and have a solid finish. The three matches that had all these key elements were Cena vs. Orton, HHH vs. KING BOOKA , and Rey Mysterio vs. OOOOO CHAVO! I was somewhat disappointed by the rest of the card, especially by the Batista/Khali match. Khali is just hurting WWE's image....period. I could have easily seen the same exact match on friday night smackdown or monday night raw. The same goes for the other matches on the card like finlay vs. kane and the triple threat intercontinental title match. I'm not saying that these guys are poor wrestlers. These matches just did not meet PPV standards. IF you look at past Summerslam events, this one ranks a little farther down the list. WWE just does not have the star power it had five or six years ago. But more importantly, wwe needs to do a better job of building up some of their matches, especially for a major event like summerslam.",1191542400,,1092,4.752631578947368

Winner: Kane
Rating: *** (Really good opener and actually one of Kane's better matches in a while. He looked really impressive tonight as did Finlay who is always good in the ring. Entertaining finishing moments to this match and two really strong performances.)

Backstage Jonathon Coachman, Teddy Long, Armando Alejandro Estrada, William Regal, and Vince McMahon are partying in the office. Vince asks where are the women.

(Champion) Umaga vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Carlito

Winner: Umaga
Rating: ** 1/2 (Fine match, although I expected better. Surprisingly enough Kennedy was the one to take the pin, didn't expect that. But the action was solid but not unpredictable enough for a triple threat match.)

Winner: Rey Mysterio
Rating: *** (Great to see Mysterio back. Both he and Chavo put on a good, satisfactory match. I liked how they played off Rey's surgical knee with Chavo working on it most of the match. I can't wait to see more from Rey now that he's back.)

Backstage Todd Grisham is with King Booker and Queen Sharmell. Booker says Rey had a triumphant return but Triple H's return will be a tragedy. Booker says Triple H will have a grand entrance and big fan reaction so he should take that all in because by ends night Triple H will bow down to King Booker.

MATCH 4: Diva Battle Royal Where The Winner Will Face Women's Champion Candice Michelle In An Upcoming Date

Women's Champion Candice Michelle comes out looking amazing. She is seated in a king/queen like chair with peacock feathers in front of the announcers table. I'm sure Booker and Sharmell are furious right now! All the divas come out with Maria's entrance music in this order..

Why not just have a one on one match. Waste of time, didn't really care for the result. I think Mickie or Michelle should have won, don't care for Beth. The highlight was seeing Candice who was thankfully not in this mess of a match.)

Candice and Beth have a stardown as..

MVP's music hits and he makes his way to the ring along with an ice chest. MVP says no one bought a ticket tonight to see the Divas, but instead to see MVP.

Winner: John Morrison
Rating: ** (Nothing went together in this match. Both styles completely messed up the match. Which is a shock since Punk and Morrison have put on good bouts in the past. Morrison wins again for the third time, why can't Punk get a title win? Is he still in the doghouse with the WWE? I kinda figured Morrison would win since they had a vignette over him before the match and not any mention on Punk. Ok match, but kind of a letdown.)

Another Raw promo.

Backstage The Great Khali and Batista are shown on split screens.

Batista ducks a chair shot and nails a spear. Batista gets the chair and begins swinging away at Khali repeatedly.

Orton covers, one, two, no only two! Cena then lifts up Orton and nails the FU out of knowhere for the win!

Winner: John Cena
Rating: *** 1/4 (Good main event, although I expect a **** (four star) match for some reason. But all of those sleeperholds from Orton brought down the rating a bit. Orton has the potential to be a main event status champion, while Cena is still of course whether or not some fans want to admit it, the champ of the WWE!)

OVERALL: SummerSlam wasn't what I would call the biggest party of the Summer! It wasn't that bad either but after the Diva Battle Royal things went downhill but picked up by the main event.

2701729,3,B000LC3IL0,"Fasten your seatbelts, it's time for the biggest, most amazing party of the su ... no, wait, it's 2007, right? Pity.
No classic matches like Bret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect or Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin.
It's the new millennium, John Cena is World Champion, and Great Khali plays Yokozuna II. Bad omen, huh?

Kane vs. Finlay

In the recent years, Kane continuously switches between Midcard and superstar. And that is not good. We've seen the resurrection of the Undertaker roughly 10 times in the last three years, maybe it would be wise to do the same with Kane, and slip his mask back on his head. He just reminds me of King Of Queens' Spence Olchin way too much.
Fit Finlay on the other hand entered WWE as a midcarder, and that fits nicely; always on the level of good, solid, mediocrity. Of course he's a terrific WRESTLER, but what can you do with wrestling nowadays in WWE?
2/5

Umaga (IC Champ) vs. Kennedy vs. Carlito

Can't stand Kennedy, can't find Carlito amusing, and Umaga doesn't connect with the crowd. The recent three way matches are getting shorter,  increasingly strange, and very uncoordinated. And you should have at least one guy who is able to carry an opponent. Ideally, this should be the champion, but Umaga is too clumsy for that. And Carlito got this title match how? Flair- connection?
2/5

Rey Misterio vs. Chavo Guerrero

Rey Misterio is another example of someone who can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a midcarder or a superstar. And I'm so glad they dropped the whole Eddie Guerrero storyline, so that's a big plus before the match even started.
The match itself didn't have much of a cruiserweight battle, largely because of Chavo. Did you ever notice that Mexican or Japanese cruiserweights, as soon as they enter WWE, immediately lose half of their fire? Apparently someone thinks you have a good highflying match when you see one or two Hurancanranas.
3/5

WWE Diva Battle Royal

Oh, for the love of god, no! It's painful enough to sit through the Women's Title match every three weeks, but, no pun intended, a ""buttload"" of Divas having ... an actual battle royal? I mean, look at Torrie Wilson performing a running splash in the corner - you can actually see her thinking just about not damaging her implants.
-2/5

At that point, MVP entered the ring, challenging Matt Hardy for a beer drinking contest.
Matt introduced his replacement, Steve Austin. Come on, could you folks please just leave the retired superstars alone, and not reduce them to something like this? I'm so very glad the three most important superstars, The Rock, Hogan and Bret Hart have the decency and good judgement to stay at home.
And besides, Austion looks like he had a couple of beer drinking contests too much.
Austin drinks some beer, gives two stunners, and leaves. That made absolutely zero sense, and isn't even entertaining. Because it made zero sense.
0/5

John Morrison (ECW Champ) vs. CM Punk

Does anybody in WWE's ""high offices"" have any idea what ""ECW"" stands for (or stood for, whatever you prefer)? Clearly not. How pathetic is it that a match for the ECW title ends with disqualification because one of the contestants used a chair? That didn't happen in this match, but it DID happen.
I mean, these two rather dull clowns come out, exchange some generic moves, and as soon as Morrison has Punk in a 20 minute headlock, the former ECW viewer just has to go ""what the friggin' hell ...?""
ECW in this shape hurts WWE.
1/5

Triple H vs. King Booker

Let's not kid around, this match was solely there to celebrate the return of Triple H, and it didn't have other purpose - to witness on DVD. It's a good thing it had that bonus because the match itself was a disaster. Barely longer than five minutes, neither Booker nor Triple H made any significant impact. The ending was an acrobatic catastrophe.
And I can't help but think that HHH's return was a little overhyped.
2/5, to be very generous.

World Heavyweight Title
Great Khali vs. Batista

Holy hell, somebody take the title from that 7 foot stain on World Wrestling Entertainment history! At least Andre The Giant was fascinating and charismatic. This was the worst title match (ANY title) in recent memory. After roughly three minutes, Khali takes a chair and hits Batista. DQ victory for the Animal. One question: WTF?
-4/5

WWE Championship Match
John Cena vs. Randy Orton

You can't expect justice in John Cena matches anymore, but at the very least you can count that the crowd is into it. Simply because it's about time Cena gives the title to someone. I mean, at this point, why even bother to build an opponent? Does John Cena need more build up? After beating Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, JBL, 1-2-3? Numerous times.
At this point, watching a Cena match like this one is simply ridiculous! He's beat, wait, not yet ... but now, now, now he's definitely out. Hey, FU, he won!
3/5

This Summerslam surely was nothing to be proud of, but it's enough to satisfy people. Not bad, not great, somewhere right down in the middle of solid mediocrity.
The best thing was Vince McMahon being called ""Vinne - CENzo!""",1190073600,,5112,4.672605790645879
2701730,1,B000LC3IL0,"I can think of about ten different names for the title. This PPV was a house show and no titles changed hands. Khali is still the champion and probably the worst WWE champion of all time. Morrison and Cena retainted the world titles, Triple H and Mistero came back and won (like it would have been any different), and the rest was not important. I saw Kane and Finely fight in a house show and it wasn't speical. I also saw Khali and Batista fight it out and that ended in a DQ as well, and Khali cant wrestle to save his life. Its sad that WWE took the day off and people paid top dollar to see this event when it was a basic house show. WWE is in a rut but they probably dig out of it sooner or later.",1188345600,,703,3.9577464788732395

1. Kane vs. Finlay- This was a decent way to start the show. I would have thought that rey and chavo would have kicked off the show but it was a good choice because that's what kicked off last years summerslam. These two tried the best they could and for there age I will give them a good job. There was even a nice near fall were finlay hit Kane with the Shleghi but Kane kicked out. A decent way to kick off the show. Winner Kane. Match Rating 6/10.
2. Umaga vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Carlito in a triple threat match for the ITC Title- I thought that this was a decent match. These guys put on a decent show and it kept me on the edge of my seat because I thought that Kennedy could possibly win. Just some slid wrestling and lots of near falls but the ending was kind of dumb but besides that a good match. Winner and still ITC Champ Umaga. Match Rating 7/10.
3. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero- This was a good match. I liked this match a lot better than last year's just because it had more hype behind it and I thought that it was better wrestling wise. There was a lot of work on the knee but Rey kept on fighting back and there were a lot of near falls including Rey Kicking out of a Gorry Bomb. A great return for Rey. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.
4. The Divas Battle Royal for the # 1 contender for the WWE Womens Title- Well I was not expecting a lot in this match and it was not good at all. I don't like battle royals a lot anyway but when it's a Divas one its not any better. Just no wrestling here at all and a bore fest but at least we have a new challenger for the womens title. Winner Beth Phoenix. Match Rating 2/10.
5. John Morrison vs. CMP for the ECW World Heavywieght Title- Well I was really looking forward to this match as I was almost sure that CMP was going to win the title. This was a solid match for a while but could have been a little longer. I always thought Morrison had talent but I thought that CMP carried this match. A solid match but a dumb ending ruined this match. Winner and still ECW Champ John Morrison. Match Rating 6.5/10.
6. HHH vs. King Booker with Sharmel- This was a decent match. It was nice to see HHH return as he got a huge ovation. This was a decent match what I think took away from this was we all knew that HHH was not going to lose so it took away from the match but wrestling wise it was solid. Not a bad match. Winner HHH. Match Rating 7/10.
7. The Great Kalhi vs. Batistia for the WHT- Well I did not see the triple threat match at the great American Bash but I heard it was good. Well this match was totally different. This was boring as the great kalhi controlled most of the match. There was a nice near fall were batistia kicked out of Kalhi's finisher but only to lead to a DQ after Kalhi hit Batistia with a steel chair. Not a good match. Winner by DQ Batistia. Match Rating 2/10.
8. John Cena vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title- Well this was the main event and it was not a bad one. The hype going into this match was off the chain as a lot of people believed that Orton was going to win the title. The reaction to Cena was one of the worst I have seen in a while so many Cena sucks chants, break his neck, and Cena must die and I loved it. This was a solid match with some near falls and it lived up to the hype for me. Cena wins again and the reason everyone hates him so much is he wins every single time. Oh well still a good match. Winner and still WWE Champ Randy Orton. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Summerslam 2007 a grade of 47.80 which means this is an awful ppv. I would not say this is an awful ppv but there is no dought that the WHT match and the diva battle royal hurt the score. I will say that it is not a bad dvd to pick up for $15 dollars when it comes out. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that.

2701732,4,B000LC3IL0,"Kane vs Finlay: This was one of the least predictable matches of the night since I expected Finlay to win. Finlay gets a close fall after hitting Kane in his injured ribs with his weapon that I can't spell lol. Kane eventually wins after a chokeslam. 7 out of 10

  Kennedy vs Carlito vs Umaga: Carlito and Kennedy only get near falls when Umaga is laid out outside the ring. Kennedy almost wins but Umaga breaks up the pin on Carlito and right away hits the Samoan Spike on Kennedy for the win. 7 out of 10

  Chavo Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio: In  possibly the best match of the night Rey comes out painted with grey pants and a grey mask. They get many near falls on each othher. Match comes to an end when Rey hits the 6:19 kick on Chavo and splashes him for the win. Despite it being obvious Rey would win from the start, it was still a solid match. 9 out of 10

  C.M Punk vs John Morrison: Back and forth action with many reversals but the wrong person won this one. Morrison pins Punk after having his feet on the ropes. Morrison has some good matches but Punk deserves to be ECW champ way more. 8 out of 10

  King Booker vs Triple: This is a really good match although it was obvious that Triple H wouldn't put Booker over his first match back. The 2 had a better match at one WM but still this is one of the best matches of the night anyway. End comes when Booker fights his way out of a Pedigree but quickly gets hit with one when Triple H trys again. 9 out of 10

  Batista vs The Great Khali: Batista gets shot after shot after shot until he wins the title. So I expected him to win but gee....will he get yet another shot at Unforgiven....um duh...Obviously! Khali controlled the match but gets himself DQ'd for no good reason. So the title matches were disapoiting. 6 out of 10

  Orton vs Cena: I'll just start out by saying ORTON SHOULD'VE WON!! Hell anyway who has versed Cena for the last year in title matches should've beat him! Well except the Great Khali and Umaga. The belt is basically on reserve for Triple H though since I'm already hearing that Cena vs Triple H 2 will happen at WM. So yes we have to put up with Cena's horrible reighn until then! When the 2 Mcmahon's meet, Triple H is married to Stephanie ""why he's pushed so hard"" and Cena must be married to Shane to have the title this long lol.

  Orton hits the RKO and SHOULD'Ve won but when he goes for another the overpushed and annoying Cena hits the FU for the win *PUKES*. Still despite being 100% tired of Cena's reighn, I admit it was a very good match and very watchable but due to me really really wanting Orton to win. 8 out of 10

2701733,3,B000LC3IL0,"This was the 20th annual Summerslam PPV, and I was expecting it to be spectacular and feature some of the greatest 5-star matches I've ever seen. Well, I didn't see any 5-Star matches, but I did see some pretty good ones, but 2 VERY horrible main events.

Kane Vs. Finlay
  This match was just thrown on there at the very last minute for some reason. This feud, if it was a feud, didn't even get started. It didn't even have hornswaggle! I love Finlay and Kane, but these 2 don't work well together in a match. Still it was a decent opener. 6/10

Diva Battle Royal
  I don't really keep up with ANY of the diva matches, all I know is that this was an okay match seeing a LOT of divas trying their best to win. It was just a filler to poddibly give the Women's division a boost. 5/10

Triple Threat for the Intercontinental title: Umaga Vs. Carlito Vs. Kennedy
  This match was very short, but oh so very sweet. I loved this match and is one of the few contenders for Match of the night. Pretty fast paced action, and one of the very few matches where I don't know who to cheer for. Even though Umaga retained, I was still pulling for either of them. Although, it would have been really cool if Kennedy won. But it was very nice seeing Carlito and Kennedy hold their own against Kennedy. It would have been better if it was longer. 8/10

STONE COLD! This segment was worth it alone, seeing Stone Cold come out to a chalening MVP in a beer drinking contest! The only suprise was that Matt Hardy didn't get stunnered, but it was nice seeing Stone cold arrive, drink beer, kick a**, leave. Too bad the US title match was scrapped because of MVP's heart condidition.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Chavo
  This was a very great return match. It was fast paced, and full of crusierweight action. Chavo and Rey have the ability to put on the best dang show, and these 2 work really well together. Nice to see Rey back in the ring. 7.5/10

ECW Championship: John Morrison (c) Vs. CM Punk
  This was definately the best match I have seen from their long feud. It was more fast-paced, and action packed than ever. You really got to see the ROH side of CM Punk in this match. Amazing moves, and I'm glad Morrison retains because he is seriously the best thing ECW has right now, and is the furture of WWE. another Match of the night contender. 8.5/10

Triple H Vs. King Booker
  I was so happy to see HHH back in the ring, and it was weird seeing him with fans seeing as how he was always the heel character, and people never cheer them. Booker T is amazing in the ring, as well as HHH, but he really needs to go back to being Booker T, the King gimmick is way overdone, and only Kurt Angle played the ""king"" role good. Anyways, this match was very good, and nothing like normal return matches. you got to see the best of both of their abilities, and the best of their signature moves. It was a WMXIX rematch, and was very great. On the short side though. The last contender for Match of the Night. 8.5/10

World Heavyweight Championship: Khali (c) Vs. Batista
  What the heck? These 2 can't carry a match for the life of them, so why put them in a match together? And how many more times will we see Batista get a title shot and lose? I'm so tired of seeing Batista, he is stale and isn't as good as he was before the injury. Khali is a huge waste of space, and can't wrestle, so why did WWE decide to give him the gold? This match was terrible. 7 minutes long, and 3 1/2 was a lame shoulder grip by Khali. Terrible, terrible match. 3/10

WWE Title match: John Cena (c) Vs. randy Orton
  Well, I wasn't upset with thismatch. I wanted Randy to win, but I knew it wasn't gonna happen because Cena overcame the odds, again. I'm so tired of Cena having the stupid spinner title, it's making me not want to watch WWE at all. This match was very good however. I was so glad to see these 2 finally put in a match against eachother since they came to WWE the same time. Too many headlocks form Randy, but it was a great bakc and forth match. pretty fast-paced and Randy pretty much had Cena down the whole match, but, as always, Cena pulled the 5 moves of doom out and won. I'm not complaining because this match was pretty good, but please give someone else the belt! 7/10

So overall, this PPV was good. 2 weak PPV's, but 3 VERY good matches and a few decent ones. I would suggest buying this DVD when its at a reasonable used price. The triple threat, HHH return, Stone Cold, and Morrison/Punk match are worth it.

I compare this to Summerslam 2002, a VERY weak main event, but the undercard is what makes the PPV awesome. overall, I give this PPV a 7.5/10.

8160783,3,B000LC3IL0,"Summerslam 07 was the second show I saw on PPV (I've only been a fan since early 07). I loved it at the time.

But I just rewatched the show on DVD, and it's definitely not as good as I thought it was. It's just average after another view.

Let's have a rundown of the card:

Kane vs Finlay
This match was just ok, but it served it's purpose, which was to get the New Jersey crowd fired up for the rest of the show. Both men put a lot of effort in, with Finlay working on Kane's ribs for the majority of the match. There was a Hornswoggle appearance, and it was amusing when he saw Kane sit up and ran away. The match ended when Kane chokeslammed Finlay after a shilleagh shot that didn't keep Kane down. (3/5 - an alright match)

Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Umaga (champion) vs Mr. Kennedy vs Carlito
This match was confusing because the fans didn't know who to cheer for, as all three were heels at the time. There was a funny moment at the beginning when Kennedy tried to reason with Umaga to tell him to team up against Carlito, but Umaga just smacked Kennedy instead. Carlito & Kenndy did end up double-teaming Umaga, but Umaga overcame them both and won the match. This should have had a face in it for the fans to cheer for, but otherwise it was an ok match. (2.5/5 - confusing and nobody the fans can really cheer for)

Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero
This was Rey's return match after being away since 2006. He got a great crowd reaction, but his getup was bizarre, the silver paint looked ridiculous and was coming off right from the beginning of the match. This match was really just a way for Rey to get revenge for Chavo shattering his knee. But some great moves were displayed by both men, including Chavo doing both the Gory Bomb and the three Amigos, and Rey pulling out his match winning 619. Rey picks up the win and gets his revenge. (3/5 - good return for Rey)

WWE Diva Battle Royal (winner gets a WWE Women's Championship match)
Maria vs Mickie James vs Beth Phoenix vs Melina vs Jillian Hall vs Torrie Wilson vs Victoria vs Michelle McCool vs Kristal vs Layla vs Kelly Kelly vs Brooke
This match was actually pretty good. It was a way to get all the divas involved (Candice Michelle, who was champion, watched from ringside) in the PPV. Some good wrestling moves were displayed, mainly from divas like Mickie, Melina & Beth. However Mickie was eliminated too early. Michelle did do an impressive kick to Beth as the last two divas remaining. Beth eliminated Michelle to win. An amusing element is King's commentary, especially when he says ""JR, you'll have to do most of the commentary because my smile is permanently affixed to my face"" and when he says his eyeballs are happy. (3.5/5 - much better then the usual divas stuff and King is funny)

Between the divas and the next match was a segment between MVP and Matt Hardy. MVP complained he was left out of Summerslam, and then said he was ""lowering"" himself to have a beer drinking contest with Matt Hardy. Matt came out and told MVP he'd arranged a substitute. The glass broke, and the great Stone Cold came out! He mocked MVP for a minute, and then stunned him and had a beer bash. It was great seeing Stone Cold as usual, he's always welcome on a WWE PPV to me.

ECW Championship Match
John Morrison (champion) vs CM Punk
Morrison & Punk had some great matches in 2007, but this definitely not one of the best. It was rather boring to be honest, and I found myself wanting it to be over. No offence to either Morrison or Punk though. In the end, Morrison pulled out the victory. (2/5 - a very dull match in my opinion)

Triple H vs King Booker
This match was a way to welcome Triple H back from injury and for Booker to get his comeuppance after all his antics on Raw in the weeks leading up to Summerslam. The funniest thing about this match was King and JR's commentary, they were totally biased against Booker, hoping he'd lose. A funny line was when King commented that someday Booker might have a knee injury and asked JR if he'd miss him, to which JR replied, curtly, ""No."" Triple H's entrance got the crowd on their feet, and he looked very pleased to be back. The match wasn't much, it was basically Triple H beating Booker up with Booker getting in the occasional shot. Triple H won, and everybody gave him a standing ovation, including King and JR. (3/5 - just for Triple H's return and King & JR's commentary)

World Heavyweight Championship Match
The Great Khali (champion) vs Batista
This was a horrible match, not Summerslam standard AT ALL. Khali is a bad wrestler, and Batista didn't have much to work with here. The only memorable moments were Batista's spinebuster on Khali and the spear after the match was over. Speaking of the end, it was a total cop-out on Khali's part. He hit Batista with a chair and got disqualified. A DQ in a Summerslam main event? Ridiculous. Batista went nuts after the DQ and hit Khali with the chair numerous times. Not good at all. (2/5 - what were they thinking with the ending?!)

WWE Championship Match
John Cena (champion) vs Randy Orton
This match saved the PPV for me. It's easily the best match John & Randy have had together. The crowd was also into it, the amount of varying shouts for both John & Randy were tremendous (Let's Go Cena! Cena Sucks! Let's Go Orton! Orton Sucks!). But the crowd couldn't make up their minds. First they booed John, then after the match's conclusion, they cheered him. The match itself was pretty good, but Randy needs to lay off the lengthy headlocks, they're NOT entertaining at all. John kept the pace going, and when Randy hit the RKO I jumped out of my seat because I thought he was going to win (I'm a John fan, so I didn't want him to win). But then John hit the FU and won the match. A good main event that saved the PPV from 2 stars. (4/5 - marked down a star cos of Randy's headlocks, but still very good)

There's two extras on the DVD, one is a match from Smackdown with Kane vs The Great Khali - the match comes in at the end, so it's really more of the aftermath of the match, where Khali beats Kane, Finlay comes out and hits Kane with the shilleagh and then Batista runs out and attacks Khali, but Khali applies the vice grip on him and he passes out. The other extra is Carlito's Cabana  from Raw with Triple H & Vince McMahon. It's hilarious cos Triple H is up to his usual tricks, and brings out numerous women who could have had Vince's son - one of them is Carlito's ""sister"" and one is actually a man. Vince is horrified, then leaves the ring after telling Triple H he hates him, Carlito then spits apple in Triple H's face, so Triple H attacks him. Very funny stuff.

Overall, this was just an average Summerslam. It wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't horrible either. The SD main event was easily the worst match of the night, the Raw main event was the best. Everything else was either good (Triple H's return), alright (divas battle royal, Rey vs Chavo & Kane vs Finlay) or confusing (Intercontinental match). I give it 3 stars.",1251849600,,7050,4.404761904761905

Rey Mysterio V. Chavo Guerrero
The return of Rey and what a return! great match here with great in ring work and storytelling. Of course Rey wins in his return. ***3/4. Chavo was very good as a heel here. If with the right people, he could be a main event heel...HAHAHAHA...joking. But, Chavo is dieing in his position now. He is better than what people give him credit for.

ECW Championship:
John Morrison (Champion) V. CM Punk
I really don't get why they keep putting those two together, they have no chemistry at all. This is the three straight PPV that those two have worked together and all the matches have sucked and this one was no different. Just barely watchable because of Punk and Morrison is a better tag team wrestler than singles wrestler. Morrison wins by cheating. *1/2

Triple H V. King Booker
The return of The Game and I was actaully disappointed. This match was good, but not as good as their WrestleMania XIX match. Booker was on his way out and his effort wasn't there and Triple H was just returning, but, this match could have been better. Triple H wins. ***

World Heavyweight Championship:
Great Khali (Champion) V. Batista
Just one word. Horrible. This is the third straight Summerslam with horrible World Heavyweight Title matches and Batista has been in them all. Batista wins by DQ after Khali destroys him for the whole match and Batista gets a spinebuster in and Khali is afraid. Big Baby. 1/4* I hope the World Heavyweight Championship match at this year's Summerslam will be alot better than 2005, 2006, and 2007. Can anyone say Punk V. Cena?????

WWE Champioship:
John Cena (Champion) V. Randy Orton
what a match!! The best WWE Championship match at a Summerslam since Angle/Lesner in 2003. Awesome storytelling and wrestling in this one. Match of the night and match of the year canadiate. Awesome. Cena retains. DAMN....NO...****

Overall a so-so Summerslam. The return of Rey was great, Triple H's return was good too, but Booker sucks so you can't really say much. The WWE Championship was the best in 4 years and the other matches were just an after thought.",1215475200,,2930,4.832335329341317

-Kane vs Finlay:Stupid Storyline. I though it started slow and then got fast,in the beggining i just stared at Finlays Boots then it got fast paced,Interference and many more. Kane Wins with a Chokeslam.(6/10)
-Umaga vs Carlito vs Kennedy for IC Title:Well this match had no DQ so it got interesting,fast paced action Umaga shows his strenght,Carlito and Kennedy team up against him and Kennedy Hits Umaga with a TV!Everyone thought Kennedy would win but Umaga Retained!(7/10)
-Rey vs Chavo:i don't remeneber this match very much but i know there are some botches and some higflying action.nice 619.(7.5/10)
-Womens Battle Royal:Lots of normal stuff,nothing amazing only that McCool was eliminated last,BEth becomes NB.1 contender. (5.5/10)
-Morrison vs Punk:Morrison wins i don't rember anything
-HHH vs Booker T:The Match Everyone wanted to see,HHH receinved a LOUD ovation,but his in ring skill got worse,he was very sloppy and slow in this match so 6.9/10  for sloppy Pedigree that didn't look painfull
-Batista vs Khaly:khaly used a chair and won (0/10)
-Cena vs Orton:classic match of the night u have to see it urself (8/10)!",1206489600,,1248,5.117647058823529

Kane vs. Finlay

This match was only added to the pay per view two days before on smack down, so it was like a filler opener match. This match was real physical. Finlay works on Kane's leg and ribs through the match. Kane entertained the crowd while Finlay did his thing witch made this actually good. 6 /10

Triple Threat match
WWE Intercontinental Championship match
Ken Kennedy vs. Carlito vs. Umaga

This was interesting because there was only heels in this match. I think it would have been better if they added Jeff. Still this was good but not the best triple threat match. The crowd was cheering for Kennedy in this match. Him and Carlito double team Umaga but he comes back an wins. Okay match. 7/10

Chavo vs Rey Misterio

This was Rey's return match and he came looking weird cover in something and at first I didn't think that was him until all that stuff rubbed off. Any way, this match was awesome. Rey did some nice high flying moves while Chavo worked on his injured leg. I would say this was match of the night. 8/10

Divas Inventional Battle Royal

This match was just a waste of time. They should of just added something else ton the ppv so people can forget about this. 2/10

ECW Championship match
John Morrison vs. CM Punk

This match was cool. This hole Morrison gimmick thing is okay. The both of them do a good job with their fued and they put on some good matches together. I wished it could have been extreme rules match but oh well. 7.5/10

Triple H vs. King Booker

This was Triple H return match and King Booker's last match on a WWE ppv. This match was hyped over many weeks and it felt like the match could have been a lot better. I liked to see Booker do the Houston hangover because I haven't seen him do that in a while. Okay match. 7/10

World Heavyweight match
The Great Khali vs. Batista

They should of added a gimmick to this match like a no dq match of some thing hardcore to take the place for the ECW match. It was boring just like the crowd said. 1/10

WWE Championship match
John Cena vs. Randy Orton

This match was nice. Randy showed off his skills real good. Cena did yet his usual things in this match. I really thought Randy was going to win but no. Still very good match. 8/10

Okay ppv but could have been better.",1197936000,,2327,4.3004587155963305
