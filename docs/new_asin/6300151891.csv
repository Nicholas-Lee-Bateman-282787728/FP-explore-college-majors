213647,2,6300151891,"This is a an old TV movie covering the Attica prison uprising in the early 1970s. Its based on reporter Tom Wicker's book ""a time to die"". Its interesting as a curiosity more than as a great film. From an acting point of view, its slightly interesting because its the genesis of Morgan Freeman's stock film character that he made a whole career out of in the decades after. And he out-acts everyone else in the film.

The film gets through the initial takeover in about 13 minutes. It does a really bad job of establishing the prisoners grievances. In particular it talks about them rather than shows them and makes a real strong point about an incident in California rather than points in the prison.

Then the film gets to its real subject: the ego of reporter Tom Wicker. Tom Wicker is drawn broadly as the only ""sane"" character while everyone else is generally done as stick-figures. Wicker is always right. Wicker is always wise. Wicker is always the one with the plan. But he can't get too involved (even though he is involved) because he is a journalist first. There is a weird moment where he declines a position of responsibility because it would get in the way of filing his stories. They even do a special set-piece to tell us that Wicker is the moderate heart of america criticized by both left and right.

William Kunstler is portrayed as completely cynical and the film has him at Attica strictly to bring attention when the prison is (in his view) inevitably retaken. Bobby Seele is shown coming in, taking what amounts to a bow and then leaving. The film then has the other characters offer explanations and sympathy for Seele doing nothing.

Eventually, Wicker personally goes to seek amnesty for the inmates from the local district attorney and then negotiates something less than full amnesty. The film however tells us over and over again that anything less that total amnesty for every act during the riot will never be acceptable.

They eventually get a point where William Kunstler is sort-of given implicit blame for the rejection of the Tom Wicker deal by the inmates and in some sense the violence that follows. That is less than entirely fair.

Having implicitly said one thing, they then move to the line that the entire crisis can be resolved if Nelson Rockefeller just comes in person to the prison to negotiate. The film itself realizes its lack of logic at this point and has Wicker claim that bringing in Rockefeller is just a stunt to buy time in the hope that hunger will make the prisoners give up. That doesn't make much sense either, but it keeps the narrative the film wants on track.

In the final meeting with the inmates, the film has them threatening to kill the observers. Another strange choice. They have Kunstler almost gleefully happy when the inmates reject any final compromise. Wicker says that its suicide. They have Kunstler say that the inmates are ""men"" and that have a right to their own decision.

The last ten minuets are just a violent set-piece of the riot being put down. It ends completely over the top with Tom Wicker literally crying.

The very end is a narration when Wicker blames the men. In his view, in taking hostages, the inmates had adopted the ""violence and inhumanity"" of the system they were protesting. Wicker then says that if everyone had simply been willing to ""strip away their labels"" that there could have been a peaceful outcome.

An odd film. It constantly deals in mixed messages but perhaps given that it could never please everyone politically, that is the best it could do. There is a fair amount of hate directed toward William Kunstler but since its Wicker's word only for these events, its difficult to know how accurate the portrayal is. From start to end, the film however shows off Tom Wicker is a real egomanic. The book the film is based on is in my opinion equally bad with Wicker's literary pretensions overcoming his instincts as a journalist.",1410652800,7,3942,4.691751085383502
213648,4,6300151891,"I was living in Lima, Ohio in the early '80's when the call went out for extras needed for this movie about Attica. It was filmed in Lima Correctional Facility for the Criminally Insane as the building's structure closely resembled Attica's arcitecture. I was a paid extra for 3 nights and days of filming the scenes when the prisoners stormed the grounds, and the scenes when the National Guardsmen opened fire on the prisoners. Fun experience. Of course when it was broadcast as a ABC 2-night Movie of the week, I could not find myself among the 100 or so extras and the chaos of the ensuing riot scenes.

I notice on the specs that it is listed as having a 96 min run time. Is this accurate? I could've sworn it was broadcast as a two-part, 4 hours special. Is this version seriously edited? Anyone.",1406851200,3,802,4.493150684931507

7803814,5,6300151891,"Vietnam-era radicalism peaked at two critical points: the Kent State shootings of May 4, 1970; and here - the Attica Uprising of September, 1971.  In both cases those who would disrupt the system - for all the democratic liberalism of official doctrine - paid the price in blood.  This TV movie was filmed in 1980, when the events and period were still relatively fresh, and well captures their spirit.  As a TV film the acting is sometimes wooden and canned, but overall it's still a good dramatic piece and drives it point like a nail to the head.

As is typical in such scenarios, the guard-hostages were killed by their would-be rescuers.  This was falsely attributed to the prisoners, as in the Moscow theater ""rescue"" thirty years later: though at least Russia is stepping up to American standards of collateral damage.  Such a production would not be made today.  The prisoners' actions would be condemned as terrorism and there would be no question of instant and bloody retaliation: no negotiators, no offering of 28 points, no seeing things from the prisoners' POV.  Contrast the reaction to this massacre with the assassination of Osama bin Ladn to see how times have changed, and not for the better.",1491177600,,1211,4.844660194174757

7803820,5,6300151891,"The 1980 TV movie ATTICA is directed by Marvin Chomsky (he made a career of TV series episodes and televison films). The cast features Charles Durning as Prison Commissioner Oswald, Morgan Freeman, as a peaceful prisoner who doesn't want trouble, David Harris as the main instigator, George Grizzard as newspaperman Tom Wicker, an eyewitness of events in those dark 1971 days, also Henry Darrow as Bronx borough president Herman Badillo, Roger E. Mosley, Paul Lieber, Anthony Zerba and in a small role, Andrew Duggan.

The story moves briskly. We're told that a recent prisoner death at San Quentin has everyone on edge. An inmate spokesman meets briefly with Commissioner Oswald with a list of grievances and desired changes, most of which are immediately agreed to. Yet after an argument between two Cellblock One prisoners and the isolation of one of them, nearly a thousand inmates force their way into the yard, taking 42 guards hostage. The scene is nightmarish, an angry mob brandishing clubs, shovels and anything else that will serve as weapons.

At this point, Freeman acts as one of the negotiators in a tinderbox situation, but now he's totally on the side of the other inmates, where before he couldn't understand why they made trouble and just didn't ""do their time.""

This Prisoners' Rights Movement incident, a violent true happening, had reverberations throughout the rest of the '70s.",1445817600,4,1402,5.086956521739131
