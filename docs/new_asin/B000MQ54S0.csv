8170861,5,B000MQ54S0,"I saw this movie on TV5 and loved it. Living in Louisiana, I have been to events where most of the people speak French. True, it is not  Parisian French, but is French. What I liked about this movie is that Michel Blanc's character was essentially that of the French of Louisiana: practical, no nonsense, intelligent and kind with just a bit of simple ""tricherie."" It is a wonderful movie that should be available in our regional format.",1319500800,,437,4.602564102564102
8170862,5,B000MQ54S0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is both funny and serious. I too look forward to being able to buy it and keep it in my library to show others. Tears were streaming down my face at the end because it was so heart warming.

Beware buying the Spanish version as it does not have english subtitles. It has spanish subtitles only.",1308960000,,330,4.32258064516129

8170864,5,B000MQ54S0,"I too saw this film on a transatlantic flight, and find it a gem.  I hope that it will soon become available in the USA at a more reasonable price.  It is both comical, heart-warming, and gives insight into a component of French and Romanian culture and society.  I think that there are many potential viewers of this film, who would enjoy it as much as I.",1180828800,2,356,4.2835820895522385
8170865,5,B000MQ54S0,"I first saw this movie in the spring of 2006 on an Air France flight to Paris, and have eagerly been awaiting its arrival in the North American market.  Although the plot may be somewhat predictable, the story takes several twists and turns along the way to the conclusion.  Unlike other films with similar plots (e.g., Femme a Menage/The Housekeeper), the story in this film is much more believable, and by the end, you really feel for the characters.  As a scholar of women's and gender studies, I also liked the fact that the story is set in the context of current economic difficulties within the European Union, and portrays some of the larger difficulties facing women trying to support their families.  I highly recommend this film.",1173398400,5,739,4.7952755905511815
