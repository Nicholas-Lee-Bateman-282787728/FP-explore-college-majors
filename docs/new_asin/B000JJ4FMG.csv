8150744,5,B000JJ4FMG,"For anyone who loves nature and classical music, this is a must-see. With a narrative that emphasizes the spiritual ""essence"" of this wondrous park paired with gorgeous classical music, this video transports you into a calm and spiritual place.  As a Wyoming native who has seen this park many times, I never ever get over the beauty and absolute wonders that make up this ecosystem.  A good balance of narrative and ""quiet"" with music and scenes make this a great viewing experience. I highly recommend this to any nature lover!",1230508800,6,529,4.866666666666666
