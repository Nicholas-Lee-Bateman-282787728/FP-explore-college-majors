7990634,1,B00009EIQQ,"It appears that at long last, the real ""Cold Feet"" is coming to DVD on our side of the pond.  The U.S. release date is January 25, 2005!! Looks like it's only the first season, but hopefully the whole series will be released as well.  I can't wait!",1100563200,,248,4.145833333333333
7990635,5,B00009EIQQ,"I agree Cold Feet is a must see British series.  I've seen all seasons.  Worth getting a multiregional DVD player.  Easy to order online.  I have an RJ Tech only $150.  Plus if you like The Office, the Christmas episode that aired on BBC last year (not available in the US) is soon to be released through Amazon.co.uk in October.",1093737600,,329,4.416666666666667
7990636,1,B00009EIQQ,"As another reviewer said, the, ""Better Together: Buy this DVD with The Office"" is extremely misleading. The Office is an excellent British television programme, and Cold Feet is an excellent British television programme, BUT THIS DVD IS NOT IT! You can buy the DVDs of the British television programme Cold Feet from amazon.co.uk.
Reviewer rating:
Five stars for Cold Feet the British television programme
One star for Amazon trying to make you buy the wong DVD by mistake.",1083024000,7,473,5.076923076923077
7990637,1,B00009EIQQ,"Despite Amazon's reference to other British television shows as ""similar"" to this show, this DVD is NOT the award-winning British television show ""Cold Feet.""
If you want to watch ""Cold Feet,"" you'll have to buy it from Amazon's UK site (www.amazon.co.uk) and then get yourself a region free dvd player (the Philips DVD 727, which is sold at Amazon.com can be modified using a method described in the reviews of that product).
By the way, if you're considering buying the British television show Cold Feet, I highly recommend it.  It is an excellent television show, worthy of airtime in the U.S. (though I don't think its ever been on here).",1072656000,55,642,4.836363636363636
