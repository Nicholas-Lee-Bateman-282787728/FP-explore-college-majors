8729675,3,B0145JUWAO,I enjoyed the movie but it did break my sons heart a little. Maybe 10 years old or kids who take things to heart this would not be a good movie.  But my husband and I thought it was great we just had to explain a lot to him. About life and death. He's never known anyone who is sick so that was a little stab in the heart but we are glad we bought it for him.,1479254400,,359,3.6025641025641026
