8578493,4,B000TJT9YK,"I made this DVD in 1988 when only VHS was available. The money designated to make this video was not used wisely and my shoot was only one day and I was not available for the editing process. The original DVD was similar to the VHS so the golfer had to endure 113 minutes and there were no chapters. Now there are 16 chapters on teh DVD as well as 21 chapters on the book Golf-O-Metrics. This DVD contains a lot of information but most importantly you get to see the man that as a boy met and knew the likes of Walter J. Travis, Alexander Findlay and Harry Vardon. You get to see the man who taught golf from 1910 to 1990. You get to see and hear the man that influenced Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and 100's of other playing professionals. You get to hear understand Joe's history as spoken from Joe Norwood himself. He gives lessons that were given to him when he was a teenager. This DVD is a great tribute to Joe Norwood.",1395532800,,918,4.162921348314606
