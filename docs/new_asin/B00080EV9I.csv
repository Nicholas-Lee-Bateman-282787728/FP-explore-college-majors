2255277,5,B00080EV9I,"This film is an absolute joy! It's a sweet, tender and funny love story that will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy. Hugh Laurie is his usual sexy, irresistible, fantastic self (the character he plays in this film could be correctly described as the ""anti-House"") and Vanessa Nunes is an complete knockout. If you love a good old fashioned love story with a real Hollywood ending then you'll love this dvd!",1165708800,6,409,4.694444444444445
2255278,5,B00080EV9I,"Another amazing side to Hugh Laurie. Who know on top of everything else,who knew Hugh Laurie could dance so sensual. I love it and if you have a crush on Hugh like I do, you'll  love it too.",1151193600,4,190,4.0
2255279,3,B00080EV9I,"I love Hugh Laurie in the TV show HOUSE, and when I purchased this film, I think I was looking for THAT Hugh Laurie. character.  Of course, there is only one HOUSE!  Hugh Laurie is good in the film (which is a comedy), but depicts a completely different character.  To see a funny side of Hugh Laurie, I would recommend the film.",1140825600,8,329,4.274193548387097
2255280,5,B00080EV9I,"Not sure if this movie opened in the US, but due to Hugh Laurie's role in the show, ""House"" the DVD is now available.  Very cute story, cute girl, and a nice mix of comedy.",1124064000,9,172,3.914285714285714
2255281,4,B00080EV9I,"A very watchable comedy movie.

The very simple story revloves around Raymond Wood (the wonderful Hugh Laurie) who works for a small Bank in the city of London. He seems to be in a (classic) mid-life crisis. Raymond's wife is having an affair with his boss, who doesn't like Raymond one bit and has been denying him promotion for two years in a running. Raymond loves Samba dance, harbors a day dream to visit Rio and dance with Orlinda (a very famous Samba carnival dancer). On a whim, Raymond steals lots of money from his bank and catches a direct flight to Rio. He runs into a clumsy Taxi driver, Pablo who takes him on a joy ride all across Rio. He also helps Raymond meet with Orlinda (the very gorgeous Vanessa Nunes). Raymond falls for Orlinda and this starts a chain of interesting events, brushes with the Mafia, street chases and great escapes.

The foot-tapping and soul-tickling Samba music is amazing (will make you run to the nearest music store to grab a copy). Rio provides a beautiful backdrop (reaffirming it as the Planet's most beautiful city).

Hugh Laurie plays his part to perfection and you'll probably won't get enough of Vanessa Nunes.",1123632000,65,1162,4.686274509803922
2255282,3,B00080EV9I,"Suspend all disbelief and have a good time. Once again,  Hugh Laurie is  handed a role that's somewhat beneath him, but he makes the best of it. He plays the victim so well and isn't half bad as a samba dancer, either, but the film turns so silly at times that it's a little embarrassing to watch.  Laurie's comic style is a bit like the young Dick Van Dyke's: very physical. His years in vehicles like ""Blackadder"" and ""Jeeves & Wooster"" have shown, however, that he's capable of much more refined and esoteric comedy, and his role in ""House"" demonstrates his depth as a dramatic actor as well. Although he's perfect for this role, I feel his talents are rather wasted here.  The locales and music, however, are superb, and the huge dance & drum number is breathtaking. I'm going to go out to buy some samba CDs now.",1122768000,29,817,4.4630872483221475
2255283,4,B00080EV9I,"Coming to this film with low expectations, I was happily surprised to find this a diverting, charming, and sweet confection.  My initally sceptical teenage boys also watched it with great satisfaction, enjoying in particular the wonderful  scenery of Rio and the gorgeous legs of co-star Vanessa Nunes.  I found Hugh Laurie believably naive and awkward as the cuckolded London bank officer who takes off on the trip of his fantasies to Rio.  And he really did pull off the sexy samba scenes quite well! As a fan of his hit TV show ""House,"" it was a treat to see this great actor in a completely different role.",1122595200,23,610,4.672897196261682
2255284,5,B00080EV9I,"Girl from Rio is such a sweet, funny, charming movie! Hugh Laurie plays a bank under-manager named Raymond Wood who leads a boring life except for his passion for samba dancing. While Raymond is teaching dancing at night, his wife is having an affair with his hateful boss. When Raymond discovers this, he decides to pursue his dream of meeting and dancing with the beautiful Brazilian samba dancer Orlinda, and the rest is pure fun.

Laurie is just wonderful in this as an upright Englishman whose life changes for the best on what he thinks is the worst day of his life. In addition to the dancing, he does some marvelous physical comedy.

If you like sweet romantic comedies, you will really like this movie.",1120780800,13,711,4.68
2255285,5,B00080EV9I,"Hugh Laurie is so cute!  Absolutely adorable, and love his dancing abilities in this movie.",1265587200,,91,5.066666666666666
2255286,5,B00080EV9I,"I loved this movie.
It's just pure fun.
And of course, it has Hugh Laurie in it,
it has to be a great movie!",1260921600,,108,3.5416666666666665
2255287,2,B00080EV9I,"This is an over-the-top romantic comedy - not a great script, but not terrible. There was enough there that the movie might have been good except for one fatal weakness: the dancing was awful. As Hugh Laurie says in his cast interview, the Raymond character is supposed to come alive when he dances, transform from drab to electrically sexy. Laurie just wasn't able to pull this off. I love Hugh Laurie - I'm a huge fan of House - but he was badly miscast. He has no physical grace, and can't dance at all. Nunes' dancing was a little better, but still not great. Why did they not use real dancers in a film where dancing is so central? Neither Laurie nor Nunes had ever danced before the film. Also, there was oddly little chemistry between them. Nunes is gorgeous, though - perfect body.",1257811200,,789,4.486111111111111
2255288,1,B00080EV9I,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
The only good thing about it was Vanessa Nunes. (Beautiful woman!)
Otherwise, awful acting, awful composition, awful directing and so on.
Just plain embarassing.

With good direction, it could have had potential.

Try ""Woman On Top"" with Penelope Cruz. Not that it was a ""great movie""
but it was sensual, loaded with great Bossa Nova music
(no Bossa Nova in ""Girl from Rio"") and lots of beautiful Penelope. Kinda strange
but compelling.",1211846400,,485,4.902439024390244
2255289,2,B00080EV9I,"I bought this movie hoping for a great romantic comedy featuring Hugh Laurie. Okay, so this wasn't it--plus it was a copy from a VHS tape and the quality was not high. It's worth borrowing from a library or renting but not buying. I enjoyed watching Laurie and Nunes (pleasant personalities and both very attractive) and the samba was great fun. But all in all very ""lite."" The two engaging interviews with the leads tells you what a super film this might have been with a stronger script. Even romantic comedy needs to take it's story seriously enough to make you really care about the characters.",1200787200,3,598,4.650943396226415
2255290,5,B00080EV9I,"I purchased this movie cause I am Hugh Laurie fan. And I was delightfully suprised. When I saw Hugh dancing samba, he just took my breath away! He was so sexy. The whole story was fun, sweet and surprising. If you like Hugh Laurie, Vanessa Nunes and/or samba you musn't miss the opportunity to have this movie.",1192233600,4,310,4.456140350877193
2255291,3,B00080EV9I,"While the movie itself was a little hokey, Hugh Laurie was delightful in his leading role of the banker flying to Rio to meet his ""dream samba girl.""",1181260800,,149,4.357142857142857
2255292,3,B00080EV9I,"Fun, Hugh Laurie is very good as expected.  Rio is so beautiful and her SAMBA is great.",1180051200,3,87,4.117647058823529
2255293,5,B00080EV9I,"I checked out Girl From Rio as a pre-House Hugh Laurie fan and a dance enthusiast.  It's turned out to be one of my very favorite movies.  I do like pretty light-weight stuff but I also appreciate good acting, casting, and direction.  The characters are absolutely charming, the music and dancing are quite thrilling.  Loved the way all the scenes were shot, from a funny old cab racing around the back-streets of Rio to London at night or the gorgeous Orlinda walking upstairs in a fringed red mini-skirt.  It seems to start slowly but then the plot never lets up.  Everything about the movie gets more exciting and colorful and it ends leaving the viewer satisfied and ready to dance.  Watch for the aerial shots of both countries and dancing holiday crowds in Rio.",1169942400,8,767,4.67910447761194
2255294,4,B00080EV9I,"Cute, romantic comedy of a screwball English banker who dreams of a samba dancer, only to rob the bank he works for and fly to Rio to meet her!

""House"" fans will be shocked to hear Laurie's perfect British accent and his comedic genius.

Laurie proves he is a very versatile performer.",1168300800,6,286,4.480769230769231
8055033,5,B00080EV9I,"My DVD arrived and I was very excited. I spent a long time waiting and searching for a copy of this film that would play in the US. Most versions of this film were either for the wrong region or would cancel by the seller before I could receive the product. That was not the case here! It arrived and as advertised the back cover was missing(a little odd, but expected) and beyond that was in very good condition. I watched the film and remembered why I liked it so much in the first place. It's a cheesy comedy that could be modernized in a remake today. It's a movie I still enjoy and I'm so glad to have it in my collection.",1503446400,,627,4.105691056910569
8055034,5,B00080EV9I,"I love this film it fills my cup and cheers my soul....there is a buzz of happiness to escape the troubled times of suburban marriage and City of London past and time to celebrate with a sack full of stolen cash with a one way ticket to Rio that can seem to offer a freedom in expression of the music of Samba! Or something like that he says in character of Raymond (played by Hugh Laurie)

The opening credits give us a clue of things to come....with a split image divided in two, with the mood of music shifting from traditional English brass to the very creative world of South American music to discover....

The film is inspired from the Ealing comedies of fifty years ago....and is the best film to follow from this genre of comedy.....There is more that I can say......and I will say that DESAFINADO is played with deep tenor saxophone by Stan Getz....and this is the alternative and famous BOSSA NOVA that Im sure that you already know?...... I love the dance procession led by the beautiful and charming Brazilian actress, Vanessa Nunes......The Brazilian taxi driver is wonderfully eccentric, played by Santiago Segura, who reminds me of a lighter version of Gerald Depardieu....

The film is incredible to its attention to detail -to shape and tone and colour the atmosphere of London and Rio with beautiful film image  music too  with a mix of comical characters that will cluster around Raymond and make you laugh out load. The London Bank of Hogwoods is inspired, and crops up again in a nightmarish dream from Raymond. The three, suspicious workmen viewing Raymond dancing in the bank is creative genius in the style of abstract art! I recommend this film of fun that is directed by Christopher Monger. The film is eccentric to say the least: it lends itself to the magic of love, music and imagination. Fantastic, and Hugh Laurie too!",1464048000,,1850,4.715170278637771

8055037,1,B00080EV9I,"Hugh Laurie is one of my favorite actors. However, this movie was not good (in my opinion).
If you like Hugh Laurie, check out Maybe Baby or Sense and Sense ability.",1389830400,,165,4.354838709677419
8055038,5,B00080EV9I,"I knew Hugh Laurie could act, and sing, but he can also dance too!!! Give it up to him in this movie been addicted, and can't stop watching it!!! Watching Hugh Laurie samba definitely SEXY!!! If your a Hugh Laurie fan I definaty recommend!!!",1367971200,,241,4.5
8055039,4,B00080EV9I,A very entertaining comedy . Hugh Laurie is excellent and the story is very good . Great music and locations. Lots of fun. A movie to keep and watch again and again .,1342828800,,166,4.0606060606060606

8055041,5,B00080EV9I,"watching this movie was great, as I had a stressful day and watching Hugh Laurie, and Vanessa Nunes, dance was worth the price and more.

Both did a super great job in this movie. I plan to add this movie to my Hugh Laurie movie collection.",1296000000,,240,4.217391304347826
8055042,5,B00080EV9I,It is nice when what could have just been a Rom-com or mere comedy has some bite to it.  In many ways this is a true Farce- appropriate given that the male lead spent 4 seasons playing the role of Bertie Wooster in the BBC adaptation of P.G.Wodehose's Jeeves stories.  There are also stong elements of Satire as well.  And some great dancing- which is a lot of fun.  The ultimate happy ending was contrived and there are times when the film is a bit rough around the edges but on the whole this film is well worth watching.,1284249600,,523,4.252525252525253
