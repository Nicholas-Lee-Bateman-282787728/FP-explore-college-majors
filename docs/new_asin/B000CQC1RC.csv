8100305,5,B000CQC1RC,"I read the book of the same name by Friedman and got confused with all the detail.  This A&E program cuts away a lot of the supplementary information and focuses on the main points.  I found the focus interesting.  It has made me want to go back and look at the book and the Bible in a different way.  There is a lot of questions and summations that can be criticized, but in the end it fulfills its purpose---to get you to think about the meaning behind the scriptures and the people of this time.  I have watched it several times, discovering something new with each viewing.  Whether you like or hate the concept of questioning the Bible, this video (and if you read the book) will provoke discussions and thought..",1424908800,,718,4.442748091603053
8100306,4,B000CQC1RC,"This is a very nice summary of Who Wrote The Bible? It looks at this question from a historical, investigative or critical thinking method of analyzing the facts available today. It doesn't take a side but allows the watcher to draw their own conclusions. It leaves you wanting to investigate further. I gave it only four stars because it isn't as thorough on the subject as I would have liked.",1356220800,2,394,4.642857142857143
8100307,4,B000CQC1RC,"If you are looking for an in-depth discussion on all of the authors of the Hebrew bible and the Christian bible, this is not the program for you.  If, however, you are curious about the subject and know little or nothing about it, then I think you'll find this program is well worth your time.

The first half of the program focuses on the Torah, or the first five books of the Hebrew bible.  Although the other books of the Old Testament are also mentioned, the program's focus and attention is squarely on the Torah.  Did Moses write them, as tradition holds?  Or were there several authors?  These questions are examined in depth, augmented with insights and opinions from various religious scholars and academics.

The second half of the program turns to the Christian texts, or New Testament.  Again, tradition holds that Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul wrote the majority of the books...but did they?  In addition to the actual books that are in the New Testament, there is also some discussion on some of the extra-canonical books, like those found at Nag Hammadi in 1945.  The program examines why these texts may have been excluded from the Christian bible.

Overall, a very interesting program, especially for those new to the topic looking for some answers.  I found the program free from bias or any particular bent or interpretation; it presented the facts, and let the viewer decide.

Four stars.  Good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about the origins of the bible!",1327363200,9,1505,4.828125
8100308,5,B000CQC1RC,"For those shoppers, and researchers similar to me which are fans of ""A&E's"" and ""The History Channel's"" television series ""Mysteries of the Bible,"" ""Who Wrote The Bible"" is episode 23 and 24, and accordingly, the 7th, and the 8th episode of season 3 of the series. ""Who Wrote The Bible"" is a two DVD product with the first DVD covering the Old Testament, and the second DVD covering the New Testament. It is hosted, and narrated by Richard Kiley with the Biblical verses narrated by Jean Simmons, and produced by BramRoos Productions for ""A&E."" I have been striving to get every episode of the series ""Mysteries of the Bible"" as not every one is available, and had concerns if this was not one of the episodes, but it is. Like other episodes, many of the scenes are of ""The Holy Land,"" and in the ""Middle East,"" with interviews, and testimonies from the series experts as Professor Lawrence Schiffman, New York University, Rabbi David Wolpe, and Walter Zanger. Some of the other regular experts are not included in this episode such Christopher-Smith (or if I have it wrong Smith-Christopher). The DVD is based on the book ""Who Wrote The Bible?"" written by Richard Elliott Friedman. The only knock I have on this is the cover of the DVD, I wish I would have gotten the Blue with Yellow lettering cover as pictured but I did not. It is the content that matters.",1317600000,8,1360,4.647302904564316
8100309,3,B000CQC1RC,"This documentary may come across as a valid presentation by having all kinds of ""experts"" from various religions and denominations, but anyone who has the basic knowledge on the history of how the Bible came to be would wonder why the ambiguity. And this dvd is LOADED with ambiguity. If you want the direct answer as to who wrote the Bible and how we got it, I strongly suggest you get the dvd Where Did The Bible Come From. It will make some people uncomfortable and others rejoice. I only suggest you get this dvd if you're wise enough to know you're being lied to, but merely wish to be entertained.",1287273600,3,603,4.441441441441442
