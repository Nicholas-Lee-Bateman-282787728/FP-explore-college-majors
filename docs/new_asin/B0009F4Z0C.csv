If you know anything about recording or Pro-Tools, rather just experiment for sounds. If it was about $10-$15 then perhaps it would be worth it.",1208131200,3,293,4.764705882352941
8059921,4,B0009F4Z0C,"On more than one occasion, grizzled recording veterans have said to me, ""To get a great recording, you need a great player on a great instrument in a great room, in front of a great mic, going into a great preamp, through great converters, with playback on great monitors - and THAT's how you get a great recording.""  Russ Long does a fine job of demonstrating that certain elements in this chain (great mics, great preamps) can be replaced without noticeable harm to the end product.

More than that, this DVD provides an admirable introduction to the processes of tracking and mixing.  Those just beginning to get their feet wet will find this DVD a valuable reference as they conduct their own sessions.  The Huber and Runstein book ""Modern Recording Techniques"" might serve as an excellent supplemental text to this DVD.

Engineers who have been tracking for some time and are now looking for a way to take their finished product to a higher level of sonic excellence might, however, be better served by Charles Dye's ""Mix It Like A Record"" DVD.",1178409600,3,1049,4.741758241758242

Had a lot of fun and will watch several times",1163030400,,156,3.727272727272727
8059923,5,B0009F4Z0C,"This DVD takes you through recording two different songs, part by part, with mic setups, audio chain info, settings, and tons of insight that only a top engineer and great studio musicians can express.

One of the two songs was recorded with over $37,000 worth of mics, preamps, compressors, EQ and other cool goodies (not including the main mixer, monitors, hardware and software) and the other song was recorded with nothing but SM-57's (!) and the preamps in a Mackie 1604, at a value of around $1,700 (not including the master mixer, monitors, hardware and software). Both songs sound GREAT, which REALLY illustrates how important good musicianship and solid recording chops are to create a great-sounding recording, regardless of the equipment used.

The DVD is broken into chapters, so you can move from section to section very easily.

The extra features include a section about tuning drums, as well as details about the RADAR/ProTools recording chain that was used.

The DVD also includes a separate disk that contains the data created during the sessions so that you can load it into your DAW and explore each piece of each song.

I found this DVD to be very informative, as well as entertaining.",1150934400,6,1206,4.9504950495049505
