2322197,5,B0009UZFZQ,I have seen both movies before. I like Christian Slater. Both were well acted by the laeading male and female.,1356739200,,110,4.55
2322198,5,B0009UZFZQ,This is a great combo of Christian Slater as the bad boy heartthrob who won the hearts of every teenage girl in the 90s.,1342828800,,120,4.041666666666667
2322199,5,B0009UZFZQ,"I had to buy these films. It was easy to find and order. I was only looking for one, but was really glad this came in the double dvds. I shared with my daughter so she could also enjoy.",1337904000,,185,3.769230769230769
2322200,5,B0009UZFZQ,love christian slater since i was younger 2 movies of his on one dvd was awesome,1280016000,,80,4.0625
2322201,5,B0009UZFZQ,"If you are a Christian Slater fan, both these films are highly recommended.

""Pump up the Volume"" is a good reminder of what life was like before easily shared media, when the FCC had near complete control over all content viewed and used by individuals.

""Bed of Roses"" is a silly romantic tale.  I personally think that Slater's character is more a stalker than a wonderful, romantic guy.  But then my mother just adores him and finds this movie to be the best 'chick flick' ever.  So it might be recommended for a heterosexual girl's night in.

As for the product itself, it's perfect if you don't want any of the usual extra DVD features (Audio commentary, trailers, biographies, making of specials).  The quality is excellent, so if you're only interested in watching the film, the price is perfect.",1242432000,9,804,4.741007194244604

2322208,5,B0009UZFZQ,GOOD DVD! THANKS!,1466640000,,17,5.0
2322209,5,B0009UZFZQ,"Profoundly flawed but wonderful film. I loved this film as a young man and watching MR Robot, in many ways a spiritual sequel to this film lead to me revisiting.

I was impressed by how well a film about radio held up. Slater is wonderful here and doing more than the Nicholson shtick he is usually accused of doing.

And that soundtrack...way ahead of it's time.

Watched this with my girlfriend who had never seen the film and was much too young to be the film's original target audience and she loved it as well, so I feel like even if this film wasn't a part of your adolescence it will still be a rewarding watch.",1466380800,2,618,4.310344827586207

2322221,5,B0009UZFZQ,full disclosure here.  i purchased this for pump up the volume and i have not seen the other film as of this time. pump up the volume could have been released last year and it would be relevant to todays feelings amongst the youth of america. pump calls the authorities out for what they are. c slater delivers one of his better roles here.  most people will enjoy this film. the ones that would not like this are all the people that have their minds shut.  will i see bed of roses  maybe but not yet.,1422489600,5,501,4.1875

2322225,4,B0009UZFZQ,"Two old but good movies.. Particularly pump up the volume..great teen angst movie..
The only problem is the movies are in 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the original 1.78 (actually 1.85)
The transfers aren't too bad for regular dvd",1412985600,2,228,4.871794871794871

2322227,5,B0009UZFZQ,"If you especially like Christian Slater when he was younger, these two movies are a perfect double feature.  One love story (with a happy ending) and one social consciousness.  Either way you get to look at Christian.",1402790400,,217,4.837837837837838
2322228,4,B0009UZFZQ,"I bought this for ""Pump Up the Volume."" For kids who weren't old enough to remember (or weren't born yet), this film made counterculture cool. In the age of the Internet, where seemingly everybody has a blog or a Twitter account, folks might not realize why Slater's character saw his writing and his short-wave radio as the only means for finding his voice. The film is well-acted and has a GREAT script and soundtrack.

""Bed of Roses"" is an utterly formulaic rom-com, but ""Pump Up the Volume"" makes this worth buying.",1394582400,3,519,4.7032967032967035
2322229,4,B0009UZFZQ,"Never seen ""Bed of Roses"" and don't really want to, but it's cheaper than just buying ""Pump Up the Volume"" by itself.  Weird, but whatever.",1385596800,8,139,4.56
2322230,5,B0009UZFZQ,Both of these films are filled with tender moments and real emotions that cause anyone to think about how life operates. I recommend this for older teens on up. Love and life are tender subjects depicted in both of these films! Christian Slater does not disappoint!!,1376697600,,266,4.804347826086956
2322231,3,B0009UZFZQ,"I bought this combo movie set for my husband, since I couldn't find Pump Up the Volume by itself for a better price. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pump Up the Volume. My husband also loves Bed of Roses. It's a little too extreme of a chick flick for me. Gag. The roles are definitely reversed in this house. While both movies star Christian Slater, they are in very different categories. Rebellious teen cult classic vs. stereotypical sappy romance. Meh. They should have paired Pump Up the Volume with one of Slater's other teen cult classics, like Heathers, in my opinion.",1376611200,9,561,4.62
