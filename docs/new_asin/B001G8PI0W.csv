8304474,5,B001G8PI0W,I found Jennifer's advice and tips very clear and helpful...from treating simple colds to everyday maintenance. The massage techniques were especially helpful in treating my daughter's persistent cold and my allergies. My husband and I have spent the last five years cleansing ourselves of unnecessary medicines and chemicals. It's wonderful to have such a great resource available to treat my girls as well as ourselves.,1227225600,2,421,5.492307692307692
8304475,5,B001G8PI0W,"Mommy's ER is invaluable. The thing I like most is the fact that I can complement traditional pediatric treatments with Jennifer Crain's extremely clear and helpful suggestions. She does a fabulous job at cutting through all the Eastern medicine jargon and explaining treatments that are unfamiliar to many in a straight-forward manner. There is absolutely nothing flaky here--it's well-researched, proven treatments from a veteran in the field who is very much in touch with the needs of parents. If you've ever been up in the middle of the night with a feverish child and the Tylenol isn't cutting it, tune in to this DVD. All of you will sleep a lot better!",1225584000,,660,4.901785714285714
8304476,5,B001G8PI0W,This DVD series is awesome. It's so comprehensive and covers the health issues that are major concerns for moms. I just wish it was available to me when I had my first child five years ago and was rushing to the pediatrician every five minutes for minor things. I have had great success with the massage techniques and dietary recommendations for my daughter's constipation. I have also used the spinal rolling and some of the acupressure techniques for my son who is easily overstimulated. I have already recommended this to a friend whose son has ezcema and asthma. She was so excited to see there's something other than steroids that can help her when he is having problems.,1224115200,,677,4.745762711864407
8304477,5,B001G8PI0W,"For any parents hoping to learn how to keep their children healthy without the constant use of antibiotics and over-the-counter medications, Mommy's ER is for you.  What parent doesn't feel confused and guilty running to the pharmacy each time your child gets a fever, cough, runny nose or bellyache?  Mommy's ER empowers you to treat many common, non-life-threatening ailments without the use of drugs or an unnecessary trip to the pediatrician.  And you probably have many of these remedies in your pantry (like prunes, ginger, rice) and don't even know it! - not to mention a loving mother's own two hands!

Mommy's ER was indispensable to me when I couldn't get to the bottom of my 4 year old son's recurrent cough and runny nose.  More importantly, the DVDs taught me how to prevent these problems in the future.  I especially appreciate the dietary recommendations and tips on how to keep the home environment healthy.

Thank you Jennifer Crain for providing such a valuable tool to have under my sleeve at the beginning of each school year!",1224028800,,1047,4.88135593220339
8304478,5,B001G8PI0W,"Mommy's ER has been an extremely useful tool in our household of two children. In each DVD, the ailments are broken down into chapters, so if you need something right away, you can access it immediately. We started watching the segment on allergies, and both my kids (and husband) were so riveted by the DVD, that we just watched the rest of it together! This DVD set is perfect for parents of young children, and for anyone interested in improving or simply maintaining their child's health. There were some great tips on creating a healthier home, and I also learned about things I could be doing differently to improve the health of my children. The DVDs are very informative without being preachy or boring. And it's great to see kids on the DVD doing some of the things mentioned, so you get an idea of how to do things (like the spinal rolling technique to calm kids down...we use this a lot!). Overall, this is an excellent resource for our home, one that we have turned to again and again. I highly recommend it!",1224028800,,1020,4.548913043478261
