8528341,5,B007N8R8ZC,"Looking over my video library I count NINE previous adaptations of the novel Dracula--and that's not counting all the films featuring the vampire count that are not actually based on the book. To that list I'll gladly add THE TERROR OF DRACULA. Writer/director/star Anthony D.P. Mann has given us a movie that while not entirely faithful to the letter of the book, embraces fully the spirit of the book. The titular Count isn't a romantic figure in a frilly shirt seeking undying love, he's an evil creature of the night, come to England in search of new feeding grounds...in a frilly shirt.

Harkening back to an earlier time, THE TERROR OF DRACULA is presented in the style of a ""lost"" Hammer horror flick, and to this end succeeds quite well. It certainly feels like it could be slipped into that catalog. Honestly, it feels more like it belongs than the latter Hammer Draculas where they brought the Count into modern times.

Shot on a very limited budget the movie makes great use of it's star location Fort Henry built in the mid-19th century. The fort, with some creative shooting is an excellent stand-in for Castle Dracula.

The acting, often a weak point on low budget flicks, never dips below competent. Mann excels in the role of Dracula. This is a count that doesn't want to meet your friends, he wants to EAT them. He's a monster in every sense of the word. You know... the guy Stoker actually wrote about in his book.

All in all, a worthy addition to the Dracula canon. If you like the original novel, if you have affection for the days of Hammer, if you like indie movies with ambition, I can't imagine this movie disappointing you.

If you're looking for sparkling and whining...well... you might wan to try elsewhere.",1336780800,,1736,4.678688524590164
