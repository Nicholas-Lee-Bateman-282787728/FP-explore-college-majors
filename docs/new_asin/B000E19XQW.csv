8103760,4,B000E19XQW,"Likely the best looking prints of these two ESK films you'll find,
almost no splices or edits or missing frames.

However, there's 1 minute and 29 seconds of footage missing from the original
cut of ""That Gang of Mine"".  I've only seen & acquired that missing footage from a Timeless Video
Classics VHS release of ""TGoM"" (SP mode).

Very good audio & video bit-rate for a budget DVD!

Cardboard packaging, though - no plastic clam shell case.

Note to new purchasers: DVD is held inside cardboard packaging by a jelled substance.
Likely to have reduced manufacturing costs. So have a jewel case handy when opening.

Nice Drive-In Movie setting at the Main Menu.

A 3 Stooges cartoon included as an Intermission. Strictly for fans of the Stooges, though.",1388534400,,753,4.8359375
