8639456,5,B00I5SM2LY,"This v&iacute;deo is incredible.  I'v never been to Quebec, but the sights are so Beautiful.  I use this video while I do stationary walk.  I love the idea of walking at home while you ""travel"" virtually.  I try to follow the pace of the video, which is about 4 miles, or 10,000 feet in one hour.  And time flies doing excersise this way.  I plan to buy other videos by Vita.",1450137600,,375,4.211267605633803
8639457,5,B00I5SM2LY,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD! It's crisp. It's sharp. It's shot on a beautiful day in a gorgeous city! Truly ""like being there!"" You'll love watching this while walking on the treadmill or riding on your exercise bike. But it's so beautiful and relaxing, you'll think it's great just to have on while your attending to chores or busy work around the house. And, for anyone traveling to Quebec City anytime soon, I think watching this would be a fun way to explore the sites and get a feel for the city you're about to visit. Highly recommended. Five stars all the way!",1436400000,,566,4.504854368932039
