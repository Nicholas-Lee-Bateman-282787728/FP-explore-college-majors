Thank You from Hank Saucedo",1174262400,2,228,4.3023255813953485
2567631,5,B000FII21G,1 had not seen the 1981 NINER cowboy game since that day when we sat in the corner where Clark made the catch. That alone makes this a must have and the rest is outstanding!,1173139200,,173,3.9714285714285715
2567632,5,B000FII21G,Great dvd...my brother really liked it...Joe Montana was a favorite of his from the heyday of the 49ers in the eighties...great buy,1169424000,,131,5.0
2567633,4,B000FII21G,"Where is the special content about Jerry Rice?

And the other Greits? Where are they?

But I must admit the 49ers would deserve at least a 4 DVDs package to make justice of their history!",1168473600,5,187,4.314285714285714
2567634,3,B000FII21G,"As a life-long Niner fan who went to his first game 1975, I had high hopes for the DVD set but unfortunately my worst fears came true. Nearly 95% of the DVD dealt with the 1980's and 90s and very little before then.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Glory Years of the 80'2 and 90's (I went to so many of those great games). Still, something must be said about the players prior to the 1980s who played so hard during the tough times.

BEST PARTS - Bill Walsh's coaching clinic on passing. Having Bill Walsh teach you about passing is like Mozart teaching you how to write an opera. Great, insightful stuff!

Another must-see if the 50-minute documentary on Michael Zagaris whose journey took him from taking pictures at Kezar Stadium, working for RKF in '68, hanging out with rock stars to being the 49ers' offical team photograher.

WORST PART - They actually have a seperate segment on T.O. and not one on far more worthy subjects like John Brodie, Gene Washington, Cedrick Hardman, Tommy Hart, Paul Hoffer, Bill Ring nor JNimmy Johnson and Dave Wilcox, both memebers of the Hall of Fame. I would rather see classic clips from those who paved the way and paid the price than B.O., I mean, T.O.

In short, it is a history of the 49ers, just no thte complete history.",1155686400,72,1266,4.463203463203463

2567669,2,B000FII21G,The packaging was open and there are dents in the cover and the box itself doesn't close completely. It's kind of trashed looking. I'm disappointed that it looks so bad since it's a Christmas gift.,1418256000,,197,4.6571428571428575

2567676,5,B000FII21G,The order arrived on time and was as describe by the seller.  In my whole I always a 49 ers fan.  In this dvd I get to know the history of the 49ers and the favorite players of the 49 ers like Joe Montana Jerry Rice Clark and Steve Young.  How they became the power team in the 1980 and early 1990 and won totals five championships.,1381104000,,332,3.925373134328358
2567677,3,B000FII21G,"Unfortunately, the 49er history started in 1949! The rich history of the 50's with Frankie Albert, YA Title, Joe Arenas, Billy Wilson, Dickie Moegle, Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny, Johnny Henry Johnson, Matt Hazeltine, John Brodie, Gene Washington, Dave Parks, Red Hickey, Dave Baker, Eddie Dove, Jimmy Johnson, JD Smith, Abe Woodson, tommy Hart, Ced Hardman and others before the SuperBowls were barely mentioned or excluded. The more accurate title should be: The San Francisco 49ers: The Incomplete history. And as a Big time faithful, I am very disappointed by lack and or missing 49ers that build the early history of our 49ers tradition! Since I am very interested, I hope this issue is addressed!",1378857600,,699,5.140350877192983
2567678,5,B000FII21G,I would say if you are a 49ers fan then u need this in your collection it is awesome and go 9ers,1374883200,,96,3.409090909090909
2567679,1,B000FII21G,This Film spent more time praising the Dallas Cowboys then presenting the 49ers. There should have been more details about the the great players over time and coaches for the 49ers and less story line on Dallas. If I had wanted to see a film praising Dallas I would have bought a dvd on Dallas.,1371168000,3,294,4.363636363636363
2567680,5,B000FII21G,Great DVD for any niner fan.  It is a must have for your collection.  I have personally enjoyed the content of this product.,1364428800,,124,4.3478260869565215

2567694,5,B000FII21G,"I thought this was a very cool DVD. I've been a huge 49ers fan and it's great to see some of the history of how it all got started. It even shows the 1981 NFC Championship game between the 49ers and the Cowboys (almost in it's entirety). I thought it had great coverage of the 1940's roughly all the way to the early 2000's, with the highlight being the 49ers golden years (1980's). Excellent DVD.",1328659200,5,397,4.306666666666667
2567695,5,B000FII21G,I am a big 49ers fan so I was very happy when I got it. The reason it choose this product was the price. Price is a big thing when I do my online shopping. Amazon always come out and wins. Because u dude have stuff that u can out find anywhere else.,1328572800,,249,3.7169811320754715
2567696,5,B000FII21G,"Great DVD pack, I got it for a very low price of only 9.99 so why wouldn't I buy it? Go 49ers!",1310083200,,94,3.3181818181818183
2567697,5,B000FII21G,"Everything you ever wanted to know about Californias most successfull team by the bay.  From Walsh to Rice.  From Joe Montana to the original stadium before the ""golden days"" in candlestick.  If your a fan you already own this.  If your a true fan you have every game recorded already.",1304553600,,285,4.64
2567698,5,B000FII21G,"This is a great product that does an excellent job at telling the history of the 49ers and not just the Heyday of the Montana years, but the history from the beginning, through the Brodie years and finally into the Montana Era. The best feature of this product is the 1981 NFC Championship Game between the 49ers and the Cowboys. That marked the rise of the Montana Era and the decline of the Cowboy dominance. I especially liked the player's commentary during the game. This one game was the reason why I bought this product, and I was not disappointed.",1264550400,5,554,4.55
2567699,3,B000FII21G,"How can you have a ""Complete History"" of the Forty Niners with special sections on Terrell Owens and Jeff Garcia and then leave out Hall-of-Famers Jerry Rice and Steve Young? Pretty funny when you think about it--except that it really happened.",1261612800,25,244,4.975609756097561
2567700,2,B000FII21G,"I enjoyed the dvd overall. However, I was not at all pleased to see the outer cover bent from having it slipped into a shipping cover box. It defeats the whole purpose in trying to keep it as a collector's item due to the poor handling of my dvd case.",1256083200,,251,4.04
2567701,5,B000FII21G,This was a gift and the receipient loves it. It was delivered really quick and without any damages to the package.,1231200000,,114,4.476190476190476
2567702,1,B000FII21G,Bought the dvd for the 1981 game due to the recent death of Bill Walsh. The play by play of Pat Summeral and Buck comes to you from an underwater mike. Pat and Mr. Buck are distant voices played over a game view from end zone cameras. This an inferior telecast compared to the original TV telecast.,1186444800,5,298,4.245614035087719
2567703,5,B000FII21G,"Growing up here in So Cal, I was a huge L.A. Rams fan during the 80's, so I knew first hand how great Montana was.  He always took out my team.  After watching the bit on Quarterbacking, by Bill Walsh, I realize now why they were so good, and we, along with the rest of the league, were not.  Everything, from the foot work, to the placement of the ball so the reciever could catch it in stride.  I would recomend any high school QB to watch this, there is so much to learn.  As for the rest, they include the NFL Game of the Week for Super Bowl 16.  Not the John Facenda Super Bowl highlight, but the 23 minute one with Harry Kalas.  That, along with the 'The Catch' makes this DVD a must have.

Quarterbacking by Bill Walsh: Lessons from the Master",1177113600,9,750,4.124137931034483
