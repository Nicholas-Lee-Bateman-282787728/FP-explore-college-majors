8058445,5,B00097E6PE,"Great movie for teens--I purchased it for my grandson, and I enjoyed it!  This movie addressed the question:  are we truly willing to live for Christ and to die to self?",1432080000,,169,4.419354838709677
8058446,4,B00097E6PE,"This could use a remake, but its useful as a discussion starter. His escape was way too easy. The story is a little slow in parts and didn't hold the attention of the teens, but they commented that they too experienced restrictions in public school i.e not being allowed to bring a Bible to school.",1405987200,,298,4.4363636363636365
8058447,3,B00097E6PE,"As Im interested in many things Russian, this is strictly eye candy during the days before the Russian Federation of today.  The main actor tries to perform in a very low budget, amateur production with religious overtones.",1389225600,,223,5.027027027027027
8058448,5,B00097E6PE,Great movie with a good lesson!  Everyone ought to see it to realize just how quickly we can get sucked into things we know isn't right.,1377907200,,136,4.230769230769231
8058449,5,B00097E6PE,"I  liked this movie and i watched it more than one time and enjoyed it everytime. this film showed how the Lord can pretect his own and provide for his own. it proves that the enemy even though he wants to, cannot harm Gods people unless he allows it. this film was wonderful because it included the conversion of a family, a stedfast teen christian who didn't take down even though he was pressured, and the victory of a community. i would rate this a ten at any time. Bravo for the conversion factors in this film. Worth it!",1296864000,,526,4.313131313131313
8058450,4,B00097E6PE,"I thought this movie was pretty good. A boy living in a country with severe religious persecution, and he flees to america, hoping for freedom...To a degree, he finds it, but also realizes that not everyone is real for Jesus like he wants to be! It's a great Christ Centered movie, though very low budget! I'm glad it's now part of my collection...Ed Dennis (MrEd)",1272844800,,364,4.615384615384615
8058451,3,B00097E6PE,"This film explores the experiences of a Russian high school student who escapes from Russia, prior to the fall of communism.  His parents were arrested, and he was sent to a youth detention center, all because they were practicing Christians, belonging to an underground church.  Our hero expects to find religious freedom and fervor in America.  However, when he's placed with a stereotypical American church-going family, he finds doubt amongst the young, weak spirituality amongst the adults, and ultimately, that the lure of America's material good life is tempting indeed.

The film is a strong choice for churches looking for a discussable movie to show--especially for youth groups.  The themes will engage Christian audiences, provoking conversation on many Christian living issues.

On the other hand, this is not really an evangelistic film.  Non-Christians will be bored by the content (which is extremely dated), amused by the amatuerish quality of the production, and they may feel preached at, though not very effectively so.

PROS:  Interested topics that transcend time--issues of family, spiritual fervor, and the lure of material wealth and popularity.

CONS:  This movie is extremely dated.  It has to represent the late 1970s or early 1980s, and has the feel of a movie made soon thereafter, not 2000 as claimed.  Quality--the production and acting level here is quite amatuerish.  There is heart here, but not compelling acting.

Bottom-line:  An acceptable choice for religious conversation groups, or Christian family viewing, but not much appeal to the broader society.",1134604800,6,1593,5.388663967611336
