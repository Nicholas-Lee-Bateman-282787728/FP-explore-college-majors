3467419,5,B001AV3BY0,"If you are looking for drama that will entertain, educate and amaze you with its brilliant acting and writing, you would do well to buy House: Seasons 1 - 4 Collection.

Dr. House is the Sherlock Holmes of medical drama. Every episode will draw you into the medical mystery to be solved. The writing is so tight that this show requires your full attention, or you'll miss a significant aspect to the intricate story.

Without a doubt, Hugh Laurie is absolute perfection as Dr. House! No other actor could portray this character as well. This four season collection is an investment that will entertain you for years to come!",1223683200,2,624,4.715596330275229
3467420,5,B001AV3BY0,"When I ordered the box set, I never expected trying to watch every episode would take so long...I still haven't finished season 2. I love that there are 4 hour long episodes on each disk...and 5-6 disks per season...at least so far. The show is addicting I love it.",1222646400,,265,4.428571428571429
3467421,5,B001AV3BY0,I love this collection because it allowed me to watch episodes that I forgot about and loved to watch again. Dr. House is the kind of doctor I would like to see. Hugh Laurie plays hims with such ease that I almost thin there really is a Gregory House. His supporting cast is fabulous. I especially like the gal who plays Dr. Cutty. She is something else. I recommend this to any House fan.,1222473600,2,389,4.27027027027027

3467423,5,B001AV3BY0,House is one of my favourite characters. The box set contains all 4 seasons (the 4th season is my least favourite). Nothing much else to say.,1221782400,,141,4.461538461538462
3467424,5,B001AV3BY0,"I am a long-time very devoted fan of Hugh Laurie, so naturally, I watch House religiously. I already had seasons 1-3 on DVD, but when it was confirmed that this set contained season one on single sided discs, I had to buy it! I needed season 4 anyway, so it was well worth the money, and I gave my old season 1-3 sets to a friend who was very happy to get free dvds. House is without a doubt the best show that television has to offer these days, and while the whole cast is great, Hugh is the reason I watch; I'm not sure any other actor could make the show as wonderful as it is. If you're at all frustrated with the double sided discs of season 1, or just love the show anyway, don't hesitate. Buy this set, sit back and enjoy!",1221436800,14,730,4.041379310344827
3467425,5,B001AV3BY0,"Never followed the series on TV in seasons 1 thru 4 picked up the box set after watching a marathon. I tried to get an idea of what I was getting by reading the reviews of the single season 1 disc sets. Each disc is single sided in the 1 to 4 disc set and is true widescreen. That concerned me the most.

The character chemistry is excellent on this series. Hugh Laurie added allot of personal touches to House's character, the cane twirling and stomping are two of his ideas he added to this character. I am a little concerned over the changing of some of the characters in season 4 haven gotten there yet, the characters are still on the show but in different capacities. As long as you can watch this series as a TV drama you will enjoy it. If you are looking for a true medical show this may not be a good buy for you, while close to true medical cases some things are added to enhance the show. The exterior shots of the hospital are actually the student center at Princeton University here in NJ.",1221264000,,1002,4.21875

For a price like this for a product like this is simply insane because I would have paid a buck fifty for the collection seperately, but I only paid 100. This product is great for people who want to enjoy Hugh Laurie at his finest, on a daily basis or whenever you choose, because, hey, you got four seasons of it and this is what every House fanatic needs. So, all-in-all this product was a great product at a good respectable price.",1250553600,,573,4.26605504587156
3467463,3,B001AV3BY0,"The show itself I'd give 5 stars; however, watch the price. $114 is too much for this, especially in regular DVD format (would understand this price fore Blu-ray). I bought all 4 seasons for $20 per (two 2-packs for $40 each at Target), and I've seen pre-order packages of seasons 1-5 go for as low as $89 (roughly $18 a season), so I def. wouldn't pay the nearly $30 a season this is currently sitting at. In conclusion, great show, but do some price hunting.",1249948800,,460,4.423529411764706

The only other problem I had was that season 1 has no bonus material, the words come up on every disc but you can't select it. Other than that this is a must have for House fans.

3467489,5,B001AV3BY0,I am so impressed with this series.  It was well worth the money and we can't wait to get the next season and the future seasons.  The best part is watching with no commercials.  The plot can be followed so much better.,1241136000,,219,4.166666666666667

I just discovered House in season 4, so starting at the beginning is an education. I am amazed the show survived past the pilot.  Scenes are shown in a stylized high orange glow with a focus on blood and guts and idiotically simplistic conversations between supposed medical doctors.  Cuddy suffers from a lack of personality while House exhibits uncertainty and doubt; obviously not the cocky cynical a** (with hidden vulnerability, and those eyes!) who we all love. Luckily, by the second episode the irritating quirks of the pilot can be forgiven and fogotten. If you love House like I do, get this set. It is wonderful, and I can hardly wait to check out the bonus features!",1240099200,,812,4.912408759124087

I got these DVDs as a Christmas present for my boyfriend, and he called me one day to tell me that one of the disks main menu was in chinese, and the episodes were recorded directly for the television.  I went over to his apartment to see for sure, and he was absolutely right!  All of the other disks work fine, there is just one that there is a problem with.  The episodes on the disk say ""Fox 5"" or something in the lower right hand corner, and has the television rating in the upper left corner.  The picture is a little distorted, but nothing we can't live with.

3467525,5,B001AV3BY0,"House is an extremely well-done show:  Hugh Laurie's character is the centerpiece, but the interesting balance of supporting cast really brings out the chemistry.  Critics complain that each episode is predictable, but that's not the point.  An episode of House isn't about the ""patient of the week""--it's a Sherlock Holmes story, where how the mystery is solved is far more interesting than the fact *that* it is solved.

If you're in the medical profession, a lot of this may seem unbelievable.  Just remind yourself that the secondary enjoyment of this show is the vicarious thrill of watching House say things every doctor wishes they could say, or do things to a patient for which any normal doctor would be fired, or even arrested.

The House Seasons 1-4 collection is just that:  a bundled package of all four boxed sets of House on DVD.  There are no bonus bundle goodies, but you get a much better deal on the set than if you'd bought each season singly.  That's not to say there's no bonus material here:  in each season you'll find extras aplenty, from deleted scenes to behind-the-scenes to bloopers, outtakes, and goofing around (Season One, for example, has scenes that for some odd reason were shot in Valley-Girl-speak).  The menus provide easy access to all episodes, an episode index, of the bonus materials, and in a nod to convenience, each disc will tell you which disc in the series contains which bonus materials:  no repeat swapping to find the bits you want to see.

If you're interested in House, I highly recommend you go ahead and buy the set:  these seasons don't disappoint, and you'll end up getting more for your money.",1233014400,3,1651,4.808510638297872

Its manages to be funny and an engaging drama at the same time. Its really a medical version of CSI and both shows have a Sherlock Holmes type feel to them.
The characters are excellant, and their are many great storylines and episodes. House changed it up in the fourth season by bringing in new charachters and delegating others to more minor parts, which upset many fans. The show has stayed strong despite this though the jury is still out on whether this was a mistake.
This collection features the first four individual seasons and the packaging is decent, but there are no extras.",1232150400,,752,4.536764705882353

I was expecting the individual boxes for each season as seen in stores and on the site. Even the e-mail they sent me to review my purchase had the picture of each season in the seperate boxes.

3467571,4,B001AV3BY0,"House is an interesting study in despicable human character.  Dr. House is abrasive, deceitful, drug-addicted, and willing to experiment on patients like some World War II Nazi.  He is also the sum of his experiences, and we can observe glimpses of what made him into who he is, why he tries to heal, why he is willing to lie, cheat and steal to get his job done, the damage that he does to his relationships and the impact that is has on him.

I don't watch this for the formulaic problem solving -- it is CSI in a hospital, finding the culprit disease after some reverses.  I watch this for the character interactions (and morbidly watching to see what trouble House stirs up next, OK ...).

Dr. Cutty (House's boss) could be a stronger character.  She seems to be just a foil for House's antics, and not so much an intelligent doctor in her own right.",1229040000,,854,4.4423076923076925

Imagine my suprise when the item arrived at my friend's front door with an invoice in the box. In addition, the disc pakaging looked a bit suspect. When it comes to actually watching the series, the first season was not bad, but seasons 2-4 look like a bootleg copy. The video is not crisp, a channel 5 logo appears on screen clearly showing that this was recorded off someone's television, and some episodes are in japanese- complete with menu. I may have been born at night, but it wasn't last night. I am extremely unsatisfied. If a product is advertised as new, it should be new. Not having watched the season bootlegged off mom's basement television doesn't make it new, and in no way is worth the price. I felt like an idiot having given this to a good friend for his birthday.
