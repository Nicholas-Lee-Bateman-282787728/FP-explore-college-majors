866110,5,6304396031,"I bought this video (and Firm Cardio) from reading reviews on Amazon, and let me tell you, the rave reviews were right!  This is a great workout, a good mix of a lot of weight lifting, some aerobics, and floor work.  The  two areas this video works on a lot are triceps and inner thighs, both  areas that I think a lot of us would like to work on.  The instructor is  not too perky and does explain a lot of the moves well.  I like this one  better than Firm Cardio, but the two of them together do provide effect  workouts.  Having done each of them 3-5 times, I already do notice the  difference in appearance of my thighs, arms, and butt, and also feel like  my flexibility has increased.  These tapes are a great buy because you can  increase the intensity by using heavier weights and ankle weights.",956793600,18,804,4.273333333333333
866111,5,6304396031,"I have what seems to be a full library of Firm tapes and this one is one of the best.  It is fun and challenging and provides results for a strong and shapely upper body without the bulky look.  If you haven't tried the  Firm yet, you are wasting your time with other videos and even the gym.  If  you are new to exercise, do not be discouraged, try these tapes without  weights until you master the moves.  You will not be sorry you did.",956275200,8,438,4.08235294117647
866240,1,6304396031,"This is more of a glamour routing than anything else.  Too busy -Greek/Roman statuettes in the background various sizes, huge fireplace, boring routine, and the participants' are so phoney.  The instructor and the participants routine are more erotic than anything else.  I couldn't bare doing the entire video.  Oh and the music, too loud and didn't sync with the moves.  This video had potential, if it wasn't for all that.

Now I know why I had it hidden for so many years behind my other exercise videos.",1186617600,,508,4.781609195402299
866241,5,6304396031,"I thought this was a really outragous workout. Pam is a really great Firm instructer. This tape focuses a lot on weight training,I do not think it is really that good for beginners because Pam moves very quikly.

  If you are a beginner though you will get used to it,just use lighter weights. You will need several sets of dumbells,the firm fannylifter and male sure you have a barbell. Pam uses the barbell in many different ways on this tape.

  You will also need a set of ankle weight when Pam does the floor work,I swear my legs were almost to cry out with mercy after the floor work. Not just my legs,but my abs as well. The abnominal portion of this video is very killer. I guarantee you will love this one. Pam is amazing.",1152057600,,731,4.338235294117647
866242,5,6304396031,"This is definitely one of the best Firms ever made,hands down. The instructor,Ms Cauthen, has a body to die for and yet the sequencing just tricks you into working hard. It is mostly weights,not cardio,which is good because weights are more effective than cardio long term. It does move along quickly so have your stuff out. You can use a high step stool for the leg press. The abs section is brief but you can work those tommorrow. There are no ""silly"" moves in this tape,no wasted time and the instructor is very pleasant,not annoying like some. One of the top 5 I own and I have over 100 videos. You may also like a newer release by this instructor-Supercharged sculpting,which is shorter and has no cardio but still gives you a good workout.",1120694400,3,745,4.567164179104478
866243,5,6304396031,"This workout is one of my favorite Firms, why did I wait so long to buy it. I really like the sequence of the workout, it alternates between upper and lower body focusing on one upper body muscle group at a time until it is fatigued then you do a lower body exercise. You will see all the traditional exercises, lunges, dips, leg presses, squats, inner thigh floorwork for the lower body. Some of the lower body sets are short so you can really heavy up on the weights if you choose. Upper body is thorough as well, bicep curls, one arm and double arm lat rows, tricep kickbacks, french presses, lying tricep extensions, pushups, upright rows, military presses, front and side deltoid raises, the sets for triceps and shoulders are particulary killer. There is one interesting back exercise called a T-Bar rows where you use a barbell loaded heavy at one end, using a towel at the opposite end and you pull the barbell up using the towel. Of course if you do not have a barbell, you can use dumbells easily in place of it. There are some short cardio segments in this workout, 2 of them use lighter dumbells. Plus there is some challenging ab work towards the end. You will need a tall box or step stool, plus assorted dumbells, ankle weights are used in a few segments but you can do the exercises without them.

Pam Cauthen leads this video, she is very toned and in great shape. I didn't really like her outfit but that's just a minor thing in an otherwise terrific workout. The library setting didn't bother me a bit, and I thought the music was nice, more of a jazzy soundtrack. If you like the Firm definitely add this one to your collection.",1110067200,7,1648,4.456953642384106
866244,3,6304396031,"Okay, so basically the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I thought the instructor, Pam, moved between exercises very quickly. And really this was only a problem for me, I think, because this is the first ""older"" firm tape I have used and I'm not quite used to the flow yet.

Overall though this is a really good workout. I have used older videos (ingeneral, not FIRM) where the exercises are un-safe and dated, but the ones in FRIM Strength are the exception. I have been a dancer all my life and ""thought"" that my legs were very strong. But this workout had them burning (in a good way) like nothing before! If you try this tape, I can almost gurantee it will become a favorite!",1106524800,3,698,4.369230769230769
866245,5,6304396031,"After seeing the commercial for the new Firm workout for the hundreth time, I decided to pull out some of my older Firm tapes. This Cross-Trainers tape is incredible.  I made it through the workout, but was sweating buckets by the end. I had forgotten what a great all-over workout this was.  The ab section is especially effective.  The instructor is great - wonderful cues.  All this reminded me that I still like the older Firm tapes the best. They're just good ole straight-forward workouts without all the fancy choreography that you see in the newer workouts. The Firm tapes are still where you want to go if you're working out at home, but check out the older tapes for simple, but intense, routines.",1091491200,4,707,4.67741935483871
866246,5,6304396031,"All I can say is wow - this workout really lives up to the standards I have developed for Firm workouts.  Like other Firm workouts, the exercises are straight-forward and require relatively low coordination (which is good for someone like me who loves to work out but can never seem to follow an aerobic tape because of confusing choreography).  However, the instructor does move from one workout sequence to the next rather quickly so you need to have your step and weights nearby - but after viewing the workout a few times and becoming familiar with the routine following her instructions should be no problem.  This workout is intense both on the upper and lower body and utilizes many of the same moves as other Firm workouts such as squats with weights, leg presses off the step, and the same general arm exercises with the addition of a few barbell exercises.  Overall, as an intermediate to advanced exerciser I found this workout to be challenging and interesting enough to keep in my normal rotation.  My one major complaint is that the instructor seems a little bland - some people may prefer the fact that she is not perky - but when I am working my butt off I prefer someone a bit more upbeat.",1085702400,3,1206,4.616822429906542
866247,5,6304396031,"I have been doing Firm videos since last year (had to take a break for 6 moths for illness) and This one is my favorite.  It is lead by Pam and alternates between upper and lower body and strength training and cardio.  Easy to learn the moves but a tough and effective workout.
However, it is not for everyone.  If u don't like hard and fast work or don't want to invest in a set of weights (at least 3, 5, & 8lbs) than this is not the video for u.  It takes real work but if u commit to it (& add firm cardio to alternate with) the results will be fast and amazing.",1083888000,6,566,3.8956521739130436
866248,5,6304396031,"I keep this tape in my current rotations because it's good.  You get an upper and lower body workout that's complete.  You feel you have worked everything as much as you should and that's the most important thing to me.  As with all FIRM tapes the pace is quick so have all your equipment ready and easy to reach.  When I first got the tape I was smart enough to review it first and I recommend that so you can mentally be prepared for what is going to happen.  I guarantee if you are not familiar with the FIRM style and you don't preview the tape you will quit before it's done.
The tape box I got has a wonderful section on the back that details every piece of equipment you will need as well as a break down of the time spent on each segment.  The tape is about an hour including the warm up and cool down.
It's definitely got a dated look but it still works.  That's one of the good things about these older FIRM tapes in that they don't have gimmicky exercises... they stick to the tried and true.  You will do lunges, bicep curls, squats etc.  All very effective.  A special note about the equipment.  Included in this tape is the step up exercise for your buns/upper thigh area.  When I first started out I didn't have the ""official"" step from the the FIRM which is 14 inches high.  I used a step I got from a local linen store that's used to step onto high bedframes.  It was 12 inches high and in the beginning I didn't use any weights.  Now I have moved up to using the 14 inch step with 10 lbs weights it hasn't been quite a year so you can progress.  If you have an aerobic bench step you can use that as well.  Don't let not having the official step get in the way.  The point is to lift your foot up so many inches off the ground and you should approach this experimenting with your own level.
This will produce results if you do the exercises as shown.  Goof off, do some but not others and you won't see any results.",1061683200,8,1933,4.120320855614973
866249,4,6304396031,"Although this video and its companion, Firm Cardio, both bill themselves as including cardio and weights, they are both very heavy on weights, with a tiny bit of cardio mixed in.  It is not a true ""circuit training"" type video where you do roughly equal amounts of strength and cardio training.  Also, Firm Strength and Firm Cardio are both very heavy on legs (lunges, dips, leg press).  They do some upper body also, but it seems like every few minutes the instructor is saying, ""Prepare for lunges...""
Anyway, this is a good strength training video for interemediate to advanced exercisers.",1060300800,5,592,4.9
866343,5,6304396031,"Done alone, or teamed with ""Firm Cardio"", this is a fine Firm workout. This tape focuses a little more on the upper body, especially the triceps, but still includes great lower body segments.  I never felt I had much upper body strength until I had been doing this workout and ""Firm Cardio"" for about two weeks.  I saw more muscle definition in that time, but felt the results even sooner.  It is a tough workout so I really feel a great sense of accomplishment after I finish it each time.  It is good for those days when you really feel like ""pumping it up.""",1059350400,4,560,4.355769230769231
866344,5,6304396031,"I have been a loyal user of the Firm videos for over a year now.  They are definitely not for the feint of heart because they are a challenging workout that doesn't get boring.
This viseo is no exception.  It uses the same weight/aerobic mix as the other Firm videos, but this one is one of my all-time faves because of the instructor.  Pam Cauthen is probably the best instructor ever at the firm.  I like how calm she is and her voice never grates on my nerves.  She cues well and, I don't know about anyone else, but I want to finish the workout everytime because she makes me think I can!
I know this sounds cheesy, but this really is a great video and I encourage anyone else to give it an honest try.  The FIRM isn't like every other video on the market...they really work...I have personally experienced how quickly the results start to show and I know how rewarding it is to stick with it.  Some of the other reviewers seemed disappointed that the instructor wasn't a bubble-gum cheerleader princess (no offence Denise Austin), but for me, that is the appeal.  When I work out...I'm there to work out and I don't need to waste my money on a video where the instructor will annoy me forever after the second time I do the video...
Take my advice and pick this one up!  You won't regret it",1055894400,8,1295,4.340248962655601
866345,5,6304396031,"I have been a ""firm believer"" for about ten years now.  This video has been one of my favorites.  My VCR ate it and I now have to order a new one.  I don't hesitate to buy it again.  I am able to stay a size 8 at the age of 49 and have strength and flexibility of many women half my age as a result of working out with the videos produced by the Firm.  If there is one negative to this and any other firm video, it would be the ""stepford wife"" personna of the instructors.  If you can get past that and the grandiose sets they use and just concentrate on the workout, the promise of ""visible results within 10 workouts"" will come to fruition.  I promise",1027555200,12,653,3.976923076923077
866346,5,6304396031,"I love The Firm workout series, but this one is my favorite for five years now. The atmosphere, while a bit dark, is still upbeat, the instructor is cheerful but never too peppy or annoying and the class is great...a nice mix of body types all in good physical shape. Oh yeah, and the workout works.
The mix of aerobic and tonig exercises makes this tape difficult, but the time goes by quickly. The routine ensures that every part of the body is taxed and I ALWAYS have sore inner thighs the day after completing this workout. This tape is definately not for beginners, but the steps are easy and the intensity of the workout largely depends on how heavy of weights are used, making this a tape that suits the needs of nearly everone. Definately a must have for the home exerciser.",1024358400,10,782,4.475524475524476

866348,4,6304396031,"I own most of The Firm tapes and believe they are the best videos on the market.  Although this video is longish-roughly an hour, it has alot of great arm sculpting exercises, A LOT of lunges and a killer ab workout, which is great.  The aerobics segments are ok, they aren't too exerting however in the end they get a bit confusing...Altogether if you have the time to spare and want a complete body workout this is a good one...After doing it a couple times the time seemed to pass quickly.

I like this instructor a lot, though she cues incorrectly a few times, but is generally very accurate.  My first  Firm tape was Low Impact Aerobics and although that is also a tough and  effective workout, the cueing is awful and I almost gave up on the Firm.

You do need a bit of equipment to do  the video - but I found it was easy to substitute stuff like a chair or  step-stool rather than go out and but the equipment.,960940800,3,348,3.887323943661972
866352,5,6304396031,"Firm Strength (formerly called Strongbody) is an excellent workout approx. 1 hour long. Firm Strength is one of the Firm's crosstrainer tapes. It was designed to be alternated with another tape Firm Cardio (formerly called  Strongheart)to maximize results. The workout is at an intermediate level.  Led by Pam Cauthen, the workout starts with a warmup/stretch and includes  10min. of aerobics, 32 minutes of bodybuilding, 8 min of abs/thigh work and  a short final stretch. The Firm usually  uses lavish sets in their videos.  This setting is a beautiful library, darker than some of the other sets but  lovely. Pam gives good cueing and has just the right amount of enthusiasm!  Equipment needed includes a tall step up box for leg work, aerobic step,  dumbbells.

7870394,5,6304396031,"This is a tough, tough work out (any body who says otherwise is lying).  You need various size dumbbells, a bar bell (although can do the same moves with dumbbells), and a step (the 'tall box' used in the DVD is no longer manufactured; sturdy stool or step, which is actually better since you can adjust the height, will do). Used in conjunction with the companion Firm Cardio work out, you will feel and see results fast. The 56 minute work out is on par with the Firm's original six volume tapes.  It is mainly weights with a few minutes of aerobic moves mixed in.  Some here have commented that the there is a lot of emphases on the triceps moves.  Not true!  It may be more memorable, but the moves are no longer than any other body part.  The instructor is amiable enough, although there are some minor slip ups in her queuing, once you learn the moves this should not be a big problem.  I like the music (light jazz), it doesn't distract from trying to learn the moves.  Like all the Firm work outs, there are a lot of moves to keep on your toes so you don't just go through the motions. I'm always thinking about the next move. The one caveat is that it is definitely not for beginners.  Even without using weights, it is still a tough work out.
