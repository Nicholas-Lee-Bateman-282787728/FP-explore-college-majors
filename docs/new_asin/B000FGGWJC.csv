I like to put it on the TV when I have folks over for dinner or drinks.

The only problem is that it seems ~a little~ blurry and distorted on my 32"" TV.",1480377600,,204,3.6136363636363638
8122302,5,B000FGGWJC,"I am a DJ and this is excellent for projecting on the walls behind people dancing. I've also used this for parties.

This is 100% eye candy - gorgeous excellent eye candy. This is not a boring documentary but animated black and white op art. You can choose the speed and style as well and then just set it loose for the night.

If you're hosting a stylish party or have a club night - this dvd is perfect for you.

(Also- paying so much is a shame - I understand it's out of print but it's available for rent on Netflix)

Enjoy!",1427500800,,528,4.097087378640777
8122303,5,B000FGGWJC,My students were mezmorized by the moving OP ART images in this DVD. We kept it going all day. I use it as silent moving background during class in my alternative high school art room. I'm like more like this one...and the price was better than the cost of the same DVD in my school art catalog.,1243641600,,295,4.192982456140351

8122305,1,B000FGGWJC,I was disappointed with this video. It was merely a powerpoint slide show with each illusion morphing.,1209254400,6,102,5.0588235294117645
