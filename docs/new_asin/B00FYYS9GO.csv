8619634,5,B00FYYS9GO,"Typically great Vinegar Syndrome release.  The movies are not paired as a Russ Meyer double feature, but by producer Albert Zugsmith.  Fanny Hill is Russ Meyer's first attempt at a ""Mainstream"" movie with more innuendo (and clothing) than in his self produced features.  The Phantom Stranger is an incredibly bizarre Western Comedy that I had never heard of, and would probably have not sought out, but is so weird that I had a good time with it.  Highly recommended for those with appropriately strange tastes.",1457740800,2,511,4.976470588235294
8619635,3,B00FYYS9GO,"For those who remember Russ Meyer as the king of big bouncing bare boobs, Fanny Hill is not it!  Filmed in B&W before he discovered that people like nudity, this is a decent telling of Cleland's story.
The acting is adequate, the sets decent, the writing more a comedy than Cleland's novel.  This version has a g-rating, zero nudity or profanity and focuses on the comedic aspect of Fanny's coming of age.

So if you want a g-rated comedy, this is a decent film.
if you want erotica or nudity, move on.",1431648000,4,502,4.434782608695652
