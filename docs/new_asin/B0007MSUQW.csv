2220118,5,B0007MSUQW,"My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves the Wiggles and wants to watch them all the time, but I feel their regular videos are too long at 50 to 70 minutes since I am trying to limit her TV time to 2 hrs a day. I love this DVD since it has four SHORT episodes on it so I can select one and have her get her Wiggle fix in only 15 to 20 minutes. I wish they would make a ""Lights, Camera, Action!"" Volume 2 DVD so I could get some more of these little gems.",1231632000,,444,3.5876288659793816

8048977,2,B0007MSUQW,"All of the Wiggles movies have the same songs in them, this video especially. Not only are all of the songs repeated in every movie but all of the songs use the same little music video that goes with the song. They basically reorder the playlist and sell it as a different dvd. Granted some of them have different story lines but they still use the same songs and music videos. I wish I would have known this before I bought most of the movies. Save your money and only buy a couple of them or else you will basically be buying the same videos.",1502150400,,544,4.190476190476191

8048981,3,B0007MSUQW,"The mythology of the man swirls thick and fast around Murray Wiggles, an author whose lasting influence on the literary zeitgeist remains impermeably splashed like spilled dregs of Carlo Rossi. Apocryphal legends abound regarding Murray the drinker, Murray the womanizer, Murray the belligerent, Murray Wiggles the unexpectedly tender-hearted. What is perhaps most striking about these legends is that, among the many titles bestowed upon them with over 40 published DVDs to The Wiggles' name, that of working stiffs is rarely invoked. Its undeniably more glamorous to imagine our heroes drowning in whiskey and women than parked for eight hours a day in front of a studio director, but it is precisely that unglamorous discipline from which The Wiggles are born, and precisely that unglamorous discipline, plus the attendant drinking, womanizing, belligerence, and tenderness, that gave rise to The Wiggles' Lights Camera Action...",1425168000,,932,5.570422535211268

8048984,3,B0007MSUQW,"I loved the ORIGINAL Wiggles when my kids were younger. I wanted to buy a DVD with the original cast in it for my niece. And I bought this one thinking $38 was a little pricey, but considered it about $10 an episode. (there are 4 episodes)... when my sister got the packed she texted me a picture of the DVD case... on the front was a huge red tag marked $5!!! Argh! Frustrating... I'm sure the seller went a bought a ton of these and marked it up to make some mooolah. I get it. You have to make money. But it was a little disappointing. But, my niece is enjoying it as I knew she would. What do you do??",1393459200,2,605,3.9672131147540983
