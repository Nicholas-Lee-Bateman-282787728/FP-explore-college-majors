2595277,5,B000FZETV6,"This is one of my best buys of the year by far.  Marie Forleo who led Crunch Cardio Dance Blast leads you through this dance workout.  She is joined by 4 other ladies, a couple of them I have also seen in Crunch workouts.  The are 2-15 minute dance routines, Afro-Latin and Reggae Funk.  A warm up and isolations segment precedes the dance workouts and the cool down follows.

The warmup is short and sweet, then you move into the isolations or dance basics segment.  These moves are designed to increase range of motion, coordination and muscle definition.  Some of the moves included her are shoulder rolls, hip circles, the box and more hip shakes.  This section is probably not necessary once you master the dance routines, but I find myself doing it anyway because I enjoy it, plus I like the music too.

Afro latin is the first dance routine consisting of african tribal and latin moves.  Steps seen here are the triple step, strong arm movements, salsa, shoulder shimmeys, african footwork/arm movements, mambos, play the drums/maracas, double lunges, and hip shakes & shimmeys.  Marie will show the move first slowly, then will add arm movements, then will do the move at tempo, repeating a few times.  She does this for all the steps, once each move is added and practiced a few times, she will take the routine from the top. Once all the steps are learned, you will run through the entire routine twice at the end.

Reggae funk is the second dance routine, steps in this segment include reggae groove, single single double steps, twist & shrugs, drop & roll, butterly, dig & freeze, and willy bounce and mambo sunshine.  Marie teaches this one in the same manner.  The routine starts out a little slow matching the music but picks up at the end and is a lot of fun.  After this segment Marie leads you through a brief cooldown and stretch.

I really like this video, Marie is a great instructor.  I liked her quite well in Crunch Cardio Dance Blast and was hoping I would find another video with her in it.  This video is good for clutzy types like myself, the steps are pretty easy to pick up, though I can't seem to get the single single double step down for some reason.  Ths music is good, the set is clean and bright, and Marie and her participants seem to be enjoying themselves.  Is this workout a sweatfest?  No, but it's a nice way to get some light cardio and is great for days you are not up to a strenuous workout but want to get some movement. I find that I can be really lazy in the cardio department at times, but usually can muster up the energy to do this video.

There are a few additional features on this DVD, a fitness do's and don'ts segment led by Chris Freytag, who leads many of the Prevention Fitness DVDs.  There is also a Spanish instructions option, which I haven't seen in  another workout.  Overall I highly recommend this one.  It has taken me a while to find a dance workout that I really like, I finally did.",1163894400,49,2952,4.469158878504673
2595278,4,B000FZETV6,"I liked this work out. It is very easy to follow. The instructor, who is very likable, gives good instructions.  She gives each dance move a ""fun"" name, so it is easy to remember. I do this work-out when I want to work-out, but do not have as much energy as usual or I will do it as a warm-up to another work-out. It always puts me in a good mood. I liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section. If you are looking for a hard-core dance fitness work-out that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat, this is not for you. If you are looking for a fun, easy work-out, then this is for you.",1163116800,7,622,3.976
2595279,4,B000FZETV6,This was a fun workout.  It really gets the heart rate up and it is easy to follow.,1163030400,5,83,3.611111111111111
2595280,5,B000FZETV6,"If you have reasonable expectations of exercise DVDs, then you will ignore the review written by ""AMAZON FAN"" and take heed of all of the other reviews.  Because this DVD is classified as a 'Fitness & Yoga' DVD, you do have to assume that it is a DVD for exactly that, 'Fitness'.  It is not, nor is it ever intended to be, an instructional for dance.  You're browsing in the wrong category if thats what you're after.  In fact, if you want to learn how to dance and will find yourself disappointed with any aerobics-esque moves, then shut down the computer now and go and sign up at your local dance studio.

I own several dance aerobics DVDs and this is one of the best that I've tried so far - only topped by Madonna Grime's African Beat-Latin Heat DVD.  Few dance DVDs strike that balance between being dancy enough to be original & fun, and being easy to follow.

This is as close as it gets to a perfect balance.  Marie Forleo is a fantastic instructor, and goes through fast moves at half tempo a few times before letting it fly at full speed.  That being said, full speed isn't breakneck speed; you are still able to actually DO the moves without compromising form.

Here's what you get:

5MIN WARMUP - Marie takes you through about a 5min warmup that incorporates toe taps and step-touches - your basic aerobics stuff to get you started, and then with a few stretches to follow.  Its not incredibly innovative stuff, but hey, its the warmup.  It does its job, and thats all you can ask.

ISOLATIONS - Now this is a good idea for those who are inexperienced with dance aerobics.  This short segment guides you on correct form when performing the moves, and is a must-do for those who are new to this sort of thing, and in particular, those who are inflexible in the hips.

15MIN AFRO-LATIN DANCE SEGMENT - This is my favourite segment on the DVD.  Marie goes through the majority of the moves at half tempo first - some of them are basic enough to learn at full tempo.  There is some pretty quick footwork in a salsa move that she teaches at the beginning of the combination, though with a few times practice you should have it down.  What struck me the most about this segment was that halfway through it the music suddenly picked up and was cleverly synched with the combination.  The first half is very much a 'getting-your-heart-rate-up-and-learning-the- moves' segment and the music at this point is fairly stock-standard stuff.  At the halfway point the music suddenly resembles that of a Brazilan Carnival, and it is at THIS point where you really start to get into the groove of the workout and find yourself having a blast.

15MIN REGGAE-FUNK DANCE SEGMENT - I wasn't too sure what to expect with this segment, since for me, Reggae Music has always made me want to go and lie down on a beach somewhere, rather than get on up and boogie.  The choreography in this segment is innovative and funky, but the music is exactly as Reggae music is - laid back.  The choreography does get your heart rate up and the moves are fun, but it doesn't draw you in like the Afro-Latin segment does.

5MIN COOLDOWN - Just like the warmup, this bit does its job.  Marie goes through a few simple, non-dance inspired, low impact moves to lower your heart rate.  Her stretches are not comprehensive, but they're not bad.

There are a few extras on the disc; particularly a segment presented by Chris Freytag on 'The Do's and Don'ts of Exercise'.  Rather than the Do's and Don'ts of 'Exercise', this is specifically of 'Toning', and she demonstrates what poor technique looks like and what you should be doing instead.

For those of you who have attempted the other Prevention Dance DVD with Jennifer Galardi, you can relax.  This DVD is nowhere near as fast paced as that one is.  That DVD is a Prevention Express DVD, where the segments are only 10 minutes long - designed for a 'pop-in-and-dash-out-the-door' lifestyle.  This DVD lengthens the segments a bit so that there is proper guidance on what to do, so you won't be left feeling as disheartened from trying to follow Marie's moves.

Is this an intense calorie burning, body blasting blitz?

By no means.

If you're looking for an intense cardio workout, this is not it.  And most Dance DVDs out there will not be it.  The best Dance cardio workout you can get are ones that are not on DVD; the Les Mills Body Jam and BTS Group Groove classes are the most intense out there, and no DVD can match it.  This can be viewed as a positive in that it is not disheartening for those who are starting out exercise, but for those of you who are experienced and are looking to 'take it up a notch', you are looking in the wrong place.

Marie has one other DVD out, the 'Cardio Dance Blast' DVD from Crunch, which I found to be a bit slow and not as aerobic as this one is - though I have no gripes about her personality at all.  She focuses more on technique  and cueing rather than trying to motivate you.  If you're looking for someone who will take your hand and walk you through a workout, congratulating you on every single step you take and telling you that you're beautiful and that they're proud of you, you need a Denise Austin workout.  Marie is NOT Denise Austin (for some of you, knowing that will be enough to buy this DVD! Ha!) and cues and teaches very well.  You need to do the motivating yourself.

IN SUMMARY
- 2 x 15min Dance Segments
- Isolations segment for newbies
- Afro-Latin Segment is most fun
- Choreography is innovative and funky
- Complicated and/or Fast moves are taught at half tempo first
- Not overly intense workout; perhaps ineffective for experienced exercisers
- Marie is a good instructor, but does not try to motivate

Highly Recommended!",1161561600,219,5722,4.50533462657614
2595281,5,B000FZETV6,I wanted a workout that would be fun and that would also make me sweat.  I love this DVD.  I have two left feet and it was so easy for me to pick up the moves.  Maria is a great instructor and she makes it so easy to follow the workout.,1160006400,7,236,3.588235294117647

I found this DVD and I absolutely love it just as the other one. She is a great instructor. The way she breaks out the steps and put them together makes it so easy to follow. I am having fun and working out at the same time. It is the perfect combination. I started dancing with her like a month ago and I already have very good results. Finally my waist is shrinking!

I highly recommend this DVD along with her previous one.",1158192000,12,560,4.036036036036036
2595283,4,B000FZETV6,"Prevention bring out some good workouts and this is another of them.  It's a fun dance workout that is easy to do because you sometimes don't realise that you are working out.

The instructor Marie, has been in a crunch dvd I have and she's good in that and good in this.  She's a good cuer and she's motivating too.  She begins to teach a base move and then shows it at a faster tempo and then adds on to that initial move.  The Afro/Latin section is the best because that's the funkiest and there are some cool moves.  There is also Regae/Funk .  The entire workout is about 50 or so minutes, but as I said, you don't realise you're working out, but in fact you are and you're also burning a lot of calories and fat.  This is good.  I enjoy it.",1155945600,38,746,4.125

2595315,3,B000FZETV6,"This dvd was really disappointing. It's not much of a workout, barely gets my heartbeat up. I was hoping for some great dance music but I can hardly hear the music, the trainers voice drowns it out. Waste of money even though it was cheap.",1384905600,,239,4.333333333333333

2595317,3,B000FZETV6,"I bought this DVD because I have other Prevention DVDs I like...mostly Chris Freytag. I have been working out a long time, so I am pretty fit, but I have asthma, which sometimes makes too vigorous cardio programs a problem for me. On the days I am having slight breathing issues, this is just right. Otherwise, it's a bit too easy. The dance moves are nice. Marie Forneo cues very nicely with enough time to change moves. Some moves I find do not flow into the next so easily, but I've only used it a handful of times, so that is probably just a matter of practice. The movements seem complicated at first, but sticking with it is the key. They have become much easier for me to follow with just a few tries. My biggest pet peeve with the DVD is that I cannot skip from the beginning intro, which is all advertising, directly to the menu. Additionally, it is not a mix and match format, where one can pick just the segments one wants. Other than that, for light exercise days or beginners, it's fine.",1377561600,,1000,4.352941176470588

The video definitely got my heart rate up, and the moves are fun to do. In the second dance, some of the moves feel a little awkward to do but were a great time. One in particular I call the leprechaun move.

The problem I have found with this DVD, and with MANY others, is that you really need to have good coordination in order to follow all of the moves.  Many times there are complicated foot movements that have left me ""marching in place"" as I try to bridge my confusion.  This can get very frustrating, but I have found this to be the case with many, many DVDs.  You put the thing in and five minutes later you are expected to perform a complicated, choreographed dance routine!  Please, don't misunderstand: if you are coordinated and catch on to new moves quickly, than this DVD is excellent.  But if you are more like me and you find yourself lost after the fourth or fifth move in the combination, you might want to keep looking.",1241136000,2,832,4.301282051282051

Wrong.  It is basically aerobics.  For people who are already in shape.

The photography is weird.  For example, you might be directed to move your feet 2 to the left, drag 1 to the right and quick kick kick kick and instead of showing you the steps, the video shows the pretty faces of the people exercising.

It would probably be fun if I was 20 years younger.  I am going to give it to my daughter who will probably have a ball with it.",1224201600,5,604,4.245614035087719

The routines are taught at a fairly quick pace, so it could be discouraging to someone who does not learn dance quickly.  The great part is that even when the basic movements are mastered, there is lots of room to develop technique, lending the disc to repeated play.

I like Marie Forleo, and I bought this DVD because I enjoyed her Crunch Cardio Dance Blast DVD.  Marie cues really well, and she's encouraging without being annoying.  You don't need a lot of coordination for this DVD.  Marie breaks the more complicated moves down in half-time to demostrate.  The only (minor) annoyance is that every time you learn a new move, you take the whole dance from the top, and it gets a little repetitive.

After the warmup, there's some isolations which I kind of felt that Prevention just stuck in there to lengthen out the workout.  I didn't find them to be necessary.

I enjoyed both the Afro-Latin and Reggae segments, but I sure got confused when I added in the arm movements!  The choreography is a bit complicated and I'll have to do this one a couple more times to get it down.  I was glad to see different dance moves than the norm though...

There's a LOT of twisting motions and more impact than usual.  Very tough to do on carpet unless you have dance shoes.  The impact can only be modified so much, so be prepared for a couple of hops here and there.

2595375,2,B000FZETV6,"Marie Forleo is nice, though almost no personality shows, she actually has some fluidity & can dance decently. But the boring gym stage, the sweats, and the horrible synthesizer music that was not motivating...
You do so many step touches. Before a new move, after a new move, in between the ""routines"" you build in each of the Isolations, Afro-Latino & Raggae-funk. The moves themselves are good, though modified & done at a slower tempo then they usually done, but at least they are real dance, not aerobics. Mostly only Marie & the woman on the right really move/enjoys dancing/some style, the others are too rigid & seem to move like it's aerobics & no fluidity.
This would be SOO much better if the pace overall was faster, almost no step touches, more instruction (NOT slower) & more repetition fast paced of a move before going on to the routine & and dancing at real tempo with music that is at least 120+ bpm that makes you want to dance.
This is only for people who never danced, can't dance & get intimidated easily, those who are new to exercising, or those need something very light.

I'm not the most coordinated of people (the arm movements with the footwork DOES still mess me up!)but I enjoy it and recommend it for beginners.",1194307200,4,674,4.357142857142857

2595379,4,B000FZETV6,"I am a cardio dance instructor with no real formal dance training.  I buy DVDs to get ideas for my classes which are women ages 20-60 who have no dance experience.  The moves on this DVD are fun and easy.  Marie is one of my favorite instructors.  She goes through the movements at half tempo plenty of times for you to get the moves down before taking them up to tempo.  However, this DVD is not going to get your heart rate really high unless you are a complete couch potato.  However, once you learn some of the moves, you can create your own workout and perform it to a little faster music.  This is a great DVD for anyone including instructors looking for fun dance ideas for class!!!  Marie teaches on another video by Crunch called Cardio Dance Blast which is also a fun workout.  She is also seen on two of the Dance off the Inches DVDs: Fat Burning Jam and Sizzlin' Salsa both of which are fun.",1184976000,9,903,4.264705882352941
2595380,4,B000FZETV6,I WANTED A DANCE CD/EXERCISE PROGRAM.. THIS IS A GOOD STARTER CD.. I JUST WISH THERE WAS MORE DANCING TO IT.. A LOT OF IT IS EXERCISE LIKE. SO FAR SO GOOD THOUGH.. IT MAKES YOU WORK UP A SWEAT FOR A BEGINNER LIKE ME.,1184716800,2,216,3.8222222222222224
2595381,2,B000FZETV6,"I got this because I wanted some fun exercise, and it was recommended by other reviewers as easy. But the footwork was too difficult for me.  It wasn't well explained or demonstrated and the leader went on after only 2 repetitions.  Not for me.",1182729600,7,244,4.5227272727272725

2595404,2,B000FZETV6,"I thought that I would really like this video after reading the reviews.  It was just okay.  It didn't really get my heart rate up much and I found it to be a little boring, not too fast paced.  BTW, I am used to stepping with Cathe on a 3 time per week basis and doing some sort of strengthening the other 3 days.  So, if you are just starting out you might like it.",1170892800,12,367,3.8533333333333335
2595405,2,B000FZETV6,I was disappointed with the CD.  I was expecting a workout that was more high energy to make me sweat. It wasn't hard enough and I barely broke a sweat. More for beginner fitness people.,1170720000,12,186,4.314285714285714
2595406,5,B000FZETV6,"This is a fun, high energy workout.  I was a little nervous when I first started.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to keep up, but the instructor goes over the moves repeatedly and by the end of the video I had the routine down.  It was so much fun.  I would definet;y recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to have fun while they exercise.",1170201600,10,357,3.9859154929577465
2595407,4,B000FZETV6,"I think this is a great video if your just looking for light, fun cardio workout. I know some days I'm exhausted, and I'd like to workout, but I don't feel like pushing myself super hard. This video gives you the chance to burn some calories and do a little dancing. The first segment is a cool afro/latin combination that I like shaking my hips to. And the second is a reggie funk sequence that has you bouncing around. All in all, a decent video. SHe certainyl breaks down the moves so they are very easy to learn - just don't expect an intense workout.",1169337600,17,555,4.295238095238095
2595408,2,B000FZETV6,"I was so looking forward to doing this workout. I love salsa music & dancing & I love, love reggae & found it intriguing that a workout could have reggae dancing.  Unfortunately this workout left me wanting more, & not in a good way.  I figured I'd give it a chance, because the instructor is likeable, and the music is great.  So I did it for a few weeks, got real familiar with the moves so I could really put my all into it.  However, even when I really work this routine, I'm hardly out of breath.  The instructor gets sweaty & I always wonder how, since this is a workout ""lite"".  It is good if you want a long warm up, which is how I've used it a few times, since after I was done I felt like I hardly worked out at all.  It's sad because this one has many good points, however the workout itself is a true beginner routine at best.",1169078400,8,838,4.042424242424242

2595410,1,B000FZETV6,"I hate this product..Marie is so slow in moving to the next steps..I don't even work up a sweat.  I was hesitate in ordering workout videos and ordered 4 about 3 months ago, if your interested in starting an exercise program for the new year, order 10 Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix, Jennifer is GREAT and I promise you'll work up a sweat and enjoy it!  Don't let the ""10 Minute"" idea allow you to avoid ordering..once you get the steps down, you'll be amazed at how well her 10 minute exercises work!",1167436800,12,509,4.404255319148936

2595412,4,B000FZETV6,this workout is fun and easy especially for those of us with no cordination but love to dance. i've only done the whole dvd twice but i've got the moves down. you get what you put into the workout. you can cruise through to make it a light workout or really put some engery into it and sweat.,1165276800,7,292,4.051724137931035
2595413,5,B000FZETV6,I have two of the Prevention Fitness Systems dance videos and they are two of my three favorites.  I am familiar with the teachers from earlier Crunch dance work-out videos.  I have to work at it a bit to get my heart rate up to where I want it by putting in some extra oomph.  But it is do-able and I very much enjoy the routines.  They are the right length of time for me too.  I have a small amount of workout space and am able to do these in that space.  I look forward to my workout with this DVD.,1163894400,6,502,3.872549019607843

8128021,4,B000FZETV6,I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it and had fun learning new moves. I have her Crunch dance DVD and am addicted to that as it is fast moving and fun and more expressive. The Prevention DVD is reserved and slower but still useful for those days when not feeling well but want to do something. This woman is beautiful and a fabulous teacher and I hope she brings out more for me to purchase. Do not purchase this if you want a sweatfest or professional dance training although I am sure Marie would be brilliant as a dance instructor. Highly recommended!,1426204800,,571,4.345794392523365
