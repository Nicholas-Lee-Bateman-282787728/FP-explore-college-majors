8179796,3,B00009EIR4,"Pros:
Ling Chia and Chang Yi
Fight Choreography is acceptable
Some hilarious dubbing

Cons:
Story
One of those stories where the cool looking villain is the only really developed character and the only one for an actual motivation to do anything so  you sort of like him more.

Lingering questions:
Why did the elder  hit himself with a staff?
Why didn't bad guy bring his army with him?
Did they get lost?",1483660800,,406,4.597222222222222
8179797,4,B00009EIR4,"I came across this particular flick while checking out a few other Don Wang Toa flicks, I noticed it had a 4 star.  Having seeing that I felt compelled to check it out.  I duly a greed it's a 4 star.  I though this flick was very entertaining from the start to the finished.  It had fight scenes after fight scenes, consistant throughout the flick.  Importantly, the DVd transfer is acceptable.  it has a very tight story I though, and very easy to follow.  I would recommend this to any old school kung fu lover out there.  Wang Tao certainly perfomed in this one!!",1148774400,7,566,4.375
