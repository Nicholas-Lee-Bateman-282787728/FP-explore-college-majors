8369538,4,B002FRG7GM,"Arika wants to study at Garderobe Academy to become an Otome. Otome serve their masters and obey their every command. She is kind of an outcast at first, but Arika makes many friends at the Academy. She also makes many enemies, and even falls in love. She gains a special bond with the bratty young Queen Mashiro. By a strange turn of events, she becomes the Queens Otome before she's completed her 1st year at Garderobe. She tries to keep it a secret, but a conspiracy is in the works that will test her courage and determination.

This series is pretty good. I was very disappointed at 1st, but the story improved as it progressed. The characters were developed well, the animation is good, and the soundtrack fits the mood of the show. I like the voice acting for the most part. Many of the voice actors from the original My Hime are back. Some of the characters from My Hime are also in this series. This isn't a sequel so much as it is an alternate retelling. You don't need to see the original series to understand this one. I do recommend watching My Hime first, b/c it's better than My Otome. The characers, plot, and just about everything else in the original series is better. You do get to see some of the original characters like Natsuki, Shizuru, Mai, and Mikoto. Many of the other supporting characters are also in this retelling. If you have seen the 1st series and liked it, I think you'll like My Otome as well. Just don't expect quite as much.",1356307200,,1461,4.451492537313433
