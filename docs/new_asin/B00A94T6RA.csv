8548693,5,B00A94T6RA,"A sudden opportunity to work as a paid video editor meant that I had to learn Sony Vegas Pro from the ground up in a very short period of time.  After watching a few painfully amateur YouTube offerings, I found Mr. Kleiner's instruction videos easily accessible and remarkably polished.  He presents his scripted demonstrations using a large Wacom Cintiq for camera close-ups.  My impression is that he not only knows digital video, he knows how to teach.  Somebody who understands what it is like to not know a subject and so anticipates questions that a beginner will not know to ask.  His calm, flowing pace kept me focused and absorbed in the learning process.  I recommend his courses to video editing beginners before they spend a dime on any book or a moment on YouTube.",1369872000,3,777,4.718518518518518
