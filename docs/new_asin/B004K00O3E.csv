Condition with no scratches or malfunction when I
played them.  I would highly recommend this collection.
I got them at an excellent low price too.  I think buyin them seperately would have cost me ten times what
I paid.",1326758400,5,326,4.666666666666667

8432059,4,B004K00O3E,"So this is a great collection--obviously, 10 different movies from the '80s, most of which you remember by reputation if nothing else. It's great because it is a collection, meaning that the sum as a collective is greater than its individual parts. Across the board we have very early appearances by actors like Kelly Preston, Nic Cage, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise.

Lots and lots of nudity here in the pre-1984 releases, with the big winner's being ""The Last American Virgin"" (a sort of ""Porky's"" with younger actors, more heart and FAR better-looking girls). But it's pretty evident when the Reagan Administration took hold and things started getting more conservative; the releases in the later '80s often are slapped with ""R"" ratings for no understandable reasons.

The collection is pretty disjointed: ""Valley Girl"" is an interesting inclusion and actually has a director's commentary. ""Class"" and ""Secret Admirer"" are watchable. Some of the others are crap: ""The Rachel Papers"" was incredibly boring, aside from many nude scenes sandwiched into the last two thirds of the film. ""Johnny Be Good"" was atrocious on all kinds of levels.

If you can get this at a bargain price, and  you're a fan of the era (if not the genre), I recommend a buy.",1347840000,2,1243,4.9330143540669855
8432060,2,B004K00O3E,I GOT THIS AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE! BUT THE WAY IT WAS PACKAGE IT SCRATCHED THE DVD'S!! NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT IT IS PACKAGED!!,1330732800,2,135,3.857142857142857
8432061,5,B004K00O3E,"This is one of the better Multi-Film sets I've purchased. All the transfers are good, most films are funny, It is nicely packaged and there is plenty of T&A, The only dissapointment is ""Losin' It"" is in Fullscreen, that's the movie I had to have, It's still Hilarious! and I will still watch it many more times.",1330128000,,311,4.473684210526316
