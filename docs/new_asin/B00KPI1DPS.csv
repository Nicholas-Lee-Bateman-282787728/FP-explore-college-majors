8660608,4,B00KPI1DPS,"Of all the black comedies I have seen [OK, I haven't really seen that many] this has to be one of the blackest, and the oddest in a number of respects.  First of all: how do I even HAVE this DVD?  Curiously it is stamped ""return to Music Box Films"" on the title side, and periodically throughout the film, superimposed on the scene are the semi-transparent letters ""Property of Music Box Films"".  Yet I bought it online via Amazon, so I assume somehow it did get released.

Second: I'm sure that the description I originally read did not specify the whole sound track is in NORWEGIAN!  Yet it has been released in a North America DVD format and thankfully, well-done English subtitles are provided throughout.  Not speaking Norwegian, I'm unable to tell how faithfully the English corresponds to the Norwegian dialog all the time, but the English is quite well-done and [another bonus] the subtitles don't even record silly things like [dramatic music...] or [birds twittering] the way subtitles to some more expensive films do.

As for the plot, if you read too much about it, you very rapidly will find this plot spoiled for viewing.  Let's just say the main character, Oscar, who seems a decent if very unassertive type, has really poor choice in friends.  Four guys who work together [Oscar being one] pool some money to bet on a lottery and sure enough, they hit the jackpot!  It's 1 million 700-some thousand kroners [if I have the name of the currency correct].  From then on, people keep threatening poor Oscar's life, yet somehow he lives on and other people keep dying.  Like a Shakespearean comedy piling improbability on top of improbability, part of the comedy here is the sheer bizarreness of how the plot unfolds.  A second aspect of the ""dark"" part of comedy here involves the use of copious amounts of fake blood.  I'm pleased to report there is no reveling in sadistic details to the extreme of a slasher-film, but it's only one notch down from that extreme.  Lastly there are some comedic aspects to the dialog and how...well, dumb some of the characters sound at times-almost like Forrest Gump meets murder mystery.

At least in the English sub-titling, vulgarity is pretty tame for an R-type movie and there's no sex or significant nudity.  There's a fairly short scene involving ""exotic dancers"" in the background but that's about as sexually explicit as it gets.  No, the ""R"" here would all have to do with violence.

Although Kyrre has the lead role here, I particularly enjoyed the second male character, Mads Ousden, who is visually reminiscent of Russell Crowe.  Basically everyone's acting was pretty good.  Plot could have I think benefitted from just a bit more polishing especially at the end, but this stayed engaging all the way through a fairly standard hour and a half.  If you watch sub-titled foreign films and enjoy black comedy you should certainly enjoy the film.",1466553600,,2903,4.810483870967742
8660609,4,B00KPI1DPS,"In the desolate back-country of Norway four co-workers win enough money to buy about 650 bottles of liquor.  Unless the subtitles were wrong.  An enormous bloodbath follows.  I could not tell if this was supposed to be a comedy or a crime ""thriller"", but at least it had a surprise ending that didn't really change anything.",1447891200,,324,4.75
8660610,5,B00KPI1DPS,"The film opens with the cops discovering bloody Oscar Svendsen coming to at a strip joint surrounded by dead bodies and a shotgun in his hand. Oscar explains to the detective what happened. It seems Oscar and his three criminal buddies won a betting pool with a large prize, a prize too big to share.

The film is a smartly done dark comedy. I was amused for nearly the entire film as something odd and unexpected would pop up in nearly every scene.

Guide: F-bomb in subtitles. Background nudity.",1420848000,,497,4.573033707865169
