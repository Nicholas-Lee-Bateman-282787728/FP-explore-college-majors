6135608,4,B00H7D92F2,Forest Whitaker and Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job.,1408406400,,54,5.111111111111111
6135609,3,B00H7D92F2,"I only got this dvd because of Orlando Bloom's nude scene. He looks amazing, his body is in ridiculous shape and while I would have preferred that he did the whole movie naked I'm not complaining. It's a standard detective drama with shooting etc. Funny to see the English speaking actors dubbed into French. My French is poor but the story is so simple that I was able to follow along",1403740800,,385,4.436619718309859
6135610,4,B00H7D92F2,"In South Africa two police officers set out to solve the brutal death of a young woman and end up in a battle with drug dealers who are selling a new synthetic drug that can induce extreme violence or suicidal tendencies.  It is a very intense and brutal movies.  The two stars Forrest Whitaker, a straight laced cop, and Orlando Bloom, a drug and alcohol fueled loser, find themselves in over their heads and outgunned by the drug cartels.  Good movie, but very dark.",1402531200,,468,4.5476190476190474
6135611,5,B00H7D92F2,"This French film is set in South Africa. All actors seem to be from there, except the two stars: Forest Whitaker in a brilliant role as police captain with a victim past, and Orlando Bloom in an unusually adult role of a womanizing and boozing police lieutenant. The film was shown at last year's Cannes festival, but it had escaped my notice.
It is immensely dark and brutal, quite shocking even for a hardened thriller fan. The subject is drugs, of a new, experimental kind. The new molecule blocks inhibitions to violence. Overdoses may lead to unbelievable aggression, possibly suicidal aggression. The lab that developed the product needed test persons... Enough said.

The film has similarities to the Latino cartel genre, like Oliver Stone's (Savages) or Ridley Scott's (The Counselor) versions from recent years, but transferred to the rainbow country, under its special social conditions. It is very intense and compelling. One of Whitaker's best performances.",1401062400,,969,5.211538461538462
6135612,4,B00H7D92F2,"When a teen girl is discovered brutally murdered, the task of solving the crime falls on two detectives. Ali Sokhela  (Forest Whitaker)  was a childhood victim of  Inkhata. He is part of the forgive and forget crowd, but carries the scars both emotionally and physically. He is teamed with womanizer Brian Epkeen (Orlando Bloom) a man who pops pills, likes his drink and is basically a mess. He has an ex-wife and is behind on his child support. Our protagonist is greatly flawed.

Upon investigating the murder they uncover a sinister synthetic drug ring with a world wide network . The film is a fairly decent crime drama. Some of the language is Afrikaner while other may be Zulu. Most of the film is in English.  I thought the native born Texan Forest Whitaker did a good job with the accent. The film holds your attention, but doesn't grab you. A good film sure to blend in with the rest after you've seen it.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Nudity (Orlando Bloom -wears a C-sock,  Joelle Kayembe,  + others) 3 1/2 stars",1400716800,2,1018,4.616666666666666

8630400,3,B00H7D92F2,"Would be nice if it had English subtitles throughout the film not just when speaking another language. I'm deaf and partial subtitling is irritating to me. This version is in English and Dubbed: Afrikaans. Got it because of Orlando Bloom, I'm a big fan.",1493769600,,253,4.7727272727272725

8630404,2,B00H7D92F2,"The dialogue was difficult to understand and hear, most of the characters mumbled through their lines. The movie action was very bloody. This is not a movie I'd recommend to a friend.",1477094400,,183,4.75
8630405,5,B00H7D92F2,"Hits hard and fast never lets up. The fresh wounds of Apartheid and the TRC are fertile ground for a complicated intrigue of corruption and murder. A mutilated body is found in Kirstenbosch, the beautiful botanical gardens of Cape Town. The symbolism need not be subtle. Drugs and gangs are beyond control in a nation with no sense of itself. Bloom and Whitaker are Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, except Bloom is awesomer and Whitaker is never too old for this excrement. It gets complicated quickly, and the action pulls no punches. Cannot recommend highly enough.",1459209600,,563,4.875
8630406,4,B00H7D92F2,"A very skillful adaptation of the novel by Caryl Frerey. Violent,  bloody,  and profane story of South Africa today focussing on the damage of past injustices on the main protagonists, white as well as black. Top notch performances throughout. French subtitles provide a lighter touch of "" So that's how you say That in French. """,1441670400,,329,4.857142857142857
8630407,4,B00H7D92F2,"Not to be confused with the 1960's 'Stanley Baker' 'Michael Caine' Classic.
ThIs is set in South Africa however -
When a girl is brutally murdered ' Chief of Police 'Ali Sokhela' (Forest Whitaker) leads the investigation along with 'Brian Epkeen'
(Orlando Bloom)
'Brian' though a good-cop is a mess, his private life a shambles, his home life leaving much to be desired....
The deeper the two dig the more complex the case becomes, their are sinister sides to this investigation as they learn of a connection
to a Global-Drug ring, it seems drugs that are on the streets cause both violent and suicidal reactions.
The closer they get to the truth the greater the risk as things spiral out of control soon finding themselves in the middle of a drug war on
the streets.
When a confession for the girls killing surfaces the two are told the case is closed....trouble is they are in way too deep to step back....
though there will be consequences.
Both - 'Forest Whitaker' and 'Orlando Bloom' put in quite a shift.
A gritty and frequently and graphically violent drama.....some nudity along with the usual measure of colourful language.
Good Picture and Sound Quality.",1434844800,,1164,4.825
8630408,1,B00H7D92F2,"The Enflish version of this is horrible.  One would think with Orlando Bloom and Forest Whitaker, both being English speaking, it would be OK, but it seems like after the movie was filmed, they went and dubbed the English after the fact.  Voices do,not match lip movement at all.  I even question if it's Bloom's voice.  The camera work is a bit off at times too, particularly in any action scenes.",1430697600,,398,4.563380281690141
