8354635,5,B000AY6JVU,"This is a travel guide/instructionaly guided tour of the Santa Catalina Island, or simply ""Catalina"" as it is referred to in this film, it was filmed in 2004-2005, and according to Amazon released on July 10, 2005. The film is aimed at people interested in sailing, or boating to, and around the island. Although there is some mention of lowering the sails and such, it mostly assumes that the viewer knows how to do those things. It does go into more detail about the proper ways for mooring and anchoring, but mostly as tips for when around others, or when out in deep waters, and a storm is on the way. The narrator Mark Ritts is seen briefly at the beginning, and can be glimpsed every now and then, but the crew blend into the background, so what is seen, is through the eyes of someone new the island. It gently moves from location, to location with scenery footage, and narration about what has been gone past. There are several interviews, but again the people asking the questions are not seen. It is as if the person is sitting down and talking to the viewer about this, or that topic which fits in with the story, and the travelogue. There are hardly any hand held shots, mostly onces done with kits to pan across the scenery, or zoom in without a wobble of the camera. They have also chosen great locations where they can get the sounds of nature without people talking in the background, and things of that type. There are a few lens flares here and there in some shots, but these are seen sparingly, to keep a sense of time. They also choose the right time of day for most shots, and seem to have done quite a bit of preplanning for scenes, like when they are in the water, and they want to show a view of that location from a distant hill, and then blend the two shots together. One of the main contributors to the film was Bill McNeely who wrote a book about the island. His helpful hints almost make up a film in themselves, much of his tips have been edited down, but can be seen in full on the bonus material. The story of the island's history is another treasure of the bonus material. However there is no chapter, or 'scene selection' option, it only has the option to watch the film from the begining, or watch the bonus features. Sadly there is no extra footage of Mark and the crew setting up the camera, or behind the scenes preparation for the film. In fact Mark Ritts, and his co- writer, producer, director, co-editor Ted Field, aren't mentioned by name except in the credits, where you can also learn that their boat ""Motu"" was captained by Marc Hamon.

The film begins with a view off the port side, looking towards the bow of the boat. It then lets the viewer enjoy the silence of the sailing, and water splashing up against the hull. Then Mark Ritts the narrator begins talking about how tranquil sailing can be. It then shifts to a aerial, or at least from a large hill, view of a tiny boat in a vast stretch of water. Mark then tells how the journey began, and there is footage of the harbor of Marina del Rey, in Los Angeles County. There is then a opening 3D animation as Mark says ""It's easy to 'Cast Off for Catalina'."" which is a island about 22 miles way from Los Angeles city, and Catalina's size is about 22 miles across. Mark himself is then seen loading the boat with supplies after which it returns to the 3D animation showing the two main destinations on Catalina Island, and several anchorage locations.

They then give safety tips about how to get ready for the journey, and author Bill McNeely also talks about safety and preparations. It then shows the course they will take to get there. Early in the film Mark is seen wearing a rain coat, type jacket, but later at about this point he takes it off, and you can get a glimpse of his ""Beakman's World on Tour"" shirt, {a television show that Mark Ritts appeared on as ""Lester D. Rat"", a guy in a rat suit, who acted as stage hand, and lab assistant to the show's host Beakman played by Paul Zaloom, it also featured one of three female assistants during the course of it's 4 seasons, and 91 episodes}. He also did much of the narration for the show, done here in pretty much the same way, with occational bits of humor thrown in. Mark then tells the viewer about the two best times for departure to the island.

Once they are underway, they talk about how shipping vessels are constantly along the route, and to watch out for them. They also show some of the wildlife such as dolphins, whales, seals, and seagulls. While still in sight of land they give pointers as to when to turn, and head out into deep water.

They next arrive at the harbor of Avalon, the only large city on the island. They then tell the viewer about the boarder patrol. They then let Brian Bray, the Harbor Master tell the viewer about how to interact with the patrols, which tell the sailors where they can moor-up, {to tie-up} their boat, they also collect the mooring fee.

Mark then tells about the best times to arrive, and that their are no reservations for places for mooring a boat, but their are still places outside of the city. He then tells about the busiest times, and what times such as festivals that it is nearly impossible to find a place park a boat. They then mention anchoring areas, and that they would need special equipment to use them, which luckily they mentioned before, so it shouldn't be a surprise.

They then have the Harbor Master explain the procedure of mooring a boat. This is accompanied by actual footage of the process being done, in a quick and trouble free fashion. There are also interviews with other unnamed patrol officers, giving helpful hints, and suggestions.

Bill the author then cautions travelers not to dump anything into the water, such as sewage, as this is illegal. And how the patrol will inspect the toilet of any boat shortly after its arrival, to make sure there are no leaks. They then show where the fuel dock, the free holding tank pump out station, and places to get fresh water. They then explain the two different ways to get to shore.

Bill the author, next tells about the strong Santa Ana winds that can harm the boat if placed in the wrong location. They then go ashore, and Mark reads a passage from a poem of Alfred Lord Tennyson, called ""Idylls of the King"". While the viewer is shown scenery footage of Avalon. They then interview the Executive director of the island's museum Stacey Otte, as she tells the history of how the city got its name from the poem. She and Mark then tell about other important places in the town such as business man William Wrigley, Jr.'s, {famous for chewing gum, and owning a baseball team} old house. They then take a look at some of the museum's items, which claims to have 7,000 years of island history. It then tells about the Catalina Casino, of which the museum is part of the same building.

There is then video, and images of scenery from various locations, this is set to music. They then show tourists arriving, and tell about hotels, restaurants and other accommodations. They then stop off at the island's nine hole golf course. They then head up into the hills, and tell about the horse back trails, and tour rides through the hills. They then stop at the plateau airport, afterwards they interview Ann Muscat, the president and CEO, of the 'Catalina Island Conservancy', as she tells about how they are trying to preserver the island in its natural state as much as possible. Then Mark tells about the hiking, bike trails, and camping areas which require a permit to use. They then look at the wildlife of the island.

They soon return to the boat, and Bill the author, then tells about how to cast off from a mooring, which is demonstrated with actual footage as he is talking. There is then a quick view of the map showing their route to Two Harbors, more of a way point then a actual town. Along the way they show the viewer some sights to watch for, with footage taken from under water, while Mark explains how clear the water is, and to watch for things like flying fish. He then talks about opportunities for scuba diving, and snorkeling. Next they show various locations for mooring, and anchoring, along the way, with a explanation of how many boats can be accommodated at each.

Author Bill then talks about a cove location called Italian Gardens, and some safety tips. Mark also gives advise about trying not to disturb the environment. Bill then talks about Ripper's Cove. During their journey to Two Harbors they also show images of what the locations look like from the hills, as well as their view from the water.

As they arrive at the harbor Mark explains the mooring, and anchoring procedures there. As they show how to do this, the viewer also gets to see a better view of the back of his ""Beakman's World on Tour"" shirt. As they go ashore at Two Harbors, they have Stacey of the museum tell about what the area is like, and what the travelers will find there. Bill the author also talks about it, and that 'Two' Harbors actually has 'just one' of everything. Mark then gets his chance to tell all about the various attractions, while music plays, and various footage of scenery is shown.

The next morning they set off again, after doing the various checks mentioned earlier, which thankfully Mark talks about while more of the scenery is seen. They then show the map again, and the route they will take to the other side of the isthmus to a place they call Cat Harbor {or Catalina harbor}. Along the way Mark points out various locations, but this time with no hillside view looking down. This side of the island is mostly rocks, and dirt hills, but Mark says its good for expert diving from the rocks, and there are also bald eagles to watch. One of the more interesting places on this side of the island, is a place where the rocks have streaks of different minerals in them, called Ribbon Rock.

Ann of the Conservancy then tells about the animals that are on Catalina Island, and that some aren't found anywhere else. Author Bill then talks about Cat{alina} Harbor. They then stop at Little Harbor, and there is footage from the hills showing places to be careful, or avoid entierly, as Mark explains the dangers. He then explains on this side of the island there are 'big game' fish, but that they tried fishing, and didn't catch anything.

They then come to The Palisades a series of hills on the shore that can protect a boat from storms. Bill the author gives a brief tip about them. They then return to Avalon, and describe some of the things they see when arriving there, such as the glass bottom boats, for viewing the under water environment. Bill then gives some sailing tips about how to get back the the mainland depending on where you are heading towards. Mark however then informs the viewer that maybe they'll stay just one more night, as the sun sets behind the boat as the credits roll. The credits list Jay Dubin as the package and graphics designer, along with a link to his webpage. He was also the director of nearly all the Beakman's World episodes in which Mark appeared. TAfter the credits there is a rather long disclaimer/warning about things possibly changing if the viewer goes to these places, and that they shouldn't be blamed if the viewer gets lost, or doesn't follow current government regulations when sailing, or visiting the island.

The DVD's only bonus footage is of extended versions of the interviews seen in the film;

The film gives a good sense of the time, and the preparations that would be needed by the viewer, if they were to take the journey, which the film present. The viewer probably wouldn't finish all of what they show in the same amount of time, but it shows most of the key points in making a journey to the island. It flows swiftly from topic, and location to location, while still keeping the feeling of not being rushed, while trying to cover all the parts that a visitor might want to know about. Whether you want to visit the island in real life, {or just enjoy staying at home, and avoiding the chance of sea sickness, by watching the film}, this film gives a great overview of the island. And with something like Google Maps, or Google Earth, you can feel like you've actually been there. Thankfuly there are no scenes of fish, or other animals being caught, and butchered as in other travel type films, although a small child can be seen holding up a headless fish at one point, which is about half the child's size. If your like me, and enjoyed watching Mark Ritts on the television show ""Beakman's World"", it's like going on a personally guided cruise with one of your heroes, and what could be better then that? Of course, to do it a second time. If you liked this film, then it is time to go and watch their second 2007-2008 film, this time to ""Cast Off for Mexico"".

A shortened version of the film was shown on The Sailing Channel as episode 105 of ""Sailing Channel Theater"", this version is only half as long, and has a introduction and after thoughts by Tory Salvia.

Since the relase of this film Bill McNeely has updated his ""Cruising Catalina Island"" 0975958801 for a second edition. ISBN: 097595881X with about twice as many pages.
