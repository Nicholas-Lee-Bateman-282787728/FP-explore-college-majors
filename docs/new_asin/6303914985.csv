753123,4,6303914985,"If you are familiar with Polanski's earlier artisticachievements and feel close to the way he reveals ""the darkside"" of human mind and spirituality, Polanski's very own realism, black comedy, slowly unfolding and buildup mystery and suspense, ""psychedelics"", if you watched and liked some of the films he made (""Knife in The Water"", ""Repulsion"", ""Cul-de-sac"", ""The Fearless Vampire Killers "", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Macbeth"", ""Chinatown"", ""The Tenant"", ""Tess"", ""Frantic""), you may also enjoy ""Bitter Moon"" (""Lunes de fiels"").
Interestingly, Polanski seems to have always been married to mysteriously beautiful women actresses, and cast them in his movies: the American Sharon Tate, whom he cast in the delicious spoof of vampire films ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", and French Emmanuelle Segnier, who does very well next to Harrison Ford in ""Frantic"", Polanski's 1988 mystery-thriller set in Paris..  I admire Seigner (as I do other French actresses of her generation, such as Parillaud, Beart, Adjani), and. although I must admit, I have not yet watched the 1999 ""The Ninth Gate"", which is the very last film Polanski ""made for her"", I feel that ""Bitter Moon"" could very well be ""her"" movie.  I was less preoccupied with the exact details of the story, instead I was just fascinated with Seigner's performance.  Sober, ""correct"" English couple played by Hugh Grant - Kristin Scott-Thomas is there to emphasize by contrast, Emmanuelle Seigner's French character.
Polanski captures the diversity and intricacies of a woman's mind: innocent youth, passionate love, total dedication to her partner, and then , when passion vanishes and there is no room for just a bit of friendship-companionship, what follows is emptiness, desolation, despair that leads to human degradation, and, in the end, tragedy.  Do not look just for the steamy lovemaking scenes - appreciate Seigner's character in its entirety !
""Bitter Moon"" is, definitely, not a masterpiece, and does not call for Academy Awards as was the case with ""Chinatown"" and ""Tess"", but I sense it is a good movie coming from Polanski, the artist who was born in Paris, lived and produced in Eastern Europe and France, then, for short time found himself across the ocean in Hollywood, and now is ""back"" in Paris.",948758400,8,2260,5.269444444444445

  Directed  beautifully with dynamic acting. The story is never boring and always  intreging,my only complante now is where can I find the book this film is  based on.",935452800,4,370,4.545454545454546

Dysfunctuional  relationships abound in this twisted view of romance that could only have  come from one of the most brilliant directors of our time--Roman  Polanski.

This is a great film, but it's NOT a good film to watch on your  first date with someone special...If on the other hand, your relationship  is getting tired and dreary, this film may be just the thing to perk it  up... :)",917308800,,587,4.696078431372549

753489,2,6303914985,"This is a silly movie that goes to great lengths to titillate. My impression is that Roman Polanski made this move so he could pay his electric bill. Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas are in this -- and I can only figure that, like all aspiring actors -- which they were when this flick was made --  they jumped at the chance to work with the great Roman Polanski. Moreover, ""Bitter Moon"" is a must for Peter Coyote fans -- all 12 of them. I'd have given this move 1 star, because it's so dopey, but it's beautifully photographed in typical Polanski style. If you want a cheap thrill and want to see nice cinematography, this is for you. If you have something better to do -- anything -- get started on that, instead.",1465344000,,719,4.325925925925926

753642,5,6303914985,"This tragedy starts like a syrupy love story, but quickly changes to tragicomedy and heart-wrenching tragedy.  Several times as I watched, I cringed at the awkward, embarrassing, painfully engaging relationship of an American bachelor (Peter Coyote in his best role - by far), who is an aspiring writer in Paris.  The Vangelis soundtrack, especially the opening song, is fantastically romantic and carries the heavy emotions of this film.  This story is a rare, unsparing look at a love affair, the ensuing bliss and, inevitable crash.  Hugh Grant plays a curious, frustrated husband who lives vicariously through the retelling of Coyote's tragic love story.  Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as Grant's spouse, lacking his attention and Emmanuelle Seigner the gorgeous girlfriend of Coyote, who entrances, seduces and then becomes sadistic when love sours.  The script is ambitious, profound, and pivots quickly from romantic drama, to comedy and tragedy.  This film is best for mature adults.  Too deep for the young.",1464739200,3,1020,5.371069182389937

Today, ordinary television shows far more skin and the sexual act (every variation) is depicted with more deliberation and clarity. This seems very very tame. In fact, watching it makes me think that Roman Polanski made quite a career out of a penchant for voyeurism. His movies are stylish and oh, so naughty. How naughty? Not much by today's standards. But in their time, they could sell tickets and that is all that counted.

754315,2,6303914985,"I am a big fan of Polanski, but some of his films do not come together well.  This is one of his films where something was simply off, like Frantic or Pirates.  The premise is fun:  a crippled man tells the story of a passionate love gone horribly, catastrophically wrong; the audience is a staid British couple, whose marriage is stalled in affluent mediocrity.  Things get out of control, supposedly titillating the audience with revulsion to quickly follow.

Unfortunately, the actors - truly a stellar cast - don't give very good performances.  I will try not to reveal anything of the surprises in the plot.  Coyote is supposed to be a trust-baby artiste who settles for getting laid in Paris.  Seigner portrays a sensualist with the simplicity of a child.  At their core, they are both narcissists, unable to relate with true intimacy or work on a relationship like adults.  Their sexual passion is visually explosive, but the descriptions are ridiculous (Coyote calls her hot spot a ""carnivorous flower"") and, even if they're meant to portray his mediocrity as a writer, it is out of place.  Once they have explored all manner of humiliation and S&M, they run out of tricks and everything flips, so they try to hurt each other and yet can't let go.  So they  meet a couple on a luxury cruise and draw them in with their story and games.  Scott-Thomas and Grant, who are wonderful actors, come off as bored and boring idiots, though she does surprise a bit in the end, again off kilter and strangely out of character.

The only thing I can say is, it just doesn't work.  I couldn't believe in the characters, the situation is pretentious, the dialogue is silly, and the message about passionate love is superficial and overblown.

Coyote recites his lines as if he's reading them. The best thing about Seigner is her French accent.

754821,3,6303914985,"A short way into ""Bitter Moon"", you realise that in directing his real-life wife, Emmanuelle Seigner, Roman Polanski placed himself in the position of Peter Coyote's character, who seemingly takes perverse pleasure in watching his wife having affairs with other men. One wonders what was going on in Roman's head as he sat there with his megaphone while Coyote licked the milk spilling down Seigner's naked torso - even if it was just pretends? Seigner also performed a couple of other up close and personal, pants-free romps with Coyote later in the movie. Maybe everyone involved could have used a session or two with Doctor Phil to sort it all out.

It's very hard to separate the turbulent events in Polanski's life from his movies; surely they have defined his work to a degree, especially as he has so much control over what he does. Some films work better than others, but none can be dismissed out of hand - although there were a couple of moments in ""Bitter Moon"" when I thought that was where we were heading.

The film starts on a cruise liner as a young married couple, Nigel and Fiona Dobson (Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas), become involved with wheelchair bound Oscar Benton (Peter Coyote) and his seductive wife Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner). Benton has a goading nature and takes delight in telling Nigel details of his life with Mimi, sparing no juicy detail. He tells how he went from lust to obsession then to absolute disdain before becoming totally dependent on her when he landed in the wheelchair.

When Nigel learns that Benton practically throws his wife at other men, he becomes entranced with her and is determined to be one of those men. However, near the end, Nigel and Fiona receive a jolt that reignites their marriage, or so it seems as the ship sails off into the sunset.

It wasn't until halfway through the film, about the time Benton entered the disdain phase of his relationship with Mimi that I think I finally got this movie - it's a comedy - a dark one to be sure. The change of pace midstream, especially when Benton starts to bully Elsa, is pretty ridiculous, and I really don't think his performance is all that convincing from that point on unless it's all seen as a big joke played on the hapless Nigel - then everything falls into place.

Although definitely over-the-top, ""Bitter Moon"" moves at such a fast pace that it doesn't give you much time to think about the inconsistencies. Just waiting to see how far Polanski will let his wife go is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat without worrying about the story.

I think the film can be grouped with other Polanski films such as ""The Tenant"", ""Frantic"" and ""The Ninth Gate""; way better than his misfires, but ultimately not as well realised as ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Chinatown"", ""The Pianist"" or ""The Ghost Writer"".",1418688000,,2821,4.688888888888889

754828,5,6303914985,"This is another of Polanski's epic films.  It is not for everyone and some will cringe and run in its portrayal of human brutality and sexual liberty.  Some will fault the film for no other reason than being unable to understand its intricacies and meaning.  It is in many respects a modern ""Of Human Bondage"".  It is the tale of a man who is smitten by a woman and pursues her, only to eventually lose his feelings for her and actually exert his wrath and disgust on her.  She, in turn, loves him, adores him and idolizes him until his hatred of her, while resulting in a continued devotion to him in his eventual crippled state, attacks her emotions in an unparalleled way.  Her feelings have been compromised and her devotion now lacks the love necessary to complement it.  The ending is true to form and while shocking, it could end no other way.  The film is a sad commentary on the human condition.

I am not sure what happened to all the Polanski films but they seem difficult to secure.  Some are available but not as Region 1.  This is the Spanish edition (Region 1) and I was drawn to it because it has the original English dialogue and was a reasonable price.

754880,5,6303914985,"Wonderfully crafted, unique movie.  It is categorized as a comedy - why I have no idea as it encompasses mystery, thriller, drama, and horror genres as well.

Bitter Moon is unlike anything I have ever seen before and has become my favorite movie of all time.  I have seen other Polanski films and this is far and away his best.  I would not consider it ""arsty"" in the least although it does contain potent imagery and symbolism that dovetails nicely with the storyline, even if on a subconscious level - view more than once and you will discover what I mean.

Emmanuelle Seigner steals the show through all three acts and shines brightly as the enigma that is Mimi.  Her transformation from a naive young woman blindly in love; to a frail, broken person who loses her identity, dignity (and perhaps sanity); then eventually becoming an alluring, mysterious femme fatale is absolutely amazing.

She the essence of femininity from start to finish, even in places where you would never expect it (such as when she is extracting her vicious revenge).  Her performance is magnificent, flawless and so real you forget she is a movie character.

Coyote and the supporting cast are great as well but it is Seigner that carries the film and forces you to keep watching, even when you want to look away out of sheer misery for her (yes, there are some very gut-wrenching emotional scenes).  2+ hours fly by as you become fully absorbed in a surreal story of love and tragedy that you will never forget.

This movie is not soft porn or really about sex at all.  The reviewers stating this have missed the point of the film entirely or just are not mature enough to appreciate it on an emotional and psychological level.  It brilliantly combines tenderness, malevolence, passion, love, hate, jealousy, obsession, dark humor, and the macabre into a great piece of cinema that affords repeated viewings.",1371600000,3,1890,4.7784615384615385

754884,5,6303914985,"I've had a love-hate relationship with this Polanski for years. I could never quite make up my mind, but the fact that I have seen it quite a few times should count for something. I've now decided I REALLY like it. The bits I used to cringe at are actually quite funny and enjoyable and actually quite erotic (like Seigner pouring milk over her breasts) and all the SM stuff is laughable, but only because the characters in the end find it laughable. Coyote and Seigner's relationship really is a car-crash of a relationship and it has the commensurate attraction of such horrible events. There is a sort of patness to the way Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas's relationship is resolved, not to say melodrama in terms of the final scenes where Thomas and Seigner get it on and Coyote finally takes bitter revenge on Seigner (Mimi), but all this is preceded by an engrossing pattern of master/servant role-reversals very much in the tradition of the cyclical nature of life that Polanski has always been interested in. Coyote is brilliant as the writer manqu who one minute you hate and the next you pity. Seigner is a much better actress than I have given her credit for over the years, and she has a sense of humour behind the mask of her Parisian cool that is disarming. Bertolucci's The Conformist it isn't, nor is it of the stature of Repulsion, Cul de Sac, Rosemary's Baby, MacBeth, Chinatown, or The Tenant, but it does fit - if not slip - into Polanski's oeuvre. One other proof for me that it is a successful film is that I can never quite remember all the crazy plot machinations; every time I re-watch it, it surprises me.",1349740800,3,1635,4.5646258503401365

Vividly erotic variations on temptation escalate from lust to indulgence, manipulation, domination, emotional sadism, betrayal and vengeance, drawing the detached voyeur into a gut-wrenching maelstrom - but not simply for fleeting thrills.

With plenty to appeal to every sexual taste, at some point, the viewer himself becomes a party to the debauchery, rendering him disqualified to coolly pass judgement on any of the four characters' folly.  By the time consequences are realized, a lasting message of warning comes home to anyone who might have been inclined to trifle with infidelity or even casual flirtation.

The film will make you uncomfortable, very much so.  I wouldn't recommend fellas watching with their mate/significant other, as the movie deals with some aspects of human nature that most women would never admit exists and you could end up in the middle of an unneccesary real-life bru-ha-ha based on someone attempting to defend their hypocrisy.  The reality is many men 30+ years in age will completely identify with the behaviors of the rogue couple, for better or for worse...

Bitter Moon touched me - not in the typical sense of the word but it is a film that WILL connect with your emotions.  The character played by Polanski's wife absolutely oozes sex appeal, not in the plastic-anorexic-boob-job sort of way pop culture pushes in our faces, this girl is simply the embodiment of youthful femininity.  I wanted to love her through the screen.  The acting on Peter Coyote's behalf is horrible but paradoxically it makes the experience that much more effective.  Hugh Grant is simply a vessel in the movie, unobtrusive but absolutely vital to pulling it all together.

I won't get into specifics of the film's storyline, I hate when Amazon reviewers do that.  Just watch the movie.

I balked at adding my opinion on this movie given that there are already 50 or so others, but this movie is among my top 10 favorites and nobody has clearly reflected my reasons.

I first saw this movie because I like Hugh Grant.  It was quickly evident that this is not the kind of fluffy romantic role he is better known for.  The gut-wrenching drama of this story pulled me in at times so intensely I thought I could bear no more.

The intensity remains to the very end, leaving one with that painfuly enlightened feeling one experiences after a stern life lesson.  The plot deftly imparts to the viewer a socially redeeming message, without being preachy or predictable.

Bitter Moon is an emotional and erotic adventure.  Couples that watch this movie will have much to talk about.

Watch it with knowing as little as possible about it.  Be drawn into it the way you would be drawn into a carnival sideshow.

Director Roman Polanski, himself a sexual outlaw in the United States, takes the viewer to dark places as the two main characters progressively move from obsession to boredom with each other and ultimately begin to degrade and abuse one another.

I will not divulge any of the plot (too much has already been spilled in other reviews) and while the plot is amazingly thought out and delivered by Scorsese, the plot really does not matter as much as the characters and their stories.

What matters more in my mind is the characters (all brilliantly acted) who show sides that are deeply engraved in all of us (thankfully in less extreme denominations in most cases). The movie take the obsession, anger, feeling of guilt, revenge, pity, dependence, lust to the extreme but with a bit of soul searching we can relate to the underlying urges and feelings and if we allow it, the movie leaves one thinking afterwards remembering our own experiences and our own behavior in difficult situations over the years.

Nigel and Fiona, played by Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott, are a married couple that set out to take a cruise vacation of a life time, to India of all places.

The couple meets a young beauty by the name of Mimi, played by Emmanuelle Seigner, who seems to be ill by the voyage. Fiona takes her to the ladies room and they strike a friendship of sorts. They soon meet Mimi's husband, who is on a wheel chair, paralyzed from the waist down.

Peter coyote plays the part of the husband, a man that seems desperate for conversation and engages Nigel, who out of respect and pity, starts to listen to the man's stories and soon finds himself spell bound by the eroticism of the stories he tells.

The stories center on how he met Mimi, how their relationship started, developed and progressed to what it is today. As the hours go by you will find the stories so malevolent in nature, so sadistic, that you can not help but hope it all ends well, and yet you know the end shall shock viewers.

A staid and respectable, childless British couple celebrating that volitile aniversary, are heedlessly advised (in regard to the husband anyway) by an Indian sage that children are better marital therapy than a cruise to India. Lust takes over the seemingly conservative Brit played perfectly by Hugh Grant and makes a fool of him. Yes this happens to men all the time.

On said cruise the British couple run into the sexy French siren and her crippled, older, storytelling husband who latches on to the Brit husband to tell his never-published autobiographical novel slash cautionary tale. And as for the interior story of the writer and his French obsession, it shows how`greediness' for hedonistic fantasy can lead to dark, sadististic or at least regrettable behavior. Suffice to say, everyone learns this lesson in their own way in the end.

A subtle theme here is the portrayal of the failed writer, who buys into fantasy too strongly and tries to make life imitate art until both his life and art fall short of any success, (this, like the lust in the male seven year itch, is another truism - failed artists often go too far into fantasy forgoing realism which ultimately causes frustration and failure) other than telling his story orally to one mere chump on a cruise who completely misses the point and is ready to cash in his perfectly respectable life for a brief scandalous trist in the very manner that made the cripple such an abomiable obnoxious loser.

I first saw it ten years ago, during a library movie night that I'd ran with a friend.  We saw a preview for Bitter Moon during another movie and it looked fun so we rented it.  When it ended, the whole audience sat in silence for about two minutes.  We were frankly shocked by the ending...it was absolutely NOT what we had expected.

Bitter Moon is about a couple who go on a cruise to India to celebrate their seventh wedding anniversary. Almost immediately, they meet Mimi, who almost effortlessly weaves a spell around the husband, Nigel, played by Hugh Grant.  He's restless and eager for diversion, a fact that doesn't escape the notice of Oscar, Mimi's wheelchair bound husband.  Almost immediately, Oscar begans to play a game with the besotted husband, offering him Mimi if he'll only listen to their tale first.  And Nigel is immediately sucked into their wild yet desolate and depraved world, with occasionally darkly hilarious and inevitably devastating consequences.

I thought the cast was incredible for this film.  Emanuelle Seigner, playing Mimi, seems to get most of the criticism in the reviews.  Admittedly she's no Meryl Streep but she brings a vulnerability to the role of Mimi, even when the vixen's at her worst.  Hugh Grant is a bit stiff as Niles, but it suits the part well.  Peter Coyote is a sneering fiesta of bitterness and hilarity, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals the show as a wife determined not to be played for a fool.

754971,3,6303914985,"Bitter Moon is minor Polanski, an overlong but enjoyable black comedy about sexual obsession. It's not particularly deep, but it is occasionally very funny (the poodle and the toaster are particular highlights), with Polanski constantly aware how close to comedy the sexual act is in all its more desperate variations. Perhaps its this sense of pervading black humor amid the emotional sadism that prevents the finale from having the sting it's aiming for, but it's an interesting voyage.",1166227200,3,488,5.269230769230769

Bitter Moon emphasizes the worst in humanity and provokes a guttural disgust for the characters played by Peter Coyote and Emmanuel Seigner. Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas represent the pawnish almost innocent characters within Oscar and Mimi's sadistic game of emotional chess.

I would never identify this movie as a ""Black Comedy"" but more of an erotic drama dealing with the dark side of the human libido. You're drawn into the relationship of Oscar and Mimi as outsiders listening to the story of their life. Along with Hugh Grant's character, you listen to their story ...from the inception of their lusty affair to their tortured life where the only reason that they exist as a married couple is in a vain attempt to limit their damage to the rest of humanity. Two people bonded together in a never ending battle to inflict torture upon the other...where everyone else is pawns and collateral damage. The content is definitely not for kids and not for the timid.

754975,5,6303914985,"Oscar winning director Roman Polanski (Best Director, 'The Pianist') is the co-writer and director of this darkly humorous and very entertaining movie that has got more publicity (if any) from it's scenes with S&M. Too bad really, because this is one of the better films I've seen recently and probably my favorite film from Polanski (I've only seen The Ninth Gate & The Pianist though). Hugh Grant ('Love Actually') who usually bothers the living hell out of me plays Nigel, a British man who's on a cruise with his wife Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) on their way to India in an attempt to rekindle their marital bliss. Usually when a movie takes place in one spot throughout the entire thing, like on a cruise ship, turns out to be crap. While this movie doesn't really take place on the cruise ship, everything we see is being told from a person on the ship. Anyway, Fiona and Nigel have a strange encounter with a woman in the bathroom; Then Nigel winds up running into her in the bar on the boat. The woman is Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner, 'The Ninth Gate' & 'Buddy Boy'), who Nigel clearly is attracted to. After failing to seduce her in the bar, he runs into a man named Oscar (Peter Coyote) who's confined to a wheelchair. Oscar talks about Mimi, who happens to be his wife, for a few moments before leading Nigel into his cabin where he begins talking about his relationship with Mimi. These stories are what take up much of the plot. Nigel insists that he doesn't care about Oscar's stories, but he goes back constantly to hear more...Then Oscar reveals that once he's done with the story, Nigel is free to do what he wishes with Mimi. The movie has two twists at the end, both of which are actually surprising. This movie has some really great nude scenes on behalf of Seigner and portrays some sexual things that hadn't really been approached in films. But this isn't an S&M movie, at all. There's not even a huge amount of sex in it. But, sticking to plot, the movie is never dull and it's smart and entertaining. Coyote gave an Oscar worthy performance and this one of Grant's better roles.

Very sexually explicit.  This movie just pulls out all stops, hitting every emotional button on the way.  Never figured out exactly where it was going.  Film essentially about two people who love each other intensely - then it turns to hate, but they can never let go.  Ending took a real surprise turn.  Kind've sad, as it points out, that for a couple to last, there must be more than sexual fire.  There should be respect, companionship, and friendship.  Sex can never be all.

A relationship between two people who are so engrossed in each other for superficial reasons is bound to fail. What is boring is that the only thing they had interest in was sex. The script does not instruct the audience about what two people who are in love can do to further their relationship. It does not depict interesting situations like manipulation or control or playing hard to get, etc. It does depict how cruel one partner can be to another. Moreover, why a victim in a relationship would not want to leave and find someone else is unrealistic. A dog or cat would be a better companion than Peter Coyote's character.

According to Polanski, it is not love and hate which are opposite, but love and indifference. Obsessive sex gives way, at least between the two lovers of Bitter Moon, to a hatred as savage as cold-blooded murder or all-out war.

These extremities of love and hate work themselves out in a game of power and manipulation, and it remains the only vehicle by which these two can merge with one another so as to lose both their independence and the rest of their inhibitions and illusions. In the end, they become so bound up in their mutual need that the sex itself is no longer central. They might as well be prisoners lashed forever to the same stake, learning actually to enjoy the various torments that the other is able to inflict. Freud thought similarly that all sexual love was ultimately a form of masochism--identification with a partner whom one has caused to suffer. These questions are essential as long as the blood continues to throb in us; and, whether or not we find Polanski's story credible (I do), any thinking person would recognize it as a serious attempt to define who we humans are, both as rutting mammals and as something more.",1113868800,3,1334,4.75

Sometimes we get so used to intense feelings that we cannot (or do not want) to tell the difference between longing and needing and dependency. In this movie, the lovers display a wide range of emotion that is certainly not unheard of among intense relationships and passionate people. Once they've peaked emotionally and sexually, partners begin to make negative associations about their lives and their current other, and eventually habit, boredom, and general resentment sink in. But the question is, is a love that has ever burned that intensely ever able to completely exhonerate itself? One passionate feeling takes over for another, and the vicious love/hate cycle begins - that's when sometimes it seems better to feel pain than nothing at all.

Self-esteem issues, sadism/masochism, complacency and codependency permeate the relationships in this movie. I think it's an excellent commentary on modern relationships, and definately worth watching for the performances, the ride, and the ending.",1093824000,2,1164,5.360655737704918

I think this movie is an absolute gem.  First off, taking a step back, this movie isn't about two good people that meet and fall in love.  I believe this movie is about what happens when two very base, very bored, and largely devoid of virtue collide.  It's about the danger in irrational immoral entanglement (again, this is just my opinion).  You see, the sex scenes (some of them anyway) are meant to be laughable.  These two hit bottom together and reach (what Peter Coyote, the male partner calls) ""sexual bankruptcy""....right in front of your eyes, they get slaughtered by their own insane urges!  Brilliant, strange, interesting, depressing, important (especially if you're prone to confuse urges with love).
Peter Coyote gives an amazing performance, Polanski offered up his own wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) as the temptress (c'mon, you've got to give him at least one star for having enough love for this film to direct his own wife through sex scenes).
If you haven't seen Bitter Moon, don't miss this film.  I think it raises important questions and warnings about certain popular behavior (or at least tendencies) in relationships.  All the while being entertaining, and at times utterly shocking.

755044,1,6303914985,"I admire director/actor Roman Polanski very much; not only because he can be a consumate filmaker and has made some of the more interesting films of the late 20th. Century, but also because he has managed to surive the loss of his family to the Nazi gas chambers, the loss of his pregnant wife to the Manson lunatics as well as many other problems.
""Bitter Moon"", in my opinion, has no redemming features whatsoever. If I didn't know that Polanski was involved I never would have believed it. The script is trite, corny and shallow. The acting performances, without exception, are utterly pedestrian and completely unbelievable.
In case anyone believes that my distaste for ""bitter Moon"" stems from its sexual or violent content let me assure you that is certainly not the case. I did, however, find the sexual content to be absolutely laughable. I am a great fan of intricate and thoughtful movies; some of my favourite directors are Atom Egoyan, Krystof Kiewslowski, David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, Akira Kurosawa and, indeed, Roman Polanski.
However intricate, deep, simple or spectacular a film may be, it must be engaging. In my opinion, ""Bitter Moon"" is a laborious and boring film. I wouldn't be surprised if Polanski wishes he had never made it.",1079740800,8,1286,4.986046511627907
755045,4,6303914985,"Bitter Moon is surely not for everyone. It's one of Polanski's audacious ones -- he seemed to be far beyond concern over matters of taste. And Emmanuelle Seigner -- easily the pivot of this bizarre tale -- never seemed miscast in a role as a voracious seductress with black widow tendencies, whose amusement is to blind men in the headlights of her sexuality, and step on the gas.
The word ""promiscuous"" was coined to describe films like this. Like all stories dealing with the extremes of sex, it arrives at moments when we can barely prevent ourselves from laughing (e.g., S&M combines humorless scenarios with absurd choreography.)
It is the easiest thing in the world to criticize movies like Bitter Moonshaking one's head wearily and complaining about the director's zany imagination. And of course a lot of it is wretched excess.
But Polanski directs it without compromise or apology, and it's a funny thing how so many reviewers may condescend to it, but while they're watching it you could hear a pin drop.

The entire formula plays out as a man's sexual fantasy and cynical POV that initial perfect love is necessarily obsessive and therefore has to run dry, perhaps abruptly, like switching off a lightbulb (seems a less than mature POV).  The object of desire is the director's real-life wife, so that actually tells us more about him (the director) than it lends any real-life credibility to the proceedings.  Hugh Grant gives a restrained yet appropriately edgy performance, the best in the film, though the leading lady is appropriate lovely, though never comes off as hard-edged as she needs to be, for the latter scenes.  Coyote is irritating like the Gollum character.  If you like this type of movie ordinarily, I would recommend the more extreme COMFORT OF STRANGERS which takes place in Venice; otherwise rent this movie first, rather than risk wasting your money on a purchase.",1074902400,,1006,4.928994082840236

The director's searing, sardonic tale of sexual perversity, jealousy and betrayal could have been a withering tale; instead, in Polanski's skilled hands, disillusionment proves subordinate to humor - moral judgmentalism gives way to merriment - at least on the part of this viewer.  Taken literally (or autobiographically), of course ""Moon"" is distressing.  If the storied director meant this treatise as a rational discourse on human sexuality, then it's as depressing in its own way as ""Humanae Vitae"" was decades earlier.  At face value, both documents convey the same message:  Beware the surrender of sex, because disaster will ensue.  But Pope Paul wasn't funny - Polanski is exceedingly funny.  The late pontiff purported moral absolutism - the Polish director claims no such omnipotence.  My delight in this film was significant, exuding as it did from someone whose former rigidity was so obtuse that patent leather shoes were anathema.  And when you've been in the psychic equivalent of a five-year labor, Polanski's intelligence and humor were akin to manna from the gods.  Mercifully, those bleak days are now a thing of the past.....recovery was mine at last....but I have never forgotten my uproarious laughter in a small, darkened theatre in St. Louis nearly a decade ago.

There is a reason (while a morally questionable one) that Oscar continues to tell Nigel about how he and his wife met and the culmination of their relationship...But you must watch the film to find out Oscar's hidden agenda...
Theatrically released back in 1992 in Europe and neglected here in the States, Bitter Moon made it to vhs in 1994. Hugh Grant may seem a bit ill at ease in his role as a dorky husband. But then again, this character role would be a prelude to the many other somewhat comical characters he would portray in later films. Kristin Scott-Thomas plays Fiona, the savvy and sophisticated wife on this anniversary cruise with Nigel. She longs for true romance and passion and the possibility of having children some day. French actress/model and Roman Polanski's wife in real life, Emmanuelle Seigner steals a lot of scenes with her brand of sizzling beauty as Mimi (the film's stereotypical French seductress).Her acting is a bit limited at times...but who cares. Peter Coyote is witty and clever as a hard edged and cynical author who has a hidden agenda in the grand scheme of the story as it unfolds ! ...The climax of the film is quite an eye opener !
I have waited for years for this Polanski directed vhs title to make it onto the dvd format...It finally has. The only disappointment is the lack of a 5.1 Dolby Digital surround soundtrack(only 2.0 is available).However, I was able to extract a rear surround channel by Pro-Logic processing in my receiver(remember Pro-Logic?).Though the film itself is more dialogue than special effects, there is no excuse. With the dvd format a little over half a decade old, all movie titles should be mastered or re-mastered in the full digital surround system. No questions asked or anything spared. The studios or sound engineers should just do it !Picture quality is as good as it gets for this type of film. Colors are natural,reds don't bleed. There isn't any exaggerated or vibrant coloring as on some releases. There is a bit of film grain (that's to be expected) but not enough to distract. Any other visual digital artifacts are minimal. Beyond this small gripe this film is provocative and richly steeped in various scenes with dark twisted humor. But beware; the humor only goes so far and then drama is entertwined...
While this is NOT a film for a young audience, adults will appreciate the dark natured humor intermingled with scenes containing adult material...This is very much a film directed in pure Roman Polanski style. The excitement found in Polanski's directing is his unpredictability in whre he is going to take the audience !

Two couples: first -Grant & Thomas- who have nothing to say to each other (and try to hide their growing separation going on a cruise); the second -Coyote and Seigner- who have already gone through the peaks of love, desire, disappointment, separation, hate, contempt (and live stuck to each other).
This is the premisse: two very different couples on different stages of their relationships.
The story is told (Coyote tells his story to Grant) in flashback and menages to affect the present relationship between Grant and his wife.
Polanski, without moralism or any judgemental objective, tell the story of how feelings can be transformed into many other things. How people can go over the top with what they feel.
By the time the film opened, some people said it was voyeuristic and exploitive. I don't agree with that. I think this film tells an adult and powerful story about Men, Women, their excesses and the pain they can cause. As you may imagine, the film, sometimes, gets violent and some sex scenes are quite bold (without being either vulgar nor porno-chic). To me, everything is in the right place.
I loved the ending. It was tragic and (yet) full of hope. The cinematography (as in all Polanski films) is great. The music by Vangelis is also great (I loved the scene when Coyote sends Seigner away). This film is obviously a work by a master storyteller/filmmaker. All the actors are peerless.
If only James Cameron had a story like this in front of his Titanic backdrop!! -(laughs)

755092,4,6303914985,"This really is a very unusual film, structurally and in its subject matter. The majority of the action takes place in flashback, with Peter Coyote's crippled writer relating tales of his love/lust affair with the stunning Emmanuelle Seigner to a hooray Henry played, surprise, surprise by Hugh Grant. In fairness to Grant his performance as Nigel is good, and this is before his role in Four Weddings And A Funeral catapulted him to stardom and eventual typecasting. Grant's reactions to Coyote's tales of sexual perversity, obsession, domination and cruelty serve as a comic foil to the rather heavy tone of the rest of the movie, preventing it becoming too dark.
There are a few sexually explicit moments but they do not dominate the movie, which is more psychological and intelligent than that. One aspect which was not touched upon in the film was the possibility that the writer could be making most of it up - are these just his fantasies or did it all really happen? The structure makes it look as though you are watching two movies, one set in Paris, and the other aboard a boat. Indeed there were two separate crews, and Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas are only ever seen on board the ship., as are the other star names, Victor Bannerjee and Stockard Channing. It looks almost as though director Roman Polanski has made a very black film with the fairly unknown Coyote and Polanski's wife Seigner, then in order to sell the thing to Britain and America has tacked on a framing device with some well known actors in it.
Special mention must go to the movie's music, from Vangelis's incidentals to Sam Brown's superb Stop and other 1980s hits, the film exudes good taste. There are a couple of re-recorded hits, but they are done so well I didn't notice until I saw the credits.
The performances are good, the action convinces (Despite a bad model shot of the liner in a storm - it seems really small as the water has not been scaled properly), and you are left with combined feelings of fascination and disgust. This is not for the faint hearted, but enjoyable and thought provoking if you are prepared to suspend your moral judgement for a couple of hours.",1046304000,6,2164,4.68241469816273

755094,5,6303914985,"The renowned and legendary director Roman Polanski, has hit a pinnacle of originality with this tragically funny, dark humored sex tale. ""Bitter Moon"" is a uniquely one of a kind outing that you can't compare to ANY other film.

While on a cruise to put some sparks back into a troubled marriage, Nigel(Hugh Grant) and his wife Fiona, played by Kristen Scott Thomas (4 Weddings & a Funeral, also with Grant) meet Oscar (Peter Coyote) paralyzed from the waist down in a wheelchair, and his unexpectedly beautiful sexpot wife Mimi(Emanuelle Seigner).

Oscar senses a voyueristic listener in Nigel after taking note of the obvious attraction he has for his wife.  Oscar invites Nigel to join him on board as he weaves the fairy tale start of how such an unlikely couple came to be.  While we listen and watch in flashback, Oscar spins tales of obsession at first sight, an affair of wild passionate lust, a turn to kinkiness followed by boredom, and last but far from least, a two-fold twist of power within the relationship that changes everything.

Peter Coyote  plays his role as Oscar the narrator, in a wonderfully slimy and of course ""bitter"" way.  It's hard to decide if you hate him,  feel sorry for him, or a bit of both.  Hugh Grant is suitably uptight in the proper British stereotype, as Nigel.  While he claims to be thoroughly offended by Oscar's rantings,  his ""virgin"" ears keep begging for more of the same.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, the proper English wife of Grant's Nigel.  Up until the ""bitter"" end, she is disgusted and suspicious that her husband is having an affair with Mimi, whom Nigel obviously finds to be a fascinating and mysterious creature indeed.  Apparently, he's not the only one, as you'll see. Oscar dangles her like bait, and Nigel is hooked.  As each intallment of Oscars story is told, Nigel becomes more and more desperate to uncover the mystery. Oscar relishes the sadistic hold he has on Nigels attention. He is like a drug dealer doling out doses of Mimi to an increasingly desperate imagination.

Seigner, a distinctive beauty, who happens to be Polanski's wife, is almost unrecognizable from when she appeared in Polanski's ""Frantic.""  Compared to the skinny waif she'd been then, she is definitely and appropriately voluptuous here. A few extra pounds never looked so good, or worked so well. The role of Mimi calls for a total woman with femme fatale curves.  When you view this film for yourself, you will understand what I mean.

One thing is for certain, with ""Bitter Moon"" you feel like YOU'VE been in Nigel's shoes along with him.  You will also relate to Nigel because this film will most likely shock, perhaps offend as well too, but like Nigel, you WILL keep coming back for more.",1011139200,10,2742,4.781316348195329

Love, hate, bitterness and laughter co-exist in this odd tale fileld with excellent character studies.  The movie can be very romantic at times. The story of the meeting of the Peter Coyote and Emanuelle Seigner characters is simple, engaging and beleivable.  The poignant and subtle score by Vangelis that accents the deeper scenes is one of his best-and most overlooked.  Most appreciate the film for its - justly praised - eroticism.  I rather enjoyed the study of human failure, of the symbiosis of love and hate that can exist in passion and both repressed and exuberant sexuality.

755148,4,6303914985,"This is a film which seems to attempt to explore the darker side of love (lust?). Peter Coyote is the self-pitying wheelchair bound Oscar, who decides to share a ghastly story involving sex, jealousy, lust and humiliaton with ultra straight Nigel (Hugh Grant). Oscar's real motive for telling Nigel this bizarre storyis never clearly defined, perhaps whem you watch it you should make up your own mind. Does he tell it for attention? He seems to get a kick out of shocking Nigel.
  If you're a fan of Polanski, not only will you find this film entertaining you're bound to notice the obvious Polanski trademarks found in his films. There is the restricted claustrophobic settings, the power to hurt and humiliate, the victim and the persecuter. And, of course, there is violence.
  However, try not to read too much of Polanski's own real life experiences in this film. People often fantasize about certain things, particularly of a sexual nature. Bitter Moon merely tries to see where some fantasies will take you. Will you be bathed in happiness for all time? Or are you paving your own private road to hell?

755149,1,6303914985,"I like films which are sexy and have a cruel wit about them.  But unfortunately for me I totally missed the humor in the film which must have been blacker than black. Mostly what I saw was a couple engaged in bitter acts of mental and physical cruelty. This is Hugh Grant before he became the clumsy, good natured but self deprecating actor most people associate him with in Sense and Sensibilities and Notting Hill. The whole experience for me was unpleasant and I actually stepped out of the theater for a few minutes as I really wasn't enjoying myself. Roman Polansky has had a hard life. His mother and father were imprisoned in a concentration camp, (his mother died there) and his wife Sharon Tate was cut open by Charles Manson's gang.  Its not hard to see why his films typically reflect a debauched and unpleasant view of love sex and relationships. What should have been pleasant in his life was turned perverse. With the exception of Rosemary's Baby, I haven't enjoyed much of the content of his films. Rosemary's Baby works in part because Rosemary is a nice counterpoint whom the audience can relate to. Bitter Moon lacks that sympathetic element.
  I have good friends who enjoy films like Penny's from Heaven, War of the Roses and The Cook the Wife the Thief and her Lover that are slow paced and feature people who callously afflict one another with the most unkind of abuses.

One can write about this film a lot, but I will concentrate on what makes you watch it for the second, third, fourth time. It is a movie about Passion, about the time in a relationship when there is no point of return, about when love and hate are one deep feeling, which is called Passion. The story is not what is the most interesting here, the characters are. All four are brilliantly casted by Roman Polanski. Two girls show two totally different sexualities: one open, aggressive (Emmanuelle Seigner) and the other (Kristine Scott Thomas)- hidden, but it's like a volcano inside a sleeping mountain. When Seigner pours milk over herself during usual breakfast it's one of the most exciting moments in cinema, forget ""9  weeks"". Two male characters also oppose one another: Peter Coyote, a-never-will-be-Scott-Fitzgerald, who wants to reach an end in everything, whatever it will bring to him; and Hugh Grant, an emotional coward afraid of anything connected to deep feelings.

755152,4,6303914985,"""I was looking at the gates of heaven embodied in the female form"" says the bitter and wheelchair bound Oscar(Peter Cayote) of his wife Mimi(Emmanuelle Siegner). The reluctant listener is Nigel(Hugh Grant), a man most people would politely refer to as a bookish English type, but would more honestly label him a square. They are all travelling on a luxurious Ocean liner where Nigel and his appropriately uptight wife Fiona(Kristen Scott Thomas) are headed for India where they hope to rekindle their romance after six years of marriage. As for Oscar and Mimi, well they're headed ""much much further"". The stage is set for Roman Polanski's risque and lurid melodrama which runs the risk of being taken seriously. Bitter Moon is infact a sophisticated joke by a frustrated autuer.
  It all starts when Nigel wonders into the ship's lounge, sees the voluptuous Mimi dancing like the siren that she is, and is immediately smitten. Offscreen Mimi's bitter husband, Oscar observes the lust his wife has stirred in the Brit. A little later Nigel is cornered by Oscar and is compelled (by Oscar's nagging and his own unacknowledged voyueristic desires) to listen to their story. Oscar narrates, and Polanski obliges with flashbacks to Paris where Oscar first met his future wife. We learn that Oscar was a frustrated and unpublished writer, and in his account of a relationship that went from bliss to boredom to sadism and finally vengeance, there is that wretched stench of those trashy romance novels. Aside from the aforementioned quote, he says of his first impression of her: ""She had a mix of sexual maturity and childish naivete"". When their relationship had lost its spark, he says: ""Our credit was running out, we were headed for sexual bankruptcy"". When he finally gives up on their relationship and decides to indulge in heedless promiscuity, he says:""Everytime I look into one woman's eyes I see reflections of the next"". Given the success of the likes of Danielle Steel, its actually surprising that this guy was never published.  Back on the Ocean liner, a less interesting story of the sexual awakening of the clueless English couple is told in parallel to the Paris story. But Grant plays Nigel as completely clueless, so Oscar's manupilation of him is never that interesting. I found myself wishing Polanski would get back to the flashbacks. It is there that his intentions are slowly revealed.
  I have read reviews of Bitter Moon calling it ""a story of erotic obsession"" and things of that nature. And Polanski, with the aid of Tonino Delli Colli's elegant cinematography and Vengalis's sensuous score, goes to great lengths to make Bitter Moon look like a serious film about obsession and dependance, but Cayote's narration and the absurdly graphic sex scenes give him away. As this lurid story progresses, the vein of black comedy hinted at in the beginning gets thicker. The rabbit is finally out of that hat in a hysterical S&M scene involving a pig mask that, unfortunately, can never be quoted from here. It is to Polanski's great credit that he never winks, never acknowledges the absurdity of his film.
  Roman Polanski's films have always been very personal. He has alienated many critics by repeatedly casting his wife(wives)in his films. There is actually a scene in Bitter Moon where Cayote describes some preverse S&M he and Mimi had engaged in(thankfully left to viewer's imagination), and the stunned Nigel barks at him ""For God's sake man."" An intersting way to look at Bitter Moon is to think of the Cayote character as a stand in for Polanski, and Nigel as the shocked critics yelling ""For God's sake man."" Think about it, Oscar is so obsessed with Seigner/Mimi that he is willing to endure her torturing him, Polanski is so obsessed with Seigner that he is willing to make a silly melodrama such as Bitter Moon starring her. But unlike Oscar, Polanski has the intelligence to standback and find the whole thing funny. Bittermoon is a ridiculous film, but it has a perverse sense of humour that makes it special.",969580800,,4043,4.936764705882353
755153,4,6303914985,"Roman Polanski has never been accused of being a timid filmmaker.  Over  the years, his many movies have been distinguished by their potent subject  matter and sure-handed direction.  They are certainly not for everyone's  taste, but those who like Polanski films tend to like them very much  indeed.  Bitter Moon is no different.  It is one of the most frank and  deliciously outrageous films I have seen in a long time.
The story begins  with a very staid and proper British couple on an ocean voyage.  Nigel and  Fiona (Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott-Thomas) are hoping to rekindle the  faint spark of romance that is left in their marriage.  What they get  instead is something much more than they bargained for.
Almost  immediately, they meet Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner), a seductive French femme  fatale, and her crippled husband Oscar (Peter Coyote), a failed American  writer.  Oscar knows that Nigel desires Mimi and he is willing to  accommodate him, but first Nigel must listen to the sordid story of their  life together.
I don't want to give away too many of the details, for the  shock of hearing their tale is the best part of the film.  It is, at  various turns, erotic, outrageous, outlandish, hilarious, titillating and  unbelievable.  What it is certainly not is boring.  As we peek in on their  bizarre sex life, first stimulated, then horrified, we are never quite sure  what is true and what is fantasy.  Against his better judgment, Nigel finds  himself drawn into their twisted, little world and the results do not  disappoint.
It seems that it always takes a European director to make a  film such as this one.  Americans are far too timid about sexuality to deal  with it in an frank and adult manner.  You can count on Polanski or Paul  Verhoeven or Bertrand Blier to make a film like ""Bitter Moon.""  But what about Spielberg or Scorsese or Coppola?  Never.  When it comes to  films involving violence, American directors can be as bold and explicit as  one could ever desire.  In stories involving eroticism and sensuality,  however, they are sadly lacking.
Due to some regrettable incidents in  Polanski's past, his films seldom get the respect they deserve in this  country.  That is unfortunate because his work is generally superb.  His  1988 thriller ""Frantic,"" starring Harrison Ford, remains one of  the best, most unappreciated films of recent years.  ""Bitter  Moon"" was first released in Europe in 1992, but it took two years for  it to finally be shown in America.  Anyone who ignores this one, though,  will be missing a damn fine film.",959212800,97,2571,4.8399071925754065
755154,4,6303914985,"I first saw this film years ago, and was immediately amazed at not only it's intensity, but where it deliberately dared to go, both with its storyline and dialogue.  When I saw it again years later, I was even more  impressed than previously thought.  At it's essence, the movie is a love  story, set in Paris, between Oscar (Peter Coyote) and Mimi, played by the  stunningly beautifull Emmanuelle Seigner.  Yet this ititial passion,  escalates to a such a lust, that any true feelings they have for each other  are overwhelmed by the desire to repeat that initial exeburance.  Soon  Oscar gets bored with the isolation that Mimi brings, and begins to resent  their relationship.  While Mimi, despite her threats to the contrary, can  no longer live without Oscar, having become too drained emotionally to find  love outside of their now passionless affair.  What begins next, is the  true mettle of this film, and takes it on a different course, one filled  with chauvanistic cruelty, and female revenge.
All the while, this  story is not being played out in real time, but retold, on a cruise ship,  to stodgy British pip Hugh Grant, whose uneasiness during the more absurdly  erotic scenes extends to the viewer as well.  Grant, is on his honeymoon,  with his wife Fiona, but due to his immediate attraction to Mimi, spends  his days not with his wife, but in the cabin of Oscar.  It is there, where  he listens, like a voyeur, to the story of Oscar and Mimi in an effort to  learn more about his new object of desire, and to parlay that into getting  her into bed.  What culminates at the end is both shocking and sad, and yet  a resolution to the extreme passions of all involved.

She (Emmanuelle Seigner) is a beautiful innocent young French dancer (although she currently works as a waitress) Both meet in Paris by chance. They (Kristin Scott-Thomas and Hugh Grant) are a conventional British couple who also meet the others by chance and are just bystanders, spectators of the final act of the tragedy.
The apparently romantic and naive love story drifts into the bizarre depths of the human soul and ends in tragedy. She genuinely falls in love with him, although it is a sick and obsessive kind of love, more like a drug addiction. He does not. He only craves for her sexually. She is like a sex goddess to him, the perfect incarnation of female sexuality. From a personal point of view, he is a despicable and pathetic sort of human being, while one is truly moved to feel compassion for her. He destroys her. Se destroys him. They actually destroy themselves, he (paraphrasing William Blake) by trying to reach the palace of wisdom through sexual excess, and she by clinging desperately to an emotional addiction. The end is not surprising, quite predictable, like a modern Greek tragedy, although there is no deus ex machina. The film raises many questions that may not have an answer.

Despite being disturbing, it is very realistic - this is a cautionary tale about what can happen when people take a very commonly occurring love story to the extremes. The common situation is when a man gets initially infatuated with a woman but after exploring all the physical and purely emotional highs gets bored and cold. It happens quite often and extremely hard for a woman to understand such a sudden change. She does not get that the man never cared about her as a person and never bothered to learn about her (not saying men are not capable of it, just that often they pursue purely physical attractions). Not only the woman clings to the hope that ""he'll come around"" but she is also craving the high that she herself experienced while being initially treated as a ""goddess"". Combine two artistic temperaments of the main characters, one of which is a cynical middle age man frustrated by lack of professional success and another is an inexperienced young girl and voila - you have a twisted tragedy on your hands!
