4229078,5,B003YGC7VM,"This is one of the most engaging and interesting documentaries of John Lennon I've seen. This A&E documentary explores Lennon and his wife Yoko's life in New York and his ""lost weekend"" in L.A. This is a great watch for anyone who loves Lennon, or even the Beatles.",1292112000,6,265,4.541666666666667

4229080,4,B003YGC7VM,"I DVR'd this documentary the other night while I was doing my pre-thanksgiving cooking.
On thanksgiving day, after all the cooking was done and the family was engorged with food,
I stole away upstairs to watch this from my recliner and though it didn't really hit on many
things that I didn't already know about Lennon during this period, the final decade of his life,
I did think it was done well and yes, I would and will buy it for my collection.
I just liked John Lennon's whole vibe and what he stood for in his life.
The other reviewers have already articulated alot of the particulars, so I kept mine
straight to the point! (-:",1290729600,14,634,4.427350427350428
4229081,4,B003YGC7VM,"Here's a documentary that exclusively chronicles John's post-Imagine life which, until now, seemed to be the most glaringly overlooked era of his existence on film. There's footage from previous documentary sources, but it's necessary in tracing John's story moving from England in August 1971 to New York City. John's life during this nine-year period is addressed seriously and intelligently and is spiced with interviews from those that knew him best at that time.

This invites the audience to contemplate his struggles through his political regime. His agenda inclines him into staging concerts for humanitarian issues: the ""Ten For Two Concert"" in 1971 and the ""One To One Concert"" in 1972. And it's in this year that John and Yoko are being blacklisted by the Nixon Administration and the FBI for the subversive nature of their political views. The deportation process is well outlined here. What makes this part of his story so incredible is that his influence is so strong that he's able to rankle the sensibilities of the U.S. officials in power for the next few years. Topping all this is a pointed interview with Yoko indicating that the downward spiral in their marriage leading to their eventual separation germinated on the evening that Nixon defeated George McGovern.

The next year and a half will show John and Yoko coming to terms with their separation. Producer Jack Douglas provides fascinating tidbits of John's popcraft as he explains John's compositional and lyrical techniques during the making of ""Mind Games"".  There's fine footage on that evening at Elton John's Madison Square Garden performance when the reconciliation between John and Yoko gets underway.

The film essays the spirit that, in the last five years of John's life, he actually has a sense of belonging - particularly telling once Sean is born.  It's made more clear that by 1980, John had come full circle and he seemed revitalized in making interesting music again while securing his family life. Although this omits interviews with Julian Lennon and Sean Lennon, the value of this film is that it offers a display of the charismatic hold that John exerts on his fanbase well past that fateful night. A worthy addition to what may be a much-shared knowledge.",1290556800,48,2253,5.061994609164421
4229082,4,B003YGC7VM,"Of all the important musicians in the last century, it's pretty easy to see that John Lennon stands out for his influence on music, pop culture, and society in general. Lennon himself - his music and activism - along with their effects on the world, have been well documented in countless short and feature-length documentaries. Now American Masters - ""an ongoing series of award-winning primetime specials examining the lives, works, and creative processes of our most outstanding cultural artists"" - takes on the subject of John Lennon and his time in New York City. The series has featured Andy Warhol, Charlie Chaplin, and Paul Simon, among others.

This Lennon profile is special in that it's not a documentary about his entire life, but as the title suggests, focuses on his time in New York City with Yoko Ono, using numerous interviews with friends and bandmates along with never before-released in-studio recordings of Lennon. This is a documentary that assumes you already know quite a bit about Lennon and know why his time in New York is important and then goes on to both explain why this is true and give you a behind the scenes look at his life at this time. Without glossing over any of the rough patches (including the hiatus John and Yoko took and his subsequent time in Los Angeles), writer and director Michael Epstein gives audiences a true portrait of the legendary musician and activist as seen through the eyes of those around him (including Yoko Ono) and captured in in-studio recording sessions.

The film is thoroughly engaging, though not always structurally clear. Epstein begins with the story of Lennon as an immigrant, looking to make New York City his home though the United States government (the Nixon administration to be more specific) is seeking to get him deported for his various activist causes. This is an intriguing theme, and we're privy to many of those around him discussing being followed and the FBI keeping records on them, but this storyline builds quickly and then goes on the backburner for over an hour before reappearing briefly at the very end. It's an incredible part of Lennon's story and well presented, but Epstein plays up Lennon's immigration status so much in the opening that I always felt like I was waiting for that piece of the story to come back into play. The best parts of the film are the clips of Lennon in the studio and those around him discussing his studio style. Listening to Lennon in the studio is even more fascinating than you might suspect.

The portion of the film (near the end) that deals with John's time after mending ties with Yoko, the birth of his son Sean, and the work on his last album is especially touching. As with any Lennon documentary, the ending left me wishing that there was a documentary about some alternate universe where Lennon was still alive so that the ending didn't have to be so sad.",1289952000,94,2893,4.782
4229083,5,B003YGC7VM,"I've only gotten to see part of this new documentary, but knowing that A&E always does everything so well, I'm looking forward to watching the entire presentation. I'm sure that there will be some terrific bonus features.

I do feel as if you won't learn anything new, had you seen all the other documentaries about Lennon's murder or times in New York. But quality of the film is great. I had digital copy, but I wanted a physical copy so it's worth the buy in any format. The only sad part is that, it does have an ending, December 8th 1980.",1415664000,,498,4.03030303030303

4229147,5,B003YGC7VM,"I am a Beatles fan who grew up listening to them.  I have admired John Lennon for a long time, but never knew much about him, other than his peace activism.  Yoko Ono has let us in on a very private part of her life with John, including their troubled times.  I admired that the focus of this film was on a part of John's life; solo music career and fatherhood and his vast enjoyment of both.

Vendor does what customer expects. Sends the product as advertised,
it is not damaged. It is securely packaged.
Qoute from Ralph Waldo Emerson:
""Life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy"".
That one can take the time to write, and not merely 'text', which is short on courtesy and emotion
and respect for the recipient, is what use to be. Writing means that one can transmit substantive thought.
Cutting back on courtesy has its parallel failings in all matters of civilized society, and downgrades that which we call 'society'.
Start with education, look at it, and respect what it does for the individual, and for society.",1390780800,,692,4.923076923076923
4229149,4,B003YGC7VM,"Pretty interesting. Maybe too much information for the newcomer to Lennon or the BeaTles. Being a child of that era, I loved this thing.

Don't expect a whole lot of music. Unfortunately, this isn't really about that. Probably something to do with performance rights.

Still, it's pretty interesting. I'm not a fan of long-winded reviews. If you liked Lennon, this is a nice thing to watch. Once. If you don't  give a crap about him, skip it.

The Blu-Ray transfer is as good as documentary gets. Looks GREAT!

If you want to know more about the man, get it. If it doesn't matter to you, don't. That's really all it comes down to. I loved it!",1385942400,2,642,4.5

4229185,1,B003YGC7VM,Its an honest look at lennon from this time- I don't think a non Yoko approved Biopic would be any better- its not like John is protrayed as some kind of saint. About the only odd thing is the complete absence of  material from the making of Imagine. never the less if your interested in what was happening to this person at that time this is a good referance. 1 star because Im not into the whole star system but you Have to choose a number of stars to write a review.,1320710400,3,469,4.0978260869565215

4229187,4,B003YGC7VM,Do you ever have a song and want to know how it came to be? I never knew some intimate details regarding John and Yoko's relationship and this documentary opens the door to a fascinating story of John Lennon's finest music. There were a couple of songs that the acoustic like Make Love Not War in my opinion would have been an added feature to his Greatest Hits Album. The beauty and tragedy of his music is during a separation period between John and Yoko and he finds his soul singing to the love of his life asking for forgiveness. Furthermore Yoko's veneer breaks a little in heartfelt plea upon his death. Jealous Guy which I have been mixed about for quite some time became one of my favorites due to this documentary.,1315612800,,724,4.451127819548872

4229189,5,B003YGC7VM,"I have been a big Beatles fan since I sat cross-legged on the floor in front of a colour TV in 1964* and saw then for the first time.

As I grew up my tastes changed and I became more focused on John Lennon. His music and his art.

I thought that I had seen and heard everything about his life. From the other Beatles, record producers, family insiders, authors, fellow musicians and even from John himself.

This documentary gave me some insights into the human being I never had seen before. I watched this movie with fascination despite knowing everything about his music and career.

I will tell you candidly that I am also a Yoko Ono fan. If you are not you might be a little put off by the focus given to Yoko's work and life.

But I think this documentary, especially the studio outtakes and John's own words about his life, will give even the oldest fans enjoyment.

Cheers and Peace.

4229190,4,B003YGC7VM,"This is the Lennon documentary that they should have made a long time ago. Great job! This of course was ok'd by Yoko because she knew that Imagine was not that good. Her hiring of Director writer Michael Epstein is welcoming. The intent on telling as close to an accurate background of the solo music years and the main reason of why their relationship failed in the early 70's is heartfelt- you feel empathy and understanding towards Yokos decision to kick Lennon out. She's no slouch that woman. My only problem is the interview with Elliot Mintz,he annoys me. I don't believe for one second he had a personal ""friendship"" with JL,more of an aquaintence and stoolie for Yoko that grew stronger over the years to give the ""perception"" that he was JL's friend. Im sure JL was nice to him because Yoko told him to be nice and he was sometimes the middleman in communicating between the couple when they were seperated. Im sure he's a very loyal protecting employee and Yoko gives him interview face time to pump his ""business"".Yoko is very loyal,and talented! John was right i guess. Seeing the interview w Jack Douglas who was shafted by Yoko after Double Fantasy was a welcomed sight-glad to see they patched things up. Couldn't be a nicer guy. Andy Newmark ,Tony levin and Hugh McCraken all amazing musicians, Im sure were somewhat reluctant to speak on JL.But the stories they told were priceless. I agree with the other reviewers that you wanted more...and then all that sadness. I was in NYC that night driving home. NOTE: I hope the upcoming Harrison documentary by Martin Scorcese is not like Imagine,but rather another great insightful and more in-depth story then the ""usual"" ""safe"" one the Beatles families continue to sometimes let us in on. There's more story to this Greek drama folks. Read ""Here,There and Evrywhere"" by Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick for more insight of this great,great band. And somebody tell Paul to do some album shows rather then the same songs over and over. Maybe add some horns or strings. Forget the samples..nuff said",1310428800,2,2059,4.802816901408451
4229191,4,B003YGC7VM,"While it goes over a lot of ground already covered in numerous other documentaries, LENNONYC has one major advantage.  It doesn't just talk about John the activist, John the iconoclast, John the reformed philanderer and John the family man, but most importantly, John the musician.  The film is at its best when focussing on that aspect on John's life.

Naturally, the film has to deal with stories previously told, such as John's flirtation with the yippie movement and problems with immigration and the FBI.  Also, despite being primarily about John's love affair with New York, the film gives just as much time to the ""lost weekend"" period in Los Angeles, much of which has been gone over before.

Many of the usual suspects are interviewed, including Elliot Mintz, May Pang and the ubiquitous Geraldo Rivera but things get interesting when they talk to the musicians who played with John through the 70s.  Even when it's Jim Keltner talking about John's drinking in LA, or members of Elephant's Memory talking about having their 'phones tapped too, it brings a perspective that previous films haven't shown.  Producer Jack Douglas and Yoko's recollections of what they did on the evenings following John's death is particularly moving.

The film could stand to be about twenty minutes shorter but it does bring a new angle to the story of Lennon in the US, from participants who aren't usually heard.

Highlight: Recollections from musicians about making the albums and studio banter.

4229202,5,B003YGC7VM,"[LENNONYC - (2010) - approx. 115 min. - fullscreen presentation - written and directed by Michael Epstein] A highly interesting and reverential documentary detailing Lennon's year's in America - no Beatlemania, no Fab Four, no childhood pics, art school or 'Cavern days' rehashing, no speculation or innuendo and, no sappy emotional brouhaha elevating Lennon to Godlike status. Here we are treated to hearing about  the man who had it all but was bored, tired and weary of London, seeking the other modern-day 'Rome', New York, and feeling extremely at home there in his own words. We get to hear about some lesser-known facets of his life in NYC, from those who knew him well - long-time friend and photographer Bob Gruen, recording engineer and producer Roy Cicala, the guys in Elephant's Memory, whose band he fell into after producing their album for Apple records, a surprisingly direct and emotional Yoko, producer Jack Douglas ('Double Fantasy'), and bandmates Klaus Voorman, Andy Newmark and Jim Keltner, among others. We hear about his weaknesses as a man as well as his strengths as a composer, artist and human being.

 It sheds more light on this chapter in John's life than any video representation that preceded it. There's the induction and swift exit into the civil rights revolts spearheaded by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, the 'Free John Sinclair' rally (whose audio and video have finally been remastered), the appearance with Elton at Madison Square Garden in '75, the years fighting deportation, the hatred Nixon and Hoover had for him in these deportation nightmares (and vice-versa), his 'lost weeks' in L.A. with Harry Nillson, Keith Moon, Ringo and Paul McCartney, previously unheard studio versions and rehearsals, musical cues from John, comments, banter, arguments and screaming matches with Phil Spector, self-imposed retirement and life as a father and househusband with infant Sean, and the return to the Record Plant to resume his career, criminally cut-short by his assassination in 1980 on his 40th birthday. (Thankfully, not much time is spent dwelling on this tragedy).

What sets this apart from your typical documentary are the graphic visuals, photos, and dialogue spread out on the screen over the photographic images like Ralph Steadman's H.S.T. verbal artillery or 'Yellow Submarine' speech splattering, lending movement to what would otherwise be much more static and sedate. It flows along so well that it seems the ending comes too soon, and that can't be a bad thing in a documentary, now can it? No matter how many hours of video you have of Lennon and the Beatles, this dvd brings something different and welcome to the table. Commemorating the final decade in the life of one of the 20th Century's most influential and uniquely important figures, it proves that even today, Lennon remains relevant and will be forever missed, though with us always.

4229204,4,B003YGC7VM,"Wonder what a non-Yoko approved John-bio would look like

I think a lot of Yoko's stuff is terrific. I just don't think it's terrific in alternation with John's stuff. I find that John's stuff sounds much better when alternated with the other solo Beatles. MUCH BETTER.

And I believe that a John film-bio doesn't have to be so Yoko-centric. Even Elton John gets roped into declaring that Lennon's Madison Square Garden appearance on Thankgiving Day 1974 marked the end of John's May Pang affair and the renewal of John and Yoko's marriage. It did no such thing. For two additional months John and May's torrid affair continned apace. Many memorably torrid love affairs are shorter-lived start-to-finish than that. Yoko had such a firm hold on John by early February 1975 that John and May came within a whisker of buying a house together. They would have, but Yoko finally panicked and reeled John back in to the Dakota before John and May could scoot off to New Orleans to join Paul McCartney for a Wings recording session.

Back to Mother. For a bizarre quit-smoking treatment, one that all but zombified him. In fact, the overwhelming reason why his return to Yoko would be lasting was that she got pregnant. Just as John and Cynthia's relationship was prolonged by Cyn's becoming pregnant with Julian. Absent the over-40 Yoko's desperate last-ditch attempt to conceive, John might very well have divorced her within a few years.

And yet we see film after film, including this one, that give every appearance of Yoko having been granted final cut in return for access to the Lennon archives in her possession. John in fact had a VERY productive 14 months or so with May Pang. Sure, it started off rough with John's Spector sessions in L.A. disintegrating, but some of that work would be salvaged and the planned oldies album WOULD be completed. So would `Walls & Bridges', which spawned a number one song, a top-ten song and an electrifying `live' guest appearance with Elton John.

So Lennon's L.A. sojourn saw alot of drinking and drugging, and being tossed from a few clubs. Sounds like a lite version of Hamburg--a much celebrated Beatles phase. But seen from Yoko's quasi-Stalinist perspective, everything bad about that stretch was caused by his being apart from her and everything good about it derived from his ties to her. May Pang gets only some token commentary in the film; no, she was obviously just a distraction from the John/Yoko romance. I suppose, too, that no one wants to hurt Sean's feelings by dwelling on what a dubious relationship his parents had. And I suppose that since May Pang moved on to marriage and kids, there is only so much she feels comfortable in saying about her `loving John' phase. But come on, enough of this John and Yoko fairytale nonsense. We'd be sick of hearing about it even if it were true. The fact that John and Yoko did return to being some semblance of a couple during their work on and promotion of `Double Fantasy' is by no means the only indicator of whether their relationship would have outlasted their 1980-(1981) co-recording blitz. Other indicators sugges not.

The film is  for the most part a wonderful tribute to John, and I much appreciate what's in it. What I don't appreciate is what's NOT in it because of Yoko's iron-fisted grip on the Lennon legacy. Skewing. Omitting. De-emphasizing. Spinning. Selective interviewing. Selective editing...all in the name of myth-making. It makes you want to see a Yoko-absent film bio of John. Yoko, we're tited of the propaganda. Give us some truth. If you really want your take on John to prevail, start by writing a memoir of John from your unique viewpoint. How is it that so many who knew John less well can do that but you can't? Instead of speaking up yourself, you silence dissenters. Is that a worthy legacy of the 1960s? No, it's positively Nixonian,",1301875200,2,3869,4.79160419790105

4229206,5,B003YGC7VM,"John Lennon's story has so many different facets that it's actually more effective to treat them rather seperately. His creaive awakenings during The Beatles of course is highly well documented in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beatles-Anthology/dp/B00008GKEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beatles Anthology</a>&nbsp;and the events in his life that formed him in the beginning got a similar treatment in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nowhere-Boy/dp/B0036TGT5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nowhere Boy</a>. All the same much about his life with Yoko Ono after the breakup of The Beatles has been shrowded in mystery and speculative thinking on many sides. This extremely well done documentary film looks to give a well balanced and unbiased look at this era of John Lennon's life,covering the years emmediatly following the demise of The Beatles all the way up to his tragic murder one decade later. And that is the decade that defines this presentation.

  We begin with John and Yoko decamping to New York after over a year of complete harrassment and mistreatment by the British press about the marriage. John finds himself in love with the city upon arrival and emmediatly takes up with two ""yippie"" icons of the period,Jerry Rubin and Abbey Hoffman with whom he becomes intensely involved in terms of politics. During this time he manages to not only record a controversial and deeply political album with Yoko called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sometime-In-New-York-City/dp/B003Y8YXG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sometime In New York City</a>&nbsp;but also manages to free the imprisoned John Sinclair and attempting to assist newly registered voters during the first election in which 18 year olds were allowed to do so. Although during the turbulant Nixon/Watergate era Lennon not only found himself on the presidents enemy list but found himself in an ongoing battle to gain his US residency and green card. These events take a toll on John's already trouble personal psyce and a public display of ludeness results in a two year seperation from Ono.

  While Yoko becomes highly creatively successful during this time John finds himself basically a derilict urban junkie/drunk in LA during what he called his ""lost weekend"". In a way it was a one off onstage appearance with mutual admirirer Elton John that reunited John and Yoko. Of course before you know it they are starting a family with their child Sean as well as John's success at receiving his green card. Much has been said on both sides about John's actions during the remainder of the 70's,lately much of it on the negative side. This docu clearly takes the side that John was genuinely committed to being the ""house husband"" he presented himself to be while Yoko handled all the business dealings. He became self consciously a private person,a non leader during the years after the birth of John and until his musical comeback with Yoko on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Fantasy/dp/B00004WGEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Fantasy</a>&nbsp;which,as this pointed out actually presented John in something of a more retro rock MOR mode and Yoko as a modern musical innovator on the cutting edge of the new wave sound.

  Of course we know where this ends;John's murder at the time where his life was finally starting to look up. Nor I or many people out there have much of an idea of every single aspect of his life as a family man in the Dakota during his final years. Not only does this discuss his life at the time but also covers in great detail the music he was making during all of these events and how it was always indelibly linked with his life. Over the years there have been many attempts to document the life of John Lennon in every conceivable variety of documentary and feature film and in most cases they've ended up either incomplete or highly bias. But during 2010,at which time John would've turned 70 both this and the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nowhere-Boy/dp/B0036TGT5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nowhere Boy</a>&nbsp;both give two of the most broad and well conseived outlooks on two seperate aspects of John's life and provide excellent insight into the sources of both his musical creativity and inner sanctum.",1297728000,7,4448,5.737481031866464

He really did love this country and wanted the best for it. Of course some of his ways of protests were a bit out there but he knew it. The music used was not common to the regular music fan but I've heard most of it already and was a nice addition to playing the common tracks off singles / albums.

4229210,4,B003YGC7VM,"Lennon NYC is an hour and fifty-one minute documentary that quickly covers Lennon's time in New York from his arrival in 1971 until his murder in 1980.  It begins with clips from the Double Fantasy sessions (his final album) and interviews with the musicians who worked with him on that album.  Clips from the poorly received Some Time In New York City as well as Mind Games and Walls and Bridges are also included in the film.

Lennon and Yoko Ono came to New York City to escape England where they, Ono in particular, were treated badly by the English press.  New York offered them a sense of freedom and the opportunity to reinvent themselves.  As is noted in this documentary, Lennon was happy to be able to find a jacket at a trendy clothing store in New York, pay for it, and leave without any hassle.  But they also arrived during a time of activism and war resistance.  This documentary describes Lennon's connection with activists Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, and Rennie Davis which lead to years of deportation threats, phone tapping, and shadowing by the federal government.  Lennon did have supporters in government, though, including a congressmen who wrote a letter read by Lennon on the Dick Cavett Show supporting his use of the N-word in the song ""Woman is the N----- of the World.""

This reviewer gained a greater respect for Yoko Ono who has many interview clips in this documentary.  When John cheated on her, she showed that she could move on with herself and her career without him.  She also would not allow John--who fell into drink--to return to her until he was ready.  The nicest parts of the documentary for this reviewer are when John and Yoko got back together following Lennon's concert with Elton John in New York (Elton John also appears in interview clips in this documentary).  Lennon won his deportation case, celebrated his 35th birthday and the birth of his son Sean on the same day.  After that, he took a hiatus from the music business to became a house husband for a few years and this film offers home movies and audio clips of John with his little boy.

More clips from the Double Fantasy sessions are presented.  Lennon went back to his early rock 'n roll roots and was writing songs for his generation.  Yoko Ono finally received good reviews for her songs on the album.  Then, of course, December 8, 1980 happened.  The documentary does not dwell on his death.  Yoko Ono and others give their reactions that day but then it shifts to a reflection on his work.  Although the film is almost two hours, it moves very quickly.  There are no bonuses on this disc.",1293321600,13,2603,4.637554585152839
4229211,4,B003YGC7VM,"Lennonyc is yet another great film from the PBS American Masters series.  Directed and produced by Michael Epstein, the film focuses on the years John Lennon spent in New York City from 1971-1980.  It shows pretty much all the details of his life from this period including his on going immigration problems to his separation from Yoko in his Lost Weekend years in Los Angeles to the recording of the music he made during this time.  There are clips of footage from his concert at Madison Square Garden in '72 which is his one and only full length concert during the 70's (there are audio clips & pictures of his final time on stage ever at MSG with Elton John) as well as home videos of his time with Sean as a house husband.  Mr. Epstein has gathered an impressive list of interviewees to give their special insight into Mr. Lennon including those who knew his best like Yoko Ono, photographer and friend Bob Gruen (who took the famous photo of Mr. Lennon with the New York City shirt), members of his one time backing band Elephant's Memory, his immigration attorney Leon Wildes, Elton John and many others.
