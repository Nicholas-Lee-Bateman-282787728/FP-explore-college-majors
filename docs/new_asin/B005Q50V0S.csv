8515927,1,B005Q50V0S,Not one band you (or anyone else) have ever heard of. Why even make a documentary? Ego. Spokane was not an important musical hub and you can see why.,1374278400,2,149,4.172413793103448
8515928,5,B005Q50V0S,"So you know where I'm coming from with this review, I am briefly in this film. I was born in Spokane, was going to college there in '82, was in a punk band , moved to Seattle in '88, moved back to Spokane in 2007, and in 2009 myself and a ton of other people organized a giant reunion for all the punk/wavo types. Over 350 people turned out for the three day event. That reunion was the spark for this film.

Standing back and taking a critical view of the film I can honestly say that ""Spokanarchy"" does a really great job of capturing the essence of the ""underground/punk/new wave scene in Spokane '78-'89. Spokane could represent any mid-sized town that had an alternative scene. Sure it wasn't New York or London but we had the same energy. We played in bands, wrote zines, had crazy film night parties at the ""art house"" theater, insane house parties, put on shows and dances in rented out old auto body shops and grotto halls. We didn't do it to impress anyone from L.A. or Seattle, we did it to entertain each other. Does this film capture all the nuances and every single band, and chronicle each year? no.
It does capture the energy (creative & destructive), and the spirit that thrived during those times. Remember we didn't have the internet or mobile phones, we did have telephone poles and flyers, there were a few record stores that carried this sort of music which were the hubs. You'd meet people there, post flyers, get turned on to some new band ,exchange mix tapes, get an old music magazine from England and glean something from it,tweak it and make it yours. I don't think we were as pretentious as NY or L.A. because we knew no one was watching what was happening in Spokane. We did it for ourselves.

The Premier of this film took place in Spokane at the Garland Theater with over 560 people attending. If you've seen ""the Decline of Western Civilization"", ""Another State of Mind"", or ""Kill your Idols"" This is just as entertaining and perhaps more endearing because Spokane wasn't on anyone's radar back then, no one even cared about Seattle yet, no one cared what happened in Spokane, we made things happen because we wanted to Make-Things-Happen... and still do.",1363651200,,2188,4.564885496183206
