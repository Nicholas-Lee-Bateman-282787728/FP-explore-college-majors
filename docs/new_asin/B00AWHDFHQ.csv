5523188,2,B00AWHDFHQ,what a waste of effort.  POOR. POOR. POOR. where's the animation? All I saw were jerky movements at best and a lot of stills. In a lot of cases the mouth moves and just the mouth. This thing is chopped up in something like 12 minute chapters then the ... (are you ready) credits run and run and run. so you have to either sit thru it or fast forward. Marvel should be ashamed of this. Don't waste your time and money on this. I fell asleep 3 times watching this drivel.,1366934400,,469,4.0978260869565215

5523190,2,B00AWHDFHQ,"Shipped in a paper CD case in a plastic sleeve. Packaging cost roughly 2 dollars I'm guessing. With the cheapness of the packaging I would have given it 3 stars.

It's only getting 2 because it's a MOTION COMIC. It's not an animated movie. The voice work is very well done if you're into this sort of thing, and since I'm stuck with it, I'll suck it up this time, but I'm done with Marvel Knight products if they're all motion comics.

Next time please clearly state that in the product description eh?",1366675200,15,502,4.387096774193548
5523191,1,B00AWHDFHQ,The movie was only 12 min long. If I could curse on here I would. The interview was longer than the show. 30 min. Never would I buy another movie from Marvel Knights. Also the graphics was like from 1998. I can not see how someone could have given this 5 stars unless they work for Marvel.,1366675200,12,289,4.087719298245614
5523192,5,B00AWHDFHQ,"Finally, Paul Jenkins & Jae Lee's impressive saga featuring cult favorite team, The Inhumans! I'm a big fan of motion comics & Marvel Knights are pretty much some of the very best that this fairly new medium has to offer. For those that don't like to sit & actually read books or panel for panel this is the best alternative. Paul Jenkins & Jae Lee's Inhumans was surely one of Marvel's best & most ambitious work's, & an obvious example of great comic book triumphs. 'Nuff said.",1360454400,34,479,4.517241379310345

5523221,2,B00AWHDFHQ,"This is an excellent Inhumans story. The art is excellent, the story is outstanding, the music is great, but the presentation is awful. This story is broken down into a series of too short segments. To watch each segment, you have to sit through this ridiculously long title sequence that is okay the first time you see it, but then you want to make it go away and you can't. So you have to sit through nearly a third of the time spent on each segment watching this stupid sequence that you have memorized by the second viewing. Poor planning. They need to have  a viewing option that allows you to watch the whole thing uninterrupted by the annoyingly redundant credit sequence. Someone needs to get this whole series turned around because all the other Marvel Knights animated features have the same problem. Incidentally,, I have no problem whatsoever with the animation methods uses here. They essentially take some detail of the printed page and make it move with relatively simple animation techniques. I assume this is way less expensive than animating the whole story from scratch. I not only don't mind that but I enjoy it as it gives a very interesting, arty feel to the presentation that is terrific. I just can't get past the repetitive titles micro segment problem.

5523230,3,B00AWHDFHQ,"Honestly, the artwork and idea to make an inhuman motion comic was nice, but I think the fans are going to be expecting more. With a guy like black bolt who can't speak and is supposed to be so powerful, doesn't do much, it kinda makes the fans feel as if they spent their money on hopes and dreams... not to ruin it for the true fans but don't be expecting to see some awesome fight scenes like in the X-men motion comic. That would satisfy the fans better I think. A lot of potential here, but it doesn't deliver in my opinion.",1440374400,,529,4.145631067961165
5523231,1,B00AWHDFHQ,"Don't bother buying or renting this, Very Limited animation, should be listed as kind of comic book and not a movie. Rented it from Netflix.bad choice the thing looks like a Graphic Novel with only the mouth moving and maybe the hands and arms only slightly any thing like flying is in the form silhouette moving across the background at a distance.
I stopped watching after a few minutes when it became apparent this was the way the whole feature was and not just the opening sequence.
If like this kind program then this is for you, otherwise don't even bother with it.
I would give it -5(*****) Stars for being so poor, this reminds me the early days of cartoons on TV with barely any movement and the was live element pasted over the the characters face when they spoke.

However if you want an engaging story with good voice acting then this is for you.  I don't know much about the Inhumans outside of a few cartoon appearances but this painted them, and their society, in a very unique way.  I enjoyed how the writer took a very comic book concept and mixed it with real world elements.  Made for a great watch.

5523289,5,B00AWHDFHQ,I thought that this was pretty good. I find the inumans very interesting characters. like how can you have the main character Black Bolt have the super power if he talks he can demolish everything in his path so he can't talk that's a cool character and so are the rest. I think that this story needed to be told and that the motion comic should be realesed at least they are working on other characters in the marvel universe and not the popular ones. don't get me wrong I love all the main marvel characters but it's good to venture off and explore other characters I hope they do a live action movie of them. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1391904000,,667,4.21875

5523292,2,B00AWHDFHQ,"Without being super-spoilerish, I wish there was a  ""geographical reveal"" at the end. It left me very unsatisfied. Not having read this particular series, I hope there was one in the print version.
I have a lot of reservations about the story and its strange incongruities with what I remember about previous iterations of The Inhumans...but that's a big problem with my enjoyment of Marvel and DC the past couple of decades and too long of a discussion to go into here.

I want to just to address the presentational aspects regarding this product:

1. a) What was with the lack of subtitles. Incredibly cheap not to include them.
  b )On the same topic, being as this was a ""motion-comic"" I might have appreciated the choice to see captions and  word balloons now and again...
2. The darkness was a bit much. Not a huge fan of Jae Lee to begin with, but this could have used some brightening.
3. The complete credits after each chapter and the overwrought theme music left me very cold. Could the producers have created a more seamless union between chapters?  That music was just...ugh. And relentlessly so. Thank heavens for the ""next"" button functionality, at the very least.
4. The voice-over narration was monotonous and pretty unoriginal, a bit hackneyed.

That's it. It's quite somethng to me that if I had enjoyed the story and art more, I might have not been so irritated by the lack of care in the presentation. I'm betting the old analog static paper comic-book version suits the meditative and pensive tone of the storyline with much more success...otherwise I would be wondering at how bad a year in comics it was when this series was awarded an Eisner.",1390176000,,1667,4.724137931034483

After the Thing survived his master blow Black Bolt was helpless. The rest of the of the Inhumans saved his hide or the Thing would have beaten him to a pulp. Way back in the very first appearance of the Inhumans in FF. Also the Hulk busted him up pretty good in WW Hulk. Anyways I read the trade and only gave it an OK. I would purchase another motion comic though if I know I will like the story. Loved those old 1966 Marvel animations which were basically the same thing 45 years earlier.,1371945600,,644,4.16

5523325,5,B00AWHDFHQ,"The Inhumans have always been my favorite heroes in the Marvel Universe ever since I was introduced to them through mid 70's issues of the Fantastic Four. The Inhumans struck me as something different and very cool. Their battles and team ups with the FF, Sub Mariner, Spiderman and the Hulk among others as well as the in fighting of the royal family itself was often created some of the best and most dramatic stories of all time. As often happens, I had stopped reading comics by the late 1990's and was lost as to what was happening in the Universe. I discovered the Marvel Knights Inhumans graphic novel while floating around on Amazon about a year ago. I loved everything about it. The art and the complex storyline drew me in immediately. This motion comic captures the novel very well. Keep in mind this is NOT full animation so don't expect it to be. Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy the ride.",1368576000,12,909,4.481927710843373
5523326,4,B00AWHDFHQ,"When I read the Marvel Knights Inhumans in the late 1990s I was absolutely drawn into the complexity of the story by author Paul Jenkins right away. Add to that the stunning visuals of artist Jae Lee and it was a recipe for greatness that I have turned numerous friends onto over the years. I would love to see this team revisit these characters again someday.
This ""motion comic"" captures all of the high points and though a bit clunky (like ALL motion comics) it is forgivable because the artwork is so damned good in it's still form. The voice casting is strong. Not EXACTLY what I heard in my head as a reader, but we all bring our own prejudices to the table with a form of literature that has been adapted from another source.
If I have one criticism it would be to not have to go back to the intro and outro title sequences between episodes if trying to watch it as a long form movie.",1368576000,5,891,4.27810650887574

5523328,4,B00AWHDFHQ,"I love the Inhumans. They are and have always been my favorite Marvel characters. That being the case it's been a labor of love trying to not only collect their storyline but follow it. How many writers have tried their hand at Attilans royal family? How many artists? How many times has their history been rewritten? Characters (poor Ahura) omitted and maligned? From their very roots they had no real home in the Marvel universe. Black Bolt, Medusa and crew jumped from inbetween the lines of the Fantastic Four to bonus features in a number of Marvels popular titles. They were given a few chances at ongoing series' but nothing ever stuck and they became Marvels ultimate go to guest stars.

When Jae lee and Paul Jenkins tried their hands at giving my favorite inbred dynasty new life I was overwhelmed with excitement. I had never seen them portrayed so vibrantly and their world and culture so thoroughly explored. Ann Nocenti and Bret Blevins come in at a close second with their wrenching tale of Medusas pregnancy back in '88 but I digress. I hoped against my better judgment that the Lee, Jenkins 12 issue run would turn into something more permanent. Unfortunately history has a tendency to repeat itself and the Inhumans were again thrust into obscurity.

Enter 2013. It's been over ten years since the Eisner award winning series ended. The Inhumans have had their ups and downs. Black Bolt is now a polygamist and Medusa is a member of the Fantastic Four for the 2nd time, among other things. As you can imagine I was VERY surprised to see this motion comic on the new release shelf of a large retailer chain of all places. Aren't The Inhumans relegated to the back of bargain boxes or paradoxically behind the counter in display case worthy issues of old Fan Four? Something was up. I had seen motion comics before and enjoyed the experience so I happily and quixotically picked purchased it.

I guess at this point it would be overkill to state that I more than enjoyed this little treat. There's few things more gratifying then seeing characters you've held in your mind for a lifetime come to (partial) life. I knew going into this that it WASN'T a fully animated feature but even given that it wasn't the animation still surpassed my expectations set by previous motion comics. In fact I'd have to say the level of movement here was reminiscent of Archer or Aqua Teen. Nothing to complain about if you ask me.

Unexpected and overjoyed to see this sort of thing coming to light and the Inumans getting a little play. I've noticed a lot other re-releases for Marvels Royals on the horizon and even a new action figure set....could Marvel have something in the works? I certainly hope so.",1368403200,4,2706,4.690526315789474
5523329,2,B00AWHDFHQ,"Marvel's ""InHumans"" was one of my favorite comics as a child. I was so excited to see that story finally make it to Animation. After months of anticipation, I was defiantly disappointed. For one, the original Amazon.com description of this offering, did NOT mention this was a primitive stop-motion animation, sorry, I don't know the technical term for what this mess actually is, but it's not fully animated. The motion seems similar to the old marvel cartoons from the 1960's (comic strips with slight gestural movements). The story was not bad in itself. The voice narration from Black Bolt's point of view was interesting, bordering on being over used. In my opinion, this would have been much, much better; if this was done by a decent anime company. One word of warning; Avoid any title labeled ""Marvel Knights"", and save your cash.

I gave this ""Opus"" two stars, just for bring back a childhood favorite. Let's just hope Disney/Marvel decides to do this classic next time, with a decent Japanese anime company.",1367884800,2,1017,4.912790697674419
5523330,4,B00AWHDFHQ,I wasn't familiar at all with the Inhumans before I bought the DVD. It was interesting. I liked it. I just wish the episodes were longer than 12 minutes each. I was able to finish the entire DVD within an hour. The animation was cool.,1367539200,4,234,4.222222222222222
5523331,1,B00AWHDFHQ,wait for it now that Disney bought starwars & marvel are to be chopped to pieces lost of all authenticity & continuity save those comics ahh... graphic novels at least dc got a chance to catch up & keep it real I'm 51 & reading has always been fundamental,1367107200,,255,4.224489795918367
5523332,5,B00AWHDFHQ,"If you are not in any way familiar with motion comics, I am not sure what particular motion comic would be the best introduction for you, but this is not a bad way to begin. Like the writer of this series, Paul Jenkins, I had never heard of The Inhumans, but this really worked to my advantage, to learn of The Inhumans in this way. I think my father-in-law has perhaps mentioned The Inhumans, but his comic collection is so, AWESOME!, that because he has told me so much about Marvel & its history, this title would have been lost in the shuffle. Before I was injured, I was a freelance illustrator, primarily drawing & painting portraits. Until my father-in-law pulled out some of his comics, it had been over 20 years since I had looked at a comic book. I was depressed at how my gift was & is severely affected, yet he kind of brought me full circle with my art and its beginnings, and enjoying the art of others became strangely therapeutic for me, at least emotionally & mentally. I could never marry comic art with the realism of portraiture, so I was unexpectedly re~freshed from this, and it has been juvenescent for me. This is said to help you understand my particular perspective and why you should not be discouraged by what some other reviews have said. To be sure, motion comics ARE NOT traditional animations. These are works that are being created from artwork that was not originally intended for animation, so the look and feel is pausingly unseductive yet attractively unique, peculiar yet fascinating, all at the same time. Iron Man: Extremis was my introduction to motion comics, as I first discovered it on iTunes. It was not until the 3rd episode that I became aware that these were being made from comic books, and that element was intriguing. I immediately purchased the hardcover of Iron Man: Extremis, and I love it. But The Inhumans does not feel like Extremis, does not feel like Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers, does not feel like Spider~Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. But, you clearly recognize that just from the initial and continual movements of the motion comic, they do not possess the fluidity of the morning cartoons, and that is what is so appealing. The decision making to determine how to bring movement from the limbs, the mouth, voices, backgrounds, while preserving and not offending those who know the comics while still capturing a new audience with a different feel of the same comics; that is just astounding and has to be applauded. If you purchase the DVD for Iron Man: Extremis, the artist, Adi Granov, explains how he could never have envisioned how comic book art could be translated into this medium. However, even he was pleasantly surprised that it was crafted particularly well for animation despite the fact that the art originally lacked the purposed foundation & scope for this function. For The Inhumans, I decided to watch the bonus feature first, and it paid off. It provides much background on The Inhumans, and the social implications and how they are tied in make this even more inviting. So much thought is put in to making comics, and depending on what you have been exposed to, in terms of reading and history, comics often repeat or mimic many ideologies, mythologies or theologies, re~packaging them and presenting them in different ways. The Inhumans and motion comics are an extension of these considerations, so with that in mind, give this a try. It is indeed different, but it is not bad.",1366934400,34,3457,4.734660033167496
