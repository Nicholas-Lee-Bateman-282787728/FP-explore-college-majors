4712703,5,B005JJCMQ2,"I would say that this show is for at least older teenagers. The cover blurp would have you think that the reason is violence. BTW, the main on-screen violence is in the first episode and the last two. I believe that the real reason is that it is ostensibly about a delusional, psychotic teenager whose delusions become real. In addition, other people also have delusions, and the delusions have delusions. The result is that in order to properly follow the story, you need to be able to follow what is real and what isn't. Otherwise you will end up being very confused.

The story opens with our hero, a teenage otaku, who is living in a metal shipping crate on the roof of a building. He has a sister who visits him periodically, but he spends most of his time with his delusional anime girl-friend. He periodically goes to school. If he isn't gaming, he is doing on-line chatting with his friends. As the story opens there have been two sets of murders.  The pace takes off when someone sends him a pic of a horrific murder. The next day (at night), he witnesses that murder in progress. He sees a girl he doesn't know at the scene covered with blood, with the murder weapons in hand. He runs, and is caught in a surveillance camera, so now the police are searching for him.

The next day at school he finds that he is sitting next to the girl, who says that she has known him all his life. Other girls enter the story, one of which says that the hero himself sent the email with the pic of the murder, and others that say he should awaken. Then the girls start carrying swords. Then the EVIL organization enters the action.  Shibuya will never be the same, since it gets pretty well destroyed.

The end result is a psycho-thriller, where you are kept wondering what is real and what isn't. If you liked the psycho-thriller Perfect Blue, I think you will like this one also.

The package comes with four disks, two DVDs and two Blu-Ray.  I watched the Blu-Ray and the quality was very good. The main characters were hand drawn and the swords were CGI, which added to the impact of their supposing to be delusions made real. The extras were some trailers, text-less credits, and a song.",1322784000,29,2187,4.4525
4712704,4,B005JJCMQ2,"This show is definitely worth watching, as its story and character development are fantastic. The show starts off strong, has a great middle portion, and then just sort of.. ends. They build up too many characters to end the show in as few episodes as they did, if the show had been more focused on fewer characters, or had been significantly longer in order to come to a fitting conclusion for such a fantastic build up, this show would be up there with the likes of Ghost Hound and Serial Experiments: Lain.

All in all, if you are a fan of the science/mystery/suspense genre of anime I definitely suggest watching this. But if you have not seen them I absolutely recommend watching Lain, Ghost Hound, and Dennou Coil above this.",1322784000,21,731,4.623076923076923
4712705,3,B005JJCMQ2,"I don't want to rag on the show too much because it is decent. Its got great atmosphere, an interesting premise, and some interesting character designs and personalities for the main cast. The problem comes in that Chaos;Head starts off strong with an intriguing mystery and bizarre behavior from the main character, but it fails to deliver any sort of satisfaction with its conclusion. The science is poorly explained, the main villain comes almost out of nowhere, and it isn't ever made clear what some of the characters' connections to the main plot or sub-plots were. The main problem with Chaos;Head is a lack of focus. If they had trimmed down the number of characters and steered the story to follow the main protagonist more often, then this would have been far more enjoyable. I still think people should watch this show, but I can't really recommend a purchase.",1322524800,67,871,4.852348993288591

4712712,5,B005JJCMQ2,"- Comments: Pretty cool anime. It does get pretty confusing at times. But in a suspenseful way. Which is good since this keeps the viewer guessing and makes them more prone to being surprised; as a predictable anime may be too boring for many. The waifus are nice, too.
===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: This anime is refreshing with its main character being a major shut-in. Because not every main character is a charismatic guy. Like many people, he finds the safest place is inside his home. To his dismay, danger is always right around the corner. Just like in real life. Title fits the anime well since chaos not only exists around you, but also within one's head/mind.

This anime also shows that many people rely on escapism. That is, they often attempt to forget their surroundings by immersing themselves in another world: The virtual world known as the internet. This is very relatable for many viewers. In many ways, the main character may serve as a reflection of some of us.

Fortunately, this anime also emphasizes that no matter how ""unique"" a person is, and how much they may be ostracized from others due to various differences, there is always someone out there that will accept them. This kind of detail is appreciated. Though most of this anime is fairly serious and establishes plenty atmospheres and tones of suspense and drama.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and some fan-service.

So why I am I writing about Steins;Gate in a review of Chaos;Head?  Because as the similar example of improper semicolon use should have suggested, these are the work of the same creators.  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotics-Notes/dp/B01EIW2REC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotics;Notes</a>&nbsp;is another entry in their Science Adventure Series, several loosely related tales that take place within the same universe.)  However, while Steins;Gate is truly great, its predecessor Chaos;Head is merely good.

Takumi Nishijou is a semi-delusional hardcore anime Otaku (and borderline shut-in) who lives in a shipping container on top of an apartment building in Tokyos Shibuya District and has actually calculated the minimum number of days he must attend his private school in order to be able to graduate.  One day while playing video games, he is sent pictures of a horrific murder. He ignores it as a prank, but while walking home the next day, he comes across that exact scenewith the addition of a pink-haired girl, stakes in hand.  Before he knows it he finds himself at the center of a series of bizarre serial killings, of which he is soon suspected, while at the same time fearing he is one of the next targets.  He tries to retreat into his own delusions only to find that there are people running about capable of causing others to see the delusions they choose to send them and (shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paprika/dp/B000VWYJ5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paprika</a>) in some cases causing those delusions to become reality.  There's also a bunch of girls wandering around with invisible swords only Takumi can see who exhibit varying reactions to the fact that he can see said invisible swords.  Then things get weird.

There are definite similarities between the way the two plots unfold, which makes for easier comparison, and in many cases we can see how the creators used what they learned from the faults of Chaos;Head to improve Steins;Gate.  First, make it longer.  In retrospect 12 episodes simply wasn't enough to tell the tale properly, and the compression got so bad towards the end that the chief villain was forced into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/monologuing/dp/B003BNY702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">monologuing</a>&nbsp;almost nonstop in order to get all of the necessary exposition out, and though the big questions largely do get answered, a lot of the smaller ones never do.

Second, make the characters, particularly the main character, more interesting and worth caring for.  Takumi Nishijou is a staggeringly unlikable character for most of the show: cringing, cowardly, and so self-absorbed that he can watch a pretty girl classmate fall bleeding in front of him and just walk on by.  He spends most of the show avoiding doing the right thing, and while he improves greatly at the end, he's no Rintarou Okabe.  In addition the main cast never really comes together as a group, and until the very end the girls are so interchangeable that you may have to memorize their hair colors and hairstyles in order to tell them apart.  In contrast Steins;Gate has one of the most uniquely diverse main casts in anime history who make it clear to viewers how much they care for each other even while they desperately try to conceal that fact from each other.  The main protagonist's love interest is much less clear in Chaos;Head than in Steins;Gate despite the fact that the identity of the latter's love interest is completely up in the air until the endings in the virtual novel.  Finally, I'd argue that a big reason for all the various sequels and side stories to Steins;Gate is the fact that fans just can't get enough of the characters.  In contrast only a single supporting character from Chaos;Head reappears in the sequel Chaos;Child, and most players and viewers no doubt shouted, ""Good riddance!""

So in the end I can truly recommend Chaos;Head only to fans of Steins;Gate looking to explore a little more of their shared universe.  For anyone else it is going to be interesting and thought provoking but probably not a favorite.",1465862400,,4716,5.715307582260372

Overall, this is not a bad show. Personally, I can get into this type of show. But this one, I felt a bit disappointed in. and for a couple of reasons. While I can understand the point of view of the main character, what I have a problem with is they drag out his problem, and the story, too much. They seem to take too long to get somewhere, with what is actually going on. They leave too many questions about things, and do not really explain the villains position well enough either. A good example is at the beginning of the show, the main guy is alone, no real friends, and is kind of scared of others. So he has this complex, or maybe I should say fetish, of this imaginary anime girl, like she is real.. That is all fine and dandy.. But when other start coming around, and he is not alone anymore, he still clings on to his fetish girl, all the way, just about to the end of the show. You need some kind of transition stage when people change.. and with him. it is suddenly.. Just a bit too fast. One day you need it, the next you don't... type of thing.. It is things like that, that degraded the show. Looking outside of those things, it was a decent story line, and concept.. It just was not implemented well enough.",1450396800,2,1433,4.136200716845878

The anime starts off very strong, but as the series progresses the limited time space of 12 episodes clearly became too much of a burden for them to fit the 20-30 hour long VN in without making huge sacrifices to the content. Aside from majorly censoring a lot of the psychological tension the anime also cuts many important scenes from the source leaving a whole lot of questions.

Chaos Head was a little different. There was enough that was interesting to keep me going, but to be honest getting the first half of the series was a struggle. The premise was interesting but where it seems to fall flat is that all of the characters are extremely underdeveloped so you really don't care about any of them. They all have idiosyncrasies that might have been interesting but with no backstory as to where they come from it prevents you getting absorbed. The pace seems to correct for the last half and you do want to see what happens next, but then they leave ending as fairly unfulfilling too. Beat bad guy- the end. A longer story arc to explain the characters quirks and motivations better and some form denouement might have made this a fairly compelling anime but as it stands you get very little in the way of emotional investment for the time you put in.",1422057600,,1046,4.453125
4712758,1,B005JJCMQ2,"Absolutely, the worst anime I have ever watched.

There's about five or six episodes of genuine interesting build up that happens in the start of the series, and perhaps that's part of why I place it at the top of my list for the worst anime I've seen, because it's a monumental let down. It doesn't even have the decency to start bad and stay bad like other B-list anime, it starts great and then turns into a car wreck.

There's an interesting concept here. Mysterious murders, guy that's clearly unstable, a series of strange and beautiful women who are inexplicably interested in him.

Unfortunately, after building up about a dozen story threads, it culminates in a wretched wet fart of a conclusion. Several threads are just dead in the water without resolution, at least two just seem to quit by offering up a tangential character that shows up for all of five minutes and then exits with no real closure.

The biggest problem is that there is no character arc. The whiny little jerk you meet in episode one is the whiny little jerk you see in episode 12. He fights the big bad guy, loses terribly (literally raped in the butt), and is instead saved by the girls that the plot just spent the past two episodes excusing from battle.

The final kick in the head and death pinch to your grapes is the fact that once the big bad is destroyed, the evil HQ literally disappears in a shower of sparkles and the heroes just stand around in a bit of rubble. All of the enormous psychological trauma everyone just experienced is laughed of with a pan up to blue sky.

Screw everything about this stupid anime. I pity anyone who wastes their money on this utter garbage.

4712769,4,B005JJCMQ2,I thought I was figuring out the series as the episodes went on but it only got more complicated / puzzling.

I hate how the main male character is always so sadly down and depressed. This show is way too confusing, talks about a boy who should of never existed in that world, he was really that old man in the wheel chair.",1353196800,,425,4.182926829268292

He witnesses a murder and gets involved with a bunch of chicks that can materialize swords and have other strange powers. He has a unfortunate past that he has somehow forgotten. He is also the key to saving the city from the murderer.

Chaos;Head is a very strange anime. I was kind of confused for an episode or 2. It's hard to figure out what's real and what's not. If you try not to figure it out and over think it you'll probably enjoy it more. The animation and the voice acting are good, and the story is pretty involved. The saving grace of this anime is the cast of characters. The characters are pretty cool and interesting. I actually enjoyed it more the 2nd time around. The story is very heavy and not for everyone. I think every anime fan should watch it, but I would try to rent it or watch it on youtube first.",1350000000,2,938,4.269662921348314
4712772,4,B005JJCMQ2,"I rarely write reviews; I'm just not good with describing things.

There are some anime that will confuse you and maintain that general atmospheric vibe -- if you are into that sort of thing, then Chaos;Head probably isn't it. Let's be clear: I wouldn't even consider this to be in the same genre as the aforementioned anime. If anything, this should be compared to its successor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate-Complete-Series-Part-One-Limited-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B008O69T18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate: Complete Series: Part One (Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-Control-The-Money-Soul-of-Possibility-Blu-ray/dp/B008MSNY7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C: Control - The Money & Soul of Possibility [Blu-ray</a>]. It's more of a sci-fi with psychological thriller elements, than a psychological thriller with sci-fi elements.

What Chaos;Head is: an anime that's based on a visual novel. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of visual novels, they are like novels, except they usually have text over graphics and some music composition in the form of software. They have limited interaction, sort of like an extremely linear text-based role-playing game. Sometimes there will be choices you make at key points of a story. One popular concept in visual novels is that, as the main character, you play through the same world multiple times, and with each play-through, as you gather more information about the world, your character makes better decisions, leading up to the ""true"" ending. (for an example, see 999 on Nintendo DS)

So as you can see, when adapting visual novels into anime, the producers will have to either choose one ending that they want to capitalize on, or somehow cycle through all the endings, with the main character eventually gaining some power that transcends an individual world; because the main character must have the unique ability to remember events that occurred in previous play-throughs. Visual novels usually start out with Question Arcs to build up a mystery, but end with Answer Arcs to explain everything.

The nature of being a visual novel makes Chaos;Head differ from true mind-bending anime in that, as the story progresses, the questions will be explained in various ways, usually involving some psycho-(or techno-) babble, and ending with the main character as the only person that could change the world. Cliched, yes. But that's how visual novels go.

Chaos;Head, the anime, only goes through the story once. The main character is seemingly paranoid schizophrenic, but does (eventually) develop; in fact, his schizophrenia will play an important role in the plot. Enjoy his psychological breakdown in the first episodes, but later on in the series, you might want to slow down and digest what some of the other characters are rambling about. Several key conversations are essential to understanding the plot, even if they seem ridiculous at first.

I must admit, for those of you that are on the fence of whether to get this or not, the sophomoric effort of 5pb/Nitro+ (the authors of the visual novel), Steins;Gate, is a much better anime, not the least because it is twice as long, lending to a more developed plot -- Steins;Gate I consider to be a masterpiece, one of my favorite sci-fi anime. I didn't watch Chaos;Head until after I watched Steins;Gate, and although it's convoluted and a bit more cliche and less imaginative, the personality of the 2 anime are very similar. If you are pessimistic, watch Steins;Gate first, and then decide if you would like more from the same authors.

I recommend this anime to those who like to think a bit more than the average person (perhaps you weren't confused when you watched Inception or Donny Darko); it starts off mysterious but ends more or less shounen in the last couple episodes. I feel the shounen aspect is like a darker, more raw, more complicated, more sci-fi oriented version of Star Driver in that the powers that the characters develop have the ability to change the universe as we know it (and of course the final antagonist wants to play God). This is not a spoiler because it's pretty common in anime; par for the course.",1344470400,19,5228,6.018817204301075
4712773,3,B005JJCMQ2,"Was very very slow starting out, I have a short attention span for movies so this was rough for me. It was slow to the climax, took half the movie to get there. Then it was a short ending, lacking the bells and whistles. Ok to watch, but I suggest barrowing it, not buying it.",1344384000,,276,4.036363636363636
4712774,3,B005JJCMQ2,"Chaos;Head is 13 episodes long and sold for 70 bucks when first put on the market. What a ripoff and no I have not bought this series but I have seen it on Funimation on Demand. The story demands it should have been at least 26 to 52 episodes long. The reasons include an antagonist the LITERILY pops out of NOWHERE, under-developed concepts and characters, a rather large cast of main/importent characters of at least 15, and a nice, creepy atmoshere ruined within two or three episodes. It is not a terrible series but if it just a strait up horror series rather than not turning it into an action series during the last four or five episodes it would have been alot better. If you were looking for a good anime horror series look else where like Shiki. It seems that it wanted to be longer but due to a (perhaps) low budget it had to be too short to be great.",1339977600,,862,4.294478527607362
4712775,4,B005JJCMQ2,"As someone who's played the visual novel (Japanese story-based video game) on which this anime is based off of, I must say that the anime is disappointingly lackluster in comparison.  Which isn't to say the anime wasn't great, it was.  But, the game is just so much better.  So, I can't exactly warrant throwing down $40 on this when you can purchase and English patch the game instead.
Seriously do.  It's an AMAZING game.  (For anyone who's played any other visual novels, I'd say this is second only to Ever 17: The Out of Infinity...and that is saying a LOT)",1339459200,,562,4.58
4712776,2,B005JJCMQ2,"If you are like me, you have stumbled across Chaos;Head due to the anime Steins;Gate, both having been created by 5pb. and Nitroplus. However, Chaos;Head does not measure up to Steins;Gate in any sort of positive way. In a nutshell, Chaos;Head is plagued by: inconsistent animation that varies from mediocre to garbage; a cast of ridiculously unlikable characters that you will be cheering to get the axe; and an overly ambitious plot that eventually devolves into what feels like fan-fiction. It is hard to believe that this load of tripe came from the same studio that gave us Steins;Gate. However, I recommend you save your money and wait for the eventual release of S;G on Blu-ray...I know I wish I had done the same!",1338681600,2,721,4.82258064516129

4712780,3,B005JJCMQ2,"Chaos;Head was something I'd been very intrigued with long before it made its way here. So i was very excited when Funimation announced it would be localized for an American audience. It features a hikikimori (Japanese Social Recluse) who experiences delusions and horrible hallucinations of things like murder, betrayal, and isolation. This is of course welcome. He meets a cast of girls (who all like him of course since this anime is based on a visual novel) who attempt to pull him away from his computer screen and his fear of society. Each of these girls is very endearing, all of them having their own quirks and charms.
The main character, however is not. He spends most of his time regressing into a fixation with ""2-D Girls"" and he can't get through a sentence, let alone feeling, without uttering how he loves 2d girls and is disenchanted with anything real. It's a fine defense mechanism to express when it isn't entirely transparent, shallow, and repeated ad nauseum. But it is. When he isn't obssessing over 2-d girls (a rare occurrence) he's sitting in the fetal position, feeling sorry for himself while one of the girls does their best to convince him he isn't a waste of life (how do they believe this themselves). He is a terrible main character and I can't state that enough.
The show itself revolves around the idea that people's ideas and dreams can be made real and can change the world. This is handled very well and carries into the central conflict of the plot. The reasoning behind this is elaborate, and it's the backstory that really shines in this narrative. The usual happenings are clich-ridden and unexciting, but it's when the mysteries of the murder and the wheelchair bound man are unfolding that the story is incredibly engrossing and hard to stop watching. I was drawn to this show by the promise of delusions, murder, and hot girls having sword battles, all put together by the creator of Deathnote (my favorite anime. Just as a point of reference, the mastermind behind Deathnote's story was not involved in this.)
This isn't a GREAT show.  It's a good show, at times being very interesting and charming, and at other times being extremely generic and flat. You're probably better off watching Deathnote or Welcome to the NHK if you're looking for really good anime that's kind of like this",1327363200,3,2330,4.796019900497512
4712781,3,B005JJCMQ2,"The first few episodes are solidly entertaining and hold their ground as they present: A series of mysterious deaths, teenagers who can make awesome swords appear out of thin air, mass hypnosis conspiracies, and a paranoid otaku who finds himself caught up in all of this. Those things are what made the original Chaos;Head visual novel that this series is based off of a thrilling experience.

Sadly, after the first few episodes much disappointment is to be had. Many events that should take entire episodes to cover were heavily condensed and lots of important explanations are only briefly summarized or left out entirely. If they had slowed the pace down considerably and made it 24 episodes this show could have been so much more. Though it does have its moments overall, this show is pretty terrible.

Though that's not say I wouldn't buy this. You get an attractive case with both Blu-rays and Dvds and at a most reasonable price. I wouldn't quite shell out 70 bucks for it, but when you offer it on sale for just 30$, it's a pretty attractive buy....",1326326400,,1059,4.75
4712782,2,B005JJCMQ2,"The animation and music are very good. Some attempt is made to make deeper characters. However, the story and plotting is poor. It copies elements from other animes, like bleach (the D-sword). It was a neat idea to make the main character a hardcore otaku, but it doesn't culminate into something more for him. In short this anime lacks meaning and narrative. It goes off on its own tangents, and sometimes it goes nowhere. There isn't much reason to watch this. Its mostly a generic crap anime. It would have made a better video game than an anime. If you are looking to spend money on anime there are other places you should put it.

Withing the first few episodes I quickly realized just how much of a mistake I had made. I've seen and enjoyed Steins;Gate which is another anime series from the same developer as this one however, Chaos;Head is nothing as enjoyable. The basic premise is interesting unfortunately it's execution is poor. The main villain has almost no introduction and is offered no explanation. Details are practically ignored regarding the science and it seemed like the producers tried too hard to pack all of this in. The story is rather simple and complicated at the same time, at the beginning of the series the viewer is offered no backdrop or details leaving them confused. As the series progresses the main premise becomes easier to understand but by the end were left completely dumbfounded by the lack of explanations and any sort of introduction. While the animation is top quality the story leaves much to be desired and suffers from pacing issues. This is all just my opinion on this anime, but I would not recommend this series to anyone.",1324944000,2,1214,4.758293838862559

Yeah its THAT BAD. This monstrosity Amazon.com calls an anime is the least bit stimulating, for many reasons, such as its unlikable cast, plot, and art-style that makes me want to find my original copy of the game and cling onto it for dear life. Chaos;Head was much better as a game. The game itself is average because the storyline is just so overexposed. If you are new to anime, I recommend it if you haven't a thing better to do.

. Very involved story
. Character depth is there, your always trying to work out if its reality or a delusion
. Reminds me a bit of Stiens Gate crossed with the Matrix
. Story doesn't develop as quick as i would have liked
. The idea's of the story make you think which i love however
. The subs are way to quick at times. honestly i think fan subs are done better
. The series is REGION FREE in Australia. which i was so thankful about. go Funimation and MAD House. +1 to you guys
. Dont watch the show when you have a head ache either. trust me it makes it worse
. If your a fan of a very layered story i would recommend the purchase
. Animations are beautiful, especially if you've got a nice HiDef teli. The drawings are crystal sharp
. Box art is great, disc art is great. looks fantastic on my shelf

A guy wakes up laying top of some rubble in the desolate ruins of a city with a girl putting a sword to his chest.  He doesn't seem to recognize her.  She bends down, says sorry, and kisses him.  The only thought going through his head is, ""Who's eyes are those?""  Then, the story begins.

The main character, Takumi, is a bit hard to take because he is on the extreme paranoid side of being a NEET.  He has an extreme fear of the world and everyone in it.  Even with him being an extreme coward, the story and surrounding characters manage to overcome that.  Takumi has a rather weak grip on reality that has you questioning what is really happening.  If you liked, ""Serial Experiments: Lain,"" or, ""Evangelion,"" you will probably like this one.  It isn't as dark as those, but it definitely gets a good, WTF, feel to it.
