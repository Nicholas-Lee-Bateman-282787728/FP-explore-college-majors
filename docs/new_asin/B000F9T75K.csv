8119349,3,B000F9T75K,"Three people, one who is blind, are lured to a house with the promise of a false reward. Once there, they're drugged. While they're unconscious, someone bricks them up in the house. When they wake up, they're unable to escape. Also trapped in the house with them is a deformed freak who wears one of his masks to stalk and kill the group.

This is from the same makers of RAZORTEETH, and it's an extremely cheap flick;  it's even much cheaper than RAZORTEETH. The killer in this is supposed to be so strong that he doesn't even need weapons. He tears both arms off one guy and nearly decapitates another with one powerful swing, but he's stopped in one sequence when they put a chair in front of a door! It's decently directed for a no budget flick, but the acting is terrible. It contains no interesting scenery or atmosphere, is slow moving in parts, has no nudity, and the ultra cheap budget doesn't allow for any convincing effects. It has a low body count, and none of the gore is extreme; but I still liked some of the incredibly cheap, no budget gore. I also thought that most of the soundtracks were pretty bad as well. Unless you're looking for bad no budget flick, I wouldn't recommend it.

This ultra cheap movie is shot-on-video; they used VHS. You can't expect a no budget VHS movie like this to look pristine, so don't expect it to look great. Overall, I would say the quality is good if you're comparing it to cheap flicks that are made on VHS tapes. The color, contrast, sharpness and brightness are fine for something that's so cheap and shot on VHS. There's some Ok extras as well.",1382400000,2,1599,4.469178082191781

8119351,4,B000F9T75K,"There is ""fear"" in this movie- the same fear experienced by a kid who wears a fanny pack to his first day in junior high.  You have to love the Polonias and their unique charm.  Just their recycling skills should win them an environmental award.  Nobody produces films like PBE.  Want a great night's entertainment?  Go Polonia.",1181606400,3,328,4.684210526315789
8119352,1,B000F9T75K,"Unfortunately I rented this DVD based on the cover and my appetite for slasher flicks from the 80's. This movie offered none of the above. The movie looks like it was filmed by my cousin Joe. The lines are shallow and it reminds me of the movie one had to create in order to pass ""Film Making 400"" in college. The 3 main actors (and I use that word actor loosely) are caught in a home where they are hunted by some evil monster. The 1 woman in the film has a shallow role and appears only a for a few minutes. When you finally see the monster it looks like a 3rd grader made the constume which does not bode well for the fear factor. I actually laughed when the main character is attacked by the monster. No fear in this movie...

Overall a complete waste of film and would not suggest anyone spending money or time watching it.",1159488000,,828,4.175
