4048172,5,B003156IJ8,"Since two of the three reviews thus far, wrote negative responses which really do not even pertain to THIS particular gem of a movie anyway, I wanted to briefly pass along just a bit about ""Everybody Sing,"" for those not so familiar with it.  The movie has a stellar cast, with the VERY amazing Fanny Brice, the young, and very gifted Judy Garland, Allan Jones, Billie Burke, Reginald Owen, to just name a few.  The basic storyline is that young Judy's (also her name in the movie) crazy, hilarious theatrical parents (Billie Burke, Reginald Owen) need money...and they just happen to be fortunate enough that the family's cook (Allan Jones) is actually a very gifted singer on the verge of stardom...besides their having a zany maid of Russian theatrical fame (in better days, that is) named Olga (Fanny Brice).  Judy and Allan (without her parents knowledge) decide to put on the musical of their lives, and when Olga learns of this, she too, has to join in.

And oh, did I happen to mention the (forbidden) romance between Allan and Judy's older sister yet?!!  Or Olga's long lost love Boris, from Russia who just suddenly reappears in Olga's life again?!!  Or about Judy, getting kicked out of schools because she prefers music that swings rather than classical?!!  And OMIGOSH!  I haven't EVEN touched on the musical numbers, or the amazingly funny and wonderful skits they put on in this movie!  You REALLY have got to see it!  ""Everybody Sing,"" starring Fanny Brice (in one of her VERY rare movie appearances), Allan Jones, Judy Garland, Billie Burke, Reginald Owen, Lynne Carver, Reginald Gardiner, and more is indeed a film treasure well worth seeing!",1354492800,10,1660,4.8546099290780145
4048173,4,B003156IJ8,"THIS MOVIE IS THE USUAL LATE 30'S MIX OF MUSIC AND COMEDY..TO ALL END UP WITH A HAPPY ENDING
JUDY IS AS USUAL ON TOP FORM  MUSICAL NUMBERS ARE GOOD AND THE SUPPORTING CAST ARE ON GOOD FORM TOO
NOT OFTEN SEEN,THIS IS WELL WORTH ADDING TO YOUR MUSICAL FILM COLLECTION",1306108800,2,265,4.196078431372549
4048174,1,B003156IJ8,I ordered this movie from 2 different suppliers and in each case I received a movie called Everybody Sing with Judy Garland.  Which has Fanny Brice in it but no Hedy Lamarr...,1297209600,4,175,4.46875
4048175,3,B003156IJ8,"amid tanks of fish, the actors slog thru the film. goe. brent as usual is saccharine and solicitous. hedy, well she's loverly, but her usual
undimensional self. paul lukas, who had an under-rated career, is successfully menacing and enigmatic (puzzle, puzzle, who is this ""gaslight""
husband). ""gaslight"" was a fine film, this is not necessarily that. i watched on a home theater (big screen); this one is better seen on a 21""
set (do they still make them that small?!). when all is said and done, the cliches were kinda fun.",1276041600,2,524,4.769230769230769
8386587,4,B003156IJ8,Good Movie,1516579200,,10,4.5
8386588,4,B003156IJ8,Though there is allot of hollering and screeching going on in this movie. It's just another piece of the puzzle as to what all Judy Garland's talents are. She certainly has a powerful voice for singing being a 13 year old. I needed to see exactly what all she has done prior to the Wizard of Oz. And I seen some videos of her in Carnegie hall at a much later age.,1513468800,,363,4.055555555555555
8386589,3,B003156IJ8,I'm glade they didn't fire Judy after this film.  I hope they fired the writers and producers.,1503792000,,94,4.529411764705882
8386590,1,B003156IJ8,"Very disappointed with this move.  The script is rather weak and is exacerbated by a lot of over acting.  Billie Burke virtually yells her way through the entire movie.  Judy Garland is just too young; even a year later her performance in Wizard of Oz is much, much better.  The musical numbers are unimaginative and dull.  I was hoping to see some good work by Fannie Brice, but even that was lackluster and minimal.  Allan Jones is the only bright spot in the entire production.
On a good note, the movie has been redone and is very sharp, and the sound is great as well.  It's too bad the material isn't better.",1489276800,,614,4.428571428571429
8386591,5,B003156IJ8,I added this to my Judy Garland collection. Fanny Brice was especially entertaining. Warning--Judy goes blackface. Which was acceptable in 1936. Jones is in good voice.,1470787200,2,168,5.5
8386592,5,B003156IJ8,Another great Judy Garland movie.  Add this to your collection.  This is a must for all who love the old musicals.,1417910400,3,114,4.380952380952381

8386595,5,B003156IJ8,My husband and I love  Judy Garland and this is one of her better movies. We are really glad that we were able to find it and in such great shape !!! A movie worth seeing for sure.,1382313600,2,180,3.736842105263158
8386596,5,B003156IJ8,Early Judy Garland sparkles in this light hearted swinging comedy which features Billie Burke (of Glinda fame) and the incomparable Fanny Brice. The secondary characters are engaging and funny. It's an altogether enjoyable film.,1373241600,,228,5.735294117647059
