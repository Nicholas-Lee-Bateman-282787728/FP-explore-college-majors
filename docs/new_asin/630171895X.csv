7824798,3,630171895X,"This is a depressing and odd video. I watched this years ago, it is exactly what it is titled. You will see many buildings, vehicles, and homes being blown to smithereens. This is a haunting look of the view of a bombers sights as they drop massive bombs on the people below. The music is very odd, sketchy and mortifying. It reminds me of a depressing and beat that has some upbeat action sequences. The movie is dated, raw footage.",1379376000,,433,4.425
