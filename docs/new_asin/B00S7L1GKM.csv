6963600,3,B00S7L1GKM,"From the Dark opens with an old man accidentally releasing some sort of monster that had been bound, staked and buried in the bog--after it viciously attacks him we jump earlier in time to a bickering young couple driving through rural Irish roads on a getaway.  They take a bad road and get stuck in the mud in the middle of nowhere.  The man looks for help while his girlfriend stays with the car in case somebody drives by.  When the young man finds a house he also finds the old man from the beginning of the movie--dazed and uncommunicative  and with a bloody wound on his neck.

The younger man goes back to the car to fetch his girlfriend so she can administer medical aid to the old man but the house is different when he returns, most noticeably where it was brightly lit earlier it is dark now and all the light-bulbs have been destroyed.  The old man has turned into a monster with a very strong aversion to light.

Director Michael McMahon (the horror comedy Stitches) gets a surprising amount of mileage out of a very basic idea--the couple need light in order to fend off the monster but since it destroyed everything obvious all they are left with is a small desk lamp and the flashlight app in a cell phone with a dying battery--so how do they stay alive until morning?  Do they stay in the house within the small square of light they created with the desk lamp or should they try to escape?

The monster looks more than a little like Max Schreck from Nosferatu but it isn't a vampire.  It can move so stealthily it can be behind you one second and vanish the next.  It's surprisingly agile, extremely vicious and the one weakness it has is a violent aversion to light.  Actually there are two monsters in From the Dark--the original one that was dug up and the old man who turns after being wounded but the movie largely ignores the original monster.

From the Dark generates some chills early by repeatedly putting something ominous just outside of the female character's line of vision after night has come and she is still waiting by the car.  She senses something is there and turns her head but sees nothing because it's already gone.  Then a shape turns up again behind her or off to the side but every time she looks nothing is there and she thinks it must be her imagination making her jittery.  This sequence is effectively creepy and even made me jump once.

Once the couple is trapped in the house From the Dark becomes a lot more uneven--it seems like the director is trying to pad things out because there weren't enough ideas for the second half of the movie.  From the Dark's intensity eventually flags.  The husband is seriously wounded and based on what happened to the old man from the opening scene we know there is a pretty good chance he will turn into a monster himself--but he is never able to communicate in any meaningful way after being wounded which probably wasn't a good idea since that places all of the weight of carrying the second half of the film on a single character, the girlfriend.

From the Dark has moments that are genuinely scary but it feels like a short film padded out to feature length--there are slow spots with little tension or drama.  From the Dark also never comes up with a good reason why the couple should leave the safety of their lit space before morning besides the fact that it will likely become a very dull movie if they don't--the monster does do one thing to force their hand but the sequence could have been milked for far more suspense (the monster should be able to operate pretty freely in a smoke-filled room since light won't travel far) and the girlfriend is ultimately able to reverse the situation pretty easily.

It's a shame director Conor McMahon isn't able to maintain more consistent suspense and that the second half of From the Dark becomes so hit or miss but it's still an above average chiller that's worth a look for horror fans but not likely something very many people will want to watch twice.",1428105600,4,3994,4.502770083102493

Excellent script, and, yes, the female lead is beyond amazing but I think the male lead was fantastic too (and I think that we weren't really meant to sympathize with him), beautifully shot, highly effective minimalist approach. This is an indie film, so if you walk into it thinking ""Bram Stoker"" you are going to miss the magic.

6963614,5,B00S7L1GKM,"If ever a creature of the darkness existed, this movie captures the horror of being stalked by such a monster. The lead actress is Aliens Ripley on steroids and without giving it away, she kicks ARSHE!  I loved the dark and timeliness of the realisitic time elapsed sequences, not some time machine movement. I would give this more than 5 stars. Gritty, griping, and nail biting to the climatic end. BRAVO.",1513209600,,406,4.71830985915493

The lead character and her partner , under very believable circumstances, wind out at a small farmhouse where this vampire likes to prowl about. Its a movie with a strong heroine lead roll, that was acted out very convincingly.

6963620,5,B00S7L1GKM,"Awesome. One of the best vampire flicks I've EVER seen.
Basically, a b.a. Irish woman, and her boyfriend, take on a boss vampire, and a minion vampire, with only a cell phone, a dying flashlight, a handful of matches, and a few candles (and later on, a lantern). They make some dumb mistakes (it takes her to the last match to think of starting a fire - geez) but that's expected in horror. So, it's ""make it through the night"" horror.
It's moody, claustrophobic, and unlike another reviewer, I thought the camera work was intelligently done.
It was tense, fun, and I just loved seeing a female hero.",1508803200,,600,4.564814814814815
6963621,3,B00S7L1GKM,"From The Dark is a decent effort with a certain amount of charm and enthusiasm on the part of the film crew and I was enjoying the atmospheric buildup of the film until the vampire action started. While I was ok with some very dark scenes the overabundance of the horrible shaky cam makes you feel like you are watching the original Blair Witch movie during an earthquake. I had to rewind parts several times and still couldn't tell what the hell was going on. While I understood the intent behind this choice it made for a VERY frustrating experience as someone atempting to follow the action of the film.

Its too bad toom the tale has a lot going for it, subtly pulling from Irish lore, delightfully not going out of its way to explain things with exposition and instead letting you experience events as if you were a hapless member of the cast. The lead vampire was suitably creepy (when I could make him out) and the film (when the carmera was locked down) was beautifully shot. In fact the very final moments of the confrontation between the heroine and the vampire leave you on the edge of your seat and wondering about the final outcome of this life and death struggle until the very last second.

While there is plenty I like about this film I just cant recommend it because no one should have to keep pausing and rewinding a film to figure out what is going on in a scene.",1507766400,,1382,4.415686274509804
6963622,4,B00S7L1GKM,"FROM THE DARK (2014) is an excellent, low-budget creeper from Ireland. After opening w/ a hideous resurrection and a poor old farmer being viciously attacked as a result, we are introduced to young Sarah and Mark (Niamh Algar and Stephen Cromwell). Just passing through the vast, mostly uninhabited countryside, their car gets hopelessly stuck in the mud. Not surprisingly, there's no cell phone service, so the couple ends up at the farmer's house. The farmer... isn't himself. At all. And... he disappears. Then, the pair realizes that something else is lurking about. Something ancient and very thirsty! Using their wits, Sarah and Mark find the creature's one weakness. Will this buy them time, perhaps allowing them to destroy it? The vampiric monster is reminiscent of NOSFERATU, and it's ""night vision"" is shot / used in a way that should bring a smile to fans of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

6963628,4,B00S7L1GKM,"Fun, classic little horror flick. I thought the acting was more than decent.  No CGI or over the top special effects needed for an entertaining, spooky jaunt through the bogs with a young Irish couple that are comfortable with each other and their quirks.  The creature and makeup effects were well done  The box of matches annoyed me a bit, but it was good for the tension building.  This was very nice break from the usual teens having sex and being slaughtered in the woods formula.  There were a good amount of jump scares and gore but no sex or nudity. Pop some popcorn and have a good ol' vampire/monster movie for your Saturday night rental.",1506729600,3,648,4.551724137931035
6963629,4,B00S7L1GKM,Fun little low budget horror flick. Very reminiscent of The Decent.  Small cast with a small set that relies on the skill of the filmmaker to make it good.  Worth a watch if you're into horror monster flicks.,1506729600,,208,4.447368421052632
6963630,5,B00S7L1GKM,classic,1506556800,,7,7.0
6963631,2,B00S7L1GKM,"This is an Irish film about a couple stranded in the country side, hunted by a creature that is not fond of the light. It's built on a very simple premise, but without proper execution it's easy to fall into a rut with this type of film. As far as the Irish accents, whenever one of the main characters would talk all I could think about was Warwick Davis in the Leprechaun films. After their car gets stuck because the man refused to listen to directions, he ventures off to find a farmhouse that may not be as uninhabited as it seems.
  I was a much bigger fan when the creature was more ambiguous, but once the mythos is a little more fleshed out, and it's revealed just what they're fighting, it becomes a little more underwhelming. This is a full on female empowerment film, the boyfriend is a gigantic, useless lump, that she has to carry around for a good portion of the film. Apparently any source of light harms the creature to some extent, even something as small as a match, when seems truly far fetched.
  With minimal locations the film does drag in some places, but the director does a wonderful job shooting with shadows, and playing with the darkness. The action ramps up towards the end, when it comes down to the final showdown, but even then it's pretty by the numbers stuff, and it drags on far longer than it should. It's a decent creature feature in a time where we don't get many of those, but it never over achieves.",1506470400,,1440,4.402255639097745

6963635,5,B00S7L1GKM,"Guess you have to look to Ireland now for a decent horror/monster flick. Refreshingly, this has none of the spasmodic cinematography and ""because we can"" special effects that have invaded American movies. Well done.",1506297600,2,215,5.352941176470588
6963636,4,B00S7L1GKM,"I tried to watch it once but quit, then after a couple of weeks I tried it again, and found it fun to watch if you're ready for a chill.  Monsters in the Irish countryside!  Oh my!  Not for the squeamish.  A few scenes made my skin crawl.  I found this movie one of the few of this genre that actually entertains.",1506211200,2,313,3.9838709677419355

6963638,4,B00S7L1GKM,"Good acting (the actress is excellent). Good camera work. Impressively done considering that it seems to have been low budget. I have seen movies where they spent big money, but were nowhere near as well done as this.

Be warned that there is little in the way of special effects but I liked that about it. In too many movies,the special effects become the stars of the movie and acting, camera work, p! ot, etc suffer.

Also, if you have trouble with Irish accents you may want to use closed captioning. I had no difficulty at all with the accent, though.

6963642,5,B00S7L1GKM,"This movie was a nice find, completely different from your average vampire movie. The creature has no mind, doesn't speak it's just a relentless horror from hundreds of years ago when some desperate determined peasants managed to stake it down and bury it so deep (they thought) that no one would ever stumble across it. One can only imagine how they brought such a monster down. I couldn't help but think of the bog people dug up after thousands of years, bummer if one had a stake through it's heart. The vampire still had the ill woven peasant garb it was once a human. The farmhouse was obviously very old, small doorways and somehow gave off it's own sense of creepiness.

6963644,5,B00S7L1GKM,"Horror thriller, set at night, that is so good you forget the reason why a young couple veered off the main road into danger. The actress Niamh Algar who plays the female character carries the entire show in a believable, realistic portrayal of total horror & strength to survive. The male actor/character, Mark, has nothing positive to say about; he takes them both into dangers' way, Never listening to a word his girlfriend says & She is the intelligent one. The pursuer is afraid of light, so that's what the characters use. I've never seen such fight to survive before in portrayal of the female character, while ""Mark,"" her boyfriend, cowers like a spineless fish. This movie will make you root for the heroine to escape the demon & Mark, too. I wanted her away from both & let the demon have him. The fear, scare factor was upfront the entire movie.

Tell you one thing, though, the girl in this movie is awesome! I mean, she kicks some creepy butts, and doesn't stand around wasting time screaming like one would expect. At first it looked like she was the foolish one for sitting out in that dark by herself for a long time, not noticing what was going on around her, but she proved herself to be the smarter one, and had she been the one who had come across that farmhouse first, I doubt if she would have hung around it like her idiot boyfriend did.

6963671,4,B00S7L1GKM,"I rented this movie on a lark when I was looking for a horror movie to watch.  My expectations were pretty low and I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going in, other than the box cover and the brief description.  I assumed it would be a standard b movie ""creature feature"" the likes of which are so often found on the Syfy network.  I was thus pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a much more claustrophobic and intense take on vampire mythology, driven by some fairly strong acting and excellent use of lighting.  The film eschews dialogue (save for the beginning, where the characters are established) and knows well enough to keep its monster to the shadows, only ever granting us glimpses (less is more is certainly at play here).  Thus, it relies on creating a tense atmosphere and depends on the acting of the characters to drive the terror of the situation.  The film deserves praise as it is able to achieve this atmosphere due in no small part to excellent camerawork, which highlights the contrast between light and dark and keeps us scanning the darkness for the creature's shape and features.  Also helping the film are the performances of the actors, with special praise for Niamh Algar, who manages to portray both desperation and grim determination in the situation she finds herself in.  Still, there are a few scenes that had me scratching my head at character decisions (though far far less than so many other modern horror movies) and the design of the creature can seem a little goofy (it reminded me of an Orc from The Lord of the Rings).  Still, the strengths of this film easily outweigh the weaknesses and I can give it a hardy recommendation to any fans of the genre.",1475798400,4,1708,4.647840531561462

I wouldn't say I was ""scared,"" so much as I was kept on the edge of my seat. This short film is extremely suspenseful and doesn't lean on jump scares  rather, you know the scares are coming and you're hanging on the edge of your seat, shouting at the characters to get out of there before they come.

I would recommend this, also, to anyone who is a fan of traditional vampire lore. The vampires of this short film are not the vampires of Twilight; they are not even the vampires of Dracula.

Not a leprechaun per se, but some kind of Bog Man that was unleashed from the peat bogs of Ireland (credited as ""The Creature""). After introducing the mysterious creature, we get an obligatory character development car ride of the two soon-to-be-victims, car trouble, and then the ol' low budget trick of having the film be basically one setting, a dilapidated Irish farmhouse where the light-fearing creature attacks the two protagonists. They're inside the house, now they're outside, now they're back inside, etc. The film has good cinematography, acting, lighting, and sound design, but the story itself breaks no new ground. It has a strong female heroine who goes through hell and back. Then there's a twist at the end. The end. There's no real explanation of The Creature. This movie is junk food.

Some films are able to distract from irrationality problems through various tricks, but this film doesn't succeed in that regard.  Beyond that, it is ponderous, predictable, lacking in character development, unappealing and uninteresting.

You get a quick quiz on celtic peat bog bodies.  Peat bogs,are bogs with rich mats of sphagnum moss, are fairly common in Europe, especially in Britain, Ireland and Scandinavia. Many of the bogs are thousands of years old. As the moss dies, and is replaced by new growth, the old plant matter begins to turn to peat, a thick fibrous mat that makes wonderful fuel for heating. The bog water interacts with the acids in the moss and produce tannin and other chemicals that preserve the bodies that fall or are cast into the bog; hence the numerous well-preserved bog bodies. From a Celtic point of view, the most interesting bodies are those that are a thousand or more years old. But if you find one with a stake in it leave it. It might be there for a reason.

Sure, the literal darkness makes it tough to see what's going on but this is a vampire who is afraid only of light... much scarier to be in the dark than in the light so it just ratchets up the intensity.  The woman is not your stereotypical, whimper and scream and trip her way through the movie needing to be saved by the boyfriend at the crucial moment.  The boyfriend isn't exactly weak either, just less lucky.  The vampire is more creature like than we've seen in a long time due to the popularity of young, sexy vampires in the U.S.  I much prefer this Nosferatu style creature myself.  As for the bad, it didn't even deter from my enjoyment enough to remove a star but the ending gets a bit clunky and the character makes a few choices I would not have.  That's it.

A real mood setter, occurring in one night, in the dark, ramps up the tension and fear these 2 people experience throughout this movie.
The unseen is as much a terror as what you barely see happening behind their backs and in the unseen areas behind the actors. A farmer opens up what can be reasoned to be the grave of a vampire from a patch of sod in the jolly countryside of Ireland.
In steps a young couple and the terror soon begins, as their car gets stuck in the mud. Excellent continuity throughout the movie, with viewpoint, of what the creature, or HOW the creature is seeing his victims.
A great heroine actress is born portrayed by Niamh Algar. She does what it takes and then some...my kudos to her ability to act.

6963717,4,B00S7L1GKM,"From the Dark is a single location horror film from Irish writer/director Conor McMahon (Stitches). Set in the Irish countryside the premise is simple enough:

Unaware of the fact that digging holes on Irish farms is an extremely dangerous activity to engage in, a farmer (Gerry OBrien) discovers a body while digging a hole on his Irish farm. The body turns out not to be dead (but rather undead) and shenanigans ensue. Meanwhile a young couple (Niamh Algar and Stephen Cromwell) out for holiday happen to wander into the wrong place after their car gets stuck in the mud. From there its simply a matter of survival for the couple while the creature stalks them throughout the night. We learn quickly the monster is allergic to light of any kind (the brighter the better), then watch as the couple try to figure a way off the farm with what little illumination they can find.

The reviews Ive seen online focus on the limited scope and simplicity as reasons for disappointment. The general consensus is that From the Dark takes a basic horror plot and does almost nothing with it, leaving audiences underwhelmed and frustrated.

I disagree. From the Darks simplicity turns out to be a hidden strength. McMahon keeps a nice steady pace throughout the film, never letting it drag but also never rushing too quickly from one scene to the next. The film is shot almost entirely at night making it a dark film on screen which works well to set the atmosphere and environment through which the creature lurks in and out of the shadows. A technique I rather enjoyed. Not seeing the monster up close, but rather outlined in the background keeps the focus on the couple and their ordeal. As a viewer it helps create a feeling that you're standing next to the couple, trapped in the same situation.

The monster (which may or may not be a vampire) looks very familiar. Most genre fans will see some resemblance, especially when its hands splay outward from its hips, long nail-like claws glowing in the moonlight. Its creepy and fun.

So why are the reviews online lukewarm to crapfest? I have no idea but Ill speculate. Horror film fans and critics can be ruthless when it comes to critical analysis of the genre. Genre fans understand that most horror films are formulaic or derivative so they look for uniqueness, style and over-the-top antics to set one film apart from its predecessors. Makers of horror films know this and often get caught up in trying to set their movie apart and forget the basics. I feel for the filmmakers. Its difficult to create original spin on rehashed ideas but fans hope for that each time a new slasher, zombie, monster, murder, mayhem, creature feature film gets released. This is why From the Dark deserves a lot of credit. McMahon doesnt do anything flashy. Doesnt throw in a twist for shock value. Doesnt worry about backstory, exposition or details. He focuses in on the nuts and bolts of what makes good horror good horror  simplicity.",1433894400,2,2966,4.738372093023256

6963727,4,B00S7L1GKM,"Irish horror film begins in the rural countryside where a farmer (Gerry OBrien) is doing an excavation and unearths what appears to to be the corpse of something humanoid buried beneath the ground. It proves to be not quite dead and attacks him. At the same time young couple Sarah (Niamh Algar) and Mark (Stephen Cromwell) are traveling through the area and run into car trouble. As fate would have it, they arrive at the farmers home to seek help and encounter the man with a severe neck wound and acting strangely. The farmer isn't their only problem, though, as something else is out there in the dark nightsomething with a thirst for human blood.

Conor McMahons last film was the 2012 clown horror/comedy Stitches but, here he goes for a completely serious approach as he tells his Irish vampire story. He generates some nice tension and suspense, especially when using a plot device dealing with the creatures aversion to lightof which there is a lack of. There is some nice atmosphere and McMahon gives it a deliberately smoldering pace which works very well in maintaining the mood. There is plenty of action and more than adequate blood spilling and we also get a fiery and resourceful heroine from Algars Sarah, who has to battle the creature once Mark is badly wounded early on. Its a small film and true, some scenes could have used more impact but, otherwise this is a fresh twist on the time-worn vampire story and a case where the ambiguity of our blood sucking fiend works very well for it. The Nosferatu-like creature (Ged Murray) is effective and kept in shadow and there is a tense cat and mouse game between it and Sarah for the last act. McMahon also establishes Sarah and Marks relationship and character very quickly which helps us sympathize and empathize with them throughout the story. There is some crisp cinematography and good use of the remote Irish locations by Michael Lavelle and a spooky score by Ray Harman to add to the film overall. A solid little horror.

I liked this little movie. It could have used a bit more intensity at times but, the minimalist approach worked very well in maintaining a subtle creepiness and the scenes of full-on horror are very effective. Its atmospheric and manages to add a few small fresh twists to vampire lore while delivering the bloodshed and suspenseful action expected. Niamh Algar makes for a very endearing and feisty heroine and our creature is effectively vicious and mysterious. A good little horror that goes for a smaller, more intimate story in an age of bombastic FX overkill. Recommended.",1432339200,2,2573,4.792792792792793

6963735,3,B00S7L1GKM,"I'm not sure if this is a new take on the vampire or werewolf mythos. The opening reminded me of Rawhead Rex.  Either way, it's a decent movie about a couple who get lost on the countryside at night. The car is stuck and they go looking for help but encounter something that is preying on them.  Whatever it is, it cannot tolerate light of any type. Do they survive the night?  Or do they become dinner?  It's worth watching.",1431216000,6,425,4.275
6963736,5,B00S7L1GKM,"This film I rate up there with ""30 of Night"", ""Let The Right One In"" and Nosferatu for originality , storyline and pure creep factor. This is a dark film both in the sense of gothic theme and technical lighting, masterfully executed in all areas. The director really did his homework on this one, there are many past film styles all wrapped into one fantastically original piece. Was on edge of my seat throughout.. .",1430956800,8,417,4.573333333333333

6963738,4,B00S7L1GKM,"spoiler alert!!!! A little different take on the old theme of vampires. The aspect of this movie I liked the best was the 'creep factor'. Normally I detest movies filmed mostly in the dark, but it really worked for this one!! Shadowy figures passing by in the back round, many 'jump' moments created by elements of anticipation, coupled with a general feeling of dread. My kind of movie!! Very little actual violence in this one. The ""monster"" was shown mostly in shadow which was incredibly creepy. The deviation from the traditional vampire characteristics was playing fast and loose with what I consider to be the standard for vampires. If you choose to watch this one, you will see what I mean. That being said, it takes a lot to impress me these days with any horror movie since it's mostly all been done before. But this one was an unexpected exception!! If you're looking for a dark (literally and figuratively) new take on a vampire movie, I think this one fits the bill!!!",1430784000,11,981,4.676300578034682
6963739,3,B00S7L1GKM,"Film to dark, could not get a clear view of actors, I know the creature was scared of light, and darkness was essential, but Actors must be seen, I think it could have been produced a better way.",1430697600,5,195,4.157894736842105
6963740,5,B00S7L1GKM,"Irish horror story, which is a modern take on the German classic expressionist horror Nosferatu (1922).  The action of the film takes place in rural Ireland.  A young couple experiences car trouble so the guy decides to seek help in a near by countryside house.  But instead of finding help, inside the house he runs into a man who looks sick, is bleeding from his neck, and is acting strange.  By now it is getting late and is already dark outside, the guy goes back to get his girlfriend who is watching over the car when out of nowhere the two of them get attacked by a mysterious creature...soon the two find themselves finding off blood thirsty monster who is afraid of light with everything they have and find inside the house (cell-phone light, flash-lights, candles, troche, etc.)...will they be able to survive the night? watch and find out.

The film includes:

-few good jump scares
-a scene where a character smashes his teeth out on the bathtub ridge
-a scene where a character chops off its own finger
-scary atmosphere throughout the entire film

By the way, the picture on the cover of the DVD depicts the last scene, when the girl is crawling through mud-deep open grave in search of the car...",1430265600,4,1211,4.630841121495327
6963741,4,B00S7L1GKM,a really engaging and creepy sorta vampire (or something) movie with excellent performances and direction.

6963746,4,B00S7L1GKM,"The film opens a man (Gerry O'Brien) excavating a site in the wilds of Offaly County Ireland. He pulls a stake out of the ground with expected results. Enter our couple Mark (Stephen Cromwell) and Sarah (Niamh Algar) made to look like Jennifer Lawrence. Lost, stuck in the mud while using a cell phone GPS, they happen into this same area with a game of cat/mouse and hide and seek ensue for the next hour.

Yes we have seen this type of thing play out a 1,000 times in slasher film. In this case it is a light sensitive vampire, I mean another reason to buy an I-Phone sensitive. It made the film different and a bit unreasonable. The writers made the hide and seek part interesting in what is typically a mundane aspect of a film. Niamh Algar did a good job with this low budget production. The sound track of deep oboe music coupled with some things jumping in the dark created a decent scare factor.

This is not a block buster horror film but should make an excellent rental.

Guide: A few F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1429401600,8,1021,4.363157894736842
6963747,4,B00S7L1GKM,"From the Dark is an interesting take on the vampire mythology. Going with vampires as a monster, From the Dark makes effective use of corner of the eye movements and creepy surrounding to craft an eerie atmosphere. While a small film, it looks great and has solid sound and music. I am a fan of trapped/siege stories and found From the Dark to be a solid film in that type of story. On top of the vampire and the trapped, survive until dawn elements, the use and importance of light all lend themselves to effectively telling a unique vampire story. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film and recommend it to others. Do not let the somewhat bad cover art dissuade you from getting or at least renting this movie.",1429315200,17,732,4.470149253731344

6963750,4,B00S7L1GKM,"This film revolves around a couple who's car breaks down along the Irish countryside ,who then stumble upon an old farmhouse that leaves much to be desired in the lighting department.

In a flashback the farmhouse owner has exumed some sort of undead creature who then starts stalking them. The creature is really creepy even though we never get a really good look at him except for a couple of shadowy face shots. His figure, presense and sound are quite frightening .

It seems the only thing he is frightened of is light and the couple have very little except a dying flashlight, cellphone, one lamp in the farmhouse and some candles. There is some nicely done gore but not a lot ,also the lighting in the film is nicely done but some things are meant to be hard to see or left to one's imagination.

I won't give anything else  away as not to spoil .I found it to be fast moving and attention keeping even making me wince and clutch my pearls a few times. (Niamh Algar) as Sarah was perfect and Sarah is one tough chick!",1429056000,4,1024,4.402116402116402

Overall, I felt that this movie was ""all bark and no bite"". I am honestly not sure if it was supposed to be scary or not, but it was not scary to me. That, however, did not really impact my opinion of the film. I mostly took away stars because it did not hold my interest very well. Although I personally did not enjoy this movie, I definitely think that any enthusiast could really like it!  Some movies are just poorly made, or have horrid story lines, etc., but this one was pretty well made, just was not my cup of tea.",1521763200,,708,4.323308270676692
8697524,5,B00S7L1GKM,"I really enjoyed this movie. Niamh Algar shines as the movie's protagonist heroine, as her character evolves from victim to strength. The plot is simple, and this is exactly how you execute a low-budget horror movie. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I'll just say that this is not your traditional vampire movie. Vampire movies have been done to death, and they usually range from outright tacky to completely silly. The movie doesn't give a lot away, and it's kind of refreshing. No dramatic backstory, no scenery shifting from city to city, no absurd romantic subplots, no whacky, poorly-timed comedic moments. The entire movie takes place within one night, from rural building to building, and it maintains a firm yet not overwhelming sense of suspense within the entire last hour of the movie. Pacing in a movie is one of those things that people don't often think about yet results in a person disliking a movie and not being able to figure out why. The pacing here is spot on.

As a long-time horror movie fan, this is one of those gems that I didn't even know existed and now I can't believe that I hadn't found before today.",1520726400,,1143,4.658415841584159

All the running around was just filler and boring. Sorry :) It is worth a watch if you have nothing else to do. I recommend that you get with a few friends get baked and yell at the screen haha...",1519862400,,428,4.107142857142857
