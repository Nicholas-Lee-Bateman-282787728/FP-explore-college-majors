8143681,5,B000I2J6UU,"After the 4th and last volume, starring Huey, Dewey and Louie, the Funny Factory collection stopped here; it would've been great to see more volumes with Chip 'n' Dale, Ranger Woodlore and Humphrey the bear, and even Pluto. This disc starts out with the nephews' animated debut, Donald's Nephews from 1938, and there's 7 more shorts afterward, where they make life for their Uncle Donald a living nightmare, or just trying to save his skin from certain doom. Conclude the Funny Factory collection with volume 4 today; this and volume 3 had a bunch of gag-filled Easter eggs on their main menus, but no chattering-teeth racing game, unfortunately. They also have Retromercials (now-old sneak peeks or commercials) at the end of the shorts, via Fastplay. Nothing like brotherly love to drive your uncle crazy, wouldn't you say?",1431302400,,825,5.029197080291971

8143685,5,B000I2J6UU,"My kids (ages 5 and 3) love these cartoons! Nowdays it seems like there are too much chatter and every kid show is trying to be ""educational."" Boring!
This one is a classic, a lot of action and good music. Wish they would make cartoons like this again!",1355788800,3,252,4.270833333333333

8143687,5,B000I2J6UU,"I was so pleased when this dvd arrived so quickly and in excellent condition.  I wanted to introduce my grandson to cartoons I grew up watching.  Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey and Louie were one of my favorites and is fast becoming one of my grandson's favorites.  He wants to watch them everytime he comes.  He's fasinated by it and he's only 18 months!  This dvd holds his attention throughout the whole length of the dvd.  You can't go wrong here, if you're looking for Donald, Huey, Dewey and Louie!",1284163200,2,501,4.511111111111111
8143688,4,B000I2J6UU,"Like most of these single disc mini compilations of Disney Cartoons you get only 8 cartoons, half of which have already been released on DVD. Most of the other half will be released on December 11 2007 as a Disney Treasure DVD.  At $14.99 it is no bargain for a DVD less than an hour long, this is the equivilant of spending $30 for a short feature or $45 for a regular feature with extras.

The picture quality is excellent with supurb colors and sharp picture.  Purists may complain about the white dust on the animation cells that is usually taken out on the Disney Treasures DVD releases, but this is the way they were shown in the theaters 50 or so years ago.  The audio is crisp and flawless in its original mono mix.

The following 4 titles are NEW to DVD and won't be released on a Disney Treasures Tin DVD until Christmas 2007 or later.

STRAIGHT SHOOTERS (1947) - Donald runs a shooting gallery at a fair and tries to take advantage of Huey, Dewey & Louie.  But he has meet his match.  *** Announced to be on the December 11 2007 DISNEY TREASURES CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD 3 DVD release ***

SOUPS ON  (1948) - Donald tries to get Huey, Dewey & Louie to eat their food.  *** Announced to be on the December 11 2007 DISNEY TREASURES CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD 3 DVD release ***

LION AROUND  (1950) - The boys dress up as a lion to steal a pie from Donald's cabin. Then a real lion shows up, but Donald thinks it is the boys.  *** Announced to be on the December 11 2007 DISNEY TREASURES CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD 3 DVD release ***

LUCKY NUMBER  (1951) - Donald has the winning sweapstakes ticket & doesn't know it, the boys try to get it cash it in for him but don't have gas money for their car.  Huey, Dewey & Louie appear more as older teenagers to make them driving age.  Possibly the only Disney characters to grow up.

The following 4 titles have been released on DVD before, but you may not have those DVDs.

DONALD'S NEPHEWS  (1938) previously released on ""DISNEY TREASURES: CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD VOLUME 1"".

SEA SCOUTS  (1939) previously released on ""DISNEY TREASURES: CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD VOLUME 1"".

DONALD'S OFF DAY  (1944) previously released on ""DISNEY TREASURES: CHRONOLOGICAL DONALD VOLUME 2"".

DON'S FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH  (1953) previously released as an extra on the ""THREE CABALLEROS"" DVD.

Sadly, there are still 3 Huey, Dewey & Louie cartoons not available on DVD and they could have been included here instead of the 4 re-issues.

The bottom line is that this is a fun, good looking DVD. But it is too short and half of it is duplication.  If you don't mind paying $14.99 for 25 minutes of new cartoons than will most likely be released next year on a larger cartoon collection, then this is worth getting.  I bought it.",1164153600,18,2733,4.516326530612245
