8419477,5,B0049VZFOW,I rated this a 5 because everything worked out perfect for me.  It was an interesting video that went well with my lessons plans for the day.  I received the video quickly so I could preview it and write up a study guide with answers for the substitute.  I also loved the price.,1365120000,,278,4.2075471698113205
