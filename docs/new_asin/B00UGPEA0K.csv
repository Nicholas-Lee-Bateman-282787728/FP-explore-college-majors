8706192,3,B00UGPEA0K,This is a funny film about a super hero with no powers. The film is about an inventor who creates a bullet proof costume and decides to fight crime. This film is silly and it offers a few laughs. It will appeal to fans of Damon Wayans. I like the idea of a hero with no powers. Darryl Walker our hero is  just a very smart man who wants to fight crime. Grier plays his brother and sidekick. It's always nice to see African American men depicted as heroes and not criminals. Recommended for fans of sketch comedy.,1517875200,,512,4.224489795918367
