2138020,5,B0002XVSDI,"The DVD, Building Big Bridges kept my attention thoughout the show. The lesson plans at the end are great for any teacher wanting to teach  Engineering Bridges. You can introduce a lesson for one day or carry it over for a period of two weeks with the information given.",1215129600,7,270,4.510204081632653
2138021,3,B0002XVSDI,"Humans are really impressive.  We reached the Americas more than 10,000 years ago.  We built the pyramids and the Hoover Dam.  We've cured a huge number of diseases.  And this documentary shows how impressive it is that we found ways to build huge bridges.

Unlike many documentaries that ground all things in Ancient Egypt or the Renaissance, this documentary mentioned Roman bridges and then jumped to the 1800s.  (It's a bit Eurocentric in that Incan bridges and bridges from other cultures don't come up.)  I learned that ""compression"" is the opposite of ""tension.""  Gustave Eiffel not only built his Tower, but he built an important bridge as well.

For American history enthusiasts, this goes into many facts about the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges.  This may really inspire young students who want to become engineers or architects.",1196812800,6,842,5.08029197080292
8034356,5,B0002XVSDI,"This DVD makes learning fun. It packs a lot into an hour. What I like about it is that the concepts are explained in layman's terms, but it doesn't feel dumbed-down. I also liked that the host actually went to the sites instead of just showing pictures on a screen. My only regret is that this DVD wasn't longer- I wish there was at least another half hour.",1516492800,,357,4.264705882352941
8034357,5,B0002XVSDI,Thought I was getting a book. I guess I need to read the fine print next time,1494633600,,77,3.588235294117647
8034358,5,B0002XVSDI,Great!,1447372800,,6,6.0
8034359,5,B0002XVSDI,A great book for kids at school; however a little immature for my 3rd+ graders.,1415318400,,79,4.333333333333333
8034360,5,B0002XVSDI,Macaulay's book is interesting and beautiful! We gave it for a birthday present .  It arrived on time and everyone loved the book.  We are in love with Bridges and this fits the bill for  youngsters and adults as well.,1396310400,,218,4.4
8034361,5,B0002XVSDI,"I bought the book and then the DVD.  This review was first written about the book not realizing it was meant for the DVD.

The DVD was helpful! especially having read the book.  The DVD is only about bridges, whereas the book covers more building structures.

I recommend both.

With several illustration and diagrams, the book educates the reader in understanding how engineers design and built bridges, dams, etc.  The author takes the complexities of building and manages to write in a way that a young adult can understand it.

The above paragraph is about the book but could also pertain to the DVD.",1391385600,,604,4.75
8034362,4,B0002XVSDI,"I bought the DVD for a couple of little boys, one of whom is a very smart 7 year old now showing a bit of engineering interest and aptitude.  Well, the DVD is certainly interesting, but I decided not to give it to him (and his younger brother) because the program starts off with a catastrophe ending in death, and then throughout the movie there are several more construction fatalities.  If the kids were in junior high school, I wouldn't have any reservations, but for these kids, I decided they're not ready for this many details about men losing their lives -- and rather horrifyingly, too.",1349136000,12,595,4.60377358490566
8034363,5,B0002XVSDI,"Being a bridge engineer myself (among other things), I approached this program with some skepticism, expecting to find many annoying weaknesses.  So I'm pleased to report that my worry was unfounded - they did an outstanding job with this!

No, this isn't an introduction to bridge engineering for a lay audience, but they still effectively present various types of bridges, their range of applicability, and the often formidable challenges involved in bringing these bridges into existence, progressing through planning, funding, design, construction, inspection, and maintenance.  It's no coincidence that bridges are often featured as iconic symbols of technical achievement, and this program succeeds in showing us why.

Highly recommended for the whole family.",1337212800,10,765,5.743362831858407
8034364,5,B0002XVSDI,This DVD was suggested by one of my 7th grade students. It is outstanding and I've enjoyed it very much.,1335139200,,104,4.25
8034365,5,B0002XVSDI,"The first in the five-part series by David Macaulay, Bridges begins with the story of a bridge collapse. David then covers the evolution of bridges from primitive wooden structures to stone (many still stand) to cast iron, steel, and suspension cables. Well covered is the difficulty in building the Brooklyn Bridge when the bends was first discovered from the pressures involved. Other subjects in this series are Tunnels, Domes, Dams, and Sky Scrapers. David Macaulay explains everything so well and this episode bridged the gaps in my understanding of the subject.",1282694400,14,567,5.241758241758242
