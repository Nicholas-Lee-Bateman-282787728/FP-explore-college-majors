4705488,5,B005HVWWB2,I highly recommaend getting this series. It has a series of stories and the series hero walks thru these stories trying to solve problems that the persons in the stories face. It does have some story tie ins but almost all the stories would stand on their own without being tied to any of the other stories. Highly suggest getting this!,1332720000,,336,4.524590163934426
4705489,4,B005HVWWB2,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first watched this anime but I quickly fell in love with the animation, music and stories.  I found it to be very low key and strangely soothing to watch after a stressful day at work. And I liked how each story could stand on its own, yet still be connected as Ginko's journey continued. Really enjoyed how the ""flashback"" stories were woven in - made for a rather unique ending. Highly recommend it if you want a break from the flashy, fast paced, hyper-active anime.",1329955200,12,505,4.43010752688172
4705490,5,B005HVWWB2,"Mushi-shi is a beautiful animated series with each episode holding its own individual story.  The connector for most of the episodes is the character of Ginko - the mushi master.  He travels about helping people understand or deal with the mushi and the effects they have on their surroundings.  I very much enjoy watching these before bed - the series is perfect for a bed time story because it inspires the imagination and a person's sense of the unbelievable ^_^  If you enjoy well-told stories, you would most definitely enjoy this ^_^",1329091200,,539,4.826086956521739
4705491,5,B005HVWWB2,"This anime is really worth the buy, the scenes are beautifully colored and the plot is not overly in your face. It has a quieter feel to it. The main character is a sort of traveling medicine man, helping people who suffer from mushishi a magical type creature that take many forms through the series causing trouble each episode. The whole tone of the series is very relaxing and each episode is wonderfully more interesting than the next.",1327795200,,440,4.653846153846154
4705492,5,B005HVWWB2,"I wanted ""Mushi-shi"" for my collection for a very long time. I finally bought it,watched it and I wasn't disappointed. It starts a bit slow,but as the episodes progress,it gets better and better. Such an original concept! Some of the stories have happy ending and some are very heart breaking. But you can't help not loving them all...",1327622400,3,335,4.793103448275862
4705493,5,B005HVWWB2,"Ginko is a Mushishi - an expert on Mushi, odd spirit-like creatures not everyone can see and that occasionally cause harm to unwary humans. Ginko travels Japan studying Mushi and helping solve problems related to them, such as a village paralyzed by rust mushi, or a bamboo mushi that traps travelers in its forest. Each episode stands on its own, telling of a different place with different mushi, with Ginko observing and assisting when needed.

This is a very languid, beautiful series. Ginko does have a backstory that is eventually revealed, but the series focus is individual episodes. The scenery and mushi combine to create a delightful viewing experience, and the stories are engaging, quickly drawing you in to the world they create. Watching this show made me feel relaxed and I came away from each episode with a contented, peaceful feeling. Not that the stories are boring - since Ginko is a healer-like character, most of the stories involve people who are suffering from their contact with the mushi. But the resolutions are normally uplifting and satisfying.

If you are looking for an action show, this is not it. If you are looking for a show that has an continues storyline, this is also not it. But if you want a show that you can just watch and enjoy on an episodic basis, that has emotional stories and beautiful scenery, please give this show a try. So far everyone I've showed this series to has enjoyed it, and I hope you will too!

Random Trivia: ""Mushi"" is the Japanese word for ""bug"", which is what the mushi of this show often resemble.",1326931200,38,1565,4.725274725274725
4705499,5,B005HVWWB2,"This show is incomparable to anything else really. The closest I can get when I try to explain it to people is the Twilight Zone... But only because of the unexpected twists they both have in common.

I'm not a huge anime fan, but I enjoy the adult swim classics for the most part. This is some next level enjoyment for me however. I was and am consistently amazed by this show. It's not something I recommend binge watching, rather something you should take one at a time and really consider before moving along. The art is beautiful and the dub is really nice (I tend to prefer subs but the English voice track is very good). Even the intro song is absolutely perfect for this show.

I really can't praise this show as highly as it deserves. I recommend it every chance I get.

Oh, and you can reverse the cover so you don't have that big ugly neon green saver on the spine. Thank God.",1511827200,,887,4.299401197604791

It's a delightful little series that encapsulates a feeling of ease, beauty, appreciation and finesse.  I can't really put my finger on it, exactly, and i'm sure there is a word for it in another language, like the way ""umami"" is used in food.  Everything about this series is beautiful.  The imagery, the deliberate  stillness, the attention to detail and scenery as found in other fine anime. And the stories are so wonderful.

4705523,5,B005HVWWB2,"So much to like about this show. I believe I'm up to my 5th or 6th viewing, and I still notice new things to like and think about that I hadn't noticed before. In some ways, this anime is simple and straightforward. In other ways, complex and philosophical. It's for the most part quiet and subtle, but there is action and suspense, and the concept, themes and issues raised will make you think. The nature of the mushi, their ""rights,"" the situations of the people affected by them, what's right and wrong, what falls into a gray area, if there is no truly right outcome.

I love the animation style. It's nothing flashy, but beautiful, and perfectly suits the story. ""Flashy"" would be incongruent with this show, and this is one  of those series where nothing seems incongruent, where everything seems cohesive. The artwork, the music, the settings, the story, the characters...all so well-done and complementary to one another.

The concept is unique, as well as the execution. I've never seen another anime quite like it, although IMO it is reminiscent of Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli in the art style, the focus on nature/environment, the subtlety...but it takes a darker tone than most things by Miyazaki/Ghibli. I don't know if Mushi-shi in its entirety could be classified as horror, but some episodes definitely could. There are a few fairly creepy scenes and themes, but nothing in the way of gore-fest, ultra-violent or anything of that nature. More the psychological sort of creepiness.

Ginko is a great character, and a true main character, focused on the vast majority of the time. He gives the impression that he's seen so much strangeness, there isn't much that phases him. Definitely not a hysterical type, but still take-charge and competent. I like that he's not portrayed as a perfect hero. I'm not sure if he'd be considered a hero at all, although he does help a lot of people, and he's willing to put himself at risk to do it. He does make mistakes and question himself, but doesn't get angsty about it. He's really straightforward, sometimes brutally honest. I like that he's developed enough and his backstory is shared enough to get a feel for who he is, but he still remains somewhat of an enigma.

I don't really have any ""cons"" to list about Mushi-shi. My only complaint is that there isn't a 3rd season. And 4th. And 5th. And onward. If it would keep being produced, I'd keep watching it, and I'll keep re-watching what's available.

Highly recommended. I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could. I've watched *a lot* of anime, and Mushi-shi is one of the best I've ever seen.",1489276800,,2600,4.753880266075388

My friends and family love this show because no matter what episode you watch, it has something new and interesting to offer the watcher. I have seen this show many times and I just had to buy it. I recommend this to any anime fan that wants to watch something out of the ordinary.

The S.A.V.E. set is always a great way to buy shows at an amazing price. While it is only DVD, the show is still enjoyable and visually pleasing.",1446249600,2,705,4.587301587301587
4705562,4,B005HVWWB2,"Mushishi is probably one of the best anime series I've seen in quite a while with it's peaceful vibe, beautiful scenery, and simple yet great art. It was even adapted into a live action movie directed by the legendary author Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira, Domu: A Child's Dream).

Mushishi provides you with an interesting story that delves deeper into the world of mushi, strange bacteria like organisms that exceed flora and fauna. It is a monster of the week style but that doesn't make it boring or repetitive it just makes you more interested. It doesn't actually go into the past of the main character a mushishi (an expert on mushi) Ginko until the second season (Mushishi: The Next Passage) which isn't included in this DVD set.

The art is simple and very beautiful. They didn't try to do too much with the character designs but it had great outdoor scenery with luscious green forests with some great folksy music that matches with it's outdoorsy feel.

It's plain and simple, Mushishi is a breath of fresh air in the world of anime and if you want a great show to watch here it is.",1446163200,,1085,4.61139896373057

4705574,5,B005HVWWB2,"A great series with an excellent english dub. This set contains the entire 2006 series, and leaves you wanting more. The sequel series, Mushishi Zoku Shou doesn't have an english dub yet, although I hope that Travis Willingham comes back to voice Ginko, the anime's titular character, a Mushishi. The episodic setup of Mushishi is very different from much of what is seen in anime, as there is never a major plot tieing episodes together. Ginko is the only character who we see in every episode, with only a few appearing in more than one episode (including the sequel series), and he is nearly as mysterious as the Mushi he makes his living through. His backstory is gradually drawn out throughout the series, but it is done in a way that you can veiw these episodes in any order.
The Mushi, a form of life unlike the flora and fauna we see every day, are invisible to most, and can often have dissasterous effect on the life around them. As Ginko travels about classical Japan, he helps people who suffer from the Mushi, but stresses that the Mushi are not evil.

4705576,5,B005HVWWB2,"This is probably one of the best animes of our time. Mush-Shi follows the adventures of a man who travels around and interacts with different people. His main goal is to help those that are troubled by mushi, basically micro-organisms, or to study them. The show is very episodic in that you can watch any one episode and not need to worry about knowing anything ahead of time. Also it has a very melancholy vibe. Often the atmosphere is very quiet with a slight bit of pessimism, or some would say realism. And end on a note that often makes you wonder if what the main character, Ginko, did was actually helpful. Human nature also appears to be a big theme with this show. Many times it would appear the mushi appeared or impacted someone due to their own errors.
It's a great show that would appeal to many people and give them something different.",1443744000,,851,4.496774193548387

There is no violence, even though I'm not adverse to action films myself. It is so imaginative and flowing in it's story telling it's almost hypnotic. I first saw the series on ***flix and then was desperate to find it when they moved to the disc only library. I decided to buy it. There are other packages for buying this which I don't understand.

Travis Willingham is said to be out of his element for voice talent (he voices The Hulk in the Super Hero Squad and Thor ing the Lego ""Overload"" 30min Super hero flick. But I can't imagine a better Voice for the role of Ginko.

4705591,5,B005HVWWB2,"This series is greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeat, and so was the value of this box set!... hence the ""S.A.V.E."", lol. High quality all around... and I just found out the cover is reversible! That's the icing on the cake. Highly recommended!

As for a brief review of the anime itself, it's incredibly Eastern in its views, and the combination of smooth, simple animation (with the characters, anyway, and complex with how it depicts nature, which is excellent) and fantastically told stories (that don't always end well for the characters involved) makes for an incredibly unique, sensory experience unlike any other. Ginko really is just a wanderer who goes around and attempts to get people to be at peace with Mushi, and by extension, nature itself. I love it.

The episodes are entirely episodic, and usually 100% self-contained... with a couple exceptions. It also jumps around tonally from episode to episode. You could go from a fairly straightforward love story in one episode, to a straight-up horror experience the next. But the thing to remember is that EVERY episode is amazingly written, and accomplishes what it sets out to do.

In summary, I would HIGHLY recommend this, but caution you to look into other reviews and such before viewing it yourself. As someone who knows quality when I see it, you can trust me when I say that the less you know going into this series, the better. If you want a taste of what you're in for, look up the terrific soundtrack. It'll give you a feel for what you're in for, which is really an unforgettable anime.",1428710400,10,1544,4.818867924528302

4705616,5,B005HVWWB2,"I had been contemplating for the longest time whether I wanted to buy this or not, but I finally caved because this anime is just beautiful and chilling. It's episodic, but you will find that some stories stick with you until the end credits and you feel chilled to the bone either with a bittersweet feeling, sadness, or perhaps even hope. Mushishi shows us human interactions with the mushi and how at times it can lead to pain or to hope and salvation. The imagery of the plant life is beautiful and our main character Ginko also has a story to tell. ;)

Definitely something that you can watch time and again and still gain deep meaning from each story.",1426982400,,657,4.475

There's only four discs, and lots of episodes on each one which is what I really love about this particular set-up. I'd highly recommend this to anybody who hates changing discs.",1422057600,,492,4.406593406593407

**Addition**
Just want to add that the mushi are not ghosts, as some reviewers have called them. They have never been human, and are very much alive. They are even described as the purest forms of life. I can understand them being compared to ghosts, as only a few can see them, and some are spirit-like, but they are definitely not the same.",1420416000,2,467,4.367816091954023

The soundtrack is, overall, laidback and appreciative of the space between notes. This is a wonderful counter from the often mad-cap habits of the anime that make it to the US. It certainly has its share of weird, crazy, and funny, but the overall context is more reflective and mindful than the average US-released anime. Also mildly creepy at times, but I found not overly so. Enjoy!",1405296000,4,545,4.747368421052632

Gorgeous character study that with subtle painful and poetic stories.  Definitely for the lover of anime and Nickelodeon's Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics (remember that from the late 80's & early 90's on Sunday afternoon?), and David the Gnome.

The artwork, stories, music... everything comes together so well. It had some great extra features as well, including interviews with the Japanese director and staff members.

I can't wait for the second season that is set to air in Japan on April 5th! Hopefully it gets licensed and we get another quality dvd release (or better yet, a blu ray set!)",1395532800,,472,4.552941176470588
4705693,3,B005HVWWB2,"I ordered this back in December, having seen this show on Netflix back when it was up, I knew I was a huge fan and since they took it down I decided I needed to own it.  As luck would have it Amazon was offering this under their S.A.V.E. deal which is great.  I've seen it around a dozen times through and as far as animes go it's pretty good, not for everyone, but pretty good.  If you're into over-arcing storylines and each episode serving a purpose to the overall plot....this anime probably isn't for you.  Each episode is it's own entity and the entire series can be watched in almost any order, even the last episode just ends like any other episode, so if you're hoping for some huge plot twist, or some since of closure/wrap-up you're definitely going to be disappointed.  Besides that however, the show is very unique and interesting, each episode is almost like a mystery where the main character tries to find out what ails the characters and normally doesn't find out until the very end, but take my word for it that description doesn't do the show justice.

That being said the show I would probably give it a 4/5 stars because, unfortunately for me, I liked it but I do like my deep intricate plots that are constant thoughout a show.  However, the reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because when I got this in mail I opened up the DVD case to find that all but one of the plastic pieces, that keep the DVD cases from moving around in the box, were broken.  The DVDs still stay where they're supposed to, but if I were to shake the DVD case for any reason the holder will slide right out, and even with the case open I can barely tug on it and they slide right out.  Most of the time Amazon is pretty good about their shipping, but in this one instance they dropped the ball, and I do tend to hold Amazon to a higher standard when it comes to packaging conditions......And as luck would have it I ran out of time to get it replaced so now I'm stuck with it.

In closing the show is pretty good and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something different, and creative, and I guarantee my packaging ""situation"" is probably very rare, if not I might be the only one with this problem.  So don't let my rating shy you away from buying this, it's definitely worth the price and as long as you don't care about the points I mentioned then you're in for a treat.  Hope they will make more of this someday.....I should also mention I don't know if they've made a manga over this, but if they have I haven't read or seen anything from it, so this review is purely off what I've seen in the show.  Has a very Hayao Miyazaki feel to, very reminiscent of spirited away and other shows of that fashion.",1394841600,3,2716,4.2709551656920075

The story of a traveling 'mushi' (invisible creatures that life in its purest form) master, Ginko, who can't stay in one place too long because he attracts the creatures, which can be harmful.  The series sees Ginko in numerous situations where he tries to help others.  Most of the time he does, but at other times, the people he tries to aid refuse his help and advice, then suffer the consequences.  I enjoy listening to Travis Willingham's rich voice in this anime.

4705757,5,B005HVWWB2,"So if you think all Japanese anime is all big eyed girls and wild haired fighting hero videos, and fan art, you have a pleasant surprise in store for you. Mushi Shi means Bug master or in this case, little bug like spirtis and the man who can deal with them, Ginko.  Those little squiggly things you see when close your eyes? Mushi. His back story is just as intriguing as the everyone else's story in this string of tales about the people Ginko goes to help. He has a doctor pal who collects paranormal things, and part of what Ginko does is seek out Mushi artifacts for his friend. Some of which are very troublesome.
The soothing colors, even pace and special music make this a little gem for your collection.
The director of this master piece planned everything so carefully, from the the packaging (If you look Ginko is walking towards the viewer in the inside, if you paid for the original packaging he in on the front, as you progress he is turning away and walking off) to the colors used, to the music. Everything must be looked at and admired, like a tea ceremony admiration of the whole process, right down to the beauty of the teacup.

The story is episodic, which I normally dislike however it works to the advantage of this series because with every episode the characters that are introduced are well-thought and deep with a powerful past. However, not much is said about our two main characters, and as a result I never really felt for them or became connected to anyone either. It is only these small nit-picks that keep this series from recieving a perfect grade. Still I must give it credit for being so different and unique.

Basically, this is a good way to sit down and relax after having a hectic stressful day (or if you need to a nice change of pace from the ultra-violent animes out there). After watching it you feel calm and at peace.

All I can tell you is that for the outrageously good deal you get with buying this anime, it's definitely worth every penny. A good, quality anime that every fan of the genre deserves to watch.

The S.A.V.E. editions are definitely worth it. All DVDs come in a nicely designed case, and all the features such as the commentaries and of course the english language track are included.

4705848,5,B005HVWWB2,"Mushi are living organisms in their purest form. Ginko is a Mushishi, a man that studies the Mushi. Not everyone can see Mushi. Those that can are either scared of them or fascinated by them. Ginko travels the country helping people who have encounters with the different varieties of Mushi.

Each episode of this series is a different story. Ginko's travels lead him to many people that need his help. I am blown away by this anime. The animation, music, and plot are all superbly done. I can't say enough good things about Mushishi. I hope you check it out. It's great that Funimation put this title in the SAVE edition. It's a steal for the money.",1350086400,,650,4.555555555555555
4705849,5,B005HVWWB2,"Mushi-Shi is animation at its best.  This series shows that not only can Japanese animation stand among the heavyweights here in America, but it can ever surpass them.  The only real short-coming of this series is that there is no over-arching plot of any kind.  But the vignettes are fun, the characters are great, and the series is one of the best ever mad.",1347408000,,359,4.578125
4705850,5,B005HVWWB2,"This is among the most popular manga series in Japan being voted number one by the Japanese fans at several recent conventions.  Unfortunately I have not read the manga, deciding to get right into the anime thanks to a $15.99 price on Amazon.  This set continues the excellent lineup of releases on the S.A.V.E. series by Funimation.  As a note: I watched this series in the original Japanese with English subtitles.

Speaking of subtitles, Funimation has outdone themselves in this set.  I almost wonder if another studio had prepared them.  The reasoning is that Funimation rarely explains certain words underneath the subtitles.  In episode 7 they use this a few times to explain one of the character's name.  The translation is quite good overall and the subtitles are very easy to read.

The backgrounds are gorgeously painted with a kind of soft watercolor style to them.  They almost seem like a blend of watercolor painting and old Chinese ink and silk painting.  There is a lot of green in the series, it's often used as a sign of life and vitality.  The characters are all pretty straightforward in their design and drawing, so it does leave a lot of the characterization up to the dialogue.  The animation is crisp and it looks great on a 46"" HD TV.  Everything is presented in widescreen as well.

The story is the true wonder of this series.  The episodes tend to stand alone with one story arc each.  Early on the stories seem a little lighthearted and the Mushi (the little spirits) seem quite non-aggressive.  It almost seems like these Mushi get mixed up in the human world and so some bad things occur because of this interaction.  But it seems at first that this interaction is coincidental.  As the series moves along, we encounter more frightening Mushi, and many characters who are affected by them have permanent afflictions.  A few even die (though most of these are revealed in flashbacks).

The stories are incredibly engaging, and the characterization of the supporting characters is nothing short of spectacular.  The supporting characters only have one episode (for the most part) to make an impact on the viewer, and they do.  I equate their characterization to Japanese Haiku.  Their stories are told in few words, but their stories and their actions seem to grip the audience and resound with them.  It's quite pleasing to watch and I never had the feeling that an episode was 'slow' or 'boring'.  Instead I enjoyed getting to know these characters for their brief time on screen.  I felt empathy for many of them, and I am sure most viewers will also.

I have always enjoyed anime, and I do fondly remember the amazing 80s and the pretty good 90s.  With a few exceptions the 2000 - 2009 years suffered a bit (maybe because of the Japanese economy, Korean outsourcing of animation, etc...), but I have encountered some spectacular series lately, and I am hopeful that this decade may signal a new golden age of anime.  These days we are seeing more and more series translated and released in the US, and quality series such as Mushi-Shi are shining stars of modern anime.  I highly recommend this series to anyone enjoying a stately paced series with lots of the supernatural and little action.  Even my partner who isn't really into anime enjoys it.  It's marvelous.",1342656000,31,3299,4.780530973451327

4705853,4,B005HVWWB2,"I found this series to be refreshing after watching more plot driven anime series.  Rather than having an over-arching plot line it offers a series of self-contained episodes with very few characters making repeat appearances.  Each episode tells basically the same story, Ginko, the Mushishi comes into town to investigate some unusual problem caused by mushi (primitive life forms that seem to operate on a plane of existence that occasionally intersects with the human world).  But with the ever changing cast of side characters and the varied ways that these episodes end it doesn't get boring, despite each episode's deliberate pacing.

I think that's actually the attraction of this series for me, it isn't flashy or noisy, the character designs are straightforward and the tone (along with the palette) is rather subdued.  But all of that works together.  Not to mention that more than a few of the mushi are genuinely frightening and that they often play on human emotions in affecting ways.  This series isn't for everyone (I could easily imagine myself hating it ten years ago) but I would recommend checking it out.",1339027200,,1126,5.054054054054054
4705854,4,B005HVWWB2,"I really liked this series. I've been into ghost inspired anime like Ghost Hunt and Another right now and this fit the bill perfectly. It was creepy and unique. Unfortunately there's no direction. The Wandering Mushi Master is just that: he wander from one place to the other and never really ends up anywhere. There is no story arcs and no end of the road. It's fun for what it is an each episode is entertaining enough and is a self contained story, but I'd say the series as a whole is plotless.",1335744000,,498,4.365591397849462

It is thoughtful and beautiful and I really wish they had dubbed season two. While I am willing to watch a show subbed, this one is not something I would actively watch. I play it while I write or cook or do any other chore and if I had to do it while also reading subtitles it would not be as enjoyable.

Maybe I overlooked the audio information when purchasing, but it was not clear, and as I was expecting the original voice tracks, I found the English actors inappropriately cheerful and fast. This was a gift for a family member who was as disappointed as me to hear the characters chattering away barely more seriously than an episode of Sailor Moon.

There also seems to be something going on with the screen formatting - it looks odd, like pan and scan, but I haven't yet bought a different (much more expensive) copy for comparison.

If you need a version with English audio, maybe the actors won't annoy you as much.",1514332800,7,719,4.698412698412699
