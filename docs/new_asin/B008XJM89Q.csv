5189604,5,B008XJM89Q,"Mill Creek Entertainment has re-released That '70s Show on DVD at a budget price.  This 2-Season release is simply Mill Creek's Season 5 DVD release and Season 6 DVD release in one shrink wrapper.  The cases, disc content, etc are identical to the individual season releases from Mill Creek.

==Packaging==
Seasons 5 & 6 of That '70s Show is spread across 6 DVDs (3 DVDs for each season) in individual paper sleeves inside two cheap plastic cases. I would recommend upgrading to a basic flip-tray case for about $2 per season.

==Audio/Video==
The DVDs look and sound great. The presentation suffers a bit (I'd say 9/10) due to Mill Creek putting 8 or 9 episodes onto each disc, but it's not a deal breaker (for me, anyway). These seasons' releases are 100% proper 16:9 aspect ratio!

==Contents==
That '70s Show was actually filmed in 16:9 widescreen, but framed in 4:3 for broadcast. Mill Creek's DVD releases of Season 5 and 6 contains all 25 episodes of each season in true 16:9 transfers. (I've compared various episodes with episodes posted on Youtube and these are the proper aspect ratio, nothing is stretched or missing from the top).
Below is a list of episodes on each disc.

Season 6 includes the above audio commentaries, plus 30-second promos for each episode; A '70s Flashback: Interview with Debra Jo Rupp; A '70s Flashback: Interview with Kurtwood Smith; Season Six in Six Minutes

==Bottom Line==
If you don't own the now-discontinued Season releases from years past, these re-releases are worth picking up. They're priced very inexpensively. The picture quality may not be as good as it could be (due to cramming so many episodes onto each disc), but this is a solid release. The proper widescreen transfer is a huge plus for me. The 2-Season pack is also a GREAT deal for $15.",1351296000,4,3219,4.497427101200686
5189605,4,B008XJM89Q,"Okay first the ""review"", obviously I haven't watched this DVD set yet as it has yet to be released but I remember these being two of the best seasons of this awesome show, even if it doesn't have the tons of extra features I am hoping for I'll most likely buy it.

Okay, now the question: Does anyone know if this has any extra special features that weren't already on the Season 5 DVD set and the Season 6 DVD set??",1346371200,,416,4.135802469135802
