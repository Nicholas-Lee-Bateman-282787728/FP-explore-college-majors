3982059,5,B002SQFZ68,"I've been a Bon Jovi fan for well over two decades.  I was excited to hear they would be releasing the MSG shows on a DVD/Blu Ray as their last concert videos have been filmed mainly in Europe (See<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bon-Jovi-The-Crush-Tour/dp/B000053ZRR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bon Jovi - The Crush Tour</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bon-Jovi-Live-From-London/dp/6305165971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bon Jovi: Live From London</a>) so you don't get to see the Arena set up or the lighting production they use.  But like most things the moving HD screens they used on the Lost Highway are amazing live, but not as impressive on a TV.

To see this on Blu Ray is fantastic its like having a Bon Jovi concert in your living room.  Other reviewers complained about the editing, I thought the editing on the Crush Tour DVD was much worse, and that the vocals were over produced.

One complaint, Bad Medicine over the credits.

You also get a copy of the documentary ""When we Were Beautiful"" on this DVD/Blu Ray as well.  Its the censored version which makes no sense, you don't have the option of changing the audio to allow the cursing to come out.

I bought my copy from Amazon.co.uk, it was well worth the $25.  It's a region 0 disc so it plays in any region, and it looks fabulous.",1267574400,,1384,5.429906542056075
3982060,2,B002SQFZ68,"Poor old Hugh McDonald has been in the band for more than 15 years now. Besides not appearing on the cover, he practically does not appear on the show. There is not one single shot focused entirely on him (wait: there is one, when he plays the bass line at the beginning of ""Keep the Faith""). As for the rest of the show, you know he is at the left part of the stage, and that's it. The paycheck must be really good.

The show itself is much worse than the CURSH DVD from 2000. It's colder, it's not very muhc inspired, it's weird. I'm dissapointed.",1266364800,,549,4.179245283018868
3982061,2,B002SQFZ68,"If you purchase this DVD from amazon.uk, it is the region 0 version.  It will most likely not play on any DVD player purchased in the US.  As of the date of this review, it is not available for sale in the US or Canada.",1266105600,,219,3.8444444444444446
3982062,4,B002SQFZ68,"THis is a great bly-ray release. I got this from Amazon UK.

The set list is good, Ok not in the same order as the real show, but that does not affect the release, at least for me.

the Band looks tired, but still, it is a very enjoyable show and the audio is superb.
Only complaint is why to put the encore as a BONUS ? you have to clik in each song's name to be able to watch to it. not good.

Good extras.

Higly recommended !",1265846400,,429,3.7865168539325844
3982063,4,B002SQFZ68,"Live at Madison Square Garden is a lot better than the other Bon Jovi concert DVDs but it still doesn't quite capture the magic those of us who have been to a concert know is the Bon Jovi experience.  There is still no DVD out there that shows why Bon Jovi is the best live band in the world.  Plus the con of Bad Medicine not actually being a live performance but listed as such on the back cover is just plain wrong.  Anyway the tracks on Live at Madison Square Garden are -

Lost Highway - still the same average country song no matter what they try.

Born to Be My Baby - An all right version.

Blaze of Glory - Slow, This Left Feels Right album like in style.  This is one of the best songs, especially the guitar intro they have in their repertoire. If I had paid money for concert tickets and had been looking forward to Blaze, and it was played like this, I'd be really annoyed.  Slow style nice for an alternative sounding album but not at a concert.

It's My Life - The bar graph lights on the wall behind are really getting into this song.  Alas Jon pretty much just stood there and pointed at the roof a few times and did a few upper body frog/breaststroke actions.

Keep the Faith - Jon whips out some Mexican shakers like he's in some primary school music lesson instead of playing in front of a crowd as an adult performer.  Wearing a vest and shaking the shakers around he looked just a tad foolish.  Some nice close ups of Richie's hands playing the guitar and showing how hard would be to do though.

Raise Your Hands - Well when they started playing this we finally found out the crowd was alive and not just sitting there. Highlighting the poor choice of the way they were playing the songs before this one. Bon Jovi has been watching a few Wiggles DVDs (as is evident by that awful Fast Cars songs on Circle) and Jon copies the skivvy boys' moves.  Instead of the usual ""Give me a V"" shouts he usually does to the crowd, he and the crowd do starjumps but without the actual legs leaving the ground part of the move.

Livin' in Sin - Not a Bad rendition.

Chapel of Love - Going to the Chapel and We're Going to Get Married lyrics do add to the stalker vibe of Always that followed but they should have mentioned the words, who likes a good stalker song or Always is coming up or something as the crowd had no idea what was going on.

Always - Jon starts mumbling a bit when talking about birds don't fly and words don't rhyme, then mumbles again at the end.  It's like he bit his tongue or something before telling his victim he will love her always.

Whole Lot of Leavin' - Sounds all right but no huge fan of this song, better than the Lost Hwy album version though.

In these Arms - Not bad but Jon's voice gets a bit winey during some of it.

We Got it Going On - Enough with the Lost Hwy songs, I just pressed skip however if you were at the concert you'd have had to endure it.

I'll Be There for You - Solo by Richie.  Actually probably sounded better than Jon would have with his deteriorating voice at this stage of the night.  David also backed up with the lyrics. Shows maybe what might happen if Jon died and Bon Jovi kept going with the tours.  Not sure why this happened, if it was just to rest Jon's voice or an admission that two hours is a long time for the ageing singer and his older bladder just can't last for two hours without being emptied.

(You Want to) Make a Memory - Jon comes back on stage in a pink shirt for this ballad.

Blood on Blood - Still wearing the pink shirt starts singing close to the crowd while some middle age woman yells a one sided conversation with him as he sings.  He then walks around a row in the crowd, so the cameras don't capture her being removed by security.

Dry Country - Pretty good sounding but has back turned to the audience for a fair while.

Have a Nice Day - Reawakens the crowd after the slower Dry County ballad.  Is a good choice for a concert playlist for this reason.

Who Says You Can't Go Home - Many in the crowd wished they knew if this was the last song for the night or not as they would have done just that if it was.  Just as annoying live at Madison as on the ablum.

Hallelujah - I skip any religious propaganda, Bon Jovi used to be about the religion of Rockn' Roll now he's singing Praise the Lord. What happened to the inflatable devils and half naked inflatable women of past decade concerts? So many good songs left out of the night's playlist for this.

Wanted Dead of Alive - Just like Blaze of Glory, the cool guitar intro is not present.

Livin' on a Prayer - Asks the Crowd ""So What?""  They don't have an answer let alone the usual ""We'll Give it a Shot"" reply.  Never understand why they get such un into it crowds on the nights they film these DVDs.

Bad Medicine - Just the recorded version played over the credits.  A pretty big con, this is not mentioned on the DVD cover.  It implies it's part of the concert on there.  There really is no excuse for this it is just misleading.

You Give Love a Bad Name - Very well done but not part of the concert DVD, you have to reach this by bonus track.  Clearly it was filmed at the concert and near the start due to costumes had on at time.  Why not just leave it where it was?

Runaway - Again very well done, makes you also wonder what great songs and concert staples might have been played and left off the DVD such as Lay Your Hands on Me, Sleep When I'm Dead and the always interesting to see how the opening guitar rift is played this time round, Something for the Pain.

Bed of Roses - Obviously from Pink Shirt part of the concert.  I don't really like this song but this is the best it's ever sounded.  Jon does the most crowed interaction of the night walking around with security and holding women's hands and things like this.

Easily the best DVD of the live concerts but also some obviousness that they are getting on a bit at times with Jon's voice and so forth.",1265846400,3,5936,4.172231985940246
3982064,5,B002SQFZ68,"I've seen the dvd in a japaneese copy and i think it's great quality. I disagree with the first review posted. There's no problem about editing it, as the other reviewer complained, because they had a stunning performance and included great songs at the dvd. They couldn't have put all the songs. Of course, always someone will prefer this or that song, but they put a lot of classics like Dry county, i'll be there for you (with sambora on the vocals. The songs are not in the order that they were performed? so what???? It doesn't matter.

Great live DVD. Entertainment guaranteed!!! This is reall bon jovi, not that last dvd release called ""this left feels right"". That was garbage... This new live concert is awesome!

I assure that every bon jovi fan will adore the release.",1259798400,15,779,4.63768115942029

3982067,5,B002SQFZ68,"Ive waited for a long time for a Bon Jovi Blu Ray concert, and this didn't disappoint!! WOW!!! Some are critical of
the band themselves, looking tired and ""just not into it"". I beg to differ. I'm only 3 years older than Jon , and wish I had half his emery!! Tico still believes his drum set is out to hurt him, and he hurts them right back./ Ritchie, is well, Ritchie, doing what he does best!!!  As to answer a couple on critics on sound quality, ever think it might be your surround sound system?? If you just play it through your tv speakers, you WILL be disappointed, BUT if you have a top quality system, it sounds like you are in the audience!!!  This was recorded live at Madison Square Gardens in 2008, so not really ""up to date"". But with as many hits as they have and use in this concert/documentary, its worth EVERY PENNY I SPENT!!",1484611200,,842,4.25625

3982143,1,B002SQFZ68,"I have been purchasing products from Amazon web page for a while now. But it in this particulary item I was very disappointed. And hope that Amazon con talk to the broker or producer that distribute this particular DVD.
I'm a Bon Jovi fan, and before a bought it, read the list of songs in the concert, for my surprise, when I saw it, the las four songs, and one of the most iconics ones, three were on a bonus that did not specify on the DVD : ""You give love a bad name"", ""runaway""and ""Bed of Roses"" to see and hear this songs you have to go the bonus menu !!!  But it is the same concert !! is rediculous !! and the other song : ""Bad Medecine"" you can not see it just hear it because they are finishing the concert and all the info on the producers and all that stuff is passing by...
I Hope that the amazon people can get this through the albums, producers...

I was expected a high energy concert and it seemed more like a pop concert. The music seemed to lack something and Jon Bonjovi's singing sounded kind of mellow compared to what I'm used to hearing in their live music. There are alot of good songs on this dvd if you don't mind a more pop Bon Jovi. I have seen some footage from their older concerts and they used to be a harder rocking high energy group.",1368921600,3,561,4.155963302752293

I have all their new releases and like them too - but the reason they are as popular as they are is from the 80s and 90s catalog, little of which is on this album.

3982161,5,B002SQFZ68,"My wife is a huge Bon Jovi fan. So I bought this DVD for her and she watches it nearly every day. The sound quality is there and they play all their hit songs. The video quality is pretty good as well. You can tell that Jon Bon Jovi is holding back his voice however and doesn't sing the high parts on some songs like the chorus of Living on a Prayer. Instead he points the mic at the audience and has them sing it (an old audience participation trick to make them feel good while the singer saves the effort). But he's still entertaining enough to watch. He does interact with the audience well and that's why he is still around. Still a lot more acoustic playing than I like but I didn't buy it for me so if the wife is happy then I'm happy. It's directed more for girls, that's what Bon Jovi really is all about anyways. So if your girlfriend or wife likes him they will love it.",1362614400,,882,4.104046242774566

However, while I enjoyed the concert immensely, I was disappointed that the mix in dolby digital mode sounded somewhat un-concert like. Ambient sound was way too loud and vocals were constantly drowned out by the electric guitar and the drums, and like what other reviewers have said, this really pales in comparison to some of the other bluray concerts I have, such as Adele's recent bluray.

The answers are: the sound was good and the crowd did not hurt the performance at all.

We were so impressed that we have played it numerous times and friends of our children have left our home as fans of the band. By the time you get to 'Livin' on a Prayer' you are pumped! Jon keeps the audience on their feet through out the concert and Richie dazzles the crowd with his brilliant talent playing the guitar.

Protegiendo la voz de Bon Jovi que en rigor nunca fue tan poderosa y los coros que acompaan y hacen que todo sea escuchabled e una buena forma.

3982200,2,B002SQFZ68,"This is a fairly decent concert blu-ray. The picture is beautiful...it really is? The 5.1 audio sound is really disappointing. The balance is terrible. The two channel sound sounds really good and the balance is beautiful, however in the HD age...who is lsitening to their blu-rays this way? That is the one draw back to a live concert that has a really good set list, especially for long time fans.

To me, the biggest disappointment of this blu-ray release is the edited version of the documentary, ""When We Were Beautiful."" I watched this documentary when it aired on Showtime. As it turns out, this is so far the only time I have been able to truly enjoy it and watch it as it was intended to be seen. This is the second Bon Jovi package that I have bought since looking forward to watching it again. Both times, the other release being the Circle Deluxe CD, the documentary has been an edited version of the original piece. It is really irritating that the multi-million dollar machine that is Bon Jovi keeps squeezing money out of me for this subpar version of the documentary. If anyone, like I was, is purchasing this package mainly for the documentary I would really caution you to think before you do so. What should have been a really nice addition to this concert blu-ray really ends up a depressing let down.

Just to be clear:
Concert - 3.5 stars (losses points for the 5.1 audio quality)
Documentary - 1.5 stars (absolutely NO reason to NOT release the authentic version)
Together - 2 stars

THe music is too studio like and does not have a live/concert feel to it.  THe audio is not even on par with Bon Jovi's Wembly Stadium album.

3982202,4,B002SQFZ68,"Wife and I have seen Bon Jovi many times in concert and they always put on an excellent show, this Blu Ray from the Garden is no exception. The crowd that night was in top form and it shows. Overall video quality is very good but the sound mix lacks compared to many new releases on Blu-Ray, comes off a bit on the soft side.",1281657600,3,325,4.015384615384615

It's just like going to the concert -- which we do every time they're in Los Angeles -- so anytime I want to see them live I can just pop it in!

3982207,1,B002SQFZ68,Just watched this Bluray last night and was not impressed at all. The sound was below par compared to most concert releases. Total waste of money. The sound does not have the concert feel. Better sound can be had from cassette tapes of 30 years past. It just lacks everything. Even the 2 channel audio was done in dolby digital when there is ample space on the BD to make it PCM. This is an example on how to make a horrible concert audio mix.,1278288000,9,443,4.223529411764706
3982208,5,B002SQFZ68,"I just purchased this DVD today accidentally thinking it was a CD and was surprised that it wouldn't play in a CD player when I popped it into a computer and it started playing the movie, I was immediately blown away by just the intro to the movie menu.  This is the first DVD of a live concert that I have ever purchased, so not knowing what to really expect when I first played it I just went and searched for all of my favorite songs but later after watching them I started from the beginning of the DVD and watched it all the way through thinking the whole time that this is one of the most amazing things that I have ever seen coming from Bon Jovi. This DVD will defiantly be going on my must watch again list.",1274918400,2,715,4.107142857142857
3982209,2,B002SQFZ68,"I had to recheck my system and recalibrate it several times before I realized that this DVD is perhaps one of the worst mixed concert DVDs I've ever listened to. Everything is out of phase, there is no significantly directional low end, and the vocals are disembodied and do NOT fit into the sound stage. It's as if someone who never mixed 5.1 suddenly just threw in a plug in (ahem, Waves anyone?) that extrapolated a 5.1 mix from a 2.1 mix without doing the work that it actually takes to do it. I would believe that is the main problem, except that the 2.1 mix is almost as bad. Let me qualify my opinion by stating that I'm a professional audio engineer and musician, so, take it for what you will...

Trust me, this DVD is already being used in MANY recording classes and mixing classes as an unfortunate example of How NOT to mix audio for a concert...

Then there's all the ""jumping"" video---this is very unprofessional. There is absolutely no way the filmmakers wouldn't have known beforehand that some of the mounts they were using were NOT sturdy under the SPL's of a live show. OK, so maybe they didn't think about it---oh well, then WHY did the video mixer/editors include all that shaky crap? No excuse...ugh. And while we're on the video editing---could we NOT edit a little better when we're dealing with crowd shots? I mean, the 300 lb. grossness is not what I'm paying to see---I mean, c'mon--- jiggling sweat all over the place---out of time dancing---I'll have nightmares for a LONG time. For that reason alone, this film should've been rated ""F"" for ""Fugly"". I've never been a fan of crowd shots at all anyways, but especially not when they include the sagging, middle aged, drunk crosseyed sweaty obese women trying to dance and just stand up with their hamburgers dripping from their mouths. Don't think that's pretty? Didn't think so...

Then there's the performances---well. Let's just say this wasn't one of the band's hottest nights. Lots of errors, lots of out of tune guitar, and lots of badness in the BG vox, lots of bass guitar flubs and several places where the drums get out of time with the SMPTE track...I was shocked. There was another rhythm guitarist backing up Ritchie, but because the mix was so bad, Ritchie (?sp.) was ""on his own"" (and not for the good) most of the night. As far Jon, he was, as usual, near perfect, vocally, but the mix covered him up and distracted from the quality of his voice. As well, the OBVIOUSLY overblown attempt to channel ""The Boss"" just seemed silly, from the V neck chest exposed leather to the out stretched hands gesturing the audience aimlessly, Jon is beyond this. Richie, bless him, still thinks he's the second coming of Stevie Ray, and between the two of them, you just sort of feel like you're watching an SNL skit...

OK, the documentary is pretty good. But, man, I just get a sick feeling when Bon Jovi tells the band to ""just have fun"" at the beginning---it just seems so contrived, so paternalistic, so arrogant, so condescending all at once, when I'm sure he didn't intend it.

I'm going to petition the company to allow a competent mixing engineer to redo this package. When/if that happens, I will consider rebuying it. For now, I am returning it. For all its flaws, most of which are acceptable (although the performances are nearly reasons to have NOT released this DVD), the amateurish, inept mix is most definitely NOT one of them.

If you're a very big Bon Jovi fan, and you want a good documentary, then buy this disc. If you're just wanting the concert, then I'd suggest you wait on a better mix, or a new release that will hopefully employ more professional mixing engineers. If the mix were just acceptable, I would have given this at least 3 stars; however, it is nowhere near that and I was torn between a 1 and a 2 star rating, so I erred on the higher end but I don't feel good about it.",1274745600,6,3888,4.563037249283668

Jon Bon Jovi consult David Foster on how to record and mix high quality Blu-Ray.

3982214,5,B002SQFZ68,"Yes, some cons: bonus songs out of context, no video on Bad Medicine, however, the overall experience far outweighs the coulda/shoulda.

First and foremost: Great, selectable sound! Nothing goes without it.

Bon Jovi got older, but not old. I think the band matures well; the long awaited live versions of ""Dry County"", Living In Sin"" and even ""Runaway"" sound appropriate to their (and my) age, I'd call it 25 years of artistic growth. The band is believable and fun, maybe more than ever.

Adding ""Hallelujah"" to the set, one of the most beautiful songs ever, not only proves once again that Jon really can sing, it suggests growth and honest appreciation of musical art. Brought across excellently!

Oh, and Richie singing ""I'll be there for you""? Fantastic!
