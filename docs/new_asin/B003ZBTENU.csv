8417907,1,B003ZBTENU,Did not know this DVD could only be played on a European electronic device.  Can't return it since I opened the package. VERY DISAPPOINTED,1383004800,,138,4.75
8417908,5,B003ZBTENU,"I purchased the DVD because I had the pleasure to attend the festival and wanted to re-live the festival. This is the biggest and best Heavy Metal festival in the world. I have purchased previous DVDs from Wacken festivals. This is the second one that was released as a three DVD set. Wacken is a 3 day festival with 2 big stages and 2 smaller stages. The DVD has highlights of the festival and by no means has all the bands that played that year. The DVD captures the atmosphere of the festival, like the camp grounds, the long lines at the supermarkets in the morning, the town and most of all the festival itself. The DVDs show all the fun and participants from all over the world that go to the festival. I would recommend this purchase to anyone specially if you have never been to the festival. The packaging and booklet are great. It is worth the price to see some bands like Running Wild (last show), Heaven and Hell (RIP DIO), and bands that have yet to tour outside of Europe.",1293840000,,986,4.364130434782608
8417909,5,B003ZBTENU,This was great show and a good way to see bands you would not otherwise get a look at . But it is not in NTSC it is PAL region 0 I Found this out the hard way once and bought a multi region disc player.,1290729600,3,202,3.4130434782608696
