5682726,5,B00BYHEQVW,"Scare Zone is not what you expect from a typical low budget indie horror film. It has a good story line, neat location setting, and an established cast that has some acting gigs on their resume so no carboard, novice performances here. The film doesn't take itself too seriously as one would describe it as a horror/thriller/comedy and moves along nicely. Its something you'd want to check out if you're into indie horror that has enough gore, wisecracks, and 'slash' murders to go around and keep you entertained.",1364342400,4,514,4.8522727272727275

5682734,2,B00BYHEQVW,"It wasn't too bad for a 'B' flick. My husband and I laughed all the way thru it. It had its moments of cringe scenes. If you're a fan of cheesy movies, (I am), then I think you will like it!",1432944000,,190,3.658536585365854
5682735,4,B00BYHEQVW,Fun movie!,1431302400,,10,4.5

5682739,1,B00BYHEQVW,After  about 5 minutes in the movie I knew this movie wasn't for me,1430006400,2,67,3.7857142857142856
5682740,3,B00BYHEQVW,It's a typical slasher film. Kinda low budget but not horrible,1427760000,,62,4.7272727272727275
5682741,3,B00BYHEQVW,"It was ok,don't pay to rent or buy.",1427328000,,35,3.5
5682742,1,B00BYHEQVW,Ugh.  Lame zone.,1426982400,,16,4.333333333333333
5682743,4,B00BYHEQVW,Actually enjoyed this movie. Predictable yes but fun. A bit too bloody here and there. So probably not a good choice for little ones. Characters are over acted but necessarily so. If you like campy dark humor then watch. If you prefer serious horror flicks then this is not for you.,1426636800,,282,4.549019607843137
5682744,3,B00BYHEQVW,"Be careful what you wish for. Claire was really into the death/goth scene. Seems she got a little more than she bargained for. This was a campy movie fraught with teeny bopper delights. Some 'jump out at you' moments, and some parts funny. Worth a watch...once only though.",1422662400,,273,4.708333333333333
5682745,4,B00BYHEQVW,"Really good! I liked the story, the action and the acting was okay too. Definitely worth a watch.",1422057600,,97,4.444444444444445
5682746,4,B00BYHEQVW,Not bad for a low budget movie.  Acting and plot were pretty good.  Worth watching once if you need to kill some time.,1421712000,,118,4.086956521739131
5682747,4,B00BYHEQVW,Good movie from start to end,1421107200,,28,3.8333333333333335
5682748,4,B00BYHEQVW,"This movie is like watching an After School Special but with blood, profanity and nudity.  The script is good and funny, the acting is good the production is good.  This movie gets a check in every box.  This idea is not original and no new ground is broken here but it is worth a watch.  I don't feel like I wasted any time on this one, I would watch it again.",1420588800,,361,4.042253521126761
5682749,3,B00BYHEQVW,"Some large plot holes, but also some decent acting, pretty stars, and just a plain old fun ride.",1420329600,,96,4.388888888888889
5682750,4,B00BYHEQVW,Very scary movie,1419811200,,16,4.666666666666667
5682751,1,B00BYHEQVW,Grotesque and horrorable film without any conceivable reason for its making or design other than a bad case of Malo Mentes!,1419638400,,123,4.904761904761905
5682752,1,B00BYHEQVW,Wack,1419552000,,4,4.0
5682753,4,B00BYHEQVW,Tongue in cheek horror flick. Fairly well acted.,1418428800,3,48,5.125
5682754,4,B00BYHEQVW,This movie pays great homage to the B horror movies of the 80's.  A cult classic in the making.,1416873600,3,95,4.0
5682755,3,B00BYHEQVW,"Fun film. Flawed, but fun.",1404777600,,26,4.4
5682756,4,B00BYHEQVW,"hey, its not the most original, but it's engaging and the script is pretty good...if you are a collector of Halloween horror films, there's no reason you shouldn't have this...",1391558400,4,176,4.9
5682757,2,B00BYHEQVW,"A pretty tame movie with some ok special effects. Not that bad, but if u can borrow before buying, do so.",1384300800,,105,4.0476190476190474
5682758,3,B00BYHEQVW,"The best way to watch this movie, as i did, was to go in with as little expectations as possible. This movie turned out to be a very watchable movie. It wasn't that scary and some of the acting was a little off but for the most part i would definitely watch this again!",1381536000,3,269,4.0
8575584,5,B00BYHEQVW,"I love these types of films! B-rated, but they have a certain quality to them. Basically, if you love B-rated horror flicks about haunted attractions then it is for you! The acting is surprisingly not bad, the effects (Lye Vat Scene) are pretty decent, and it was filmed in Orlando. It won a couple of awards, and all around a pretty good flick. Mind you, it was made in '09 so mind the music. Either way, I'm a fan now.",1472515200,,420,4.2625
8575585,4,B00BYHEQVW,"Honestly, good, but in context",1461024000,,30,5.2
8575586,5,B00BYHEQVW,"I love a Halloween themed horror movie. We don't get 'em very often, so when one comes along I have to watch it. I also like one that centers around a spook house. While this wasn't necessarily scary, it was a fun movie. Good independent film making in my opinion.",1457568000,,264,4.3
8575587,2,B00BYHEQVW,It is a okay movie.,1456876800,,19,3.0
8575588,4,B00BYHEQVW,"Some very good performances and excellent special effects.  Some of the dialogue is a groaner (in a good way) in terms of puns and delivery.  Try it, you'll like it.",1455580800,,165,4.466666666666667
8575589,3,B00BYHEQVW,"Good for Halloween. For anyone that loves horror/haunted attractions will appreciate this movie.  It's definitely a B movie, but because the story takes place in a haunted attraction at Halloween time, it's a good movie.  If you've been in these types of attractions & wondered, ""what if?"", you'll really like this movie!",1447113600,,321,5.153846153846154
8575590,5,B00BYHEQVW,I love this movie! Have watched it several times and doing the whole Hollywood scare thing myself I have gone to love it even more. It's one of those movies you will either love or hate. It's a B movie pretty much. You cannot take it seriously.,1446249600,,244,4.212765957446808
8575591,1,B00BYHEQVW,Cheesy B film.,1446076800,,14,4.0
8575592,1,B00BYHEQVW,It just was not a good movie.,1444867200,,29,3.2857142857142856
8575593,3,B00BYHEQVW,"I watched this a few months ago for free on Prime, i don't think i would have paid for it otherwise. It was typical B movie acting, with a few interesting turns. The script is decent, it could use some more work, but it's not awful, or even close to awful. The fact that i watched this a bit ago and i still can be like ""that was a decent movie"", in my books is a good thing. If you like cheesy movies, a few typical characters, an interesting villain and decent premise, then you will think this is okay, or good. Sorry if i cannot be of anymore help, it's really a like it or hate it movie, but if the first ten minutes intrigue you, then you will like it, as it keeps up the pacing and story throughout  it.",1444262400,,710,4.0
