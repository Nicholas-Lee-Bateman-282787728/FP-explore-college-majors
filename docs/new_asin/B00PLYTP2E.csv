6817582,2,B00PLYTP2E,"I thought this was going to be some great adult/teen adventure film. It is not. It is a kid's film designed for those who are below the PG-13 rating.

Sinbad (Shahin Sean Solimon) has to rescue the love of his life, the princess (Sadie Alexandru) from the White Deev (Said Faraj) who wants her soul. He and his small party must go to a large black sand desert island that is a combination of Mysterious Island, Greek Mythology, and maybe that Dante thing. The CG panning of the island shows magnificent scenery while everything was done on a very flat stage set...I could help think about ""Lost in Space.""

Half the film consists of flashbacks so we would know how Sinbad got himself a princess. The other half has bad CG/stop-mo animals and horrible kid's type of ham acting. The fighting choreography was a laugh. Could be a future MST project.

Two stars is generous.",1415923200,,870,4.6
6817583,2,B00PLYTP2E,"After all that waiting, I finally watched it. Alright- the negative out of the way 1st...

-I must say- the CGI effects bothered me. I know it wasn't a huge Hollywood budget project, but it really reminded me more of a SyFy original movie.

-The monster scenes were so low-key! Whenever a Harryhausen creature made an appearance it was a grand, larger-than-life encounter. The music even reflected that. Here, the sound fx & fight music were practically an after thought. The combat scenes really lacked the fantastic drama I was hoping for.

-Monsters weren't intimidating or very scary. That's so important for a movie like this. Their voices & roars weren't...*loud* & terrifying enough.

-Sub-par acting. The 1958 ""7th Voyage.."" had more convincing actors. (& I'm talkin' the *supporting* cast, too. Not even just the leads) & most of them weren't well-known at the time either.

Now onto the Pros:

- Fun homage to Harryhausen. It was good to see anything even close to ""Dynamation"" again in the 21st century & the references to his (well, technically the Arabian Nights') films.

- Patrick Stewart

-The fact that someone who isn't Peter Jackson is even *doing* a fantasy/monster movie in 2014.

So, maybe since I was going in with high expectations & am now a 46 year old guy who saw the Harryhausen films in the 70's, I didn't feel that same sense of being swept away on an adventure. Adulthood can do that to you.
Maybe it was the budget they had to work with. According to Imdb, ""7th Voyage's"" budget was around $650,000. I do wonder what the budget for this one was. (& considering box office inflation) Seems that they did so much more with so much less in the 50's.
It was alright. But I wish I liked it more.
My hope is that it's supported enough on VOD & DVD so that if Mr. Solimon does another fantasy project, it'll get the treatment it truly deserves.",1442966400,,1869,4.63939393939394

It is very difficult to impress viewers today because CGI is now so seamless. To me the use of stop motion characters keeps the action centered.  CGI sometimes has a problem with cramming to much action into a scene. I felt that this was a Herculean effort for the budget it had.  Thank you for making this film.  I do believe Harryhausen would have been proud of you for the homage this film offers.",1427328000,,571,4.451923076923077
6817593,1,B00PLYTP2E,"In some ways this movie is better than one star, Patrick Stewart's narration is great, but this is the rare film where I actually asked for a refund (didn't finish it, couldn't finish it).

And it's a shame because I don't think the actors were horrible or even the premise. The problem for me was that it felt like a watered down version of some of the earlier Sinbad/Ray Harryhausen films.

At one point there was a multi armed statue so I thought, ""huh, that was done before (this was used in the movie ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad""), I'm sure they'll have new monsters later"" only to then see a Giant Roc as the next beast. That's when I realized I could just do myself a favor and watch the older movies. It's important to note that the earlier Harryhausen films didn't follow the Sinbad voyages exactly and in truth the Roc does appear in the fifth voyage in the Sinbad stories. However, again, I felt like I could be watching the earlier films and get more enjoyment.

Also, the digital effects aren't that great, at least for the creatures. The movie started being more of a chore for me. And I'm the type of person who has no problem watching ""bad"" movies.",1425945600,,1165,4.434579439252336

But it wasn't terrible either.  It's kind of fun and when you consider the shoe string budget this was made on you have to give it some respect.  I've worked for film-maker, a lot of film-makers, and they promise their films will get distribution.  I don't know if the people who worked on this heard that line, but if they did can't be disappointed.  The little film that could.  Opened in over 30 theaters nation wide and now it is on Netflix and Amazon.  So give 'em a break; they made something happen.

6817609,5,B00PLYTP2E,"Yes, much of the acting is hammy, and far below Hollywood slickness. And yes, some of the plot is clumsy. But I still say this movie deserves five stars.

Why? Because it's totally fun!
Okay, I admit, I'm a sucker for old-school stop motion animation fx, and other practical fx, which this film uses a lot. And perhaps that passion for this kind of filmmaking, gives me a little bias, which helps me to overlook, or not care about, some of the flaws.

But since I like that, the rest of the film was icing on an already delicious cake.

And there are some delicious ingredients in the icing: sound design (very cool watching in surroundsound), a lot of the music, color, the Persian atmosphere (The origins of these stories, although usually attributed to the thousand and one Arabian nights, which is where most of the west learned about them, are actually from ancient Persia. Having a Persian American independent filmmaker do one of these stories, adds a level of authenticity to it, which one can feel if one is open to it), some (not all) of the music (some of it is a little overdone, but I might be over sensitive to that, since this is one of my great loves and career choice), costumes etc

And sometimes, the feeling of something having an ""amateur"" type touch, actually enhances the experience for me. The word ""amateur"", comes from the Latin root which means to love something.

The love for this material, and this kind of filmmaking, is palpable in every scene in this film. And that brings something that Hollywood can rarely do anymore.

If you go back and watch some of the early Ray Harryhausen work, you will see some equally clunky acting. In fact, even one of the later ones, ""Clash of the Titans"", has lots of clunky acting. I still love that movie because of the stop motion animation effects
I'm having watch this movie now more than one time, and although I laugh probably in some of the wrong places because of the cheesiness in some scenes, nevertheless, I will probably love this movie for many years. It deserves to be seen, and for those with an eye to the kind of imagination it takes to make this kind of a film, especially as an independent filmmaker, and I'm just kind of budget, with these kinds of effects, it will be cherished.

Could be MST 3K crew also bring another level of enhancement to a movie like this? Probably. But then again, not every episode of that show featured movies that are universally considered bad. There are number of those movies, which have followings and fans. I can actually watch some of those movies on both levels. I could probably do that with this one too.

I feel bad for those who can only laugh at this movie, and not enjoy it on any other level.

I think that a lot of the one star reviews are going to prevent some people who would have enjoyed this film from seeing it. And that's too bad.

And that's another reason why I'm giving it five stars.",1418947200,18,2923,4.49811320754717

8688587,2,B00PLYTP2E,"I am a diehard fan of Ray Harryhausen's fantasy films, with The 7th Voyage of Sinbad being my personal favorite. While I don't hate CGI by any means, I do prefer practical effects because they somehow always have a more intimate feeling since they're done by hand. This is why I love Harryhausen's stop-motion animation most of all. Even if it looks very unconvincing, the passion he put into his work shines through. Also, Sinbad is one of my favorite fantasy characters. He most certainly served as a model for more modern traveling heroes like James Bond, Indiana Jones, James T. Kirk, Luke Skywalker and so on. So when I saw teasers for this film as far back as 2010, and maybe even sooner, I was hyped, even if the promotional footage indicated a low budget, because it was clearly a passion project by fellow Harryhausen fans.
Sadly, the time and effort that went into this fan film does not compensate its deficiencies.
The only actor who gives a competent performance is Patrick Stewart as the narrator, and even he can be unwelcome at times because film is a visual medium - show, don't tell. Therefore, much of Stewart's narration is superfluous. There's one scene where the ship sinks, and a minute later, Stewart narrates, ""My ship had sank to the bottom of the ocean,"" and that's it. That's not an example of good writing. The rest of the acting is over-the-top and bizarre. Most of the actors speak their lines as though they've never acted before, are trying it for the first time, lack good instincts for the craft and were in serious need of a more seasoned director to tell them, ""Just try to sound like a normal person.""
The CGI is worthy of a PS2 game. And the stop-motion animation, which was the part I was most excited about, is quite lackluster. The only redeeming quality is that they managed to make it look like Phil Tippet's experimental ""Go-Motion"" process; in other words, they have motion blur. However, motion blur is only as good as the models' movements, and their movements are more stiff and stilted than those of Harryhausen's creations. Plus, they do not gel with the live action. For example, whenever Harryhausen animated a sword fight between live actors and his monsters, the actors would be given complex choreography to learn, practice with stunt men standing in for the creatures, and then filmed with the actors swinging their swords at thin air. Afterward, Harryhausen would animate the skeletons, or Khali or whatever and synchronize their movements with the actors' to create a visual spectacle. In this movie, Sinbad clumsily and half-heartedly swings his swords from side to side while the monsters do the same, and their motions don't match up. You're never convinced that the blades actually make contact. Plus, something about the cinematography fails to make the monsters look larger than life, or large at all for that matter. It's all so underwhelming.
I was one of the few people on Youtube excited to see this film and give it a chance, especially since it was written, produced, acted and directed by a man of actual Persian descent, Shahin Sean Solimon, who clearly gave his all, and because of the throwback to Harryhausen's work. Unfortunately, even I must admit that the finished product was not worth the wait.",1490054400,,3275,4.808510638297872
