4708564,5,B005IAAIE0,"If you are a fan of Donna Leon's books about Inspector Brunetti and Venice, these German TV videos (with good English subtitles) are for you!  Currently, there are 12 episodes, and they reflect the books, which are a must to read, themselves.

The actor who plays Brunetti changes with the 5th video, as I recall, along with the actress who plays his wife.  But the rest of the cast is the same.

These are really excellent shows, and considering what is on mainstream American TV, these are a great break from just looking at either PBS British series, or premium cable.  Enjoy!  Buon divertimento! Viel Spass!",1331424000,6,611,4.716981132075472

4708566,5,B005IAAIE0,"Episodes 7 and 8 are the last ones available, at least for the time being (I hope there will be more).  Here are summaries of the plots.

""Episode 7 - QUIETLY IN THEIR SLEEP - Mysterious deaths in a Venice retirement community are brought to Inspector Brunetti's attention by a young nun who is then nearly killed herself.  Brunetti's investigation turns up some unsettling connections to a secret church organization and to one of its charismatic members, a priest who is the community's resident confessor.""

(I particularly liked the ending of that one, but I won't tell you).

""Episode 8 - ACQUA ALTA - First a museum director and an antiquities dealer are murdered.  Then a Chinese art expert is brutally beaten and she fears her assailants will return to finish her off.  Brunetti must find out how greed and violence motivate the world of forgeries and could drive someone to kill for art in Venice.""

""Acqua alta"" (high waters) refers to the fact that, in this episode, the streets of Venice are flooded, and more rain is coming.

Overall, the Brunetti series are a welcome change from Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot.  By the way, have you seen Bruno Cremer's Maigret series? (In French with English subtitles; I just bought some, have not had time to watch them yet.  They say it reflects faithfully the atmosphere of France in the 1950's -- when I was young; but you were probablly not born yet...).",1321315200,8,1409,4.733606557377049

4708579,1,B005IAAIE0,Very disappointed by this product  I believed that I was buying an italian language D.V.D because of the title  instead it turned out to be in german  it is of no help for me since I am in the process of learning italian......,1399766400,,226,4.209302325581396
4708580,4,B005IAAIE0,"Entertaining but at the same time reveals corruption and ever present temptation of the rich, and the underdog's struggle against it. Brunetti reveals the crime with his faithful helper Vianello. The two forms a collegial but professional theme. The drama develops through the series and touches issues more serious then your average crime drama. Worth watching the whole series.",1392854400,2,379,5.440677966101695
4708581,4,B005IAAIE0,"It is disturbing to hear the characters one has followed in print for 20 years speak German, especially in the settng of Venice. The characterizations are very true to the books, with the exception of Brunetti's wife; another actress played her earlier and was much truer to the character in the books.  I think the films would be improved by being in Italian language. Moreover, some liberties have been taking with the books so that they reach a ""satisfying"" and moral conclusion. In the books, corruption often wins out over the fine detective work of Brunetti, who must give in to the pervasive corruption of the Italian political system. Uniform justice is a good example.",1392163200,,677,4.886956521739131
4708582,3,B005IAAIE0,"Leon's characters are very Italian in they're nature as they move about Venice. The dramatizations provide great views of the mysteriously wonderful city buy decidedly bad character portrayal. The actors seem somewhat un-Italian in they're portayals, look and dress, especially Patta, Elettra, Paola and Vianello and Brunetti' mother. A far cry from the Montalbano series. Why the RAI can't put something together for this great series of novels I'll never know.",1389225600,,462,5.52112676056338

4708584,5,B005IAAIE0,"Beautiful Venice.  Great plots.  Took some time getting used to German being spoken rather than Italian.  The characters spoke
Italian  only in greeting words.  But the actors are true to the characters in the books otherwise.",1362614400,,226,5.166666666666667
4708585,5,B005IAAIE0,I love this series. Can't wait until the entire collection is available. I've not been disappointed with either the product or the delivery.,1359676800,,140,5.130434782608695

8474388,2,B005IAAIE0,"I will not add what others have said about dubious and changing casting. This I would be  ready to live with, as long as the main character which is Venice itself was adequately showcased. But it is not. I believe this is not the creators fault  but the fault of Mhz and the image compression techniques they used. The DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Montalbano  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. The Inspector Brunetti images are a bit better than The Montalbano. The backgrounds are a bit sharper. However nothing similar to a good quality DVD. Also on some Brunetti DVDs, when the camera moves the background moves in a stuttering fashion which is very annoying. These are most probably artifacts from the compression process used. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1096,4.742105263157895

8474391,5,B005IAAIE0,"The Brunetti series is terrific. The mysteries are worth waiting for and the interplay between the personal and the main mystery in each episode  is not over done. I wish they had stayed with the cast that appeared in the first recorded episode, but for some reason the characters all changed faces as subsequent episodes appeared. I suppose there are contracts and such that account for it, but it makes watching the series a bit strange. The other strange bit is that the characters live in Venice where Italian is the predominant language, as I recall, but the show has been recorded in German, probably for German television, and appears in these tapes with English subtitles. A bit confusing. It keeps all parts of your brain in gear.",1468195200,,739,4.7734375
