8385620,1,B0030C19ZU,"My fiancee and I got this video hoping to learn swing for our wedding.  I have to say though that this video was totally off-putting right from the beginning.  rather than starting with the six or eight count steps of other videos or lessons (double-step, double-step, rock-step or triple-step, triple-step, rock step) Diamond has come up with a 'new method' that has you making drum sounds to cue your steps.

I had taken a 30 minute lesson with my sister and even though she isn't a dance teacher I got more out of that than from this whole video.  By the end of the video my fiancee and I were too busy shaking our heads and laughing at the hippie love-in that was being sold as an instructional dance video.

Save your money.",1286064000,,729,4.451127819548872
8385621,5,B0030C19ZU,"The instruction is so easy.  I have never been able to dance but now I can!  The video was simple to follow.  I was able to catch on right away.  I started watching the video in my living room by myself and my husband walked in and picked up the movement and started to dance with me.  While watching the video I felt like I was at the studio with all the dancers on the video. They were really having fun and I felt included.  It was fun!  They teach you to move to the music with your heart and surprisingly you stop thinking and just feel the music.  And guess what, I could dance without thinking about where my feet or hands were.  That was truly amazing. It made all the difference in the world!  I am so glad a purchased this dance video!",1267574400,2,745,4.075862068965518

Everyone learns in different ways. Some learn by doing... some by reading... some by watching... Hence everyone learns to dance in differnet ways.  ZeDiamond Dance Method is way of teaching/learning to dance that I have never seen used in beginner dance classes before.  Rather than using numbers, counts, step names or repeating left-right-left or other tools that can confuse you and discourage learning, ZeDiamond Dance Method teaches dancers to feel the rhythm in the music without trying to count along.  As you learn the steps for single time swing and East Coast Swing, you are also learning to connect and feel your partner.  By the end of the 2 DVD set, you can feel the music, feel your partner and just let the dance come out of you naturally.  You won't just learn steps - you will learn to DANCE!!!

This is dancing with your body and not your mind.  To be able to dance without having to think about it... Isn't that what everybody wants?  That's what you get with ZeDiamond Dance Method Learn the East Coast Swing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZeDiamond-Dance-Method-Learn-the-East-Coast-Swing/dp/B0030C19ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZeDiamond Dance Method Learn the East Coast Swing</a>",1266278400,,1369,5.384976525821596
8385623,5,B0030C19ZU,"Watch me now!! Finally a method that takes the clod out of my dancing. Taught by a master teacher. The warmth and love of the process permeate every frame. The boom-a-boom rhythm just gets into your body, moving your feet without trying. Even hours later.  In fact, I'm pretty sure if I had had this method when I took dancing lessons as a child, I would be writing this on my ipod during a break from my rehearsals for Dancing With the Stars.
Thank you so much for bringing this system to the public!!",1266278400,2,502,4.340425531914893
8385624,5,B0030C19ZU,"As the Creator of ZeDiamond Dance Method, I want to thank all of you who have ventured to explore a revolutionary new way to learn dance.  Sometimes you just want to stick with the tried and true, but a lead dance instructor of the tried and true method said when he saw our method, ""This method will reach the 60 % of people who can't learn ballroom the traditional way, plus, make it much faster for those who can.""  And it's true.  I just love to watch the faces of people who are dancing before they realize it without all the struggle.  Thanks again, and see you on the dance floor!
