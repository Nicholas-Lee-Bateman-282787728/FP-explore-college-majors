8134381,5,B000AIM0RI,"Many other reviewers inexplicably focus on how the 1935 adaptation of Enchanted April isn't faithful to the 1922 source novel by Elizabeth von Arnim or is somehow inferior to the longer 1992 version. Sadly for them, they're missing the point. Firstly, this is a work complete in and of itself, and neither enhanced nor diminished by specious comparison to a related work. Secondly, it isn't actually based directly on the novel, but the succesful 1925 Broadway play that the novel inspired, hence this being a US as opposed to European-made film. A single viewing makes this fact abundantly clear. Whats more, at a mere but adequate 95 minutes, the excellent 1992 version is not  and could not  be faithful to the novel either.

What we do have here is an utterly charming and concise little film that, despite its US  studio-bound production, effectively establishes both mood and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, especially by clever use of rear projection, matte paintings and spacious, well-appointed sets. Even within the necessarily limited characterisations and plot development dictated to by its abbreviated running time of 66 minutes, it manages to squeeze in much humour, both subtle and slapstick, wry, witty dialogue and an unexpectedly powerful and poignant ending. Lastly, and perhaps most of all, it leaves you wanting more; what more could one ask of any film?
Enchanted April is a masterclass in brevity and economy in its storytelling and filmmaking, and is highly recommended to all fans of early talkies.

It features a very clean print from an unconverted NTSC-PAL master, hence its unaltered running time, and optional French subtitles in a small yellow font. Additionally, there is an informative 2 minute intro  in French, sans sous-titres  by film historian and restorer Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films.
Just be careful to avoid the lower quality Spanish bootleg, titled Un Abril Encantado, on the V&eacute;rtice Cine label.

8134382,5,B000AIM0RI,"I originally read the book. Later I viewed the 1992 version which you may also want to view.

The film is monochrome and naturally in full screen format.

At the time of my purchase this was not available in the U.S. so I purchased from Amazon.fr and I am using a region free player.

This 1935 version is not quite as good as the remake and some of the characters are reversed in their ways. However a side plus which is a lot of fun is recognizing the actors and placing them in other films in which you remember them.

Over the years some people become more fun and interesting.  On the other hand some become staunch and passionless.  It seems that Lottie (Ann Harding) picked the latter to marry.  One day at her club she sees an advertisement to rent an Italian villa for a month she shows this to a friend Rose and offers to share the cost.

This leads to a great adventure with the beautiful Italian villa ""San Salvatore.""

The story is well written and could have made a good play as it has all the elements of understanding and misunderstanding.  Even some explosive scenes.

There all the characters, looking for a retreat from life, find each other again; for some the first time.  You will find yourself wanting it to go on.",1397347200,3,1237,4.400881057268722
