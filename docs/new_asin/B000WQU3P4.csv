8225184,5,B000WQU3P4,"Brilliant film with a devastating denouement. Carlos Saura's Ana trilogy which is hard to get nowadays, is a fine example of this great master's work. I saw it backwards, starting with 'Mama is 100' many years ago (and that one blew me away). I then saw 'Cria Cuervos' which is a heavy but typically unhurried film in which the magical realism coming from the wide-eyed little girl Ana's imagination is done so seamlessly as to make your skin tingle. I saw this film 'Ana and the Wolves' last and most recently. It is a film you will never forget.",1219190400,,547,4.5353535353535355
