2400425,5,B000B5SCAY,"I bought this for my 7 year old nephew.  He loves it!! If you child is into construction and farming machines, then this is a great DVD from him/her.",1193184000,,149,4.137931034482759
2400426,5,B000B5SCAY,"My son is 3 1/2 years old and is all about planes,trains and automobiles. Actually anything that moves. He loves this video. He will get out his tractors and play with them while watching this dvd. I'm very happy with the purchase.",1181174400,2,231,4.523809523809524
2400427,5,B000B5SCAY,My 20-month-old son had Part 1 and loved it so we bought Part 2.  He loves it as well.  He is especially fascinated by the segments on the pumpkin and grape harvests.  It's great to have something that will hold his attention for a while since he is not the least bit interested in cartoons or other pre-school shows.  I'm pretty sure Parts 3 and 4 will be gifts to him for his 2nd birthday.,1170892800,,391,4.173333333333333
2400428,5,B000B5SCAY,"We have all four DVDs and my son, who is three, loves them (and my husband, too!)! He knows all the tractor models, names, the details of the tractors and more!  He will watch these John Deere DVDs over any disney cartoon any day.",1169942400,4,230,4.2272727272727275
2400429,5,B000B5SCAY,"My son loves Tractors, and this one is even more fun than volume One! If you or your kids love tractors and big trucks, this is worth the price!",1168905600,,144,4.0
2400430,5,B000B5SCAY,"This Dvd is perfect for your Tractor loving child, Full of information and facts it will keep them entertained for a long time",1168041600,,126,4.521739130434782
2400431,5,B000B5SCAY,My 18 month old loves it. We watch John Deere 1 and 2 all the time. We just ordered John Deere 3. You will learn alot about farming and the history of this tractor. Fun songs.,1144368000,,175,3.888888888888889
2400432,5,B000B5SCAY,"My almost 2-year old son LOVES part 1, so we were eager to see part 2.  Overall I feel it's not quite as good as part 1, but we still enjoy it very much.  The video doesn't seem to flow quite as well as the first, and some segments tend to focus more on how the tractors are used instead of the tractors themselves (e.g. in the pumpkin harvesting segment, there are only a few tractor appearances as the pumpkins are brought in from the field).  The segment is still very interesting, but the tractors are what my son lives for right now.  That said, it is still a great video worthy of 5 stars, and we will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of part 3.

In this video, there are detailed segments on combines and bulldozers, as well as harvesting pumpkins and grapes.  There is also a short segment returning to some of the vintage ""Johnny Poppers"" introduced in part 1.  And for train lovers, there is a segment showing model diesel- and steam-powered trains delivering John Deere equipment.

All in all a great addition to your DVD collection.

Update 12/21/05:  This video has grown on our family.  It is now my son's favorite...he asks for it over parts 1 and 3.",1131667200,17,1164,4.417840375586854
2400433,5,B000B5SCAY,"Like some, I was suprised at the content of Part #1.  The 2 year old son loved it, so we bought Part #2, as well.  The content is similar and has enough ""adult appeal"" to make it interesting.  The pumpkins planted in Part #1 have grown up and are harvested in this one.  Otto still makes mistakes and goes backwards at high speed - my son's favorite part.  You get a lesson in combines - What a fabulous machine that is!  Overall, it is a great DVD if there is a tractor lover in your home.  My son is waiting on Part #3 - to be released in November 2005.",1131062400,8,555,3.9909090909090907

2400448,3,B000B5SCAY,"The John Deere tractors are fun to watch at first, but the entire DVD repeats almost the same thing over and over again.  Once in awhile they throw in something different, but even I found it rather boring.  The music is so so, and I felt like we were watching a very long John Deere ad.  Having worked for John Deere for 33 years, I wanted more for my grandchildren.",1376179200,2,367,4.214285714285714
2400449,5,B000B5SCAY,"We bought this for my son's 4th Birthday Party.  We originally were going to have an outdoor party, but it was storming that week.  So we moved it inside and had this playing in the background and on a big screen.  Almost every adult commented how great it was and the kids were mesmerized.  GREAT INVESTMENT!!",1373241600,2,310,4.482142857142857
2400450,5,B000B5SCAY,"I bought this for my 18month old grandson. He loves it! Wants to watch it all the time. Usually holds his attention for a good 20minutes, but then he keeps going back to it. And he loves the music, does a little dance when it plays. :-)",1357776000,,236,4.042553191489362

2400452,5,B000B5SCAY,"This was bought for our Grandsons Christmas gift.
He requested it since he already had the first one.
He was very excited, since it is not readily available locally.",1356393600,,165,4.724137931034483
2400453,5,B000B5SCAY,This DVD is awesome.  My 3 yr old loves it and we have watched it many times already.  It is educational and isn't at a preschool level.  I appreciate that.  I do not like how the narrator talks rudely to Otto but that is only once or twice in each DVD.  I definitely plan on buying DVDs 3 & 4!  I have learned a lot from this DVD.,1295222400,,331,3.7941176470588234
2400454,5,B000B5SCAY,"My son received Part 1 as a gift and both he and his 7 year old sister loved it. Santa brought Part 2 for Christmas, and it is just as loved. I really can't figure out what it is that my kids love about these videos. Their only connection to John Deere is that their grandparents own a farm. My son had some JD toys and clothes prior to getting the video, but he likes other things just as much. If you've never seen a DVD from this series, they basically consist of a series of clips of various John Deere tractors on display or in use, with a young boy narrating. The narration will tell you much more than you ever wanted to know about tractors. If it were a book it'd be really boring. Interspersed throughout this are various scenes where the narrator scolds on unseen character named Otto for making a mistake (dumping the wrong pile of dirt, etc.). Someone with a low pitched voice then exclaims ""Oh no!"", a phrase which the children will repeat over and over. Then the previous clip is run backward at a fast speed. It seems strange to me that in this technologically advanced age children would be so entertained by such a simple concept- there's no computer animation, no hyper-educational plot, and no fancy toys to buy with characters on them (although JD toys do cost a pretty penny). But that's what appeals to me about them. Beyond the obvious promotion of John Deere products, these videos are not commercialized and are sweet and simple, and it's nice to see children enjoying something simple.",1294012800,2,1511,4.518248175182482
2400455,5,B000B5SCAY,This video is as great as Volume 1.  Our 2 year old grandson absolutely loves this and we enjoy watching it with him.  It has enough things geared to his attention and it's enjoyable education.  Great job John Deere.,1293408000,,216,4.487179487179487
2400456,5,B000B5SCAY,"Highly recommend for any child who is enthralled by tractors.  Well made and includes other interests such as 4-wheelers, farming, animals.

2400458,5,B000B5SCAY,"My grandson is 2yrs. old and he watches this DVD over and over.  He is infatuated with tractors.  He dances with the music and says the different types of tractors.  The adults get tired of the same DVD, but he doesn't.  I'd recommend it to children, who enjoy truck, cars and large machinery.",1238112000,,293,4.471698113207547

8081716,5,B000B5SCAY,My little man is tractor obsessed and this is one of his favorite movies of all time. If I would let him he would watch it over and over again. I feel that this series is worth owning for any family with tractor loving children. It really does a good job of teaching them about what tractors do and showing them in action. The little songs get stuck in my head. There are wonderful scenes of tractors and other equipment in action. This DVD was played a few times over and over again as we drove across the country it was a life saver. We will be getting another video in this series soon. I will say that the dvd quality is great also as it has stood up to toddler abuse without scratching so far. The dvd really keeps my kids attention from beginning to end. It changes topic often enough to really keep them engaged and they do not sit through many movies. I also feel that it helps teach them about the farming process and there the food we eat comes from and also how animals are cared for. It is really a great buy and worth the money.,1452211200,,1041,4.158415841584159
