8377328,5,B002PTYYYW,I am a Weight Watcher's member and missed out on getting this at my meeting site.  When I found it on Amazon I was happy to purchase it.  I like that it includes multiple topics and shows you how to cook things.  A nice rounded inclusion of items that I am interested in.  Thanks Amazon for all you have to offer!,1396915200,2,313,4.081967213114754
8377329,5,B002PTYYYW,"I am an average weight woman in my 60s with arthritis and fibromyalgia.  This is my favorite video.  I try to do one of these 20 minute workouts each day.  Once in a while, I do two.  The workouts are difficult enough to keep me in shape but not so hard that I can't get through them.  I have tried to use other videos and find myself unable to keep up.  I also have worked out with my daughters and can only do half of what they can do.  So for me this is just right.  I suppose it would be labeled a beginner video, but I had a difficult time at first.  I would do as much as possible one day and then try to increase it the next.  Also, with the weights, I started with 2 pounds, then 3, then 4, and finally I now use the 5 pound ones.  I spent a few weeks at each level as I worked my way up.  For me at my age and with my abilities, this is the perfect workout.  Hard enough for a good benefit, easy enough that I can get through it all.  I love it!!",1386547200,6,955,3.757575757575758
