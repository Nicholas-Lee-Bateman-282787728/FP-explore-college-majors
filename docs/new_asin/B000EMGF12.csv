2523254,4,B000EMGF12,It was very informative.  We watch it often because it reminds us of what we need to do continue being healthy.,1152230400,16,111,4.285714285714286

8111302,5,B000EMGF12,"I love these doctors.  All very interesting and exciting to learn about our bodies and how what we do to them, feed them, put on them affects us.",1222992000,,145,4.178571428571429
8111303,5,B000EMGF12,"First let me say this is an excellent DVD.  It gives good usable information. However, if you saw it on a PBS broadcast, then you have seen the whole thing.  The extra question and answer session you get when you buy the dvd is not worth paying for, if thats your reason for buying it.  I still think it is an excellent dvd to have so you can view it at your leisure to remind yourself of good healthy habits.",1202428800,2,409,4.0875
8111304,2,B000EMGF12,"Although the quality of information given on the DVD is excellent, it is grossly lacking in quantity. It contains less than 1/4 of what is in the book.

This DVD does include a 30 minute Q & A session with some of the audience, which is only fair at best. However, you have to go online to take the Real Age Quiz, a fact I never could find mentioned in the description. Nothing really wrong with the meager Exercise Tips.

For me, this was a case of more ""sizzle"" than ""steak.""

This production should have included the entire 130 or so  recommendations as covered in the book, or it should have plainly said that it did not cover what the book does.

This DVD is really just a promotion to get you to buy the book.

Again,I found this to contain excellent information, just not enough to warrant buying this instead of the book.",1198713600,15,829,4.35064935064935

8111306,4,B000EMGF12,"Come on.  You know you shouldn't smoke, eat refined flour and sugar, and need to exercise.  Too many of us are in denial and Dr. Roizen gives the straight scoop.  If you need to know the whys, then this is a great book.  There's no substitute for healthy habits and this may be the kick in the pants you need.  Who wants a heart attack in their 40's.",1172966400,4,350,4.088235294117647
8111307,4,B000EMGF12,"Dr. Roizen offers easy, practical tips for improving health and well being through diet and exercise.  His suggestions apply to the 50- or 60-something as easily as it does the 30-something.  It's a great place to start if you're looking to take better care of yourself.",1170374400,7,270,4.8478260869565215
8111308,4,B000EMGF12,"Dr. Roizen presents his ideas on how you can not only feel healthier, he explains how simple lifestyle changes can produce dramatic results, actually causing your body to feel younger. What is your Real Age? Can you really grow younger?

If you do absolutely nothing, you will continue to age. If you take simple steps like walking 30 minutes a day Dr. Roizen believes you can dramatically alter the course of aging. He talks about taking aspirin, the importance of sleep and why using olive oil is an excellent choice. I was surprised by his advice on coffee and you may want to read up on how caffeine affects aging.

Some of the main features of this short program include discussions about bone mass, muscle mass, blood pressure, exercise, dangers of saturated fat, breathing techniques to reduce stress, life-long learning and the biggest stressors to deal with first.

I learned a few helpful things while watching this DVD, especially the information on Vitamin D, which I think everyone has to worry about. This was very easy to solve with fortified orange juice - Calcium and Vitamin D. I was happy to find out that the orange juice my husband has been buying does have Vitamin D! One less thing to worry about!

While this DVD is interesting, I think I'll also buy the book to read more detailed information on all the topics addressed in the lecture.

8111309,5,B000EMGF12,"Very important information contained in the pages of this book.  I also bought the DVD. I watch Drs. Roizen and Oz on the Oprah Show whenever possible. I wish she would produce a weekly show called ""You, the Owner's Manual."" Learning about our bodies and how they work is the most important education of all.",1167782400,12,308,4.6
8111310,5,B000EMGF12,"It was so great that I gave them as stocking stuffers to my brothers, principal, and a good friend.  We're all 50+ and looking for sensible ways to stay healthy.  This DVD does just that, while explaining Why!  We love it.",1167782400,10,222,4.365853658536586
