7673165,1,B01C7TLFGE,Even one star this film did not deserve. The tittle has nothing to do with the scene they showed. It is a waste of money and time. After the viewing I tossed the DVD to the trash.,1466985600,,179,3.864864864864865
7673166,1,B01C7TLFGE,"I did not connect the story line with this at all.  I could not recongnize any of the actors and the filming was very poor.  The were not any
scenes within a church.  It did not show that the main character had a relationship with God until things in his life got BAD.
I cannot recommend this.",1466899200,3,293,4.105263157894737
7673167,3,B01C7TLFGE,Ok but it's all over the place (contradictive),1465776000,7,46,4.875
7673168,1,B01C7TLFGE,Poor example for young christian people. i wouldn't want my children to follow his examples. The only positive thing this man did was finish college. He went to church but nothing throughout his life represented godly change. It gives the allure that you can continue to sin and claim to be a christian. Such a disappointment. i would never want any one i'm ministering too to watch this video it can lead them astray not to God.,1465603200,11,429,4.584415584415584
7673169,5,B01C7TLFGE,Excellent movie!  Loved it!,1465171200,,27,5.75
7673170,1,B01C7TLFGE,This was a waste of money.  I'd send it back if I could.  I teach a youth group at church and I purchased this for the purpose of showing them a Christian movie......needless to say I wouldn't dare show this to them.  More of a drug and premarital sex flick than anything else.,1464912000,10,277,4.188679245283019
7673171,2,B01C7TLFGE,Not even a genuine movie to watch. Such a fake making movie that looked so cheap. I hate that kind. Oh well. $10 wasted here.,1464134400,,125,4.04
7673172,5,B01C7TLFGE,"Such an amazing film. Thoroughly enjoyed how all of the elements came together. Will definitely look for more material that comes from this writer.
Be sure to check out the book as well.",1459728000,2,186,4.666666666666667

7673175,1,B01C7TLFGE,This is not a Christian movie but a title to exploit religious themed movies popularity. A complete waste of time. DON'T waste your money too.,1493164800,,142,4.72

7673184,5,B01C7TLFGE,Great film that portrays how the enemy(devil) devises schemes that often ensnare us. Us being black men or any human being that falls short of the mark due to sin. It let's us know that no one is perfect and no one falls outside the mercy of God's grace.,1477267200,,254,4.204081632653061

7673187,5,B01C7TLFGE,Ok,1475884800,,2,2.0
7673188,1,B01C7TLFGE,"The Title is misleading. I wished I reviewed all the other comments before buying. When you accept Jesus as Savior, you don't continue to sin, you do you best to follow God's words. The drugs, the extra partners, etc....that's not being a Christian. I was very disappointed in this movie, I watch it all the way through and kept hoping this young man's life would change but the other thing that was good he continued his education and graduated from college, but the rest of the things he was doing was nothing but the devils work. I WOULD NOT recommend this movie to family or friends. I accepted Jesus at the age of 16, and no I am not perfect but I don't live that this man, I read my Bible and try not to do anything that would be disappointing our Heavenly Father. I want to please Him, and this movie is the opposite of that. Waste of money, to be thrown in the trash.",1474243200,14,875,4.27710843373494
7673189,5,B01C7TLFGE,"This was an excellent movie.  We need more like this one, it encourages one to reach for the star.  Thank you.",1473379200,,110,4.190476190476191
7673190,5,B01C7TLFGE,Excellent portrail of real urban life for black men in America,1472515200,,62,4.7272727272727275
7673191,4,B01C7TLFGE,"This film was good. The main character fell into many traps that young men deal with: bad association, hood violence, baby mamas and the temptations that loose women offer. He went to church once in awhile. The film isn't preachy. I cared for the hero but i didn't agree with many of his foolish decisions. In the end he seemed to get his life together. Highly recommended for fans of urban cinema. No profanity, nudity or graphic violence.",1472342400,2,440,4.653846153846154
7673192,1,B01C7TLFGE,Not what I expected.  The description on the package was more intriguing than the actual movie.  Poor quality of film and disjointed scenes.,1472256000,,140,5.043478260869565
7673193,1,B01C7TLFGE,Didn't even finish watching it. Poor filming.,1471996800,,45,5.571428571428571
7673194,1,B01C7TLFGE,I could not get through this; seemed disorganized and unreal. After watching Alex Kendrick I am spoiled.,1471910400,,104,5.176470588235294
7673195,1,B01C7TLFGE,"Terrible movie. I bought it to add on to my family library, only to be disappointed. Yes, the young man finished college and that's a good thing whether you're a Christian or not. He did go to church, but we cannot see any godliness as a result. True, we are nothing without God and nothing obtained without God brings lasting happiness, but the movie seems to portray that it is acceptable to keep sinning and still be called a Christian.

I would never recommend it to anyone. It is misleading.

7673200,5,B01C7TLFGE,"Powerful movie!  The protagonist has the odds stacked against him from the start, but overcomes the heartbreaking challenges and betters himself and his community!  Inspiring!  We truly are #nothingwithoutGod .  Not only does the film have a powerful and REAL message, but it's not fluffed with filler.  It's REAL and you can feel it!!!  Love the music as well!",1468281600,,361,5.033898305084746
7673201,5,B01C7TLFGE,"Very raw and real take on the struggle of a man using courage to rise up through the many struggles that come with being raised in the projects and with a tough family situation. Probably isn't a movie for kids- there is violence, drug references, and sex references. The story is not meant to depict perfection or having it all together by any means, but to show what it is to rise above one's circumstances and make right choices, even in the midst of struggle. I thought it taught a valuable lesson in that.",1468108800,3,510,4.4361702127659575

8752489,5,B01C7TLFGE,"This movie was incredible. It is very real and people need to realize how many can relate to this. I would encourage teenagers to watch this and then people can have discussions about the harsh things in life. Even though he has done sins, he still loved the Lord and enjoyed going to church. He felt the need to go to God for comfort and advice. Whenever something positive happened to him, he praised God. The overall theme and plot of this movie is great. To those saying he wasn't that great of a Christian, think about how Noah, Jonah, Job, etc. who have done sinful sins. God does not always call the ""qualified people.""",1496707200,2,626,4.452173913043478
