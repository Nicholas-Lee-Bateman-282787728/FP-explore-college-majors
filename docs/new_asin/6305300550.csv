1014842,4,6305300550,"No one can stretch a single joke as far as Lorne Michaels and the team at Saturday Night Live, and A Night at the Roxbury may be the ultimate proof of that.  The disco guys with the bobbing heads certainly had the potential to wear thin after just a few skits, so I had my doubts that there would be enough material here to sustain a complete feature film.  Surprisingly enough, there is - and the brothers' shtick never really grows old.

For brothers Steve and Doug Butabi (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan), life is all about hitting the clubs every night.  By day, they work - reluctantly - for their father at his silk flower shop.  Pops wants Steve to settle down and marry Emily, the girl next door (Molly Shannon) and bring about a merger of the two family businesses into a lamp and flower store, but Steve just wants to hang out with his more reckless and even dumber brother, dance the nights away, and maybe even pick up a woman successfully someday.  Privately, the brothers dream of opening their own night club - but they're stymied by the fact that they have never even been able to gain admittance at the Roxbury, the cream of the night club crop.  Then fate steps in and Richard Grieco gets them in and even introduces them to Mr. Zahir, the club's owner.  Suddenly, it looks like their ship may finally have come in - until the following day, when everything starts to crumble.  Will the brothers go their separate ways?  Will Steve take up permanent residence under Emily's thumb?

It goes without saying that this is a pretty dumb movie; the important thing is that it is a genuinely funny dumb movie.  Ferrell and Kattan turn these two characters into the kind of hopeless dorks you can't help but pull for, and a strong supporting cast featuring the likes of Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, and the late Michael Clarke Duncan (not to mention Molly Shannon) keep things entertaining when the brothers aren't showing off their dance moves.  Critics hated the movie, of course, so you know it must be funny; the blowhards in the media have no appreciation of comedy for its own sake.",1352505600,,2095,4.554666666666667

Honestly, this has to be one of the worst efforts I have seen to put a film on DVD.  I watched this one on my 40 inch tv but the picture of the film only took up 20 inches of if. There were big black bars all around the picture.  Also, the picture quality ranges anywhere from decent to poor.  A few parts get pretty grainy looking like there's dust on the film.
Surprisingly, however, the audio of the dvd is quite good.  Whenever the music picks up my sound system turns my room into a dance club.  It is pretty good sound quality.
I only wanted to write my review to let people know about the quality of the DVD.  The overall rating of this dvd could be a bit misleading to some people thinking that this is a well made dvd.  Im not even one of those people that obsess over dvd quality but this is one that got to me.  I haven't seen the quality of the collector's edition but if you're going to get a night at the roxbury, I would probably spend a little extra and get that edition.  It at least has to be a little bit of an improvement.",1330041600,,1274,4.031872509960159

Watching it again I will have to state emphatically that it ages quite nicely.  It was fairly contemporary then but now it serves as a terrific time capsule curio of late Nineties social mores.  The beauty of the film, however, is it's utter lack of pretense.  These guys just want us to love them and make us laugh.  Unlike a lot of the sketches from ""Saturday Night Live"" they've fleshed this one out pretty nicely at an economical 81 minutes.  Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan make for lovable doofs.

This ""dumb and dumber"" movie features two geeks who want to enter a disco and later want to own one.....all to get chicks, of course. It does have some very good disco music; somewhat likable leads; and an entertaining supporting cast - from the parents (Dan Hedyaa and Loni Anderson are a hoot!) to the bimbos to the exercise trainer.

The movie also is short, which was a good move. You can only take so much of these idiot Butabi brothers, played by Will Ferrell and Chris Kataan. This gets a little sappy at the end when the brothers feud, but overall it's a pretty good lightweight comedy with a good share of laughs.",1238112000,,758,4.734848484848484

1015097,3,6305300550,"As a devoted Ferrell fan my wife insisted that I finally get around to watching `Night at the Roxbury'.  Honestly, how can you claim to worship the comedian if you have never seen his earliest work?  So I made my way down to my local video store and rummaged through the videos until I found this DVD hidden behind a slew of less impressive fodder and made my way up to the checkout line.  Upon seeing the video I was renting the young girl checking me out starting to involuntarily bob her head to the side and hum the tune of some 90's dance track and I knew that I was in for a cult classic.  To label `Night at the Roxbury' a cult classic may not sit well with everyone, but to be completely honest it is the film that launched the mega-successful career of Will Ferrell, and that alone is worth mentioning.  Do I think `Night at the Roxbury' is Ferrell's funniest film?  No, but I do think that this was one heck of a start for his career and watching this film further proves that he's always had it.

The movie centers around brothers Doug and Steve Butabi (no...yes).  As has been mentioned, this film, along with so many others starring the SNL alumni, is just an expansion of their SNL skits.  These two brothers are as lame as lame can be, but in their own eyes they are the coolest cats on the block.  Doug, played by Chris Kattan, is the ringleader.  He's the more independent outspoken brother.  Ferrell's Steve is more of a follower, gullible and nave and easily manipulated.  They work in their father's fake-plant shop but their real dream is to one day open their own night club.  After a chance meeting with the owner of the popular club `The Roxbury' they find themselves one step closer to their dream but when their father, the girl next door and a bitter rival come between them and their nightclub they find themselves torn apart and their spirits, along with their dreams, begin to crumble.

This film is hilarious in scenes, corny in most, and just plain ridiculous some of the time, but as some have already mentioned, this is just good goofy fun.  This is not the type of film to take seriously so why bother trying to.  Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are hilarious here.  In fact, Kattan is so funny that I'm surprised his career didn't skyrocket as well.  It's funny to me to watch this film and see how it helped launch Ferrell's career yet Kattan hasn't done much more than the ill-received and poorly orchestrated Corky Romano.  Molly Shannon is also great here as the seductive manipulating girl after Steve's heart and the prospect of a family business venture.  To any fan of SNL or Ferrell will want to see this, as I'm sure they already have.  Now I can really say I'm a fan of Ferrell, a big fan, for I've seen his most recognized film, the film that started it all, and I can honestly say that from the dialog to the soundtrack it's a winner.",1194393600,3,2881,4.416666666666667

1015134,3,6305300550,"Sometimes you look at an old goofy photograph of yourself and you know that person so well - you just have to laugh. From today's perspective, that's kind of what watching this movie's like: The movie itself is parodying the `90's dance scene, as the characters themselves try to squeeze out whatever hip was left in late `80's music. And they go through it all as if they don't have a clue, as if we ever really did. From the first five minutes, the characters and plot are so clunky that you know how it'll end just as well as you know your own hand. But it's just as well, and it's so FUNNY, and if you have friends they'll get it right there with you.

The world is becoming filled with so much junk today, I guess time can only march forward, as new generations toss the bad movies of my adolescence into yestergeneration's trash bin. Perhaps some day our kids will watch this movie in an anthropology class.

I just hope that they don't make the mistakes we did.

1015187,5,6305300550,"The 1998 A Night at The Roxbury is a hilarious fun filled comedy that kept me laughing through the whole movie.  This movie follows two brothers on a hilarious adventure as they desperately try to get into the pristine night club, The Roxbury.  Try and try again, these guys are just not cool enough to sway the bouncers allow them to enter.  Fortunately, for Steve and Doug, they have a little fender bender with Richard Grieco (21 Jump Street) who escorts them into the Roxbury to avoid a law suit.  Now the brothers can live the life they only dreamed of.  This movie also features Loni Anderson, Molly Shannon and Dan Hedaya.

The two brothers are self pro-claimed proficient club hoppers who live in Southern California with their rich parents.  Their lives are full of rejection; from the women they try to meet, to the door-men who won't allow them to enter the A-Clubs.  It is so hilarious to watch these guys try to act cool as they try to pick up women.  These guys are so far off the mark.

Steve (Ferrel) is so ignorant that he is actually very entertaining to watch.  He almost always misses the topic of conversation and you wonder where he was just a minute ago.  It's hilarious.

Doug (Kattan) is the shorter, smarter one of the two.  He shows much more determination and is a lot more feisty and scrappy than his brother Steve.  He is also very funny to watch.

I liked this movie so much that I must have watched it at least a dozen times.  Every time I watch it, I find something new to laugh at that I missed before.  I have received much pleasure from this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes stupid funny.  These guys can take any normal situation and make it into something very strange and super funny.  You've probably not seen anything quite like this.",1124668800,,1785,4.46749226006192
1015188,5,6305300550,"After ""Wayne's World 2"", ""It's Pat"" and ""Superstar"", I kind of wrote off all ""Saturday Night Live"" - related movies (except for the first ""Wayne's World"" and ""The Blues Brothers""). But my mom came across a copy of 1998's ""A Night At The Roxbury"", based on a popular sketch featuring Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. I watched it, not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.

Anyone who saw the sketch on ""SNL"" knew that the Roxbury Guys sketch was the last one anyone expected to be made into a movie. On the show, the sketch basically had Doug (Kattan) and Steve (Ferrell) Butabi club hopping and head bopping to techno music and often featured little to no dialogue. However, thanks to smart writing and great performances from Ferrell and Kattan, ""A Night At The Roxbury"" ranks as one of the better movies based on an ""SNL"" sketch.

The Butabi brothers are club hoopers with small brains and big dreams. Their dream is to get into the mecca of all clubs: the Roxbury. However, they are not ""cool enough"" to get on the guest list. Plus, they face increasing contempt from their dad (Dan Hedaya), who wants them to take over the family's floral business. One night, they get into a car accident with Richard Grieco (playing himself). In order to get out of being sued, Grieco manages to get them into the Roxbury, where they meet the owner. They discuss potential business ideas with the owner, and are ont he verge of creating a successful club of their own. But family problems and a scheming bodyguard (Colin Quinn), keeps them from fulfilling their dream. From here on in, it's predictable, but it still remains a laugh riot.

The bottom line is, if you enjoy laughing yourself silly, then ""A Night At The Roxbury"" is the movie for you.",1124409600,,1760,4.652733118971061

However, they are clearly naive, not able to keep the girls, nor their status.  It is fairly humorous, even though I didn't think it would when I first began watching it.  An overall creative film.

1015285,4,6305300550,"NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY is funny!  Kattan and Ferrell did a good job of giving these sketch characters personality because as I remember this on SNL episodes, the only thing rhat they would do is their silly dance.  It was good to see this get a good a transition from SNL sketch comedy to film.
Kattan and Ferrell (Doug and Steve Butobi) are 2 brothers that have 3 goals in life. 1) Look Good, 2) Build their own club and 3) Get into the Roxbury, a high class guest list only night club.  After meeting 80's TV icon Richard Greico (played by himself), they finally get a taste of the Roxbury and they get to know the man that owns the club.  He then wants to set up a meeting with them but his assistant (Colin Quinn) wants to make sure that they don't ever get the chance.  So now, the Butobi boys have to find the owner, set up the meeting and make their lives complete by owning their own club.
This one is pretty funny.  Out of the wave of new SNL spin off movies (SUPERSTAR, LADIE'S MAN and BLUES BROTHERS 2000). NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY is one of my favorites.  It's not my all time favorite SNL spin off (WAYNE'S WORLD all the way!) but it is worth it and it has some great laughs in it as well.
For those of you who are familiar to this sketch, this gets a big thumbs up and to those of you who aren't familiar with this one, you might want to rent it first because I've known a few people that didn't like this one because they didn't know what the concept behind this movie was.

but they don't realize that they will never be as funny as them. This movie is a perfect example of that. SNL went from actual humor to just 2 hours of ongoing sex jokes. Although I did laugh at the Roxbury SNL skits, this movie just made me dissapointed, along with other SNL movies like Superstar and a couple others. They should just give up now. The old SNL cast was a legend. This time, it's just a wannabe joke. Watch the Roxbury skits and save your money on the movie.

1015427,2,6305300550,"Here is another 60-second SNL sketch stretched into a feature-length film (well, sort of, it's barely over an hour without the credits). And  stretched it is, quite thinly.
The premise of the series of sketches the  movie is based on features two brothers played by Will Farrel and Chris  Kattan. The brothers rarely speak, and the sketches are allegedly made  humorous because they're constantly jerking their heads to the side to the  steady beat of cheesy dance club music, regardless of whether or not the  music is present.
This is the one joke the movie owes its existance to.  The good news is that the brothers abandon the head jerking for the  majority of this film. The bad news is that removing the head thing  eliminated that one joke, and they forgot to add others in. Maybe they  tried, but it's hard to tell. The plot is entirely inessential and wearily  generic, serving only to place the brothers into new locations to make  wisecracks, and occasionally, have sex. Much of what is meant to be humor  is so woefully unfunny it's almost painful to watch.
But enough of that.  In the event that someone may happen to find some elusive perspective from  which A Night At The Roxbury has any redeeming value whatsoever, it is  recommended that he or she stick with the VHS version rather than the DVD.  The DVD, of course, comes with the advantages intrinsic to all DVDs: Longer  life, no rewind time, and better sound and video. But that's all. No  bonuses are included on this disk, save the theatrical trailer, which is  hardly of any value to anyone without Farrel's and Kattan's portraits  tattooed on their body. And in this sort of movie, sharper video and audio  don't really matter.

This movie copies the Austin Powers formula of satire targeting the late 60's. This time it's target is the  plastic polyester of the disco 70's and club music 80's with two goofball  out of place throwbacks. The biggest problem with this movie is it's poorly  written script. The jokes are so predictable you find yourself only  laughing at the slapstick. Two brothers who are dumber than Jim Carrey was  in 'Dumb and Dumber"" work for their father in a flower shop by day and  put on 70's clothes to  hit the LA circuit by night. They are refused  admittance at the hot club called the Roxbury primarily because they wish  to cut the line as VIP's. They should have just waited like everybody else.  They meet Richard Greiko via a fender bender and go in with him. The club  owner is a victim of his environment probably too many drugs and has some  funny lines. Overall except for a few stock jokes and good slapsick this  movie tries too hard to be funny but the characters are not defined enough  to be believable so it resembles a bad B movie at times.

1015466,5,6305300550,"I saw this film for the first time at a friend's house at New Years Eve and can honestly say that this is the PERFECT movie for having a party or LAN meet (to all of you online gamers out there).  I've described it as  ""The best movie on the face of this earth when you're half drunk""  and I maintain that opinion.
There's no doubt that Will Ferrell and Chris  Kattan are the stars of the show with their crazy antics and mental dancing  (That head bobbing is helluva catchy amongst friends).  The storyline  retains itself throughout and though it could be described as a  ""Typical American Story"" it's done with such humour that, for me,  it cannot fail.
The description on the cover is that it's ""the dumb  and dumber of disco"" - Very good analysis.
I'd like to say in  closing, try the film out.  It's a funny, feelgoood movie that everyone can  have a good laff at, and if you give it a reasonable chance I'm sure you'll  really like it - then you'll be like EMIIIIILLLLLIIIIIOOOOOOO! . :-)",955756800,37,995,4.366120218579235
1015467,5,6305300550,"When I first saw this movie I laughed my head off. I would compare it to Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. One of the brothers is smart, but acts dumb. One of the brothers is really dumb, but funny at the  same time. They first started their act on Saturday Night Live. They were  so funny they just had to make a movie. I give it 5 stars and if you see it  you should think that it deserves 5 stars as well.",955065600,,424,3.9069767441860463
1015468,5,6305300550,"This movie just plain makes you feel good.  It has excellent, upbeat music, very bright colors, and good hearted, LA slick and easy characters.  In short, mindless fun that looks great, moves fast, and keeps your toes  tapping.  Like the first Austin Powers, this movie has a lovable tone from  beginning to end and works great as video and aural wallpaper.  While  you're choring or reading the paper, lighten up to the music and glance at  the screen to get a dose of color and fun.
In my opinion, Will Ferrell  is very underrated right now.  He's got the super-friendly look of the guy  that everybody likes but deep back he has some dark reservoir that either  boils just below the surface or erupts in a burst.  I think his immense  likability allows him to go dark and get laughs where other actors might  just seem offensive.  This is mostly seen on certain SNL skits and  ""Dick"" (where his quick ""slowburn"" is more classic than  Ted Knight's).  In Roxbury he is likeable throughout, but a slight glimmer  of knowingness seems to filter through the character.  He almost seems to  be making fun of stupid movies by being stupid and winking at us.",952041600,,1153,4.603960396039604

1015470,5,6305300550,"A night at the Roxbury(Expanded from characters from USA television's Saturday Night Live,) is about two brothers(Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell paly the brothers Doug and Steve Butabi), who spend  most of their spare  time clubbing in LA. This of course sounds normal, but the Butabi brothers  are lovable losers, whereing rayon suits and their chat up lines on the  female population will bring tears to your eyes.
At day they work for  their over bearing father who owns a plastic plant store, but dream of  clubing in The Roxbury, the coolest most exclusive club in L.A. Their lives  are changed forever when they are involoved in a fender-bender with Richard  Grieco (playing himself).
This film is very very funny, and the sound  track brilliant. One thing is for sure, you'll never listen to Hadaway's  'What is Love' with the same eyes again. The film as some very funny spoof  moments, making fun of films like Jerry Maguire and Say Anything.
A  great comedy, the sound is grade A on DVD.
However this film is not for  everone, not all of my friends liked this film, but if you've got a good  sense of humour, I think you will. A night at the roxbury is a typical  funny american comedy.

It's really a mockery of guys who go clubbing, try to be suave and pick up  girls, and really don't know what the hell they're doing or how stupid  they're truly acting.  You can't help but laugh at how dumb the Butabi  brothers are throughout the entire movie.  While the second half isn't as  good as the first half, it's still a good buy.

Clap along as they boogie the  night away at the trendy hot spot Roxbury club.  Laugh with tears in your  eyes as they try and finagle the doorman into letting them into the club!  And who can forget their curmudgeon of a mother (played by the radiant Loni  Anderson) as she scolds the boys for.................well, i can't quite  remember but who cares!  It's all about those wacky disco dancing Watabi  brothers.  Witness in all the glory their coming of age in the  ""glitter years"".  Fall in love all over again in the  quintessential wedding sequence (conveniently placed at the end of all  cheesy cornball movies) where one of the Watabi boys marries the girl and  the other gets the girl and we're all left gasping for breath as we grab  another tissue from the kleenex box.  Tap your feet as the Watabi brothers  theme ""What is Love"" thumps in the background (cue the Watabi  brothers dancin' their famous jig).  Squirm as the credits role as they  play ""What is Love"" just one more time (with feeling).
With  oscar packed calibur performances by Chris Kataan and Will Ferrell, be the  first on your block to own ""Night at the Roxbury""!

One thing that truly amazes me is the incredible fashions of sexy and  body-toned spandex, velvet & sequence that were worn by the cast, and I  think Kattan & Ferrell make excellent fashion models for International  Male!

But, my question is, why is it priced  $89.00 for a VHS which has been out for years for a copy and is only priced  $20.00 for a DVD which hardly anyone even owns yet.  I think this is an  outrage for such a great movie.  Sure, I would pay probably $40.00 for this  movie and that is way over priced for any VHS movie but $89.00?  Please.  I  recommend everyone to buy a copy of this movie for pure enjoyment and a  great laugh but you might want to wait until it goes on sale or it is  actually released to where it will be normally priced.
