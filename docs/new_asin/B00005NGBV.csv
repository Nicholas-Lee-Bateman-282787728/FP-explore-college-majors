1634219,5,B00005NGBV,"I still love Babyface.  I have all of his cd's and I still listen to them all.

I don't normally like watching live performances on dvd (I'd rather be at the performance persoally), but this is great.  Almost all of my favourites are here and he does some great duets.  Breathe Again was performed with Shanice (who does a great job), Change The World with Eric Clapton and I Care About You (that was done by Milestone in Soul Food).  Also here is Whip Appeal which is one of my all time favourite songs from him from Tender Lover cd.

This dvd is probably as close as I'll ever come to seeing this master in concert.  I really enjoyed this and even though I've had it for years, I still watch it a couple of times a year and enjoy it each time as if it were the first time around.",1178755200,9,781,4.132450331125828
1634220,4,B00005NGBV,"i watched this live back when it first aired on MTV. Babyface showcased his many talents as a Songwriter,Msuician,Producer, arranger,vocalist,etc... this was a good balance of his own solo Career and Material he has composed for other Artists. in a Live Setting unplugged it truly adds extra light. my favorite song of the evening was ""Whip Appeal"" that has always been my Jam by Babyface since back in the day.",1178496000,,411,4.885714285714286
1634221,4,B00005NGBV,"The star of this amazing show is Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds. I loved this video very much, the only problem is, it gets bogged down a little in the middle. Guest stars include Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, K-Ci & JoJo and Mr. Edmonds two brothers, Melvin & Kevon. Babyface joins both Stevie & Eric for two songs apiece. On the version of ""Change The World"", I was really suprised to see how good a guitar player Mr. Edmonds is. On the two songs performed with Stevie Wonder, It's pure R&B. It's just the middle three or so songs that drag the performance down, to make this an almost perfect video.",1129939200,,597,4.486238532110092
1634222,5,B00005NGBV,"watching the dvd was like having bought a front row ticket to the concert & all his special guests for the night was such an added bonus. Babyface is the consumate performer who presents himself with the style and finesse of the old school performers.

A REAL CLASS ACT.",1121299200,5,270,4.510204081632653
1634223,5,B00005NGBV,"Babyface does an extraordinary job in ""crooning"" with his friends and family.
