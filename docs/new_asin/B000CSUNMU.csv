8101973,1,B000CSUNMU,"You'd think that putting a great cartoon on dvd would normally do it justice, but not in this case. This was a DVD I was really excited about coming out because I loved this cartoon when I was a kid and the taped version I have is kind of worn out.  I even pre-ordered it.  When I watched the dvd I was very dissapointed at the quality of the picture and the sound on the dvd was actually WORSE than what I have on my 20 year old tape.  It's bad enough that there are no special features on it, but the picture is dark and kind of fuzzy and the sound quality is absolutly terrible.  The voices are ok, but the music and the sound effects are annoying and don't sound anything like they are supposed to.  Your best bet is to buy it on tape, transfer it to DVD like I'm going to do with my old one, and hold on to the cover art because Koch at least they got that part right and throw the disc away.  It really sucks when you wait for a long time for something great to come out and when it finally does it really isn't so great after all.  Koch Vision must not have a good vision I guess. I would not recommend buying this dvd.  You're better off finding it on vhs at a pawn shop somewhere else.",1139702400,5,1194,3.9665271966527196
