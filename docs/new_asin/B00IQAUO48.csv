6286223,5,B00IQAUO48,"These two films are the first I have watched a few years ago. Godzilla: final wars is the Film that got me into the Godzilla films. I was impressed and I did fall in love with them so now I own all the Godzilla films I could find on DVD or Blu-ray.  I will say out of these two films although both good Godzilla: The final wars was to me the best.  I enjoyed several aspects of this film three that stand out: 1 it is a huge monster mash you see a lot of past monsters and you see Godzilla fight a lot of them.  2 the Sci-fi  Monsters attack, Aliens come bent on world Domination (even if they want to eat us in this film), and spaceships with ""Lazer"" Battles etc etc. 3 Godzilla looks great even if it dose look rather cheesy (still looks better then the 1998 american Godzilla later renamed Zilla whom also appears in this film).

So if your a sci-fi fan these two films are for you.  If your a Godzilla fan you won't be disappointed.

Do check out both these films I enjoyed them.....",1400630400,,987,4.109375
6286224,5,B00IQAUO48,These look really good because there are new  movies films that are not I would always look better have better picture quality sound is really good on this so buy,1400544000,,162,4.4
6286225,4,B00IQAUO48,"Positives:

The flip cover's a nice touch. Gives you the original DVD art. Clean without any extra text outside of the title.

The movies are on TWO Blu-Ray's with all DVD bonus features intact.

The default setting is Japanese with English subtitles and English-speaking actors undubbed.

$15 or less for two great Godzilla movies.

Negatives:

Are you SURE they remastered it in HD? It doesn't look much better than my standard DVD version. A bit sharper here and there but still incredibly grainy during nighttime scenes. Also, up-rezing the bonus features would have been nice as well.

At least ONE extra bonus feature would have been nice as well. Something to entice folks who already have the DVD version to upgrade.

Still, definitely recommend it. Final Wars is one of my faves.",1400457600,,788,4.916666666666667
6286226,5,B00IQAUO48,"As with the rest of the blu ray combos, this set looks great with high-quality video transfers and sound.  Unlike the other sets, these discs (there are 2 -- as in the rest of the sets) have some bonus features.  The features are non-narrated behind-the-scenes footage of the monster battles and SFX being shot, and then comparisons to the final footage.  I really enjoyed these extras, despite the fact that they're not HD.

The movies themselves are good, with SOS being a sequel to Mechagodzilla III -- which sadly is not out on blu ray yet.  I wish they'd kept more of the cast from the first film, but fans of Godzilla, Mecha-G, and Mothra should still enjoy this.  Final Wars is filled with crazy Matrix-like human sequences (which don't quite work) and frenetic monster battles, which are a lot of fun.  If you're used to slow-moving kaiju, the monster stuff may be a bit of a shock, but I found the whole thing a wild-and-crazy fun time.  There are so many monsters in this that it would be hard to list them all, but chances are your fave will be onscreen battling it out with Godzilla.  And the comeuppance for 1998's pretender Godzilla (from the US film), known here as Zilla, is worth the price of admission by itself.

Again, this blu ray is something Godzilla fans will want to grab right up.  The price can't be beat.",1400457600,4,1332,4.531380753138075
6286227,5,B00IQAUO48,"Godzilla is my idol!  I'm so happy Godzilla Final Wars is available on blu-ray!  I pre-ordered Godzilla Final Wars/Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S .  However, the pre-order price was higher than the actual price Amazon was selling it for.  Thank you Amazon for making the price adjustment and giving me the cheaper price.  When I got the discs, I was pleased to see that there was a separate disc for each movie, not two movies on one.  As a bonus, the discs came with Ultra-Violet copies.  So I got 4 copies (two blu-rays & two digital copies) for approximately $13.00 (about $3.25 each).  Now that's a deal!",1400112000,,598,4.628571428571429
6286228,5,B00IQAUO48,"Godzilla Final Wars is one of the best Godzilla films to date. Godzilla is frozen and aliens unleash monsters on mankind, and they have no choice but to unfroze Godzilla. Final Wars got one of the best monsters fight scene in a Godzilla movie and the Godzilla suit design is the coolest. The blu ray quality is excellent not munch on special features, but that's ok I'm just glad to own this movie. Final Wars is complete full movie, not like the 90's with cut endings, and Tokyo SOS is a good movie as well.",1399852800,2,508,4.3578947368421055
6286229,5,B00IQAUO48,"I love both of these movies. I was surprised they paired up these two movies. Just for the fact that Tokyo S.O.S. is a direct sequel to Godzilla against Mechagodzilla. That aside, I do like final wars. It is like a cross between Godzilla and the Matrix. Plus, I think it might have the most monsters of any Godzilla movie and one of the classic aliens trying to take over the planet themes. Tokyo S.O.S. is probably my favorite of the millennium series. It can stand alone and I actually did see it before Godzilla against Mechagodzilla. I believe it has the actor that was in a few of the 60's Godzilla movies and Mothra movie. Also, as in the other two-fer Godzilla Blu-ray releases, it has optional audio and subtitles.",1399680000,4,722,4.519083969465649

6286245,3,B00IQAUO48,"Tokyo S.O.S. brings back Mecha-G and Mothra's twin fairies.  There's plenty of destruction and some impressive shots of Mothra (who looks magnificent against the night sky).  Final Wars is hyperactive.  The audience has seen several times the basic plot (aliens who somehow think that controlling monsters is the best way to conquer earth).  What sets this outing apart is the look of the various beasties.  King Ghidorah has never looked better, not even in ""Giant Monsters All-out Attack.  Rodan is the exception--the energy waves that shatter skyscrapers are impressive, but he looks like a man wearing spandex.  Both films are worth a look.",1492387200,,644,5.194174757281553

Now Final wars, its meh, if it wasn't for the Kaiju fights and the hot female character, the movie would probably never be watched. Now one reviewer gave it one star because it was in Japanese. Ignore it. Thats a stupid reason. The movie is good still. The movie was made in japan, so obviously it'll be Japanese.",1491350400,2,572,4.386792452830188

6286248,5,B00IQAUO48,"Firstly, anyone who tells you Final Wars wasn't a good Godzilla film is not a true Godzilla fan. Final Wars was arguably the best Godzilla film ever made. Is the plot kind of odd? Sure. But what Godzilla film has a good plot? None. Because Kaiju lover's don't watch Monster films to see a good plot. They go to see Kaiju destroy cities and fight other Kaiju. And that's what Final Wars does arguably the best job at. Tokyo SOS, was a good movie. Not the best MechaG film but still VERY much worth it to buy this package!",1487030400,,520,4.262626262626263

While ""Tokyo SOS"" is not as good storywise when compared to it's predecessor ""X MechaGodzilla"", it's still got great action with Mothra as a nice addition.  I personally have never liked ""Final Wars"" (I've tried) and really never bother watching it anymore, it's just SO bad in my opinion.

6286263,4,B00IQAUO48,"""Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."" is a direct sequel to ""Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla,"" and it follows its predecessor in tone and style. It's a pretty restrained version of Godzilla. Once you accept the basic premise of giant monsters and robots stomping their way across Tokyo, it doesn't strain credibility too far. The story is fairly realistic and presented seriously without the corny dialogue and incomprehensible plots that you got in some of the older Godzilla movies. One of my favorites.
""Godzilla: Final Wars"" has a much different tone. It's sort of a kung-fu superhero dystopian future sci-fi version of Godzilla with a techno soundtrack. An army of superhuman samurai mutants has been given the job of defending planet earth from an ever increasing swarm of kaiju. When the UN Secretary General disappears, they realize they have a even bigger task at hand: defeating an alien invasion. Godzilla may be their only hope of turning the tide.
""Final Wars"" is much more of a fast moving adventure flick. There's a lot of jumping around, posing, motorcycle chases, martial arts, etc. In fact, there's too much of that for my taste. Since it was meant as tribute to Godzilla's entire history, the plot reprises some of the bizarre and corny stuff from the Showa era (Which is not really my cup of tea). On the plus side, there are some very well done monster fight scenes. It's okay if you don't think about it too much.",1473897600,4,1421,4.87603305785124

6286267,3,B00IQAUO48,"Let's get right down to it, Tokyo SOS is a four star all the way.  The special effects are top notch,  the story is good (for a Godzilla movie ) and the actors performances  (most of them anyway ) transcend the English dubbing.  Better to watch the Japanese language version with subtitles.  What makes these films work is the look of Godzilla and the performance of the actor inside it .  The suit is always slightly altered for every Era and during  the milenium series the film makers added subtle plating to the neck, giving Godzilla the look of a samurai warrior in full armor.  The movement of the actor suggest the original Gojira of 1954.
Final Wars is more straight science fiction, with a story about an alien take over of earth, with the aliens getting control of just about every monster in the Toho stable, except for Godzilla.  The heroes liberate Godzilla to save the earth (or what's left of it) at the climax.  There are quite a few action sequences involving the human actors which are fast moving but  become repetitive after a while.  Another unusual aspect of the film is the casting of an American actor in a major role.  I think the guy had a small role in Public Enemies as an FBI agent.  The film also features a rather jarring confrontation between a NYPD officer and a sterotypical black street thug, with an equally sterotypical black wino urging them to shoot each other.  The episode ends with the sudden appearance of Rodan, flying over New York City.  Overall, despite the bigger budget afforded this film, the story  drags and gets in the way of the reason we watch Godzilla movies, Godzilla destroying Tokyo yet again!
If this were Tokyo SOS, I'd give this four stars, with Final Wars in the package,  I have to settle for three.  If you can find SOS by itself,  it might be a better buy.",1463011200,,1822,4.530674846625767

6286290,3,B00IQAUO48,"Like the other related Sony double-packs, this offering represents good value despite low production effort (it even has the same generic front menu screen as the GMK/GxMG double pack). However, these two movies are a bit weaker than the two that preceded them.

Tokyo SOS is a merely adequate followup to Godzilla against Mechagodzilla (GxMG), shifting the balance towards a singular and nicely produced extended fight in the latter half. It generates goodwill initially with the combo of Mothra and the return of Hiroshi Koizumi, but other characters are entirely forgettable. A minor disappointment after the quite solid Godzilla against Mechagodzilla, including for largely leaving the cast from that first film behind.

Final Wars is the infamous ""love it or hate it"" 2004 film that seems like a mash-up of empty-headed music video, X-men wannabe, dramatic poses, and eventually even Godzilla...but it doesn't take itself too seriously and has its moments. Also, Don Frye as Captain Gordon entertains, especially near the end when he is more directly involved in the action. Skipping through most of the movie to get to the Godzilla fights (and the lunacy of the enemy commander trying to defeat him) and/or Captain Gordon parts makes for quickly rewatchable fun.

Regarding image quality--and as with the related GxMG--Tokyo SOS seems to have a crispness that translated somewhat better for the Blu-ray than the accompanying movie. Final Wars seems oddly soft for the most recent of the Godzilla films prior to Godzilla 2014. Ultimately, both films arrive as merely adequate as Blu-ray offerings.

Gotta love the old giant monster movies. There just something about a two or more full grown persons throwing tantrums in plastic monster suits that is ridiculously entertaining. Godzilla is a classical iconic character with a massive international fan base and a long history. This two movies are two of the best of them.

Godzilla: Final Wars is basically an fist pumping beat 'em up where it's Godzilla verses EVERYONE. He basically sets out in a rampage to murder every other monster that was ever in the series before then after a bunch of aliens use them as weapons for wiping out the human race. Features the old american godzilla vs classic japanese godzilla fight ( confusing but if you watched the 1998 american godzilla, it's kinda of funny to watch).

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S: It also has some pretty good fighting scenes with the newist version of mechagozilla. A giant mech built and powered on the bones of Godzilla's dead relative, the new Mechagodzilla might be japan's only hope to end Godzilla as a destructive force of nature. However there might be a heavy price to pay...

6286315,3,B00IQAUO48,"GODZILLA: TOKYO S.O.S. would, if I could score it separately, have 4 stars and GODZILLA: FINAL WARS would be given 2 stars. I like Godzilla movies, in general. I find them to be comforting in a strange way. I remember watching them late at night on a black & white TV when I was a little kid. There are only 3 that I really don't like and have avoided adding to my collection until now.

One of them is FINAL WARS. As a few other reviews have noted there are just too many elements in FINAL WARS. I fell asleep trying to watch it. The aliens, the mutants, and all the stock footage got very old very fast for me. My biggest problem with it is how quickly Godzilla tears through all the monsters that have previously taken at least half a movie for him to defeat. It just doesn't make sense (""sense"" being a relative term -- we ARE talking about Godzilla movies here, after all). Toho claims FINAL WARS had the biggest budget of any Godzilla movie up to that point but I find that hard to believe. If it's true the money wasn't spent wisely. If you're a Godzilla fan you almost have to watch it at least once though.

TOKYO S.O.S. is much better in every way! It is somewhat unusual in that it seems to be a ""direct sequel"" to ... I think its title is GODZILLA AGAINST MECHAGODZILLA. I've been watching ""The Toho Godzilla Collection"" Blu-rays for the past couple months and they're kind of getting jumbled together in my memory.

One of the coolest things about the myriad Godzilla movies is that they're not like links in a chronological chain. Time is not necessarily an arrow in the Godzilla canon. Some of them are sequels directly to the original GOJIRA and completely ignore the intervening decades of other sequels. Some of them are almost like alternate-reality sequels. For that reason, many Godzilla movies are fresh takes on the Godzilla character and I think that contributes greatly to keeping interest in the franchise alive.

I think, of the Godzilla movies I've seen, GIANT MONSTERS ALL-OUT ATTACK, GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE, and GODZILLA AGAINST MECHAGODZILLA are my personal favorites. They have good stories in addition to great monster fights and they also offer twists to the general theme, adding mysticism sometimes in interesting ways. GODZILLA 2000 is another one I like. But TOKYO S.O.S. is right up there with them, too. I've been impressed with the overall quality of the Blu-ray ""Toho Godzilla Collection"" movies.

By that I mean that the ""rubber suit monster movies"" are actually far better than I thought they'd be. They have made me realize the shortcomings of what has come to be called GODZILLA 2014 (new, original monsters!!) which I initially really liked; it had reignited my interest in and love for Godzilla in general. I'm trying not to get too specific about what happens in either of these movies because I find that annoying when I'm reading reviews. If you read the synopsis from the manufacturer you know all you need to decide if you are interested.

With that in mind, here is my opinion. If you're like me, FINAL WARS will stay in the container while TOKYO S.O.S. gets viewed multiple times.",1423612800,3,3135,4.6600361663652805

6286317,5,B00IQAUO48,"Just  finished watching ""Godzilla - Tokyo S.O.S./Godzilla - Final Wars;"" both released by Toho Studios as a double blue-ray set.
What made ""Godzilla -Tokyo S.O.S."" so compelling to watch is that there is an unexpected yaoi love story between a pilot and a mechanic as a badly battered MechaGodzilla is brought back into action as Godzilla goes on another rampage through Japan.  A first of its kind in Godzilla movies, I believe.
The Fairy Twins of Infant Island are brought to Japan on Mothra's wings to issue a stern warning.  Mothra will declare war upon Mankind unless the bones of the orginial 1954 Godzilla are returned to the ocean.  In ""Godzilla versus MechaGodzilla"" the bones of the first Godzilla were incorporated into the MechaGodzilla superstructure.
MechaGodzilla doesn't want to fight the latest incarantinon of Godzilla because it wants the peace of the grave; yet to obtain that peace it will do what's necessary.
When Toho Studios decided to make ""Godzilla - Final Wars"" as a send off to the series in 2004 before it went on a ten year haitius - it threw in the kitchen sink and stole from Star Wars, Star Trek, X-Men, Marvel, Power Rangers, Jules Verne, V - The Original Series - just to name a few.
All of a sudden Earth is under attack from dozens of giant monsters all at once.  Thankfully, for Humabnity, the Xilens arrive just in the nick of time to save the planet.  But as humans and mutants soon learn, the Xilens just want Humanity as a new food source.  So a desparte plan is hatched by a group of human survivors to lure Godzilla back to Japan for a last ditch effort to save Humanity.

6286318,5,B00IQAUO48,"THE BEST DUO BLURAY COMBO EVER ! Can't go wrong with Tokyo S.O.S. compared to its predecessor there is a little more monster melee and honorable early legends. I think Mothra has never looked so much more better than in any of her pre-series debuts. M-G2 certainly knows how to put up a good fight here like a boxer champ I say a touch of Mortal Kombat. This millennium series has an endcredit Marvel style easter egg like the former. You kinda wish the series hasn't concluded and more was to come. Oh well. Toho decided to round up it's Not-So-Popular-at-Home franchise up with GODZILLA FINAL WARS.(Likely the American 98 version is to Blame) Disappointed that this version quality doesn't quite actually have much of an improvement in HD mode. Still this movie was definitely the Motherload of All Kiaju Films and a Sweet Revengeful Blessing in disguise with the much Worldwide praised scene of ""Pretendor to The Throne""the Real King of Monsters Roasts the living Hell of the American ""ZILLA""! and just about every classical monster in the history of the Showa Series too make their final bow appearance! Unfortunately the Ghidorah is not the original but a sinister more powerful new space monster of the same species called a Keizer ""Emperor"" Ghidorah.

6286373,4,B00IQAUO48,"I'm giving 5 stars to Tokyo SOS. This is a fun Godzilla movie, even if it has Mechagodzilla recycled from the previous film (which is yet to be released in Blu-ray in the US!). Director Tezuka made three Millenium Godzilla films, and they are all fun, entertaining, and has a strong vision as to what Godzilla films at the beginning of the 21 century could be. This SHOULD have been the last Toho Godzilla films, with an ending befitting.
Alas, they had to make one more. And this is where it lost the star. Actually, if Final Wars was a stand-alone release, it should get zero star. It should get a minus star. It should get a black hole. It is one of the worst of the worst Godzilla films. Ever. Even worse than Tri-Star Godzilla (which actually shows up in super-cheesy CGI here). This director, when they announced the film, declared he had not cared for Godzilla until Toho came knocking on his door. And it is obvious. It is full of cheap Matrix knock-off human action scenes. Godzilla effects look decidedly shot in the studio - there is no sense of scale and grandeur exhibited in the four films which preceded it (the Tezuka trilogy and the superb and yet odd Kaneko version). The story is cheap, recycled from the cheap later Showa series (which itself recycled from earlier superior Showa series). I understand the director wanted to use Godzilla as a calling card for Hollywood (he went on to do Midnight Meat Train) so he had a bunch of English-language sequences with actors who can't act (but who can act with such bad dialog and horrible direction?). What a waste of film stock. They said this was the last Toho Godzilla for at least 10 years. I say, Godzilla gave up on Toho after this. The big G deserves better than this.",1404432000,,1740,4.526984126984127

6286377,3,B00IQAUO48,"If you already have the DVD's of these Godzilla films and are looking to upgrade to blu-ray, I'm afraid you may be disappointed. The blu-ray transfer is mediocre at best--especially on ""Godzilla: Final Wars"", which looks so soft, it's virtually indistinguishable from the DVD. The films are presented in widescreen, with the option of both Japanese & English soundtracks.

If you DON'T have these films already, they're two great additions to the newer Godzilla series:
2003's ""Godzilla: Tokyo SOS"" is a direct sequel to the film that preceded it (""Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla"") and features Godzilla, Mechagodzilla, Mothra(s), and a cameo by Kamoebas from ""Space Amoeba"" (aka Yog, Monster From Space). A nice touch is the casting of Hiroshi Koizumi reprising his role as Dr. Shin'ichi Chj from the orginal Mothra (1961).

2004's ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" was Toho Studios send-off for the Godzilla series, vowing not to produce another film in the franchise for ten years (2014). As such, they threw in everything and the kitchen sink: virtually every Toho Kaiju/monster appears in a cameo or stock footage, including the submarine from ""Atragon"" and the planet Gorath from the movie of the same name.  It's worth it, however, just to see the Japanese Godzilla trounce the CGI American Godzilla. I saw this film at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood when it opened, and the audience actually CHEERED at this scene!

The monster scenes are terrific, but far too short! Much of the plot revolves around a rather pedestrian story of an alien takeover of the Earth with lots of nods to The X-Men, The Matrix, Crouching Tiger, etc. Alien invasions are well-trodden territory for Godzilla films, and you'll find few surprises here.

The extras (which are not in HD) include the same behind-the-scenes short subjects previously included on the DVD's, showing how some of the monster/destruction sequences were shot. As I stated, if you don't already have these on DVD, it's a great deal; if you're looking to upgrade to blu-ray from DVD, the price is great, just be aware you're essentially getting exactly what was on the DVD release, at a slightly better resolution.",1402358400,22,2161,5.093220338983051

6286379,1,B00IQAUO48,"I was expecting something better than this. In an interview with Sony about these releases, the rep said new subtitles were made. New subtitles were made for the 90's movies (released along side this release) but I was extremely disappointed when I popped in Tokyo SOS. First, it doesn't look at all better than the DVD. It looks grainy. I had difficulty telling the difference between this and the DVD released a few years ago. But my biggest complaint concerns the subtitles. They're the same ""dub""titles from the DVD. They are not accurate translations of what the actors are actually saying, they're subtitles for the English dub. For some reason the english track keeps referring to Mechagodzilla as Mecha G when his name is Kiryu. The japanese actors are clearly saying Kiryu but the subtitles say Mecha G. Sony did nothing to fix this and clearly does not care about the fans of the license they hold.

I haven't watched Final Wars on the new Blu-ray, but if it's the same as the DVD, then I have no complaints about the subtitles. They were fine.",1401494400,2,1054,4.697297297297298

6286382,3,B00IQAUO48,"It's great to see so many Godzilla films coming out on Blu ray - especially in affordable two-packs like this one. And this is arguably the best release of the recent Blu ray series, because both movies come with decent special features (trailers and behind-the-scenes footage). Also, because both films are relatively recent, they have nice prints. Sure, they're not the crispest, most beautiful Blu ray prints in the world, but they are a clear step up from the old DVDs.

So why only a three-star rating? Well, because I think the actual movies are overrated. Both films rely too heavily on action scenes and not enough on drama (the opposite problem from the 2014 Godzilla movie). They also have weird tones. Tokyo S.O.S. is very sincere, and expects the viewer to actually care about its dorky mechanic hero who dedicates his whole life to Mechagodzilla. Meanwhile, Final Wars is an irreverent, juvenile mess that bombards the viewer with endless tacky fight scenes, weird special effects and posturing characters in leather jackets. It tries so hard to be cool that it comes out lame.

I'm probably being too hard on these movies; they certainly have their good moments. Sure, it's cool to see Godzilla hurl Mothra back into a building, or blast Gigan's head off with his atomic breath ray. It's just unfortunate that both films have poor human characters, and are clearly struggling to make Godzilla relevant to contemporary audiences. Not surprisingly, neither film was a big hit in Japan - and indeed, Final Wars was a sufficiently big bomb to put the Japanese franchise into long-term hibernation.

Still, these films are an important piece of Godzilla history. If you're a fan, you'll find much to enjoy here. But if you're just getting into Godzilla, and looking for a good entry point into the series...I'd advise you to check out ""Gojira"" (1954) or GMK instead.",1400716800,3,1875,4.927215189873418

8644635,3,B00IQAUO48,"First off I want to make clear that Tokyo S.O.S. is an enjoyable if flawed Godzilla movie. Great family entertainment. Highly recommended. 4 stars.
Second, I want to make clear that Final Wars has the potential to make your eyes bleed. Its hyper kinetic cartoonish music video overkill. I highly recommend you pass on it (and don't show this one to the especially young kids). 2 stars.

Both movies channel and/or are essentially remakes of previous Godzilla movies. Tokyo S.O.S. calls back to the original Gojira and the classic Godzilla Vs. Mothra and Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla II. Final Wars tries to be a new Destroy All Monsters with a hefty dose of Japanese ultra-violent and highly stylized live action manga thrown in. Oh, yes, and Don Frye and his moustache make an appearance that practically rivals the big G.

Similarities: In both movies Godzilla is the bad guy, the big threat, and other monsters and men seek to solve the puzzle of how to get rid of the great green gargantuan. There is monster action aplenty in both films, liberally sprinkled throughout S.O.S. and mostly packed into the back half of Wars. In S.O.S. you have the magical fairies, the Shobijin, who come to man to speak on behalf of Mothra and warn mankind of dire events to come but the Shobijin aren't a threatening presence. In Wars you have actual human-like aliens who come to man to speak on behalf of themselves and to enslave mankind and they are a ridiculous presence so they don't come across as threatening although they do threaten, they threaten a lot.

Differences: The monsters in S.O.S. have character, backstory, and quality. They have individual motivations even if Godzillas are hard to scrutinize. In Wars the monsters are controlled by the aliens to destroy the earth or defeat Godzilla and are generally quickly dispatched. Godzilla himself is a big bully and literally impervious to everything that anyone or anything throws at him. He becomes less interesting for this, not more. In S.O.S. humanity actively relies on their ability to control or appease the kaiju in order to save them from Godzillas threat. In Wars humanity reluctantly hopes that Godzilla will destroy the alien menace but not them. The acting in S.O.S. is practically Shakesperian compared to the abysmal posing and posturing of the actors in Wars. Wars draws heavily in the visual department from movies like The Matrix but doesnt come close to trying to tell a good story or deliver even decent acting. S.O.S. restrains itself to service its storyline while Wars junks up the film by throwing in innumerable styles and call backs. S.O.S. is bright but clear, the action is edited nicely so you can see what is going on while Wars is so fast its a blink-and-youll-miss-it or edited for style that you cant appreciate much of it.

The verdict is that S.O.S. is not only the superior kaiju film here, its the only one worth watching. If you must watch Wars for the kaiju action Id suggest finding a supercut of it somewhere on-line and save yourself some ache.",1512864000,,3037,4.834615384615384
