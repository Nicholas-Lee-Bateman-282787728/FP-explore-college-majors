2736238,5,B000MISFSE,"""By using a device that most people recorded their honeymoon sextape with, Ittenbach creates a film that bashes your face in, stomps your ribs, castrates you with rusted scissors, rapes your senses and pisses on your soul. You will never see another movie that delivers the gore like Burning Moon. This is one of the few SoV movies out there that has an audience beyond fans of super low budget horror or VHS collecting. It's a genuinely solid film that uses gore for humor and intensity. If there's one horror movie you watch this year, it needs to be The Burning Moon. 10/10""

2736239,1,B000MISFSE,"I rented this movie back in 2003. No budget, shot with a camcorder. The worse acting ever seen, the gore was plentiful but cheaply done. The gore could not save this film from utter crapville. Unbearable to sit through due to the story, acting, and production. I fast forward to the ""Hell scene"" and it takes place in someone's basement! No fire and brimstone or pits of suffering, just concrete walls and pipes! Necromantik is the only German gore film worth seeing. Stick to your Fulci and Savini classics, avoid this one...",1330732800,11,526,4.728260869565218
2736240,5,B000MISFSE,"the cover-art is funny-gross, however the information is a bit lacking on the back.

no format notification(ntsc or pal)
no region code status(1 or 0)
the year this claims of release is 1997(is this right?, i so thought this was released in 1992, maybe i am wrong)
originally released by dead alive productions on vhs and dvd(the same people whom released traces of death part 1 and 2 on vhs which i also still own).

out of all the super-gore films i have seen and purchased over the years, they are tributes compared to this german splatter-shocker.

one thing needs to be known to all whom plan to purchase this edition, it is clear to me this was taken from an out of print vhs, because it does not appear to be remastered, just transfered to dvd.

the inside packaging is very nice and contains a brief history about the film, director and history of how american took-to-it intially here in america.

if your vhs copy is worn or you don't want to go public domain(some ioffer sellers seem to be still stocking it,""are they breaking the rules of the bernie act code by not pulling it due to this release version""? just curious), then this edition is right up your ally and at a reasonable price.

the subtitles can be turned on and off(i turn them on because, sadly, i cannot speak nor understand one word of german(my fault, i am a terrible pollyglot(bi or multi-lingual).

please keep in mind this film is X-rated and NOT to be purchased/viewed by anybody under 18 years of age.

so grab a nice cold beverage,a cool snack, kick-back ,and have your senses rightously assaulted by a over-the-top
splatter-gore film which was banned for 20 years in the very country the director hails from(i feel for ya olaf ittenbach), i should know, i am a cannibal corpse fanatic and their first three albums are still banned in your country(ouch!!!).

the burning moon....for the moon burns and we are the willing victims of olaf ittenbach's horrible visions.

buy this NOW!!!

1)I don't care what move it is, if it be this one or another. I have never liked subtitles. You spend all your time reading. I like dubbed movies.

2736242,5,B000MISFSE,"The Burning Moon is an unbelievably gory splatter film from German Director Olaf Ittenbach. In the movie a little girls older, drug addicted brother tells her horrifying bedtime stories filled with some of the most over the top splatter ever seen. I have seen many gruesome splatter movies and this one is definitely near the top of the list. The scene in hell is so gruesome and horrific that it has to be seen to be believed.

I highly suggest buying The Burning Moon if you're a fan of hard core gore.",1217548800,26,504,4.478260869565218
2736243,5,B000MISFSE,"The tagline is, ""No matter what you've seen, you've never seen anything like this!"" That's pretty accurate.  The only thing that comes close is the Violent Sh! t series directed by the other German horror master, Andreas Schnaas. The Burning Moon is about a young man who is stuck babysitting his little sister (about 10) on a Saturday night.  So he shoots up, goes to her room, and tells two blood-curdling stories, titled Julia's Love and The Purity.  The first is sick enough, but the second one will blow you away.  The ending is like nothing else I've seen. Don't be surprised if it gives you nightmares. For this one, I recommend something at least 80 proof. And be careful who you watch it with. Some people might freak out.",1427414400,2,731,4.6

And after viewing, no reason and black past, this one is still my favorite!
He truly outdid himself on the gore in this one!

The set up is similar to tales from the crypt, but instead of the crypt keeper
you have olaf himself, portraying a unemployed strung out druggie
left with the task of watching over his younger sister..
He decides it'd be a good idea to shoot up and read her a story or two!

With copious amounts of gore and hilariously demented characters..
The burning moon left me speecless!

I would recommend this to anyone into extreme horror!",1417305600,6,635,4.456896551724138

2736250,3,B000MISFSE,"I first saw this German chiller in the late 1990's via the much missed video rental store. I had never heard of the film but many gorehounds  had mused about The Burning Moon's infamous, and shocking imagery. The story is most well known for it's sublimely violent scenes of a very demonic version of hell. I will admit that at first viewing, I was admittedly impressed, as a horror fan, at the gut-purging gore scenes as well the satanic story lines. If your looking for flashy, Hollywoodesque CGI effects, you will be disappointed. However, the campiness and the bargain effects actually aid the film. The acting is decent considering none of the films cast are professionals by any means. This movie is one to watch for true horror fans. However, The Burning Moon is one of those pesky German sickies that still doesn't get past the B-list. But hey, we all grew up cutting our collective film fangs on movies just like this.
  The Burning Moon is a trilogy film. It spews out three distinct stories about a depraved serial killer, a satanic-rapist priest, and an autistic murder victim back for revenge. Like I said, the killings are nasty and rough. The trilogy starts out as bedtime stories for the thoroughly unlikeable antagonist and narrator of the film's little sister. Let's just say, it ends badly.
  The Burning Moon as a German film. The characters speak German but the sub-titles are easily readable.",1391731200,,1414,4.802469135802469
2736251,2,B000MISFSE,"Idk why I bought this.  I love horror but somehow deep down knew the gore subgenre was not for me.  No real suspense or ""horror"", just gore.  I'm an embalmer and funeral director.  I deal with this everyday!!!!!!  I just wanted to see what everyone on the forums was buzzing about.

Good Lord, for a movie who's only real claim to fame is that it was banned in umpteenth countries I somehow expected more.  The production values are laughable for $13-15 movie.  Should be half that.

All in all it really wasn't as bad as I expected, and I somewhat enjoyed the second story, ""The Purifier"".  But this is not the 90's, and we as a society are becoming so desensitized to violence that this movie barely raises an eyebrow today.",1389916800,,726,4.473282442748092
2736252,1,B000MISFSE,"Amazon has this incorrectly listed as being widescreen. It is in old 1:33 ratio.

The quality of the film is very poor, and looks absolutely horrible on modern large televisions.",1374624000,,178,4.933333333333334
2736253,3,B000MISFSE,"This is a gory film yes.  Does it live up to much of the hype and praise?  Well, sorta.  I have had a few German horror come my way, most of which offer this same exact thing.  Nekromantik works, but most of the others didn't.

 The acting in this movie may be one of the movies weaker points.  It goes all over the place and can leave you rolling your eyes hoping it ends and some gore begins.  The movie is pure violence for the sake of violence and may be one reason it gets any kind of ""Video Nasty"" reference.  The gore is good and quite plentiful, but getting to it can be a problem as the acting and some writing drags a bit.

 It is a decent watch, but don't go expecting it to expand your horror experience.  It really is from the very beginning about people who don't care about authority or religion and simply disrespect others, do drugs, fight and kill siblings and innocent bystanders.  So there is no moral, no hero, and little justice - just violence strung together with a plot of a teen telling his kid sister 2 horror stories after he shoots-up.

 It isn't bad, but it isn't great.  The only ""Great"" aspect is the gore which stays pretty constant and decent all the way and then throws the big finale in your face right near the end.",1371340800,2,1252,4.241525423728813
2736254,1,B000MISFSE,"if it were made back in the 60's but this film was shot in the 90's!!  As others have stated; the acting is horrible, the story is so-so and the f/x are laughable, especially for the year it was made!  People who are so in love with this (seriously 5 stars for this) must have never seen real exploitation from the 70's or gore films from the 60's or maybe they don't realize when this was made!?  This is pure dreck and should be avoided at all costs!  If it were a feature from the 60's/70's I could overlook a lot of things and maybe give it a 3 star but as it is I'd actually give it no stars if I could!

Obviously for anyone that has seen it, the film itself is incredible and some parts of it are so over the top its just perfect. What I also really enjoyed was the ""Making of The Burning Moon"". It was really cool to hear Olaf talk about how it was made, I especially thought it was really awesome that they couldn't afford a stuntman so Olaf did all the stunts himself. All in all, if you are a fan of extreme cinema, this is a MUST HAVE.",1354665600,,580,4.0964912280701755
2736256,4,B000MISFSE,I will say the trailer for this film made it sound like some crazy film. The acting is so absurd at points its laughable. By the time the gore kicks in the film is almost over (sad face) but at least its good when it does i will say the ending is the most shocking part of the film. All in all average just try not to get bored with the drawn out plot.,1351728000,3,352,3.77027027027027
2736257,1,B000MISFSE,"This movie is horrible horrible horrible.  It's only got the hype it does because it's so ""extreme"" and because it was banned back in the early 90's in Germany.  This movie has no production value (except for the gore which is overall decent quality), no discernible plot (it's just an excuse to get from one gore scene to another), and no redeeming qualities.  Really, the only people that I would recommend this flick to are hardcore gorehounds that like gore just for the sake of gore, because that's all THE BURNING MOON is.  Horrible.  That's time I'll never get back.",1345334400,2,573,4.69
2736258,1,B000MISFSE,"Burning Moon is a spectacular failure in every way possible. The story tries to ape an anthology with 2 spooky stories being told, but they both are crappy and in the main arc a brother kills his sister, while, telling her... the stories??

The acting is a joke, the gore effects could be done better by a 10 year old with a red paint bucket, the mini-stories themselves are really uninteresting and drag out which is the last thing an anthology should do. The infamous hell scene? What a joke, you see people with some fake blood on them laying around (probably drunk) and then some drill goes into cheap prosthetics bought at party city.

The few people who gave this 5 stars were probably the actor's mothers, if you're into these kind of films watch something that doesn't suck, like the Guinea Pig series or August Underground Mordum, there's a reason no one ever mentions this pile of pig s***.",1345075200,4,900,4.583850931677019
2736259,1,B000MISFSE,"So this was called an Anti-Human Masterpiece by Zack Carlson from 'Destroy all Movies"", also ""An all out Splatter blow out"" by Heinously Clever word and phrases like masterpiece ahead of its time lost treasure and of course been banned in Europe first time on DVD bla bla bla.
I ordered me a copy expecting a film a little on the underground and ultra violent, lots of good gore and maybe some memorable scares. Man was I a fool.
The Burning moon offeres none of that, unless your idea of hideous gore is store bought plastic eyes covered in red jello or a pair of pants torn apart with fake blood shooting out to make you think someone was split in half. I know these things sound sick or at least funny, but after haveong to sit through amazingly bad acting and horrible stories poorly written its not. I mean what Heron addict shoots up and instead of laying back to enjoy his high he goes and read a gore story to his young sister. This same guy ""ruff ups"" his parents in a drug induced rage but they still leave him with there 9 yo daughter.
I think the filmmaker assembled the ugliest cast in the history of cinema, for that he should be rewarded not since the film ""Freaks"" have we see a film with more out of shape and oddly shaped actors. I use the word actors loosely because they don't act, the said heron addicts idea of getting high, well he has no emotion on his face that the heroin is doing anything but he now has stubble and messy hair so he must be high.
Yes this film has everything from witchcraft to serial killers and a silly 25 minute sequence in ""Hell"" but its so poorly made and acted with effects that look like he bought out a store on Halloween and covered everything in red jello. This film pissed me off because of the hype. I was expecting something with real gore something that might make me sick or at lesst laph at its outrageousness but all it did was piss me off. I now feel that its my mission to crow this the worst movie of all time and warn everyone that the hype is bull, only see this if you didn't buy it and even then I would say don't watch it because its just dumb!!!",1345075200,3,2115,4.224691358024692

2736261,3,B000MISFSE,"Classic, but did not live up to its reputation. I thought it was going to be over the top sick effects and story. Its neither. Kinda boring and not as gory as the box and other reviewers lead you to believe. The hell scene is gory, but u still have to sit through an hour of nonsense to get to it. I love low budget gore films and respect olaf, but this is one is pretty weak and lacking in all departents.",1332979200,3,406,3.9634146341463414
2736262,1,B000MISFSE,"I am shocked. Just shocked. And NOT by the gore and graphic images that were supposedly in this film. And I quote from the back of the movie box:

""Every other sicko horror movie is but glassy-eyed taxidermy above the mantel of The Burning Moon.""

Ok, based on that and a ton of other online reviews claiming this to be the mac daddy, let's just say I was COMPLETELY let down. Not only is this movie boring, but there wasn't much gore until about 45 mins in. Even then it wasn't that shocking. The only thing ""shocking"" is the ending. And again not because of the gore, but because of the absurdity of the tacked on scene.

I will say this, it is definitely better than a lot of SOV movies of the 90's. The PAL frame rate of 25fps is a lot more cinematic than the US 29.97fps which gave everything made in the 90's that video look. It also has an AWESOME gore scene where a guy gets split in half.

Basically I really don't have anything super positive to say about this. Save your money. Save your time. Go watch ""Inside."" Now that is the Mac Daddy of Gore.",1332288000,7,1058,4.2227722772277225

8169412,5,B000MISFSE,"This is German splatter at its best.  If you are familiar with Ittenbach you know what to expect..  The special effects are done with heart and passion by Olaf himself.  Mr. Ittenbach also directs, stars, does some stunts. He crashes through a glass window and someone sets him on fire.  He explains it costs too much money for stunt people so he does it himself.  This is shown in the great making of The Burning Moon special feature.

There are two bed time stories Olaf tells his  little sister.  This gives him the green light to assault you with a full menu of some heavy duty gore. You will be witness to decapitations, limbs severed, several gun shots to the head, throat slashings, teeth drillings, burnings, nails and corkscrews into eyeballs, and much more.  One of the show stoppers is some schmuk gets chains  around both legs and is slowly torn in half.  And here is one I have never seen.  A young woman is force fed her dead mothers eyeball down her throat.

There is also some funny stuff here.  There are important pointers to follow when Olaf goes for his job interview.  Make sure you watch it with sub titles this is priceless stuff here.  Also, what to do if someone honks at you to go when the light turns green.

There is a certain charm to Olaf Ittenbach films.  They are low budget for sure but  I have never seen anyone do so much with so little!  Do not expect a 100 million dollar Hollywood effects driven blockbuster here.

That being said, I do respect the movie for what it is. If you are a movie buff and have a collection like myself, it's a good title to add to it.
