7090584,2,B00VJIINKQ,"Overall these are one star shows, both cards feature ONE big fight and extremely weak undercard.  Both main events are a bit of a let down but feature just enough entertainment value to bump it up 2 stars.
Zingano blows it in under 10 seconds, looking like some jill blow off the streets who's only ability is bum rushing. RR technique is fantastic!

Diaz tried to fight but Androstane(cheater) Silva simply refused to do anything but back peddle and land some occasional shots. Its a close fight, if not for Diaz's antics and hard nose fighting style this would be almost unwatchable. I scored the bout even.",1436054400,3,609,4.682242990654205
7090585,5,B00VJIINKQ,UFC 183 was a Very Good and Entertaining Event.,1433289600,,47,4.333333333333333
7090586,5,B00VJIINKQ,"UFC 183 has 4 intense & exciting fights - worth 5 stars.

Thiago Alves vs Jordan Mein
Its a very exciting fight. In round 1, Jordan punched Thiago in the face many times but Jordan could not finish him off.
Round 2 was a big turnaround for Thiago, he knocked down Jordan with a kick to his side. Then Thiago kept punching until the referee ended the fight.

Tim Boetsch vs Thales Leites
Its very interesting and intense. In round 1, Tim knocked down Thales with a punch but Tim could not capitalize on it. In round 2, Time made Thales bleed from a cut on the face with a punch to his head. It ended when Tim passed out by a lock on the neck delivered by Thales.

Joe Lauzon vs Al Iaquinta
Its the best fight of this show. Both fighters had their moments. Both landed a lot of punches on their opponents. Both showed that they could absorb a lot of beatings. It's amazing.
The weirdest thing about this fight is Al always had his hands down. He never protected his face even after he got hits in the face! It's very strange.

In round 2, Al knocked down Joe with a punch to the face. Joe stood back up right away. Then Al kept punching and punching until the referee stopped the fight. It's unbelievable.
 .

Kelvin Gastelum vs Tyron Woodley
Kelvin attacked nonstop from the beginning. Its an exciting and intense fight. It ended at the end of in the 3rd round. The winning decision was made by the judges but I did not agree with it.

Nick Diaz vs Anderson Silva
Nick never posed any danger to Anderson in this fight. Its not as good as its supposed to be. Its too bad that after this fight both of them were found to have failed drug tests and were temporarily suspended. Diaz was punished for marijuana. Silvas pre-fight test was positive for anabolic steroids. A subsequent fight-night test detected undisclosed benzodiazepines, as well as a steroid. Therefore, to me, this fight did not count.

UFC 184 contains ONLY 1 great fight. It's worth 4 stars.

It's the fight between Ronda Rousey and Cat Zingano. Ronda threw a Judo takedown and forced Cat to tap out after 14 seconds of the first round. It's an amazing and beautiful performance by Ronda. She's TRULY a CHAMPION.

In short, this combo DVD is worth 5 stars.",1432512000,4,2220,4.405867970660147
