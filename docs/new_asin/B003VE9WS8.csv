8406707,1,B003VE9WS8,"This was a boring low budget movie.  This guy should have taken the money he invested in the  ""so called movie"" and saved it to do something better.  The acting was horrible and at the end, when he went on endlessly quoting the Bible scriptures made me turn it off.  If I wanted to be preached to I would go to Church.  If I wanted to hear and have explained to me the endless Bible scriptures that he was supposely explaining in the street venacular, I would go to my Pastor.  The entire way that he went about this was not educational or informative.  I wish I could get a refund on this one!!!",1299456000,,596,4.175438596491228
