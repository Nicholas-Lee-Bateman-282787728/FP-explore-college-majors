7935854,3,B00005ASO2,"Backseat Driver, as the title indicates, is a compilation of video footage shot from the backseats of a variety of sports and racing cars. It also includes 'The Restoration Game' documentary that can be found on some of Brentwoods other titles.
Like all the other Automotive Series titles released by Brentwood, this title possesses only mediocre video and audio quality. However in common with the rest of this series, it does include some interesting and rare footage.
For me this title is worthwhile purchasing just for the ""back-seat"" footage of a Porsche 936 doing a lap of Le Mans - passing Porsche 911 Carreras at 212 mph down the Mulsanne - the power sliding out of corners - Awesome! I would class this footage second only to the Peugeot 405 climb of Pikes Peak featured in 'Climb Dance'.",1021248000,3,797,4.782608695652174
