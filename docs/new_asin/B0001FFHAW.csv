8011654,5,B0001FFHAW,"La pelcula ""Comeback"" es un interesante trabajo de Eric Burdon, de corte ms o menos autobiogrfico. Una de sus ventajas es que incluye varios nmeros musicales donde el talento interpretativo del britnico es evidente.
Recib la caja con la pelcula (en formato VHS) en el tiempo en que fue prometida. La cita est en muy buenas condiciones.",1345852800,,335,4.894736842105263
8011655,5,B0001FFHAW,"The only complaint I have is the remark made by ""Beaumont"" in 2010. Never, Ever give a clue, any clue, or talk about anything regarding the ending of a movie. You could have left that comment out of your review, but I still bought it anyway because I am a hugh, long time Eric Burdon fan. I am not a film critic, I just know what I like & do not like. I am a hugh movie collector. This movie is not a blockbuster it's more of what I call a ""B"" movie; however, Eric Burdon's performance was awesome and in my opinion able to carry the movie by himself. I really do not understand why he never pursued acting. He is really a very good actor. In the movie he brought real life emotions when his part called for it. Drama, comical, humility, sincerity, passion, out of control, human emotions. Eric's singing performance was like looking at him in person at one of his concerts when he was younger. The songs that he wrote personally & the songs others wrote for this movie, when he was performing them in the movie he put so much of his heart & soul into each song with that deep gravel voice. If you are an Eric Burdon fan I highly recommend this movie. Focus on his amazing singing voice & performance on stage. I will watch this movie over & over just to watch & hear him singing. He's awesome. I wish they would put this movie on DVD. VHS Tapes evently will go bad,break not play anymore. I hope someone out there has the sense to preserve these old movies. Especially this one.",1328745600,5,1479,4.24822695035461

I won't tell you much because I don't want to ruin the movie but if you can find it get it...Eric Burdon is a great performer and a pretty good actor.... Great Music...",1296864000,2,310,3.9365079365079363
8011657,5,B0001FFHAW,"Hey,
I used to own this.
Made the fatal mistake of lending it out.
The new owner claims it got shredded, so he dumped it.
Yeah right!!!!!!!!
This is one of those movies ,that if you watched it, you'd keep finding a reason to do so again and again.
Like Purple Rain,it does not date.
This one though, does not have the happy ending.
So, if you start watching whilst feeling blue, you will probably end up being suicidal.
Great music though, might cheer you up inbetween the downers.
Now has anybody out there got a new copy for me??
Love is...
