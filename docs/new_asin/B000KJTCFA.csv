8157540,4,B000KJTCFA,"This product is meant to be viewed in the company of at least three friends, two pizzas, half a case of beer, and an unspecified quantity of a Schedule I herbal narcotic -- preferably as part of an evening of frivolous entertainment and reckless stupidity and possibly even as a break between long sessions of video- or role playing gaming. Used properly, satisfied customers will be left with goofy smiles, hairy palms, and the warm glowing aftermath of a comforting shower of geeky in-jokes and ridiculous hyperbole. However, intentional misuse of this product may result in boredom, confusion, and sexual frustration.

It's a non-studio spoof of a geeky TV show with a four-figure budget. To quote another reviewer, if you liked Airplane and the Naked Gun, you'll probably enjoy Cherub, but don't ask it to be anything it's not.",1267660800,,831,4.9784172661870505
8157541,2,B000KJTCFA,"people, unles you like slapstick silliness? don't bother.  if you like the police acedemy movies, or the naked gun, or airplane comedy movies, then this MIGHT be for you.

  please be wary though, this really badly produced bit of cinema will bore you out of your boobs. not lying here.  BORING!! was  realy hoping it'd be funny.  sadly..not for me it weren't.

  so buy at your own risk.",1180310400,,388,4.573529411764706
