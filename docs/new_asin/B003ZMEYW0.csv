8410686,5,B003ZMEYW0,"I marvel at where Thunderbean uncovers these golden bits of animation history.  Included here are glimpses at the animation industry from the WWI era to some hints at the current outsourcing of animation to Asia in the 50s and 60s.  In between are newsreels of Disney in its Snow White production days and 30s animation showing an imagined fantasy of animated film production.  Like their other release, ""Grotesqueries,"" I enjoy putting this disk in on random days and have it play repeatedly in the background while I grind away at any extended task.",1350950400,5,551,4.903225806451613
8410687,5,B003ZMEYW0,"As a 60 year old animation ""lover/enthusiast"" this DVD is an excellent addition to my collection!
 As someone who cares about quality in what I collect this is an excellent addition to my collection!
 Thunderbean consistently produces an informative/entertaining product and this bit of animation ""behind-the-scenes"" programming is delightful. If you are interested in Golden-age animation check out Thunderbean's lineup on Amazon--you won't be disappointed.",1321142400,6,458,6.030769230769231
