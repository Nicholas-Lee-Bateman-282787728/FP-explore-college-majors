7830201,3,6302676479,"I agree with the other reviewers who felt this was definitely a film for Vosloo watchers.  The film is essentially sexual fantasy for women.  (I disagree with the reviewer who felt the introduction of a second female  into one of the scenarios made it a male directed film.  Men generally make  fewer demands on story line in their fantasy films than was exhibited here,  and not all women are opposed to a menage a tois at least in a fantasy.)  The first two vignettes were a little too forceful for my taste, but then I  am inclined to subtlety and am probably more than a little prudish, despite  over 20 years as a nurse.  I also felt that the graphic sexuality of the  first two stories commandeered ones imagination and forced it along lines  designed by the director, a fact that I found more than a little irritating  although others may not.  The third story, while not necessarily neglecting  visual sexuality, was much more provocative, leaving more unsaid and more  for the viewer to fill in for themselves.  Mr. Vosloo was simultaneously  charming, daring and vulnerable, revealing a definite flare for romantic  characterization.  It seems odd that he has not been given more roles along  these lines since this film was made.",953337600,6,1240,4.754716981132075
7830202,3,6302676479,"""Double Dare"" is definitely the best of the three skits.  A man and a woman flirt from their window at work (at night) and by faxing  messages to each other, dare each other to more and more intimate  performances. This is supposed to be a woman's fantasy, seen from her  perspective, and up until the very end, she is the one calling the shots.  Arnold Vosloo looks embarrassed in some of the scenes and I'm not sure if  he is exhibiting real embarrassment, or if he was playing the role that  way... it's hard to fake a blush though. Another mystery about this video,  is that it is supposed to be derived from real women's sexual fantasies,  but while the stories ring true, the photographer is definitely filming for  a male audience.  For instance, the main female character faxes the  pans to the woman touching herself instead... and the camera really lingers  on her breasts.  When you finally see the male character, he has his arms  crossed across his chest... in other words, he's definitely not touching  anything (maybe that wasn't in Arnold's contract).  Another confusing  moment is when Arnold's character brings a third party into the game (which  obviously destroys the feeling of safety for her)-- I couldn't help but  wonder if this was really a woman's fantasy or a man's.
On the plus  side, I love it that Arnold's character in this skit is satisfyingly  assertive without being overly aggressive... that felt right.  Freedom to  explore without pressure was the main theme of this particular fantasy, and  I liked that a lot (it wasn't a twisted control issue like the skit before  it which I found disturbing).
Arnold Vosloo has a gentle quality about  him, but he has a strange characteristic that I've noticed in all his  roles, and this one is no exception.  He has a tendency to smile when you  would expect anger or hurt, and paradoxically, he'll be serious when you  expect humor or happiness.  Maybe that's why he usually plays the bad guy,  because his emotional reactions are kind of unsettling.
Fans of David  Duchovney will probably appreciate his cameo in this video as well... he is  not seen for more than a couple of minutes between skits, but there is a  sweetness about him that is compelling.",940204800,11,2234,4.7265625
