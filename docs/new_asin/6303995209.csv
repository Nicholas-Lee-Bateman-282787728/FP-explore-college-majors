7857978,5,6303995209,A hidden gem.  A smart thriller in true film noir form.  This is an unusual film I stumbled across on cable late one night.  It has plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I wish I could get it on DVD or Download on NetFLIX.  It seems to only be on VHS??,1276905600,,282,3.711864406779661
7857979,3,6303995209,"This is an entertaining film to say the least. Jason Miller is
great in his role as a detective trying to hide from his past.
The story unfolds with a complicated murder plot and builds from
there. The ending is very pleasing.",1089072000,,226,4.404761904761905
