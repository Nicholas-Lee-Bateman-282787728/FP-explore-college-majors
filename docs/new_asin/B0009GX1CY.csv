2290125,1,B0009GX1CY,"""Twice in a  Lifetime"" is a good drama and worth seeing. Unfortunately, this new DVD is not widescreen as Warner Home Video originally announced, but instead is an especially poorly done pan-and-scan presentation. I do not recommend this disc and am posting this as a public service to those who might be misled by Warner's original announcement or Amazon's ""technical details,"" which are incorrect.",1121040000,48,399,5.234375
2290126,5,B0009GX1CY,"I saw this at the theater when it was released and also purchased the VHS.  This is an excellent movie and it really mystifies me as to what took so long for it to be released on DVD when so much plastic is committed to garbage every week for movies that were better left to deteriorate on film (and were a waste of that film to begin with).

This is one of Gene Hackman's lesser known movies but he did a wonderful job of acting, as a long-time married man who meets a new woman bartender (Ann Margaret) on his birthday and begins an affair with her.  The film deals with the complications of Hackman's and Margaret's new found love as well as guilt, along with the anguish it causes his wife (Ellyn Burnstyn) and kids.  Perhaps Amy Madigan's acting as Hackman's forever-angry daughter is a bit over the top but I felt all of the acting was superb, as was the script.  True, adultery is not an acceptable behavior but it happens and in this movie we see the temptations that led to this happening, as well as the effect is has on everyone in a very realistic and emotional portrayal.

As an aside, I also enjoyed the bits of Pat Metheny's music that was used in the score.  This is a ""talky"" movie and contained too much profanity for my tastes but I also thought it fit with the movie.  Now that it is on DVD I am looking forward to its release because this is one of my favorites, and I prefer DVD over VHS.  Highly recommended if you are a fan of relationship movies.",1118016000,22,1471,4.262589928057554

2290153,5,B0009GX1CY,"An old film, but a beauty. Gene Hackman's character, Harry, falls in love with a barmaid, throwing a hand-grenade into his safe, boring family life. What makes this a great film, besides the perfect performances of everyone in it, is how everyone copes with the change.
If you've ever lived through tis kind of thing, this film really hits home. No car crashes, not big explosions, but every scene is meaningful, subtle and moving.
Don't miss it, especially if you are a Hackman or Ann Margaret fan.",1415318400,,499,4.747126436781609

2290155,3,B0009GX1CY,"This movie is about a good guy who finds a single beautiful, happy, woman who loves him and wants him. He has a wonderful wife, a loving family and a good life, but the new woman is more than he can resist. This is not about hate, but about choices that hurt others, others you love.",1399593600,,283,4.071428571428571
2290156,5,B0009GX1CY,"This movie was heart breaking. To see a couple to live out  a life of raising children to adult hood, then one decides they want something else,not concerned with the other one's feelings .It shows  how we make a decision  can result in hurting others,And  to  really think before you get married  or  have  children. This is a really good movie  sometimes tear jerking.",1390435200,,370,4.65625

2290168,4,B0009GX1CY,"Quite a tear jerker, and while it's hard to feel for Hackman's character, it's nonetheless well-written and acted.  Great commentary track by the producer and two stars.",1363651200,,169,5.2592592592592595
2290169,5,B0009GX1CY,"This tender drama tears at your heart; especially touching is the actress who plays the abandoned wife.  At one point you find yourself crying with her.
Gene Hackman's anguished middle-life man who wants a second chance to be happy with someone he feels compatible, is top-rate!
This drama depicts how even adult children are profoundly affected by the separation of their parents.  It is well worth seeing!",1357603200,,407,5.059701492537314

2290173,4,B0009GX1CY,"I was raised in the town of Snohomish Washington, where this movie was filmed. I bought it for only one reason I wanted to See Snohomish on film. If you live in the northwest you need to get a copy for yourself, so you to can recognize some of the buildings and streets that you also know. In the end of the movie there is a wedding that was filmed in the old First Baptist church. I built the cross that hangs in the baptistry for my sisters Wedding years before, it was kinda neat to see it hanging there and know that my work is in the movies.  If you choose to watch it you will enjoy it.

2290174,4,B0009GX1CY,"Gene Hackman is not handsome or suave.  He isn't a tough guy in the mold of Bogart or Cagney though he has a manly presence.  He doesn't have a romantic persona on screen, but somehow he carries off a believable middle-age romance with Ann Margret in Twice in a Lifetime.  Well, who wouldn't if the object of affection was Ann-Margret?

When a man leaves his family after fifty, dumps his wife, lovely Ellen Burstyn, and separates himself from his angry daughter, Amy Madigan of the short hair do and Ally Sheedy of the Brat Pack fame, well, all hell breaks lose.  If blue collar, Mariner and Sea Hawk rooting, Harry MacKenzie wants a second chance at love, he has to face the wrath of all those that love him.

This is an uncharacteristic look at middle-age divorce and love so rare in a Hollywood film.  Harry has wrought a moral and ethical riddle.  The audience will have to decide.",1127088000,7,886,4.528301886792453
2290175,1,B0009GX1CY,"for anyone waiting for a decent presentation of this fine film, keep waiting. The transfer is old and grainy and is only availabe in full screen. In this day and age of wide screen TV's and the DVD boom, how can a studio still release product without the slightest consideration for FILM FANS.....BEATS ME?",1125446400,15,306,4.685185185185185
2290176,1,B0009GX1CY,"Gene Hackman is my favorite actor, but with technology the way that it is, I would expect a better DVD transfer than this! It's dirty with scratches and spots and dropouts. Plus, it's only in full-frame format. NO WIDESCREEN!

I gave it 1 star because of Gene Hackman's performance but for me, it's unwatchable.

The tragedy is that this may be the only transfer done of this movie, since it's not a block buster.

COME ON GUYS, LET'S SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON THESE MOVIES! THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF GENE HACKMAN FANS OUT HERE!

By the way, same review for TARGET, although it is in widescreen. That was also very disappointing.",1122940800,13,633,4.526315789473684
8060455,3,B0009GX1CY,This is a good movie.  With very very good acting.  Gene Hackman plays a 50 year married man having a mid life crisis.  He decides to leave his wife for a bar maid he just met.  And it shows the effects it has on his family and how different people react to it.  I don't remember when this movie was out.  And I had never even heard of it until I saw it on one of the cable channels.  But for one of these kind of movies it is very very good.,1525305600,,442,3.739130434782609

8060463,4,B0009GX1CY,"Wonderful slice-of-life movie: Hackman, Burstyn, and Ann Margaret all give fantastic performances",1475539200,,97,7.166666666666667
8060464,5,B0009GX1CY,"If you live in or around Seattle (and have for at least fifty years) this is a must see film. It deals with a middle aged couple coping with the after-math of an affair, and ultimate break-up of the marriage. It is unlike ""An Unmarried Woman"" because the focus is on the affair, and failings in the marriage. Gene Hackman is not handsome, or even sexy, which makes his affair with a forty-five year old Ann Margarett a bit hard to believe, but the acting is so good that we buy it all.

It is a good examination of blue collar marriage in the mid-eighties when women were still likely to think of themselves as an extension of their spouse. Ellen Burstyn, (the spurned wife) plays this role superbly - she is devastated not only at losing her husband, but losing her sense of self. Gene Hackman is amazed that he has landed an exciting new love (Ann Margarett), and distraught at what his decision has meant for his family (all the kids are grown, but still very close). His oldest daughter played by Amy Madigan, (who received an Academy Award nom for best supporting actress for her performance) is especially furious at her dad's behavior, and not in small part because she is suffering through growing pains in her own marriage.

There is a great scene with footage of the early days of the Seahawks, and the old Kingdome (which has long since been demolished), so if you live around Seattle this is a real treat. The acting combined with a good story, and some great shots around Seattle have made this one of my favorite films. This could have been my family (I suspect it could be many families) story.",1473552000,,1609,4.506849315068493
