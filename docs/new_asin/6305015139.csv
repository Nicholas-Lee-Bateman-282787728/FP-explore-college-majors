950397,5,6305015139,"Exactly right! It is the best of. You can finds of great World Wrestling Federation action on this tape. Includes greats like Shawn Michales, The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kane, Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant,  Macho Man Randy Savage, Ultimate Warrior, Bret ""Hit Man"" Hart,  and many more! I recomend if you never seen how the WWF started out with  the leadership of Mr. Vince McMahon, then get this video because you will  see how the biggest annual event in sports-entertainment grew bigger and  bigger each year. From Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant in front 93,000+ to  the clash of The Undertaker and Kane. This is a great video! For even more  action every week watch WWF RAW IS WAR on the USA NETWORK @ 8:00pm  Eastern\7:00pm Central for two hours!!!",914716800,,764,4.69172932330827
950398,2,6305015139,"Considering that the average ""Wrestlemania"" is usually a three-hour affair and considering the fact that ""Wrestlemania"" has been an annual event for well over a decade, it's hard to conceive that  a 60-minute video can adequately cover ""the best"" of an event  that changed sports entertainment history and made wrestling a staple of  pay-per-view TV. You don't really get the best of Wrestlemania --instead  you get the best highlights of Wrestlemania. There's not a complete match  to be found on this tape. This video may entertain the most casual of  wrestling fans but solid wrestling fans may be irritated by the brief  glimpses of some of the best wrestling to be found. (One glaring omission:  The Savage-Steamboat match on the 1987 card --a match considered to be one  of the greatest in wrestling history!) More satisfying are the ""Best  of"" series from the WCW --the matches are edited but much more  satisfying to watch. Still, the ""Best of Wrestlemania"" may serve  as a primer to the uninitiated.",912470400,10,1008,4.970059880239521
950461,2,6305015139,"this video didn't show enough of what u want to see,it showed some good matches,but mainly the whole thing was talking.if u ask me it isn't worth 10 dollars.so use your money to get something better like a yo-yo or  something. IF u smell what thew ROOOOOOCCCCCKKKKK is cooking!!!",930787200,,279,4.6938775510204085
950462,4,6305015139,"I have watched Wrestlemania for the past 14 years and some of the best matches were not even mentioned. True, some of the interviews and highlights were good but there was wrestling before 1990.",921110400,,194,4.735294117647059

7880939,5,6305015139,"If anyone is a fan of the old ""Main Event Wrestling"" which morphed into the World Wrestling Federation, this dvd is a must have.  This dvd provides a history of many of the characters I grew up with in the 60's and 70's when one could only see wrestling on t.v. on Saturday night starting at 10:00 p.m. CST.  Any fan of wrestling entertainment; especially the evolution of WrestleMania, needs a copy of this one.  It is awesome and full of history for the rabid fan; that I am!",1473724800,,477,4.337078651685394
7880940,4,6305015139,"I bought this for my nephew who just loved it! His father's nephew was John ""Earthquake"" Tenta of the WWF & so this is rather a special video for our family. Sadly we lost John in 2006 to cancer but we can relive his moments of triumph & yes  failure too in this video.",1379635200,,269,3.9814814814814814
7880941,4,6305015139,I owned this on video cassette. They added a couple more matches to this dvd release which is fine but I don't believe they mesh well with the original release.,1379289600,,160,4.366666666666666
7880942,5,6305015139,"I thought this was going to be filled with matches and another 3-disc set. I was wrong. Still I was hopeful and with good reason. I noticed they showed some, if not the best, matches out of the Wrestlemanias provided. Not only that they skipped through the matches showing only the high-points of the matches and the endings. Brilliant!!! That's what I do anyway. Some of those matches were 40-60 minutes and I'll fall asleep before I see who won. There is a mixture of the most loved superstars in the world on the DVD from wrestling to football to music. I'm talking, Ray Charles,Cindy Lauper,Salt'N'Pepa,Lawrence Taylor,Refridgerator Perry,Mr. T,Mike Tyson,all my favorite wrestlers from over the years and more! If I didn't have the DVD already, I'd buy it again.",1260144000,,767,4.907692307692308

7880944,2,6305015139,"Despite the fact that it says the best, this video fails to include such matches as Ricky ""the Dragon"" Steamboat against Randy ""Macho  Man"" Savage or even Bret Hart against Owen Hart.  This video  recognizes the Ladder match as well as the Iron Man match but most of this  video is tiresome and boring.  Not recommendable.",965433600,7,322,4.678571428571429
7880945,4,6305015139,"But only SOME of the best of Wrestlemania I-XIV. There are great matches on here, but there are a lot more NOT on here. Regardless, it is an excellent tape.",963619200,3,156,4.233333333333333
7880946,1,6305015139,I thought the video would've been better if they would've shown more wrestling than talking. I wanted to see some wrestling. Over all the video was stunk!,944956800,9,154,4.7407407407407405
