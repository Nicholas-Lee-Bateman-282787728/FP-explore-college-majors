I'd never heard of the other three films, but after reading about them on the web I decided to order. After watching them, I can recommend three to fans of independent films with a difference, and the fourth will be pure gold to fans of over-the-top Euro-trash films of the 70's.

Mad Foxes, a Spanish/Swiss production was released in 1981, but reeked of the 70's to me. After a biker gang brutally rapes the hero's too young girlfriend, the rest of the movie is a series of tit for tat revenge scenes with non-stop violence, brutality (including a penisectomy in close-up!) and nudity, both male and female. Very little cinematic skill, ridiculous dubbing, and atrocious music. At least it was short. Not to my taste, but I know some people will love every minute of it. * out of ****

Accion Mutante is the first feature by lex de la Iglesia. I've seen three later films by him (Day of the Beast, Dance with the Devil, 800 Bullets), and all were very good. This is a sci-fi action comedy about a gang leader, fresh out of jail, who organizes a kidnapping with his followers. While escaping on their spaceship, he betrays the gang members who helped him pull it off, before landing with the kidnapped girl on a planet with no women. The film is enjoyable, with reasonably good production and effects. It is the only one of the four films to be a second rate transfer. While in widescreen (looks like 2:35) it appears to be taken from a VHS tape. Dialogue is in Spanish with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. *** out of ****

Revenge of Billy the Kid is from the hillbilly horror genre. The degenerate, dysfunctional family of old farmer MacDonald lives in filth, guzzles moonshine, and kept reminding me of the farm family in Poor White Trash, Part 2. The big difference is that this is a British film! It's as far from typical British horror (Hammer, Tyburn, Amicus) as you can get. After the farmer has his way with a goat, daughter Ronnie (all his kids are named Ronald) raises the mutant goat to full kidhood, while trying to protect it from taunts and mistreatment from her brothers Ronald. Eventually, Billy the Kid gets his revenge. Very enjoyable gross-out horror comedy. *** out of ****

I first saw Liquid Sky in the early 80's when it was a hit on the art house circuit. Tiny aliens land on a rooftop in New York City looking to get off on their favorite drug, a chemical produced it the brain of someone experiencing an orgasm. And, boy, did they land on the right roof! The style of the film may appear very strange now, but it perfectly captures the oh-so-hip artist/modeling/creative world of 1980 New York. Anne Carlisle is great in the dual lead roles of Margaret and Jimmy. Low budget special effects are colorful and intriguing, and the synthesizer score (based on themes by Carl Orff) is effective. **** out of ****

All in all an entertaining package of four little known, hard to find films.",1318982400,12,3007,4.571428571428571
