Using paper mach&eacute; techniques, Felice and her class turn a stack of newspapers into a globe, a chick, a dinosaur, a telephone, and so much more. And that's just one of the projects. The program clearly shows 5-11 year-old kids how to unleash their creativity in projects like:
--turn newspapers into creative paper mach&eacute; sculptures
--making printing plates from cardboard boxes
--using scraps to make beautiful new creative paper
--building a piggy bank from a plastic gallon milk container
--and basic art supplies
--a ""clean your room collage"" which starts with kids cleaning their room to find 15 things they would normally throw away
--and a lot more!",1043107200,,919,5.216216216216216
