Robin Williams does a great job of depicting all of the characters' voices and personalities in this wacky yet lovable version of the popular Russian folktale!!! I almost died laughing at the scene where the Tsar thought his advisor said ""phesants"" when he actually said ""peasants."" This is an absolute classic that you can't stop watching for all time!!!!",1084665600,2,485,4.785714285714286
