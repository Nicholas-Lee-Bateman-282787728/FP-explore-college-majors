8225515,1,B000WTZ6BW,"I cannot believe the price of this workout. It does not worth that much at all. Besides of price, the workout must be for people with serious back injuries. I do not stand straight and through this work out would help my posture. It did nothing. It is boring as hell and it is so basic, it is even less then basic it is some very slow movements that resembles Pilates movements. I am willing to give it away for free, just pay for shipping, and it will be yours. I only watched one time and it was enough for me,",1318464000,,512,4.079207920792079
8225516,2,B000WTZ6BW,This might be a good DVD to purchase if you are starting from zero. Anyone who isn't injured or under 45 will not benefit from these exercises.,1239062400,2,143,4.333333333333333
8225517,4,B000WTZ6BW,"I suffer from chronic back pain, particularly soreness and stiffness upon waking, due to disc issues and mild arthritis, all related to a long-ago injury. I have been shocked that this DVD has been great for relieving my pain and giving me greater mobility - way more than the chiropractor I've been seeing - and I've only been using it for four days!

PROS:
- This is a workout anyone can do. I had my 3.5 year old and my mother who is in her 60s on the floor doing the DVD with me. The exercises are simple and easy to follow and not too strenuous save for a few, but with each one, you can go at your own pace and work up to more challenging stretches. I will admit that I had expected to work a lot harder than I did, and therefore did not expect the positive results that I have already experienced.  However, it's worth noting that the instructor gives and shows instructions on how to make each exercise more challenging, which was appreciated.
- It's a quick workout. The workout is divided into two sections and also has some additional instructional material. When completing both workout sections (which I would recommend as both serve important purposes) it does not take long at all - maybe a half hour?

CONS:
- I did not like at all the fact that the instructor advises you with each exercise that you can ""work up to"" a certain number of reps with each exercise. For example she will say ""work up to 10"" but will only demonstrate five before moving on to the next exercise. I guess you are supposed to pause the DVD if you want to complete the entire set of reps, but that is annoying to have to do.

All in all, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone seeking relief from their back pain. It's a structured program with both strengthening and stretching work - essential for building a strong defense against the dreaded back pain so many of us suffer.",1218326400,5,1873,4.389048991354467
8225518,2,B000WTZ6BW,"I bought this with my 13 year old daughter in mind since I am constantly nagging her to straighten up.  Rather than continue on this path, I thought she could benefit from some Pilates exercises, particularly one with this title.  We started to watch it and frankly was so bored that I of course could not expect her to do it. It certainly is not stimulating for a very young audience (or even for me and I am most definitely middle aged). There is probably an audience out there but it's not us.",1202860800,,496,4.32258064516129
8225519,5,B000WTZ6BW,"This DVD was very beneficial to me in strengthening my lower back after an injury. The DVD has a menu so you can go directly to the program you want. There are three parts to this DVD. The first section is a lengthy lesson on proper alignment and form during the exercises. Watch it a time or two and then you can proceed to the workouts. The next section is a workout is filmed in a garden setting. The music and setting are very relaxing and the movements are adaquately slow for someone with a bad back. The third section is a second workout filmed indoors. It also has a relaxing setting and music and the pace was not too fast. The instructors voice is pleasant but she has a definate english accent. I didn't find this to be a problem. She explains the moves well and is easy to listen to. The DVD doesn't contain any ""extras"" just the two workouts and the lesson at the beginning. I found it perfect for gently strengthening my back without adding furthur injury. I am new to pilates and found I could do most all of the moves. I liked that the program was relaxing and could be done before bedtime as well as during the day. I felt it was well worth the cost of the DVD. I would also recommend the DVD set ""Posture, Get It Straight!""  by Janice Novak, also available on Amazon. This one is not for recupperating injured backs but is the best program out there for strengthening the whole back and quickly improving one's posture. You would want to use it when your back is not hurting. Check out the reviews for that one for more detailed info.",1202256000,10,1552,4.315068493150685
