8338054,4,B001RIGDAA,"My wife & I have watched both this Vol. 1 & also Vol. 2. This show is an outrageous display of men dancing female ballet roles. I had my 25 year old daughter who takes ballet classes watch. Her first comment was, ""They have a bulge beneath their tutu. Ballet is supposed to create straight lines & grace."" She then stated, ""You wouldn't think they would be that good."" It is true you never mistake them for women till you see a wide shot & you may forget who is dancing.

The dancer's, costumes, choreography & individual personalities involved in this are on display & first rate. If you like the unusual you'll love this but you'll probably get a kick out of it even if the unusual isn't normally for you. One sign of emerging talent is the product gets better over time. Volume 2 displays a maturing of dance but is at least as outrageous as Volume 1 & I think it is more so. This show & 2 are colorful, funny, cute & well performed. Afterwards I was struck by the amount of money that was risked to begin this troupe. What Balls!",1264377600,5,1033,4.270408163265306
