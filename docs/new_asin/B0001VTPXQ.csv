8363768,5,B0001VTPXQ,"This video series provides a good description of Canada's role in WWII which, in typical Canadian fashion, has often been underplayed. It tells their story through a series of often touching, revealing, personable letters to home by the soldiers themselves. In one video, one soldier remarks how the Canadians were sometimes referred to as ""the SS troops of the British military"", implying that they could often get the job done through extensive and careful planning beforehand. Enjoy!",1506643200,,486,5.324675324675325
