2189285,3,B0006IUE20,I had never seen this movie before and thought it would be along the lines of what I have seen Like Jason movies but was not what I expected it was kind of boring,1419206400,,162,3.7941176470588234
2189286,2,B0006IUE20,"Poor quality, difficult to see faces",1415923200,,36,5.166666666666667
2189287,2,B0006IUE20,The cinematography was too old.  Couldn't hardly see the characters.  I only watched the first 10-15 minutes.  Didn't enjoy it.,1396396800,,127,5.25
2189288,2,B0006IUE20,I did not think was as old a movie as it was. I might watch it when I am in the mood for that kind of movie.,1380585600,,108,3.037037037037037
2189289,4,B0006IUE20,I was bored and decided to view this movie from the past. I was surprised. It kept my attention and good story line.,1360454400,2,116,4.086956521739131

8041685,3,B0006IUE20,the plot and special effects are good for the time of production but the quality of the DVD itself was poor ; a bit faded and grainy perhaps there is a digitally enhanced version?,1482019200,,179,4.294117647058823
8041686,5,B0006IUE20,These are my kind of movies.,1477699200,,28,3.8333333333333335
8041687,1,B0006IUE20,"I tried to watch it.  Couldn't do it though.  First, it was on the same level as a spaghetti western type movie. It was all Italian long before Italian directors had a clue.  I may have considered two stars just for the heck of it......but.....naw.  Twenty years ago I may have given it two stars, but not today.
Take from that what you will.",1476403200,,342,4.296875
8041688,1,B0006IUE20,"About as poor of a copy of this movie you will never watch. Perhaps it's a cult classic? I don't know, I didn't even make 5 minutes in.",1456617600,,135,3.857142857142857

8041690,2,B0006IUE20,There were no giants and the acting was terrible.,1453507200,,49,4.555555555555555
8041691,4,B0006IUE20,"The story of Jason and the Argonauts how could you not appreciate it. granted it had a  lot to be desired, used the same plot line as most of these Italian films, but it was an absolute pleasure to watch the myth come to life. They were missing some of the more Heroic Argonauts like Hercules and such, but the story was decent and the effects, although nothing really fancy managed to  fit the movie and of course the bad guys die at the end.",1440374400,2,443,4.2
8041692,1,B0006IUE20,Not even on the level of The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad or Jason And The Argonauts. Terrible movie.,1438214400,,97,4.444444444444445
