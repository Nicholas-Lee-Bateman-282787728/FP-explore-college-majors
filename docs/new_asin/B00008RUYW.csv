7986677,2,B00008RUYW,"It's kind of interesting that Abel Ferrara stands behind this film since it's a shameless rip-off of his films 'King of New York', 'China Girl', and 'Bad Lieutenant'. (In the commentary track the director compares the two films so many times that you wish Abel would tell him to shut the hell up). As the film opens we witness a racist, drunk cop (Jan Michael Vincent) strangle a black driver to death and plant drugs on him. A speedy trial follows which finds the cop cleared of any wrongdoing. This pisses off the victim's family so they team up with some gangsters and vow to kill him. The only problem is they can't get close enough to him. This is where Brian (Johnny Green) comes in. Brian is a small time thief and dope dealer who regularly sells to the gangsters. In the midst of all his illegal activities Brian falls for a cute blond named Amy (Alison Lohman). Amy is just getting out of an abusive relationship with her ex, a neo Nazi named Cole (Jonathan Avildsen). When Cole finds out another man (an Italian no less) is moving in on his girl he gets a couple of his followers together and they jump Brian. Desperate for protection Brian goes to his gangster friends and a deal is made: They'll take care of Cole for him if he'll kill the cop for them. Even though the film has none of Abel's style or substance it works at times. Green and Avildsen, far from good actors, are effective in their leading roles. The revelation is Lohman in her first starring role. She proves she's more than a pretty face by showing a wide range of emotions. A lot of bad stuff happens to Amy and Lohman has to go to some pretty dark places. She pulls it off convincingly. Out of everyone involved she's the only one whose gone on to a successful career. The real bonus of this movie and more specifically DVD is an Abel commentary. If you've heard his tracks for 'Driller Killer' or 'King of New York' you know that no one rocks a commentary like he does. However since he's joined by the film's director and executive producer he's far more restrained than if it was just him. Granted he doesn't say a whole lot but what he does is often funny and informative in regards to him offering advice to a first time director. It's pretty funny hearing the executive producer Johnny Cha Cha trying to cajole Abel for a comment only to have Ferrara ignore him. (Turns out the two men have worked together several times over the years). In the end as the credits roll Abel claims to like the movie and love all the actors. So if you're an Abel fan you owe it to yourself to give the movie a try and see if you agree with him.",1251504000,,2614,4.358606557377049

Sure, it's low-budget (hell Jan-Michael Vincent is in it!) so it's not Lord of the Rings or anything but it does portray gritty street and home life in LA and generally, modern sububia. There is a latino edge and race cards are played all over the film but it blows something like the commercially lauded ""American beauty"" away. Okay so this won't win an Oscar, but that's exactly why I rent or buy a film -- because some academy says it's outstanding. I like realistic movies and this is one. Kinda in the vein of another Ferrar flick, Bad Lieutenant. Gritty. Realistic. Multiple plotlines intertwined. This is what I like in a film so I do recommend it.",1113350400,3,795,4.6453900709219855
7986679,5,B00008RUYW,"Alison Lohman rocks in this movie. She is a great actress , and really makes you feel scared for her. I saw her first in White Oleander , and watch everything she is in. If you love Alison Lohman like I do , watch this movie.",1093651200,5,225,3.9130434782608696
7986680,1,B00008RUYW,"DO NOT be led into checking this piece of ca-ca out because it has Abel Ferrara's name attatched to it (what the hell was he thinking?).  This movie is HORRIBLE.  Not, ""bad""....HORRIBLE!!!  Totally unwatchable and lame.  It really deserves 0 stars but Amazon wouldn't let me choose that.",1073260800,,287,4.916666666666667
