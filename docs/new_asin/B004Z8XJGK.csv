8449535,5,B004Z8XJGK,"In my opinion, SUPER WHY! - Learning Adventures Tool Kit is the best DVD to teach our children the ABC's in a fun and happy way. This DVD recorded some good series from the SUPER WHY! cartoons on PBS kids so that a lot of kids can learn their ABC'S from watching them and observing those letters in an adventurous way. These fun-loving characters also talk to you to help them solve their problems from time to time. This can be the best gift you give your child when he or she is beginning to develop that small mind of theirs. Help them achieve their goals as parents, just give them a little push into KNOWLEDGE which is all they need from you.",1370131200,,647,4.2682926829268295
