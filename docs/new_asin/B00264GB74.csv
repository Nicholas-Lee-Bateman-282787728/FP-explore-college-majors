3850754,3,B00264GB74,"I'd highly recommend seasons 1 - 5, all the seasons before Sergeant Scott. These were highly entertaining, very typical British murder mysteries, in the spirit of the original books.

Season 7 started poorly and finally got so bad with the 5th episote (The Straw Woman) that I'll not watch any further. The storyline is virtually always ""Christians hate homosexuals and they're all crazy Bible-thumping hypocrites."" I can take a bit of that because there are crazies everyplace, and it is, after all, a British murder mystery. But the story line has taken on the modern culture, where gay is the way and sexual immorality of all kinds is just fine, thank you.

It's robbed these fine actors of a real story and made them mouthpieces for the writers of these screenplays.

Sad. Angering, to be sure. Disappointing, if not surprising.

I gave three stars only because it's mediocre--a prime example of the tripe we get over here on TV.",1342569600,8,933,4.849056603773585
3850755,5,B00264GB74,"Midsomer Murders is a fine example of British cozy mysteries (inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham), without going over the top on the gore factor. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside. The murders can be grisly, but this is often offset by the scenic country setting, and the witty dialogue (Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes via instant download for free).

DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) leads a relatively contented life with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark - the couple have one grown daughter, Cully) and works for the Criminal Investigation Department. From seasons 1-6, DCI Barnaby was assisted by his detective sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), and the pair found themselves going all over the county investigating the strangest and at times grisliest murders in little hamlets with innocent sounding names. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. In Season 7, Troy gets promoted, and Barnaby eventually gains a new assistant DS Dam Scott (John Hopkins).

The episodes in Season 7 are:
The Green Man
Bad Tidings
The Fisher King
Sins of Commission
The Maid in Splendour
The Straw Woman
Ghosts of Christmas Past

There is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the atmospheric music. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting story lines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting.",1328832000,11,1842,4.9546925566343045
3850756,5,B00264GB74,"Television's most murderous county is Midsomer, England, and the show has been solving multiple murders in episodes for over a decade. John Nettles, Midsomer's DCI Tom Barnaby, is the cop leading the investigation team. Expect some smiles (& LOL), a touch of romance, some awesome scenic footage of beautiful village life in England, of course crime mystery, some blood-but not too much, and a sensational support cast with always the sub-plots through relationships.  If you are new to Midsomer Murders, they are based on books by Caroline Graham. And many leading British guest stars, as huge stars beg to be on an episode to kill or be killed.
I have never watched a less-than GREAT episode of Midsomer Murders.",1323820800,3,714,5.0

The gore is kept to a minimum even though there are often multiple murders, some quite ingenious.  The comedy is kept at a reasonable level as is the Barnaby family interaction.  So far, all the episodes we have seen (which range from 7-8 per series) have been thoroughly enjoyable.",1509062400,,380,4.641791044776119

Working around a small company of permanent characters the writers never forget that this is about ""mystery.""  In contrast to American crime dramas the viewer must work along with the detectives to solve the mystery.  The. clues are usually well placed, among a good measure of "" red herrings. ""  If you spend a great deal of your time wrestling with complex and difficult scientific, social, and financial matters Midsomer in season 7 remains a pleasant refuge for the last hours before bedtime.

I must admit I can't resist a good murder mystery with some kinkiness, humor, whacky characters and well written plots--Midsommer has it all. The stock cast of John Nettles as DCI Barnaby, his revolving sidekicks, Troy, Scott and Jones, terminally cheerful and culinary challenged wife Joyce, doting daughter and aspiring actress, Cullie and dogged pathologist George Bullard are all  consistently excellent.

3850862,5,B00264GB74,"Watching these uncut, formerly PBS-issued, DVD's are wonderful. PBS forced us to watch their pleas for money to support them....even though the government.....our money....is already funding them.  After viewing these reissued ones, we learned how much was lost due to the cut scenes.
Beautifully done, countryside lovely and good mysteries!",1461024000,,341,5.82
