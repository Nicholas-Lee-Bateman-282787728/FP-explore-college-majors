2492029,5,B000E5LF0A,"Pros: The only Patlabor movie worth keeping, more action, Kanuka Klancy makes an appearance, the robots, and the storyline.

Cons: The finale and Shinobu.

Final Verdict: It's worth it, but don't waste your time on the sequels.",1194566400,,227,5.108108108108108
2492030,5,B000E5LF0A,"This is the way ""Patlabor 1"" _should_ have been treated in an English-language release.  This film is the foundation of Mamoru Oshii's signature style, which would be perfected in ""Patlabor 2"" and then reach international attention with the later ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Innocence"" features.

The new translation of the dialogue offers far more detail than the old version from the late '90s by Manga Entertainment, Bandai Visual USA seems to have really wanted to make a mark with this first release for the new company, and they achieved this.

The film itself is a classic Oshii blend of philosophy and action, based upon the characters he helped introduce with the ""Patlabor: The Original Series"" OVA, but turning the focus of the show from the adventures of the Patlabor cast to an introspective look at where Tokyo (and humanity in general) was heading.  Many elements were far ahead of their time; today threats of killer computer viruses are common; all of us deal with them in our email accounts, but in 1989 the internet was in its early public infancy, and the idea of someone creating a virus to spread death and destruction was a fantastic concept.  The fact that humanity's inventions could so easily be taken from their pure helpful purposes and turned to nefarious ends was a relatively new idea, one which challenged the prevailing viewpoint that humanity would only be helped and assisted by its new technological creations.

This release sets a new standard for how high-profile titles should be released, and I hope that it is a precedent that will be followed commonly.  The documentaries on the extra disc were a little underwhelming compared to the standards set by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" or even the well-conceived and excuted making-of documenatries that came with Pioneer/Geneon's ""WXIII: Patlabor 3"" special edition release.

But the 184-page Patlabor Archives book is a treasure for those interested in how and why ""Patlabor 1"" turned out the way it did, detailing much of the history of the film, why it is so different in tone from the Patlabor OVAs and TV series, and the innovative ways that Oshii used to turn the city of Tokyo itself into one of the central characters of the film.  I read the entire booklet before watching the new version of the film, and it changed the way I viewed the movie, made me far more conscious of the social commentary that is in fact one of the film's central themes.

The storyboard is another gem for those who are interested in the process of how an idea for a film is translated into a finished work, and even glancing through it made me more conscious of some of the finer details in the film, things which are so subtle that they may escape detection even after multiple viewings, but because they were specifically laid out in the storyboards were deliberately placed to enhance some aspects of the film.

Is this Limted Edition of the film necessary to enjoy the picture?  No, it's not.  Get the new version of the basic movie if all you're interested in is a great thinking-man's movie with a few heart-pounding action sequences thrown in for variety's sake (it _is_ a mecha anime on the surface, after all).  The basic film of this Bandai Visual USA version is far superior to the old Manga Entertainment one; if you already own that, you might consider picking up this one, anyway, because this translation mentions an awful lot of details that were left out of Manga's version.  But the Limited Edition's special features will probably only be of interest to the devoted anime and Patlabor fans, for its illumination of how the anime industry and Mamoru Oshii actually work.

The downside of this, for those who have been following Patlabor for a long time, is that this is the fourth complete English-language cast for the Patlabor characters, a result of four different companies having been responsible for releasing this over time (Manga Entertainment doing the original versions of the first two movies, US Manga Corps doing the OVAs and TV Series, and Pioneer/Geneon doing WXIII: Patlabor 3).",1146096000,28,4090,4.84648493543759

The character development is great but the pace of the story is not working for me. A lot of slow/talking parts and only limited action from the mechs. Wasn't as impressed as 20 years ago.",1455926400,,325,4.52542372881356

The storyboard booklet was Great. I want to photocopy it to look at it thoroughly and not damage the original. The other booklet contains interviews which some are included in the extras disc.

2492087,3,B000E5LF0A,"This review is for the blu-ray version.

PROS:
- Phenomenal movie. Enough said.
- Video quality is good. Although the artifacts is mainly from the age of the anime not so much of the transfer itself.
- Audio is good. Appreciate that there is a dub for those who prefer dubs.

CONS:
- Packaging is the most lackluster I have ever seen. No insert for the left-hand side inside the case - not even a promotion for other anime blu-rays; absolutely nothing. See the plain photo.
- Subtitles are in the ugly, disgusting yellow color font. Weird part is that on screen text have white subtitles.

In conclusion, if you are coming from the Limited Edition DVD of Patlabor 1 and 2, then this is lackluster in the packaging experience. Otherwise beside the yellow subtitles font, the playback of the movie is fine.",1435795200,,804,4.608391608391608
2492088,5,B000E5LF0A,"The best Oshii movie, and one of the best animated movies ever.  5 Stars, highest recommendation.  I own this movie on VHS, ~5 different DVD versions & LD -- this version has the best video and great audio.",1432857600,,206,4.394736842105263
2492089,2,B000E5LF0A,"Look, everyone agrees the picture cleanup is great. The problem with this release is the re-dubbing. If, like myself, you prefer to listen to a movie instead of reading a movie, then you want a good quality dub. The previous version  didn't just sound better, it also made more sense and flowed with the other releases with the old cast. In this re-dubbing and from what some have said, re-translation, some of the dialog did not match what was happening in the scene or simply was written poorly. We all know that not everything can be translated or conveyed between languages and cultures, but why Maiden Japan decided to re-dub, I don't know. We can speculate but that's pointless with this incarnation. I'm not even going to blame the new voice cast since they're just spouting the new script and following the directions of the voice director, which made me cringe. Even the subs are the same as the dub, so any which way you look at it, you're not getting a good script to read. My suggestion, buy the dvd version. Older, but better dialog.",1432080000,6,1046,4.623655913978495
2492090,4,B000E5LF0A,"I saw this new release subtitled on Hulu Plus, and it indeed looks great for a film of its time (1989)- it's a great example of the top notch animation that really started to popularize Japanese animation in the late 80s, and this HD transfer looks to be quite good. Watching such high quality 100% hand drawn animation makes me sad that so much has gone CG these days.
As for the movie itself, and this is just my opinion, I found it to be pretty good, but not exactly great due to some odd pacing issues. I felt the middle portion of the movie dragged on too long needlessly at times (I found myself wanting/waiting for some action), and the finale was somewhat anticlimactic to me, which I won't go into due to spoilers. I also felt a disconnect between the serious tone of the film, and the silliness of the Patlabors themselves, ie the pilots heads are inexplicably fully exposed, that the labors use giant revolvers, etc...that kind of goofiness just undermined the serious tone of the film in my opinion. But it's a quality anime movie, and certainly worth a watch.",1430697600,2,1072,4.530927835051546

2492152,4,B000E5LF0A,"So much has already been said about how great this movie is, I don't feel I have much to add there.  It is indeed a must-see.  I have just recently discovered the Patlabor series and I am hooked.  It is one of the best series ever.
I am going to concern my review, then, with a quick comparison of the audio/video between this release and the Manga Video release.  First off, the audio.  (I am speaking purely about the Japanese audio; the English dubs for all Patlabor releases have been so excruciatingly awful that they are best simply ignored.)  If you are looking to watch the movie in its original Japanese soundtrack, you are out of luck.  What you have here (and in ANY 5.1 surround audio version of this film) is a Japanese track that was recorded years later, specifically so the DVD could have 5.1 sound.  It's not bad, and in fact is the exact same original Japanese cast, but I am simply trying to make fans aware who may wish to know about these things before they buy.  It is, in fact, a very well-done dub and in most cases is pretty close to the original, although there are lines that are noticeably different in their delivery (one that is nearly shouted as opposed to delivered more casually in the original, for example).  It would have been nice if they'd included the original Japanese stereo soundtrack, and there is plenty of unused space on this DVD, so data size is definitely not the issue.  If you are looking for the original Japanese soundtrack, the only US DVD release you can find it on is the now out of print Manga Video edition.
As for the video: yes, the remaster looks fantastic on this release, but in comparing it to the Manga release one thing becomes glaringly obvious.  The new remaster gives the movie a very washed out look, colour-wise.  The original has very bright, vibrant colours, but in the new video remaster they are very dull with much less contrast.  Of course, the actual detail and overall appearance of the video is vastly improved, but the colours are most definitely dull and washed out.  On the other hand, this DVD is enhanced for widescreen, so it will fill out your wide screen nicely, whereas the Manga release is not, so you get a small window in the middle of your TV with a black border all around.  Not cool, but I think it was released before widescreen TVs were very common, so they probably just weren't considering that back then.

So all in all, both releases have their pros and cons, and either one is a good buy.  But it would certainly be nice to see a DVD release that gives you the same widescreen-enhanced, beautiful remaster, but with the colours restored to their former glory, as well as the option for the original 2-channel Japanese audio in addition to the much-later 5.1 audio.  For all I know there are good technical reasons why this can't be; I have no idea, and am not knocking either release, but just giving customers all the knowledge which may help them choose one version over another, if they have a particular aspect of the film that is more important to them than others.  In the end, you can't lose with Patlabor.",1391212800,,3114,4.516934046345811

2492195,5,B000E5LF0A,"This...this is one of the best DVDs ever.  The movie is fantastic, with a great plot and excellent animation quality.  The music score by Kenji Kawaii (Ghost In The Shell, When They Cry) perfectly captures the mood of each scene and sequence, and the character interactions, not to mention the characters themselves, are very entertaining to watch.  I'll be honest, though, I had seen Patlabor the Movie 2 and WXIII before I ever saw this film.  I had seen an abridged version of the film on YouTube before watching this, although I was still able to get the general idea of the plot thanks to that.  Despite all of the acclaim that Mamoru Oshii, the director, might get for his work on Ghost In The Shell, Patlabor (and P2) are probably some of his best work.  The plot is a great detective plot, just with giant robots.  The fact that the changes in society caused by the integration of Labors (the name for these mecha in the franchise) are treated as a part of life is what makes Patlabor so different from other mech shows.  The labors are part of everyday life, and so new schools for operating them and jobs related to labors seem natural, and that is also what helps the plot so well.  I really don't want to spoil it, but if something like a specific frequency caused by wind can make a robot go berserk thanks to a code written in its software, then what happens when the robots found all around you, in construction sites and police departments, also receive a new upgrade with the same software and problem?

The DVD has a nice silver colored casing, and there are two discs.  The first disc contains the film, with the original Japanese language track and a new English dub.  This English dub was apparently made by professionals, since I can recognize some of the voices, and every character has a vocie that fits their personality just right.  The Japanese track is, of course, the go to track, but I feel that both tracks are equal in terms of performance quality, and also in terms of audio quality as well.  The Japanese track also has optional subtitles.  There are also several Japanese theatrical trailers for the film as well.  The second disc has a documentary.  The DVD also comes with two booklets.  The first one is basically the making of the film in text and image form, and it's great to read.  It has a lot of information on the film, and it's very well written.  The second booklet has dozens and dozens of storyboards, all with translation notes and whatnot.  The discs themselves are held in a book-like case, similar to what Classic Media used for their Rodan/War of the Gargantuas DVD set.

Overall, this is an excellent DVD for an excellent movie.  I Highly recommend it for anyone who's even remotely interested in anime or robots, or perhaps even robotic engineering!  It's that good of a movie.",1357084800,,2833,4.58648111332008
