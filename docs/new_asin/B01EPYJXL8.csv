7739350,2,B01EPYJXL8,"I was looking forward to receiving this nugget from the past.  I went through the preorder and everything.  Received it last night, unwrapped, and was disappointed.  Vol 1-5 is NOT season 1-5.  Partially my fault for not being thorough enough in my research.  for this price I might as well go to ebay and buy the 2009 individual seasons.  Poorly put together in volumes.  not seasons.  beware!!  (but enjoy)",1467763200,2,408,4.797101449275362
7739351,4,B01EPYJXL8,"Sony is re-releasing The Real Ghostbusters after the Time-Life edition of the cartoon has been out of print for several years. Each disc in this five disc set can be purchased separately, but it's much cheaper to purchase the boxed set. The next set of five discs will be out in September and that will leave enough episodes for volumes 11-15. If we get two more boxed sets like these, the overall costs will be approximate to the Time-Life Collector's set when it originally came out and a fraction of what that complete set currently goes for from third part retailers. So overall, if you missed out on the Time-Life version this is a decent purchase, but with room for improvement.

There are 11-12 episodes on each disc for a total of 58. I'm not sure why two discs only have 11 episodes as they could have easily fit in and it would have made things a perfect 60 episodes. This is all the more important when you realize the episodes are in chronological order and save for two episodes from Season 1 and 2 which are missing. They are just skipped right over for some reason. These episodes are ""Slimer, Come Home"" which should be with the season 1 disc (but that would put things at 13 on this disc) and ""Adventures in Slime and Space.""

While it's great to have these episodes, including the original Lorenzo Music voiced Peter in the Christmas episode instead of the redubbed Dave Coulier version, the picture quality is not as good as the Time-Life version. This is because they've crammed a lot more episodes on each disc so the visual quality had to lose something in this translation. Think of it like a Cookie Jar or Mill Creek cartoon release, where you are getting a lot of episodes for a lot less money, but the quality suffers. Still, if you know this going in, you won't be too upset. That said, I really feel they should have remastered these episodes for this release as the age, wear and tear really shows at times. Hopefully the Heathcliff set I'll be picking up in August from Mill Creek won't share a similar fate.

So yes, the visual quality has taken a hit and two episodes are missing from the chronological order, but 58 episodes of The Real Ghostbusters for 30-46 dollars (depending on where and when you purchase this) is a really good deal no matter how you slice things. It's still less than a dollar per episode, which is fantastic, especially if you go looking for the Time Life set and its third party overpricing. I'm glad I picked this up for as cheap as a I did and I'm hoping the next wave of five releases get a bundled boxed set as well.",1467676800,22,2578,4.469214437367303

My 3 year old daughter for some reason likes Ghostbusters and I bought this set, especially after seeing that a Time-Life set goes for a small fortune. I read this one was not as complete, but it still has a lot of cartoons and in pretty good video and audio quality. I see that I'd still have to buy a few volumes separately if I want the whole series, but a great intro into the series at the very least.

7739394,4,B01EPYJXL8,"This set is a bargain and while I know it is a step down from the time life release, this offers more fans a chance to get to watch one of the best animated series of the 1980s.

The Real Ghostbusters was always one of the more creative and to me, one of the more adult animated series before that was a thing.  Notably, there are scenes that are somewhat terrifying.  The creators realized that the concept lends itself to all sorts of creativity, like living houses, possessions, and dreams becoming reality.

This set captures the best of the series, woth a few exceptions.  My favorite was always the Sandman episode.  Its on volume one of the set.

The show as a whole is great.  While the characters don't have the likenesses of the movies, the personalities are in tact.  Also, some of the best voice actors in the business provide their talents.  Lorenzo Music, of Garfield fame, Maurice Lamarche, Arsenio Hall, amd the legendary Frank Welker all provide their talents.  The writing is sharp amd while there are no extras, the value is amazing for the content you get.",1477094400,,1076,4.610526315789474

7739396,3,B01EPYJXL8,"This set contains only the first season, not the second. Also, the picture quality jumps up and down from a little brighter on one episode to less brighter for another. Obviously a different transfer of print material from the Time Life set which was superb. What they should have done was release a reprint of a 1980s toy that they sold on the shelves at the time the cartoon was on the air.

7739417,4,B01EPYJXL8,"I don't have a problem with this release at all.  As an avid old school cartoon collector, this was like the one series that I had been mulling over for some years about buying because of the price the original Time Life complete series was going for, and then once they stopped selling it, the outrageous prices other sellers were charging.  I personally was just not trying to drop the money for a series that I loved so much.  So when I randomly just stumbled on this I couldn't resist and pre-ordered it immediately.  Now I admit I like some did think it was the complete collection only because the listing was not very specific initially, but I'm cool with getting the second half when it drops in September.

The quality of the DVDs was decent, they are not remastered or anything but that's fine. I prefer an original resolution than some 4K remaster that looks like it was shot present day, for me it takes away from Thre nostalgia. The quality of the episodes video quality wise is decent. You get English and French subtitles and no foreign language dubs. I wish they would have included the Spanish dubs. The episodes are in no real order but then again the show was not episodic in that it continued where the previous episode left off. What you do get here is over 50 episodes of this classic show and until a complete season boxed set gets rereleased this is all we are getting and it's better than nothing.",1468281600,6,926,4.421052631578948

7739424,4,B01EPYJXL8,"First of all, I find it unfair that people are giving this 1 star because they're ignorant about what is included. You get just over 50 episodes, not the entire series like people assume. With just a tad bit of research of what you're about to purchase, you should be able to figure it out.

With that said, I'm pretty happy with what I got. I've loved this show ever since I was a kid, but I'm not shelling out hundreds of bucks for the Time Life set that is no longer available. The picture quality in this set appears to be fine and the sound is on par with what I expect from 80s cartoons. No complaints here. My main gripe is that Sony removed the title cards that come after the opening sequences. Not a huge deal, but I always dug that little melodic bit that played over the title. Oh well. Secondly, the selection screen/menu has some of the corniest music I've ever heard - not sure why they would choose something so bland and non-ghostbusters sounding. Not a huge deal, but still... they could have given that area a little more attention.

Overall, I'm satisfied and happy. These are some of the best episodes in the series. From my understanding, a similar set following up on this one will be released in September. I plan on purchasing that.",1467936000,11,1257,4.413793103448276
7739425,5,B01EPYJXL8,Great set. Can't wait for more. Contains 58 episodes.,1467849600,6,53,5.0
7739426,3,B01EPYJXL8,"It seems some buyers didn't realize what they were getting. No, you are not getting the complete series with this set. That was very clear from the press release and item description. These are one DVD per jewel case. Each DVD has about 11-13 episodes on them. There are no extras, and the discs have no disc art. They have The Real Ghostbusters lettering on them in black font, so it is nothing special. This is a big step down from the Time Life set, but it is supposed to be. These are meant to sell for a lot less, which might bring more buyers to the table. So if you have the Time Life set, this set is not for you. Plus, as I said, it only includes up to part of the syndicated season, which is often referred to as season two.

The box this comes in is rather flimsy. Again, this is not a collector's item. But at the price, I wouldn't expect it to be. The menus are a static image with options to play all, choose episodes, or select subtitles. There is a static image on the menu, not an animated menu with Real Ghostbusters music like what you find on the Time Life set. The music playing on the static menu is not from the show. Sony chose some generic music here that isn't the Ghostbusters theme, nor is it in any way related to the series. Odd choice. You get a 2.0 Dolby mix for the audio, same as the Time Life set.

Now, let's talk picture quality, which is the whole reason I bought this set. I'll say that having only watched five episodes to compare this with the Time Life set, the picture quality varies. Overall, the Time Life set is more consistent. This set varies. Some episodes actually look better with this set. So Sony didn't just port those transfers over. They seem to have at least done some color correction, and possibly some digital noise reduction (DNR). The episodes on this set compared to the Time Life set have less grain, and the colors pop more. There does seem to be a preference of leaning more towards the red color spectrum. In The Collect Call of Cthulu, Cthulu himself is much more red rather than a dark red from the Time Life series. When the Ghostbusters are standing in front of the roller coaster planning how to defeat him, you can see the color and detail under the roller coaster, which is not visible in the Time Life set. Even the green in the sky has more pop in this series than it does in the Time Life set. And in an early scene in that episode, there is clearly a very distinguishable difference in the color of the books. In the Time Life set, they all appear to be a dull brown, but in this set you can see different hues of green, orange and brown. So, this set looks better. On the other hand, The Thing In Mrs. Faversham's Attic there is very distracting sharpening turned up to 11, causing a white outline on every character through pretty much the entire episode. So the Time Life series wins this one. But that edge enhancement isn't on every episode of this series. Overall, I like the colors of the episodes in this set and the noise reduction is noticeable, but the episodes run at a bout a 2-4 MB/s bitrate, whereas the Time Life set runs at 4-6 MB/s, so this set is more compressed, and you may see more compression artifacts. But that isn't the only issue.

The bigger issue here is that episodes are missing. Namely, Slimer, Come Home, and Adventures In Slime And Space. So right of that bat you have omissions. The other issue is that the title cards are missing, which is extremely disappointing. As The Real Ghostbusters logo appears after the opening, they overlay this plain white boring jagged font over the logo that has the title with the writer credits. Could they really not spend the few seconds to put the actual title card in there? Come on! These two things alone are major missteps.

So, for the picture quality, I think this set is not bad. But the omissions of episodes, which we may not see if these DVDs don't get finished, and the title card issue are major problems. Sure, there are no extras, but that's what is expected. The packaging and presentation here is nothing stellar. In fact, it's why many fans are so glad that Time Life, not Sony, took on the role of producing the wonderful complete series set for the series. Time Life and Andy Mangels did a masterful job. Everything from the packaging to presentation to extras was top-notch on the complete series set. In my opinion, no other set comes close to it; not the Transformers Matrix of Leadership set, GI Joe footlocker, or any other collector's set has this much material in such an awesome packaging as the Time Life set. It was expensive at the time, but it is ridiculously expensive now that it is out of print. For what you were getting, it was outstanding. It will likely be the definitive set of the series.",1467849600,93,4778,4.395480225988701
7739427,3,B01EPYJXL8,The original released had five volumes. I never got all of them but then when this came out I thought great I can get it all now come to find out this volume 1 through 5 is the volume 1 and volume 2 from the original which means now we have to wait for more to come out to get them also this animated series version is missing 3 episodes why the hell are there 3 episodes missing hopefully the correct this when they come out with volume 6 through 10 if they come out with 6 through 10. It is a nice collection but if you really want all the Ghostbuster episodes you probably are better off to look for the original release of the animated series that came out years ago,1467763200,,670,4.045112781954887
