8439421,5,B004RZE2QM,"I don't usually buy dvd concerts with doing the needed research about the group i'm interested in, so that said, i took a chance on this band without doing any research and boy was i pleasantly surprised. this is a excellent concert. great singing by don ray as well as some stellar guitar playing by the band and guests. this is a straight ahead blues rock show from a very seasoned group. jump on board and take the don ray ride. you'll love it..............",1303603200,2,460,4.488095238095238
