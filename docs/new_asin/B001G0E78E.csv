This is encouraging more than anything because it shows that a faithfulness to God's Word and doing what it says can be so blessed by the Lord.  It is good to remember times like these, but it is even better to take a stand here and now and then watch God work in people's lives today.  It is also funny seeing some of the people from the footage now at church on Sundays...haha.  This is really cool, I wish it were longer!",1237939200,2,592,4.149122807017544
8303285,5,B001G0E78E,"How great to go back in time and watch this classic with Chuck Smith teaching and 70's bands playing music. Fun for those who were there to re-visit, and even better for those who weren't there to get a chance to experience it. This just proves how the Bible never changes and its truths are just as applicable today as they were years ago.",1237420800,2,340,4.328125
