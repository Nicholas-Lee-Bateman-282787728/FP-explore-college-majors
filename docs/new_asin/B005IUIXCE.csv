4710204,4,B005IUIXCE,"Very dark. Kept me on edge all the time. Great cast and acting (well, except for 50 ;)). You should watch it!",1320710400,,109,4.0
4710205,3,B005IUIXCE,"A desperate handyman steals an envelope containing information about a mysterious job that could pay a fortune.  Under a false identity, he finds himself as a participant in an underworld Russian roulette tournament where bettors gamble on who will survive. With the highest stakes imaginable - both good and bad -- and the belief that his odds are as good as anyone's, he plays this most deadly game.  A great cast, Jason Statham, Sam Riley, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Ray Winstone, Alexander Skarsgard, Mickey Rourke, inhabits this B noir on steroids.

See if you can find the original if this remake works for you.  It's even more intense.",1320537600,,641,4.907407407407407
4710206,3,B005IUIXCE,"""All players, eyes on the bulb, when it lights up you shoot."" After a impulse decision to steal a man's identity, Vince (Riley) becomes a contestant in a game of Russian roulette. The winner gets a little more then a million, the loser...dies. Never having seen the original I wasn't sure what to expect, and honestly I watched this because of Statham. The beginning was a little slow, but when the game started it really picked up and was interesting and very disturbing at the same time. Comparing this to ""Death Race"" I think is acceptable as it involves people doing their best to survive in a grotesque game. While ""Death Race"" was about cars and you had more of a separation from the killing, this one is in your face. Spin the chamber, cock the hammer, point at someone's head, while someone does the same to you, then shoot. Either you live for next round or you don't. This is a pretty good movie with a good cast (not counting 50 Cent) and is a neat idea. I just think it was missing something. I think it was making you feel for the characters. You just don't seem to care who lives or dies, and that hurts the movie. Overall, an entertaining movie that is worth watching, if for no other reason then morbid curiosity. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think so.

4710237,3,B005IUIXCE,"Many here have already summarized the plot so I will skip it. This movie focuses on the darkest side of human nature at its worst. You see people betting money on the life of others and seem to get a big thrill. It casts a very negative view on human nature - that those who are able to, enjoy watching others suffer. While the star of the movie is Sam Riley (he is a great actor, by the way) I watched this since I am a fan of Jason Stratham. If you are also a fan of Jason, please don't expect this to be his normal style of movies. This movie is not an action movie, it is more of a dark occult exploration into the narcissistic evil side of human nature in some. The cast of actors are all great - but what a waste that is. Two stars for the movie, rounded up to 3 stars due to an excellent cast.",1435795200,,800,3.914110429447853

Russian Roulette, he can't leave so he has to play as #13. These is some suspense and the performances are all right except for Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson and a horrifyingly sad looking Ben Gazzara?

But oh boy were we wrong. It is the worst movie we have ever seen. The plot is confusing with trivial side stories nobody cares about and in the end I was just hoping the main character actually shots himself in the head, so the movie can be over. Not so lucky though. Horrific waste of time.

The film was pretty good, it kicks off pretty splendidly and is carried along with some really good music.

There is a lot of urban riding as well as a lot on the mountain, I'd go with a near 50/50 mix, which was pretty cool to see.  They actually show quite a few crashes, which is rare in really put together films.  Its kinda cool to see these guys who are amazing also crash.

There were some short dialogue pieces tossed in the transitions, and you're never quite sure where they are boarding at, which would have been nice.

Over all really fun watch, but not as refined as say That's It That's All, or The Art of Flight.",1393200000,,785,4.193333333333333

4710261,2,B005IUIXCE,"This isn't a bad film just a dreary one.  Redeeming points are Mickey Rourke's turn as a prisoner in Mexico whisked away to play in a high stakes Russian roulette contest and Michael Shannon's bit as referee of said game of death.  Shannon's work reminded me of the sleazy emcee played by Gig Young in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"".  The ostensible lead, Sam Riley, reminded me physically of a young Kyle MacLachlan minus the charisma. Jason Statham and Ray Winstone are essentially wasted here. Ben Gazzara looks frail and almost unrecognizable in what was probably one of his last roles.  The positives aside are not enough for me to recommend the film which is deserved of its straight-to-video status.",1391904000,,708,4.875

You have a young man looking to get a lot of money quick so he enters a Russian Roulette contest against 13 people.  There are a lot of different versions played and the stress level is high.  Ultimately only one person is allowed to be left standing alive and no one can quit.  Not very good odds. It is very graphic and the actors/director do a nice job making it look like life for these people really doesn't mean anything.

4710279,3,B005IUIXCE,"13(released Oct/11)stars Sam Riley as Vincent ""Vince"" Ferro,Mickey Rourke as Patrick Jefferson,Ray Winstone as Ronald Lynn Bagges,Jason Statham Jaspar Bagges and a surprise appearance from veteran actor Ben Gazarra,as one of the bettors. 13 is one heck of a disturbing film that has its own tempo,and if you happen to get left behind,too bad. One must make alot of assumptions and put the pieces together as it goes. In other words,it makes you think on the fly. Sometimes a good thing,here not so good.
The story finds Riley as an electrician/renovator. He has a relative in the hospital for whom he must remortgage the house in order to pay his bills. One day on his job he overhears the house owner talking about the receiving of an envelope that will make him alot of money. The man suddenly dies and Riley grabs the envelope. Outside the authorities are monitoring the envelope's delivery and the person that will use it.
Riley gets home and opens it to find detailed instructions and a phone number. He follows them to a tee and gets picked up and taken to a remote house in the woods far away from New York City. It is there he finds out what it is that he has to do to earn the money. He has become the unwilling participant in a sick and deadly game of 13 man Russian Roulette. They stand in a circle,each with a gun pointed to the head of the one in front of them. They are told to cock their gun hammers,then wait for a round bulb with the mark of a spider on it,to come on. Then they simply shoot and see who drops dead. There are three initial rounds,with each man receiving one bullet on the first,two on the second and three on the third. The men come from varying backgrounds,some brought there against their free will and others willing participants. The survivors move on to the finale.
Statham has put his brother,who has been in and out of a psych hospital,in this sick game for three times running and who is the standing champ. He has made alot of money off of his brother. Riley on the other hand had no idea what it was all about and is at first extremely nervous and distraught. As the game progresses he becomes resigned to his fate and Statham's brother's taunts just steel his resolve to get through it. As it would happen,Riley and Winstone make it to the finale. Both men are given the necessary three bullets each,and stand facing each other and at the ready to shoot. When the bulb comes on,there are two empty clicks heard and both men stand. It then goes on to the next round and four bullets are given each man. When the bulb goes on Winstone lays dead on the floor and underdog Riley is the survivor. He is given $1,850,000 for his troubles. When those who bet heavily on him to win offer him a lift to the train station,he realizes they want his money. Riley sneaks away and gets to a train station.
While at the station the authorities move in on him. He temporarily ditches his money and is taken in for questioning. Riley plays dumb and is eventually let go. He gets his money,mails it home and hops aboard the train. Statham has lost not only his brother but millions of dollars and finds Riley and stalks him aboard the train. When the time is right Statham shoots Riley in the stomach several times and flees with the money bag(filled with just clothes and a stuffed animal).Before Riley dies he swallows his postal receipt so no one will know about the money. The film closing has Statham fleeing through a deserted pedestrian tunnel.
The film gets to its point in a quick enough fashion but its set up can leave one with alot of questions,questions which the film will not stop to answer and hopes either you pick up later on or somehow figure out on your own. There is no explanation at all to Rourke's character,just that he is some tough hombre' that was stewing in a Mexican jail for...who knows why? For some reason they gave Stathams brother's character(Winstone) some filling out as we are first introduced to him as just another participant. Then there's a flashback as to where he came from and how he got there,and it shows the tension between the two brothers. And that ending of Statham steeling away with what he thinks is Riley's winnings,leaves one scratching ones head. Statham disappears through the other end of the tunnel and the camera just hangs there watching for about 10 seconds.....then it suddenly fades to black.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There is a featurette and interviews. But for the most part,what is in the interviews is in the featurette! Kind of a waste of space,if you ask me.
All in all an uneven film with its premise,of men being either willing or unwilling participants in a human ring of Russian roulette,being a very disturbing one indeed.

After I saw it,  it reminded me of ""Deer Hunter"" movie by its powerful message. This film left lasting impression on me, because of its brutality and unmistakable originality of the story.

It is a story of a young man whose family is at odds after his father has serious accident that results in series of medical surgeries that are costly.  Then an opportunity arises that can provide a potential for earning lots of money in just a couple of days.  Compelled to help his family this young man starts a journey that will take him to a place he could not imagine in his wildest dreams.

4710287,2,B005IUIXCE,"There are few movies that I do not like.  I can sit and watch a chick flick like Notting Hill or Bridemaids and love it and then I can turn around and watch the Expendables and cheer with a Budweiser in hand.  I can see beauty in most stories told on stage and screen.  However, I just did not really feel it with this movie.

I had not seen the original of this movie and I was unaware that this was any sort of remake until I read the Amazon product review page.  For the most part, the story line was ""original"" to me.  The story is of an electrician whose father is in dire need of surgery.  The movie opens with him trying to figure out how they will pay for the surgery.  While on a job, the electrician, Vince Ferro, overhears the homeowner talking about making a large sum of money quickly.  The homeowner dies and Vince steals the message and takes the homeowners place.  He then find himself in an underground Russian Roulette game where the wealthy bring their ""players"" to the arena and bet on who will be left standing in the end.

Personally, I thought the story line at the beginning and the end of the movie were quite terrible.  To me, the whole dying father thing really did not add to the movie at all.  As a matter of fact, it reminded me a lot of an old Tales from the Crypt episode (Easel Kill Ya) about what a starving artist would do for money, especially as his lover falls victim to an accident and he needs big bucks to pay for the surgery.  The story does add in part to the desperation of the main character, but it is just not a compelling part of the story.

I did find the middle of the movie quite intriguing.  I found the Russian Roulette tournament quite interesting.  It was a good mix of decent acting, a fairly interesting storyline, decent use of flashbacks to let us know a little about many of the main characters, and good old fashion blood and violence.  This portion of the movie did have its drawbacks.  I do not bet on sporting events (or Russian Roulette tournaments for that matter).  While it showed the interactions of the people betting on the players and the managers of the players, I had no idea of what they were really talking about.  I got the sense that they were betting on winners and losers and it seemed that they were ""trading"" players somehow, but even after watching the movie three times, I still did not get a sense of what was going on behind the scenes in the betting rooms and the deals between managers.  Also, there is little character development in this portion of the move (or most of the movie in general).  Most of the main characters are referred to by numbers.  After watching the movie several times, I knew some of the main characters, most of them I knew by number only.

The ending of the movie was a typical chase the good guy down and steal his money plot, except it went a lot slower with much less excitement.  It was about as exciting as watching a car chase involving golf carts.  Personally, I think they could of just ended the film after the tournament completed and I think it would have been a better movie.

Overall, this is far from a standout movie.  The cast is great and there are moments of great acting.  I thought Michael Shannon as the ""arena master"" was a great bit of acting, even though the character was pretty insignificant.  50 Cent also had a small, insignificant part which I thought he did a good job with, given the lack of depth of the character.  Sam Riley did have a few good moments in the movie, but for the most part I felt his acting made the character unbelievable and overall I thought it was a poor performance.  I thought Jason Statham was the standout character of the movie with Mickey Rourke being second.  Despite a few good moments of acting in the movie, those moments with the story line just did not meld together at all to make a good flick.

This is one of those movies I would recommend you rent unless you can get it for a few bucks.  I think this could have been a good movie, but the pieces just did not fit together that well.  After everything was said and done, you are left with a finish product that just was not appealing.  I am giving the movie 2 stars as I thought one third of the movie was worthy of 4 stars and the other two-thirds were worthy of 1 star, thus averaging it out it was a two star movie.  I would not go as far as to call it a waste of time, but if a friend borrowed my copy and never brought it back, I would not even bother asking them to return it.",1337731200,,4514,4.259694477085781

4710292,2,B005IUIXCE,"Give me a dark, suspenseful thriller any day of the week. Fill it with an interesting cast (Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, 50 Cent, Ray Winstone, Sam Riley, Alexander Skarsgrd) and it's even better, right?

In this case, the formula falls flat.

Vince is a down-on-his luck electrician trying to do right by his family when he stumbles upon a potential get-rich-quick scheme. With a father in the hospital awaiting very pricey medical procedures and a family on the verge of homelessness, Vince takes the plunge into...what? He has no idea what he's walking into, and the scheme turns out to be much more dangerous than he ever anticipated. Shrouded in secrecy and set up for the amusement of bored, wealthy men, a deadly competition pits desperate man against desperate man. Vince quickly moves from a young man with noble intentions for his family to a frantic man trying to keep his life.

I'm fascinated by the premise of this story. It is so stunning and chilling in its simplicity. I'm also a big, big fan of Jason Statham and have to admit that his name alone compelled me to grab this DVD before even reading the synopsis. Unfortunately, the execution (no pun intended) of this plot leaves a lot to be desired. I am willing to sit through nearly any movie and see it through to the end because I'm always convinced that once I quit a movie, *that's* when it will get good. That's not the case here. I was so bored within the first 25 minutes that I really wanted to give up on watching this one. The dialogue is weak, the characters are one-dimensional, and this fantastic cast is wasted. Rourke is reduced to a caricature. And, by the way, where's the suspense in this suspense thriller?

When I first came across this title, I was amazed that I hadn't heard of the movie. A Jason Statham flick that escaped my attention? How could this be? After watching it, I wish I had remained in the dark as to its existence. I will, however, check out the original version. The Swedes have been putting out some stunning films, and I'm willing to bet that the original version will erase the dull image of this flat remake.",1329609600,,2121,4.588390501319261
4710293,2,B005IUIXCE,"13 is not what you might be expecting.  Jason Statham's presence would indicate a fast-paced action thriller like CRANK but 13 is neither fast paced nor action-packed.  It's a dark rather gloomy psychodrama focusing on a gentlemen's club who stage Russian roulette competitions to make millions of dollars by betting on the outcome.  A chance eavesdropping brings young Sam Riley into the fray.  Riley's father needs costly surgery and he sees the contest as a way to get the money.  Riley then becomes the movie's hero as his killings are justified in a Robin Hood sort of way.  Statham plays a small-time hood who enters his mentally ill brother (Ray Winstone) in the contest and Mickey Rourke is an imprisoned con offered a chance of freedom.  Rounding out the cast is 50 Cent, Alexander Skaarsgard and Ben Gazzara as promoters and Michael Shannon as the strangest emcee since CABARET's Joel Grey.
The main problem with 13 is its slow pacing, and the lack of a moral focus.  Its ending is also a real downer.

For a professionally-made movie, everything about it came off as amateurish.

No real character development to speak of, which is the real tragedy of this movie. It has a stellar cast, all of whom deserved better than the weak storytelling. I never saw the original, but '13' never had me invested in any of the characters. And not even really in the protagonist, whose actions at times really defy logic.

4710296,3,B005IUIXCE,"""13"" is based on a 2005 French thriller ""13 Tzameti"" by a Georgian director Gla Babluani, and it is not just a remake. Like Ole Bornedal's ""Nightwatch"" (based on ""Nattevagten"") and George Sluizer's ""The Vanishing"" (based on ""Spoorloos""), it is a remake by the same director of the original. And like these two unnecessary remakes, ""13"" only makes me ask myself: ""Do we need it?"" (Yes, I know, Hitchcock did ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" twice, but we all know that an exception makes the rule.)

The story is largely the same as the original. Sam Riley (""Control"") is Vince, a young electrician living in Ohio, whose father has been in hospital. Vince really needs money when he overhears a strange conversation about what he thinks could be a great chance to make a lot of money quickly.

If you have seen the trailer, you know what awaits Vince in a remote mansion in the woods. The idea of ""the most dangerous game"" is intriguing and the game sequences are intense, but as there is almost nothing the contestants can do to make the chance of ""winning"" bigger, the tension slowly drains out of it. Though Jason Statham's character refers to ""experiences,"" we know it's all about chance. No thinking, no outwitting others. And chance alone is not enough to keep us interested in the proceedings.

The cast also includes Ben Gazzara, Curtis Jackson, Mickey Rourke, Michael Shannon (over-the-top as a game's referee) and Ray Winstone. The characters of Jackson and Rourke are created for the remake. The acting is certainly solid, but with familiar faces and the photography that has become crispy (the original was shot in grainy black-and-white), something is missing from the new version.

Most of the traits that rendered the original film unique and fascinating are gone, and ""13"" looks more like an average thriller with one intriguing aspect: the game. Not a bad thriller at all, but I couldn't see the point of remaking.",1328832000,2,1925,4.824242424242424

4710298,3,B005IUIXCE,"I enjoy horror/action/suspense type movies, so when the opportunity came to get this film I dove in.  The movie stars Sam Riley.  He is an electrician who has a family who is in debt.  At a work site, he overhears a conversation concerning a illegal ""job"" that can pay huge.  The person involved in the conversation who is going to take this ""job"" ends up dying of a drug overdose, so Riley decides to show up in his place to do the ""job.""  The clandestine ""job"" turns out to be a russian roulette game.  There is only one winner out of thirteen, so he decides to hold it out-he can't back out anyway-to see if he can get his family out of debt.

The setting in the midwest effects the film in a negative way.  This is a remake of a film set in Paris entitled "" 13 Tzameti"".  Why not set this movie in New York, or Los Angeles California-I think that would have been more realistic.

This film was intense, but I was not as scared during the screnes of roulette playing as I thought I should be.  This was probably due to a lack of character developement.  This movie has a huge cast-Ray Winstone, ""50 Cent"" Curtis Jackson, Mickey Rourke, Jason Statham,Alexander Skarsgard, etc.-but they are not given a whole lot to do.  We only know the motivation of Sam Riley to play roulette, not the others.  Unfortunately, I also did not really like any of the characters either-they all seemed creepy and looked menacing most of the time.  Yes, I realize this is a thriller, however, character developement and good acting always help the plot along.  That is absent in this move.

Fans of Mickey Rourke will want to check out his role as a man forced to participate in this disturbing game.

This quick description promises what could be a Great Guy Movie.

Unfortunately, the movie we're talking about is ""13,"" and it's pretty bad.

For one thing, the movie has no idea whose story it's telling. For a movie with the aforementioned cast, you'd expect any one of them to make a compelling protagonist.  But the movie instead revolves around a young down-on-his-luck electrician named Vince (Sam Riley).  Odd jobs aren't enough for him to help his struggling family, and through a mix of coincidences and bad choices Vince finds himself a ""player"" in a demented game of Russian Roulette where various wealthy men wager millions on who will survive.

The tournament is simplicity itself.  Each player gets a revolver and, in the first round, a single bullet is spun into a random chamber.  They stand in circle, each aiming at the fellow in front of them.  A light bulb goes off, and everyone shoots.  Survivors make the next round.  In the second round, two bullets are loaded, and so forth.  These scenes are surprisingly devoid of suspense or charm - due in no small part that we really don't care a whit about Vince, who's a pretty unsympathetic guy.

""13"" has no idea what to do with its macho cast.  Alexander Skarsgard does little more than look concerned.  Mickey Rourke has a poorly-explained back story and does little more than grumble and flex.  Jason Statham has some good moments as the guy who's making millions entering his mentally-challenged brother (Ray Winstone) in these tournaments, but these two gifted actors are wasted as well.

The story simply meanders.  One major character makes it through and is told, ""you can go.""  Apparently he does, because we never see him again.  In another scene, a man attempts to garrote a player when another man walks in.  ""Stop that!"" he barks, and the assassination attempt ceases, but apparently with no hard feelings because nothing comes of it.  Most characters have no back story, no motivation, no compelling reason to be in this life-or-death tourney . . . they are simply there because the half-baked screenplay requires them to be.

Hollywood has a long if not proud history of milking the ""tournament of death"" sub-genre of action movies.  Some of these can be quite good - such as ""The Quick and the Dead,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc.  These movies give their characters just enough back story to justify their role in such an insane contest and they have more than a ibt of sly fun with the whole thing.  They can be great guilty pleasures.  ""13"" is neither great nor a pleasure, but it makes you feel a bit guilty for having watched it.",1325894400,2,2870,4.8040816326530615

Two of these men--played by Sam Riley and Mickey Rourke--have no idea what they're getting into while the third (Ray Winstone) is a favored champion in the competition.  Although the principal players exhibit solid acting, some of the supporting cast members (Michael Shannon) do not.

Ferro overhears Harrison talking to another guy about the envelope as a means to get some money.  Harrison dies in the house of a drug overdose while Vince is still there.

The police and paramedics take the man away and before Vince leaves he goes back for the man's envelope.  The envelope has instructions to go to the UPS Office to pick up a package.

There is no way out of the deal and the rounds are increasingly challenging and there can be only one winner. The movie is very well filmed, some characters are played by excellent known actors, like Mickey Rourke, Curtis Jackson, Jason Statham and Ray Winstone.
I recommend this movie to those who love to watch a movie on the edge of their seats. Although it is slow in action, the psychological thriller is intense and worth watching.
The movie is directed by Gela Babluani, it was released in DVD in September 2011 and Amazon.com was kind enough to provide this copy for me through their Vine Program for reviewing and I was not request to provide a positive review. Opinions expressed here are my own.",1324252800,,1348,4.574380165289257
4710312,2,B005IUIXCE,"The plot of '13' is sound... round up a bunch of nobodies (played by a great cast of heavyweights) and place them in the competitive, high-stakes world of Russian roulette.  Sounds pretty awesome... what could go wrong?  Against all odds, '13' is a dull, overacted, unlikable film.

Right from the start, the film wants you to feel sympathy for '13' (played by Sam Riley, who killed it as Ian Curtis in 'Control' just a few years ago), his dad is sick, the family is falling apart and is going to lose their home, but '13' never becomes a likable character.  Even his family isn't particularly endearing.  Along the way you meet the supporting characters behind each of the competitors, and none of them give the viewer any real reason to root for them.  Michael Shannon is usually a lot of fun on screen, but even as the ringmaster of the competition in '13', his overacting just leaves the audience grossed out by his loud, brassy, constant shouting... Felt like something from a high school play.

'13' is an American-ized remake of the French film '13 Tzameti'.  I never saw the original, but both films share the same writer and director, Gla Babluani.  I have to wonder if the original film was a project from the heart, with handpicked actors telling a story that Babluani envisioned, while the American version was stocked with American action actors in order to draw a young male audience, and something was lost in translation.

I love a good, gritty, terse thriller, but '13' seriously dropped the ball.",1323907200,,1514,4.744274809160306
4710313,2,B005IUIXCE,"This movie is was okay. From what I thought, the movie was gonna strictly be action, people blowing each other's heads off...and good stuff like that. First of all, it took like 40 minutes before the first trigger was even pulled. Talk about playing the waiting game. I mean, it's one thing if I have to wait for the story to get set up and this and that, but this was ridiculous. Here I am, waiting...and waiting, for nothing. The plot is completely unlikely, and they took forever getting to the good stuff.

Another thing that I was pretty excited about was both Jason Statham and 50 Cent both playing in the same movie. But, seriously, 50 Cent plays a really small part...a part barely even worthy of being on the cover. And Jason Statham...well, I guess I can just leave it at the fact that even his lamest movie was better than this. Such a let down for such great name drops.

In the end, I say this movie took forever to get into, and once you were into it...it only had your attention for 15 minutes! Then it went back into the same old lame back story. Take my advice, don't buy this movie. You'll be greatly disappointed if you do.",1323820800,2,1142,4.356807511737089
4710314,4,B005IUIXCE,"I understand that 13 is a remake of the 2005 film 13 Tzameti which seems to have a cult following.  Having never seen the original my review is based on a stand-alone viewing.  I found it Film Noir at its best - too bad it was not filmed in Black and White.  The bulk of the movie had all of the characters, from the cops to the contestants, from the high stakes betters to the money counters mostly dressed in black and white.  It surely set the mood for the dire consequences of this movie.

The basic premise is that desperate contestants who will do anything for money are invited to a game of Russian Roulette played at night in an ominous mansion where they've been routed by complex directions.  The last man standing is in for a lucrative payday; in this case Vince, played by Sam Riley, can pay for his father's much needed operation.  The film is filled with talented stars, among them: Ray Winstone, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham.  Each carries his roll well.  There are lots of odd camera angles which actually add to the plot.

Only a few of the players had any biographical background disclosed.  I'd have wanted to know more about who they were and why they were there so that when the gun aimed at their head went ""boom"" instead of  ""click"" I'd have more invested in them.  Overall I liked the movie quite a bit but I think I'll be renting 13 Tzameti to have a comparison.",1323648000,,1416,4.4
4710315,4,B005IUIXCE,"The film 13 is a type of Russian roulette for American audiences. There's a decent amount of star power and established actors collected for this, at times, drama, and those new to the premise might find themselves drawn into this foul underworld saga.

An electrician watching his family slide into crippling debt, Vince (Sam Riley) finds his curiosity elevated when he spies a client dealing with secretive materials in his house, talking about large paydays for taking part in a ""game."" When the homeowner dies, Vince steals the information, taking the man's place in the enigmatic scheme, following strict instructions that bring him into the lower levels of a remote mansion. Branded ""13,"" Vince finds himself caught up in a secret society that permits the wealthy and connected to bet on the lives of strangers, using brutal matches of Russian roulette that pit these 13 men against one another, some by choice (Ray Winstone), others by force (Mickey Rourke). With the moneymen (including Jason Statham and Ben Gazzara) calling the shots, Vince learns there is no escape, coerced into playing until the last man stands.

To the director's credit he doesn't inflate the material to blockbuster standards, keeping ""13"" low to the ground in terms of execution. It's a hard-edged premise that doesn't need over-the-top razzle-dazzle to connect with the viewer, best communicated through panicked close-ups and icy stares, using the dire ambiance of the game room to fuel the suspense. The film actually does a commendable job finding a macabre rhythm, utilizing the mysteries of the opening act to shape Vince's curiosity and desperation, finding the clueless young man committing to a threatening offer and its numerous security checkpoints without knowledge of what's to come. The director regrettably attempts to jumpstart the nightmare with a pointless flash-forward before the film begins (revealing Vince's ultimate level of competition), but the creep of the situation remains strong in the early going, producing interest in seeing what happens next.

The gaming sequences form the core of the picture, taking viewers to the brink of madness as the players are arranged in a circular formation, each with a loaded gun pointed at the brain stem of the man in front of them. It's a startling scenario, milked well by the cast, including Michael Shannon as the master of ceremonies, perched high on a ladder, barking orders to the players as though possessed by the Devil himself. The violence is minimal, yet the build-up to the trigger pulls is unrelenting, isolating the fear factor of assured doom, with Vince, the newcomer to the game, unsure of his willingness to participate. Though familiar in design, the Russian roulette events retain their primitive sense of horror, establishing substantial tension for the midsection of the movie.

""13"" is an icy film, and it seems like the director felt the need to inject some emotional texture into the piece, making Vince a whimpering victim of the lousy economy, while gambler Jasper (Statham) prods his mentally ill brother (Winstone) into defending his title, creating an irritable family dynamic. Characters never blossom, but performances by Riley and Winstone carry a passable weight, while the supporting cast is permitted brief blasts of personality. Color by Rourke and Gazzara is welcome, but there's also Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in the mix, playing a member of the onlookers, furthering his reputation as one of the worst actors in the business today. Thankfully, his screen time is limited.

Given the quiet way it came and went from theaters it isn't surprising that the DVD has nothing to offer in the way of features, other than looking good through a HDTV.

The bleak space of Russian roulette is exactly where ""13"" should remain, yet the film feels the need to extend beyond the game to sniff out more of a conventional resolution. Its material best suited for blunt shocks, not tired thriller elements, stumbling to find a sickening closing irony in a story that lacks the final one-two punch to bring it home. It's not quite the as disastrous as it could've been so overall the experience is enjoyable.",1323388800,,4180,5.103801169590644
4710316,3,B005IUIXCE,"""13"" is the first movie, I can recall, since ""The Deer Hunter"" that uses Russian roulette as a plot device.  I would go out on a limb and say that ""13"" utilizes Russian roulette even more than ""The Deer Hunter"" did.  Therefore, I found this movie to have a very unique and different vibe about it.  I found it to be very intense and extremely well acted.  Unfortunately, certain aspects of this film keep it hostage from being an amazing motion picture.

The plot is somewhat basic; Vince (Sam Riley) and his family have hit hard times with money.  His father is in the hospital for a reason that is never disclosed (a textbook MacGuffin) and needs various operations to get him back on his feet.  Since the family has exhausted all their options, Vince ends up taking extreme measures to aid his family.  Using the ruse of paraphrasing, Vince blindly uses someone else's identity believing it will bring him some quick money.  However, Vince finds himself being player number ""13"" in an underground gambling circuit in a round robin style game of Russian roulette.

There a couple of subplots in this movie, one involving Mickey Rourke and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, another involving Ray Winstone and Jason Statham.  I found these subplots, well acted and very, very engaging. Alexander Skarsgrd known by most as Eric on the show ""True Blood"" gives a strong performance in a supporting role.  As I noted prior, the acting in this movie is excellent.  I knew Sam Riley played Ian Curtis in ""Control"". I haven't seen that movie yet, which is odd because I am fond of Joy Division. Nevertheless, Sam Riley played a good protagonist and I look forward to see him in other films.  As for Jason Statham, I have always had mixed feelings about him as an actor. In some movies I roll my eyes and at other I enjoy his work. I would have to say he gave a strong performance in this film.  In addition, he doesn't throw a single punch, which is different for him.  Rourke and Winstone were solid as always and even good old 50 Cent provided a good performance.

The problem I had with this film was the last half an hour.  The pace became a jumbled mess, appearing as too many things needed to be addressed before the 90 minute mark came.  For instance, there was an unneeded side story with the police attempting to find this underground circuit.  As for the final scene, without spoiling it, there was an excellent irony to the denouement. Yet I also felt like, ""I sat through 90 minutes for this"".

This movie is a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the original so I cannot make any comparisons.  Nor am I aware if this film has been honest to the source material.  I believe if the last half an hour could be reworked and subplots either expanded or eliminated, this could have been an amazing film.  I believe the film could even have the same ending, if the former and latter issues could be addressed.

In the end this film is interesting, different, and at times very intense and has really good acting.  I would recommend giving this movie a go, there are definitely worse movies a person could watch.  I for one am interested to see the original.",1323388800,,3152,4.542553191489362
4710317,2,B005IUIXCE,"This movie grabs your attention when you see the A-List cast that stars in this film, but the dark and twisted plot takes a \ away so much from the film. ""13"" tracks a young man(Sam Riley) who's family is in need of money and comes across as an opportunity to make a huge amount of money and help his family out of their financial woes.

The story gets interesting as the secretive job becomes known and this is where the story begins. The large money investors have to make bets on who will survive the Russian roulette style game by giving the winner of the game almost two million dollars. The sub-plot includes a Mickey Rourke storyline that includes 50 cent and the story loses me somewhat right there.

This movie has a great cast, great acting, but the dark and barbaric plot makes you lose most of your interest in the movie. I want to give it 3 stars for the three great actors but I have to take away a star for the dismal plot.",1323302400,,938,4.264044943820225

  ""13"" is a provocative, tension-packed film from writer/director, Gla Babluani; it is the remake of the European hit ""13 Tazameti.""  It has a great ensemble of male action stars.  The acting is superb, especially from young Sam Riley who gives a convincing performance as Vince who is emotionally distraught throughout the film.  He is distraught by his father's injuries, his family's financial ruin, his poor decisions in regards to quickly obtaining a large amount of cash, and his forced participation in a barbaric game where he must murder other men in order to survive.  This film kept me on the edge of my seat until the bitter, shocking end that made me feel nauseous.  The film has some gore; however more emphasis is placed on the emotional upheaval and the tragic toll on the human psyche.  The expressions on the faces of the participants after each round of shooting are incredibly diverse, gripping and unforgettable.

  Because of the economic downturn, many men who've lost their jobs have resorted to fighting in rings or cages where there are no rules.  The wealthy and privileged stand around, leering and cheering as they watch brutish men beat each other mercilessly.  ""13"" is a sad commentary on the depravity of man's greed for money.  With its shocking, disturbing ending, ""13"" is a film that will be difficult to dismiss.  It will make the viewer hope not to get into a situation where their desperation for money tempts them to risk their life.  Unfortunately, I was appalled by the lack of special features on Anchor Bay's DVD release.  There are no deleted scenes, commentary, making of featurettes, etc.  This is a shame.  If you are a big fan of this film, many of your questions are going to be left unanswered.  Fortunately, the video and audio presentation are excellent.  The film has a theatrical release aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and English and Spanish Subtitles.

Instead of going all John Q on the nearest HMO, he takes a chance and assumes the identity of the recently deceased owner, only to find out he's now an unwilling participant in an underground Russian Roulette game with wealthy bettors.

Mickey Rourke plays the role of one of the contestants; 50 Cent plays a bodyguard of some kind.  Ben Gazzara (looking somewhat skeletal) renews his filthy rich role from Roadhouse.  Jason Statham, Michael Shannon, and Emmanuelle Chriqui have bit parts that have no significant impact on the film.

A very slow start severely hinders the film, and the drama is subdued because every viewer knows who will lose the battle of the odds.  The lack of involvement for the major names is a sign of an incomplete concept.  I wanted to like this more than I did.",1323043200,,1317,4.787610619469026

The premise is the character played by Sam Riley is in dire need of money to cover family medical expenses and he wrangles himself into a high stakes game of russian roulette for the chance to win a lot of money.
Jason Stratham plays a wheeler dealer character, quite reminiscent of his performance on Lock Stock and two smoking barrels, who's brother is playing in this high stakes game.
As mentioned, although there are a lot of big named stars in the movie, the movie itself is actually quite low budget, fairly bad dialogue and questionable acting from some of the not so well known characters.

Co-writing this version with Gregory Pruss is the only aspect of this adaptation he shared.  The story is a tough one to watch, not unlike `Fight Club', but with higher stakes. It share how far gambling men will go to get their thrills, making cock fights seem very tame.  The game at hand is based on gathering quasi-desperate men (prisoners, men deeply in debt, criminals who have little to lose, etc), placing them in a room with tee shirts bearing numbers, giving them guns, placing them in a circle, and on the command of the master of ceremonies they are to fire their gun into the head of the person in front of them. A smarmy form of Russian roulette, at first each man's gun has one bullet in the chamber, but as the game goes on more bullets are placed and the game continues until there is one man left alive.  The gamblers place bets on the various numbered men and the stakes are high. This process is performed in a isolated meeting space and is closely scrutinized by detectives who seek to uncover the scheme and stop it.

Vince (Sam M. Riley of `Control' and `Brighton Rock') is a young electrician whose father has been in an accident resulting in sever injuries that require multiple surgeries.  Vince's family must put their house up for sale to pay the expenses unless Vince can find a quicker way to make big money to pay the hospital and surgeons.  Quite by accident while doing an electrical job he over hears the house owner discuss a `job' that promises to pay a lot of money.  The man plans on doing the job, receives an envelope with instructions, but then shoots up heroin and dies of an overdose.  Vince helps the police who investigate, but before leaving the house Vince takes the envelope that contains instructions and a cell phone and a piece of bark with the number 13 printed on it.  Vince follows the instructions and ends up in a complex scheme - the ultimate result of which is the fact that he becomes #13 in the gambling game.  Others sequestered for the killer game include Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, and among those involved in the offensive debacle are Alexander Skarsgard, Ben Gazzara, and emcee Michael Shannon.  The ending of the film is a complete surprise and revealing even part of it would ruin the impact of the film.

This is definitely not a film for the fainthearted.  That such a gruesome gambling scheme could exist is terrifying.  But the production and the acting and the grisly atmosphere is well worth the moviegoer's attention. Grady Harp,  November 11",1322092800,6,2678,4.608421052631579

It's the kind of movie that sparks discussion too. One of the better action films that we've seen lately.",1321920000,,647,4.338842975206612
4710332,3,B005IUIXCE,I think fiddy cent should stick to rapping and leave his sub par acting career alone. The rest of the actors did fine but the events could have been portrayed in a more exciting way. Just okay.,1321747200,,193,4.243243243243243
4710333,1,B005IUIXCE,"A slow, boring movie with a terrible ending.  It has some quality actors and an intriguing premise.  But the ending is a make you feel bad ending and at the end of the movie, I felt like I wasted my money.  I pay for movies to be entertaining, and this was not.  Just terrible.",1321056000,2,277,4.074074074074074

4710335,1,B005IUIXCE,"There must be two versions of this film,because this is not the same movie i've watched. They added this stupid music to the film that takes away from the coldness,raw,and tension of the movie that makes this film so awesome. Do not buy this version buy the international version of this movie with jason statham.",1320969600,,313,4.709090909090909

Taking the place of a player in a Russian Roulette game, Vincent becomes Player 13 of a 16 player and manages through sheer dumb luck to stay alive and survive the carnage.

There's not any underlying moral or anything like that.  It's violence for the sake of amusement.",1491696000,,353,4.484375
