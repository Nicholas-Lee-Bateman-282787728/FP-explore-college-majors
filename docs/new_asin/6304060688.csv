779950,5,6304060688,A sensous & alluring look into the macabre. Princess Miyu is captivating.,911433600,,73,5.166666666666667
7861668,2,6304060688,"Basically it's a boring anime that doesn't have a very interesting storyline. There is hardly any voices and its also kinda hard to follow. I think the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because its creepy and i like creepy stuff. If you dislike maniquines then you will be plenty scared. You will understand if you watch it. If you really want to see it, rent it first. Thats what I did and im glad that's all i did.",1015372800,,423,4.108433734939759
7861669,3,6304060688,"No attempt is made to develop motivations of
the characters. Hiromi has an intense, irrational
hatred of Miyu. Why? (Who cares...)",1003190400,,130,5.238095238095238
7861670,5,6304060688,"Yes. I do have to agree with most of the reviews, the story of Vampire Princess Miyu is a gothic story. A very good one in fact. I'm not going to tell the story of the tapes but I do suggest buying them. They are worth it. I really like ep. 2 and 3. ^_^ And Larva is really cool too! I can't wait for the TV series to come out.
Also, ignore the 1 star reviews. VPM is truly one of the best gothic vampire movies there are. And the artwork is beautiful too. Hope this review helps.",995760000,4,480,3.8585858585858586
7861671,5,6304060688,"I used to watch a lot of anime, but after a while the plots and characters all seemed the same. Sure, the artwork is beautiful, but how many times can you watch giant robots punch each other out? VPM is a rare of example of what anime can be: cinema which simply happens to be in animated form. There are demons to contend with, but the series is character-driven and never devolves into the kind of tedious, flashy violence which is all that the vast majority of anime has to offer. The stories are intelligent and moving, and instead of simplistic good guys and bad guys, the characters are morally ambiguous or self-conflicted. If you appreciate the dark beauty of tragedy, you will enjoy VPM. The version I own is subtitled, so I can't comment on the voice acting that others have criticized. But as for those who complain about the artwork, all I can say is you don't need Industrial Light and Magic computers to tell a story beautifully and clearly.",981504000,,955,4.558139534883721
7861672,4,6304060688,"Right now, I have to state this: THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! Those who live off of faced paced anime such as Akira, Ghost In The Shell, and others(insert title here) will most deffentatly not like this. Especially in that mindset.
Less in common than Vampire Hunter D(SUPRA NAST!) and more in common with Serial Experments Lain(slow and atmospheric), VPM relies on tickling the mind of the viewer rather than either grossing them out.
The series represents Miyu as a character with two main motives: banishing the demons that have locked her in ""suspended time"" and going after young prey that she so hungers for. However, she hits a snag when a young exorsist begins to figure out whether Miyu truly present threat to humanity. Little does she know, she has more in common with Miyu than she reallizes.
VPM presents the viewer with multiple questions with no answer. The big one is; is she a good guy or is she just as evil as the demons she hunts? Its this sort of thing that makes the viewer enjoy the series if he/she is willing to open up their minds.
The artwork, despite the negative reviews, I thought were really quite well drawn. Having not read the manga, however, I cannot draw compairsons. The color is bland, but the on the other side, that adds to the atmosphere, allowing for a darker feel rather than the happy-go-luck feel that is very common place in today's anime. Plus, Larva looks so freakin' cool!
The music is quality. It adds to the atmosphere without ever becoming cliche or techno.
The only real problem I have is the acting. Even for Japanese voice actors, some seem rather disinterested in their roll. However, this can be over looked because the main rolls are played well. Not the best voice acting, but certainly not the worst(look at DBZ dubbing, then call me in the morning.....).
If you want something that is action packed, stay way. This is not your anime. If you would rather have an anime that strokes your mind and makes your skin crawl(if the right ambiance is present), then this is great choice. Just heed my warnings...",973036800,5,2061,4.64931506849315
7861673,5,6304060688,"_Vampire Princess Miyu_ tells an intensely Japanese story of duty (Miyu's curse comes from her mother's attempt to save her child from her clan's duty) and the tragic transience of beauty (the Japanese concept of ``mono  no aware'' --- shown by both the characters who seek immortality, and those  who have achieved it while losing everything else).
Almost every  character in these films says something that you will think about for days  after.  The films bear repeated viewings.
Some may be frustrated by the  fact that these films consist almost entirely of character development and  atmosphere --- very little actually *happens*, the films have the stately,  otherworldly pace of a Noh drama.  But others will be bowled over by the  imagery and the poetry.",950486400,2,762,5.07258064516129
7861674,5,6304060688,"IMHO, Vampire Princess Miyu ranks up with Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and assorted selections from Miyazaki as amongst the finest anime produced.  The plot is sophisticated.  The fantasy is sound.  The motivations are  complex.  The hero does not always win.  For that matter, exactly who is  the hero of this piece?  There's moral commentary here, but the creators  don't draw the conclusions for you.  If you want stomping military action,  guns, and violence like mister One Star review here, then this isn't the  anime for you.  Sure, there are some clever sourcerous battles, but that's  not the emphasis here.  The complete series of Miyu is 4 mini-episodes,  each examining the reactions of 3 essentially static characters in  different situations.",949795200,,754,5.15
7861675,5,6304060688,"This is what I would call a classic. This anime Will stay popular For years to come. I'll tell you right now you will not stop watching this! The pictures are beautiful, the story line is great, and you'll absolutley fall in love with the young vampire princess, miyu, I know I did. This is a must  have if you're an anime lover. The only problem I had with it was the voice  of Miyu. It sounded very Girlish but beautiful at the same time. I suggest  rent Japanese videos at Anime store, You'll understand better if OAV is too  fast past.  Please get this it's great!",943833600,8,568,4.271028037383178
7861676,5,6304060688,"I really liked this series! It is really good but I wouldn't have understood it that well if I didn't know what it was about before hand. I have to admit, every good thing has a falt.... I got a bit annoyed with how  Miyu's voice sounded really young and girlish... but after a while I didn't  mind. Also I am sad in a way that the series is so short! It really ends  with leaving you hanging. But in a way, that is a good thing, for or else I  would go broke buying every video! ^_^ The plot is kinda sad and serious...  but I totally recomend this video for anyone! If you have any questions  about the movie you can E-mail me with Questions.",939772800,4,644,4.031496062992126
