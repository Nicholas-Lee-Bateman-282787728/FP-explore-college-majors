2439471,2,B000BS6YU6,"My children have enjoyed this DVD but I found it not to be a very good value - $19.99 for less than 25 mins. of video. Because I got it to expose my children to Spanish I was disappointed at the amount of songs in English vs. Spanish.  Also, not much speaking going on.",1136505600,9,269,3.9814814814814814
8091729,5,B000BS6YU6,"This DVD of Spanish and English nursery rhymes is an awesome DVD! My 7 month old daughter loves it and the DVD has an insert with the lyrics, great to sing along and to teach your little one another language.",1257292800,,208,4.225
8091730,1,B000BS6YU6,"This is poorly done.  Nursery rhymes are not done in both languages, it has some in English and some in Spanish, but none in both languages.",1210982400,,140,4.384615384615385
8091731,5,B000BS6YU6,"Fun, entertaining for kids and adults and educational. It would be nicer if all the song words could be understood and this is from someone who grew up listening to and speaking Spanish.",1202601600,,186,4.666666666666667
8091732,2,B000BS6YU6,"The songs are okay; however it looked rather cheesy. I bought it to use in my classroom, but somehow it's not interesting enough (to me). Some of the songs are nice, but its really just a translated version of many english songs. Also, the fact that there weren't any Hispanic children on the DVD rather disturbed me.",1190246400,5,317,4.578947368421052
8091733,5,B000BS6YU6,"We have been looking for a spanish-language video for my grandchildren to watch, and we just found this DVD & the other Cantarima DVDs.  We love all of them. The children love the puppets, the music and the colors.  I really like the fact that the songs are real Spanish children's songs, the ones that I knew growing up, so that my grandchildren are learning both Spanish and true Spanish songs as well.  Plus the bilingual DVDs teach English songs, which my grandchildren know from preschool, so they really love to sing along, and then they are learning to sing along in Spanish too!  Highly recommend these DVDs.",1188950400,2,616,4.675925925925926
8091734,5,B000BS6YU6,"My 11-month-old has been happily watching this for months.  The puppets are adorable and there is plenty of variety both visually and in the soundtrack.  Our baby likes to watch the toddlers and preschoolers, but the puppets are her favorite.  My husband is a Spanish-speaker but as I am at home with her all day and speak mainly English, it's great for her to have more exposure to basic conversational Spanish.  I have also been able to pick up some traditional Spanish nursery rhymes/songs (comes with a songsheet so you can learn the words).",1184544000,,545,4.76595744680851
8091735,2,B000BS6YU6,"I recently got this DVD as a present...  I have to say it is not as nice as I expected to be.  Compared to other DVDs in Spanish we own (the A la Vbora de la Mar series) this one seems to be of a much lower quality.  Also, the songs and the music are not as nice, and there is too much English involved.  My other complaint is that although it states that it uses traditional Hispanic nursery Rhymes, some of the songs are not-so great-translations of English nursery rhymes...

If you want every video out there to introduce your baby to Spanish, buy this one too.  But if you have to choose, I would definetly go for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Colores-de-Rufino/dp/B000HCPSC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Colores de Rufino</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/123-Cuentame-un-Cuento/dp/B000HCPSBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">123 Cuentame un Cuento</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Do-Re-Mi-Nino/dp/B000HCPSBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Do Re Mi Nino</a>.",1177027200,4,1096,6.905797101449275

8091737,5,B000BS6YU6,"I bought 3 dvds, Teatro de la Floresta #1, the Praise baby collection, and this one.  I wanted my baby not only be expose to the music but to the visuals.  The first 2 in my opinion are boring, especially the second one, Cantos y rimas is fun upbeat and keeps baby's interest.  Though some of us would have prefer the dvd to be longer, it is aim to babys and toddlers so it is only 24 min long.  The songs are even really easy to learn.

If what you want is to expose your child to the Spanish language whether or not you are a native, I belive that it is a great tool because even though it is not 100% Spanish the English languages is secundary.",1154390400,3,647,4.0234375
8091738,5,B000BS6YU6,My kids LOVE this video (ages 4 & 5)!  They watch it over & over again and are definitely learning Spanish words from it.  They think the puppets are the funniest things on earth.  And they are SO proud to tell me the words they know in Spanish.  They sing along to the songs every time.  I would highly recommend it to other parents who want to expose their young kids to the Spanish language!,1139184000,5,394,4.2
