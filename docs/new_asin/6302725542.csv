507241,4,6302725542,"A sparkling 50's comedy by Cukor. Filled with memorable performances  mainly Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford, William Holden does whatever  he can with his limited character. Judy Holliday gives a priceless  performance as the prototypical dumb blonde who turns out not to be that  dumb. Broderick Crawford gives a powerful performance, but sometimes he  goes a bit too far and we get scared instead of laughing. But Holliday's  performance is the one that keeps the movie at a steady pace, nobody can  deliver such funny lines in such opportune moments as she can. Filled with  many memorable one-liners and the gin-sequence is a keeper. A very funny  film that still sparkles after all these years. From a scale of 1-10 I give  this film an 8!",962582400,4,750,4.880952380952381
507242,4,6302725542,"Dont waste your time with the remake with Melanie Griffith...its absurdly terrible.
Just a few lines delivered by the great Judy Holday lets the viewer know what a deft and fragile comedy this film really is.
Broderick  Crawford is at his best and Holden plays the straight man. Considering what  trash is made in hollywood today..this film evokes a time where writing,  direction and acting all played a part in making timless comedy on film  .Will we ever see that again. Sorry!",960422400,,480,4.817073170731708
507243,5,6302725542,"This is a fine movie, marvelously crafted, well written, superbly acted, and luciously photographed. The DVD medium shows off the wonderful black and white cinematography more than any of its predecessors.
Shining over  all else in this film is the tour de force of Billie Holliday playing a  ""dumb blonde"" who -- surprise -- is anything but dumb. William  Holden and Broderick Crawford are perfect foils for her brilliance, good  guy and bad guy. The most wonderful aspect of this movie is the  demonstration of Billie Holliday's character coming into its own,  developing poise, awareness, and intellect. Her sensitivity and mastery as  an actress are nowhere more visible than in this film.
The plot is  diverting--a rough and greedy hoodlum seeking to dominate everyone else,  hoodwinked by his own pretensions of grandeur, surrounded by a wond'rous  variety of people.",954288000,,873,5.215827338129497

Unfortunately for the junk dealer, who demands his girlfriend become more educated, the girlfriend falls in love with the person he enlists (William Holden) to smarten her up.

507408,5,6302725542,"The acting genius of Judy Holiday, William Holden and Broderick Crawford in this comedy-drama is superb. Nothing's changed in the DC political swamp- to date. This film is set in the 1950's;A blow hard, low-life (Broderick Crawford) who made his millions in JUNK arrives in DC to ""buy"" a Congressman -already lined -up with his hand out, and takes along his mistress, he recused from a chorus-line (Judy Holiday) with him. He feels she's not classy or educated enough to interact with politicians and their wives. He engages a newspaper reporter of distinction (William Holden) to create another 'Pygmalion' miracle. Holden gives her books to read, and as they traverse the capital, congress, she read the original document of our forefathers,he schools her on the greatness of our founding fathers, presidents, and what makes America special and why honest politics and politicians are important. Holden and Holiday's characters turn the table on Crawford's character- I'll say just this much more...you'll love this film if you're into the classics.

507465,5,6302725542,What a wonderful movie. 1950 was a terrific year for movies and this was one of the ones I'd never seen (despite loving Sunset Blvd. and All About Eve). I'm glad I finally saw it. What a treat. Judy Holliday is hilariously funny and very  moving.,1485820800,,246,4.3478260869565215
507466,3,6302725542,"Judy Holliday is famous for this role, and she is special. And the movie is funny, entertaining, and momentarily shocking. But in the many years since 1950, actors and directors have evolved the production, sometimes in positive ways. (I would exclude the 1993 film with Melanie Griffith from any positive comments. What should be a great cast turns a funny play/movie into a largely boring, rarely funny, drama. Let's blame the director!)

I recently saw this show on stage, and the direction was superior. The pacing was far better. The male lead was a more believable bad guy, and the female lead was absolutely hysterical. All that together made for wonderful chemistry, great laughs, as well as some shocking and emotional moments. Can't take the live production home, of course, so watching Judy, Broderick and William do their thing is still fun.",1485734400,,853,5.007042253521127

Broderick Crawford is her brutish, yet somehow, vulnerable, boyfriend.  It takes place in Washington DC with a political story line that could come right out of today's headlines.  Holden and Holliday have wonderful chemistry together and behind the comedy, you see the raw truth of people coming to grips with the truth of what their lives are and should be.",1485475200,2,509,5.170731707317073

507513,3,6302725542,"Broderick Crawford talks a mile-a-minute in this sentimental comedy, and Judy Holliday talks even more quickly and in a higher key and with a more raspy sound -- maybe like Edith Bunker on nitrous oxide -- and William Holden talks like a normal human being, just so we get the point, and at the end of it all, Holliday walked away with an Oscar!  Well -- it's a tour-de-force, and it has its charm, but it's a bit dated all the same.  The basic situation is that Crawford is a rich, crooked businessman who has come down to Washington to keep the squeeze on a congressman who is in his pay, and though he's unrefined himself, his vanity requires that his girlfriend (Holliday) show more class and ""savoir-faire.""  He hires an under-employed journalist (Holden) to be a kind of Henry Higgins to his diamond-in-the-rough.  To the film's credit, Holden can't do much about the accent, but he does take Holliday to all the Washington sights -- Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol, Library of Congress, etc., with the effect that Holliday's eyes are opened to her boyfriend's crassness, but more than that, his corruption.  Thereafter, the end is predictable.  Still, the pacing is fine, the farcical moments in the plot are well-established, and it's all enjoyable.

507575,4,6302725542,"Some films come at you quietly, some like the film under review, the film adaptation of Garson Kanins Broadway play, Born Yesterday, come screaming at you, literally, and from the first scene. So once you get that idea under your belt you are able to sit back and watch some serious professional actors go about their business of making a play come alive on the screen (these adaptations don't always have such a happy results). Watch too, maybe squinting a lot, what would today be a politically incorrect take, a very politically incorrect take, on the relationship between a power-crazed man and a salt of the earth woman. And watch too the play of forces in a power struggle, a not very far from todays Washington political reality slice of life from the 1950s.

Heres how this beauty, directed by the talented romantic comedy director from that period George Cukor, played out. Big-mouthed (like I say from the get-go) Harry, a no nonsense, by the school of hard knocks, never give a sucker an even break book gangster big time junk magnate from Jersey, played by Broderick Crawford, last seen in this space playing a loud-mouthed Huey Long-type politician in the successful film adaptation of Robert Penn Warrens All The Kings Men, and his honey, an ex-showgirl, also loud, Billie, and supposedly dumb to boot, played to Oscar-winning perfection by Judy Holliday, encamp in Washington in order to buy a congressman in order to further Harrys business interests. Fair enough, done all the time as we know now from the infinitely resourceful lobbyists who clutter up K and 14th Streets, but Harry has, as the Harrys of the world usually do, a problem with hanging around Washington with what he comes to consider, with a little help from his lawyer, a dumb cluck of a dame even if he does love her in his own caveman way (with a couple of slaps thrown in when she gets out of line-see what I mean about the politically, legally too, incorrect stuff in this one). So Harry, taking a unconscious leaf from Pygmalion, hired a journalist, Paul, played by William Holden, last seen in this space face down in Norma Desmonds swimming pool up in the high numbers on Sunset in Sunset Boulevard to un-dumb her (dont worry this is a romantic comedy so Holden will not face the gauntlet this time).

Earnest Paul takes his student Billie in charge and gives her some book-learning, some basic civics lessons circa the 1950s when we were all a little more nave about the real processes of government, and a well-travelled tour of the various historical sights which dot and define the Washington landscape. And Billie, in the end, learns her lessons well, too well for power-hungry Harry. She does her part to foul up Harrys best laid plans, aided by the idealistic Paul. Harry, well Harry finds out that even with a ton of dough Washington is a tough town to break into, to keep the power-brokers bought. Top the whole thing off with a little romance between teacher and student (improbable to me since Ms. Holliday did not seem to be Mr. Holdens type off his previous and subsequent cinematic track record but we will let that pass) and you have a very fine 1950s production with some great, if loud, dialogue, especially Ms. Hollidays come-backs at Harry when he is in one of his rages.",1453593600,,3281,4.714285714285714

507653,5,6302725542,"This is a great comedy starring Judy Holiday.  So great, in fact Judy Holiday won the Oscar for her performance. The entire cast is perfect  and each character plays perfectly off of each other. Judy Holiday plays Billie Dawn, who is portrayed as a a really ditzy blonde bombshell.  Broderick Crawford plays her loud mouthed, husband, who literally pushes his weight around and wants his wife to appear intelligent and classy for a number of bigwigs he is trying to impress. The arguments between the two are brilliantly funny. ( The gin rummy scene is comedy at its best) Crawford never realizes how foolish and stupid HE sounds compared to everyone around him. Watching Holidays mannerisms, listening to her voice and sarcastic comebacks is amazing acting and not to be missed. William Holden is hired by Crawford to give Holiday a mental""makeover"" in order to impress a group of bigwigs from Washington. He doesn't want his ""dumb"" wife to botch things up for all the big plans he has all his money and reputation (such as it is) riding on. The chemistry between Holden and Holiday is something to see.  As always Bill Holden gives a great performance and lets Holiday shine.  The screenplay is a work of art and in my humble opinion, you can not find movies made like this today.  The dialogue is fast and furious and it is hard to imagine how much REAL work went into making a movie of this caliber.  I've watched this movie three times in my life now and it just keeps getting better. This is not a goofy, stupid, funny movie. Born Yesterday is all class and true comedic bliss.

507657,3,6302725542,"Born Yesterday, 1950 film

It opens with a view of Washington DC. People arrive at a hotel. Harry Brock wants an entire floor at the hotel. A reporter wants to talk to him. [We see Harrys character.] Is he a mug and a roughneck? He was working since his teens. He picked up junk for resale (and learned a racket). What is he doing in Washington? He tells Billie how to dress and act. So too his lawyers. Billie used to be a chorus girl. Congressman Hedges and his wife visit, they converse. [Note the personalities.] Harry wants Billie to get educated to better fit into Washington society. Harry hires a reporter - at $200 a week. [The dollar figures are far out of date; thats overpaying, not good business.] A card game shows the character of Harry and Billie. Billie doesnt read newspapers - except the comics. She kisses the reporter - his politeness?

The next morning Billie is reading when Paul arrives. Later they go sightseeing: the Capitol, the Library of Congress. Billie reads the Second Amendment. [Would this be allowed in a movie today?] The story goes on with conversations that are comic and dramatic. Harry takes his shoes off at home. [A personal quirk?] Whats a peninsula? Thats that new medicine. Harry is dictatorial. The maid likes happy stories. [For an unhappy life?] Harry has a temper! Billie is asked to sign a paper; is it a cartel? There is conflict, Harry slaps Billie to get her to sign those papers. Harry isn't a fascist, he was born in Plainfield NJ! Should Harry marry Billie for security? What if she doesnt agree? Billie isn't scared of Harry anymore. Harry argues with his lawyer. Harry threatens Paul. So Paul and Billie leave. Will they get a marriage license?

You wonder if Harrys schemes will work out now? Could some owner-operated small business really have the money to compete in Washington D, then or now? Isnt this more of a fantasy than an expos? Could a movie reveal what actually goes on in Washington (or your state capital)? Wouldnt Big Corporations stamp out small businesses like Harrys? The 1956 movie The Girl Cant Help It is a parody and musical comedy of this play. All the Presidents Men shows what went on if the White House. This movie implies that Congress was more important (then).",1418515200,,2249,4.659949622166247

507691,4,6302725542,"I would love to say it had been years since I saw this movie but in reality I never had the chance. Perhaps I missed it on the late late show years ago (back when there was a late late show) or when it was first released on DVD. For whatever reason I missed it. The good news is that the world of DVD and blu-ray is giving those of us who are movie lovers a chance to go back and find all the great movies that we missed years ago. Thank goodness companies like Twilight Time exist.

For the rest of you who missed this film it tells the story of a millionaire who made his way to the top by bullying any and all around him. Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) is a self made man who takes control and uses his money to influence anything that stands in his way of making more money. On a trip to use his influence and cash on politicians he takes along his live in love Billie Dawn (Judy Holliday). Unfortunately Billie has less ability to move along with the hoi paloi than Harry does and her inability to mingle shows. So Harry hires a snooping reporter named Paul Verrall (William Holden) to teach Billie some finesse.

Verall enjoys the task at hand, helping Billie to read more and learn more about the world around her, one she never took much interest in before. But the more she reads and learns the less she likes the lifestyle she's living as well as the brute who is her benefactor. Along the way Billie and Verall begin to find an attraction to one another that working so close together brings. This triangle is even more problematic with the fact that while he treats her like a plaything Harry truly does love Billie.

While this all sounds serious the movie actually plays for laughs from start to finish. The education of Billie by Verall lends itself to some tremendous laughs as this empty headed blonde becomes an educated heroine. To watch as she seeks out knowledge, running to the dictionary to find the right word she's looking for or seeing the original documents that formed this country in awe make her someone you can root for. It's these moments that shine and make this movie all the more memorable.

Judy Holliday may be a forgotten face from Hollywood these days but as long as her films are brought to life via DVD another generation has the opportunity to discover her and the comedic sensibilities that she displayed in countless films. Perhaps the only drawback in this film is the Betty Boop styled squeaky voice she uses, perfect for the character but difficult to understand at times. Thank goodness for subtitles. Yes, I honestly had to use them here on and English speaking film!

The movie comes through fine in this blu-ray edition and it's so nice that someone like Twilight Time has kept it alive. As with most of their movies though if you want to own this one get it now. They limit the quantities of their blu-rays to only 3,000 and once they're gone, they're gone. If you're a fan of screwball comedy, of political comedy or of classic cinema then you'll want to make a point of adding this one to your collection today.",1409356800,,3067,4.450177935943061

507724,5,6302725542,"Twilight Time continues it's superb Blu-ray releases from the Sony/Columbia film archives with another stellar release of George Cukor's film version of ""BORN YESTERDAY""(1950). Like Twilight's previous outstanding Blu-ray releases from the Columbia film vaults of such B&W gems ""The Big Heat"" and  ""All the King's Men"" as well as outstanding color presentations like ""Oliver!"", Nicholas and Alexandra"", and ""The Way We Were"" just to name a few, it continues to offer both collectors and film lovers the best product available when it comes to home entertainment. That is certainly true of their recent release of ""Born Yesterday"". The story might be a little dated for audiences in 2014, but it holds your interest throughout due in no small part by Judy Holliday's outstanding performance in which she deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actress. Viewers today might be shocked by the verbal and physical abuse that her character ""Billie Dawn"" endures at the hands of Broderick Crawford but her sharp comebacks and perfect comic timing have you pulling for her until the very happy and satisfying ending of the film. With William Holden adding support, it doesn't get any better as far as the acting goes. Twilight's new Blu-ray of ""Born Yesterday"" is a wonder to behold. Although filmed in B&W the video is nearly pristine(Bitrate:34.97) with none of those annoying vertical lines, specks or damaged frames. Even the location shots around 1950 Washington DC with Holden and Holliday look great. Blacks, whites and grays are extremely sharp and well balanced throughout the film. Overall this is a major improvement over the standard DVD released by Sony years ago. The audio is crystal clear, so much so that you can easily hear Holliday's quips that she says under her breath when responding to Crawford's sarcastic and verbal assaults. Judy Holliday was a wonderful and gifted actress and her comedic performance in ""Born Yesterday"" ranks her right up there with Charlie Chaplin. Her untimely death at age 43 robbed future generations of a wonderful talent. Anyone purchasing this new Blu-ray from Twilight Time will not be disappointed. ""Born Yesterday"" is 103 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. The Audio contains only English 1.0 DTS-HD MA. Special features only include two theatrical trailers for the film. As per all their releases, included with the Blu-ray is a very informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo. (Note: I purchased this directly from Screen Archives Entertainment for less than what some sellers are asking) Twilight's new Blu-ray of ""Born Yesterday"" comes highly recommended and should be a welcome addition to any home film library.",1406160000,6,2715,5.227064220183486

507859,5,6302725542,"Today would have been Judy Holliday's 92nd birthday, and TCM is showing ""Born Yesteday"" as part of a three film birthday tribute to the late, great actress. Watching it yet again, on this her birthday, I wanted to pay my own tribute to her, in this her most famous performance.

Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) a loud mouthed, vulgar thug who is a multimillionaire from his junk empire arrives in Washington DC to buy a crooked senator to help advance his own shady deals.  Accompanying him is his gorgeous but dim witted mistress Billie Dawn (Judy Holliday); together they are entrenched in a luxurious hotel suite while Harry pursues his nefarious schemes.  However Harry's right hand man, former lawyer and politician Jim Devery (Howard St. John) and Harry worry that Billie with her lack of education and blunt, forthright manner may be a liability.  Accordingly Harry hires a bright young political writer Paul Verrall (William Holden) who has tried to interview Harry to educate Billie and smooth out the rough edges.  However as the saying goes, a little learning is a dangerous thing, as Harry finds out to his dismay.

Judy Holliday got her signature role of Billie Dawn on a fluke.  Garson Kanin originally wrote the play ""Born Yesterday"" with film actress Jean Arthur in mind; however she departed in out of town tryouts. Judy Holliday stepped in and as the clich goes ""a star was born"".  Still even though she wowed them on the Great White Way, she was almost passed over for the role when Columbia Pictures bought the film rights when studio boss Harry Cohn wanted to cast his rebellious superstar Rita Hayworth in the role.  However Garson Kanin who was retained to write the screenplay wanted Holliday, and enlisted his wife Ruth Gordon, friends Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy and director George Cukor to persuade Holliday to take a key supporting role in ""Adam's Rib"", a role to showcase both her talent and attractiveness.  Cohn was duly impressed, and Holliday got the chance to repeat her Broadway triumph.

Ms. Holliday is just wonderful, creating a deftly played, glittering gem, not just the standard stereotype of the ""dumb blonde"".  Her Billie Dawn begins as a vacuous, bored ex showgirl, but starts to emerge as a slightly tarnished innocent in her early relationship with Paul.  Under his tutelage, Billie begins to blossom, her nascent shrewd intelligence revealing itself.  As Paul and she develop romantic feelings for each other, Billie begins to question the emptiness of her life with Harry, and also develops suspicions that Harry is up to no good in Washington.  Ms. Holliday will make you laugh with her many priceless lines  rendered in her uniquely nasal tones, but she will also touch you as she tries so hard to make up for twenty nine wasted years in her crash course in higher learning.  Billie evolves and changes in a most natural convincing way, and Ms. Holliday turns in a multi-layered finely honed portrayal.  She looks sensational in her glamorous Jean Louis gowns, and had I think the most beautiful bare smooth shoulders of any film actress, ideal for kissing, nuzzling, caressing or nibbling! Ms. Holliday beat out two of the most iconic portrayals for the Best Actress Academy Award in 1950, Bette Davis in ""All About Eve"" and Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard"", in addition to obtaining a Golden Globe. While I'm not quite sure Judy Holliday should have won over Bette Davis at her peak as Margo Channing, her Billie Dawn was certainly more deserving than Gloria Swanson's hammy Norma Desmond. A better win for Ms. Holliday would have been for her tragicomic role as housewife Florence Keefer in 1952's ""The Marrying Kind"", again in a part written especially for her by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and expertly directed again by George Cukor. In this besides her usual comic sparkle, she reveals hidden depths as a fine dramatic actress. However, she wasn't even nominated, and so it goes yet another Oscar snafu.

1950 was William Holden's year for showing off his versatility with this film and the classic ""Sunset Boulevard.""  He's an admirable romantic foil to Ms. Holliday, with the requisite leading man dark handsomeness, but with enough good humored talent not to be overshadowed by Ms. Holliday, a passionately earnest hero with an engaging twinkle at times. As the ox like, bellowing bully Harry Brock, Broderick Crawford succeeds almost too well, at one point when he menaces Billie it veers uncomfortably into abuse. This is difficult to watch, as the viewer sees the terrible price Billie had had to pay for the furs and jewels over the years.

The witty screenplay was written"" officially"" by Albert  Mannheimer, with an uncredited assist by Garson Kanin, which contains many memorable one liners, most expertly delivered with a panache by Ms. Holliday. George Cukor delivers his usual meticulous direction, sophisticated comedy was his forte. Another pleasure is that a lot of the film was actually shot in Washington DC. What a joy to see such magnificent landmarks as the US Capitol Building, the Library of Congress, the National Gallery of Art and the Jefferson Memorial. circa 1949-50.  I've visit all of these several times, these and other Washington DC sights still always fill me with awe, wonder and pride at the greatness of our country, and give me a little thrill. It's nice to see these historic monuments have changed very little since they were filmed circa 1949-1950, gives one a feeling of continuity!

So a toast to the birthday girl Judy Holliday, who sadly like her comedic counterparts Carole Lombard and Kay Kendall died tragically young.  In Ms. Holliday's case it was cancer in 1965, at only 43 years of age.  However, she will always live in her immortal Billie Dawn, her film legacy is regrettably slim, only nine films altogether, but she's pure gold in all of them.  I recommend if you haven't seen them already, ""Adam's Rib"", ""The Marrying Kind"", ""It Should Happen to You"", ""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" and her final film of her last Broadway triumph ""Bells Are Ringing"".

In this tale, Galatea influences Pygmalion just as much if not more than Pygmalion influences her.

Billie Dawn is a beautiful girl who forgot to get in line when they were passing out brains, or at least that is what the script would have you originally believe. She has done the only thing she could in attaching herself to a wealthy but cruel man who keeps her in style but won't marry her. Things are changing though in that now this ill-assorted couple has come to Washington to conquer and Billie doesn't seem to be up to the challenge socially or intellectually. William Holden is hired to train her in the social graces and to give her the education she never had. The two are immediately attracted, under the unheeding nose of Billie's keeper.

He was able through his own beliefs to open her eyes to the truth and to appreciate right and wrong.  How different from the so-called journalists of today.  They have become prostitutes, especially in the way they covered Barack Obama  during the campaign.  They were thoroughly in the tank for him, hiding things the voters should have been made aware of.

It was refreshing to see how journalists used to be. Everything about this movie was perfect- the plot, the actors and a very satisfying ending.

While good actors starred in the remake, Judy Holliday really is Billie Dawn! Her chemistry with William Holden and Broderick Crawford is off the charts, and their comedic timing is phenomenal. A supposed dumb blonde, this ex-showgirl is anything but dumb.  She starts out believing that as long as she knows how to get the ""things"" she wants she has all the knowledge she needs.  But when a handsome reporter (Holden) arrives to get the story on Billie's crooked and abusive boyfriend (Crawford), he hires the reporter to ""smarten her up"".  Billie learns a lot during this process about herself and the ""things"" she really wants.  While Billie and the reporter are naturally and predictably falling in the love, they also discover that Billie has had control of the boyfriend's money and companies all along.  Since the boyfriend uses his money to illegally ""persuade"" government officials, Billie and the reporter use this new information to ""persuade"" her now ex-boyfriend to do the right thing before Billie and the reporter leave together and, we assume, live happily ever after.  Since All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard are 2 of my favorite movies, it would have been impossible for me to vote for the Best Actress Academy Award in 1950, but Judy Holliday deservedly won it for her portrayal of Billie Dawn beating out Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson.

Judy Holiday plays a kept woman who is blissfully ignorant, often drunk, and wrapped in furs. Her thug tycoon boyfriend is embarrassed of her faux pas during a meeting with a Congressman and his wife and so hires Bill Holden to put some smarts in her. He starts her on Enlightenment thinkers and she comes to realize she is living in a gilded cage. By the end, the thug becomes threatened by her knowledge and new-found independence and tries to rein her in, but she outsmarts him and leaves. The two things that weigh this movie down are the ""Gee, ain't America swell"" tone of Holden's teaching -- it seemed parochial and out of place with his character -- and the tacked-on ending where Holiday and Holden get pulled over by a motorcycle cop having just gotten married. By the third act of the movie, she was ready to leave and explore the world on her own terms.

Judy Holliday shines like gold; Cukor always could bring out the best in his leading women. William Holden and Broderick Crawford also give solid performances.

The action begins when a rather boorish, rough and tough guy named Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) comes into Washington, D.C. with his entourage to get some legislation passed to help his multimillion dollar business. With Brock come his ostensibly dumb blonde girlfriend Emma ""Billie"" Dawn (Judy Holliday) and his assistant. Before long it's obvious that Brock's girlfriend Billie needs some social refinement lessons; therefore Brock hires savvy reporter Paul Verrall (William Holden) to ""teach her the ropes."" That way Brock can impress the congressman he wants to create legislation to help his business.

Unfortunately for Brock, however, the social refinement lessons Paul gives to Billie eventually result in Billie's becoming more and more sophisticated and educated than Harry himself! Harry begins to feel small as Billie starts to outshine him; she's not a ""dumb blonde"" after all.

Of course, the plot can go in many directions from here. Will Harry make Billie stop taking refinement lessons from Paul? Will Billie like becoming more refined? Will Harry's investment pay off--will Billie's new found social graces and knowledge make it easier for Brock to influence a congressman? Watch the movie and find out!

The cinematography is great in the scenes filmed around Washington, D.C.; and the choreography works well in scenes near the end when people must confront each other at the end of the movie.

Unfortunately, although there are funny moments in this film, there are some rather dated and sappy lines to contend with. ""Knowledge is power"" somehow seems outdated; and listen for some high and mighty ""stuff"" about how you just can't buy the people we elect to Congress. OUCH! On the other hand, I agree with people who note that the scene in which Billie and Harry play cards is very, very well done and humorous as well.

The DVD extras offer us a few trailers and some vintage advertising.

Overall, Born Yesterday is a dated but somewhat funny movie that you can enjoy if you like this type of film. The actors just aren't given enough by a script I think is strictly average. The acting outshines the script by far.

He uses his dizzy girlfriend Billie (Judy Holliday) as a middleman, though he really controls everything she ""owns."" She is just content to accept his lavish gifts and be pretty. That is until Paul(William Holden) comes along. He is hired by Harry to educate Billie; she embarasses him in front of sophisticated company. In the process, she learns just how corrupt her fiancee is and why her father has disowned her. She also develops eyes for her teacher.

Holliday won the Oscar for her performance in this film against such professionals as Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson. Indeed, her performance is wonderful. One can watch her character transform before one's eyes from a gold digging chorus girl to an intelligent woman. Her relationship with Holden is believable and powerful.

508049,3,6302725542,"This original Oscar-winning movie starring Judy Holliday was clever, witty and wise.  It was shown on TCM with Nick Clooney guiding us with his winning ways into the mood of the Forties.  He couldn't have seen the original at the theaters, either, as he and I are the same age, so I know I didn't see it when I was only ten.  I thought the moll was ditzy and pretty dumb with a silly-sounding voice.  In Pulaski, Nate Street from Hickman County, a radio personality who liked to be thought of as a drama critic as he always attended dress rehearsal of the college plays, voiced his like for this crazy dame.  So, I thought that if he thought she was so good, as she was in ""Bells Are Ringing,"" maybe he was right again.

Today, I saw a revival of ""Born Yesterday"" with my favorite local actor as the genius, Paul Verrall.  He was splendid as I expected, though he did not have the Washington, D.C. accent.  The whole performance was professionally done at the Clarence Brown Theater here.  Previously, I was lucky to have stumbled into a performance in which Terry Weber was a one-man play about Abraham Lincoln/John Wilkes Booth and have never enjoyed a performance of any play more.  He has an unusual talent to be serious, musical, and sometimes funny.

The play centers around political corruption in which Billie becomes unknowingly involved.  That is, until Paul tutors her on proper ways of thinking and talking so as to 'fit in.'  Judy played to the camera and acted as a silly, dumb blonde.  Today, the actress was unusually clever in adopting Judy's unique way of speaking but showing how easy it is to change practically overnight into an educated woman who can fall in love and not just be used by a rich man.  She was smart enough to take her furs when she left him.  Broaderick Crawford, known for ""Highway Patrol"" on television, could not have been as brutal as Neil Friedman from Chicago as Harry Brock.  He didn't even use his Chicago accent.  That was good acting to say the least.  Terry was the star of this revival of sorts, a revolution against violence and money laundering of any kind.",1157846400,,2109,4.5611702127659575

508051,4,6302725542,"When someone says he was not BORN YESTERDAY it usually means he has at least an iota of intelligence. Well, Billie Dawn (Judy Holliday), blonde showpiece of crooked Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford), was BORN YESTERDAY - amplified by a voice reminiscent of Jean Hagan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SINGIN-IN-THE-RAIN/dp/B00004RF98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SINGIN' IN THE RAIN</a>!

While Harry is in Washington to grease palms of corrupt politicians and increase the size of his ""junk"" empire, he realizes his uncouth heartthrob is a hinderance to his reputation - forget that his own personality is not all that winning. He hires journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden) to give his lady a crash course in ""culture."" The immediate physical attraction grows stronger as her head becomes filled with actual knowledge.

Billie was fine as long as she signed papers she didn't read, kept her mouth shut, absorbed insults, and sat around looking pretty. With her newfound ""culture"" she begins to peruse contracts, ask questions, volley insults, and walk away from arguments. Paul wanted a big story. And through Billie, he gets one.

As ""one of the most successful comedies in Broadway history"" BORN YESTERDAY ran 1643 performances with Holliday as the lead in 1200. The equally successful screen adaptation raked in five Academy Award nominations, including Best Actress for Holliday as Billie Dawn.

I enjoyed the humor of an unforgettable Billie - the timing and admittedly irritating tone of her voice made simple statements funny. You may even feel sorry for her lot in life - plush as it may appear. Nevertheless, this is a movie of triumphs. Through all the insults and pure stupidity, there are virtues and victories.

Favorite quote: ""You are not one of my constituents by any chance, are you?"" (Fidgety Billie begins rocking back and forth while she raises an eyebrow in the direction of a dictionary on a pedestal.) ... ""I mean are you one of the people who voted for me.""",1153699200,3,2028,5.325

508053,5,6302725542,"Delightful!  Hilarious!

How often do we get to see a perfect performance?  We're closing in on a century of movies and, as we can see, it's pretty rare.  So flawless was Judy Holliday's portrayal of Billie Dawn that, as a relative unknown, she came from behind to beat out two heavyweights for the Oscar in 1950.  I'm sure this was due in no small part to her refining the role for nearly three years on stage.

Everything else fell into place as well.  Broderick Crawford was just excellent as Harry Brock.  Crawford is able to swing you back and forth between anger and sympathy for his character.  Not an easy task!  William Holden is perfectly calm and reserved as Paul Verrall.  His character forms a wonderful opposite to Billie.  And, with direction, George Cukor worked his usual magic.

Most of the themes are timeless.  A person lives in ignorant bliss until their eyes are opened.  They realize that there is a better life for them and begin their struggle for improvement.  They discover that their greatest opponents to advancement are not those above them, but those at their current level.

A few of the elements are dated.  Particularly Jim's speech about how hard it is to find a corrupt politician in Washington.  Wow.  Maybe that was the case in 1950.  Now it's impossible to find an honest one.

It all comes back to Judy Holliday.  This movie is her vehicle.

It is one of the most quoteable movies I've ever seen.  ""Would ya do me a favor, Harry?  Drop.  Dead.""  ""You're just not couth!""  ""I should take this pencil and draw a circle around YOU!""  ""If there's a fire and I call the engines... who am I double-crossin?  THE FIRE??""

She was a rare talent who we were only able to see for a very short time.  I love all of her movies and this one, Born Yesterday, is my favorite.

Thank you Judy!!!!!!",1146700800,25,1822,4.521604938271605
508054,5,6302725542,"I really like William Holden in the early 50's: he was fresh, full of energy, upbeat, physical - and when he put on glasses, as he did in Born Yesterday, intellectual and vulnerable. He was the perfect leading man, and very enjoyable to watch in this film. But the real star of Born Yesterday is Judy Holliday, who won an Oscar for her performance. Her character, Billie, goes through the greatest change in our story, and shows off her incredible range.

She starts out as the dumb-blonde squeeze of a big-shot con man, Harry, played wonderfully by Broderick Crawford, who made his millions in the junk business, and has now come to Washington to ""buy"" a senator in order to help his business. When he drops Billie into her first Washington social engagement, he realizes he's going to have problems with her: she ""just ain't couth."" So he hires William Holden's character, Paul - a writer and self-styled intellectual - to smooth out her rough edges. Paul is immediately attracted to Billie and agrees to take her under his wing. What results is a crash course in US History, Government, Civics, etc., with Washington as the classroom. A by-product is that Paul and Billie fall in love.

Now Billie really becomes a problem, as she starts questioning all of Harry's decisions, especially his attempt at controlling a United States senator. Billie must decide whether doing the right thing, as Paul advises, is worth losing her life of leisure, and even losing her life, since Harry is now threatening her. In spite of the gangster undertones, it's full of laughs, attractive costumes and sets, and a priceless view of Washington in 1950. But more than that, it's a real education on the power of an individual to do the right thing, and how it basically takes the same thing to maintain freedom in an individual life as it does in a democracy. Directed by George Cukor, Born Yesterday is a delight to watch, especially Judy Holliday - and Holden ain't no slouch either.

Before being filmed this was a play on Broadway, and it ran for 1,600+ performances, giving Holliday a chance to really hone her part.

508058,5,6302725542,"1950 was a banner year for movies, with such outstanding films as ""All About Eve"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and others. What sets these movies apart from the travesties that are churned out these days is the quality of the screenplays. Unfortunately, all that was soon to change. The spectre of the House of Un-American Activities was just about to descend like a pall on the movie industry and within a few years many of the most talented and creative scenarists were blacklisted for their poltical points of view'
But in 1950 it was still possible to make a BORN YESTERDAY with its hilarious caricature of the corrupting influence of wealth and power.
George Cukor was the master of stage adaptations that relied on such high brow elements as fine writing and committed acting performances rather than gimmicks and flashy sets to get the point across. As early as 1933, Cukor had displayed his mettle with the classic comedy ""Dinner at Eight"". It was an injustice that Cukor was not given the recognition of his genius until 1964 for his ""My Fair Lady"" (not his most typical work), but then Cukor's lifestyle was not exactly ""mainstream"" for his times and it is easy to imagine a Joe McCarthy poring over his file with a furrowed brow.
Anyhow, Cukor's talent was recognized in the many actors and actresses who won Oscars under his direction. And Judy Holliday's is simply the best. In her first scene she says nothing, but her looks and bearing hint at sophistication. So it's quite a shock  when she opens her mouth in the following scene and with one word demolishes our preconceptions.
Judy is at her best when she says nothing, such as in the famous card scene, or even better, when she commiserates with a beleagured Congressman and throws a wistful glance in the direction of her new found ally, the English Dictionary, when the Congressman inquires if she is one of his constituents.
I purchased this DVD back in February but only got the opportunity to view it last week. Much to my chagrin, the last ten minutes were digitaly distorted to the point where the climatic final scene was indecipherable. I tried it on another DVD player with the same unhappy result. Amazon only honours refunds and exchanges for 30 days after date of purchase, so it looks like I am stuck with a flawed masterpiece, like the armless Venus de Milo!
Also, Amazon advertises this release as a ""Widescreen"" production. I had been labouring under the impression that 1953's ""The Robe"" was the first feature length foray into Cinemascope widescreen.

Come to think of it, he WAS menacing, remember when he hit her?  There was very little humor of any kind in this flick (what there was, aside from two or three genuine witticisms, came from Holliday's supposed dumbness), it was very serious and far from light.  I disliked the adaptation from stage to screen, particularly and emphatically the ridiculous ending in the car when Holden gives the cop his marriage license.  Good grief!  I do not like Garson Kanin anyway, on Bway or off, I think he's very dull and unfunny, and think he writes better when working with his strident wife Ruth Gordon (like on another Holliday flick, much warmer and gentler and more human and more humane than this one, ""The Marrying Kind,"" finally out this month on DVD).  I was surprised to read Holliday's competition for the Oscar, she was definitely good, but THAT good?  All three of them should have gotten an Oscar.

Here, she simply stoles the show as the dumb, vulgar, low-brow, blonde, ex-chorus girl (Billie, ne ""Emma"") and lover of an unscrupulous and corrupt ""junk"" millionaire, played with great skill by Broderick Crawford, one year after his flawless Academy Award Winner performance in the excellent ""All the King's Men"", who learns ""how to think and to use her brains"" with the aid of writer Paul Verrell (William Holden).
Holliday won an Academy Award for this performance, in one of the most polemical winnings of the A.A. History, because she defeated both Bette Davis (for ""All About Eve"") and Gloria Swanson (for ""Sunset Boulevard""), and many people felt she shouldn't have won. Anyway, there's no denying that she gave and expert and very funny interpretation of the sassy Billie, with all the mannerisms, voice inflections, hollering,etc, especially in her scenes with Crawford.

In this movie adaptation of the Garson Kanin play, directed by famed ""womans director"" George Cukor, she takes a wonderfully written character and turns her into a classic movie performance that no one else could have played. Her crass, monosyllabic Billie is SO dumb, that, when her corrupt bully boyfriend, played by Broderick Crawford, first proposes to the owlish journalist, played by William Holden, that he refine Billies rough edges so she can be presented into the Washington society that he hopes to manipulate, well...you wonder how he can EVER mold this dim-witted clay. Along the way, she, for the first time, begins to actually THINK, and her development of a conscience and awareness of her self worth is as moving as it is comical. The backdrop of corrupt politicians who can be bought for a price (some things never change), provides the moral (immoral) climate in which Billie has unquestioningly (til now) existed. Seeing her grow into someone with character is touching to behold. In the scene towards the end, in the Rotunda, where she finally realizes the changes within her, and the potential for the ""good"" in life, it always brings a tear to the eye. As everyone knows, Judy Holliday beat out the toughest competition ever, Bette Davis for ""All; About Eve"", and Gloria Swanson for ""Sunset Boulevard"", to win the best actress Oscar for 1950. A good friend of mine, who knew Judy Holliday, and is presently writing a play about her life, corroborates what many already know, that she was an intensely serious and intelligent woman. Tragically, she died much too young. But her film roles will always ensure her reputation as a brilliant actress, with her portrayal of ""Billie Dawn"" being the role for which she'll most be remembered.

508103,5,6302725542,"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema.

He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light.
The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.
