8267849,5,B0017Z4YCW,"I bought this DVD from Deborah's website, Women that film, or some name close to that..and I assure any one of you, this is a JEWel ( made about and by  Jews)  of a film. I do not regret at all, paying the hefty price I paid from her website! I saw the free trailer on YouYube, and I was hooked!!!
Doris is one of the sweetest  people I ever ""met"" in my life..I feel as I know her from the MANY, MANY times I have watched it. I just love Deborah too...I have let several of my family and friends watch it too..they all loved it, enjoyed it immensely..after all, They are Gods' Chosen people, and it is only  expected that it would be a wonderful documentary, tragically about a very sad situation, which is, Doris losing any memory at all of Deb, it is just sooo captivating!!!! I love this DVD , it is one of my all time favorites!! You will too!!",1452211200,,848,4.121212121212121

8267851,1,B0017Z4YCW,I was very disappointed as I had purchased this for a class that I teach.  it was defective.  the problem was that lines kept running through it.  the film itself is excellent as a teaching tool.  I wish new copies were available.  I guess I will not buy used VCR tapes again.,1350086400,,276,4.230769230769231
