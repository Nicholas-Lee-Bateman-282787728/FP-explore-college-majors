8582162,3,B00CIRCGHS,This seems to be a DVD of a Glyndebourne production of Verdi's Macbeth - but the reviews all seem to refer to a Liceu (Barcelona) production with a different cast.  This is just an observation - I have not seen the DVD of either production.  my rating is made simply because I have to check one of the stars.,1433548800,,308,4.203389830508475
