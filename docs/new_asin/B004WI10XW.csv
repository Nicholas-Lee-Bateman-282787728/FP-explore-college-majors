4486510,1,B004WI10XW,"Dawning (Gregg Holtgrewe, 2009)

An attempt at a home-invasion thriller with a possibly-supernatural bent that fails on both counts. Calling it slow would imply that it had a pace at all. The characters are shallow, which actually makes them a pretty good fit for the actors. But the real failing here is the plot, which meanders like a naked mole rat on acid before finally deciding, far too late, where it wants to go (not that it ever gets there). This is one you can safely avoid. *",1407283200,,486,4.5227272727272725
4486511,3,B004WI10XW,"The Dawning (2009) features a family at a cabin in the woods, facing an unknown danger.  The film puts in a lot of effort into setting the stage for something big to happen, and features some violence, but mostly fails to deliver the kind of embodiment of evil, that many horror fans have typically come to expect.  While some may regard leaving much to the imagination, a refreshing approach in a clichd ridden genre, others may feel disappointment at the absence of a definite and identifiable threat.

Somewhere in Minnesota, siblings Chris (Jonas Goslow) and Aurora (Najarra Townsend) arrive at a cabin in the woods, where their father Richard (David Coral) and their step-mother Laura (Christine Kellogg-Darrin) are staying.  As the family gets reacquainted, various issues come to the surface, and an edgy situation becomes critical when the family dog is gravely injured, causing Richard to shoot her with his hunting rifle.

The family is still in shock, when a strange man (Daniel Jay Salmen), bursts into the house and attacks the family.  He manages to get hold of the rifle, and hold the family at bay, while peering outside looking for some kind of threat.  The man says that his girlfriend is dead, and that they are in danger, but doesn't explain why.  The family manages to overpower the man and tie him up, but bad things begin to happen, when they venture outside of the house.  There is apparently some kind of evil presence in the forest, which has the ability to affect people, and cause some to become violent.  This evil force or entity is never seen or indentified.  Aurora and Chris attempt to escape the danger, but it may be too late.

Co-writer and director, Gregg Holtgrewe says that the decision was made not to specifically identify the threat, which at one was envisioned as some kind of demonlike creature.  A low budget independent production, Dawning garnered some recognition and awards on the festival circuit, so there is some appreciation for a horror tale that features an undefined threat.  With most of the scenes taking place at night or indoors, Dawing features some pretty good cinematography, and is fairly well acted, although sometimes the dialog is not particularly strong.  Unfortunately, despite some positives, the film probably doesn't deliver quite enough to satisfy the mainstream horror audience, who generally have high expectations, and are accustomed to graphic violence.

Generally, keeping the threat under wraps, is an effective device for building up suspense, and then showing it doing something violent or evil, helps to generate fear.  In Jaws, for a good while, all you see a shark's fin, until it leaps out of the ocean and onto the boat.  In Dawning, you get a lot of ""fin"", but not much ""shark"".  While atmospheric, with a nebulous story that leaves a little too much to the imagination, the film makes less of an impact than it might have, with a conclusion that could be disappointing to some.

The DVD extras include a behind the scenes featurette, deleted scenes, and a number of commentary tracks.  The overall focus is mostly on providing some idea of the challenges involved in the making of the film, which was shot over several years.",1334188800,4,3213,4.912962962962963
4486512,1,B004WI10XW,"DAWNING uses the disintegration of a dysfunctional family as the basis for a supposed horror movie.  It also throws in a seemingly demented stranger who warns the family that some ""thing"" is waiting outside to kill them all---something EEEEEVIL.
The movie talks you to death, the acting is pedestrian and it's all boring!  There is no conclusion and during the end credits, it has the audacity to request you go the website and tell what you think IT is.
I don't think the writer even knows what IT is.  This movie simply stinks.",1332460800,2,529,4.666666666666667

4486514,1,B004WI10XW,This is not scary AT ALL!  I was so bored I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Incredibly lame.  The people who gave it good reviews must have been paid to do so.  Don't waste your time!!!!!!!!,1312848000,6,192,3.973684210526316
4486515,5,B004WI10XW,"Dawning is an existential thrill ride that unnerves fears of the most common and destructive sort, those that involve the disintegration of a nuclear family unit.  Dawning is an important contribution to the modern Independent film lexicon, invoking dark and nuanced aspects of the human psyche, while engaging the audience in, what for most of us is an uncannily familiar situation.  When watching this film, we are reminded that life, death, and family are all part of our shared human condition, whether we like it or not.",1305504000,6,525,5.022988505747127
4486516,5,B004WI10XW,"Most horror movies attempt to frighten its viewers by amping up the external scare factors. The cinematic landscape is littered with masked killers, man eating aliens from beyond and ghouls that have risen from their graves with sights set only on carnage and death.

However, it's the films that internalize the horror that more often than not stick with us the longest. Movies that prey on its characters own internal fears, self doubt, and sometimes self loathing can scare us the most. No greater monster exists than the ones we create in our own heads. Dawning understands and exploits this idea. With his film Dawning writer/director Gregg Holtrewe created a minimal budget psychological horror masterpiece.
Chris and Aurora (Jonas Goslow & Najarra Townsend) set off to spend a weekend at the remote log cabin with their father Richard (David Coral) and step-mother Laura (Christine Kellogg-Darrin). From the outset, the visit is marred by the fractured relationships within the family. Chris clearly fails to live up to his father's lofty expectations, and as Richard struggles with a hinted at alcohol problem, he finds himself in no position to see how his sometimes scathing comments wound his son. Meanwhile, the wounds from the divorce have not healed over and Laura can't help but feel like an interloper amongst the family, in do doubt to the thinly veiled animosity Aurora projects at the new wife. The college aged aurora can't help but feel her family is coming apart at the seams and she fights against her own issues of abandonment and loneliness.

An awkward family get together takes a turn for the terrifying when Aurora finds the family dog bloodied and on Death's doorstep. As confusion sets in as to who or what could have done this to their beloved pet, the family is thrown for a further loop when a blood-caked and strung out stranger stumbles into their home, getting the drop on them and holding them hostage. From this point on, near chaos ensues. While the stranger insists something is out there and it has killed his girlfriend, no one can come to any sort of agreement. Should they listen to the stranger, turn him in to the cops or kill him themselves? Fights break out, old wounds are ripped open and one by one each member of the family find themselves alone. The terrifying situation the family finds itself in amplifies any fracture that exsists between them as well as any internal fears or doubts. Each person is done in by their in ability to get a handle on their worst internal fear.

Holtgrewe does well to confine the majority of the film within the restricted confines of the cabin home. The claustrophobic atmosphere seemingly presses in on its inhabitants, adding layers of stress as they continuously internalize their fears and self doubt. He also makes a wise move by never giving even a faint whiff of what might be out in the woods. The power of Dawning comes from the fear within each character. Though the film hints strongly at some sort of otherworldly presence, the events could almost as easily be chalked up to each characters own paranoia and self doubt. The audio in dawning is outstanding, especially the bits containing what I'll refer to as ""hidden"" dialogue. At key moments in the film each person hears the absolute thing they least need to, a bit of conversation that will set them on edge with guard raised. Yet because the sound bites come from off screen, we're never sure if they were actually spoken, if they exist inside the wounded party's head or if an unseen evil is ""mimicking"" speech. What we do know is no one follows up on these barbs, as if the words being spoken out loud validated the self doubt that lived within. Fear of having those insecurities confirmed kept each characters mouth closed, and rather than pull together in a time of crisis, the family drifts apart, leading to their individual demise.

Overbearing, nothing-to-offer drill sergeant dad who has nothing to offer his kids--also trying to beat booze but can't.  Overly nice, and properly blonde and attractive stepmom trying too hard to please everyone and keep peace and wants to 'get you something' all the time.  A bleeding stranger bursting into the house, telling them they're 'all gonna die'.  Then he goes whacko.  They all go whacko.  Utterly useless conversations.  If there's something EEEEEEEEEVIL (as the stranger says) in this film, I think it's the guy who wrote the script.  Oh yeah.  Something's 'out there' because it gutted the dog but we never see it.

Continued to watch this movie out of hopes of making any sense out of it.  No such luck.  They never show what is really killing folks in the movie.  The closest we get to an answer is ""evil"".  I personally think they were destroyed by a really bad family dynamic.  Their family system was shot all to heck.  Alcoholism, a messy divorce, family resentments.  Thats what really did them in.

It is the type of film that leaves you pondering afterwards what happened.  We spend most of the film waiting for the monster or  creature to reveal itself.  But it's the type of movie that leaves you anticipating and waiting for something to happen and lets fear of the unknown or unseen scare you.  It doesn't answer some questions and leaves some problems unsolved.
