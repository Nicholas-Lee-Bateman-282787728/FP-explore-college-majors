8205013,5,B000SAIXU6,"The historical figure of Frederick the Great may not be known today very well but in Third Reich Germany at least three films were made of the Prussian king as he overcame great odds to unify the German lands against the Austrian Empire and stave off invasions by the Russians, French, and Sweden. A remarkable film on its own merits that has withstood the test of time. Any film studies student with interest in this time period should see it. As far as any inserted propaganda there is minimal evidence other than a few repeated lines of patriotic duty to fatherland that any military picture of any era would espouse. The film does not glamorize war and shows both the noble and selfish sides of a king that knows he can make mistakes that affect his people. Otto Gebuhr puts in a remarkable performance as Frederick.",1491091200,,820,4.623287671232877

8205016,5,B000SAIXU6,"""Der Groe Knig"" (""The Great King"") was released in 1942 and chronicles a desperate time for ""The Great"" Frederick II. As this film opens, Frederick's army is in partial retreat and any good news is difficult to come by. I write ""partial retreat"" because commanders as tough, poised and resourceful as Frederick are seldom in ""full"" retreat. Otto Gebhr plays Frederick and does a fantastic job of it. Much like Emil Jannings as ""Ohm Kruger"" (another film I highly recommend), Gebhr's skills are ridiculously superior for that period in film making. Despite the requisite occasional clunkiness of filming for that era (grainy audio, jumpy editing), the sweeping battle scenes in ""The Great King"" were very well done and satisfyingly-epic.

I've always appreciated the efforts of film makers who take-on such gargantuan tasks and Veit Harlan's direction in this film was impressive, to say the least. Not only are we watching Gebhr's excellent portrayal of an exhausted, yet steadfast Frederick, but there are several fringe characters who provide a depth needed in a nationalistic project such as this. Yes, the film is overtly patriotic and unabashedly pro-ethnic German, but I do not feel this tone detracts from its storytelling at all. After all, did the film ""Patton"" attempt to make American's feel ashamed of themselves? Not at all.

Having been made in 1942, I would think it was a tad uncomfortable for German film makers to film the great exploits of Frederick II, as he marshaled his army for a great comeback victory... versus Austria -- a German ally in WWII. As the circumstances of history would have it, it is still a great period in German/Prussian history. One of the overriding themes of films made in Germany during WWII is that of ""reunification."" It was a rare time indeed, as this film serves as a test case in German ethnic pride among the outreaches of ethnic Germans everywhere. If you purchase this film, DO NOT cheat yourself by skipping the extras that detail the making of ""Der Groe Knig."" In my humble opinion, these backstories are always a treat and I enjoy how the film itself enhances these extras.",1451865600,2,2131,4.933147632311978

8205019,5,B000SAIXU6,"Surprisingly good movie. Battle scenes were epic in proportion, giving a grand scale, no close cropped shots giving the impression of grandeur, these were real and amazing shots of thousands of Prussian and Austrian soldiers and horses. Battle scenes were realistic as well.

Acting was top notch as well, nothing over the top.

Even if this wasn't a NS period movie, it would have been a good period piece historical film on its own. Highly recommend it for history buffs.",1401840000,8,473,4.9
