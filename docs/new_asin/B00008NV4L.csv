It was like a cross between Tales from the Darkside, Freddy's Nightmares and Tales from the Crypt with the music and the bevy of famous faces!",1401840000,,315,4.543859649122807

7985974,3,B00008NV4L,"I purchased this movie for one reason only: JOHN TAYLOR. I have to say that the film is okay. It was broadcast on VH1, and that is how I first saw it. I was excited that it was actually a DVD to purchase. I can only say it deals with a kinda sci-fi, paranormal kind of thing. The story is not cohesive and has separate segments to which I care only about the segment with Mr. Taylor. The film is meant to be kind scary film. It was ok.",1348272000,,435,3.898876404494382

Then,my friend,you must look STRANGE FREQUENCY.Funny & thrillin'little Horror-tales about Music!
Perhabs not for Music-freaks only!
It's a shame that VH1 just 2 DVD of this fantastic Serial produced.",1296950400,,310,5.617021276595745
7985976,5,B00008NV4L,"Strange Frequency is a series of short comedy/horror flicks that include Eric Roberts and Judd Nelson. The best short story is Room Servce which features John Taylor who plays a dark, mean character named Jimmy Blitz. Taylor shows anger and a true lack of concern for anyone but himself which gives his acting true credibility. He does get what's coming to him in the
shocking end.

The movie is great. But John Taylor creates another level of excitement with his acting talent. I rate this movie with 5 stars.",1203552000,,510,4.730337078651686
7985977,4,B00008NV4L,"Erik Palladino (""OVER*THERE"") fans, with a good sense of humor, will enjoy ""DISCO INFERNO"".

Best friends Buck (Erik Palladino) and Randy (Danny Masterson) are die-hard rockers, who crash their car into a pole late one night, after a Metallica concert.  They seek help from the only place available, a nearby disco nightclub, which appears to be stuck in a time warp from the 70's.  The owner of the disco enlists the help of ""hot disco chicks"" to try and persuade the rockers to succumb to the dark side, a/k/a disco!

Perfectly cast, cleverly written, and well acted, ""STRANGE FREQUENCY"" is worth buying for the ""DISCO INFERNO"" segment alone.",1149206400,,644,4.935185185185185
7985978,5,B00008NV4L,"STRANGE FREQUENCY, originally aired on VH-1, harkens back to the days of those wonderful anthologies like TALES FROM THE CRYPT, TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS, etc., and surprisingly, it works.  One of the best anthologies of recent years, STRANGE FREQUENCY gives us four different tales, all with a musical theme.  In DISCO INFERNO, we meet two hard core rock and rollers (Danny Masterson, Erik Palladino), who crash their car into a telephone pole and seek solace in a nightclub.  The club turns out to be a disco club, right out of the seventies.  The manager, Dante (Martin Cummins) is a John Travolta clone, and introduces the boys to some hot chicks.  Of course our rockers belittle and berate the disco scene, and find out there's more to the club than meets the eye.  Wonderfully performed, the ultimate resolution is obvious, but it has some nice twists, and lots of humor.  You also get to hear ""Disco Inferno,"" ""Der Kommissar"" and yes, ""YMCA.""  Tongue in cheek, it's a winner.  In ""My Generation,"" we meet Eric Roberts, a dinosaur from the past who listens to people like Bob Dylan, The Who and others from that generation.  He picks up hitchhikers heading for a rockfest in Seattle, and yes, he bumps them off because of their disrespect for his music.  His latest hiker, Christopher Masterson, is just like the rest, but he has his own agenda.  Marvelously played out, there are lots of laughs, and an ending that is appropriately fitting.  ""Room Service"" features Duran Duran's John Taylor as Jimmy Blitz, a has been super rock star, who is as obnoxious as they get.  Holland Taylor steals the show as the housekeeper who manages to get the room in shape after all of his wild parties.  When she reveals to a reporter that she has housekept for such stars as Sinatra, Jagger and Little Richard, she gets the headline Blitz wanted to restart his career.  To get revenge, he goes to outrageous lengths to destroy the room, each time finding it immaculately cleaned.  When he attacks the lady's cleaning cart, however, disaster ensues.  This is cleverly written and performed, and its ending is remarkably fun.  The final story, ""More than a Feeling"" takes the mood a lot darker, and has a chilling denouement.  Judd Nelson is very good as talent agent Martin Potter, who has this remarkable talent for picking out superstars, a true ""gut"" reaction that almost renders him incapacitated.  He is worried, though, because every star he has made (except 2) have died.  His latest is a female singer (Marla Sokoloff) who has gone multiplatinum, and now decides she's ready for a break.  Her brutish manager/boyfriend (Nels Lennarson) goes through the roof and Martin is concerned for her welfare.  His other discovery Dean (Adrian Holmes) is working as producer, as well.  What happens in the end is chilling to say the least.

STRANGE FREQUENCY is a very entertaining, witty and original collection.  I recommend it.",1102204800,8,2920,4.870182555780933
7985979,1,B00008NV4L,"Strange Frequency tells the tale of 4 short stories. The first one being 2 rockers, Danny Mastersen (That 70's Show, Dracula 2000) and Erik Pallidino (U571, E.R.) who end up crashing their car in a street pole and end up in a disco club. Soon they find out that they are dead and in hell. The second one is Eric Roberts (The Specialist, Best Of The Best) who is a hippie psychopath and picks up teens who listen to the new age of music and he kills them. He picks upa kid, Christopher Mastersen (Malcolm In The Middle, Campfire Tales), who happens to do the same thing he does. The 3rd story is about a rock star played by Duran Druan's very own John Taylor..Jimmy Blitz is the character's name. Well, Taylor crashes the room and the maid, Holland Taylor (George Of The Jungle, The Practice) who gets sick and tired of Taylor and his band trashing the room and the 4th one is about a agent, Judd Nelson (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The Breakfast Club) who gets headaches when he hears singing or something of that nature. It was a VH1 movie thing and I didn't really care for it that much, I only watched it for John Taylor, Judd Nelson and Danny Mastersen. Eric Roberts needs to find better quality work, he's getting too much into that region now where he makes bad choices in projects. Also starring Marla Skoloff (The Practice, Sugar and Spice). So all in all this wasn't for me. Sue me.",1098576000,3,1395,4.38996138996139
7985980,5,B00008NV4L,"Four hip short films with a twist,the best of which is ""Room Service"",in which real life rock icon John Taylor plays Jimmy Blitz,a caricature of the seediest hotel trashing guitar heroes.
He pits his wits against the hotel maid in a totally wild performance,destroying her efforts to restore the place to sanity every morning-after-the-night-before.
In a typical Strange Frequency ending,he gets his just desserts in the end.
The other three short films are about rock and pop also,and all of them will get you thinking,make you laugh and entertain you like no other.",1054857600,5,567,5.10752688172043
