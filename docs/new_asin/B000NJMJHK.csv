2770121,4,B000NJMJHK,"When I first checked this movie out in a local video store I wasn't expecting much. the first thing that turned me off was the that it was a Lifetime Original, not that lifetime movies are bad but they are usually very generic and over dramatic. But the cover of the movie had something that made me change my mind; the look kind of spooky so I picked it up. After viewing it I was surprised to say that it was worth the try, the movie is wonderfully paced and has a well brought out story.

The film begins with Jennifer (played by Tiffany Amber Thiessen) a young single girl who meets the wrong guy. At first this guy seems nice, wants to help, and even wants to marry and establish a family. Everything goes wrong when they start living together; he becomes a peeping tom and rapist. She begins to suspect on him when he arrives late and begins to lie. Now the story may be a bit generic but the actors do such a good job at bringing something new to an old story that in the end it feels like a whole different story. Great solid flick, it will make me think twice about Lifetime Originals.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5",1198540800,38,1126,4.208333333333333
2770122,3,B000NJMJHK,"Tiffani Amber Thiessen plays Jennifer, a woman who marries a man whose past is full of secrets. Initially Jennifer is happy when Chris asks her to marry him. He wants to join the Navy and he promises to protect her. But when they move to California strange things start happening on base--a peeping Tom starts looking in women's windows and eventually women start being raped. Jennifer's husband admits that he looked in some windows but promises that nothing else happened. Since Jennifer is pregnant, she decides to give him a second chance. When they return home to New Mexico, once again women are being raped and Jennifer begins to suspect that her husband is to blame.

The Stranger Beside Me is classic Lifetime. Tiffani Amber Thiessen has made some of my favorite Lifetime movies, including She Fought Alone, and she excels in her role as a wife who can't trust her husband. This movie isn't great by any means, but if you're in the mood for a little drama that will keep you entertained, you don't have to look much further than this.",1195257600,50,1043,4.699453551912568
2770123,5,B000NJMJHK,"What a surprise, after watching Eric Close in Magnificent Seven as Vin Tanner and Without A Trace as Martin Fitzgerald, to see him playing a totally remorseless sexual predator. Yes, he's really good looking and uses that beautiful smile, but he slowly makes it clear that there is something seriously wrong with his character. He and Tiffani Theissen look like your all-American couple, but one of them is a manipulator of the first order, and the other is vulnerable and trusting. It's fascinating to watch evil unfolding and Close makes you a believer mainly with his eyes.  There's obsession and insanity revealed in those baby blues.",1191196800,,638,5.018867924528302

2770168,3,B000NJMJHK,"The only reason I chose to watch this from an online rental site was because I wrongly assumed that this was a dramatization of Ann Rule's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-Beside-Me/dp/1416559590/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger Beside Me</a>which was about serial killer Ted Bundy. This 1995 drama is not about Bundy but another predator who is a serial peeping tom and rapist.

Tiffani Thiessen plays Jennifer, a young woman who is traumatized by a past experience and refuses to date until a nice and affable young man, Chris Gallagher (Eric Close) comes into her life. They date briefly and get married before moving to a naval base in California where strange incidents begin to happen - there's a peeping tom on the base and soon, women are getting raped. Jennifer begins to suspect her new husband when his nightly runs appear to coincide with these incidents.

Both leads are credible in their roles though in typical Lifetime fashion, the story smacks of melodrama. It was an interesting watch and will appeal to fans of Lifetime movies.",1275696000,6,1108,5.511764705882353
2770169,1,B000NJMJHK,"Imagine my surprise when I learned that ""The Stranger Beside Me"" is NOT a film version of the gripping biography of Ann Rule's shocking discovery that her friend Ted Bundy was the serial murderer they had been investigating! Rather, it is a typically lame, uninspired and hackneyed ""Lifestyle television event,"" that is to say, television for women who like to fantasize that men are all closet voyeurs, stalkers, rapists and murderers. Though I agree the acting was acceptable, the film falls into so many ""Lifestyle Network"" stereotypes that you can see the complete film after watching about 20 minutes of it. This film is strictly for the women who fall into the category I've already mentioned.",1267056000,6,699,5.0344827586206895

8178673,4,B000NJMJHK,"The Stranger Beside Me, 2003 film

A young man carries the body or a young woman into a shed. Later he is stopped by a policman. Step out of the car. Ann Rule gets a call from Ted. There is a flashback to when a Suicide Crisis Hotline gets a call. This call is traced, the police arrive in time. Ann Rule writes true crime stories. Three years later a girls body was found. The danger in hitchhiking is real. Ted volunteers for a political campaign. Ted has changed. Ann Rule gets a call about six missing girls, about one a month. Ted asks a young woman for help with a dead battery. [No good deed ever goes unpunished is a NY city saying.] How could a young woman disappear without a trace? There are hundreds of Teds who drive a VW in a hundred mile radius. How many match the description? They show how Ted picks up another victim - he pretends to be a cop - he has identification! Note how he affects familiarity! But she gets away! He tries again and succeeds.

Her body and three others are found. Then he is stopped by a policeman and taken in. Are those burglary tools? There are three missing girls in Utah. This makes the national news. Ted call Ann Rule for help. Did he see a lawyer? A publisher offers a book deal to Ann. The police concentrate on Ted Bundy and the circumstantial evidence. Ann cant believe it. An ex-girlfriend tells Ann about Ted and his behavior. Ted was released and is back in Seattle. He was raised by a single mother; his grandparents helped. Ted is found guilty in Utah and gets 1 to 15 years. Colorado wants to extradite him. Ann loves her work as a writer. Who humiliated Ted? Ann feels guilty in not seeing any signs in Teds behavior. Ted escaped from jail in Colorado and fled to Florida. He looks for another victim and enters a big house, going from room to room. He rushes out, a student screams! Then he is stopped and arrested. He is still a monster. Ted calls Ann Rule and still claims innocence. [Has his personality changed?]

Ted displays personal charm and acts as his own lawyer. Young women attend the trial; a fan club? Ted has a friend now, Kelly believes in him. An expert testifies about bite mark evidence. [Is this still considered reliable?] Ted shows his cleverness in answering questions. They jury says guilty as charged! A young woman tells how the victims resembled her. Ann learns more about Teds background. His grandfather was a violent man. A girlfriend testifies in favor of Ted. He proposes in front of a judge and she accepts. That makes them married under Florida law. Ted insists he didn't do the murders at that sorority house. Ted gets a death sentence, the judge comments on Teds personality. Ann Rule visits him in prison and asks about Sara Jane Sweeney. Can she understand Ted? Ted denies doing it still. Then he tries to put off the death sentence by offering to reveal where the missing bodies are! This deal is refused. The sentence is carried out.

But we don't know why he did it. Are some people just bad and get a thrill from killing? Is there anyway to determine this beforehand? Serial murderers are hard to catch because there is no previous connection between the victim and the killer. Most murders occur between people who know each other. Usually it involves love or money. Does the ease of travel allow serial killers the opportunity? Beware of any person who tries to manipulate your thinking, especially a stranger. This story tells nothing about Teds upbringing as a boy and teenager. Could he really have first killed at age fourteen?",1503532800,,3535,4.51875
