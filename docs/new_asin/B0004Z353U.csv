2156747,3,B0004Z353U,"This video is great for someone wanting to rehearse classical ballet and who also has some RECENT formal training in their background; but it was  hard for me to get back into the strict regimen and ""toes out""  routine after years away from the barre.  I found the tape boring because I  prefer more lively exercise videos that are more motivating than this one.  More importantly, Ballet Workout 2 was way too serious for an exercise  video that needs to ""hook"" you into watching it again and again.  Basically, it was no fun and I am returning it.",966988800,11,549,4.540816326530612
2156748,1,B0004Z353U,"very basic, and not challenging at all.  It was obviously made a LONG time ago, poor production quality. Not what you want if you are looking for a BARR workout.",1256774400,,161,4.366666666666666
2156749,5,B0004Z353U,"I have all three Ballet Workout DVD's. This one is my favorite. It is faster paced than the first one, but still not too fast to be confusing. I took ballet for 10 years when I was younger, so I knew a lot of the terms. She doesn't spend a lot of time explaining the terms, like she does in the first DVD. I prefer that, but it would make it harder for a total beginner (at first. You can always rewind to see something again until you've learned it.)

The stage set and the costumes are a little dumb. I prefered the ballet studio staging of the first one.

The patterns are faster and a little harder than in the first one, but I feel like it gives you a better workout.

I can feel that this video is helping me improve my flexibility, which is part of the reason I bought it.

I think that this is a good DVD. I use it ALL THE TIME. I have fun doing it (well, as much fun as you can have working out...) I would reccomend it if you are looking for something a little different. If you are a beginner I would suggest getting the first one, and working your way up to this one.",1218067200,,1079,3.9814814814814814

She says this training is one of the best!",1209859200,,77,4.2
2156751,2,B0004Z353U,"I was pleasantly surprised by Melissa Lowe's first Ballet Workout & enjoyed it almost as much as the NYC Ballet workout DVDs. Hers were done differently so it was a nice change of pace. She has great form, so watched her instead of the other students in that one & she would do a quick run-through alone so you know what moves to do. She didn't cue in that one much, but she did give reminders of posture, etc.

In this one, these are more intermediate students (2 guys as well) & more serious. The stage background & outfits... well, it wasn't a help, but it's not that important. The music was live w/basic upright & player, but found the music uninspiring. There was no fun involved unlike the first relaxed feeling one.
Before each movement, she only tells you the name of the movements you'll be practicing & what the French name/terms means in English. In the voice over during the movements, she only tells you, ""this is great for strengthening the calves... these faster movements are great for slimming the legs..."" There is no body posture help or telling you how to move your body at all.
LEVEL ONE
Floor Work - 5 min - warm-up had about 5 stretches: hand stretch feet, a wannabe yoga downward dog for calves, frog pose for groin/legs, yoga seated twisted spinal stretch & bent leg forward & bent backward stretch. Which is nowhere near enough & nowhere near as good as the great 10 minute stretching I got in her first one.
Barre Work - 16 min - the first 2 min on basic posture & keeping hips down on leg lifts.
Center Work - 7 min - A LOT of hopping/jumping
No cool down stretching
LEVEL TWO
Floor Work - 6 min - yoga seated straight leg fwd bend, reclined foot to hand stretch, seated russian & fwd split w/fwd & side torso stretch, yoga pyramid (standing head to fwd knee), yoga crescent, seated spinal twist again
Barre Work - 14 min - the first 10 min was exactly like the first level then some nice single leg in air balance work, also some standing & bringing one foot along side your shoulder
Center Work - 7 min - the first 3 min had some nice balance work & fast footwork, but then more jumping/hoping
No cool down stretching

I confess I only did up to the center work before I was bored silly. Even when up to the center work, my heart rate increased only once when they were all breathing heavy too & I did not feel any exertion. My balance is excellent from yoga so the balance work was easy for me.
I think this dvd is only for those who are serious about ballet & perfecting it rather then a simple relaxed toning workout & increasing body awareness like the first one or the NYC ballet workout.",1198540800,6,2624,4.3421588594704685
2156752,5,B0004Z353U,I loved the first dvd and got this one so I can alternate my workouts and not get bored and my kids like to join me as a bonus.,1168905600,,127,3.413793103448276
2156753,5,B0004Z353U,"As an intermediate-advanced dancer, I have looked for years for an excercise video that gives me the feeling, both physically and artistically, as an actual class. This is the closest I've found--for the first time I actually look forward to doing an ""exercise"" video, and feel stretched and energized when I'm done. The combinations are too short, so I usually do each one twice on each side, or do both floor sections, followed by both barres, etc.

I can't speak for beginners, but as an experienced dancer, this is a great opportunity to hear a live pianist and enjoy interesting combinations at home--and the centre work actually fits in my living room!",1106179200,28,658,4.875
2156754,4,B0004Z353U,"I took ballet for several years growing up and even got on toe. I stopped and came back to ballet when I was in my 20's. I have loved this video b/c it feels like my old ballet classes, is the right length of time, leaves me feeling like I worked out (and have improved my posture), and is a literal ""class."" I was looking so forward to receiving the New York City Ballet DVD and was sorely disappointed with the lack of ""class"" feel (even though it is very well shot) b/c I love barre work. (Also, if you want to look at a bunch of naked bodies . . . well, I prefer the ""good, old fashioned"" tights and leotard in Miss Lowe's workout way better -- way better)!
The only drawback I see (and I agree with other reviewers) is that I wish she had explained more of the moves as you do them. She never really explains them and then expects you to figure them out as you dance (while your eyes are down at the floor or following your hand)?!! You have to watch and memorize the tape before you can do the moves, frankly -- which if you have prior ballet experience is somewhat easy to pick up on, but frustrating, none the less, at least at first! I love the music she chooses, but the exercises are a bit short. I wish she had done them twice on each leg or made them a bit longer like many of the classes that I have taken. Still, I am happy and look forward to my ""class"" every day I do them. I recommend the second workout in her series for a more advanced dancer. Personally, I am still working on the first (even though I have enough ""knowledge"" to keep up with the second) simply b/c I need to get back in shape again. Enjoy your workout!
Oh, and Miss Lowe is a typical ""dancer,"" so I didn't expect to be ""entertained"" during her explanations. Her dancing makes up plenty for others' comments about her ""dryness"" of personality in reaching out to the video audience. I thought she was splendid, and is a beautiful dancer and example to follow! My understanding of dancing, and what I need to do to be a good dancer, is enhanced and strengthened by simply watching her . . .",1083110400,29,2075,4.177057356608479
2156755,3,B0004Z353U,"Oh my goodness Melissa Lowe is goofy... the leotards, the explanations, the pudgy assistants, the dancers' blank expressions.... That said, I think this is a pretty good *ballet class* rather than a workout, so you really need to have had some prior dance experience. Since I've got over 10 years of ballet experience, I thought it was easy to follow and fairly challenging to keep up with (she moves pretty fast--either you know it or you don't), but without experience I would have been totally lost, as the moves and steps are pretty complicated. While I broke a sweat and my legs ached, it was kind of a drag to keep one eye on the screen the whole time, because Lowe's cuing is bad, and I was always a beat behind the dancers. Furthermore, Lowe never really explains what you should be looking for regarding form or how it should feel and where, so the potential for injury is high (especially during the jumps!). Watch out ankles! The workouts are short, which is also kind of a drag. I really wanted to keep dancing a bit longer!
Apart from the goofy look and feel, my main criticism is that while this workout would be great to do in a real ballet studio, it's hard to do in your living room; the floor work requires a lot of space, and you really need a barre for the barre work. For a better workout I'd probably turn to the NY City Ballet Workout. Not only is is more attractive (the music and staging is better and the dancers are completely gorgeous), but it's a lot easier to follow. Also, it's more ideally suited to the home video format than Lowe's bizarro home ballet class.
And no fuschia leotards!",1025827200,31,1617,4.466216216216216
2156756,4,B0004Z353U,"If you don't have any ballet training, this video probably isn't for you.  If you do, though, it's a good follow-up to the first Ballet Workout.  The exercises are a little more elaborate and faster-paced -- also more engaging -- than in the Workout I.  There is more emphasis on balance, and a greater variety of steps.  M. Lowe does not explain or demonstrate the exercises in advance, which is what would make this tape frustrating for a beginner.  (But it would get pretty boring listening to her explain them every single time you ran through the tape, which is why I think she leaves out the explanations.  The first few times through, I just watched each exercise and then rewound.)  The pink and blue leotards are indeed headache-inducing, as someone else commented.  Overall, though, it's a good ballet class for intermediate or advanced dancers, with a good model to follow.",1007251200,39,884,4.80794701986755
2156757,2,B0004Z353U,"This is a ballet video for the workout-minded.  There is very little cueing and little explaination.  In the video, Melissa Lowe and 5 other dancers, including one male and one relatively ""heavy"" dancer perform 2 separate +/- 40 minute routines.  Each has a very short floor portion, which esp. on the second half, really wasn't long enough to get a good stretch, then barrework, and floor.  The pink and blue unitards are somewhat obnoxious.  The live piano though helps to soothe this.
The barre work is shot from a distance, with no close-ups of the feet or a single dancer.  The barre is set up in the middle of the set, so you see some dancers from front and back views, but no side views.  Strong previous ballet exposure is suggest (by me).  The step aren't explained well, but they are the basics, ya know.  There is not a good deal of technique cueing, that's good or bad depending on what you are looking for.",986515200,27,919,4.5212121212121215

8036303,5,B0004Z353U,"I took years of ballet lessons growing up. I've tried a couple ballet-workout DVDs that were disappointing. They were more focused on the exercise aspect and less on the dancing.
This one is like a ballet class! My kids, who have taken a year or two of ballet, find it far too hard to do, but I think it's the perfect level of difficulty.

I recommend this to anyone who has ballet experience and wants more of a ballet class style, and less of a turn-specific-steps-into-exercise (like 40 releves in a row).",1431302400,2,508,4.521739130434782
8036304,5,B0004Z353U,"Used to take ballet for years as a kid and young adult, en pointe as well. Now, years later, wanted to do something to help tone and keep my sense of balance that one loses as one ages. Tried yoga, pilates, nothing suited me. Got Melissa Lowe's Vol 1 and it's been a perfect reintroduction to ballet--perfect because I'm so out of shape but am still able to do the workout. It's like the ballet classes I used to take--stretching, bar work, center work. And Melissa Lowe is a very beautiful dancer.",1404518400,,498,4.423913043478261
8036305,3,B0004Z353U,"After progressing from rank beginner to a beginner/intermediate level with Lowe's earlier programs, The Ballet Workout 1 Shaping and Toning  Level One and The Ballet Workout 1 I Shaping and Toning Level Two, I thought I'd get a smooth transition to The Ballet Workout Vol. 2: Strength and Conditioning.  Not so.  There is not enough teaching happening before she goes to more complicated and difficult moves.  I wish there were a program or two between The Ballet Workout 1 I Shaping and Toning Level Two and Vol. 2.  Or did I miss something?  The titles are pretty confusing.",1398643200,,576,4.826530612244898

8036307,5,B0004Z353U,"This DVD makes a very appropriate sequel to Ballet Workout. That being said this DVD is tougher with less explanation and faster passes. The camera angles on this DVD seemed fine to me. I loved the fact that there were dancers from all different ranges. When I couldn't extend as high as Melissa I felt comfortable watching the slower dancers. The scene is odd yes but I don't feel the costumes are that bright or crazy as other reviewers have stated.

If you have a lot of patience then this DVD will be a great workout. it got me excited and made me sweat. I still feel a bit remedial at ballet so I only use this one once a week but it is great. Same idea as the first: level one and two, with floor barre and center work. On this DVD there is no instruction at all generally. If you practice you can get really down on this DVD. I have ballet experience and I tried this after using her first DVD for two months. I can actually get through level one but level two was crazy but I did most of the moves. I am excited for the challenge this DVD is. I really suggest trying the first ballet workout though before getting this one if you have no experience. i am sure you could master this DVD with lots of time and patience without purchasing the first one.",1367884800,,1258,4.198347107438017

8036309,1,B0004Z353U,"If you're looking to replicate a ballet class exactly, that's what this DVD is. If you're looking for a good workout with some ballet moves, this DVD is not worthwhile at all. There are lots of exercises that are good for preparing you to dance ballet but useless for general conditioning: for example,  point your foot, flex at the ankle, point again then back to starting position. It does include things like plies that are good for conditioning, but too few of these types of exercises to make the tape useful.",1346284800,,514,4.648351648351649
8036310,5,B0004Z353U,"Excellent for an at home ""class"". If you have taken classes for many years, this is a good DVD workout, especially the second portion. In a snap, you will remember the sequences. A nice workout for those who are no longer attending class at a studio; if you close your eyes, you can imagine being in class. And class ends with the classic reverence.",1282867200,3,349,4.46875
8036311,5,B0004Z353U,"Ignore the negative reviews and focus on the positive. Yes it is true that this was made in the late 80's or early 90's and the clothing style and background reflects this, but the live classical music and Melissa's perfect technique more than make up for it. I am a former ballet dancer and this is one of my favorite videos to workout to. I have some newer ones (Ballet Conditioning by Elise Gulan) and while they are good, the Ballet Workout 2 is more challenging and will actually help you with technique.",1261958400,6,509,4.483870967741935
