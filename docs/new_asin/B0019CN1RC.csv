3432552,5,B0019CN1RC,Okay this is how you do an exploitation thriller. I was shocked at how good and how tight the story was. Not one scene is wasted. It's just propulsive story telling at one of its best. You really do get a sense how scuzzy New York was back in the early 80's. The editing. The acting(special shout out to Zoe Lund who gives an INCREDIBLE performance). The direction. All top notch. This is not a time killer movie. It engages you on a deep primal level. Out of all the vigilante flicks this was hands down the best I've seen. Yeah I'm gonna go there...it's better than DEATH WISH. After you see it you might come to the same realization. This is gonna be one of those movies where the cult around it is gonna grow. Get on board because you'll be in for a wild ride.,1396137600,3,764,4.204081632653061

3432554,5,B0019CN1RC,"Nuns! Nunchakus! 50's-Style Neo-Greasers in yellow jackets getting blown away while trying to be helpful! This DVD of the film: Ms. 45 has all of this and more. But of course, if you've ever heard of this film, you knew that already. Note that this review is for the Drafthouse DVD; not the old DVD that seemed to be a victim of some sort of sabotage campaign where the anti-shoplifting detecting insert was maliciously glued to the UNDERSIDE of the DVD, thereby ruining it.

The transfer is NOT perfect; The occasional flecks and editing ""cigarette burn marks"" are clearly visible here and there.

But you get in the case with the DVD:

* A voucher for a FREE DIGITAL COPY via DRAFTHOUSEFILMS.COM
* A little booklet with essays by Kier-La Janisse, Brad Stevens, Paul Rachman and Zo Tamerlis Lund herself

And the extras on the DVD:

* Interview with Director Abel Ferrera
* Interview with Composer Joe Delia
* Interview with Creative Consultant Jack McIntyre
* Zo XO
* Zo Rising
* Trailers (Drafthouse)

3432558,1,B0019CN1RC,Every exploitation junkie knows the awesomeness of the 1981 underground rape-revenge thriller MS. 45 starring the late and beautiful Zo Tamerlis Lund. Unfortunately we're living in a nanny state where the censors think they know what's best for us. As if we can't handle the original uncut versions so they need to be our mommys and daddys and cut out key scenes so we don't get nightmares.

3432559,5,B0019CN1RC,"Ms. 45(DVD)
In the 1980's I saw this in London in about the only cinema that put it on, double-billed with Ferrara's slightly earlier equally notorious ""Driller Killer"".  Personally I hated watching ""Killer"" even though some perceive (gruesome) black humour in it and it is available on DVD in the UK.  ""Ms"" was hardly 'cheery' viewing either but I thought it was far more compelling and better made, having a certain kinship with Polanski's fine ""Repulsion"" (1965,b/w) about another deadly female protagonist (a very young Catherine Deneuve) that tears into your heart.  These are superior to anything that Michael Winner used to dish up. Ferrara's location filming in New York eschews shots of the Twin Towers and makes the city a quirky character in its own right (Polanski's London flat setting being more deliberately claustrophobic).  Ferrara does a great job with his mute gun-toting lead Zoe Lund (then Zoe Tamerlis) a seething flame preying on her male moths.  She was never in anything as memorable again and sadly died early, apparently of substance abuse.
M. Britton seems to have enjoyed a well-projected showing of this movie.  The Korean DVD to me does not seem at all deficient, it is pretty much as I remember from the 1980's and stands up well.  I am surprised that it is still not available for PAL-only players.

3432560,4,B0019CN1RC,"This is a hard movie to watch. Cut or uncut. This could be why it has a cult following in this twisted world of ours. This Korean import is matted at over 1.85 pillar-box (you can zoom to fill your 16:9 tv with little image lost) and it still look pretty good. I took off a star because it is not anamorphic. I have not seen a 4:3 letterbox in a LONG time. I wonder if this is the cut version? Leonard Maltin has the running time as 84 minutes, this version runs at 80 minutes. Cut or uncut, this is one violent little film...but it's good!
Why can't a good company give this a good DVD release with director commentary and special features is beyond me. I knew to avoid the Image version because of the editing...this too could be edited-I wouldn't know. Got it for under 20 bucks and its not bad for the price.

3432561,4,B0019CN1RC,"I had seen some clips of this film on a Abel Ferrara Documentary
which i found out was this MS.45 film
i thought to buy the Blu-ray version with new extras, if i was going to watch it just to check the film out
here's the main plot
Actress/musician Zoe Lund plays a Mute girl who gets raped a few times during the film
in the last 30mins of the film she finally snaps & gets herself a 45 revolver and shoots male offenders who thinks are going to rape her
or sexually assault her, in the last scene before the credits roll Zoe is at a Halloween party for her Work, she works for a fashion company
anyway her Boss makes a move on her trying to rape her well she snaps and starts shooting everyone at the party
one of her colleagues at the party gets a kitchen knife and stabs her zoe falls to the ground and dies & then the credits roll
i don't know what to think of the film actually, the rape scenes with Zoe Lund a very Graphic she was only 18 at the time
Drafthouse films who have Distributed this blu-ray version have restored the Unrated print for the first time in the U.S.
which contains the Graphic rape scenes & kill scenes, Honestly i had to fast forward some of the Graphic scenes
I can say that Drafthouse HD transfer of the film is excellent, very nice sharp & clear picture quality in 1:85:1 ratio
probably much better quality than the old dvd version
plus the sound quality is Master audio 2.0 stereo mix which sounds very Good

Drafthouse have also added new special features
new interview with Director Abel Ferrara recorded for this blu-ray release
the interview is short & sweet, Abel doesn't say much about MS.45 maybe cause he has nothing really to say about the film
he talks about the screenplay by Nick st John and says none of the scenes were improvised and that all the scenes were shot
page by page in the screenplay
Abel talks about Zoe Lund and says the main success of the film was on Zoe Lund
he keeps talking about Zoe and her Drug addiction
Abel also talks about Zoe's Heroin & Cocaine abuse after the film was released etc
and then he says the film is-what it is and then the credits roll, 7min 40sec interview
sounds to me Abel was not really interested talking about the film otherwise the interview would be longer, more detailed
there's also another 2 interviews, interview with Joe Delia who composed the music score-10mins
and a interview with creative consultant Jack Mcintyre-10min 30sec
there's also 2 short Documentaries on Zoe Lund
first is ZOE XO recorded back in 2004 which is Zoe's husband Robert Lund talking about Zoe's life and her Drug addiction
before she died at age 37 in 1999
Robert talks in great detail about Zoe's cocaine addiction and how she was snorting lots of it in her last days
hence her Heart attack back in 1999 only goes for 6mins but still interesting to watch and listen to
ZOE RISING which is a new 2011 short Doco on Zoe's Life told by Zoes' mother- 5mins
there's also the original Theatrical trailer & 32 page booklet about the new HD transfer and the film
there's also reversible cover art inside the case you can switch around the original poster art of the film if you like.
so if you love this Abel Ferrara classic, time to upgrade buy this new blu-ray version
3 stars for the film itself
4 stars for this new blu-ray version based on a new HD transfer & new extras",1458518400,6,3343,4.37459807073955

Blu Ray Review: Drafthouse Films version. This Blu Ray comes with interviews, two short films starring Zoe Lund and a booklet on s#!+. The picture and sound quality is good and in 1:85 ratio. HAPPY CRAP!

Movie Review: Some woman gets raped by a couple of guys. Then she goes on her period and decides to kill men. This is sort of the female version of Death Wish but leans more towards serial killer-ism, narcissism, misandrism, self-loathing and I suppose you could add vigilantism into the mix. The rape scenes are not really graphic which is good because if you want graphic rape scenes then you should be shot in the face with a shotgun. The violence is happy fun and the story which plays as a character study is good as well. And I'm glad the broad didn't kill the dog, otherwise I would of been happy she suffered. B!+(#! Me likey, likey this movie.

3432578,5,B0019CN1RC,"Ms .45 gets five stars from me because that's the most and the best you can give it.  This movie is unconditionally recommended to you by me as a must-see.  If you watch some of it and don't like it, that's okay; just chalk that up to ""this one's not for everybody"" and go on to something else (definitely twenty minutes is enough; the abuse the main character Thana = Zoe Lundberg suffers right near the beginning is hard to watch; and then she takes charge and we're really onto something, but ... you get the idea; it's really challenging but definitely worth it.)  Did you get that? the ""must see"" part?  You know how many movies I have ever said ""must see"" about?  Five, at the MOST.  Actually, the list is pretty much exhausted after High Plains Drifter; even Pulp Fiction -- and several others -- is five stars but not absolutely ""must see"".  Well, Ms .45 is not to be missed.  Like High Plains Drifter, though, you will have to watch it at least twice to get the nuanced performances and situations.  That's funny, too, because when you watch it closely you'll see that these actors are actually OVERacting, if anything; or maybe I'm just not that observant or sharp.  Check out Thana/Ms. 45's boss, I think his name is Harold -- the couturier dude; very complex character actually.  Never mind what he seems like at first glance or first screening.
I wasn't going to write hardly anything, just say ""must see"" and let it go at that.  Well, let me stick to that -- just watch this movie.",1430265600,3,1495,4.476014760147602

It shows a director learning the ropes, during a wild time in NYC, long before Times Square was disneyized by Guiliani. It is good they have it on Amazon Prime streaming. When he made ""King of New York"" (with a terrific cast), I loved it, even though it was ""Hollywoodized"" to a degree, and did not get good reviews from most ""film critics"".  Ferrara was furious he had to cut several scenes out to get it down to an ""R"" rating (so the producers would make much more) money. He pulled out all the stops with ""Bad Lieutenant"", with an NC-17 rating (very well deserved).  I saw it 3 nights in a row on opening weekend at The Angelica Theatre; the only independent theatre in NYC to show it. It blew me away. Absolutely the best performance by Keitel since ""Mean Streets""; maybe his best ever. Plus,it is so well directed. The Angelica had a very enlightened clientele. Knowing this, I was stunned when a couple of rows of people walked out, it was so strong. I'll never forget what Mr. Ferrara said in an interview upon it's release: ""I am not going to let a bunch of fat-as%&d LA housewives tell me how to make a film"". It has Zoe Lund in 2 scenes. The sad thing is, Ms. Lund died at age 37.

3432613,5,B0019CN1RC,"In 1992 director Abel Ferrara and writer/actress Zoe Lund shocked the world with 'Bad Lieutenant'. A decade before that they teamed up for the first time and created  1981's rape/revenge fever dream 'Ms. 45'. Both films are shocking and explicit in their depiction of sex, drugs, violence and nihilism. Both are uncompromising masterpieces.

Mute seamstress Thana (Lund nee Tamerlis) works in the Garment District and lives alone in a studio apartment. Surrounded by a flirty boss, gossipy co-workers and a nosy landlord, Thana feels intimidated and out of place. One afternoon while walking home from work she gets pulled into a grimy alley (by a masked Ferrara) and brutally raped. After staggering home a shell-shocked Thana is again raped, this time by a home intruder. Fighting back, Thana kills her attacker and hides his bloody .45  handgun in her drawer. Suffering from flashbacks, she's too shaken to use it. That all changes a few days later when she mows down a guy who charges her in an empty alley. Terrified at first, Thana soon becomes emboldened and gives herself a drastic makeover. She dyes her hair, pulls it back into a ponytail, slathers on red lipstick and squeezes into tight tops and leather pants. Setting her sights on men who get off exploiting women, Thana embarks on a killing spree. Feeling in control for the first time in her life, Thana becomes drunk with power and snaps. She starts dressing like Little Red Riding Hood and chasing men who pose no threat to her or anyone else.  The film culminates with Thana - decked out in a nun's habit and garters - descending on her office Halloween party like a literal Angel of Vengeance and laying waste to everyone.

The film is not without its flaws. For one, Thana is never in any real danger of being overpowered by her victims and aside from a front page newspaper report her crimes go unreported and the cops are neither seen nor heard from at all in the movie. That's a rather glaring omission in my opinion, but I understand this movie is supposed to be a revenge fantasy told entirely from the viewpoint of the main character. It's also pretty gory but what else do you expect when the director's previous film was called 'The Driller Killer'. (See if you can spot the poster in the background during the Halloween party). And no matter how reprehensible the on-screen antics are, you know you're watching two amazing artists at the peak of their talent behind the camera. This was only Abel's second feature film but the improvements in craftsmanship are remarkable. But obviously the star of the show is Zoe. She utters only one word in the entire film yet her performance is one of the most talked about in all of cult cinema. As Ferrara notes in his brief but emotional interview included on the immaculate Blu-Ray this is Zoe when she was 17 and had never touched drugs or alcohol. She was already a college student who spoke five languages, played music, wrote poetry, modeled, etc. Soon after 'Ms. 45' she got hooked on heroin and the two had a falling out. They wouldn't work together again until 'Bad Lieutenant' which they co-wrote together, though Lund claims she wrote it herself. Watching her in that movie - especially in HD - shooting up will turn your stomach. Seven years later she'd be dead in Paris at 37. Tragic stuff. It's obvious she was a tremendous talent. Though she wrote and acted in other films, her work with Ferrara is her most iconic. At least Abel lived long enough to get clean. Sober for two and a half years he's enjoying a career resurgence garnering rave reviews for his latest film 'Welcome To New York'. Thanks to that film and the re-release of this one he's finally getting the respect he deserves. It's taken 30+ years but now he's acknowledged as one of the most important and influential independent filmmakers of all time. If you're at all interested, buy this Blu-Ray immediately.",1403568000,2,3911,4.737151248164464

While I found it incredibly easy to sympathize for the pain and degradation she experiences, not to mention how much I completely understood her subsequent anger, I was unsure of where the character was going once she embarks on a killing spree of every man she perceives as a sexist lowlife whose ultimate goal revolves around controlling and using a woman's body until her soul is all that is left, which is every bit as wounded and unforgiving. Was she going to kill forever or would she eventually stop and start to live her life again? Since she begins to see all men as evil and decides to destroy even those who mean her no harm, there is only one way the film can end, so it becomes rather predictable on that note. Perhaps the ending would have been more interesting had this woman been able to see at some point just how much of her power she had allowed the monsters who victimized her early on in the film to strip away by changing her into something almost as ugly as they were.",1401667200,,1149,4.324074074074074

Thana is a mute woman who lives in a small. modest apartment with a nosy, loud landlady nearby at all times. She works as a seamstress in the Garment District in New York with a condescending, too friendly boss and supportive coworkers. The city as a whole is hostile to women shown in a variety of ways. Street harrassment is commonplace, shown as Thana and her coworkers walk to lunch with men lining the streets yelling lewd comments and then equally lewd insults when ignored or rebuffed. The situation is only slightly more over the top than realistic with the amount men and the frequency of their come ons and insults. This is still many women's experience even today. No one ever knows when one of those shouting men will attack the women they harrass, which is exactly what happens to Thana.

On the way home one day, a masked man accosts her in an alley and rapes her at gunpoint. It takes place in the first 10 minutes of the film. The scene is shocking and brief. Thana lays among the garbage, reeling from pain and shock, until she can gather herself and her belongings to walk the rest of the way home. Thana, relieved to be in the safety of her home, doesn't realize that a burglar has entered her house through the bathroom window. He also rapes her in a much more extended, graphic scene that ends with her smashing his head in with an iron. Thana cleans up her apartment, impassively cuts up her rapist into pieces, and puts his parts in garbage bags. The horror of the day hits her when she takes a shower and flashes back to the attacks as his viscera and blood clog the drain. This small moment encompasses Thana's trauma that she later tamps down underneath her anger.

Thana keeps the rapist's .45 gun and carries it with her as she goes to work. Bit by bit, she disposes of the corpse parts around the city in trash cans or on the sidewalk. One day, a man who harrassed her follows her with one of the bags she dropped and she tries to run. He corners her in an alleyway and she shoots him out of fear of yet another sexual assault, killing him. At first, she's sickened by the kill and runs home. Afterwards, her attitude changes when she realizes that she can get revenge by killing as many rapists and sexual assailants as possible. Her demeanor and dress change entirely. Confidence and sensuality replace her usual timidity. Bold combinations of red and black replace her usual wardrobe of drab colors. Her usually bare face is now colored with bold black eyeshadow and red lipstick. Thana invites attention now that she fights back when she tried to blend in to stay safe before.

Thana's reign of terror targets exclusively men. She starts by killing men who approach her, first letting them think she's an easy, oblivious mark. The men murdered include a predatory fashion photographer, a pimp beating a prostitute, a slew of gang members, a Saudi businessman and his driver, and a fired salesman. Some mistakes are made along the way, but she keeps up her crusade. These scenes are a reversal of what usually happens as Thana has the power over these men trying to victimize her and most likely getting away with it. It's honestly gratifying and cathartic to watch. The men of the city are now scared to be in public, an experience typically felt by women. Reality rears its ugly head when the men murdered are seen as innocent victims instead of the predators and criminals they really are.

From the beginning of the film, two people regularly condescend and infantalize Thana: her landlady Mrs. Nasone and her boss Albert. Mrs. Nasone is incredibly nosy and never passes up an opportunity to violate Thana's privacy. At the beginning of the film, Mrs. Nasone treats her like a child due to her disability, refusing to listen to her. Once Thana dresses and acts differently, Mrs. Nasone completely rejects her and deems her a bad influence. She practically has a heart attack when Thana says she's not going to be home one night. Apparently having a romantic relationship (which she falsely assumes) is completely beyond the pale for a disabled person. Thana's boss Albert treats all of the women poorly, tearing their clothes apart and screaming at them in front of everyone. He treats Thana as if he's doing her a huge favor to even employ her and doesn't hesitate to disparage her disability as abnormal. He also touches her inappropriately as if he is entitled to her body and basically threatens to fire her unless she goes to a Halloween party with him. Both people are infuriating in the way they interact with her.

Thana's crusade against men culminates at the office Halloween party. She dresses as a sexy nun and brings along her trusty .45. Her boss shows her off to everyone as if she's a prize he won and of course leads her to a room to be alone. Once there, she murders him and then turns her gun on every man in the party. Once she kills indiscriminately (and beforehand when it's implied she kills Mrs. Nasone's dog), it's much harder to sympathize with her. Her misanthropic feelings encompass more and more people until it's simply hard to justify. One of her fellow seamstresses stabs her in the back, ending her crusade and her life. Thana feels completely betrayed and shocked by the attack. She had always felt safe with other women and lost sight of how her actions would look to others. The ending is still tragic in that Thana only wanted to live her life in peace.

Ms. 45 is a suprisingly good film for an exploitation movie. It does a wonderful job at showing how dangerous it feels at times to be a woman and exposing a real part of our society. Zoe Tamerlis Lund portrays Thana amazingly well without every uttering a word. Her facial expressions and body language say everything. The only part I didn't enjoy was Thana supposedly killing Mrs. Nasone's dog and then having the dog come back at the end. It seemed a cheap way to get the audience to pull away from Thana and seems to absolve Mrs. Nasone of her horrible behavior. Other than that, this film is surprisingly relevant and well done.",1520467200,,6075,4.5987084870848705
