4484947,1,B004W2EQF2,"Where once there was rumpery, now there is only frumpery - has the romantic drama got too serious?

Jessica and Siobhan: the party is over in Mistresses. Photograph: BBC/Ecosse Films
""Long time,"" snapped Siobhan, stomping past Katie in a cagoule the colour of dead trees. ""I know,"" replied Katie, stiff-shouldered in an uneventful cardigan, her face a picture of misery. The message was clear: Mistresses has Gone Serious. What was once frivolous, glossy and summery is now contemplative, matte and autumnal. Where once there was rumpery, now there is only frumpery.

But weep ye not. The ingredients that made the first two series so brilliantly, stupidly addictive - the communal snarking about hopeless men over endless bottles of prosecco, the lingering shots of aspirational interiors, the frantic bums, tums and thighs workouts on designer faux-fur throws - may have been (temporarily?) replaced by more sombre concerns, but this was still an expertly crafted slab of premier soap. There were new enemies and old habits, fresh intrigues and genuinely quite exciting subplots. Meanwhile, simmering underneath it all was an inexorable sense of doom - a bubbling cauldron of disquiet that threatened to erupt, spraying the birch-veneer fittings with hot gobbets of Big Drama.

We joined the quartet two years after the events of the second series. Before we could ponder the reasons for their current estrangement (and what an estrangement - gathered reluctantly at Katie's house in rumpled leisurewear, the atmosphere between the former friends wasn't exactly happy hour at Wetherspoons), we were whisked back to six months earlier for a hearty serving of plot.

Siobhan is now a single mum nursing distinctly ambivalent feelings for the engaged-to-someone-else Dominic. Trudi's cake emporium (McGreggs) is up to its icing bag in debt, while her late-night spreadsheet sessions have incurred the frustration of thuddingly dull househusband Richard. Guilt over her treatment of Dan has forced Katie into both self-imposed singledom and a series of hitherto unthinkable cardigans. ""I am on my own because frankly I don't know who would want me any more!"" honked the locum, cableknit sleeves flapping, as her brittle mother (a splendidly crackly Joanna Lumley) gazed on, open-mouthed, across the duck-egg blue expanse of her distressed rustic kitchen.

As for Jessica, where to start? Gone are the days where the party planner's diary consisted solely of four-hour business lunches followed by a dash to the nearest boutique hotel with AN Hunk/Hunkess to play ""sexy mortar and pestle"" until the ensuing clouds of love-dust clogged up the air conditioning and she had to get room service in to clean it out with wet wipes. Instead, Jessica 2:0 now spends her time fretting about her finances with earnest husband Mark and drinking water (water!) in outdoor cafes before going all Bridges of Madison County over another negative pregnancy test (""I am trying to be brave and buoyant and, you know, JESSICA, but I just can't do it any more!""). And she's recovering from a miscarriage. It's all a bit glum.

The warp and weft of female friendship that underpins the series appears to have woven itself into a pattern of self-loathing. Everywhere you look there are signs reading ""Impending financial disaster 15 miles"" and ""This way to catastrophic romantic imbroglio"".

So, what did you make of it all? Has the Mistresses autumn/winter look added a welcome depth to the gloss? Or did you prefer it when the ladies spent their time making pigeon noises at shoes and banging their way through Bristol's seemingly inexhaustible supply of expressionless style-supplement wristwatch modELS.",1327708800,4,3754,5.274706867671692
4484948,4,B004W2EQF2,"Watched all seasons and i loved it. Im now watching the series on abc, and its a little but same plot.",1375574400,,102,3.9047619047619047
4484949,5,B004W2EQF2,"I like this series very much, and loved to see it has been improved each session. The session 3 is the best. The characters became more completed, the feelings are deeper and the story line gets better and better. The performers are more comfortable in their shoes too. This session they worked so well together, the end of it brought tears in my eyes.
I hope Amazon will have session 4 available soon!",1374624000,,402,4.52054794520548
4484950,4,B004W2EQF2,"We really enjoyed viewing the final season, but didn't think that story stood up to the 2 earlier seasons.  That said, you will enjoy this and it does put a close to the story.  Enjoy.",1374624000,,184,4.228571428571429
4484951,5,B004W2EQF2,an amazing show you won't want to miss. this season starts out with a bang and leaves you wanting more.,1373500800,,103,4.2
4484952,3,B004W2EQF2,Only 4 episodes -weaker script than before. Rather left me hanging at the end. The writers seemed to run out \of ideas as the themes got increasingly unlikely.,1372636800,,159,4.714285714285714
4484953,5,B004W2EQF2,"great show, wish it ran longer....... I hope the U.S, version can stand up to my standards set by the U.K. Version!!",1370908800,,116,4.318181818181818
4484954,4,B004W2EQF2,Great show to watch while you're doing something else like breast feeding or folding laundry or something. The characters lives are such a mess that it makes you feel great!,1368662400,,173,4.8
4484955,5,B004W2EQF2,"I love the BBC's mistresses. It's a more dramatic version of Sex and the City. Sadly the series had to end, but they did a pretty good of wrapping it up.",1367712000,,153,3.967741935483871
4484956,5,B004W2EQF2,It's a show I never expected to like but fell in love with it and all the characters. I wish it had lasted longer than 3 seasons.,1365638400,2,129,3.814814814814815
4484957,5,B004W2EQF2,"Over the years we've had lots of shows that feature four women, ""The Golden Girls"", ""Hot in Cleveland"", ""Designing Women"", but they tend to be a farce.  This show touches on real life issues of real women.  Beautifully acted, wonderful cast, hope they produce another season or a movie.",1365033600,,286,4.816326530612245
4484958,4,B004W2EQF2,Talks about real human beings crisis. All kind of women and situations as a homosexuality and infidelity are important topics in todays world.,1363478400,,142,5.217391304347826
4484959,5,B004W2EQF2,"I would advise this to anyone who likes ""Sex in the City"" type shows. Great relationships and interesting drama. I wish there were more!",1360972800,,136,4.708333333333333
4484960,5,B004W2EQF2,"I love this series and wish it was still running.  It examines life in all its modern-day complexities, but doesn't let anyone off the hook for bad behavior.",1360627200,,157,4.607142857142857
4484961,5,B004W2EQF2,I found the first season of this show on Netflix and then found seasons 2 & 3 here.  Once I started watching I couldn't stop.  I've had no sleep and been totally unproductive for the last 2 days watching episode after episode :),1348272000,,228,4.27906976744186
4484962,5,B004W2EQF2,"This is the best guilty pleasure in the WORLD. These four women have the worst, best luck you can imagine. They loose one man in an unthinkable disaster, only to find yet another tall, gorgeous dreamboat leering at them from across the street not ten minutes later. I'd want these authors writing my life for me, if it weren't for all that pre-dreamboat tragedy, which must be tough.",1346803200,,383,4.647058823529412
4484963,5,B004W2EQF2,"What a great series where the characters are four dimensional and the world they inhabit is exciting and calmly believable.  I was sorry to see the last episode because visiting their lives was highly entertaining and desirable.  Each woman in this group of four was highly different from the other and lovable and not the least bit insincere in her convictions and although the series centered around feelings, the constant up and down of each situation made the roller coaster ride of plot and storyline very enjoyable.  This series will help any person who lives through their head come to terms with the fact that feelings and heart do matter no matter how educated and logical a person likes to behave.  Recognizing that the heart cannot be neglected for very long seems to be the center of the conundrum that deals with attraction and the secret ingredient so sweetly put at the end of the series [spoiler alert] 'love chooses you.'",1338163200,2,938,4.807453416149069
4484964,5,B004W2EQF2,"I only started watching this series on Amazon Prime.  I had never heard of it before and of course, the title intrigued me - particularly since it is a BBC production.  Sometimes the watching was downright difficult, knowing that the lead characters were approaching big choices.  But it's also hard to look away.  These characters are touching and beautiful, complex and easy to relate to.  I liked these characters very much.  I'm delighted that the series was given a chance to ""wrap up"".  That way, it's a complete experience for both fans and newcomers.  The last season is extra groovy because Joanna Lumley is in the mix!

Mistresses is about four friends who journey through the fires of love, sex, and betrayal together - and, at times, painfully apart. Don't let the title fool you, though.  It's not simple to define their choices.  Each encounter explores something different, something lacking and something driving.  Having said that, avoid this if you are sensitive to the topic of adultery.  This show may not glamorize it but it does not condemn it either.  This show is not about black and white.  It plays with the grey.

Please note that there are three seasons, all of which are currently available for free on Prime.",1332115200,9,1238,4.8238095238095235
4484965,4,B004W2EQF2,I was thrilled to be able to get this as I have watched from the beginning and was not going to be able to see the last 2 episodes. There is a little trouble with streaming in spots but I intend to get the first 2 as well.,1331683200,2,222,3.6458333333333335
4484966,3,B004W2EQF2,"I've enjoyed this series. The writing has been both suspenseful and emotional.
There's no denying this season is definitely a downer. It is easy to get fed up with all the characters' hysterics and big watery eyes. However, it doesn't completely ring untrue as we see the destructive nature of doing the stupid things people do every day (marrying someone you barely know, developing unhealthy obsessions with the way you think things are SUPPOSED to be in your life rather than what they are, the havoc of having a low self worth,and the missed opportunities to build healthy relationships due to a failure to honestly communicate and self-disclose).  Creating the emotional space to self-reflect and gain ""closure"" is a concept that escapes these characters, and perhaps that's why their angst and bad choices ring more than a little true to life.",1330819200,8,849,5.0212765957446805
4484967,3,B004W2EQF2,"Unfortunately, the new season of Mistresses is dissappointing.  The girlfriends are all miserable, each one in her own way.  Trudi is juggling business and family, Jessica is failing to conceive, Katie is beating herself up for past mistakes and Siobhan is pining for Dom.  The men seem equally afflicted with Richard feeling ignored, Mark looking for a way to make a living and Dom still hung up on Siohhan.  No one is happy.  This would be a fine way to start the series if the plot lines actually had time to develop.  Since there are only four episodes everything is rushed along.  Just as things begin to get interesting between Trudi and Chris and Katie and Richard, there is a dramatic event that puts an end to all the drama.  People seem to get into relationships and out of them very quickly, leaving you to feel as if you missed a couple of episodes somewhere along the way.  I am not sure if there will be a season 4, but if there is, I hope it will be more satisfying.",1328745600,2,981,4.405555555555556
8444279,5,B004W2EQF2,Great show!!!,1434585600,,13,6.0
8444280,5,B004W2EQF2,Loved the entire Mistresses series.,1414972800,,35,6.2
8444281,5,B004W2EQF2,I watched the first two seasons a while ago and couldn't find Season 3 until now.  This show deals with the grey area we all face when it comes to relationships and friendships.  I highly recommend it for ladies who want to stay in with a glass (or a bottle) of wine and some chocolate goodies!!!,1380585600,,296,4.267857142857143
8444282,4,B004W2EQF2,Loved this show. wish they didn't fast foward so many times and cut to the end. would have loved to see more of the story unfold slowly as opposed to the rush ending. Great show. Fell inlove with some and definately out of love with one character in the end.....learned something new from this show. Great Job!,1380499200,,310,4.456140350877193
8444283,5,B004W2EQF2,"I loved the relationship the women had among each other. The show was well written and it had good story lines, sometimes I saw myself in the characters.",1379462400,,153,4.5
8444284,5,B004W2EQF2,"Once again, I'm jealous of the UK and their great programming! This is a well written series, with a great cast to back it up.",1378425600,,126,4.08
8444285,5,B004W2EQF2,"I watched the first two seasons a while ago, and when ABC created their own version of Mistresses I was excited to see how it would stack up. It doesn't. The original UK version is so much better than the US version that it is laughable. These women and the actresses who portray them come across as real women on the screen. (The US version feels imminently fake, forced, and insincere. It might be bright and flashy, but there is no chemistry between any of the characters.)
The lives of Trudy, Katie, Siobhan and Jess are full of mistakes, and laughter, and tears, and most of all friendship. I was more than pleased to watch this third, and final, season of Mistresses. It is a lovely, if at times emoional, ending to a fabulous series.",1377993600,,740,4.488888888888889
8444286,5,B004W2EQF2,I love love this series and after each episode and keep watching the next!  So happy I found these and hope to see more.,1377734400,,120,4.0
8444287,5,B004W2EQF2,So heartbreaking and happy at the same time.  BBC makes the best series.  I just wish this story could go longer...,1376956800,,115,4.428571428571429
8444288,4,B004W2EQF2,"This series was so beautifully done, I was watching it for a second time finding more gems in the portrayal of the women. The girls playing each part were so believable and the stories do captured the essence of life today. A great show",1376524800,,236,4.386363636363637
