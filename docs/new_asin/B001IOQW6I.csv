8311221,4,B001IOQW6I,"Another Switchblade Pictures release, Chain Gang Girls (2007) stars half-Japanese, half-Taiwanese actress Li Mei Chan, supported by a cast of other equally beautiful girls, as convicts within Japans toughest female penitentiary. As with most WIP films, despite the rough conditions, catfights, and torture the ladies have to endure, they always remain remarkably camera ready. If you're a fan of WIP films, particularly Asian ones, and haven't seen this one yet, add this to your list. (The synopsis/review originally posted at my website, Idol Features.)",1516320000,,555,5.619047619047619
8311222,2,B001IOQW6I,"I thought this could have been better written, and quite frankly acted. The plot was very predictable, looking like a cookie cutter copy of previous films, such as this.",1432166400,,169,4.862068965517241
8311223,3,B001IOQW6I,"It wasn't what I expected.  It is a pretty mean-spirited flic.  The Japanese film industry have really come out with some shockers in recent years I guess.  This film didn't have any redeeming qualities.  It was about the abuse of girls all the way.  I hope Japanese society is not like that.  If so, I pity the women.",1403568000,,318,4.396551724137931
8311224,2,B001IOQW6I,"Chain Gang Girls had so much potential. Hot and sexy Japanese girls being exploited in a prison. But due to a lack of a budget or a lack of imagination, we are left with a mundane girls in prison movie.",1353628800,,202,4.075
8311225,3,B001IOQW6I,"All WIP flix, no matter WHICH country produces them, have the EXACT same storyline, so why would this one be any different? Some poor babe goes to jail (whether guilty or innocent is immaterial), is subjected to various forms of abuse, torture and humiliation, there are obligatory public shower scenes and mandatory lesbian encounters, the looser/smarter ones are screwing the guards for 'special' treatment and, at some point, someone plots an escape attempt that usually goes afoul. I hate to say it, but this is why we LOVE them! They appeal to the remaining cro-magnon gene cells left in us now that we can no longer beat women over the head w/ clubs and drag them back to our caves, not without becoming part of our own chain gangs, that is... This one is a decent entry to tried and true exploitation entertainment if you`re in the mood to kick back w/ a few friends, pound a few beers and indulge in mindless drinking games when the above scenarios occur. Or have a few chuckles by your pitiful self, as I frequently do. Either way, the current crop of these flix coming out of Asia is a distinct throwback/homage  to the 'Female Prisoner Scorpion' series from the early 70`s w/ the incomparable Meiko Kaji, so if you`re into them, we`re choirmates...",1266624000,5,1259,4.6968325791855206
