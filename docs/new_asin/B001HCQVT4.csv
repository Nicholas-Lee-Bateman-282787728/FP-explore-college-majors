8308723,5,B001HCQVT4,"I really loved this film. I thought it was wonderfully written,
directed and shot. The cast of characters were crazy funny. If you're
into dark comedy's this is a must see. The plot was totally crazy but
it totally works. I was really surprised at the high level cast, for an
independent film it had a lot great actors. And the guy who stutters is
freak'in hilarious. I think this was one of the last movies with David
Carradine in it. Plus if you like Frank Harper in Lock Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels you gotta see him in this. Gina Bellman is totally hot
- and if you're into dwarfs - she is even hotter. Just check it out,
you won't be disappointed.",1274745600,,654,4.282258064516129
8308724,3,B001HCQVT4,You have to appreciate British humor to enjoy this one...just insane...a little bit of Benny Hill and sick humor...but it's a jolly good time.  David Carradine is hilarious!  The cast is excellent...3 stars for another Vanguard gem.,1268956800,,232,5.243243243243243
8308725,5,B001HCQVT4,"It is evident from start to finish how much the filmmakers and crew put towards this film, because beyond the extreme madcap adventures are characters, locations and a story I found myself constantly cheering for. This is a DVD I'll end up coming back to often, and definitely deserves its place in my Permanent Collection.",1238025600,,323,4.890909090909091
8308726,5,B001HCQVT4,"A one-day cult classic with creative quotes and references. Gives the viewer an unexpected, yet enjoyable two-hour experience.",1237939200,,126,6.055555555555555
8308727,5,B001HCQVT4,This is a great independent film with the sort of wit and dark humor that makes every viewing a terrific experience.  Brilliant direction and a wonderful cast.  I highly recommend it.,1237939200,2,183,4.870967741935484
8308728,4,B001HCQVT4,"This film has a great deal of offbeat hilarity stemming from whacky characters in often compromising situations. For a low budget indie film, this was extremely well written, directed and edited and I think it could become a cult classic.",1237939200,,238,4.975
8308729,4,B001HCQVT4,This is an impressive and talented cast of relatively unknowns who do justice to an eclectic group of dysfunctional characters. The writing makes even the most ordinary events seem fresh and hilarious. Don't miss this very funny movie. Lots of fun.,1237939200,,248,5.073170731707317
8308730,5,B001HCQVT4,"No doubt done on a small budget but a truly funny movie.  After seeing the last five minutes I had to back and view the movie a second time, the second time I saw it completely differently.  Well done.  This has the makings of a cult film.

I especially enjoyed the dialog between the director and the director of photograph in the directors comments track.",1236038400,,357,4.446153846153846
8308731,4,B001HCQVT4,"A movie that must be watched at least twice to get all the nuances.  Very enjoyable.  could be the next cult movie.  Buy it, take it home become a part of it.",1233792000,3,158,3.875
