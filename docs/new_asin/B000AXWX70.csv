2395820,4,B000AXWX70,"Sure it's nearly bereft of fanfare and staggering production values, yet Home Movies stands as one of the most endearing and clever creations ever to grace the small screen.  It's a show that never takes itself too seriously or blows itself up to Hurculean proportions, and yet manages to exhude sincerity and meaning at almost every turn.  Unlike most of the Adult Swim fodder, Home Movies actually develops coherent plots, or is at least patient enough to focus on a common theme or motif, and has a sense of humor more akin to the uneasy awkwardness of Seinfeld and Arrested Development, with characters stammering over each other and launching into embarassing (yet hillarious) tirades that go nowhere.  The kids behave like adults and the adults are inept and childish, if well-meaning.  Charming, minimalist and with a real heart, but above all wickedly funny, this is a real treasure, no matter what the price...",1131062400,34,919,4.9869281045751634

2395848,4,B000AXWX70,I like Home Movies.  It has a very rough feel to it that is intentional and adds to the whole experience.  While nothing is absolutely offensive there is a lot of subliminal adult humor so probably not for kids.,1399075200,,211,4.384615384615385

2395868,5,B000AXWX70,"Amazon is nagging me via email to rate stuff. So I'm rating this.  If I watch shows over and over and over and over and over and over... no faults found should be sufficient to tarnish the intrinsic value provided, hence 5 stars. At 2:30 in the morning, I am too busy watching TV to provide a quality review, so I applaud you moving on to better efforts by more worthy critics. Season 3 is my favorite, followed by 4, then 2, then 1.  I enjoy all of H. Jon Benjamin's work, and am happy that so much of the Home Movies gang has come together again for Bob's Burgers (which is on right now as I keyboardbabble).  Home Movies is all raw and rough edges, figuratively and literally, but this to me is part of the charm. There's so many well delivered off the cuff moments that stay with me, that these lines will burrow into my subconscious and become part of my own conversational banter.

2395876,5,B000AXWX70,"First off, I will say this is a cartoon but it is NOT for kids.  It may go over their heads, but it is not appropriate for children.

Second, this is possibly my favorite show ever.  This is one that I can watch over and over and never get tired of it.  I always notice something new among the clever jokes, conversations, and animation.

Of all four seasons made, Season Three might be the best, although it is hard to choose.

When it comes to comedy, ""Home Movies"" has it all.  It has some of what I consider ""frat guy humor,"" like you might find in ""The Hangover,"" but it also has some very witty, well-thought-out humor...subtle humor...sarcasm...hilarious commentary on everyday life.  I really can't say enough about how funny this show is, and the more you watch it, the more you love every character on it.",1381795200,,815,4.496598639455782

I orderd all four season, that is all they had, to bad, I was hoping for three more season. It has bonus feature's so that is how I found out about how they started, and how it ended. I never could have the chance to watch this show when it aired on tv. I was working all the time, and too tired to stay up. Now I don't work and one early morning it was showing, so I started to like it alot, the characters all are great, all of them. even a character that was on the show just that one time. if you like animated shows, like the simsons, futurama then you will love home movies, you will fall in love with all the actors who play the kids..it's funny, well time spent on cloudy sad days, a pick me up show.

2395904,5,B000AXWX70,"Season three and onward found Home Movies really hitting its stride.  The gags are all on, and the flow of dialogue is very tight.  The jokes are fast-paced and there isn't an episode in the set that's not worth watching.  One also sees the characters ""coming into their own"" during this season.  Jason, Melissa and Brendan all begin to show more consistent personality traits that really allow one to bond with their characters.  Honestly, one of top 5 best sitcoms ever made (cartoon or otherwise).",1152403200,3,500,4.8352941176470585
2395905,5,B000AXWX70,"The third season of Home Movies is probably my absolute favorite.  We get to hear Duane's chops, see Brendon, Jason and Melissa balloon to borderline morbid obesity, the ultimate battle of the Reinessance Fair VS. the Sci-fi Convention, McGuirk having a heart attack, and Mr. Lynch in a cat outfit acting weirder than any of the other characters had up to that point in the series.

The two episodes I could watch over and over again (This time around I picked only two because it was so diffictul to pick a third and final):

(Bad Influences)-After watching a rough cut of their latest project Melissa points out to the boys that they're slowly gaining weight.  Jason and Brendon realize that they're ""fat enablers"" and decide to end their friendship.  McGuirk gives the school nurse another go with his ""Fat Father Theory,"" but to no avail.

(Coffins and Cradles)-A Halloween episode how only Home Movies could do it.  Brendon's Dad's girlfriend is expecting, and close to birth, and Brendon, of course, is no help.  McGuirk ends up in the hospital after suffering a heart attack brought on by some hot & heavy moments with a woman from the past who just happens to arrive at his door to talk to him about her religion.  Jason gives in to the temptation of the Halloween candy and his inner ""beasts"" are let loose, only until Melissa supplies a more than sufficient amount of smacking around.",1151712000,2,1394,4.7272727272727275
2395906,5,B000AXWX70,"One of my absolute favorite shows, I had to buy this set. This season contains some of my favorite episodes and characters.  Everyone is at their best in this set and I'm glad I bought it.  They make very creative use of commmentary tracks to do letter responses, a music improve and yes even comment on the episodes.  There's a radio show segment with interviews. Really a well put together collection. The box set contains fun movie poster parodies, two per disc plus the box.

Really a fun show with timeless comedy.  Very little is topical so the show is easily watchable forever. It's all about the characters and clever plots.  I really wish there was more than four seasons.

Also, if you didn't catch it the real life Brendon Small posed in the April 2006 Playgirl with an article about his new project.  Great pictures and a funny guy",1143331200,4,843,4.573333333333333
2395907,5,B000AXWX70,"If you have ever come across a Home Movies episode, maybe at about 3 am on Comedy Central, hopefully you immediately recognized the transcendent hilarity and quickly began devoting the rest of your life to enjoying more episodes.  If that did not happen, buy the Season 3 dvd's because Brendan Small is just immensely funny and enjoyable.  The Renaissance Fair episode is unbelievable.",1142553600,,385,5.095238095238095
2395908,5,B000AXWX70,"""Home Movies"" is easily my favorite Adult Swim show, and is, in fact, far and away my favorite animated series of all time. The show centers on the lives of three kids (ages seven and eight) who make movies with a camcorder, but despite the show being about kids, it is not for kids. This is one of the funniest shows in history, and the beauty of the humor is rooted in slyness and subtlety more akin to ""Blackadder"" or ""Seinfeld"" than a typical cartoon.

One thing I love about ""Home Movies"" are the well-developed plots, with frequent subplots which eventually intersect in unexpected ways (again the analogy to ""Seinfeld"" is appropriate); season three contains some of the most entertaining plots of any of the seasons, with standouts being ""Storm Warning"" (Walter and Perry are especially good in this episode), ""Time To Pay The Price"" (which I love for all the snippets of movies the kids have made in the past), ""Renaissance"" (featuring the most hilarious premise of the season; Mr. Lynch and Coach McGuirk are at their dichotomous best); and ""Improving Your Life Through Improv"" (featuring another hysterical plot, and wonderful ""improv"" from a horrid sensitivity training seminar where McGuirk steals the show.) Truly there are no bad episodes in the season, and the characters become more well-defined than ever before.

Of all the shows Adult Swim has ever aired, ""Home Movies"" is at once the funniest, the most understated, and the most intelligent. This DVD set yields not only all the episodes from one of the very best seasons of ""Home Movies"" but also many extras such as commentary tracks, animatics, and several featurettes and interviews.

This is a great set. It is one of the very few DVD sets that I watch repeatedly and frequently, and I recommend it highly.",1142208000,,1781,4.871287128712871
2395909,5,B000AXWX70,I love this cartoon.  When I first saw it I thought it was stupid but then I watched it again and I was hooked.  I haven't even watched this dvd yet but I know it's great.  I wish the show would have been on longer but at least I have the dvds to watch.  I loved the first seasons commentary it made me laugh just as much if not more than the show so be sure to listen to that.,1141430400,2,377,3.675
2395910,5,B000AXWX70,"Back in the dorms at college, I could expect there to be a knock on my door every night at around 10:50.  It would be one of my neighbors trying to corral everyone to watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup on the lounge TV.  I think the reason why we always had to all watch it simultaneously was because that way no one could feasibly complain about the noise from all of the raucous laughter.  Anyway, I enjoyed some of it although the shows that wrung humor from random nonsense grated on my nerves after a while.  The only show that I found on Adult Swim that made me return to it outside of our nightly groupthink was Home Movies.  It was a quieter show, a more thoughtful show, the kind of show that wouldn't end an episode with a character being hacked to pieces with a chainsaw for no reason unlike all the other shows that followed it on the schedule.  Since then, I have been happily snapping up the well-produced DVD box sets, and I really must talk about the third season set which is my personal favorite.

For the uninitiated, Home Movies is about a young boy, his camera, and his unquenchable dreams (and also his friends and his harried single mother and his slovenly soccer coach).  Eight-year-old Brendon Small spends his spare time acting, directing, editing, and co-executive producing his own short films with his two school chums (It kind of makes you wonder about what you did when you were his age.  I was hitting fireflies in my backyard with a wiffleball bat, mostly).  The movies themselves, though usually ending up as subplots, are always memorable and prove to be one of the show's most defining elements.  Plus, no matter what genre of film you can think of, from Hammer House-style horror to Memento-esque twisted thrillers, you can bet that Brendon, Jason and Mellissa can cobble the props and costumes together from household products and lawn gnomes and film it for your viewing pleasure.  Rounding out the primary cast is Brendon's ersatz father-figure Coach McGuirk, the oft-described ""youth soccer coach who hates soccer and isn't all that crazy about youths"".  He's a lazy sod, he constantly dispenses bad advice and utter non-wisdom (like my review's title), and basically he should join the ranks of TV's most lovable depraved reprobates, like Bender from Futurama, Larry from Three's Company, or Dr. Troy from Nip/Tuck.

The main draw of this set, of course, is that the third season contains easily the best episodes that the show had to offer.  The premiere, Shore Leave, features extremely good animation for a show that's actually rather crudely drawn; the climactic moment that crosses references from El Mariachi and the Graduate is an absolute highlight of the series.  Renaissance, which is about a heated rivalry between a Renaissance Festival and a Sci-Fi Convention, was like a wet dream for my nerdy self (Mental Note: show this episode at my D&D game this Friday).  Guitarmageddon may have lifted the plot from the Karate Kid but it features some blistering guitar riffs from Brendon Small (The actor, not the character.  The character can't actually play worth a lick, as you'll see).  Finally, in Time to Pay the Price, the kids' trip to a minimum security prison for a Scared Straight program is totally overshadowed by a .6 second-long shot of the main cast dressed as the X-Men (McGuirk as Colossus!  Jason as Wolverine with colored pencils coming out of the back of his gloves!  Brilliant!  Plus there's a new rendition of that scene of the cover of the second slipcase!  This is the best DVD set ever!).  Alright, so I'm a little biased towards that episode, but I can say with total objectivity that the other nine shows on this set are all great too, you can trust me on that.

What's also great are the extras.  You've got commentaries on select episodes from Small and co-creator Loren Brouchard.  They may not be as thorough and involving as your average Simpsons commentary, but I thought they were each worth a listen (By the way, the commentary of Time to Pay the Price sounds like it's going to be one long jazz fusion ad lib from start to finish.  Don't worry though; they actually start talking once the second act starts).  The Decide-Your-Doom game is a cute expansion on the Renaissance show with new inspired artwork that features almost every character that's ever been on the program.  If you persevere and reach all three endings, you'll unlock Easter Eggs that you may have missed from the earlier box sets.  Last and definitely not least, we have an NPR radio interview of Loren and cast member H. Jon Benjamin.  Between Jon's ludicrous robot voice modulation machine and his tragically flawed improv acting lessons with the call-in Petey, I was pretty much rolling on the floor and laughing the whole way.

Why do I like Home Movies so much?  I think it's because it combines some of the best aspects of the most popular current animated shows.  It has the simple but distinctive animation style plus the extremely precocious kids angle of South Park, the off-the-cuff pop culture references of Family Guy, and the well-developed characters and writing of the Simpsons.  It really is a shame that the show never found its niche and lasted only four seasons (Personally, I blame the eye-straining Squigglevision and sub-par unscripted episodes of the first season on UPN).  It will be a little cathartic to pick up the final DVD box set when it comes out, especially since the final episode is one of the saddest series finales since the Ice Age killed off all of the dinosaurs on Dinosaurs.

That's why I wanted to take the time to talk about the superlative third season now.  Well, Home Movies, at least we'll always have the student's lounge.",1138492800,20,5731,4.773833671399594
2395911,5,B000AXWX70,"I should be ashamed of myself. I consider myself to be as big a fan of the Home Movies series as anyone else giving this excellent DVD set five stars here, but I did not know season three had been released. During the Christmas season my wife made doubly sure that I didn't have it before she picked it up for me. How could I not know it was out? How could I leave it off my list? She considered it a great stroke of luck and couldn't wait to see my face. She got the reaction she expected.

Season three took what could have been blandly considered an ""animated comedy"" and elevated it. Home Movies is officially a *cartoon* for grown-ups, and a damn good one! In my other reviews of previous seasons I've said this, and I think it bears repeating. We have the Adult Swim on Cartoon Network to thank for reviving this show but at the time of its first run Home Movies was the one and only show that could be considered absolutely for adults. It's just too smart for most of the fifteen-year-olds (whom Cartoon Network considers adults), which was why cancellation loomed so darkly over the program, and finally struck after season four. I have used my other reviews of Home Movies here to take a little dig at the Adult Swim Sunday and their crappy, fifteen-minute, enhancement-smoker programing, but now I can't cause I don't watch the damn block anymore, HA!

I love all the episodes but ""Shore Leave"", ""Storm Warning"", ""Renaissance"" and ""Stowaway"" sticks out as the very best. My absolute favorite is ""Guitarmageddon"", something about that weird little mama Clarice. ""I dropped an egg once. That chicken hated me, but I hated her first!""

Walter and Perry have a number of excellent scene-stealers, espcially in ""Storm Warning"", and again, the price they ask for this boxed set is excellent as well.

I have a couple of minor complaints about the DVDs this time around. Before I bitch about it though, I have to stress that this show is good no matter how you slice it, I just have some trivial issues, perhaps you could call them ""pet peeves"". First, the menu: It shouldn't bother me so much that they've used the same menu, with the same mild theme music from season one... but it does. That theme was replaced in the show with a harder rock style version in the seasons following season one. Its okay if Soup 2 Nuts is too cheap to change the menu format, it works rather well, but at least change the damn music. After two boxed sets of the same thing, I thought someone should say something.

Also, my first two reviews of these great boxed sets I make no comment about the commentaries. They don't make a difference in the overall scheme of things. I mean I buy these for the episodes and only listen to the commentaries once. However, if you're going to have commentaries, is it so hard to get Brendon Small, Jon Benjamin, and Melissa Galsky in the same room to do it? I mean are the really *that* busy? Do Brendon Small, Jon Benjamin and Melissa Galsky not like each other or something? What's the deal?

I am herby demanding that all three stars grace us with their voices on the commentary for season four! I wouldn't mind hearing from Janine Ditullio, Ron Lynch, Jonathan Katz etc. as well, but I guess that would be pushing my luck. I don't give a whit about animatics, featurettes, or music videos. Just give me all three stars on the commentary or don't bother. Cause speaking only for myself, and if you haven't figured it out yet, Loren Bouchard isn't very interesting, though I do I admire his creativity and work as the director of Home Movies, and I thank him.

It saddens me that the clock is ticking. I was so blue when I learned of Home Movies' cancellation. I look forward to season four, but I'm feeling the same sadness that they are running out of Home Movies DVDs to release. I'm hoping against hope, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed for some kind of Reunion or straight-to-DVD Home Movies specials. I doubt that it's a realistic thought, but one can hope. Thank you to Soup 2 Nuts, Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard for such a fantastic program; and thank you Amazon.com readers for taking the time to read my worthless opinion.",1137542400,6,4161,4.525265957446808
2395912,4,B000AXWX70,"This third season of Home Movies is really funny. I know that's probably the most cliche thing I could possibly say, but it's true! I think for season 3 they sort of revert back to the style of dialoug in season 1, which is the greatest! In season 2 it took me a while to get really into it, and at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but season 3 made me laugh within the first minute of the first cartoon! I wish the characters we meet in season 2 were more developed in this one, but there is some hilarious dialoug, and the ideas are very original. Why did I give this season 4 stars instead of five? Because I felt like it.

Don't read too much into that- season 3 is VERY good! Buy it or you'll have to pay the price! (Michael Kluge did a beautiful job on his review-his is way better than mine so read that one!)",1134518400,,815,4.0
