8193371,3,B000PUB5EA,"Young Miss Madhuri Pandupatti has dreams of marrying one of the famous hero actors which adorn her bedroom walls, such as, Shah Rukh Khan, Govinda or Sanjay Dutt.  Her father Havaldar Pandupatti (Rajesh Puri) wants her to marry a police Inspector as he himself is in the force.  It so happens that a man Raju, who looks like Sanjay Dutt (Rashind Khan), is placed in jail with another man, Tika Singh (Shakti Kapoor) while the new police Inspector Gauri Shankar (Anand) resembles the famous actor Govinda.  Gauri gets Raju released from jail as the two are friends and Gauri knows Raju is innocent.  Tika is also released, but continues his criminal ways by kidnapping a boy for ransom money.

Meanwhile, film producer/director Subhash Bhai (Tiku Talsania) must locate an actor to star in his latest film before he loses the backing of his financer Bala.  Subhash spots Raju in a club and offers him the lead.  Bala works for don Lion smuggling explosives by using production company vehicles.

A man who looks like Shah Rukh Khan called Faroq (Shabbir Khan), kills prostitute Shilpa and then Anita, her friend.  Special CBI officer Shakti Singh (also Shakti Kapoor) has come to the area to discover why crime rates are continuing to rise and he arrests Tika for attacking Raju.  The killer Faroq attempts to kill a third prostitute, Mona, and is apprehended by Inspector Gauri.  Unknowingly, Raju's vehicle is carrying explosives and he is arrested.  Raju and Faroq unite to break free from jail and confront don Lion.

*This film does not include the actors Sanjay Dutt, Shah Rukh Khan or Govinda, merely actors who have some resemblance to them and their mannerisms.  Om Namah Shivay Productions makes no attempt to deceive viewers as each immitator is given clear close-up shots and dialogue which establishes they are not the famous actors, but this film keeps appearing on Govinda's filmography list.  It is an okay movie for those interested in satire, but is drab in the dances, songs and storyline.  Shakti Kappor gives the only 'performance.'*",1198022400,3,2052,4.938775510204081
