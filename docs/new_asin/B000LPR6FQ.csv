2711931,4,B000LPR6FQ,"Well put together documentary (for what it is)! I agree with the last reviewer in that it focused more on the east coast / Boston scene. I also could see how people would be dissapointed in this movie. It pretty much skipped over the San Francisco scene where hardcore was huge and very important. I was hoping to see some good Farm footage, but that didn't happen. I don't think you can capture the hardcore movement of that time accurately in just 1 DVD. You don't really get to see many movies about this time in punk, mostly before and after so I am grateful to have it. There are a few out there but this is by far the best one. Well researched and executed, hopefully there will be a part 2 sometime in the not so distant future. It is also good to see these people now after not seeing them for over 20 years. Greg Ginn, Kira, H.R., Bad Brains,C.O.C, Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, SSD, Ian MacKaye, Circle Jerks etc. The Film has some great rare show footage (Henry Rollins beating up a punk that's screwing with him, funny stuff). A definite must have if you were around at that time. Someone Please make a San Francisco hardcore scene Documentary!! Check Out ""We Got The Neutron Bomb"" book. You will love it!",1172620800,,1211,4.410714285714286
2711932,2,B000LPR6FQ,"Great book, awesome topic, engaging interviews and cool live footage -- so, why was the movie so disappointing? Maybe it's because it was so disjointed and never put the various scenes in context (especially chronological context). Maybe it's because nearly every interviewee said the same thing -- all fans of hardcore punk were losers/outcasts (not true!), the scene was a reaction against the oppressive climate in the early '80s, including Fleetwood Mac, disco, ""coke snorting Hollywood types"" (these parts made me cringe -- so did the interviews with guys like Keith Morris, who reveal themselves in their old age to be inarticulate burnouts). I agree with the other posts as well -- no DKs? no Misfits? no Husker Du?. It's like Hardcore for Dummies, but since the movie never scratches below the surface and never presents the material in a coherent manner, even dummies won't be any smarter about the topic after watching it! Hopefully, someone will do it right one day.",1172534400,4,977,5.037037037037037
2711933,2,B000LPR6FQ,Too much BOSTON!!!!!and other than the straight edge nod Boston's scene didntreally amount to much. Not enough LA..not even a SINGLE DK mention???? cmon,1172275200,5,152,5.375
2711934,4,B000LPR6FQ,"Ths Misfits were not mentioned at all. At all. WTF?!? There better be a seperate Misfits movie coming out then. Even the book has a whole chapter on them. The closest you get is a couple of clips of Bobby Steele, and you see the Crimson Ghost in the background of a lot of the interviews. That's why the movie only gets 4 stars from me.

Other than that, it's a great film.",1172102400,3,373,4.109589041095891
2711935,2,B000LPR6FQ,"This documentary cames across to me as being VERY disingenuous and full of faulty reminiscence--basically, a reminder that eye witness accounts, especially in retrospect, should be taken with more than a grain of salt.

This film is a documentary of sorts about the early hardcore punk scene--post-Sex Pistols and post-Ramones, after the initial flux of punk rock.  America faced a new threat (the Reagan era), and a whole new crew of young kids had reason to feel ousted from the dream world of the institutions of the country.

And so began a nationwide network of bands who pressed their own records, drew their own album covers and played in laundromats and abandoned gas stations.  Bands who slept on the floors of apartments of other bands and knew that their time was short, because their music was all about energy and rage and throwing your fist at whatever face was nearby.  And they called themselves hardcore.  In the course of this documentary are interviews with members of Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Black Flag, The Circle Jerks, SSD, Jerry's Kids, and all kinds of punk rockers who lived and thrashed in those days.

But just like the conservative fantasy of the 'good ol' days,' when, as Reagan himself put it so appropriately, ""before there were racial problems in America,"" we know that reminiscence can lie, and even those who lived and worked in the days that are being reminisced upon can often get them wrong.  There are moments of wonderful honesty in this film about the unreserved anger and energy of the early-80s hardcore scene, both its glories and its horrors, and then there are people who just want to feel important and self-righteous, and unfortunately this film cannot distinguish between the two.

There are some moments to admire--H.R. of Bad Brains is, as always, a joy to hear, mainly because of the spirituality he infuses into music.  He discusses not so much the glory of the scene itself but he and the band's philosophy behind their actions.  Rollins and Ginn of Black Flag remain steadfastly honest about their scene and their roles in it.  Rollins especially carries the distinction of a man who knows who he is and who he has been, able to look at the drive towards violence in the scene, and report on the abuses he took from police, but also able to look back and know that it was a momentary scene, good for what it could do but also knowing that the violence could only go so far, as Ginn acknowledges as his reason for getting out.

But there is a lot that this film very much white-washes or simply ignores.  The minority (and sometimes hatred) of women, which is dealt with in an obligatory couple of minutes, kind of like watching a black man tap-dance on the white-as-hell ""Lawrence Welk Show,"" insisting that there were women in the scene, but the few provided stills conflicting with the primarily testosterone-packed live footage.

But my main issue has to do with the overtones of White Power that eventually took over the hardcore scene and had its roots in the early 80s, while in this movie those overtones dismissed by Ian MacKaye insisting that there is ""no racism"" about the Minor Threat song, ""Guilty of Being White.""  The 80s hardcore scene used White Power and Nazi references in two different ways: on one hand, you had songs like ""The Big Takeover"" by Bad Brains that used Nazi references to make political statements, to liken the conservative noose of Reagan clones to the Final Solution.

But on the other hand, you had those who simply used the hardcore scene as a way to establish White Power and turn every good idea upside-down.  And this is where the movie fails in a big way, because while I wouldn't say that Minor Threat engendered the White Power movement, there were many who made it its bastardized first step.

The problem may lie in the lack of rather distinguished names from the hardcore scene.  Though Hsker D is mentioned a couple of times, no one from the band is ever interviewed.  The same with Dead Kennedys, who clearly saw such a problem in the scene when they wrote a song like ""Nazi Punks F*** Off.""  But in the end, swastikas and KKK hoods and stormtrooper S's are carted across the screen with little sense of who was using them in what way.  It is also curious that the film wants to drop in the Beastie Boys, but never gains any access for comments--did the Beastie Boys simply have no interest in providing any reflection on the hardcore scene, or did they offer comments that didn't fit into the narrow view the filmmakers wanted to expound?  In this respect, I feel that the filmmakers wanted to portray a very predetermined vision of the hardcore years and didn't want anything to get in the way of that.

The film is also disingenuous in the way is documents the fall of the hardcore scene.  Yes, there were many bands who dropped their tempos and lamed out into 'hard rock' or metal.  But to present Bad Brains as a band that lost their edge when they started doing reggae?  Even the classic yellow ROIR cassette (which I bought at least 4 or 5 times because people kept stealing mine, since I was the only person in my town who was insane enough to buy that stuff) that they offered as a seminal hardcore album had not only reggae but a dub groove, so to try to say that Bad Brains went the way of the lame by doing reggae after being such great hardcore punks is simply false.

In the end, this film comes across as a bunch of older punks harking back on the good old days.  While some can still tell us stories of what really happened, others come across no better than fat and slow varsity letter football players who want to hold on to the myths of their past so deparately that they'll change the facts to make their stories sound plausible.  Dave Brockie puts it best in this movie when he scorns modern punk and follows that up by saying that he just might be ""old and bitter.""  Unfortunately, these filmmakers seem to think that the old and bitter have something honest to say.",1172016000,19,5994,4.609595484477893
2711936,4,B000LPR6FQ,"For a music/documentary its great.  For a movie loosely based on a book not a great.  It focused on the bands that most would expect it to, black flag, minor threat, bad brains and many lesser known bands.  The only complaint that I have about the movie is that if you actually read the book their are people/ bands that you would expect to be interviewed.  Which is why I didn't give it a 5 star.  The live footage is good and so are the interviews.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Hardcore/Punk.",1172016000,,515,4.204081632653061

2711938,5,B000LPR6FQ,"I don't own the DVD -yet- but I can tell you about the movie; I'm not that guy that reads a novel before seeing a movie. I never read A Clockwork Orange I know, I know it was sooo much better than the movie. Whatever. In this case however, I have to say that the movie fully failed the book. But how could it be any different? There was so much information in that book I could've never lived my life as a Punk and still could've claimed to. It was, even with the aforementioned fact excellent. Whatever way you can, see it. I'm not kidding you. There are so many movies about the Punk scene and none about Hardcore, which is truely ours. You can argue Punk all you want but Hardcore is fully homegrown. This movie makes you understand that. The footage, man I remember reading about the requests for footage the  thinking, they'll never find footage worth anything. They'll never get footage from bands like Negative Approach, SSD, TSOL, Millions of Dead Cops... at least nothing you haven't seen before -but they did- and it's beautiful. I felt like going out and rioting outside of the Ritz Theater (philly) after seeing some of that. Especially seeing Harley Flanagan explaining the build-up of Bad Brains ""Take Over"" and the power of the NYHC scene. I can't tell you about the flick too much, if you're anything like me, your eyes will be pinned from start to finish... especially with additional footage.",1168819200,,1410,4.573122529644269
2711943,3,B000LPR6FQ,"Any documentary that presents personanges and comments of the people who were there and/or making the music during hardcore's heyday is worth checking out...that said, what I DIDN'T LIKE about this video was they way certain people interviewed in it tried to portray hardcore,
as if it was some sort of 'focused,' or 'liberal' movement...it was *not* in the least...it was *way* more diverse and chaotic, with different factions...
Everyone's entitled to their own 'dreamworld' interpretation of it I guess, but it really was not that...
for example, the only reason most punks might say they hated Reagan was that someone else with a voice, a concert flyer, or an album cover
said that...so get over that right now. It was mostly anti-political overall if anything, just *pure chaos*, terrifying fun and energy..

2711952,4,B000LPR6FQ,"I gave this documentary 4 stars (""I like it"") instead of 3 stars (""its ok"") due to the fact that I listen to hardcore.  Simply put, for anyone who likes first wave hardcore bands, check this movie out.  Its the not the greatest documentary ever and it is kind of frustrating how they try to condense multiple stories into one feature rather than sticking with an over arching theme to address hardcore at length, but its fun to watch and you might learn a thing or two about the bands you like.

Now, for the reader who isn't a fan of hardcore, all hope is not lost; you still might find this documentary somewhat interesting and worth checking out.  But like I said already, multiple stories - and inside jokes that have to be explained - are packed into it, but it is driven by awesome interviews and does show how hardcore was THE counter culture movement of the 1980s. Plus, you may learn how these bands you never heard of had a major impact on the bands you listen to today, which is always interesting.",1422057600,,1009,4.408602150537634
2711953,5,B000LPR6FQ,"To 'truly' chronicle the hardcore punk scene would take an immense amount of time and space. This documentary does a good job. There are many upsides to this documentary, and I recommend it as mandatory for those who were never around during this period, and for those, like me, who wanted to see my youth documented. It is a wonderful trip back to a time that was magical. On the downside of things, well, the  obvious void is of 2 of the most influential and popular bands of the time, namely Dead Kennedys and The Misfits. Having the band members chronicle, if just a little bit, about their time and experience in the scene at that time would have, in my opinion, gone a long way in completing the documentary. However, the final result is, if you do or don't have the book, check out this documentary on one of the most creative, explosive, and influential part of the music(punk) scene in the history of the era of rock and roll music!

2711955,3,B000LPR6FQ,"American Hardcore is a pretty good look at 80s hardcore punk though still flawed. First of all there's too much focus on Black Flag, yah I know they were great, but there plenty of other bands that should have gotten screen time. No mention of D.R.I, Government Issue, Negative Approach or any of the other great punk bands.

The Dead Kennedy's don't even get a mention, nor do The Misfits. The New York part is fairly lacking, but then again this documentary makes to notion that only LA and Boston made hardcore, while other cites got snubbed. The book went into more detail and there were more subject's discussed, but never less it was a pretty good attempt.",1384214400,,662,4.610169491525424

2711957,3,B000LPR6FQ,"...because it's a shameless circle jerk throughout. The mystique surrounding early 80s American punk quickly becomes tiresome nostalgia as Keith Morris and other influential hardcore pioneers talk at length about what was obviously the most important part of hardcore punk: themselves. Fun for the bits of video that illustrate the history of happenings largely confined to books and word of mouth, but most people don't  really care about seeing an old-ass H.R. or hearing Henry Rollins crack another joke, or God help us Ian McKaye droning on about the authentic somesuch nonsense. Listening to a handful of albums by Black Flag, Bad Brains, the Circle Jerks, the Vandals, Minor Threat, etc. would distill more of the essence of hardcore than watching this film. It suffers too much from the Dogtown/Z Boys syndrome of ""Boy weren't we cool--just ask us."" However, some of the darker side of the scene is detailed, which you won't necessarily hear about in other accounts: the violent mooks of DC, New York and Boston who shared much in common with street gangs and redneck gay-bashers, and the head-scratching account of some guy from TSOL pissing on unconscious people because, well, F you, that's punk. I'll wrap it up thusly: hardcore fans will be mildly interested, most everyone else will be bored.",1367452800,,1305,5.069767441860465
2711958,4,B000LPR6FQ,"""American Hardcore"" is an excellent film for fans of American hardcore punk rock from the early to mid-1980's.  It begins the history of the political and cultural climate of the era when Ronald Reagan takes office as president and the country shifts far to the right.  His presidency sees a shift to return American life and culture to the conformity of the 1980's.  At the same time, there is a crippling recession going on.  Punk rock took a severe turn to the left in response to flip a finger in the face of this new age of conservative conformity.  The film covers the scenes in California, Washington, D.C., New York, and all points in between.  It includes interviews with the hardcore punk artists as well as their roadies and friends who were there when it happened.  They tell a lot of very interesting stories from that time and you really get a feel for what it was like in the American hardcore scene at that time.  Also, the film is chuck-full of footage from a ton of the bands as they performed in crappy clubs and anywhere else they could play.  Fans of American hardcore music need to buy this movie.  Its both very informative and entertaining.",1365292800,,1164,4.579710144927536

Like others have said, they did leave a lot out, however I think if they were to put in everything about East and West Coast hardcore it would have to be like a mini-series or made into 10 parts!  So relax people and just know that other punk documentaries will come out and have come out and we can't expect to see it all in an hour and forty minutes.  Besides that,  this movie might just be the perfect movie for some kid to watch that will change his life musically and do for him what Punk did for you when you were a squirt.

2711963,1,B000LPR6FQ,"Just watched ""American Hardcore"", about the American punk scene from 1980 to 1986.  It is either depressing or reassuring (haven't decided which) to realize the middle aged punks are as full of crap as the middle aged hippies were.

Of course, now - all these years later - they have well thought out reasons for the music and their involvement in it.  It seems these boys (and they were all boys then) sat down and thought out the political and social ramifications of the movement they were involved with.  It was all about politics and equality.

The highlights include Henry Rollins telling us ""...bands were starting to network.""  Network.

...Bad Brains wallowing in their greatness of yesteryear.  Like the old burnout in the bar telling anyone who'll listen what a great high school football player he was in 1981.

...Or Moby (yes, Moby) saying that punks ""...created something that's so much better than the milieu that we're being rejected by.""  Moby (yes, Moby) talking about the punk milieu.  Milieu.

I never thought of the punk scene as a hotbead of white liberal guilt.  I was wrong.

One punker (THE SON OF A UNITED STATES SENATOR) talked about how being a punk was legitimately becoming a member of a minority.  You know, like...uh, well, black people.

The real lesson of ""American Hardcore"" is that, with age, everyone (no exceptions) becomes completely and utterly full of (expletive).",1278374400,11,1406,4.919148936170213

2711965,4,B000LPR6FQ,"This documentary does a laudable job surveying the impressive landscape of 'harcore' punk rock from the late '70s to the mid '80s. It contains some rare and exciting live clips and interviews--some contemporary, most present-day, that in themselves make the documentary worth watching. The narration takes viewers from scene to scene, coast to coast, showing how different bands influenced one another and the how the overall scene exploded against the backdrop of the ultraconservative Reagan era. While many important acts (the Dead Kennedys, JFA, Reagan Youth) are omitted, the filmmakers nevertheless do an excellent job of 'coverage;' that is, they acknowledge the breath of the scene and demonstrate its varied articulations on a regional basis, which is undoubtedly the movie's overall strength. The early footage of Poison Idea, Gang Green, and Bad Brains, for me (and I suspect many people from the era) made the film invaluably entertaining.
 While the film does an excellent job discussing the origins and florescence of the hardcore scene, the interpretation of hardcore's demise suffers from a revisionist subtext that simply misrepresents the issue. Specifically, the authors downplay the role of moronic, violent, Nazi skinheads, whose fascist agenda--which largely attempted to define how punks ought to think and act--killed the 'anything goes' punk rock culture. They instead attribute punk rock's demise to the short attention span of fans and, when pressed to address the issue of violence, reference Circle One and other LA 'gangs.' Bringing attention to these largely Hispanic crews, in my opinion, is an awfully smug attempt to justify the neo-fascist skinhead violence of the era, which is barely mentioned. It's also likely, and unfortunate, that younger viewers will follow this misleading interpretation.
 To be fair, I don't believe revisionism was intended by the filmmakers. Rather, I think they simply remember things the way they present them here. In this sense, the film is a study in itself at just how difficult it is to document the largely indefinable phenomenon of punk rock. It occurred to me when watching that these bands all inadvertently contributed to punk rock's demise precisely by attempting to do what the video does: that is, to define it (thus, the phrase 'hardcore' punk rock as opposed to the traditional description). The effort to make punk rock into a standardized sound and scene invited the morons and thus killed the freethinking spirit of the original scene.
  Despite its revisionism, this film goes a long way toward capturing the energy and excitement of the hardcore scene. Anyone interested in punk rock should see this. Nevertheless, if you want to learn about punk rock, no book or film will ever replace the (not so) simple act of doing. Go start your own band.",1246147200,5,2829,5.252212389380531
2711966,3,B000LPR6FQ,"In a theater watching this movie with my band and the pile of VHS tapes (lots of Target Videos) by the TV of the band house at the time was far more in depth and informative than this flick. This is pretty much The Bad Brains/Black Flag story with other bands squeezed in here and there. If you are already into hardcore music then nothing new is presented here. It was cool however seeing all those band logos stretched wide on a massive screen. The omission of the Dead Kennedys was glaring, but maybe they were too intelligent for what this film is trying to present hardcore as.

One thing thats bothersome is that the movie claims hardcore ended in the mid-80s when it never really ended. You can't tell me that when there are thousands of hardcore bands playing today with thousands of shows all over America in basements, VFW halls, warehouses, house parties, and even ole fashioned venues. And yes its still actual hardcore. This movie is without a doubt for those who thought punk started with The Ramones and ended with The Sex Pistols and know little more. If you are ""in the %$#@"" as a vet would say this is just another slap in the face as one of the few documents of hardcore very accessible to the public (no doubt its probably shown IFC or Sundance) that cofirms then denies its existence. Its almost infuriating.

Other than that you have interviews you've heard a thousand times or haven't, SST Records still criminally under-represented by its owner, HR too cracked out to make sense and lots of VHS footage any fan has already seen clumped together in an uneven mess.

2711969,5,B000LPR6FQ,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Hardcore/dp/B000LPR6FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Hardcore</a>&nbsp;is not a definitive history of hardcore music or punk rock.  It's a documentary about a connected group of hardcore music scenes in cities across the USA.  The documentary isn't only about the music but more about the culture of hardcore and the world inside and outside of the scene.

While there are some shortcomings to American Hardcore, all of them fade away once you start making your way through the special features.  I will list both positives and negatives as I see them.  But overall I still feel this movie is an important historical work.

To me, I think the filmmakers chose select musicians based largely upon a subjective definition of ""hardcore"" as a smaller part of the punk scene.  As such, it is true that some groups were excluded.  Yet it should be noted that there are other movies on the much larger punk scene.  Legal issues surrounding certain groups also played a part in some of them being excluded.  I think the criticism about the missing or lightly covered bands, while valid, has been over-emphasized.

When you watch this movie from start to finish as a sociological documentary on the hard-core culture, you will come away with a very good feel for the many different and diverse sub-cultures within the scene.  That in and of itself is a great accomplishment.

One of the things we learn is the role of gay and minority musicians within the scene.  This helps to eliminate the misconceptions about who made this music and who it was against.  Another thing is also clear from the groups profiled in this movie: musicianship ranged from really poor to exceptional, and at the very top of that hierarchy was Bad Brains.  The larger question of who was the ""best"" group is left untouched, which has created some backlash from hardcore purists who were expecting their favorites to be highlighted.

The Cons

The documentary itself could have been better edited.  The film is made up of clips of different former hardcore scene members discussing aspects of the music and the times.  There seem to be way too many cuts from one person to the next, and they often move too quickly.  While they have their names repeatedly captioned, I found myself having to pause and rewind to catch a lot of the names.

The whole Reagan theme really seemed over-played to me.  The political aspects of hardcore definitely come through as important.  Yet it seems to be so much more than that.  I believe that hardcore would have rebelled against whoever was in power.

One thing I have not seen mentioned was the very light treatment of hardcore music within neo-nazi and other extremist groups.  It is mentioned, but a true historical context would have included the other side of the coin regarding how people of color and other groups were treated and perceived by many hardcore fans.

The Special Features

If I had to rate the documentary alone, it might have been a lower rating.  Going through the special features turned out to be the treasure trove I had been looking for.  These special features add 3 stars on their own, and if I could I would have given this 10 stars.

Of course there is a standard writer and director commentary feature that lets aspiring film students and other history junkies get some background on the movie.

There are also 6 included recordings of historic live performances, including:
1. MDC - ""Corporate Deathburger""
2. Bad Brains - ""Big Takeover""
3. SSD - ""Boiling Point""
4. Void - ""My Rules""
5. YDI - ""Enemy For Life""
6. Jerry's Kids - ""I Don't Belong""

Several other more recent performances were included from premier parties for American Hardcore, one from DOA and one from Circle Jerks.

And there is also a very nice feature about the photography of Ed Colver which is used in the movie.  The fact that these pictures were taken with a low end camera and lenses is even more amazing and totally consistent with the scene and the way this music was made.

Even the included previews were awesome, many of them about movies I've already seen and several about other music related features that I'm definitely going to see now.  Sony Pictures Classics has been doing really great work bringing specialty music movies to the market.

The real gems in these features are the deleted scenes.  This footage alone could have been used to make another movie, and most of it was good enough that it could have been included in the movie.  There is over 1 HOUR of this stuff!  Truly amazing, and thank you to the filmmakers for including this here. All movie companies should take note and start doing this.  These extra clips have tremendous historical value for anybody who needs to research this topic in the future.

Conclusion

Would it have been nice to have an entire history of all of punk rock including all of the better known bands?  Yes, but that's not what this is.  After watching this I was left with a much greater respect for Sony Pictures Classics for making this at all.  It is very difficult to invest the time and money to acquire, produce, market and distribute a movie like this.

Those who were not hardcore fans perhaps may have more to learn from watching this.  Not all hard-core fans will be pleased with the documentary, but all should appreciate this DVD version much more if they watch all the extras that are included.

If you love learning about music you have a lot to gain from watching this.

Enjoy!",1209254400,39,5542,4.829087048832272
2711970,3,B000LPR6FQ,"Good documentary, but leaving out Dead Kennedys and the Misfits is like doing a documentary on hippie culture and leaving out, I don't know, Jimi Hendrix and the Greatful Dead. I find mistakes that are this obvious really annoying. You wonder what the makers of the film were thinking. Another oddity is some bands getting as much attention as Minor Threat, or Black Flag. It's democratic giving everyone some time to tell their story and that's in the spirit of that scene, but there are some bands that were the primary influences and really got sh** going.

In anycase, AMERICAN HARDCORE serves as an incomplete and warped history, but it's an entertaining one. It is definitely still worth taking a look at if you have an interest in punk rock, for sure. I don't know how much someone with a basic familiarity with this culture will actually learn, but you'll enjoy seeing all these guys reminisce. Clearly the hardcore scene was one of the most vital and important culural movements of the last 30 years. I had to laugh at the comments made at the end about punk being dead. Tell that to some people I've known over the years! But, honestly I always had the sense that even they had to know the wave had peaked a long time ago.",1208217600,2,1232,4.574660633484163

What's great to see is the camaraderie that existed between the bands and the underground nature of their followings.
The great juxtaposition is the violence of the music, up against the endearing feelings it created between the people involved.

The scene, as these people had made it, and lived it, is dead for sure. Now, others have made ""scenes"". The punk-ska, the hardcore of the early 90's, punk of the 90's, cow-punk or Rockabilly even today. The hardcore punk scene of that day, is dead. But, there are new ""scenes"" to be had. Just as some of the interviews in the movie had discussed. The 10 to 15 year fad gap has swung around once or twice and has given us music to rock to and ways to question authority, politics, happiness, life. This movie is about ONLY the hardcore scene started by the kids of that time, not the Misfits, Motorhead, or any other band that the movie didn't interview or discuss. It is about that particular scene. Great movie, it knows when the scene started, when it died, who was ""important"" in it. A really good film.

2711996,3,B000LPR6FQ,"As someone who grew up in suburban New jersey and discovered the Dead Kennedys in 1983 at age 14, delved further into punk rock from there and found himself old enough to start hitting the shows just when the whole ""punk movement"" petered out in the mid-80's, I found a lot of intriguing material here about an era that I unfortunately just missed out on.  Many of the interviews (H.R. and Greg Ginn in particular) offer rare insight into the birth of a musical (or is it anti-musical?) revolution.  The live footage is often exciting, but also makes me wish they'd included more, and longer, live clips rather than brief excerpts.  (And why isn't there a single Black Flag song in the extras?)

The significance of lesser known punk bands like the Zero Boys who had to, in effect, create their entire scene in midwestern cities where no sort of counter-culture even existed, cannot be overlooked.  This film does a nice job of depicting the grass-roots development and diffusion of punnk rock throughout the land, as bands from different cities helped each other out in arranging shows (and providing local floors to sleep on).  ""American Hardcore"" does a nice job of documenting an underground phenomenon.

It also reveals the most obvious reason why that phenomenon, for the most part, remained underground: virtually all of these bands, even many of the more well-known ones, sound identical.  Part of punk's rallying cry was always a revolt against the formulaic, predictable sounds of mainstream rock and pop, and yet band after band, song after song, punk rock was typically nothing more than a strict 4/4, bass-snare-bass-snare (while riding the high hat) beat, a couple of power chords, and shouted vocals that are completely unintelligible.  That routine gets old after a while, but few punk bands could evolve past it.

Although it would probably be impossible to include every single important punk band in a single documentary overview, there is no conceivable reason for the omission of arguably the most important punk rock band in American history - San Francisco's Dead Kennedys.  Did Jello refuse to participate in this nostalgia trip?  Well, I have no doubt East Bay Ray would have been happy to be interviewed.  A punk documentary without the DK's is just incomprehensible.

Many other significant bands like the Germs, Suicidal Tendencies and Husker Du get nothing more than a quick name-check.  That's just not acceptable for a documentary on ""American Hardcore.""

Sure, you get a lot of magic moments: Greg Ginn referring to Henry Rollins as ""a nice guy""; Ian Mackaye's lucid, articulate recollections of the birth of Dischord records and the Washington D.C. punk movement; the truly incredible rags-to-riches story of Mugger, Black Flag's main roadie; the reminiscences of Bad Brains singer H.R., bassist Darryl Jennifer and guitarist Dr. Know; and many other interviews with scene veterans.  The director does an excellent job of juxtaposing interview snippets with live footage.  But there is so, so much missing from the story as it is told here.  Still, this is a very engaging, fast-paced 90 minutes, which stands up to repeated viewings.",1193270400,,3167,5.055769230769231
2711997,3,B000LPR6FQ,"Overall this is an interesting look into the early years of the American HC scene.

2711998,4,B000LPR6FQ,"With each generation there is a core group that feels disenfranchised from the rest, rebels without a clue dead set on believing in a different world where only they are the normal ones. They prefer not to be part of the standard norm, instead creating their own images, words and music to symbolize what it is that is unique about them selves. In the 50s there was the greaser, in the 60s there was the hippie and in the 80s there was the hardcore punk rocker. The most amazing thing is that each of these groups has turned out to end up the same way, becoming the norm and finding respect in a world that they rebelled against. AMERICAN HARDCORE takes a look at this last group.

Subtitles ""The History Of American Punk Rock 1980-1985"", the film documents the early days, the rise and the eventual fall of the icons of this musical movement. Perhaps some might not consider it musical at all seeing as how it relies little on melody and depends more on sheer volume and power. But when historians look back on the music scene, this one will take its place among the movements that while never quite becoming hugely popular, did indeed influence many acts that followed.

Through interviews with those who were on the scene when it began, with those who played in some of the biggest bands of the time, the movie begins its journey in the California punk rock scene where groups of early teens in the 14-15 age group, tired of what they consider oppressive parents and government agencies, revolt with a new music that they adapt for themselves. While the 70s let loose bands like The Ramones and the Sex Pistols, the American hardcore scene took these ideas and broke them down into a rougher, edgier sound.

Bypassing melody, the early American hardcore music relied on three chords played loudly and as fast as possible with a guttural vocal that was more grunting and yelling than singing. Played in storefronts and abandoned buildings, the music found its niche with these youngsters in search of a voice of their own.

The interviews throughout this documentary show those founding fathers of that movement today as they discuss what was happening when they began and how they were affected by one another. It covers the scene from location to location, noting how what started in one area was adapted in another part of the country and while the same, took on its own versions. The L.A. scene was not like the D.C. scene and neither was quite like what was found in the Boston area.

The film focuses on what became the legends of that time with bands like Bad Brains, SSD, YDS, DOA, Minor Threat, The Circle Jerks and perhaps the most famous (thanks in part to the charisma of lead singer Henry Rollins) Black Flag. Members of each group talk about not only what was going on where they were at but what it was that brought them where they were, how they felt at that time and how it altered their lifestyles.

In the end, to me, the most amazing thing was to see the change and to hear them discuss how they ended up. Some left bands and went on to become seriously wealthy with investments, some became authors and speakers, and others continue to play today. But just like those in the past, the controversial hip shakers of the 50s, the protestors of the 60s, this generation of rebels became the mainstream as well. They became the fathers and businessmen that their fathers were. Perhaps not selling shoes or working at an ad agency, but in their own way they became the exact thing they were rebelling against so long ago.

One thing of interest I found was the influences that these bands had on current acts. While not cited or discussed in the film, bands like Metallica and the Red Hot Chili Peppers come to mind as well as several other bands. Would these bands have become as popular as they are without the early hardcore punk music? Who knows? It's a topic not discussed in the film that could have yielded more conversations than what we have formed here. Then again, perhaps that's not what director Paul Rachman was looking for.

The movie is a fascinating study of youth gone wild finding them selves in an artistic way. If you're not a fan of this type of music, this film will not convert you into going out to find the CDs of bands heard. The music, as I said, is fast, loud and more along the lines of Johnny Weissmuller than Frank Sinatra. It has its place, but not all will include it. If you want to find out where much of today's music was based though (and no I don't mean the pop tart of the month music but the more heavy styles), then this movie will give you an insight that perhaps might not have been known. Well made, well documented and interesting, it's a slice of history not known to most. Now is the chance for music lovers and pop culture watchers to once again discover the American hardcore scene found in this film.",1191283200,,4868,4.523863636363636

2712002,3,B000LPR6FQ,"I was a kid in 1980, living in Orange County, when I saw a fellow student in high school with a Circle Jerk's ""Group Sex"" t-shirt and dyed black hair.  I continued to listen to a Led Zeppelin and Styx on my Sony Walkman and didn't give it a second thought.  Then someone turned my on to Oingo Boingo, and my journey to punk began.  It was actually Bad Religion and GBH back in 1982 that did for me.  My love of punk would continue to this day.

With that said, I was thrilled to rent this DVD.  Lots of great footage and lots of great memories.  Plenty of footage of Black Flag, arguably the greatest hardcore band ever.  But punk in 1982-1984 was more than the bands that are in the movie.  Even if they couldn't get the Dead Kennedy's to be in the film, it is inexcusable why they weren't included.  And you what about the fanzines?  Flipside was huge.  And what about the record stores that carried punk? What about Fear?  And I loved Kraut.

I'm thinking of going to gigs at the Olympic Auditorium (a friend worked for Goldenvoice) and all the other punk bands that were a part of the movement.  I guess many were English, and by definition, they couldn't be included in the film.

Maybe there were just so many bands that they couldn't all be included, but to me there is so much left out.

But with that said, I still enjoyed the movie.  It was choppy and not coherent.  It could have been five films by five different directors just thrown together.

2712014,4,B000LPR6FQ,"If you saw the IFC documentary that came out not too long ago called ""Punk: Attitude"", ""American Hardcore"" picks up where that one left off.  By around1980, traditional punk had pretty much died off, and the Hardcore movement was just starting up. ""American Hardcore"" focuses on all the bands that formed in different regions around the US as a reaction to (among other things) the incoming Reagan administration, the resurgence of bloated 70's dinosaur rock, and the emerging 80's mindless cocaine party scene.

The movie covers in a somewhat chronological fashion the rise and fall of the hardcore movement.  From the dirty beach cities of Los Angeles, to the downtown suburbs of Washington D.C., up to Boston, and germinating everywhere in between.  Since Hardcore was a regional phenomenon, the movie covers the scene from a regional point of view, addressing how each city would have it's own group of outsider kids who did not want to be part of the popular culture, and who would do anything they could to actively reject it.  This manifested itself in many forms ranging from the incredible Pettibone flyers advertising SST shows, the creation of regional labels and fanzines, to the D.C. and Boston ""straight edge"" movements.  The filmmakers interview members of bands important to the scene including Black Flag, Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, SSD Control, DOA, Minutemen, MDC, DRI, Minor Threat, Teen Idles, and so on.

Though a very thorough film, there are a few glaring omissions.  On the director's commentary track, the filmmakers say that they wanted to include Dead Kennedys and the Misfits in the interviews, but due to intense legal turmoil within both bands during the filming, neither were able to be included in the movie.  I understand this, yet at the same time I feel both of these bands deserved to have at least a minor segment due to their seminal influence on the hardcore scene.  Also, many of the Midwest bands, most notably Hsker D, get only a passing mention in this documentary.

My only other problem with this movie is that, just as in ""Punk: Attitude"" where members of bands from the first wave of punk rock say that punk died in 1981; ""American Hardcore"" ends with the aging hardcore guys saying ""Punk is dead"" or ""Punk died in 1986"".  As a person who was just coming of age in 1986 and discovering the third wave of punk beginning with the resurgence of bands like Social Distortion and Bad Religion, the aging hardcore people come across just like their predecessors: as bitter old men.

In spite of the few drawbacks, this is an incredible film for both musical and social history.  If you want to expose yourself to well rounded punk history, then I highly recommend watching ""Punk: Attitude"" (~pre-punk-1981), ""American Hardcore"" (~1981-1986), and ""Punk's Not Dead"" (~1986-present).  Additionally, do not miss the incredible documentaries ""The End of the Century"" (The Ramones), ""The Filth and the Fury"" (The Sex Pistols), ""Westway to the World"" (The Clash), ""We Jam Econo"" (The Minutemen), and ""The Future is Unwritten"" (Joe Strummer).

Hopefully they'll be on DVD by late 2007.]",1181174400,2,3238,4.957486136783734

Unfortunately, there was quite a bit of focus on some smaller less known bands, and omissions of details of the misfits, and husker du and other midwest influential bands.  However, the choppyness of this film soley comes from the amount of material it has to try and cram into about 2 hours.

2712017,1,B000LPR6FQ,"What a disappointment this film is.  Of all the cultural movements of the past fifty years, few have been more deserving of a documentary than the `80s hardcore punk scene -- particularly in light of the almost total corporate takeover of what used to be called underground music.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers took a compelling topic and turned it into a grade-school quality video zine.  ""American Hardcore"" is a cheap montage of grainy footage and semi-coherent interviews with washed-up musicians, only a few of whom (The Cro-Mags?  Give me a bloody break!) had any real influence on the scene.

This is the ultimate insider movie: those who were actually there in the early `80s can watch with mild interest and feel really old, going, ""Oh yeah, I remember those guys,"" while the rest of the audience learns almost nothing about a truly remarkable period.

And explain to me how and why the filmmakers had the gumption to make a movie about early `80s American punk and not so much as mention the Dead Kennedys?  Love or hate the Kennedys, that's a bit like filming a rock `n Roll documentary and leaving out the Beatles.  For that matter, where are the Misfits?  Where is Husker Du -- the first hardcore band to earn legitimate crossover cred, and whose monumental discography personifies the era's astonishingly successful do-it-yourself ethic?

Insult to injury, the editing is terrible.  The rapid-fire segments are disorienting and tedious. And for what?  What do we learn?  Just because some halfwit (Vic Bondi, shut up!) was generous enough to give you a few quotes doesn't mean they HAD TO BE in the movie.  There are too many people talking, and most of them have little to say.

The heck with this.  Go buy yourself a copy of the first SCREAM album (or better, a copy of ""Zen Arcade"") instead.",1178841600,19,1809,4.824675324675325
2712018,3,B000LPR6FQ,"American Hardcore (Paul Rachman, 2006)

Ever since I heard Steven Blush was adapting his book for the screen, I held my breath in the hopes that someone, somewhere, would get the brilliant idea to try and get the members of Husker Du together in a room somewhere, and then film the resulting chaos. Unfortunately, this did not occur (and the members of Bad Brains, Cro-Mags, and other bands with fabled acrimony involved with their break-ups are interviewed separately), but American Hardcore is still a pretty fun movie if you were there. And maybe even if you weren't, though some younger music fans are likely to take offense at the (dead accurate) assertions of some of the interviewees here that we haven't seen a real punk band since about the last Tuesday of never.

And, honestly, that's the problem. Not with the movie, or the book upon which it is based; they're great. Rachman (Four Dogs Playing Poker) combines present-day interviews with archive footage of performances and takes the Errol Morris approach (stay out of the picture and let the subjects ramble on as they please). It's a great trip down memory lane for those of us who were there. But those who weren't? Why will they care? Short answer: except for that rare kid (and I'd assume they get rarer with each passing year) who stumbles upon a Dead Kennedys or Black Flag tape for the first time and is transported the way we were... they won't.

Music, it seems to me, is the most difficult of documentary subjects to make a film about which anyone not involved with the genre is going to care. Be honest: if you're not a jazz fan, did you watch Ken Burns' epic? Did anyone who wasn't a metalhead or a TV preacher watch The Decline and Fall of Western Civilization, Part II? Of course not. I think American Hardcore will have a similarly vertical audience, though if you're a youngster who's always wondered what's missing from the current crop of ""punk"" bands, you'll find your answer here as well.

I just wish someone would do a more in-depth and definitive document of hardcore's early years. This one gets the job done, but it could be done so much better. As I said, a lot of things were left out and overall, the interviews are kind of choppy, but they did still get some great interviews.

All in all, I'd still say it's a decent introduction to hardcore (especially for people who don't already know anything) and it's worth having in your DVD collection to show people, etc. After all, it is a pretty compelling story.",1176768000,,840,4.483660130718954
2712021,3,B000LPR6FQ,"i was once having this really cool dream that there were these two really cool hardcore punk bands from the same time called the Misfits and the Dead Kennedys.  Boy were these guys cool.  wait a minute, those bands were real,i wasn't dreaming! hmmm...wonder why they weren't in this dvd?  they were from the united states, just like pretty much all of the other bands (i know, i know D.O.A. is from vancouver, so am i, chill).  and they were punk just like all of the other bands.  hell, i bet they were friends with the other bands. soooo....where are they? hmmmmm  HMMMMMM

but, now because of this movie, i have a better understanding of the War on Errorism by NOFX.  he mentioned some things on that album, that before seeing this movie, i had no idea what he was talking about.  ""Sorry Fat Mike, but what's Oki Dog's?  and This is Boston, not LA?"" but now i get it.",1176681600,,870,4.38125
2712022,4,B000LPR6FQ,"i've been a part of the punk and harcore scene for 15 years now. this documentary is just what every newcommer needs to see. its a great door into what started it all. i highly recommend this to anyone intersted in understanding where your favorite band came from. my only negative thought is that the movie ends abruptly. after 1985 there were a few more inmportant hardcore bands but they are not mentioned i don't believe the scene just ""died off"". this movie obviously focuses on the history of hardcore but it would have been nice to see how some of the second generation bands came about. overall, i loved it!",1176076800,,615,4.54954954954955
2712042,4,B000LPR6FQ,"I thought it was a pretty apt, documentary style piece about this scene. This period in American music was extremely important to alot of people, myself included. And, I think it definately shaped how punk and metal became in this day and age. Great interviews, awesome, raw live footage, and some cool bonus features make this a must have for anyone who gave a damn about hardcore from 1980-85/86!!!!!",1174780800,,402,4.840579710144928
2712043,2,B000LPR6FQ,"I was kinda disapointed by this film.

Hardcore and punk can sometimes represent what is beatiful and what life should be about. But this film is just sad. To see these musicians talk about how many people they fought and how much cooler they were than the rest is not punk at all. Punk is freedom and what hardcore became is prison. The conformity they tried to escape is what they became in the end.",1174348800,5,401,4.346666666666667
2712044,3,B000LPR6FQ,"Hardcore music, true hardcore music that is, often gets confused with pointless screaming and thrashing with little to know message or method behind it.  For those who are unfamiliar to the sub-genre that achieved it's maximum popularity during the 80's, American Hardcore is a documentary worth seeing.  Covering many, but not all, of the influential bands that arose in the early to mid-80's, American Hardcore features old performance footage and interviews with Henry Rollins and Greg Ginn of the legendary Black Flag, Minor Threat mastermind Ian MacKaye, and members of other acts including the Bad Brains, Corrosion of Conformity (yes, they were considered hardcore at one time), and the Circle Jerks to boot.  While American Hardcore is definitely worth seeing for hardcore music fans, there are some glaring omissions that will make hardcore enthusiasts scratch their heads.  The highly influential Dead Kennedys and the Misfits are completely ignored, which isn't just a shame, it's a crime.  Not to mention that there are brief discussions of the Suicidal Tendencies and Husker Du; but neither gets the detail they deserve.  There are some nice extras included on the DVD though, which is a welcome surprise at least.  All in all, American Hardcore does a serviceable and interesting job spotlighting an often dismissed brand of music, but it's hardly as comprehensive as one could hope.",1174262400,14,1397,5.2657657657657655
2712045,1,B000LPR6FQ,They left out way to much!! I mean they kept going in circles with the same bands over and over again. Plus they don't mention alot of bands that had a big influence in the scene back in the day. Could have been way better.,1173916800,5,223,3.977777777777778
2712046,3,B000LPR6FQ,"This documentary tackled an awful lot, and would have been better off as a longer series.  Too bad the subject matter is too intense for Ken Burns- I could have watched another 10 hours of this stuff, especially if it was organized better than American Hardcore's presentation.  Although the film gave a rough chronologic and geographic guide (repeated use of a US map showing band logos over their city of origin was helpful), the production was hurried, and the editing minimal; everything seemed aimed at cramming as much interview and performance footage as possible into 100 minutes.

A big problem with American Hardcore's over-inclusiveness is that no one was presented as seminal to the hardcore movement.  Everyone was glommed together, and to the uninformed, no band made a bigger splash than any other.  Were the musicians interviewed for this movie ALL that big, or were some merely more available than others?  The Dead Kennedys weren't featured at all, and to my mind, Black Flag and Minor Threat were given equal footing with Flipper, Gang Green, The Cro-Mags, D.O.A., The Necros, and The Zero Boys.

As viewers are reminded throughout the documentary, hardcore music was a fantastic, organic, filthy, DIY, aggressive reaction against the Framptons and Fleetwood Macs of the world.  However, it, too, was a scene, albeit a purer one with fewer materialistic aims.  The music was formulaic and not all that listenable, with a few exceptions like Bad Brains, and the artists almost to a person took themselves too seriously (Keith Morris of Circle Jerks is particularly bad in the film's interviews).  Hardcore was an anti-movement more than anything else, and few of the musician's ideals were borne of much more than a conspicuous wish to buck trends (hate your parents, hate Ron Reagan, keep your hair short and your clothes black... ho hum).

A great interview clip from Mike Dean of Corrosion of Conformity in the extras (all which are excellent, and there's a ton of them) hits the nail on the head: a lot of hardcore involved conforming to the ideals and behaviors of non-conformity.",1173916800,10,2103,5.014367816091954
2712047,1,B000LPR6FQ,"The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended.",1173484800,15,797,4.867647058823529
2712048,2,B000LPR6FQ,"Two-star rating for the live footage alone.  Waaaaay too many douchebags are interviewed.  Idiots/burnouts like Bruce Loose, Springa, Vinnie Stigma and Jimmy Gestapo make me embarrassed to be a fan of independent music in general.  Jack Grisham is the biggest offender (""huh-huh, I'm cool and edgy because I pissed on a passed-out girl"").  That's not a fault of the film though, as these people were idiots back then too, so it is historically accurate.  I can't believe the short-shrift that the midwest got--some of the best bands came from that region.  Oh well.  Rent it for the footage.  Oh, and HR looks really old.",1173312000,2,621,4.903846153846154
2712049,3,B000LPR6FQ,"Alot of people are calling this out because its not a 100% accurate, the chronological order, certain cities are focused on more, etc..  While I have a few qualms like: no Dead Kennedy's, the notion that hardcore ""died"" in 86, ignoring some key topics, etc..  However the film was as advertised; a persons viewpoint on the hardcore scene in the 80s.  Since this era of music is virtually ignored, its great to have something covering it.  Its impossible to cover everything in one film, so it generalized alot of things.  However there is some cool footage and interviews and I wouldnt be surprised if a part 2 came out in the future.

ps, ""too much boston""???  bah!  Boston's role in HC these days is overlooked greatly, im glad it was included.",1173225600,2,746,4.641221374045801
2712050,2,B000LPR6FQ,"Fortunately I rented this from Neflix and did not buy it.  I would not recommend that anyone who knows anything about or has any interest in American Hardcore buy this CD.  First, it is impossible to document the history of this genre of American music without mentioning and focusing somewhat on the Dead Kennedys.  DK was as important, if not more important, than Black Flag.  This is a mess and should be avoided.",1172966400,4,416,4.657534246575342
2712051,2,B000LPR6FQ,"I agree 100% with reviews below that say this movie is basically just a disjointed collection of clips.  Not having anything about bands like The Misfits and Dead Kennedys (to name 2) in this movie is a disgrace.  And as a Canadian I take offense to the fact that they use Joey Keithley as a source for a lot of interview material, with no mention that DOA were a Canadian band.  Not part of the American Hardcore scene at all.  The movie is really just a disapointment.",1172966400,3,470,4.367816091954023
