8466469,5,B005DA16FA,"I am a huge fan of John Woo films and even though this is obviously a propaganda
film, it is no less a great film.  I enjoy buying Asian films from Amazon because I am
able to buy what I want. This is an all star cast who shined.  I advise anyone who
loves Woo as much as I do, buy it.",1393891200,,285,3.5806451612903225
8466470,4,B005DA16FA,This complicated era of Chinese history is hinted at in this story.  I sense some extra dramatics that spoils the film a little bit for me.  Nonetheless it makes me hope that similar films come out that might center on the roles of a specific historical figure played in this era.,1391299200,,280,4.470588235294118

8466472,3,B005DA16FA,"I was really looking forward to this film, but it was a disappointment.  I almost gave it a two star rating , but that inclination was probably the result of dashed expectations.  Three stars is only a little generous, so the reader could probably find my true sentiments somwhere in-between.

With a host of great Chinese stars, I imagined this film would be a great epic production with beautiful scenes and a driving plot. Sorry to say it, but this film truly missed the mark.  Though the visuals were great, the film played like a string of commercials, very choppy and somewhat disconnected.  Rather than focusing on main themes, the plot presents the years leading up to the Chinese Revolution as a series of small and large events with both major leaders and secondary figures getting their due notice.  The result is a movie filled with sound bites of history, a story line of vignetts.  The great actors in the film are forced to develop their characters with only a few lines and looks, and the viewer is unable to develop any empathy or connection with them or the events that are unfolding around them.  The film never really seems to have a climax or main turning point. Though the May Fourth Movement gets a lot of screen time, it is not clear that the student revolt was the catalyst forming the communist party.  When the party is formed, the scene is a half-lit room with tears and song and pales in dynamics when surrounded by assasinations, battles, and student revolts.  This film simply lacks good story-telling.

The most memorable parts of the movie involve the characters Ku Hung-ming, Mao Tse-tung, and Pu Yi.  Ku Hung-ming probably gets the best line in the film.  He is a scholar with clear ""old school"" beliefs, and he dresses and acts the part.  At a school assembly, he ascends the staqe to receive his academic assignment dressed in traditional Chinese apparel with a pigtail down his back.  The students largely dressed in more western style clothing all find a laugh at his appearance.  Ku addresses their reaction with the line ""I wear my pigtail at the back of my head, those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.""  A skilled, insightful, and polite retort.  The scene with Mao is toward the end of the movie when he is addressing a worker's meeting.  Mao deconstructs the Chinese symbol for ""worker"" as a combination of ""man"" and ""heaven.""  He declares to the workers their value in the future.  It is a moving moment giving the common man diginity and prominence.  Pu Yi, the child emporer, makes an appearance in the film with clear borrowings from Bernado Bertolucci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Emperor-Director-s-Cut/dp/6305261032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Emperor - Director's Cut</a>, a movie I warmly recommend.  However, it is a far less flattering portrayal than given by Bertolucci and would almost be comedic if not for a stong element of the pathetic.

Given the price of the film, I was expecting a few extras.  There were none.  Certainly some extra material with historical background wouldn't have hurt.  I can't really recommend the film.  However, if you are fond of Chinese history and with little else to do on a Saturday night, you could fill your time watching this.",1329609600,4,3295,4.95264116575592
8466473,5,B005DA16FA,"The film is shot wonderfully. Every scene is a feast for the eyes. The soundtrack goes well with the action and down scenes. Very historically accurate, although not knowing all the main players of the period can be tough to follow, but I loved it anyway. I could watch this without subtitles and still enjoy it. 5 Stars across the board, totally recommended.",1327276800,3,359,4.714285714285714
