8667378,4,B00LOCL9JY,"OK late 60's to early 70's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) wrestling women vs. a monster film.  A mad scientist creates a killer robot, for no particular sane reason, to do in some wrestling femmes.  The usual dumb wrestling scenes with our gals, interspersed with our mad doc doing his mad doc stuff.  Certainly not great movie-making but an OK time-passer.  The DVD is good but not perfect quality, the color and picture is very good, but my purchase had a glitch where the picture froze but the verbal action continued.  It did not last long and it may only be on my particular disc.  The movie is not wonderful enough for me to re-buy it.  Still, recommended for fans of this genre.",1437264000,2,712,4.693548387096774
