8091097,2,B000BQL782,"before writing a bad review for the person who sold me the set I bought, I started reading these comments.  I too have wasted money on this disk.  As a fan of Stargate Atlantis, I so much wanted episode 20 ""The Lost City"".  Absolutely unplayable on disk five!!  I put it in 3 different machines at my house.  Nothing but flickering and scratching noises.  I bought the 5 disk set from a very reputable seller, but am now scared to buy a single disk with all the problems everyone else has had.  I have wasted my money, and still don't have my favorite episode!!",1449878400,,561,4.336538461538462
8091098,2,B000BQL782,"We ordered this particular season and volume because the one we had borrowed from my sister we thought had been damaged and wanted to replace it.  It is ""damaged"" in the exact same two places as the one from my sister.  Episode 18 and 21 are all scattered, distorted, freeze or blank.  Like it was not done right at the time of making the CD.  The same, identical flaw was in the one we had borrowed and she had bought it years ago.  Very disappointing..MGM is responsible for this lack of quality and not the person who sent it via you.  thank you.",1288828800,3,549,4.281553398058253
8091099,2,B000BQL782,"While I really enjoy the Stargate SG-1 series I had a bad disc with the set that I originally purchased. The last two Episodes were not playable. Episode 20 played part way before locking up my DVD player and Episode 21 would not play at all.
I was delighted to be able to find a replacement for SG-1 Season 7 Volume 5 in hopes that I would not have the same problem. However, the disc had the same problem as my original disc. The last two episodes were unplayable. So I'm out the money.
If there is any form of restitution that would be great. I'd really like a copy that is not ruined of ""Stargate SG-1: Season 7 Volume 5.",1266624000,4,625,4.1735537190082646
