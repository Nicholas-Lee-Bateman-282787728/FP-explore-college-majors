297073,3,630027182X,"""Prince of the City"" (1981) stars Treat Williams as Daniel Ciello, a corrupt NYC cop who heads the narcotics division.  Ciello and his crew routinely confiscate narcotics from various drug dealers to sell for a profit.  They also funnel some of the drugs to their junkie informants.  The cops in the division are like an extended family, and they've built very comfortable lives for themselves.  One night, Ciello finds himself cruising the streets looking for drugs for one of his snitches.  After beating up a small-time dealer, Ciello has an epiphany about how corrupt he's become; so, he sets up a meeting with the head of an internal investigation.  He provides evidence against a number of cops and does additional undercover work to help nail some others.

Directed by Sidney Lumet and based on a true story, ""Prince of the City"" is quite good in many ways.  It has a fairly realistic tone, somewhere between the grittiness of Lumet's classic 1970s cop films (Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) and the more polished NYC cop stories we've become accustomed to on TV (Law and Order).  Many scenes take place in small NYC neighborhoods - the movie just has a nice feel to it.  The acting is also good, with some terrific character actors filling in key roles, particularly Jerry Orbach.  The story is also inherently interesting, with a nicely written script which was Oscar nominated.  I especially liked the manner in which Treat Williams character is the protagonist but also so morally ambiguous.

Despite all of these strengths, ""Prince of the City"" ends up being a somewhat middling movie.  Why?  Overlength.  At 167 minutes, the film could have easily had an hour trimmed.  Too many details are presented, which ends up confusing the plot and dulling the impact of the story.  Clearly, Lumet intended the film to be epic in nature, but it doesn't have the gavitas to sustain such a long running time.  Also, the movie shows surprisingly little about how this situation affects Ciello's family; they move several times and are under constant police protection, but aside from a few scenes with his wife (Lindsay Crouse), this subplot is virtually ignored.  I really wanted to like this film much more than I did.  Nevertheless, it's not without merit and fans of cop dramas will likely enjoy it.  Just be prepared for some slow sections.",1136592000,12,2341,4.888324873096447
297074,5,630027182X,"When a cop assumes the investigation about certain nasty procedures, he finds absolutely alone with is findings, becoming the people's enemy. Perhaps the script was overloaded and the running time of 167 min. can make you get tired due many involved issues.

I still remind in the interview's James Lipton (Inside the actor's studio) When Sidney Lumet stated the lenses he employed was another actor in the film, altering the reality making the things look like totally deformed; to accent the rarefied atmosphere and remarking the rottenness.

Towering performance of Williams.

297075,5,630027182X,One of the 10 best movies EVER. I simply cannot understand why this movie gets so little attention. It combines the best of The Godfather and Seprico. Totally intense,1121212800,6,166,4.758620689655173
297076,5,630027182X,"Some spoilers within; do not read if trying not to find out plot developments.

This is a film that was inexcusably blown off at the Oscars.  It richly deserved the awards it never received.  Lifted straight from the book with only minor name changes, Prince of the City was a compelling look into the world of a narcotics detective as he brings about his unit's downfall.  Danny Cielo (Treat Williams) is the cop who belatedly develops a conscience and rebels against what he and his men have become in their war on drugs; they've corrupted themselves to nail the corrupt and maintain their fantastically high arrest and conviction rate.

At first, Cielo has no intention of turning in his unit.  He actually tries only to go after the criminals.  However, in making a deal with the feds he's made a deal with the devil.  The prosecutors realize they have a gold mine in Cielo and dig into him for all the information they can obtain.  Little by little, the circle tightens like a noose around Cielo until he ends up fingering his mentor, then his own men.  For a cop to rat on fellow cops is a deeply imprinted anamoly, an affront to the brotherhood that binds the police more tightly than blood ties.  Cielo disintegrates under the pressure and agonies of his betrayals, shaking and crying, popping Valium to alleviate his tortured guilt.  Around him, his men rat each other out and one even commits suicide.  Only one is strong enough to withstand the feds:  Gus Levy (Jerry Orbach), who marches into the office of a weasely prosecutor to tip his desk onto him and offers to toss him through the window of his high-rise building.  At the end, Levy despises Cielo for his decision, and though Danny has done the right thing in the eyes of the law, he suffers as a pariah in the view of some of his fellow police officers.

This is a great piece of cinema.  The direction is tight, the acting fantastic, and the dialogue heavily laced with coarse language that deepens the realism.  Treat Williams never again received a role or acted so well as he did in this film.  Jerry Orbach was so immersed in his part that Dick Wolf wanted him as a detective on Law & Order after seeing him portray Gus Levy.  Sidney Lumet sculpted this movie into an intense drama that, while long, is never boring.  Done by Lumet as an apology for his hatchet job on the NYPD in Serpico, this film succeeds in more ways than mere atonement; it is brilliant in its own right and ends more ambiguously, letting the viewer sort out who did the right thing.  This is an excellent movie, highly recommended for those who enjoy tough moral dilemmas and superb cinema craftsmanship.",1110931200,60,2653,4.576271186440678
297077,5,630027182X,"Simple words, but a powerful mantra that defines the most under appreciated epic of the 1980's.  PRINCE OF THE CITY may have been a bigger commercial success had it been hyped as a sequel to SERPICO, but this Sidney Lumet gem is at best a peripheral tale of 1970's police corruption in the NYPD, uniquely told from a cop in pain's point of view.  PRINCE rightfully stands on its own in all catagories and is a thinkers' film.  Treat Williams, Jerry Orbach, Bob Balaban and a host of Lumet Players deliver in undisputed excellence.  Another one that needs to go to DVD.",1102204800,4,568,4.53921568627451

I guess this one gets a little less credit than some of the others and so I'm drawn to it. It's unbelievable how quickly I was totally entranced by this film. Treat Williams is never better than right here. It's as interesting a film to me as Oliver Stone's JFK and I think I like it a little more than that film.  I just have to demand that you watch-as soon as you can. It's long, but well worth the trip and much more involving than any police drama I've seen in many years. Please, please watch it-or buy it!!!",999388800,3,669,4.186046511627907
297080,5,630027182X,"There once was a kingdom ruled over by a fair and righteous king. One day, an evil witch descended upon the well from which the people drank, and poisoned the water. The very next day everyone but the righteous king drank the poisoned water. And they all went insane. All but the king that is. For several days after, the people wondered aloud, ""What happened to our king,"" they shouted in the streets, ""Has he gone insane?"" So the king went and drank from the poisoned water, and everything was well again.
  That is the story Al Pacino's girlfriend tells him late in ""Serpico"", Sidney Lumet's celebrated 1973 true-life tale about police corruption and one's man's obstinate stand against it. Apart from Pacino's performance as Frank Serpico, that film was a compromised moral drama, thrown haphazardly together to fit a commercial running time. The success of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975) and ""Network"" (1976) then allowed Lumet to make Prince of The City, unquestionably his greatest work, and worthy of the story of the king. As a piece of narrative it ignores all the established rules: There are no acts (first, second or third). There are no heroes, and no villains. There are no gun battles or showdowns. This, for its entire three hour running time, is an account of a cop who decides to blow the whistle on corruption, and the legal repercussions that ensue. Unlike Serpico, Det. Daniel Ciello (Treat Williams) is no saint. He does what, in his view, needs to be done. And given the nature of power, a lot more. On his own accord, he heads to the Chase commission, where he decides to ""do the right thing"", and confess. His one condition? He won't rat on his partners. He knows them to be good men. We see them at his luxurious two-story house. They are cordial, pleasant, brotherly. When he states his condition to the government lawyers, he says, ""I sleep with my wife. But I live with my partners.""
  Except the forces that be don't see things the way he does. Ciello and his partners are the Special Investigative Unit for Narcotics, the ""Princes of the city"". They have citywide jurisdiction and are virtually unsupervised. When they make a bust they A) Keep the drug dealer's money. B) Sell the drug dealer his freedom. Or C) Arrest him and take his money. They have reasons too. You see, a drug dealer without money would never be able to buy another cop, a DA or a judge. And if they don't have enough evidence to convict anyway, they may as well have the money. This group of cops, as they have no doubt explained to themselves, tens if not hundreds of times, have a moral right to scam the dealers. They have a moral imperative to keep their junkie stoolies (snitches) supplied with Heroin. Yes they do this for the information, but also because, ""a junkie will break your heart."" The practice of giving Heroin, according to the government lawyers, is exactly the same as dealing. Legally, they are as culpable as drug dealers. And the moral haze thickens.
  No one joins the police force to become a bad guy. That is why Lumet, whose films are basically about the subjectivity of right and wrong, is fascinated with cops. They are not gangsters, who, as depicted in Scorsese's Goodfellas, are more about the money and ""the life"" than a mythical code of honor. For cops (even those who beat protestors or torture prisoners around the world) there has been, in most cases, a point where they justified their actions. In Prince of The City, Lumet affords all his characters, including the tens of government lawyers, an unfeigned authenticity that makes every scene in the film riveting. For every odious act performed against, or by a cop (or even a lawyer), there's an underlying moral position. The moral complexity of Lumet's best work lies in the assumption that pure evil does not exist.
  What sets Prince of the City apart (and what earns it comparisons to the films of Martin Scorsese) is the unusual strength of its characters. Lumet, who co-wrote the screenplay, something he does not do often, employs a strangely effective technique. Instead of a narration, there are regular grim stills of the ID Cards of the characters involved accompanied by quotations such as ""nobody cares about you but your partners"", and ""I'll be telling lies for the rest of my life"". The whole film then takes a feel of a postmortem documentary. The stills are there because the characters involved, probably for calamitous reasons, need to be identified. The quotations are the leads character's regrets. And as Ciello, Treat Williams gives a forceful performance that requires him to be in every scene. His character's quest for absolution closely resembles that of Charlie in Scorsese's Mean Streets. Why did this successful ""Prince of the City"" decide to voluntarily confess his trespasses, throwing all his riches away? Maybe the sight of starved junkie, shivering in abandoned warehouse, begging him for drugs didn't seem like much of a kingdom.",991526400,41,4957,4.8030480656506445
297081,5,630027182X,"This is where ""Hill Street"", ""Homicide"" and ""NYPD Blue"" got their start.  Anyone who liked any of those will love this film.
Sidney Lumet crucified the NYPD in his earlier critically acclaimed ""Serpico"".  Allegedly, he took on this work to somehow atone for giving the police such a bad time.  Here, we see how corrpution begins almost imperceptably (as one sympathetic prosecutor notes).  Getting back from the bad guys, however, must be done in one great leap, as the protagonist so tragically shows us.
This film is based on the true story of a former NYPD detective, turned into a book by Robert Daley.  It is terrifically cast, with Treat Williams creating a role of real-life Detective Robert Leuci.  Backing him are Jerry Orbach as his partner, the quintessential New York cop.  James Tolkan is the weasel of a prosecutor (who gets his come-uppance from Orbach), and Ron Karabatsos as the  worst of the no-goodniks, Sal DiBennedetto.
Get past the profanity and don't let the inevitable conclusion  of the attempted atonement be a downer.  It is spell-binding.",981590400,5,1066,4.971751412429379

Eventually, it turns into a really interesting depiction of the justice system. It raises interesting questions about whether the quest for convictions among prosecutors and the justice system in general takes on a life of its own that is indifferent to the lives it is supposedly administering justice for.

Watch what happens when people with power have a meeting with their own conscience and start to question their own existence. Then watch the people around them make it harder to investigate further. Only someone who is committed to finishing what they started can set the high bar for the next fellow. This movie does that. Cops are powerful and their journeys take them to the edge.

297638,5,630027182X,"A recurrent feature in Lumet's work has been policing and police corruption. This film is powerful addition to that ouvre.

The film is set at the same time as the French Connection and indeed it focusses on the same unit depicted in that film. However where Friedkin, the director of The French Connection, focussed on car chases and glorifying police power and summary executions this movie deals with the uncomfortable fact that the unit was one of the most corrupt in NYPD history.

And yet, the film avoids caractures and simple explanations. The cops are still decent and likable people despite their excesses and hence the difficulty of the central character's decision to expose them is never shirked. Justice when it comes is a sad thing with no fanfare and often with tragic consequences.

In some respects this film might be seen as a precursor to ""The Wire"", where tension and entertainment are derived from the dilemmas of the characters and the painstaking detail of the investigation and the subsequent court cases rather than from action set pieces.

297700,5,630027182X,"This is one of my favorite movies, right up there with The Godfather & The Godfather II.  As others have mentioned it is almost 3 hours long which requires undivided attention from viewers because of the number of characters & the plot.

I remember seeing this movie as a tween & then and now am always riveted by the performance of Treat Williams as the conflicted young detective, Daniel Ciello.  As the youngest member of a rogue plain clothed detective unit, Ciello becomes troubled by the acts of corruption he has participated in with the group and once called in to talk with investigators of the Chase Commission he can no longer deal with his conflicted feelings between what he ""should"" be doing as a cop vs what he was actually doing and so begins to out corrupt lawyers, bail bondsmen, etc.  He vows not to bring down other cops or his partners.

Although Ciello doesn't intend to get himself or his partners ""caught up"" in the investigation (initially admitting to only having committed 3 illegal acts), the relentless pursuit of corruption within the entire system ultimately forces him to reveal his deeds & betray his partners.  This confession ultimately causes his rabbi & a partner to commit suicide and causes the death of his mobbed up cousin.

Treat Williams portrayal of at first a swaggering cop to a broken, guilt-ridden man is riveting.  Other actors who stood out to me are of course, the always wonderful - Jerry Orbach as Gus Levy one of Ciello's partners; Lane Smith as Tug, one of the FBI agents assigned to protect Ciello & his family and Carmine Caridi as the doomed Gino Mascone.  I was surprised to discover that Treat Williams nor Jerry Orbach were nominated for oscars.

297701,3,630027182X,"""Prince of the City,"" (1981), is a dramatic thriller that is actually set in the 1970s in New York City.  It's based on a non-fiction book by former New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Daley, and tells the tale of the Knapp Commission, headed up by Judge Whitman Knapp, that was investigating police corruption at the time, and of Detective Bob Leucci (called Dan Ciello in the movie), whose conscience eventually forced him to cooperate with it.  The Daley book was adapted for the screen by Sidney Lumet, always a great director of New York City-based stories, working with his frequent collaborator, Jay Presson Allen; Lumet also directed, some say as an apology to the NYPD for how negatively he had treated them in his previous film on the same subject,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpico-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00006JU7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a>, that starred Al Pacino as the beleaguered cop trying to come clean.

To begin with, ""Prince,"" is both long - the director's cut requires two DVD's, and slow, with very little overt action, or violence.  Treat Williams turns in one of his strongest performances as the title character, Danny Ciello, a NYC police detective in the Special Investigations Unit, in which, at the time, its plain clothes members were given such freedom of action as to earn the nickname ""Princes of the City.""  He and the men in his unit work in narcotics, and are enriching themselves quite nicely: they are suspected, among other misdeeds, of having stolen, and peddled at a profit, the huge haul of drugs resulting from the famous French Connection case.  (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Connection-A-True-Account-of-Cops-Narcotics-and-International-Conspiracy/dp/1592280447/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy</a>, book by Robin Moore, or the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Connection/dp/B0006GANN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Connection</a>of the same name.)  Ciello's conscience has been bothering him, and he comes forward to aid commission staffers make their cases, and to testify for them.  But somehow, he had imagined he could control the investigation once he started it: that he could keep it away from himself, his partners, and his friends, and, of course, he was not able to do that - two of his friends on the force end up eating their guns.

The talented actress Lindsay Crouse, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Games/dp/B00004ZBVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Games</a>) daughter of theater royalty, plays Ciello's wife, Carla.

A very young Cynthia Nixon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Giftset/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)</a>) plays Jeannie, a young drug addict.  Jerry Ohrbach (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Seventh-Year/dp/B002UOMGWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Seventh Year</a>), plays fellow cop Gus Levy, and runs away with the movie: Dick Wolf cast him in that show on the strength of his performance here.  I must say, though, that the film is, to my mind, weakened by many casting errors.  Brian De Palma was originally set to direct, and would have starred Robert De Niro in the title role.  That's casting that would have worked better.  Williams acts very well with his face and eyes, but has a high, soft, almost feminine voice, and throws out some odd vibes for a cop.  Lindsay Crouse is certainly talented, but she was not the girl to play an ethnic NY cop's wife.  An important black part, ""the King,"" was played most forgettably by an actor unknown to me: and this at a time when Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington had already begun working, and were likely available, and Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes may also have already begun working.  There are parts for a couple of Hispanic actors, as Ciello's drug-addicted informers: they too are played by forgettable actors, when Luis Guzman was already working, and it's not easy to forget Luis Guzman.  Most peculiarly of all, there are many parts for Italians/wise guys, and those too are played by easily forgettable actors, whereas anybody who's seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002OID4VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;knows that the New York area is loaded with Italian character actors who can carry their weight.

What Lumet did get right, however, was the zeitgeist of the city in the 1970s.  It was dirty, covered with graffiti, and overrun with drug addicts, and drug-related crime.  What he didn't get right was the fact that this was all about to change very shortly.  1981 actually saw the birth of the AIDS epidemic in New York.  Before very long, all these needle-sharing addicts were to fall victim to the disease, in a phenomenon some cops called ""the self-cleaning oven."" Unfortunately, many of their significant others, and their children were also to become fatally diseased.  But, one way or another, the AIDS plague wiped out the drug plague, and with it, most of the drug-related crime that had so plagued the city.  At any rate, the movie stands as a record of life in 1970s New York.  If you are interested in the subject matter, it might be worth a look.",1273622400,5,5984,6.194444444444445
297702,5,630027182X,"For anyone who appreciates the realness, detail and moral ambiguity (good guy / bad guy) of The Wire, this powerful, groundbreaking movie is essential viewing. It's depiction of the unforeseen consequences and entanglements of a ""War on Drugs"" and what that would eventually bode for those on both sides of the law and the entire degradation of the criminal justice system makes this film timeless.

The scene where each of the prosecutors who worked with Danny Ciello and whose careers he helped make, are asked to debate over his fate should be required viewing for anyone in the criminal justice profession.

I first saw this movie about ten years ago on VHS and always had a difficult time finding it on dvd.

At that time the incredible performance of Treat Williams, who in 3 hours is able to portray the slow, procedural disassembling of a man's personality, character and sanity just left me awestruck.  So much so, that you just can't feel anything but deprived that no one ever went onto give him roles of the depth and breadth normally reserved for the DeNiro's and Pacino's of American cinema.  Before I saw it, I thought ""Treat Williams?"" with Sidney Lumet?

This is a film that deserves to be viewed many times and whose multi-layered message and tragedies are all too important then as they are now.  A prophetic, defining document of the essential problem at the heart of the drug war and how it began to break the criminal justice system, the lives of drug addicts and of the police officers whose own belief in justice and right and wrong are betrayed by a machine whose uncontrollable thirst for prosecution ignores ethics, morals and values for statistics, career advancement and power.

Lumet and Jay Presson Allen have written such a complex yet great script that at times you wish it got the more cinematic dimensions that Scorsese could bring to it as opposed to Lumet's dramatic but austere approach.  In the docs here he discusses his ambivalence towards the main character and you get that watching the film.  He's never given the point of view allowed to Pacino's Serpico or Paul Newman's Frank Galvin.  As a result Treat Williams is all over the place.  He's great in some scenes and in other he's just too much.  (There's even an odd bit where he seems to be doing a Steve Martin imitation.)  Still, this powerful and moving picture (and Williams' performance) deserve a better reputation that it's had over the years.  It packs a bigger punch than Serpico -- also a great picture.

And this really deserves to be revisited alongside American Gangster which covers much of the same territory.  (I assume the character of ""The King"" here is based on Frank Lucas.)

A lot of work went into it obviously, and I could appreciate that, though at times the movie was kind of a frustrating ordeal, not only for the main character but for me as well.  It was hard to really feel his need for redemption to begin with. We know he's somewhat on the take, in the beginning, but we're not really brought to the point of feeling the anguish that brings him to want to turn informant.  This happens soon after the movie begins and we're left reeling in the next two plus hours with his decision.  Really, we are given a few brief incidents (he helps a junkie get smack, and his own brother accuses him of too lavish a lifestyle) - then bam - he wants to talk to the D.A.

Through endless court indictments and the eventual revealing of his own misdeeds, we learn about some of the things which may have brought New York cop, Danny Ciello, to the point of wanting to turn informant (though by that point in the movie he's probably regretting having done so).  But telling is one thing.  Showing is another.  I'd have sympathized more with his whole struggle if I'd been SHOWN stronger reason in the beginning for his wanting to turn, which in the eyes of his colleagues, and even the viewers at times, seems like a weak betrayal - perhaps a character problem rather than an issue of conscience.

As an idea, the dilemma is readily apparent (between what he and indeed the whole legal system deem is right, and the practical realities of the street).

297760,5,630027182X,"First off this is a great movie.  It pushes the boundaries of what film can do, especially mainstream studio films.

Try making this pitch to a studio today----

I want to make a movie who's hero is a corrupt cop, it will be about three hours long and have about two hundred speaking parts.  The main character will have four partners and a couple of dozen federal prosecutors working with him and the audience will be expected to keep track of who's who without a complimentary arrow chart.  And even though this is a cop movie, there are no gunfights or car chases and no mysteries get solved.  (The investigation into the theft of the heroin from ""the French Connection"" bust is a crucial plot point, but it never does get resolved in the movie.) I want to cast a relatively unknown outside of theater actor as the lead and for the crucial supporting role of tough veteran cop I want to cast a good character actor, he's not really a star or anything but he does have alot of experience,  but up to this point in his career he usually specializes in light comedies and Broadway musicals.  The movie doesn't make the cops out to be heros but it doesn't completely villanize them either, merely points out that they're fallible and human and under enormous pressure.  The federal proscutors who are trying to clean up the police corruption will be portrayed as having an admirable goal but the film will portray them as being more ambitious about furthering their careers then completing the case, motivated by election politics, and careless or ruthless with the lives of the cops unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches.  Oh and it also points out that some of the gangsters were capable of surprising amounts of loyalty and compassion.  So there aren't really any heros or villains.

I don't know who had more guts, Lumet for making this movie or the studio chief who greenlighted the project.

Financially they took a beating for taking so many risks and making a film that definitely is not a feel-good crowd pleaser. It asks alot from its audience but if you're willing to invest the time and the effort of trying to remember who is who, then the film has alot of rewards.

First off there's the performances

Treat Williams gave an awesome performance as the main character.  This was his first major part in a major motion picture and unfortunately for Treat he has Paul LeMatt syndrome, where every other role after his breakthrough must seem like a major letdown.  Jerry

Jerry Orbach went from being a bit player in musicals and comedies to dramatic actor and eventually ""Law and Order"" and the man who put Baby in a corner.  He once said in an interview that whenever cops met him on the street and recognized him they usually mentioned ""Prince of the City"" rather than ""Law and Order"".  He's that good in this.  He should have been playing tough cops even earlier in his career.

Lindsay Crouse is very good as the wife.  Just as corrupt in her way as her husband but also probably wiser and more loyal to his friends than he is.

Also look for a very young Cynthia Nixon (from ""Sex and the City"") as a teenaged junkie who gets smacked around by her boyfriend for stealing his heroin when he's jonesing bad.

In a cast of hundreds its tough to point out all of the good performances, but particular memorable were whoever played DiBennedetto and the bald prosecutor Orbach threatens to throw out a window and aim so that he lands right on his pointy head.

Many memorable characters and many memorable lines.  A powerful, tragic tale of brutal honesty and surprising compassion for the corrupted.",1186704000,4,3617,4.637362637362638
297761,5,630027182X,"Almost 3 hours long and worth every minute. As great a cops and mafia film as there are, even comparable to the Godfather saga (I & II). Danny Ciello is a policeman hero, though technically he may be a criminal. These kind of police are the only people that stand between the comfortable beaurocracy class of lawyers and politicians and the jungle of drugadicts and all sorts of criminals. They do the dirty job the talkers won't do but appreciate as long as they themselves don't get caught (anything comparable to Plato's Republic, maybe?)

The question the film poses to the audience is: Do you approve -or not- this kind of police behavior? I say that the law was made for man, and not the other way round. We mustn't miss the aim of the law, lest we get entangled in our own web and become pharisaic.

This is another great Sidney Lumet classic, beautiful and entertaining; it makes you think over and over again about the issues exposed here. It has a great script. The leading actor does superbly. Directed talentedly, detachedly, not too overdramatic.

The thing I like about Lumet's films (the best director in the second half of the 20th century) is that he talks about human nature. His films are not just stories, things that happen as part of a plot. They are little revelations of the human soul. They talk about who more than what. And it's whom we really care for, isn't it? The issues are eternal: love, friendship, faithfulness, resilience, repentence, redemption... everything that separates us from animals, and everything is put to the test, the test of real life situations: where the rubber meets the road (as the great Christian Vernon McGee would say).

A classic but also a great modern film. I recommend Lumet's other great film, besides ""12 Angry men"", which is ""The Hill"".",1186444800,26,1801,4.726114649681529

I won't repeat all the other reviewers' kudos for Williams in the lead-- he is spot-on-- the casting, the pacing or the photography.  Suffice to say that it is the product of a director at the apex of his talent, and a fitting culmination of a great storytelling career ('12 Angry Men,' 'The Pawnbroker,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'Murder on the Orient Express,' 'Network,' etc.).

I found Daley's account of corruption in the ranks of the New York City Police Department and the Knapp Commision hearings mesmerizing.  This led me to Peter Maas' ""Serpico"".  Naturally I hunted down the two films that director Sidney Lumet based on these books.  As much as I liked ""Serpico"" I found ""Prince of the City"" a much more compelling story.  I think this has more to do with the fact that Danny Ciello(Bob Leuci in the book) is a much more enigmatic figure than Frank Serpico.  Serpico was a maverick but there was no questioning his integrity.  Ciello's motives for blowing the whistle are a little more problematic.  As a high profile narcotics detective, Ciello took bribes from organized crime figures and provided his stoolies with drugs among his many sundry offences.  Now you can say that a lot of what Ciello did were necessary evils in conducting his day to day affairs but he also feathered his own personal nest.  When he decides to go clean with the Commision he wants to do it on his own terms, meaning he'll bring down people he has a personal distaste for but not his friends on the force or his partners.  Ciello's handlers have a different agenda, however, that doesn't naturally cohere with his.  ""Prince of the City"" is a long film but it never sags.  Aside from Lumet's crisp direction he also has crafted an engrossingly complex script with Jay Presson Allen.  Treat Williams as Ciello gives a wrenching account of a man in turmoil.  This is the kind of performance that gets overlooked probably because Ciello is a morally ambiguous figure.  This is one of the great American films of the Eighties and one for all time.",1180310400,11,1739,4.6524590163934425
297766,5,630027182X,"This is easily the best film that master director Sidney Lumet has ever made; his masterpiece.  I first saw this on cable TV when it came out. Of course Hollywood ignored it, as they do all Lumet films, because he is a New Yorker, and not in their club.

  This film has it all: true-story reality, intense drama, pain, humor, perfect pacing, etc. The cast is brillant with the late Jerry Orbach reaching his greatest performance. Also, Treat Williams' best perfomance ever.

  I just could not understand why it took so long to release this awesome production on DVD.

  This is a true ""must"" for any film buffs collection.",1180051200,4,624,4.6422018348623855

reviewers have done an admirable job describing it's greatness. After first watching this movie in a theater all those years ago I had emotions similar to those I had after first watching ""The Godfather"" and a very

few other special films that reach true motion picture greatness. I have

watched it many tmes on my VHS copy and will watch it many more on DVD. Don't miss it.",1179964800,4,447,4.493827160493828
297768,5,630027182X,"Since the begining of the DVD era I have searched fo this movie constantly.

I really can't believe how long it has taken to be presented in this format, but after May 2007 I'm sure all will be forgiven.

I won't go into the specifics of the plot as that has been covered in so many reviews here already.

Those of you who have already seen it need not read any further, as I'm sure I would just be preaching to the converted, but to those Prince Of The City ""virgins"" I say ""Turn off the lights, close the blinds and switch off your phone"".

For the next 167 minutes you're out!

I hope you enjoy this movie.

This is Sidney Lumet's finest work and while others see him as a great director, this movie shows him as one of the great storytellers.

Only a true genius of this medium could keep you riveted to the screen for nearly three hour.

When the movie is over you can join the rest of us in wondering where are all the awards are.

It's hard to believe that a movie this good could be so over looked throughout the award season.

I'll save you the trouble of looking it up, the Oscar for the best movie in 1981 was Chariots Of Fire.

And on that I'll leave the final word with Dr. Phil.

297769,5,630027182X,"As superb as this film is, Treat Williams escalates it to eminence. His emotionally vulnerable turncoat cop is palpable and shocking; not for a moment lacking verisimilitude. It's one of the truly great performances by an American actor, in a class with Jack Nicholson in Chinatown. Fortunately Williams is imbedded in a tremendous cast working from the taut screenplay of director Lumet and Jay Presson Allen, who also wrote The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Cabaret, and Marnie. Lumet, who has directed a raft of important films, from The Pawnbroker to Dog Day Afternoon, has never topped this film. It's even finer than his own much better known Serpico. You will never find a better depiction of the fetid gut of the American justice system in the time of drug prohibition.",1171756800,8,774,4.916030534351145

Treat Williams stars as the cop who has just seen too much dirt and starts working to bring it down.  Morals are sometimes hard to draw in this challenging movie, except possibly ""Wrong is wrong, but the status quo is harder to unseat than you could possibly imagine.""

7808436,5,630027182X,"In this masterful, noirish portrayal of 70's NYC and Detective Danny Ciello, a neighborhood guy who does what neighborhood cops often do, falls in contrast with the politicians and the FBI.  Slowly, he has a change of heart and realizes that he has way too much power; indeed, he starts beating on his informants who are heroin addicts and crack addicts.

He and all his partners wear gold rolexes, have the best clothes, and wear expensive watches.  They are loyal to each other; not to the public and not to the criminal or his or her welfare.  They are completely jaded.  Halfway through you almost wish Ciello stayed dirty because he loses his whole world.  He is a rat, and as one sort of classic gangster tells him, ""he's never going to be able to live with himself"".  A sad, but very real film.",1505001600,,801,4.520833333333333
