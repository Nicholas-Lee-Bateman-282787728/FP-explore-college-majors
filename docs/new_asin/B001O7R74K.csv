The incredible power of this film makes it an absolute Must Watch -- especially for us ""ignorant white folks"" who see South Central as just a gang problem.",1242345600,4,279,4.264150943396227
3729215,5,B001O7R74K,"Simply some of the most powerful footage and commentary on race in America I've ever seen.  Powerful Powerful stuff.  Something every American should sit down and pay very close attention to. The section on the Watts Riots gave me chills....just incredibly well done.  The explication of the economic foundation of LA's ghettoization is succinct and 100% on target.  The way the film traces the roots of today's problems so clearly to Slavery, Jim Crow, and the marginalization of the American black in the most prosperous period after WWII is pitch perfect.  It's hard to comprehend how someone can grow up in LA and never have seen the Pacific Ocean...but that insular world of crips and bloods is an epidemic America is going to have to confront sooner or later.

3729216,5,B001O7R74K,"I just saw this movie last night and will be returning again to see it. It was very powerful, much more so than I would have ever imagined.

The film traces back through history, detailing the ""roots of rage"", so to speak, for the black man in Los Angeles. The film is never boring, utilizing archival film clips from the past, interspersed with interviews from past gang members who are incredibly articulate and erudite. Kumasi's barely controlled ire is tempered with measured intelligent speech. I was enthralled.

The only surprise for me was the lack of mention of the influence of rap music vis a vis the gangs, although there is plenty to be had on the soundtrack throughout.",1238025600,14,683,4.73109243697479

This video to me was an introductory to a culture and group that has been oppressed and there is so much twist and turns but I finally have some insight and understanding.

It's that simple. This film should be included in all archives in all schools across America. It is our history.
I stumbled on this documentary after watching a skateboarding movie called Dogtown And Z-Boys. I am a product of the 70's coming of age in the 80's and I wanted to go old school to figure out how a middle-class white boy came to be riding a gator board with a bunch of rich kids down the hills in Barrington, RI. Now at 40 years old I finally know.
The origin and the original founders of surfing and skating has led me to this documentary and I am even more enlightened.
If i was ignorant I wouldn't be searching for answers and the truth. The truth is what I found in this documentary.
The OG's in this documentary have it right you must educate, guide and provide a positive opportunity for the kids while they are young and naive in order for them to be free. Learn history and become less ignorant, learn a trade-craft to put food on the table, teach a man to fish and he will never go hungry.

3729262,4,B001O7R74K,"When Dog Town Z Boys came out, I took my , then , preteen son to see the movie and to my  amazement this was about Bay Street, Jeff Ho and Skip and the young guys that hung out at Jeff Ho's Surfboard Shop. I surfed Bay Street with those guys .Now, years later the film maker comes out with a film that includes an unknown ,outside of South Central L.A., Bird of the Slausons who I went to Jacob A. Riis High School with in the late 50's and early 60's. These films represent two extremely different periods of my life and would never have any connection except this Film maker made both films. I can't really explain who Bird was to me except to say that most White Kids at that time probably had John Wayne and maybe a few, James Dean as their hero. The few White kids that were sent to Riis usually only lasted one day, I stayed for three years and had one of my best experiences in life and education, not traditional education. The real story of that period , before the Crips and Bloods ,when the Slausons, Huns , Midget Florencia,Quarter Gang and more , did more punching then shooting, before the Watts rebellion where those neighborhoods were not much different then the deep south as far as racism, police brutality and semi economic slavery was concern, is briefly touched on in this film. Bird does not look like Bird anymore then I look like I did in my teens and maybe there are not enough alive or on the streets that could truly define that period of time. I thank the Film Maker for bringing back memories of those days and the amazing Bird, Ernest Williams, of the Slausons.",1335312000,3,1591,4.3389261744966445

The knowledge of gang origin and participation is presented in lay terms.

3729264,3,B001O7R74K,"The film is less about the Crips and Bloods as it is about the social history of LA.  The film was good, but again, just really was not a Crips/Bloods documentary.  If your looking to learn about the gangs, this is not the film for you.  If you want a good genrealy social commentary on why black LA is as it is, this is a good film.  I feel the first half of the film does a great job, through interviews, of detailing why things happened (""riots"") as they did - from the black community point of view.  I'd like to see this direction expored in greater detail, and a seperate film focused only on the gangs, i.e., history, structure, everyday life, economics etc.",1326585600,,665,4.330645161290323
3729275,5,B001O7R74K,"After Dogtown and the Z-Boys and Riding Giants covered the skateboard and surf worlds, Stacy Peralta turned his attention to LA's South Central gang wars. Peralta is probably America's most talented documentary filmmaker (sorry, overrated Mikey Moore) by letting the people involved tell the story.

By tying the two riots (Watts in '65 and the Rodney King trial verdict one of '92) together as well as showing how African Americans were ghettoized by a combination of segregated real estate policies and heavyhanded policing, the movie paints a damning picture of the US as a whole in its inability to offer solutions to a solvable problem.",1323388800,,641,5.104761904761904

3729277,2,B001O7R74K,"Disappointed but not surprised.  I was a huge fan of Powell Peralta's skateboard videos of the 80s - Peralta is responsible for Tony Hawks ascension so I've always liked that part of Peralta.  He should have stuck to trying to make more skate videos.

My single biggest complaint about this movie is its lack of substance regarding the actual gangs.  Much of the footage is still photographs of gangsters just posing.  Wow, how riveting! (sarcasm)  Much of movie deals with the history of black la, which is the most interesting and substantive piece of the film but then why is the movie named after 2 gangs and not ""history of black la""....yep, you guessed it......no one would fund or watch the movie of just another history channel piece.

The movie touches upon some real issues such as racism in  the California prison system, lack of father figures, lack of opportunities, and negligence from elected officials, but the movie doesnt know what its identity is whether it wants to crank its rap soundtrack to appeal to impressionable young males or emphasize historical footage to get the older folks attention, its disjointed.

If someone wants to see a silver lining in the gang world of LA then check out Father Boyle and Homeboy industries and look to Dr Arron Kipnis for his thoughts on prison reform - 2 inspirational, real deal heads in the trenches, unlike what appears to be some phonies in Crips and Bloods.",1304035200,,1422,4.795081967213115
3729278,5,B001O7R74K,"This film is profound and should be shared in the classroom in sociology and psychology classes.  It deals with social, cultural and economic issues that impact society within and outside of its boundaries.",1293667200,,206,5.242424242424242
3729279,5,B001O7R74K,"The documentary lays down the socio-political context that defines much of the contemporary African-American experience in the US of A. Broken families, bad schools, no jobs, rampant violence that often has no visible cause. A society in disintegration where joining a ""gang""  means joining a family. It is clear to even the casual viewer that building more prisons is not going to solve the problems faced by those communities. Nor will giving more tax breaks and unearned bonuses to vampire squids.

The film is based on interviews with current and former gang members, and a few dedicated and caring activists who see the kids in gangs as human beings who have an inalienable right to a decent, safe and happy life. What struck me was the eloquence of the interviewees as well as the raw pain speaking - the pain of loss, the pain of the child, the pain of the outsider. Pain that needs to be kept under the tough guy facade 'because only the strong survive'. The beauty and heart-shattering grief of women experiencing the loss of their kids, nephews and grandchildren. The raw, human power that is squandered by keeping those young people ghettoed in.

I'd be interested in seeing how  the reviewers croaking about ""personal responsibility"" on these pages felt if they were harassed by the police every time they crossed a certain street (into a neighborhood where they were not 'supposed' to be). If they had been kept away from progress, growth, respect, education, equal opportunity by the lack of access and institutionalized neglect. I find it amazing that the film does not make you sad or make you want to help, but rather compels you to display your own disconnectedness and lack of humaneness. It is that same disconnectedness that made you vote for a guy who wasted a trillion dollars in Iraq - instead of spending it on inner city schools. It is the same lack of humaneness which makes you vote to give million dollar bonuses to fat cat bankers instead of building new highways. Or kindergartens. Or jobs. The youngsters interviewed in the film are your fellow citizen - and you don;t care. That, my friends, is despicable and morally, ethically and spiritually reprehensible.

The film is well made, with good & noble intentions while sparse on the moralizing front. It does not preach. It simply documents peoples' lives and fates through faces, sounds and images. I hope it will touch you as it touched me. And I hope things will change and those young people get to experience hope. And freedom.",1292889600,6,2515,4.825986078886311

3729283,5,B001O7R74K,"I want to start off by indicating that I found this documentary very worthwhile. That being the case, the title is a bit misleading as it does not get so in-depth with gangs themselves but gives more of an explanation about where the anger of young black men in Los Angeles came from and why gangs formed in the first place.

It was very revealing, utilizing old footage as examples. They explained the catalyst for rioting. They showed the poor treatment of minorities by law enforcement. While watching, you really get the sense of how someone might feel like everyone hates them, which would definitely trigger one to hate back. Hate fuels hate.

This is a worthwhile watch, just understand that it isn't going to get into the inner workings of gangs as some other documentaries do.",1280016000,,785,4.7226277372262775

3729306,3,B001O7R74K,"Crips and Bloods: Made in America: 5 out of 10: This documentary starts out with the eye opening fact that the 15,000 killed in gang violence between the Crips and the Bloods is 5 times the number killed in The Troubles in Northern Ireland. I found this particularity poignant since the Irish troubles always struck me as one of the stupidest wars in modern history. Clearly The Crips and the Bloods are also in that category. (One might also note that in both conflicts the participants consist almost entirely of people; too poor or too stupid to move out of the neighborhood when the best and brightest already fled. But I will get to that in a minute.)

First a bit of praise. The documentary is well shot with great music and narration and a nice selection of both interview subjects and ideas. You very well may learn something and you cannot help feel for those that have senseless suffered from the violence.

I sometimes come down hard on documentaries that are one sided pieces of propaganda that try to fit every fact into their pre-conceived notions. Crips and Bloods surprisingly doesn't do that. Instead it is all over the map blaming everything from whitey, to absentee fathers, to whitey, to factories closing down, to whitey, to immigrants, and even white people share some of the blame in this documentary. Every five minute blurb seems to have a different bad guy. Though in most cases the finger often points back to whitey. (Fathers wouldn't be absent if THE MAN didn't keep jailing them ect)

 But with an African American in the White House the films analysis seems hopeless dated. The question of why the gangs are still fighting is left unanswered. And the black middle class and upper classes flight is left unmentioned as either a cause of the troubles (which it clearly contributed to) or an effect (Honestly no-one blames white people for poverty in Appalachia so why should blacks in Brentwood be responsible for the poor of Compton?)

The other cause often left unmentioned are the gangbangers themselves taking the easy way out. I have rarely heard so many grown men blame their mothers outside of a Borsch Belt comedy. Somebody needs to buy these gangbangers a mirror and a clue.

The film does a wonderful job painting the rather long history of this area of Los Angeles including immigration during World War 2, both riots and the civil rights struggles. But it struggles once it hits 1980 or so and that is a shame. I guess the answers for the last twenty five years of bloodshed are not as clear. And one feels they are also not as flattering to the victimization that some of the subjects wear like a badge of honor.",1266278400,2,2654,4.684549356223176
3729307,5,B001O7R74K,"Most other documentaries simply make a spectacle of the gang life, with footage of shootings, drug dealing, and gangbangers with their faces covered talking about how ruthless they are. instead of any kind of in-depth examination of the anatomy of a gang member, they market as much sensational violence as they can compile, and pepper the footage with criticisms that depict all gang members as evil, crazy, and irredeemable.

This documentary was made with great care and genuine respect for the subjects, rather than the objectified versions we've become accustomed to. this is the only one that really deals with their humanity, and the very predictable inevitability of their rise in the wake of the FBI's COINTELPRO. it's the only one that cites evidence that the children of LA have greater levels of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder than the children of Iraq. and we know how the hostile conditions of the Middle East create extremism. it's no surprise then that the hostile conditions of the 50's and 60's birthed organized aggressive resistance. and it's no surprise that, after the FBI succeeded at turning that aggression upon itself by first destroying the leadership and then flooding the leaderless areas with drugs and weapons, what arose was the madness that we see in the streets today.

this movie deals with the aftermath. it deals with what it's like to actually BE a child who grew up with this inherited legacy. it's real. the realest one so far. one of the only documenaries blessed by the OG's of los angeles. the other one was directed by an OG blood from Athens Park, called Bastards of the Party.

if you want to know what the crazy gang life LOOKS like, then you might want to move on to one of the lesser films out there. but if you're trying to understand what it FEELS like, from the inside, then this is probably the best documentary that has ever been made on the subject.

The fact this whole film was dedicated to blaming Large corporations for deserting Black Families and leaving them no other choice but to become Criminals, left a bad taste in my mouth.

Considering how broad the subject matter is, and pervasively deep, it must have been extremely difficult choosing clips for the final cut, and keeping the film at an affordable/doable/reasonable length.

Conversely, the prevailing Condition, and ongoing Cycle, could not be adequately covered in a 10 hour film.

Watching the film for the first time, putting other reviews aside, I applied this context.

2015 UPDATE:

I have watched this film/documentary several more times. It is Brilliant across the board, including the Deleted Scenes. Real, authentic, meaningful, substantive interviews and contributions...

In addition, the film stands completely on its own - in need of no celebrity rapper advertisement or endorsement.",1252454400,2,758,5.663716814159292
3729313,1,B001O7R74K,"This video is junk. Every b and c documentary covers the watts riots and the eventual lack of leadership leading up to the 2 gangs. It explains nothing of how it started or why it started. It actually covers very little of the 2 gangs themselves. I myself am a former blood gang member out of Las Vegas, Nevada. As I know it, the crips started out of a need to belong to something and a need for a fatherly figure. As the gladiators, slausons, and the buisiness before them they fought other gangs with their fists. through time the the fights began to get worse with bats, pipes, and knives being used. The crips gang became the largest and most dominant gang at the time. The smaller gangs that were being ""picked on"" decided enough was enough. A meeting of 5 different gangs took place (the brimms, the compton boys, and the avenues are the only 3 i know). In this meeting the gangs decided to start an alliance. Now at the time most of the gangs wore blue due to everybody wanting to be like the crips. So this new alliance decided to change their color to red and come up with a name, Pirus/bloods. The name Piru is a street in Compton, California and the name blood because of the family concept such as blood brothers. That as far as I know is where the bloods came from. The idea was for the bloods to protect them and the others in their neighborhoods from the crips. Somewhere some how someone was killed by one side and the other side took revenge by killing one from the other side. This is why it has been so bloody over the years. When someone kills your bestfriend or ur family member, the first thought that comes to your mind is revenge. The hate for eachother runs so deep over these deaths that getting these two gangs to stop is nearly impossible. this war is has as much emotion as any relugous ar cultural war has. Its also very addicting a young man cause yes you do feel extremely powerful, almost like a god to hold a gun in your hand and know that you have the power to take life and to allow it to live. People who look at you in fear cause they know what you are or may be makes you feel even more powerful, here is this grown man looking terrified of me and im only a teen. The sad thing is if you don't look at them with fear they will want to put that fear into you, Fear is respect and respect is the only thing that matters on the streets. I have been out of the gang for 4 years now and 7 years in the gang. Even to this day when I see somone wearing blue or recognize them as a crip member i catch myself wanting to harm them. I have lost to many friends to ever forget about who i once was or who i once fought.",1251849600,9,2647,4.121856866537717
3729314,5,B001O7R74K,"I was skeptical. What does a blonde (now grey) former professional skateboarder (now film maker) from the other side of town know about gang wars in LA? And then there's me: a white guy from the suburbs in Ohio who was raised by a gun collector who is still pretty open about his use of the""N"" word. When I hear about gang violence: I just shrug: ""It's probably a fight over something stupid."" Still, this film remained in my queue and wasn't working its way up very quickly.

I elevated this movie to #1 when Michael Vick was signed by the Eagles. In one week: I heard two accounts from completely different lifestyles: Prissy ESPN sports talk show host Mike Greenberg declared that he had never heard of the subculture known as dog fighting until the Vick case made the news. Vick stated that dog fighting in his childhood neighborhood was so common that police would stop to see a fight and then drive away. Dog fighting was the norm. It was then when I knew I had to check out Peralta's newest movie as I'd loved the Dog Town and Z Boys documentary.

The first 25-30 minutes of the movie covers pre-1970 race riots in LA and other cities. How invisible lines created ""hoods"" by police who would commonly question straying pedestrians about ""why don't you go back to your neighborhood?"" Then abruptly, the movie takes a sharp turn when vocal black leaders like MLK, Malcom X and others are thrown in jail or murdered. Suddenly, all the icons were gone. Think of the Living Colour song: Cult of Personality - ""When that leader speaks, that leader dies.""

For the rest of the movie I was hooked. I couldn't grasp what was happening. The Crips and Bloods seemed to come out of nowhere. Peralta seemed to have skipped something important. But he didn't. I didn't understand how there were suddenly two gangs. I didn't understand why they were divided and bent on killing each other based on territories, red or blue bandanas, or other reasons.

Before the movie ended, I got it. Young black men without fathers, mentors or real leadership took a downward turn. Image, status and bravado became a common theme in neighborhoods where there is no hope. I will admit that I'm a Republican with strong beliefs that everybody should pull their weight and not rely on handouts. In a world where police often respond by use of strong force, there's little reason to NOT question authority. I have no solutions. The oppressed respond to violence, with violence.

Jim Brown has a couple of short appearances (he's not in the film enough in my opinion) and he is quoted by someone in the extras: ""If the police have not resolved the problem in 40 years, they never will resolve the problem."" It's about oppression, not the gangs themselves. Stacey says the an outtake that he wanted to make this movie because he didn't understand why there is no gang violence in suburban or upscale neighborhoods. Why are people arming themselves and having gun battles with former childhood friends in impoverished communities?

This movie is a must see for anyone even mildly afraid to drive thru certain neighborhoods or better yet, the generation of kids from the suburbs who were raised on hip hop, MTV and anything that glorified the gangsta lifestyle. In the extras, Snoop Dog and Lil Wayne each give a heartfelt, unscripted point of view that really was impressive.",1250899200,29,3346,4.711111111111111

I didn't have the money to go to college so I joined the Marine Corps, saved my money and got a college education courtesy of the G.I bill. With my college education and trade skills learned in the service, I now have a good job. This documentary is full of excuses why these kids are in the situation they are in. I know they had hard lives growing up, but why does that stop them from joining the military like I did and making a good life for themselves? Liberals will provide plenty of excuses as to why they are unable to join. What's the best way to make this stop? Quit enabling them with crap like this, and hold them accountable.

I put the DVD in and sat back and watched the history on these two gangs, black rights, gangs then and now, and so on. I enjoyed this documentary but was a little disappointed because I was looking for some knitty-gritty  doc where it shows day to day gang life with shootings, crack deals, drinkin' 40's and rollin' blunts, and tons of eff bombs like ""mutha eff this"" and ""mutha eff that"", and all that other great jazz that goes along in a gang bangers life.

3729327,3,B001O7R74K,"This documentary basically bases its entire point of view on leftist sociologists, and in essence blames the ""system"" for crime. Why is it that a dark guy from India or Pakistan or Africa can move to L.A. and start his own business and is not ""pushed"" into being in a gang, his kids study hard and go to college, and they don't do violence or sell drugs, but a black American supposedly is forced into a gang, because ""white America"" is so bad and oppressive. I don't buy this. It would have been nice if the documentary had interviewed someone, anyone, who doesn't allow these guys a ""pass"" because they are supposedly oppressed. I am sure that the are a lot of sociologists and community leaders who don't buy this viewpoint. Follow the logic here: I am white, and there are many poor whites who were supposedly screwed over by the system, by the military, or by having a prior conviction. But we don't allow them a ""pass"" because of that. I refuse to give criminals a pass, whether they are white, Latino, or black.",1248480000,5,1018,4.508108108108108

3729330,5,B001O7R74K,"Tears cascade down the faces of family members holding pictures of loved ones murdered by gangs in the streets of their communities. Los Angeles, California has a history of destructive social unrest beginning in the early 1940's that created the environment from which, two of the world's most notorious street gangs, the Crips and the Bloods was born. Crips and Bloods: Made in America is a hard-hitting emotional documentary that is gripping and compelling. Debuting as an Original Selection at the Sundance film festival in 2007, this film has been regarded as one of the best documentaries created in years.
Crips and Bloods: Made in America is Directed by Stacey Peralta and Narrated by Emmy Award winning actor Forest Whitaker. Produced for DVD release by Ducudrama Films in 2009, this unrated documentary is a comprehensive and emotional film that keeps on giving. This film is a historical chronicle on the development of the Crips and Bloods street gangs.
The plot of the movie is to identify the causative factors of gang activity and offers solutions to the problem using history and individuals involved in gang activity. University professors, interventionists, active gang members and community leaders discuss gang life and its impacts on individuals, families and society as a whole during in-depth personal interviews. Historical events are presented in a storytelling format supported by newspaper articles and graphic video footage. The interviews and stories are intermixed throughout the film resulting in a complete work on Crips and Bloods that leaves no topic untouched.
I think that the personal nature of the interviews coupled with the historical backdrop is one of the most interesting features of Crips and Bloods: Made in America. The viewer gets a sense of realness and humanity from the interviewees. Ex-gang members reflect on their past and discuss how and why they changed their ways. Active gang members show frustration and a desire for their lives to be different. One of the most emotional parts of the film is the interviews of family members who have been killed in gang violence. They share the stories of their loved ones and exhibit deep sorrow while explaining different coping mechanisms they use to get by on a daily basis. The way in which the interviews are presented can have the viewer heartily laughing or shedding tears.
I highly recommend this movie. Anyone interested in gangs would enjoy this movie. Law Enforcement could gain benefit from the movie in training sessions as it gives historical perspective and shows gang members as being human beings with feelings. Educators from junior high school through college could use this film for classes ranging from gang prevention/intervention to American history to Administration of Justice. Families should share this movie with their children at an age them deem appropriate as a parenting tool.
There is usage of graphic language and images of violence that some viewers may find objectionable. I think that the movie presents all of that in context and to omit such would defeat the purpose of the move and detract from the overall message. A unique feature of this project is that it is ongoing and viewers are encouraged and shown how that they can get involved in its efforts. I give Crips and Bloods: Made in America five out of five stars.",1247097600,5,3353,5.098181818181819

I even watched ALL the extras, and I've never done that with any movie, but I truly couldn't get enough of this.  Did you know that the kids in LA have higher incidents of post-traumatic stress than the kids in Baghdad?? Or that over 15,000 lives have been lost due to the gang wars?? Think about those things... I think this film should be required in schools all over the country.  If you watch the film, pay close attention to Kumasi.  His self-reflection and wisdom is more than incredible; he should be Professor Kumasi.  I could listen to him ""spit his wisdom"" every day.  Besides Kumasi, the thing I liked best about this is that there IS hope, there are solutions and hopefully one day these problems can be solved.

However, given that this is labeled ""Crips and Bloods...,"" I was expecting to learn more about the rise, structure and inner workings of these gangs.  The documentary briefly touched on the founding of these gangs, and definitely interviewed gang members, but the substance was much, much broader than the gangs themselves and really about the plight of inner-city LA.

The other issue is that this documentary is pretty slow to get its point across.  It relies heavily on interviews and doesn't present a lot of information to help string the interview snippets together into solid points.  The viewer is left to glean this on her own.
