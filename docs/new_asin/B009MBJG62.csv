5351567,4,B009MBJG62,"I've enjoyed exploring the world of Toby Ross over the past couple of years and naturally I'm always thrilled to check out any Ross endeavor. Homosexual is a great example of what a Mockumentary should be as it's filled with great insights, sly humor, and liberal doses of warmth. Toby has chosen to explore the various aspects of gay culture and lifestyles which aren't always shown through various forms of media or even talked about as a general rule of thumb. Rather than ridiculing or judging any particular party or groups of people, the film chooses to shed light on the issues most of us have always had a secret desire to know but probably didn't know exactly who to ask. Ross, himself, makes an appearance and lends his view in regards to specifics he recalls and the men that he adored. Compliments of the Ross photography archives, we are also treated to some very lovely photographs of beautiful men in various levels of dress or lack thereof. As one has to come to expect, we also are allotted several passionate scenes of lovemaking. If you are curious about the homosexual male and would like clarification on the lifestyle, Homosexual is certainly a great film as far as starting places go. Fans of Ross' work in general will swoon as well.",1365206400,9,1257,4.6923076923076925
5351568,4,B009MBJG62,"One of Toby Ross's documentary style productions regarding Gay life with flashbacks to some of his earlier works
with much new material. Interesting.",1364601600,,149,5.521739130434782
5351569,4,B009MBJG62,"I got hooked on Toby Ross's films quite a while ago because of the gay comedic aspects of exaggeration and don't write reviews because you know ... really....  This one is diffent in that it sort of sets a milemarker and point of reference.

The interviews or little monologues were good because they showed indication of some sense of wanting to be intentional and lossing some of the false bravado of youth.  It would be so easy to get critical and point out all the flaws however, since the film is playful in its structure, let's leave it there.

One major highlight is the interview with Joe Rubin.  Joe has been in Toby's other films and has done some directing in them as well as other various aspects of film making.  I believe in the film he said he is 23.  I am very interested to see how he matures in his craft.  He is becoming purposeful.  The artist learning how to control the medium of communication making clear what he intends to relay to us.",1363824000,,960,4.409090909090909
5351570,3,B009MBJG62,"I like the premice, a radio talk show host talking about gay culture with ""the players"" of Chicago's gay crowd. They actually used the real deal ""players"" from the community.
This film actually portrayed some redeeming thoughts! It talks about the 10% of the gay population that everyone sees, and perceives as the ""stereotypical"" gay person, as well as the hidden gay population, like the guys that just go to work and don't wear their sexual orientation as a badge of honor or difference to society.
It also sheds light on the ""straight"" guys who enjoy fooling around, in the gym showers or at an adult theater, maybe they're not so straight...
As the film introduces each of the guests, there is an extended video montage of their works. These montages are great for the graphic nudity, sexual situations and eye candy!
Stuff I didn't like about the film...
This DVD turns into a preview of other Toby Ross, Hornbill, BDF films, complete with not so subliminal product placements...
While I am not a video producer, and the quality is certainly better than I could do, I think you need some constructive feedback. Maybe those close to you, are too close to criticize your work.
This production group needs guidance with lighting, lots of hot spots in just about every scene. This production group needs guidance with audio, too much variation with the sound, in one scene shots from one angle are loud, and from another are soft. Audio throughout fluctuates greatly from scene to scene. This production group needs guidance with editing and continuity, several very rough cuts, with inappropriate frames between. A sleeveless arm from a man (wearing a jacket) is seen in a close up as he reaches toward another character. This production group needs guidance with acting, quit reading your lines, memorize them and live them! Give the actors the freedom to become their characters and talk in a dialect that is natural for them, you don't need to read the script verbatim.
Like the DVD ""Justin, A Gift from the Gods"" most of the hot, nude, sexual footage, is reused and recycled (some editing room floor footage from other films, recognizable to Toby Ross followers) from other previous productions and just spliced in to juice up the film.
Overall, there is something special about Hornbill, BDF, and Toby Ross films, as long as they're still producing them, I'm still buying them!",1363478400,10,2385,4.876847290640394
5351571,5,B009MBJG62,"""Homosexual"" is a film that challenges one of the main dilemmas if gay life - its very identity, and it is done with an appeal to the intellect and the senses at the same time, which in and of itself is pretty amazing.

Toby Ross confronts the idea that ""gay"" and ""homosexual"" by definition and way of life are actually mutually exclusive realities and he makes his case with a compelling representation of the ideal male fantasy that has been a hallmark of his films and has made them unique and memorable.

What I find especially appealing in this film is the non confrontational way in which he makes his case for the ""iceberg"" of reality ever present in the gay world, a fact or belief that 90% of all homosexuals lie well beneath the gay radar in private worlds that do not conform in any way to what the general public understands as ""the gay lifestyle,"" with its ongoing public presence and often stereotypical characterizations.

It seems to me that Toby Ross, who appears in this film to make his case, does so with an elegant passion for male sexuality and sensuality that is compelling and a pleasure to witness first hand.

I enjoyed every second of this film because it made me think about his challenge and at the same time made me understand his emotional and intellectual passion for the pure alluring beauty of male sensuality.",1363305600,6,1344,4.610878661087866
5351572,4,B009MBJG62,"This is an out of the box look at Homosexuals. I am a parent to a gay son and was curious to take a look at this Mock-Umentary for obvious reasons.
It tells you that Gays basically divide into two major group : Those who are into it for the sex and those who are looking for relationships (Hey is it really that black and white? how about those who are into it for both) Although it is a bit unforgiving and I don't know if I agree with it all, I found it worthwhile. The live reenactments were an eyeful and it goes through all the levels and strands of gay guys. At one point the young (23) director claims ""It's the flamboyance that keeps us from being totally accepted"" Well I would say it is the narrow minds more then the flamboyance. The highlight of this piece was when two sailor (the real thing) one gay one straight come for a naked photo session unveiling a plethora of mental issues. The photo session its self looked beautiful and would remind you of a different time. A more innocent and friendly time. All and all it was interesting and fun.",1362787200,31,1057,4.263681592039801

8542998,5,B009MBJG62,"This DVD addresses some very basic issues regarding homosexuals and asks who should be out who shouldn't and why. It provides some insights as to why gay life and its perks are not for everyone, myself being out to myself but not necessarily to the whole world since this is how I chose to live found this DVD incredibly insightful and helpful. You are who you are, but it's your choice keeping to yourself or letting the world know. Personally I like the sex but hate the lifestyle and this documentary told me that I am not alone. Thank you Mr. Ross, you gave me a peace of mind.",1398384000,,581,4.339449541284404
8542999,3,B009MBJG62,"This was a like, but not love gay themed movie for me, and the reasons are numerous. The debates among certain interviewees, were annoyingly cliched: if you aren't out, you aren't proud, if your married to a woman, but have a boyfriend on the side, you're either a closet gay or bisexual. To me, the flamboyance of the pride marches are making us/ LGBT community) look rather freaky, if we want equality, and most of us do, we should be more respectful of ourselves and the public. Having discretion and respect doesn't have to coincide with shame. I used to come out as bi/gay with everyone I met rather quickly, but I'm working on ending that, because, frankly, it's not everyone's business.",1394928000,2,693,4.688524590163935
8543000,5,B009MBJG62,"HOMOSEXUAL presents a dazzling series of interview-segments of current opinions and attitudes among gay men about male-for-male love, cleverly structured as responses to a talk-show. Everything from Platonic romanticism to hum-drum marital bliss is covered by many interviewees (ranging from office workers and a closeted bi to snotty therapists and young and older filmmakers) in expressive close-ups. This is an amusing, informative, and provocative kaleidoscope of 21st century U.S.A. gay variations and viewpoints. Ross conclusion: 90% of the gay universe is underwater. There are quite a lot of beautiful erotic passages in this movie (mostly nostalgic), but no way is it to be classified as porn.",1387065600,,702,5.632075471698113
8543001,5,B009MBJG62,"Toby Ross is a great and under-appreciated American filmmaker.  His stuff is comparable to the edgier films from Todd Haynes and Gus Van Sant.  Toby tells stories that totally get under your skin.

""Homosexual"" is a brilliant example of Ross's recent films drawing upon his four decades of work.  The films narrative centers on Ross and two other younger directors: Joe Rubin and Delbert Jones.  It provides an amazing look inside the evolution of gay culture, history and the desires of often-closeted men. Ross provides behind the scenes narration.  My favorite scene is about performers at gay theaters. Stuff I've never scene before.

I like Toby's inclusion of Joe Rubin. He's a smart cool dude and I like his sexy mind.

Don't buy this flick if you are looking for raw sex; buy it if you like films like ""My Own Private Idaho"" or ""Velvet Goldmine.""  ""Homosexual"" is gay documentary filmmaking at its best.",1377129600,,911,4.863636363636363
8543002,1,B009MBJG62,"Not sure why this film was made. Its not quite a documentary, not quite a film with a story. Lots of photos of naked men,
