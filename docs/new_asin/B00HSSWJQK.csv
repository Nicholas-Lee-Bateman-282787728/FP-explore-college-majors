Anyone who loves animals, children or stories of those who overcome tragedy will enjoy this movie. If you can find the DVD with subtitles, grab it!  They are few and far between.",1502496000,,320,4.423728813559322

The seller is excellent.  I received the movie very quickly and in excellent condition.  It's a win/win!!!",1407456000,,283,4.957446808510638
8635588,5,B00HSSWJQK,"This is an excellent movie.  While Mari is the star, the children are the real focus of the movie.  Heartwarming without being overboard.  Fans of Japanese dramas will recognize a number of familiar faces.  While I hesitate to give away the ending, I also feel that readers might want to have some idea to decide if they want to watch the movie.  It is not a sad ending.  I highly recommend this movie.",1357344000,,402,4.438356164383562

8635590,5,B00HSSWJQK,"Based on a true story in Japan during a big earthquake.
The mother of three puppies does her best to take care of them while the rest of the village is evacuated.
I am a little biased because I used to have a Shiba-Inu
so I can see the loyalty there.",1312934400,,250,3.9215686274509802
