5194741,5,B008YYSEN4,"This is truly a WONDERFUL movie!  It captures the essence of what Christmas is all about.  I was moved to tears several times and was so drawn to the character ""Jes"" that I actually wanted to be in that scenario to be able to walk and talk with Him!  His explanation of ""God coming for a visit"" was extraordinary!  EVERYONE needs to see this!",1259539200,15,342,4.296875
5194742,5,B008YYSEN4,"During the busy holiday season it's easy to get caught up in all the hustle and bustle and materialism of our culture. The Perfect Gift is a story that reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas. The story is modern, and focuses on love at the core. It is suitable for both kids and adults and is family friendly.

I really enjoyed the Perfect Stranger and the same actor plays Jesus in this one. Both of these movies have great meaning and especially at Christmas, the Perfect Gift is perfect!",1258848000,18,495,4.43956043956044
5194743,5,B008YYSEN4,"This movie is absolutely wonderful!  If you have spoiled your children the way the world says is ok to do, you and your kids have to watch this movie.  This movie has no cursing, sex, and no crude humor.  What this movie does have is a young girl who has been given every material thing to keep her occupied so she would stay out of her parents hair, much like most kids in our society today.  She had been given everything except the most important thing; she had not been taught the truth about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

In this movie, her rich parents divorce and she ends up living with her mom who gets the lower end of the stick, which equals up to the bare necessities to include a regular job (for income), an apartment with lights and running water (for shelter), food on the go (nourishment for the physical body), clothes (so they wouldn't be indecently exposed), and nothing extra.  The extra is where is the issues lie.

This little girl has the biggest attitude because she has been reduced to living like normal people, and she doesn't know how to handle it until she's introduced to Jesus Christ, incognito, known as Jess.  To make a long story short, after spending a very short time with ""Jess"", the little girl's attitude disappears and her character has done a 180.  Now that's the power of Jesus, live and in action.

Every family must see this movie.  It deserves 10 stars, but Amazon doesn't go up that far.",1252886400,73,1440,4.478927203065134

Not bad, but not especially fabulous either. Thinly veiled disgust at the current cultural trends are more than obvious, and the references to historically inaccurate ""Christmas"" traditions are annoying.

5194860,1,B008YYSEN4,"There is no love in this story.  The plot pushes the paranoid Christian Right values that the government is out to get them (tearing down a nativity scene at the church), ""Happy Holidays"" are bad words (it is Christmas--who cares if that isn't your religion), kids should do what they are told (or mom will take away your aunt's gift), respect all adults (even when you are a teen alone with a man who caresses your face with icing (yes it is icky).  I used to like saying ""Merry Chirstmas"" but this movie ruined it for me--it has now become a conspiracy to say you don't count vs. it's original message that we all deserve love and respect.",1482710400,5,641,4.423728813559322

5194891,5,B008YYSEN4,Great story line.  The acting is not really too bad actually.  I don't really like the fact that they portrayed Jesus to be in the film as that really doesn't line up with scripture.  It would of been better if he was an angel or something.  Also don't base the movie on the cover because the people are not even in it.,1480032000,,319,4.096774193548387

5194921,5,B008YYSEN4,"I saw this movie before I purchased three to give as Christmas gifts. There are no scenes where the hero gets missed by every assault weapon bullet fired at him and every shot the hero takes gets the the bad guy in the heart. There are no scenes where the cars are spinning around in the middle of the city at 90 MPH and not having accidents. There is no gratuitous sex scenes or vulgar language. But, is a very nice movie that makes believers and non believers question themselves. There are some very insightful explanations in the movie that can explain why many believers are considered hypocrites plus it shuns true hypocrites. I recommend the movie for any family that wants to share a movie with the whole family. I do not recommend it for little ones who still believe in Santa Claus. Great movie for young teens.

This is more than your typical spoiled child who, through her interaction with the vagrant who is building a manger for the church where he is staying temporarily, does a 180 because of this vagrant's teachings. His teachings positively impact most everyone he encounters from Max, the spoiled child who started out learning about Christmas and associated symbolisms for a school essay and who became a major moral and financial contributor toward paying the fine to save the manger from the City Ordinance requiring its destruction, to the small children to whom he told his version of the Night before Christmas (""The Nativity"" as God's visit) at which the parents and other adults from the community gathered, to the City Hall Meeting where the fate of the manger was supposed to be determined and where Jes delivered another powerful message centering around God's intention of peoples' belief in him to be a choice.  That is why Jesus was born the way he was, quietly in a manger.
There are a lot of other messages pointed at society in general; food for thought.  Excellent movie. I have ordered several DVDs to share.",1418601600,,1266,4.820276497695852

Everyone I have given a copy to has watched it at least twice in a row.  It is THAT good.  NOT preachy.... but a look at the Christian faith and Christmas in a way that is down to earth and very warm and fun.

The topic has been covered pretty thoroughly I think. I wouldn't recommend that Christian producers waste their time beating this horse. The young heroine, portrayed by Christina Dawn Fougnie, in this story was a little doll. She definitely stole the show. Jefferson Moore was his usual steady workhorse as Jesus. The rest of the cast was solid. I  had chills go up my spine a little bit at the end as tears came to my eyes. This definitely is a keeper. You might want to get this and store it with your copies of Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, so you can watch the all every Christmas.",1368403200,,755,4.510948905109489

5195028,5,B008YYSEN4,"Single mom, Stacy, is facing a Christmas that is quickly being overshadowed by two things. First, her precocious 'tween daughter, Maxine, is determined to ignore Christmas completely. As Max puts it, ""My birthday isn't on Christmas. Christmas is on MY birthday!"" On top of her family's birthday/Christmas dilemma, Stacy has also been tasked with organizing the office Christmas party. Unfortunately, political correctness has won over the office and the event name and focus has been changed to ""Winter Gala."" It's enough to make everyone wish that Christmas had never happened at all.

Things begin to change when a drifter named ""Jes"" shows up at the local church and begins to construct an elaborate nativity scene on the front lawn. Through Jes' hard work and gentle teachings, Max, her mom Stacy and the whole town are reminded of the TRUE meaning of Christmas.

The Perfect Gift is not your usual Hollywood big budget production. The video quality is decidedly lower quality than normal and some of the acting is way over-the-top. In the end, however, these lower budget faults don't distract the viewer from a wonderful feel-good film. When the locals take a stand to protect the nativity scene and mom Stacy demands that the office gathering actually be called a Christmas party, The Perfect Gift reminds us all of the TRUE meaning of Christmas.

5195052,5,B008YYSEN4,Since I am rating this I should say it is right up there with the Left behind movies and The Passion of the Christ. It really touches home and make you realize you believe in him but put the question in - Do you believe he can be a true person in your life? How totally Awesome it is to know because you know but how much more awesome is it to know because you have had an encounter with the one and only Lord.

We sat down and she admitted she had only heard it while cooking, so it was new to ""see"" for her too. The next morning, she came downstairs and found me watching it again. I couldn't believe how PERFECT it was, so I looked it up on Amazon, not believing such a great movie would be available, but there it was. Knowing how much I'd want to loan it out, I purchased two copies. One to keep at home and one to loan to friends. This is BEYOND awesome. It is Godly. Must have for any Christian video library.

It shows how the presence of Jesus can transform lives as we see Max changing from a precocious brat to a charming little girl who can love and give and loves Jesus. The film challenges us to think about the real meaning of Christmas and leaves us with the ultimate truth that God came in to this world because of His love for each one of us.

5195115,5,B008YYSEN4,"A wonderful and heartwarming tale about the true meaning of Christmas!  The story helps us see the birth of Jesus by illustrating its true message - that consumerism and materialism should not be the main reason we celebrate, but that God's gift was given freely and without fanfare or cost.  That's what made it perfect.

A good old-fashioned family movie with none of the negative qualities we so often see in films today.  The actor who plays Jesus did an excellent job portraying Him as a simple human being - someone to whom we could easily relate.  A strong buy recommendation, and a must see!",1264809600,,599,4.666666666666667
5195116,5,B008YYSEN4,"Third of the ""perfect stranger"" movies. Gave for Christmas Gifts and everyone really enjoyed this DVD. The real meaning of Christmas is ""Christ"" - God's precious gift!

Sometimes I get upset with the commercialism and greed of Christmas and this opens up the reality of Christmas and the personal desire Jesus has to communicate with us - He loves us wants our fellowship!",1264032000,,372,4.904761904761905
5195117,5,B008YYSEN4,"This was a very touching film on how the world discounts what Christmas is all about!  That the world doesn't look at Christmas being the birth of Christ but Santa Claus, shopping, recieving gifts, parties, etc.  As the slogan says, ""Jesus is the reason for the Season!""  I also love this film as Jefferson Moore has continued to play the part of Jesus in a modern day(as in his other films Stranger, Perfect Stranger & Another Perfect Stranger) setting to help encourage and show people God's love in their daily lives and to lead them to trust in Jesus with their lives.",1262822400,6,572,4.588235294117647
5195118,5,B008YYSEN4,"This is a great family film that serves as a timely reminder of the real meaning of Christmas. One of the main characters, a tween named Max discovers that Christmas is more than just the day she celebrates her birthday (she was born on Christmas) and that the meaning of Christmas is more than just seeing how many gifts you can receive and whether or not you'll receive the fancy birthday cake you want.

The actors were great and work well together (if you've seen the phenomenal movie ""Clancy,"" you'll recognize some of the key cast members). There was no objectional material and I would highly recommend this movie as a traditional Christmas film for the entire family. I have added The Perfect Gift to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog. A definite must-see!

5195119,5,B008YYSEN4,"This is not the usual low-budget, predictable Christian formula movie of the past. I just bought my copy, which will become part of our Christmas tradition for years to come. Jefferson Moore has a gift for story-telling. His trademark portrayals of a gentle, wise, mildly rebellious Jesus are deep enough for an experienced theologian, but accessible to every viewer. In this addition to the Perfect Stranger franchise, Moore changes a town's opinion about Christmas -- teaching them to value the spiritual aspects over the commercial values espoused by the town council. Along the way, a troubled teen's heart tranforms from bitter self-absorption to charitability and joy. As in Moore's other movies and television series, Jesus does not lecture or pontificate -- in fact, he also ""hates religion""!",1261872000,13,800,5.307086614173229
5195120,5,B008YYSEN4,"I am head over hills in love with this movie!  My family watched it twice this Christmas season and plan to watch it more.  What a blessing to watch a movie about the tranformative power of Christ in our lives and about the real reason for celebrating Christmas-not about gifts or money but about the birth of our Lord and Savior!  I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially those with children.  This is a great, great movie!",1261872000,13,436,4.551282051282051
5195121,5,B008YYSEN4,Forget Santa and his elves; go for the real meaning of Christmas with this enjoyable but meaningful Christmas movie.  The Perfect Gift will leave you feeling a warm connection to God as well as your community.  It fits perfectly in a time where society is trying to keep Christ out of Christmas.  This movie is for all ages and one that you will remember and want to watch no matter what time of year.,1261872000,2,401,4.391891891891892
5195122,5,B008YYSEN4,"This is an absolutely amazing movie and truly puts you in the real Christmas Spirit.  On a whim I felt like going to see a movie so I looked up our theatre on the internet to see what was playing.  I saw that this was playing and mentioned it to my husband.  He told me that it was filmed locally (here in Louisville) by a man he works with and that there were several local actors in it, so we decided we'd go check it out.  I was completely surprised at how good it was.  The story is just so precious and Christine is such a great little actress.  I was so thankful to see a Christmas movie that actually talked about Jesus and His love, rather than just the typical secular Christmas messages that circulate this time of year. Although a lot of secular Christmas movies talk about Christmas being about love and sharing with family and loved ones, none mention where this love originated from and why.  I want to own this DVD so that I can watch this movie year after year.",1261872000,24,977,4.248648648648649

I should add most of the kids were TEEN BOYS!!,1259971200,15,382,4.696969696969697

Be sure to listen for the brilliant analogy comparing a birthday party to Christmas; it really made me think.  This is a movie to be enjoyed with the whole family, at any time of the year.
