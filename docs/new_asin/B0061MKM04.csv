The ending was not my favorite as I feel the story line could've done something bigger. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.",1482883200,,277,4.450980392156863
8490870,4,B0061MKM04,"Mostly, when you glance at Indian cinema's box office at any given moment, it seems that the same actors are featured time and again. So my head's easily turned when a Bollywood picture presents a cast of fresh new faces. Don't let the Yash Raj label lull you into thinking this one's one of them patented romantic tearjerkers. MUJHSE FRAAANDSHIP KAROGE's approach is light and contemporary and youthful. It's the Hindi take on YOU'VE GOT MAIL (which, in turn, was a remake of 1940's THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER).

Deception, assumed identities, and the almighty Facebook flourish in this breezy romantic comedy. With a surprisingly short running time (for Indian cinema) of 105 minutes, MUJHSE FRAAANDSHIP KAROGE tracks the lives of four university students. Rahul Sareen (Nishant Dahiya) is literally the campus rock star, his songs penned by his friend Vishal Bhatt (Saqib Saleem). Malvika Kelkar (Tara D'Souza) is the glamorous fashion design student who lives with her best friend Preity Sen (Saba Azad), the cranky school photographer.

Now put out the musical chairs. When Vishal becomes smitten with the gorgeous Malvika, he thinks his only shot is to pass himself off as his rock star pal Rahul. He accesses Rahul's Facebook profile and extends a friend request. Malvika, reading this, thinks it a desperate move. But Preity thinks Rahul is cute and accepts it for Malvika on the sly. So now Vishal as ""Rahul"" and Preity as ""Malvika"" are chatting online and getting along famously. Who says love can't be based on lies?

It's too bad that real life has to intrude. To celebrate the college's impending 25th anniversary, Vishal and Preity, two strangers, are partnered together for a project. And unlike their fake avatars, Vishal and Preity are instantly at each other's throat. It doesn't help that Preity is a bit of a social pariah and Vishal is an incorrigible prankster. That's not a good blend.

In terms of its hip, modern-day flavor and its watchability and how slickly it's presented, MUJHSE FRAAANDSHIP KAROGE reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaane-Tu-Ya-Jaane-Na-2-DVD-Set-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-Hindi-Film/dp/B001IDMLPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na (2 DVD Set) (Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema / Hindi Film)</a>, although JAANE TU... is better. Both films present a young and lively cast that can hold the viewer's interest. The two leads, Saqib Saleem and Saba Azad (who is a natural), are a riot, and you just smile at their constant bickering because, veterans of cinema that we are, we know where this is going. I like that there aren't any bad guys, that the real Rahul and Malkiva aren't portrayed as shady and conniving. Nishant Dahiya and Tara D'Souza, playing those secondary roles, turn in performances that are engaging enough that you end up rooting for them, too. In fact, for a while, it's not clear who would end up with whom. Maybe the only knock I have is that the denouement comes off as a bit too abrupt, not that it ruins the film. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Story of MUJHSE FRAAANDSHIP KAROGE"" - the four leads sit down for an informal chat as they go over the film's premise, laugh about the bikini gag played on Prabal Punjabi (who plays ""Hacky""), and comment on kissing, Facebook poking, and other topics (23 minutes, mostly in English)
- ""Making of the Songs"" - ""Dheaon Dheaon,"" ""Baatein Shuru,"" & ""Uh-oh, uh-oh"" (13 minutes)
- 5 Deleted Scenes (totaling 8 minutes, no English sub-titles)
- ""Fraaandship for Dummies"" - With Facebook playing such an integral role in the film, these tongue-in-cheek promotional clips feature the cast offering advice regarding social networking protocols
- Theatrical Trailer",1331424000,3,3771,5.173770491803278

This is by far the best Bollywood movie I've seen in a long time. Compared to other Bollywood movies I've seen they all tread along the same lines of avoiding topics that aren't ignored here; sex, porn, drinking, going out and being a young adult in the world! They either do not of that or it's all the characters do (and pay for it later).
Thankfully that isn't ALL this movie is about but they are admitted, which I find to be a major plus because it makes the characters even more relatable as people. People are real here. You love some, you hate some, and others are those crazy characters you know in your own life.

Along with saying there aren't many walls that go up which can't be torn down because of culture. If you watch Bollywood movies hopefully you'll know what I mean..

While I enjoy this movie it is about meeting someone online through Facebook, a very ""modern"" unoriginal idea that can really only go one way. An idea that will not be timeless and once it's time passes it will be a joke. Enjoy it while you still can. Because it's worth a watch!

Let it be noted that I love young adult, coming of age, finding young love type stories. I am very happy that 'youth' India movies are being introduced to the world. I gave it a 4/5 only because of Facebook/Friend Request theme. ""It was tacky but effective!""",1331078400,,1404,4.371647509578544
