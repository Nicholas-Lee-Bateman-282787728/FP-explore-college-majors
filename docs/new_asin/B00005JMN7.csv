1492035,5,B00005JMN7,"I agree with the others.  Why isn't The Wonder Years on DVD?  It should be on DVD.  It's a perfectly themed show that was run for some years.  I was about the same age as the character Kevin when it was out and I love the whole throwing the apple across the cafeteria scene.  I recently purchased the Dawson's Creek Season One DVD set just to catch the couple episodes I missed since at the time I was very busy with work, college and life.  After watching the first season I bought the Series Finale disc I really got more into the story as a whole.  Now I'm hungry for season two and three... (that I can watch on my schedule). So The Wonder Years would help bring out the Wonder on my years in the 80s.  I really believe it could be even more appreciated now.  Double benefit:  It's a vintage 80's tv show classic about the 60's.  Could be one of the best ideas for a DVD Box Set.",1067817600,5,883,4.105263157894737
1492036,5,B00005JMN7,"While the complete version of a lot of TV series have been available in DVD, why has this not come out yet?  For YEARS I have been checking amazon.com and other major DVD outlets for signs of their appearance.  No luck so far.  Out of the top 5 TV series I like, ""Wonder Years"" is the only one that has not appeared in DVD format.  Why?  Why?
TO THE PRODUCERS (If you are reading this): I solemnly promise before you, and the millions of amazon.com customers, that I will purchase the complete set of DVDs of Wonder Years within 1 week of the release date, no matter what the price is (I only hope that they are reasonably priced).
To the uninitiated: ""Wonder Years"" is a story of a young teenager (Kevin Arnold) growing up in a middle-class suburb in the late 1960s.  Through the other main characters which include the loving mother, distant father, annoying older brother, nerdy but kind best friend, and most importantly, his first love (Winnie Cooper), we accompany Kevin as he encounters new social situations at school, trials in father-son relationship, ups and downs of teenager love life, awareness of puberty and early adulthood, etc.
We all have our moments during teenager years, and as we grow older we often look back with a smile and fondness, or sometimes, regret.  But usually, our adult experiences answer the ""why"" questions we grappled with when we were young, and give closure to some of the growing pains.
That's what the series is all about: trying to find meaning and closure of teenage experiences.  Every episode features an interplay between the teenager Kevin and the adult Kevin voiceover reminiscing over his teenage episodes.  So many times we find Kevin struggling over with similar issues during our teenage years, and the voice over sometimes give a new and heart-warming perspective.  That's what I love most about this series.
Cannot wait to view ALL episodes again in DVD.  So, producers, PLEASE.... PLEASE.....!",1064966400,375,1950,4.843373493975903

1492039,5,B00005JMN7,"What made ""The Wonder Years"" extraordinarily brilliant was its ability to affect its viewers with virtuous poetry that put them on a path back through their own journey of adolescence. It captured the affection of growing up so precisely and it never shied away from the truth behind reality. Neal Marlens and Carol Black weren't just geniuses, but earnest writers who knew what it felt like to grow up during a time when the world was under significant change. ""The Wonder Years"" holds a piece of truth with any generation growing up with the show. It was able to go beyond the era of the 1960's and capture the true meaning of what it felt like to be young with wonder. If you were to not release ""The Wonder Years"" on DVD it would be a stab in the back to everyone's adolescence.

1. You can buy it from Amazon for (as of this writing) almost $400. (Waste of money)
2. You can buy it from Time Life for $250 or $300 with the ""experience."" (115 episodes at $2.17 per episode minimum)
3. You can watch it on Netflix with some alternate music (Assuming you watch it in 2 months, about $0.014 per episode). Netflix also has a nasty habit of taking shows off streaming without any notice, so it's best to finish shows before the end of a month/year.

Considering the first season is only 6 episodes and the second is 17, I'd say you're getting 5 full seasons for $50 a season with all the bonus features (over 23 hours) free. That doesn't seem like too steep a price for this great show, but the choice is up to you. Whatever you do, don't pay more than the Time Life prices. I personally will stick with Netflix for now.

The Review:

Such an amazing show and finally, with most of the original music intact! I have been waiting for this to come out for the longest time and had given up hope because I figured that it would be too costly to clear all the great music that went into this amazing show. Thankfully I was wrong. This set costs $250 for something that's in a DVD format but I understand why and was willing to purchase it regardless.

Granted the quality isn't HD sharp and the audio isn't super crisp but that actually lends it the very quality that brings me back to when I watched the show on analog TV as a kid that was just a couple of grades behind Kevin Arnold and practically grew up with him through the formative years of jr. high and high school. As I'm watching the show now, I find myself transported back to my pre teen and teen years and reconnecting with the feelings from that age, conjuring up wistful memories. At the same time, now that I'm much older, I'm also able to relate to the adult characters on the show, something that I wasn't able to do back when I was a kid of course. Either way this is truly a show that has me still look back... in wonder.",1422057600,2,1327,4.3

The $250 price tag is worth every dime.  It's literally like a time machine both to the 1960's when the show took place and the late 1980's/early 1990's when the show was originally broadcast.

I'd forgotten just how wonderful this television series was. Watching the first few seasons (I'm up to season 3 now), I was transported to a magical time in history. Everything about this show is reminiscent of a special time of my own childhood. Yep, this truly was the ""wonder Years"". The acting by all cast members was awesome and the scripts ran the gamut. I think the music alone is reason enough to make this set a must-have. While some have complained about the picture quality, I have to say, it's perfectly fine. True, it's not high-def, but the so-called ""graininess"" is much exaggerated in my opinion. I think Star Vista did a great job of packaging this long-awaited set and I am honored to own a copy.

1492185,5,B00005JMN7,"The Wonder Years is one of the most requested titles by DVD collectors. That's because the musical elements were a seminal part of that series, to set both the time and the mood, and the music rights for home-video release proved too complicated and expensive to acquire. But recent DVD releases of Freaks and Geeks, Veronica Mars and other series have proved that fans will pay extra for the original music, so this new Wonder Years set has acquired most of it. Not all, but the vast majority, and more than 100 of the 115 episodes are presented with all of the songs intact. That's fabulous news. And the even more fabulous news is that The Wonder Years holds up so beautifully in every way. It stars Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold, a teenager coming of age in the late '60s and looking back on his life 20 years later in a narration provided by Daniel Stern. The Wonder Years set includes lots of extras and comes packaged in a miniature school locker with loads of goodies -- but for me, the episodes are what matter, and it matters that they're presented so lovingly and so relatively complete. Now, I just wish I could tell you these episodes were all cleaned up, restored and look better than ever.  But, I'd be telling you a huge lie.  The pilot is in pretty rough shape.  The rest of the episodes appear to look just like a broadcast rip from the clearest pair of bunny ears in 1988.  Its pretty grainy and there isn't much in the way of detail.  Its watchable, but is a rather major disappointment in its appearance.  As goes, the more recent the episode, the better the picture quality on it. Like the video, the audio doesn't seem to have been fully remastered either, but fares much better.  Its a loud track and is pretty clear.  There is some balance issues here an there with blending effect, voice and music together as they don't sound saturated and sound as if they're playing as one.  Its not that bad, but its present.  Some light peaking and distortion in light intervals occurs as well.  This is a fully listenable track and many won't care or notice these things, but they are present. This is it, I'm not sure you're getting another series collection of The Wonder Years from here out.  While I'm disappointed in the presentation, the episodes are still very watchable and I think most will just be satisfied they can have them. I don't think many a buyer is going to be truly disappointed in this set.",1415923200,7,2424,4.5091324200913245

By the way, the series was shot on 16mm, transfered to tape (for editing) and LOOKS
like it did back-in-the-day for its original telecasts. The picture has a soft-focus BECAUSE
of the background. Remember all the background is supposed to be twenty-year-old stuff,

STILL can see those mountains the helicopters fly over in the background of *M*A*S*H*...

The packaging is a perfect recreation of a public school locker and looks great on my DVD collection shelf.  As I work my way through the episodes (this series is a great ""binge-watching"" pleasure) I am struck by how the producers hit so many of the emotional peaks and valleys of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Political turmoil, the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, women's rights, and the day-to-day churn of school friendships and relationships are all seen and experienced through the life of the Arnold family.  I particularly like the way ""life lessons"" for Kevin, Winnie, and their friends are learned in unexpected ways.  The Wonder Years entertains, but it also makes you laugh, cry, and think.  The new ""extras"" here are all worth viewing: a recent cast reunion, interviews with the cast and many others involved with creating the series, and featurettes on the music and politics of the times.

1492240,5,B00005JMN7,"The Wonder Years: The Complete Series contains all 115 episodes of the whimsical comedy series that ran from 1988 to 1993. The show is a look at growing up in suburban America of the 1960s through the eyes 12-year-old Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage). In 1968, Kevin is just entering Robert F. Kennedy Junior High School. Vietnam protests, Beatles music, and Americas space program dominate the era, but Kevins concerns are closer to home. His teenage brother, Wayne (Jason Harvey), delights in torturing and humiliating him. His older sister, Karen (Olivia dAbo), is concerned with social protest. Mom and Dad (Alley Mills, Dan Luria) often seem out of step with Kevins world, and his workaholic Dad usually comes home tired and scowling. An unseen adult Kevin (Daniel Stern) narrates.

The show deals with Kevins relationships with family, friends, dates, teachers and other adults. Fitting in at school is a challenge for Kevin, ever hopeful that fellow student Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) will be his girlfriend. He shares his angst with nerdy, allergy-ridden best friend Paul (John Saviano).

During its original run, The Wonder Years was one of the most popular shows on TV, achieving a spot in the Nielsen Top 30 for four of its six seasons. The show won an Emmy for Best Comedy Series and, at the age of 13, Fred Savage would become the youngest actor ever nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor for a Comedy Series.

The set is packaged in a small metal locker, a replica of those used by Kevin and Winnie in junior high, complete with colorful magnets to custom design it. Within the locker are 26 DVDs containing every complete episode of the series and 23 hours of specially produced bonuses including the 2014 Los Angeles cast reunion, extensive individual interviews, and 12 brand-new featurettes. Also included is the one-hour finale as it originally aired on ABC in May 1993, including a scene that was deleted from the half-hour broadcasts of the final two episodes. Additionally, there are two notebooks of detailed episode information and production photos, a replica yearbook with signatures from cast members, behind-the-scenes photos, classic show memorabilia, and liner notes written by Fred Savage and series creators Neal Marlens and Carol Black.",1413158400,10,2266,5.1024258760107815
1492241,4,B00005JMN7,"The first thing I said upon receiving StarVista/TimeLife's gorgeous packaging for The Wonder Years Complete Series ($249.99) boxed set was ""this is too beautiful to open."" And I wasn't kidding. It sat on my shelf for days without being touched, eyed from across the room like a glistening trophy too special to be handled. The 26-Disc set comes in a replica school locker (with functioning lock), with magnet stickers for personal customization. On its own it would make for a perfect keepsake and conversation starter. But that would be depriving myself of one of my childhood favorites. The Wonder Years had a profound impact on me and millions of others growing up, but can the set live up to the incredible demand by fans? And does the show still hold up over time?

Well, the answer is ""yes"" and ""heck yes"". Included with the 26 discs are a whopping 23 hours of bonus content, which include the expected number of featurettes, commentaries (including one on Kevin and Winnie's first kiss), and B-roll footage. But you also get the incredible cast reunion (interestingly, it's Jason Hervey who may have had the best post-career). Authentic class binders, notebooks, and other items  will thrust you deeper into Kevin Arnold's school experience during the turbulent '60s and '70s. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into the entire package. While the remastering isn't perfect, that nostalgic ""home movie"" quality remains and looks terrific. Nearly all 300 classic rock tracks have been secured to keep the experience as authentic as possible. It must have been a costly effort securing all of those licenses but it was well worth it. Most other DVD packages swap in new music or bland renditions and hope you don't notice, but fans of The Wonder Years would never stand for that here. The music is too essential.

But what about the show itself? I was only eleven years old when the show debuted and I remember it fondly. It was one of the few times I stayed up late because it was after the 1988 Super Bowl, and right away it was obvious The Wonder Years was unlike any other show. Sentimental and nostalgic without being glossy or sugary, the show was brutally tough and instantly relatable. While every kid of a certain age could see something of themselves in Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage), they also secretly wished they could have a best friend like Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and a girl in their life like Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar). Everybody loved Winnie, although I will admit to always having a thing for Becky Slater (played by Danica's sister, Crystal), who memorably punched Kevin in the gut and became his part-time nemesis for awhile. ""Friends? I'll give you friends""! The show was able to tackle serious issues (season four episode ""The Accident"" is still powerful) and show that the problems we face are universal. There's a reason The Wonder Years won its first Emmy after only a handful of episodes. What's a little bit surprising is how well they have held up over the years, especially the bittersweet final episode, presented here in its original broadcast form. Talk about a finale that perfectly encapsulated how daring the past six seasons had been, it was a truly daring move to not give fans the ""happily ever after"" ending we were all expecting. The Wonder Years was a show that touched a lot of hearts, and through this set will continue to touch a lot more.",1413072000,15,3407,4.790816326530612

1492243,5,B00005JMN7,"Its finally here. The one Wonder Years fans have been waiting for. Was it worth the years-long wait? Read on.

As most know, the complete series DVD release was held up for years by music licensing issues. Even with all the negotiations that made this long awaited release possible, it was not 100% successful. More on that later. I also won't be discussing whether or not the set is worth the $250 price tag (You shouldnt pay more, unless of course you want to spring for the personally autographed limited edition which will set you back another 250. As others have noted, there are sellers buying up blocks of them and peddling them to unsuspecting buyers at increased prices, hoping the buyers hadnt seen the Time Life/Star Vista offer). The answer to the Is it worth the money? question will be different for everybody.

The packaging, aside from one issue Ill discuss in a moment, is stellar. The whimsical, yet sturdy steel locker replica holds two three-ring binder replicas containing the DVDs with paperback episode booklets and a hardcover Yearbook featuring cast and crew comments, memories, trivia and great artwork printed on slick heavy stock. Also included is a set of iconic magnets that can be put on the locker. The one issue that could become a potential problem is that the discs fit so snugly in their sleeves that if care isn't taken sliding them in and out, could become scratched. As anyone who has ever experienced a fingerprint or a deep scratch on a DVD completely stalling out a player, this could become a problem. My solution: a ten-dollar CD wallet with plastic sleeves from any office supply store.  I pulled all the DVDs from their original sleeves and simply relocated them to the wallet. Problem solved.

If you're purchasing the set expecting Blue-Ray video quality, youll probably be disappointed. That being said, the video and audio quality are excellent, especially if you are among the unfortunate who unknowingly bought one of the bootleg boxed sets being offered over the years. The video is definitely NOT as bad as VHS quality as one reviewer has stated.  Again, not Blue-Ray quality, but perfectly acceptable.

As stated earlier, the package has been held up this long due to the licensing of the hundreds of iconic pop songs heard in the series. Unfortunately, the resolution of that issue was not 100% successful. There are 14 songs whose rights could not be obtained and have therefore been replaced with other music. Time-Life gets props for being as unobtrusive as they could be in this process. For example, the version of Spinning Wheel by Blood Sweat and Tears has been replaced with another version sung by BSTs lead singer David Clayton Thomas.

Youll find many hours of bonus material, including the cast reunion, interviews with cast members, writers, producers and crew, out-takes, etc.

In conclusion, is the package perfect? No. Is it worth the price tag? There will be a hundred different answers to that question. But, in this reviewers opinion, definitely worth the wait.",1412553600,38,3036,4.916015625

 I remember asking them if it would be packaged like Charmed and possibly get scratched, and they assured me they don't make products that easily scratch. Yea, like the DVD's they use are better than Paramount and other studios lol. My disc's are already scratched to hell, and the video quality looks almost as bad as my VHS that I have. Worst $250 I have ever spent in my life. I am going to return mine, buy the individual seasons in regular cases as they get released, and save over $100. There is absolutely NO excuse for a DVD of this show to look so crappy, when older shows have come out looking damn near perfect. Time Life owes me a drink or something, especially after bending me over and giving it to me like they have",1412467200,7,780,4.335616438356165
1492245,5,B00005JMN7,"Wonderful Classic FINALLY Released!
  I could go on forever about finally owning the authorized version released by Star Vista! First the all, the audio in this release is fabulous! The packaging is wonderful, complete with three booklets, bonus features which end each season and a metal locker complete with magnets that go on the locker which house all of the contents. This is a well thought out project from Time-Life.....ORIGINAL music, FULL screen format which makes this a delight to watch. No commercial bleeps or pop-ups!
  Forget all those BOOTLEG versions out there...if your a die-hard fan of the show , purchase the AUTHORIZED release by STAR-VISTA....you won't be disappointed!. A little pricey but well worth the $$. Songs that simply warm the heart, some that make you laugh, some will make you cry and some you will just enjoy hearing again and again....
  My only problem was trying to get the DVD's out of the packaging, they're a little snug. What I found works well for me is instead of trying to pull the DVD's straight out, rotate them out of the jackets instead,,,,,,",1412294400,4,1092,4.875675675675676

Sellers on here like STEVES VIDEO SALES and THE BEST BUYS, CALIFORNIA SHOPPING CENTER are taking advantage on unsuspecting buyers. Do not pay 379.95 or 299.95 or over 250 for this set. That is insane. Sellers also took advantage of buyers by gouging with the China Beach Complete Series set as well. It is up to you if you want to overpay. Sellers are buying directly from Time Life.

Season One of Wonder Years will be available through Amazon for $17.95 in October 2014. Future individual seasons will be priced at low prices.

I bought this set for 249.95 from Time Life. It is worth every penny since I could not wait (I am a big fan). All 6 seasons and 23 hours of bonus features. As soon as I played disc one, it brought back memories to 1988 after the Super Bowl when the show first aired. Who can forget Kevin and Winnie's first kiss. Paul was allergic to everything. What got me hooked right away was Brian the neighbor getting killed in Vietnam in the first season. The ""Independence Day"" episode was a great final episode. No spoilers.

The information below is directly from the Time Life website:

Never before released on DVD, you can now own the entire series housed in a collectible metal locker like those at Kennedy Junior High (Go Wildcats!). The locker includes two notebooks with detailed episode information, production photos, and all 115 episodes plus over 23 hours of bonus features on 26 DVDs. Plus, you'll get a replica yearbook with behind-the-scenes photos and signatures by the cast and crew. And custom Wonder Years magnets to decorate your locker!

Exclusive bonus features include the first cast reunion in 16 years and interviews with all 7 main cast members, the creators, narrator, guest stars, and many more! Plus, ten newly-produced featurettes and never-before-seen outtakes of Kevin and Winnie's first kiss!

To me the time period doesn't matter all that much, though it was an interesting time in American history no doubt. I wasn't alive in the 60's or 70's but I can easily relate to Kevin and his life because it represents what growing up in suburban America feels like so well.

...StarVista Entertainment/Time Life is planning a deluxe release of the The Wonder Years, which starred Fred Savage, Danica McKellar, Dan Lauria, Alley Mills, Jason Hervey, Olivia d'Abo, Josh Saviano and Daniel Stern, and featured as a theme song Joe Cocker's unforgettable rendition of the Beatles' ""With A Little Help From My Friends.""

""The Wonder Years has long been the most requested TV show yet to be released on DVD, and we're thrilled to have the incredible opportunity to bring this iconic show to its many fans,"" says Jeffrey Peisch, the Senior Vice President, Entertainment Programming & Marketing for StarVista Entertainment/Time Life. ""As we've done with many other classic TV shows, the series will be treated with the care and attention it fully deserves after all these years, with deluxe packaging, robust extras and a lot more. We're really big fans of the series, too.""

As it did for China Beach, StarVista Entertainment/Time Life is painstakingly securing the rights for virtually every song in The Wonder Years. From Cocker's theme song, to hundreds of other memorable and classic soul, rock and pop songs, including classics from The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Smokey Robinson, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and many others, StarVista /Time Life recognizes the necessity to release the series as it was initially broadcast, un-edited and untouched from original broadcast masters.""

1492325,5,B00005JMN7,"my guess as to why it's so hard to release a tv show  with the original music is because the music industry wants to keep the price for licensing high so they can license the music at a higher price for tv commercials, but i've never heard of any one becoming a fan of a musician, or band from a commercial. there is one situation in this show where i've noticed that if the music was changed it would hurt the episode a bit. there is an episode where kevin sister is listening to a jimi hendrix song, and she talks about how great a guitarist he is. if they changed the music it could possible make the sister looks like she has bad taste. even at the end of this episode, if they changed, or stripped out the song ''when a man loves a woman sung by percy sledge'' it would complete change the feeling of the end. i think network tv,cable tv, the movie industry should band together and boycott using any copyrighted music in any future tv shows or movies, and lets see how far artist get without having there music played in tv shows, & movies, or not being aloud to promote the music on television. just imagine if tomorrow networks stopped airing the grammys, billboards awards, or any other program the supports the music industry.",1385596800,,1236,4.373913043478261

1492585,5,B00005JMN7,"Given the number of songs that were used in The Wonder Years, I can understand how music licensing issues have complicated the release of The Wonder Years on DVD. However, surely there is some way to get that issue worked out. This is my favorite TV show of all time. I am the same age as Fred Savage, so when the show originally aired, I was the age of the characters and was going through what they were going through. And even though the show was set in the late '60s and early '70s, it was still very relatable and applicable to my life at that time. And now I am in my 30s, the age of the older Kevin who narrated the entire series. And I can rewatch the show from that perspective now. The whole thing is very nostalgic any way you look at it, but it's more than that. It is a beautifully told coming of age story from start to finish. I'll never forget the episode where Kevin gave Winnie the ring, or when Kevin's math teacher died, or the ""Stout-Hearted Men"" fiasco. There were so many moments in this series that brought a tear to my eye and a smile to my face at the same time. It really was like watching my life on TV--much more ""real"" than the ""reality"" TV we now know. Man! I miss this show! And I always loved all of the music they played at just the right times! And Joe Cocker's cover of the Beatles' ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" was the perfect theme song! Hopefully, the music issue can get worked out and The Wonder Years on DVD will be available soon. PLEASE!",1346630400,,1489,4.173611111111111
1492645,5,B00005JMN7,I am so glad to have access to this series on Amazon Prime.  The series is an treasure and Season 1 is a masterpiece.  Love the values and lessons learned by Kevin in each episode and always find myself getting a bit choked up with sentiment for those wonderful times.  The acting is perfection.  Bravo to Fred Savage and rest of the cast!  Daniel Stern's narration elevates the story to a whole different level.,1343260800,,412,4.513513513513513
1492646,4,B00005JMN7,"Like all the other reviews, I was annoyed to find out that the theme song has been altered. As well as some of the songs throughout the episodes. I clearly remember watching an episode on TV with a Beatles song in the background. When I watched it here (and on Netflix) you get a cover artist.

Besides these flaws, the show is still perfect. You've got Kevin Arnold growing up in the late 60's-early 70's in a small suburb. His older brother, Wayne, the big bully. His sister, Karen, the hippie. And, his parents. Jack (the father) a veteran of Korea, and his mother, the homemaker.

It's amazing watching this show and seeing how the world has changed in such a short amount of time. I was fortunate enough to have grown up in the late '80s-early '90s so I remember a lot of this. Pity that kids today really won't experience the neighborhood coming together for a birthday, national holiday, even a new car! Today kids stay inside and play on the computer.

Sure, the edited versions of this show are not the same that were shown on TV, but it's still great to watch and remember.",1342569600,,1083,4.459595959595959
1492647,5,B00005JMN7,This is still one of the best television shows ever.  They do not portray the 60's and 70' perfectly but they do a good job bringing back the simple and great times living in the suburbs back then.  Even without a lot of the original music it is still an excellent show.  If you want to know what it was like growing up back then this will give you a pretty good idea.,1333670400,,368,4.013698630136986

My children are enjoying shows life ""Different Strokes"", ""Punky Brewster"", ""The Cosby Show"", "" Home Improvement"", ""Little House on the Prairie"", and ""Gilligans Island"".  I am trying to purchase ""The Wonder Years' season one to no avail.  WHY WHY WHY is it not available??  I believe my children would thoroughly enjoy this show!!!

I remember wanting to turn back time and wear my scruffy pants,ride my stingray and read books like I did just a few weeks ago. Instead I was wearing nylons, dealing with 'periods' and trying to figure out white lipstick and black eyeliner and 'teasing' my hair.
Thanks to the music I kept semi-sane!

1492650,5,B00005JMN7,"This was such a good television show.  One of the best.  It would teach people of all ages, and we all need this, the ""Golden Rules in Life"".  It was one of the first sitcoms that let you know that you weren't alone how you felt about growing up perks and problems without a lot of cussing, sexual content, and things that the normal person doesn't do, like going out one morning, and having no experience pick up a job that wants to pay you a huge salary no matter what you do.  Things like having your hair, makeup, wardrobe perfect, the average person doesn't have these things done either.  The show shows you how you get the things that you really need, not everything you just want.  Things like fighting and getting teased by your siblings, and the things that you and your friends say to each other and disagree about.  How your parents really feel about things.  How you should really treat your parents and other people, and about the importance of showing certain people that come in to your life respect and the downfalls when you don't do so.  The shows that come out now are so unreal.  I hope they will release this series soon,  and when they do they need to have a lot in stock because there are a lot, lot, lot, of people out there that want it.",1326326400,2,1263,4.3319148936170215
1492651,5,B00005JMN7,"Wow, it sure is great to have this show available again even if it's only on Amazon.com. I have not seen Wonder Years in about 2o years but it still has the same impact it did back when. I laugh, I cry, I reflect and I think that's exactly what the creators wanted for their audience. Yes, A Little Help From My Friends is not original Joe Cocker version but I can forgive them for that as I understand the royalties are costly. But I was happily surprised to hear many other of the original songs are still intact and thankful for that. Northern Exposure did not fare nearly as well ;(. So thank you Amazon for making this show available. I'm hopeful it will one day find a proper DVD release so I can add it to my collection where it so rightfully belongs.",1325548800,2,758,4.23448275862069
1492652,5,B00005JMN7,"I like many others have been wanting this well known series to be released in a DVD/Blu-Ray format for a while. Luckily, Netflix has released the show in a streaming format but for how long? After a certain amount of time, Netflix ends up pulling some shows/movies from their streaming lineup and then fans will be left wonder yearless once again. I have read many articles that relate the problem to music licensing issues. If that is the case, why not tack an extra $0.99 (the cost of itunes or other similar music services) for every song that appears in each episode to the regular cost of a 6 season TV series price? I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that I would be more that willing to pay for this ""licensing cost"" to bring this series to a format I could keep.

The Wonder Years are from a time before ""reality TV"" and are really missed by many.....as you can tell from the many posts. For now I will keep watching over and over on Netflix until they disappear......",1325462400,2,974,4.411111111111111

Character Kevin Arnold tells of his experiences of growing up in the late 1960s to early 1970s and how they affected him. Along the way we learn about his family including his hard working dad Jack, his mom Norma and his brother Wayne. His sister Karen is the hippie much to the chagrin of her parents.

For a step back in time be sure to watch this award winning well written and acted show.

I've heard Karaoke tracks and Karaoke singers do better.

I was sharing these same experiences that I saw in the tv show every night, and it helped me understand so many things.  I fell in love with the show, and I've been wanting to own it so bad since then.  I have tons of friends who are the same way, and even my father loves this show, as he was a teenager in the same time period that Kevin was growing up.

1492880,5,B00005JMN7,"From the very first episode I knew I would love this show. In the debut episode it is the summer of 1968 and the lead character Kevin Arnold is 12 years old and about to enter Junior High School in the 7Th grade. He lives in an idyllic suburban community in southern California and is growing up in a traditional family structure of a stay at home mom, working dad, hippyish older sister and bullying older brother. Each episode traverses the trials and tribulations of a typical adolescent entering junior high covering various and sundry subjects that a typical 12 year old will experience at one time or another. The show is highly entertaining, very funny and also family friendly as it doesn't have to resort to sexual situations or foul language in its presentation. You can actually watch this show with your parents without being embarrassed which is a rarity in today's climate of filth, open sex and anything goes values. It is also noteworthy to mention that the show is perfectly cast to a tee. Every actor/actress is totally believable in their roles especially Dan Lauria as Jack Arnold, Kevin's father. He should have won an Emmy award for his role at least once in my opinion. It's to bad that there aren,t more shows produced today of this quality and caliber.",1255824000,3,1277,4.705357142857143

  This same music licensing argument was made for Northern Exposure.  My Goodness!  We the consumer (who might spend a few bucks to enjoy re-runs on our own schedule) could possibly enjoy the music again!
  If the artists or the music companies see this as a problem, then lets have them eliminate the consumer from the end of the economic equation.  It will be interesting to see how far they can get without the customer!
  Let's be frank, what we see happening here is music moguls and/or artists thinking they have found another way to squeeze more money out of the consumer's wallets.  In most cases, the music heard on these older shows has already been forgotten.  Consumers have most likely bought it in three different mediums - vinyl, tape and cd.  Why can't they let go of these precious ""ownership/license"" issues when it comes to what is technically background music for effect?
  The series was a TV show!  Let it go!  When we  hears the music, we will probably want to go out and re-purchase the original on cd (if we haven't already).

I always could identify myself with one of the actors (more often than not it was Kevin). I've been waiting for the producers to release the DVDs of the series because I am sure they'll end up doing it at some point. I'm sure it'd sell out in a heartbeat. I just wish we still had REAL TV and not all these ridiculous reality shows and series that don't contribute to our formation as a vital part of society.,1216598400,3,557,3.982142857142857

1493044,5,B00005JMN7,I too am eagerly awaiting the release of the entire series on DVD. I will be one of the first in line to purchase it.

1493045,5,B00005JMN7,I have long thought that there might be someone with some sense. But it seems that there is no sense in the ranks of television. A television show as genuine and as amazing as the wonder years not making it to DVD is a crying shame.

1493046,5,B00005JMN7,"One of the best series ever in my opinion.  Unfortunately one of the things that made it so good is also holding up its DVD release: the great music.  They had so many good songs from so many artists that it is difficult (and potentially very expensive) to get the rights for a DVD release.  Back in the 80s nobody was thinking about getting the music rights for release to video because it just didn't happen then.  Now it is standard to include rights for DVD and internet use in any contract.  I've heard this is a problem for ""Malcolm in the Middle"" as well.",1212278400,,562,4.314285714285714
1493047,5,B00005JMN7,"A lot of people have been asking why this series has not yet been released on DVD.

Back when they started production (1987), the idea of releasing TV series on video (DVD technology was not even commercially available) was virtually unknown. Therefore, the producers bought rights to all that great '60s and '70s music only for broadcast. They did not buy the rights to reuse the music in another medium.

I suspect that a lot of the hold-up is trying to obtain rights to the music for DVD release. And I hope they're able to do it; it just wouldn't be the same old ""Wonder Years"" without the great musical soundtrack.

And I do hope they release it soon. It was one of my all-time favorite series, as Kevin's age and life circumstances mirrored mine almost exactly.",1210550400,3,767,4.583941605839416
1493048,5,B00005JMN7,"I wrote Fox Home Entertainment once again. Unfortunately they are still struggling to receive the cooperation of all the artists, or those who represent their past clients in getting the rights to the music. FHE also said, if they can't get the rights to the music, the DVD set will still be released, but without the music overlay for the artists they couldn't obtain permission. They are determined to get all of the rights they need as they believe as much as we do that the music plays just a big a role as the actual acting did during the series.

I see some of you guys found the HUB channel. If not, check with your local cable/satellite/IPTV provider to see if they carry that channel. They are replaying the entire series in order, and after contacting them, they have informed me that they plan to rerun the series once it has completed due to their ratings during the show time.

Stay vigilant, we will see it come to pass.

This is a quote I found from March 2005

Here is a quoted passage --

""This issue of Entertainment Weekly quotes Fox Home Entertainment's Senior Vice President of Marketing & Communications, Mr. Steve Feldstein, as saying ""We've got it on the schedule, but there are hurdles to clear prior to a firm release date.""

so i open the package and it looks kind of second rate, boy oh boy! it gets worse, i pop the DVD in and what do i see....THe Carol Burnette show. and the labels and cover all say,,,,The WOnder Years.

Shortly after it began to air regularly I began to tell people that this was the best written, best acted, and overall best TV show ever produced in America (Kung Fu, Brooklyn Bridge, and even M*A*S*H notwithstanding).  I got few arguments.  Being a student of film and music, I believe my statement will stand scrutiny.  What Black & Marlens, and later Bob Brush,  produced were five years of short films, some of which were two or three part-ers, each of which could stand alone.  I encourage those in charge to work diligently at securing the music copy rights (I know that foreign broadcasts of the show featured alternate music), because as a musician I KNEW why certain pieces were put in where.  A classic example is Kevin being dumped at the museum by Winnie, then sitting alone as the rain trickles down the bus window, and the buses pulling apart as the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson sings ""God Only Knows"".  It was killer.  ""Why Don't You Stay"" by Bob Seger, as we see Kevin longing for the battered Winnie after a car accident, is another example.  So get the music rights, and PLEASE prepare this series for release.  I would recommend not just individual season boxes, but also a full series box.  And if you can include the Biography special from 2003, many of the show's fans will find completion in their TV-watching lives (and growing-up years).

When Wonder Years did arrive I could relate to the show very well, reason I beleive it was close to home with the story lines. Back in the 1960's our fathers were more distant, the concerns back than was being a good provider for the family, and working out the problems around the discipline required for the children.  Feelings towards the wife was alittle more secret and kept away from the children alot more than now, and yes the children knew just what was expected from them.  During the show's running it covers the Vietnam War, they were real bad heart breaking times, loosing so many of our wonderful loyal men, who fought in this cruel war, the show covers this, and you really do feel the loss, in this show.  The mums in the 60's were busy keeping the husband happy and children, a hard role to have to keep a balance on, again this show picks up on that very well.  I really can not understand why this has not come forward on dvd, are we afraid of what we once had?, even in today's world this show has so much to offer our current families.

There have been several, good, long-running TV shows (and others that should never have seen the light of day) over the years that are now out on DVD.  However, ""The Wonder Years"" was like no other.  To this day, when I think back on the show, and what it meant to me at that time in my life, it's like a hug from an old friend.  I want my kids to be able to experience this show. It's nice when you're growing up and you feel that you can relate to someone else's trials, embarrassments, mixed emotions and all of the stuff that you have to endure as a kid who's coming of age. It is the last of the ""good wholesome family shows""!

Please bring back ""The Wonder Years""!!!!!",1147824000,6,738,4.169014084507042
1493425,5,B00005JMN7,"I grew up in the 80s but my Wonder Years were in the 90s.  Still, I can remember watching reruns on Saturday mornings at a time when Saturday Mornings still had a lineup worth getting up for.

The Wonder Years is a part of what some may consider the last vestages of human decency.  I think it's more like the last vestages of human decency as portrayed by Hollywood.  As others have pointed out, the majority of todays programing is indeed substandard.

The character Kevin was a well meaning individual who was struggling with the pressures of growing up.  Dispite some occasions where he acted before thinking, he was very considerate of other peoples feelings and I have to admire him for that.  Of course if he wasn't at his best, he had Winnie to keep him in line.  Face it, who didn't fall in love with Winnie Cooper.

It was tragic how Kevin and Winnie kept falling in and out of love with each other, but what I wouldn't give to have had the kind of ongoing relationship they had when I was a kid.

This is the kind of programming that keeps our emotions in check.  When you've finished watching an episode you have to stop and take a few breaths because you've almost become a part of the show.  You feel for the characters.  The ingenious web of emotions in each episode leave you feeling a mixture of excitement, confusion, and love sickness.  And strangely enough leaves you wanting more.

I would like to see The Wonder Years on DVD so I can show my future children what values really are.  All this new programming is causing people to become apathetic.  We don't want to become like the society in ""Equilibrium (2002)""",1147737600,4,1634,4.4847457627118645

The biggest slap in the face is that fact that the re-runs of the show aren't even being shown anymore. I haven't seen any for a few years.

My favorite episode would have to be the last episode.  It doesn't get any better than that.  Unfortunately, I've only seen that episode one time.  Several years ago the last episode was on but the cable went out halfway through the episode, much to my chagrin.

If an agreement can't be reached for a particular song it must be changed and studios have learned that doing this too often earns the wrath of devoted fans who do not want songs changed or altered -- just check the outrage over some changes that were made on ""Northern Exposure"" DVD sets, or do a web search with the terms ""WKRP"" and ""Nick at Nite"" if you need confirmation of this.

I've read so many reviews 'bout this show from all over the world.(Mainly the U.S. though :) ) Guess, Zero reviews by Koreans. So, here I am. Sure. I like other TV shows, too : Frasier, Moonlighting, Friends, Seinfeld, ...etc. But, The Wonder Years is the best in terms of 'quality' + more.  I used to be, No. I still am the biggest fan of The Wonder Years here in Korea. The moment I saw this show on TV back in the late 1980s, I instantly fell in love. The script was so heartfelt, witty & realistic. Acting & directing, all other production stuff were marvellous. I did buy the whole box set of The Wonder Years CD Soundtrack on Amazon here (It's not released in Korea.) to let me reminisce of every brilliant scene of this show. Later, I also did collect [buy] all (literally) of the beautiful music  which were included on the show's each episodes(Can you believe that? Well, I can believe it...) ; From Simon & Garfunkel's to ""The Natural"" Soundtrack. - This movie's theme was played on the Series Finale, as we all fans do remember! I of course did tape all the episodes on tapes from TV ; The Korean dubbed version + The Original English version. However, the quality has been faded out due to over and over..., you know. A DVD release of this show should be done. It's a destiny, guys. There are surely Korean fans of this show too, you know. Even though, this show was 'bout the growin' up in the 1960s of America, the premise of the show 'bout life, family, relationship, school life, teachers & friendship is a well-illustrated universal language for whom to be able to recognize its value of the quality show. I used to get teary eyed while I was watching ; When Kevin's math teacher had passed away, Winnie moved to another town & The final episode... and many more.

1493750,3,B00005JMN7,"Staring Fred Savage, this series took a sentimental view of what growing up in the 1960's theoretically was like.

Despike obvious 'now' hairstyles (Norma Arnold has very low hair for the era and the guys hair is waay too long in the early 1960's for strait-laced middle class America), this series was interesting. The-now adult Kevin Arnold (whom I am supposed to believe is roughly around the same age as my parents) voices the introduction to each episode.  The series is a flashback to his childhood.

Yet, because the lessons learned are timeless---this tequnique is not sanctimonious or preachy.

Viewers cannot help but like Kevin's boy-next-door charm and the enduring friendship of Winnie (Danica McKellar) and Paul Pffeifer (Josh Saviano). Even before Kevin experiences generational tragedies (Vietnam...etc) he deals with a horrible older brother named Wayne (Jason Hervey) who will not stop pestering him and a dad (Dan Lauria) who rules the roost.

Kevin also has an older hippie sister named Karen (whose bohemian ways befuddle the suburbanite and conservative Arnolds) but her character is underdeveloped. Because the theme of this series is that some things really are timeless, the conflict is primarily on Kevin and Wayne.  Wayne always has a smarmy wisecrack whenever Kevin does something.",1098921600,5,1309,5.299516908212561

In my humble opinion, 'The Wonder Years' is one of the finest, innovative, observant, and heart-warming television shows...ever. Full stop.

Although a thirty-something viewer from the UK, I can easily identify with the trials and tribulations of Kevin Arnold and Co growing up in 60's / 70's American suburbia, as they accurately reflect the highs and lows that beset most teenagers at some point in their lives. And it's this 'honesty' within the show that makes it such compelling viewing, because it's like watching part of your childhood unfold before you on the television screen.

Carol Black and Neal Marlens have created 24 carat television gold with this series, and the subsequent producers, writers and directors have crafted it into a thing of enduring beauty and wonder.",1092614400,26,1002,5.066666666666666

I must say that the first time I ever saw the Wonder Years I must have been 10 years old and let me just say, I instantly fell in love with it.  I surely hope they make a DVD box set of The Wonder Years--GREAST SHOW OF ALL-TIME!  I can remember when I first saw the episode when Kevin Arnold was younger and wanted to play tackle football after school with his friends but his mom wanted to take him shopping.  He got mad one day and told his mom (Norma) that he hated shopping and just wanted to play football.  When he came home that night with a bloody hand, his mother had forbide Kevin to ever play football again and his father (Jack) agreed with his mother!  AHHHH I LOVE THAT EPISODE.  The other good one was when the Arnolds were vacationing at the Lake with Paul and his family.  It was so funny when Paul, who has braces, was caught with chewing gum in his wallet and was grounded by his mother.  HAHAHAHA!

The soundtrack in itself was just brilliant. Bob Segers ""We've got tonight"" playing while Kevin was staring into Winnies room after she got into a car accident brought a tear to my eye.

1494079,5,B00005JMN7,"The critically acclaimed Freaks and Geeks is finally getting a DVD release, and that is fantastic. Now, it's time for the same treatment for one of the most superb examples of television comedy-drama, The Wonder Years. Capturing everything about what it is to be a teenager (in any era, but especially the late 60's/early70's), TWY is simply incomparable, and while you can make comparisons to Freaks and Geeks, the show is in a league of it's own.

It is very important we make ourselves heard. Maybe it will make a difference, maybe it wont, it certainly won't hurt. We need to do our part in order to get this wonderful show out on DVD. Like a reviewer pointed out, I can't think of the possibility of someone who watched this show and not relate to it. I didn't grow up in the 70's, but I grew up with those characters and even now 10 years later I am still touched. This is TV at its best folks. The complete series should have been released on DVD ages ago.",1073952000,,666,4.091603053435114

1494086,5,B00005JMN7,"I, too, share the sentiments of others who have commented:  The Wonder Years should be available in DVD -- the complete series.  It was one of the most well-written TV shows of all time.  It especially meant a lot to me since I grew up in Burbank, California, where it was filmed on Amherst Street.  Each epsiode brings back so many memories of my childhood.  We need more programs like this instead of the poorly-written, thoughtless trash on the networks today.",1068508800,20,463,4.666666666666667

7939987,1,B00005JMN7,"We bought the set to watch it together with my parents, who are visiting, and only speak Spanish. We specifically bought the product because it lists in the details that it contains Spanish audio and Spanish subtitles. We played  several of the DVDs, and we were surprised that none of them had Spanish audio nor subtitles so we couldn't watch them. Seller misrepresented the product by listing incorrect details.",1472947200,,413,4.9855072463768115
7939988,4,B00005JMN7,"I am very happy to finally own this set.  The 249.95 price from Time Life was a bit too rich for my blood, so I tolerated the crappy Netflix option that heinously swapped out most of the music.  I kept looking at this set, wishing it would go down in price so I could own it, and then last week I walked into Costco, and there it was for 129.99.  I am very impressed with the set so far.  All of the original music is there.  The locker/binder container is pretty hokey, but you can tell that some thought went into this set.  I have read a lot of reviews complaining about the video quality of this set, but so far I have no complaints about it.  Between my blu-ray player's automatic upconversion and my panasonic plasma's picture, I am very impressed.  I wouldn't say that it is ""remastered,"" but it looks better than it ever did on the old 22"" console tv I watched it on as a child, and I have to reiterate how happy I am too have all the original music back.

My biggest complaint would be the cardboard sleeves the discs are housed in.  When are companies going to learn that this is an error in judgment for standard dvds!  They simply scratch too easily.  I immediately took all of the discs out and put them in cd cases where they would be safe.  The price of admission here is too high to scratch up the discs sliding them in and out of cardboard sleeves.  Some of the discs inevitably had some light surface scuffing and scratching from their brief time spent in these sleeves, but luckily nothing so extreme as to mar playback.  Minus this caveat, I am pretty happy to finally own the set, and to me it is worth the 129.99 Costco price.",1448150400,4,1648,4.254019292604502

7939992,1,B00005JMN7,"As a series, The Wonder Years was without equal . . . but, you already know that or you wouldn't be contemplating spending several hundred dollars for this set.  I've read the largest cost of this complete DVD set was a result of the monies that had to be paid for the music rights.  Again, anyone familiar with the series knows how crucial and important the music was in any given scene.  I've given this set just one star because of the horrible, scratchy, dark, and small picture we are given to watch.  OK, pay the artists (music, actors, et. al) but why did the company NOT use better source material for the transfer?  MANY television shows from this era are available on DVD (some on blu ray) and look MUCH better than any and all of the episodes found on this set. I wish I could give this five stars, but to be truthful . . . the re-release of The Honeymooners (from 1956) look better than any episode found on this set.  If you like the show, you'll not regret buying it - but you'll ""wonder"" why more care wasn't taken to preserve and present The Wonder Years to a new generation with newer technology.  The show? 5 (plus) stars.  The picture on these DVDs?  1 star.  The extras are fantastic.  Interviews galore.  I REALLY wish more care had been taken to present these in better quality.",1433116800,11,1300,4.393305439330544

This was my all time favorite show, I remember when it first aired I taped each episode on vs for 6 years.. I love the metal lock, the binders the dvd's come in and the Wonder Years yearbook,  the best money in dvd box sets I ever sent.. Believe me i know, i own over 15,000 movies and box sets included..
