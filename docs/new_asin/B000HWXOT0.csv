Kellog, Brand & Root (KBR), based in HOUSTON TX grossed about $39.5 billion dollars on a sole source, sole supplier contract, from the Pentagon. The Bush-Cheney duo of Texas traitors turns war into a profit.  The Pentagon paid AFGHAN TRIBES to hunt down bin laden in the TORA BORA caves and they led bin laden slip away into Pakistan. The way to keep the 'Forever War' going and KEEP the war profits rolling into Texas is to allow the Terrorists to Get Away!  Darling Bush was reading Bible quotes sent with the Daily war reports and simultaneously funneling BILLIONS into Texas.  $100 charged for a bag of laundry washed in filthy water.

The lies, deceit and war profiteering of those close to Dick, George, and Rummy need further attention so as to minimize the likelihood of recurrence.  I read that as of January 2003 over 4,000 private contractors were still in Iraq. Since first seeing this film in 2006 I've viewed it three times. I always left with a very ambivalent feeling.

2643695,5,B000HWXOT0,"If you are properly educated on international affairs, not emotional, you may understand that the USA enters warfare for profit and always has done so. Let's face it - turner their back to Rwanda as 900 000 were slaughtered and they were well informed from days before, but did not allow preventative steps to be taken, or the word Genocide to be used. In Sudan the crisis goes on - and locals get slaughtered. North Korea ""has"" and ""tests"" their new technology and even announces it - but very little to profit from. No interest. If you are not on this side - this film (and my comments) may come across as offensive - and even if we have different views I am not attempting to offend anyone.

Even us whom had hope with Obama stepping in now realize he is just another profiteer, simply more articulate enabling his win of the Nob[le] Speech Prize.

Watch this and have your thoughts evoked. Not sure if it is really true that the US Military pays $45 for a 6 pack of Cola that costs $1.50 here in the Middle East, or that corporations burnt fleets of vehicles and wrote them off as there was nothing to lose, well only for the US tax payers.

2643697,4,B000HWXOT0,"As much as this film is important, it shouldn't be
regarded as this is everything what goes inside Iraq.
It is largely about privatization of the war and what
is going on with these defense contractors such as
Halliburton, KBR, and Black Water. These three are the
most prominent names, but it is quite astonishing that
there are tens of thousands of government contractors
within that nation.

How much can we go on like this, costing us trillions of
dollars, more than 5000 dead troops, and more than a million
dead Iraqis? Is it really the US government's intent to
rebuild Iraq after purging of Saddam Hussein or is it to
use the nation as a geopolitical strategic point in Middle East?
Oil is definitely large part of Iraq and I am amazed that
there are actually people who deny this fact.

The US is on the way to collapse like the Soviet Union, that
is burdened with two major wars that are failing miserably
and trapped with financial disasters that dwarf what happened
in Japan two decades. It is very possible and we are already
witnessing the beginning of the end of the world's largest empire
in history. I just hope we will be able to mitigate some effects
of catastrophe that will inevitably take place by combination of
 peak oil, environmental disasters, economic turmoils,
and loss of liberty and morality.",1250035200,,1323,4.693965517241379
2643698,5,B000HWXOT0,"This is a must see.  Our government contracts out the interrogation and torture of Iraqi civilians to private companies which are not subjected to any sort of supervision, so that the U.S. government can wash itself clean of any ethical misconduct.

2643699,5,B000HWXOT0,"As people looted in the streets of Iraq following the 2003 United States invasion, U.S. Secretary of War Donald Rumsfeld said, ""Freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.""

Perhaps the free-for-all Rumsfeld referenced wasn't Iraq citizens stealing television sets from bombed-out retail stores.  As the documentary IRAQ FOR SALE details, those feeling free to commit crimes and do bad things in U.S.-occupied Iraq are Halliburton, Titan, Blackwater and other contractors with friends in high places, namely the halls of the George W. Bush White House.

Privately-contracted interrogators abuse Iraqi citizens without being subject to laws that would call for a court martial were they U.S. military personnel. Kellogg Brown & Root supplies contaminated water to American soldiers. Halliburton charges $45 for a six-pack of soda pop.  In IRAQ FOR SALE we see the contractors' disregard for anything except profits includes the lives of their own employees, most noteworthy the four Blackwater security personnel who die because the company sends them ill-equipped and under-manned on a dangerous mission.

IRAQ FOR SALE presents a press conference clip where George W. Bush laughs off a reporter's question about military contractor corruption.  Rather than follow up with Bush, the reporter laughs, too, and lets him off the hook.  Of all the accomplices Bush had in his illegal invasion of Iraq, the corporate media are among those with the dirtiest hands.

2643701,5,B000HWXOT0,"We are too lazy, naive, afraid and stupefied to even comprehend what is happening around the globe. If it doesn't affect us directly it's not our problem!! Right? Right!! Anyway people get too stressed when they see and or hear about extremely disturbing things, such as this DVD's context -Economical Racketeering By Big Business!!

Quick Summary:

Impartial governments around the globe look the other way while companies run amuck making ungodly profits from Tax-Payers. Did I mention all whom are ironically friends of government(s) and or were once government officials themselves? The list of neglect (cutting corners; over charging) for the almighty dollar are endless; atrocities that are absolutely prevalent simply go unchecked. Worry about that? Not Me [Joe FreeWorld] we/I cant change anything anyway ...were helpless!!!

Sadly, all of the people/families interviewed in this DVD were uneducated or unaware themselves ~UNTIL~ family members ended up dead or they themselves saw [BIG BUSINESS] up-close and personal. These factions run along side our governments (some never even bid for the job; it's simply given to them) - all involved willing to put [you] in harms way for ""PROFITABILITY""!!! These companies spoke about in this program will never be held accountable for their over spending and or the death-toll to regular Joe's ...not until its too late; then [maybe] a few patsy's will be thrown in jail.

Not surprisingly, it's not a pretty picture. 1 star deduction for OK production quality (but heck, the guy works on a budget)5 stars for content. With these popular and widely acclaimed documentaries Greenwald is clearly providing the American public with what it wants and needs but does not get enough of from it's major media institutions. In recent years the documentary format has become an invaluable counterbalance to a cowed and subservient corporate media fearful of ever present charges of a mythical liberal bias and commited as ever to not really rocking the boat.

In addition to Greenwald's good work, there have indeed been many excellent films made on this war as well as important issues directly related to it. Some highly recommended include:

2643705,5,B000HWXOT0,"A news report today states that the Iraq war will eventually cost the US $2.7 TRILLION. If you are wondering how even a rich a nation can manage to spend so much money in such as small corner of the world, ""Iraq for Sale"" will provide a few answers.

The Iraq War seems tailor-made for profiteering, with its no-bid contracts, cost plus arrangements and obvious conflict of interest between the companies involved and the executive branch prosecuting the war. The film focuses on the involvement of companies like CACI, Halliburton and Titan in providing contractors for the war effort. The film describes contact language experts who can barely speak English. This makes them useless for translating during interrogations, and positively dangerous if they misunderstand what is being said. The Abu Ghraib scandal seems at least partly due to unaccountable contractors calling the shots in a military situation. Shockingly, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski is interviewed in support of the film's premise that contractors contributed to the scandal.

Iraq for Sale shows contractors literally taking work away from US soldiers. The GIs, many who joined the military to learn technical skills, are required instead to train the contractors, who make many times the wage provided to the soldiers. Cost overruns and predatory charging are rife. Empty trucks drive back and forth on Iraqi roads, racking up profits for every useless mile they drive. Because they refuse to run more expensive 24-hours operations, contractors running mess operations deliberately understaff, exposing the resulting long lines of hungry GIs to insurgents who know just when the largest numbers of soldiers will gather. Equipment that is only slightly damaged is destroyed -- literally burned in pits so that brand new replacements can be ordered, increasing costs to the taxpayer and profits to the contractors. The focus on profits may have cost soldiers their lives. Truck convoys run into ambushes for want of decent military debriefs; contractors (like the 4 killed and burned in Fallujah) die when their escorts are taken away to save money.

Iraq for Sale is a powerful indictment of the treasonous, immoral profiteering that masquerades as the US war on terror. It's hard to believe that this stuff goes on, never mind that it is done intentionally. Never mind that it is done with the blessing of our government.",1213315200,,2398,5.2072538860103625
2643706,5,B000HWXOT0,Excellent Documentary!!!  However whomever wrote it CLEARLY went straight after the Government Contractor's!

2643708,5,B000HWXOT0,"This movie should be seen by every politician, and everyone who votes. It tells the sad and scary story of how private companies are ripping off the American people with their warmongering, and their illegally charging for activities they do not perform. For example, a subsidiary of Haliburton, that drives trucks in Iraq, charges for trips it forces its employees to take with empty trucks between cities in Iraq, simply because they charge by the mile traveled. This creates tremendous life threatening risk for the employees, but gets great profits for the company, and does not serve American interests. They frequently do this with empty trucks, and are not transporting empty trucks to the destination because they are needed there, but simply to accumulate the mileage. This situation is attested to by both soldiers, private employees in Iraq, and ones who did work in Iraq and are now back in America.",1206230400,,911,5.039735099337748
2643709,4,B000HWXOT0,"This film is an expose on wasteful spending and lack of accountability of private contractors in Iraq.  It raises several good questions about the way private companies conduct business during war time.  Is there room for profit when people's lives are concerned?  Is our current system which gives allows a percentage of profit for everything they bill encourage wasteful spending?  What's to stop companies from cutting corners to increase their profit margins at the cost of people's lives?

The film lacked narration and interviews with prominent dissident individuals who have some expertise that may have pulled the film together better.  It has a lot of interviews with former employees of contractors in Iraq who are upset and disgruntled about how things were being handled and families who have lost loved ones, combined with people making critical commentary about the situation.  Also excerpts from news broadcasts talking about the very issues the film is talking about.  These provide a kind of evidence and give the films arguments more credibility.

Because the film relies on non-expert interviews, again and again the great crime is that companies are making profits.  Making profits is not a crime per se.  We have to give companies incentive to help over there; otherwise they would just conduct business as usual and make more money doing something else.  The real crime is what companies are willing to do for a higher profit margin and what the human costs are.  This is addressed in the film, but people might get the impression that the film is saying the profits are bad and immoral.

For something that came out in 2006, I thought maybe there would be some discussion about how private contractors might be playing a role in us still being in Iraq.  There are alternative ways to influence politics in Iraq other than direct military presence, through the foreign aid programs and military support.  We overthrew the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, using this type of low intensity conflict.  It's possible that such a campaign might have success in Iraq, but the administration might have some vested interest in a military campaign because of the lucrative contracts it provides for private interests.

2643710,5,B000HWXOT0,"Howdy folks. I am a two time Iraq veteran. In fact I;m typing this from Al Asad, Iraq right now aboard Camp Ripper. Everything this film says is true and it's not even the tip of the iceburg. Everyday I see the Blackwater mercenaries, the KBR crooks, and contractors doing half the work I am for 10 times the pay. Contractors will tell you they love America, they support the troops, and just want to do their part. They are full of bull. They are out here for a year to make $100,000 tax free, then go home to buy a house in cash.

Operation Iraqi Freedom has nothing to do with freedom. This war is all about the almighty dollar and everyone involved is making out like bandits. It is almost to the point where military personnel here are second class citizens while the contractors are VIPs. I have always been against this war and I am sick of this war. This isn't even a war anymore, it's a huge cluster-frig. We're over here dying and away from our loved ones for 12 to 15 months at a time while fat pigs sit back with their cigars and champagne watching their stocks go up.

In all of American history, this is our saddest moment as Americans. Future generations will look back at our time period and shake their heads in disbelief. My only question is how much more money can be paid to these contractors and for this 'war' before we are completely bankrupt?

And if any of you think that one Iraqi is thankful or even wants us here, you're smoking crack. There is a saying they have here in the Middle East and the Iraqi's quote it often, ""We would rather have 1000 years of tyranny than one day of chaos.""",1199577600,,1615,4.305921052631579

2643716,5,B000HWXOT0,"The war dribbles on, hundreds of billions of dollars dumped into the Iraqi sand, over a hundred thousand people dead, millions made homeless, Halliburton stock triples, Bush has his hair styled, Cheney shoots caged birds thrown from the bed of a pickup truck, heroically I guess or ain't it fun to watch the bird bodies splatter?  Meanwhile, somebody somewhere has that ""Mission Accomplished"" banner.  It should go for some serious bucks on Ebay someday.  Karl Rove is writing his memoirs: ""There's a new reality, the reality of power.  Power makes its own reality.  (And I--I!--was at the pinnacle: indeed I was the Power and the Glory.  Myself.  Me.)"" Rumsfeld ditto.  But Rummy writes of ""shock and awe"" and how the generals in the field bungled his best laid plans.  And soon George W. himself will be writing his memoirs.  The advance will be several million.  The lies will probably not exceed that number.

Of course there is no way that I at my computer can find the words to really make clear the stupefying waste and the horrific immorality of what the Bush administration has done in the name that was once America.  Robert Greenwald's documentary does it better, much better by focusing on the profiteering by KBR, Halliburton, Blackwater et al.  He uses the camera to show the images of human carnage, of the weighty mass of trucks and equipment, of Bush administration officials lying through their teeth on TV, of Bush himself strutting, waving, smiling.  There are graphs of profits going up, up, up, street level shots of the stately office buildings of the profiteering companies, silver and glass, sunlight on well-tended lawns.  Condi and Rummy, and Dick and Bush lying, lying, and lying some more.  And for what?  Cheney will be dead soon himself.  Bush will be bored (perhaps to drink), their ill-gotten millions of no value to their dying souls.

I liked the way Greenwald predicted the Blackwater scandal, more or less with his focus.  (You should check it out.)  All those macho guys with their military pensions in their back pockets finding Soldier of Fortune jobs at Blackwater, toting their guns, shooting the enemy in self-defense, making an additional six figures a year.  Pallets of hundred dollar bills forklifted off of military transport planes...

Well, Greenwald didn't get THAT shot (too bad), but he did show EMPTY trucks, a convoy, on an Iraqi highway (paid for as LOADED according to the contract).  The contract of America with Halliburton.  Halliburton with America.  What's good for Halliburton is good for America.  He shows the hundred dollar a meal meals contracted for those inside the Green Zone.  It's surreal and then some.  We airlift the PX, the movie theaters, the gym equipment, the computers, the TVs, the Pepsi Cola--well, actually Halliburton was able to substitute some local Iraqi cola at a fraction of the cost.  We create a virtual reality army base inside Baghdad where our forces can hang out in safety.  Who gains?  Those doing the transporting.

More than any war in history, this documentary shows the influence of privatization.  With no-bid contracts, of course.  Bush hates big government.  The way to reduce government is to make it go broke.  How do you do that?  You create a useless war and sell the contracts to your buds at inflated prices.  It's amazing but this is what has happened.  And Greenwald documents it.

Problem is, this fine documentary will be lost in the vast sea of information that we ourselves are lost in.  Hide in plain sight is what the profiteers have been able to do.  Your stock triples, it's reported on the five o'clock news and in the pages of the New York Times (""our paper, man"") but who can see it amid the myriad details of other stock prices or of the endless parade of other numbers, and words, words, words.  A billion dollars lost here and there.  Pentagon accountants clueless.  Just another story on CNN, spun out of sight by Fox News.

You can watch this without the sound.  The images tell the story.

This is another fine piece of work by Greenwald.  He also directed Uncovered: The Whole Truth about the Iraq War (2003) and Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism (2004).  He does a great job with the visuals, the interviews, and the narrative.

I have one tiny criticism.  No captions.  No English subtitles.  Every film and documentary on DVD should have subtitles.  That way we can be sure of the exact phrasing of the lies.",1193443200,,4450,4.835325365205843
2643717,4,B000HWXOT0,"I was very impressed by this documentary.  I expected another low budget agitprop hit piece with a lot of grainy video, growling synthesizers, and the interviews bouncing between the same three people over and over again.  This documentary actually gives liberals, conservatives, and everyone in between something to really think about without insulting anyone.

So, I was surprised at just how professionally this film was done in all respects, from the editing to the interview subjects and the story that was told.  It was ironic to me that almost to the day I recieve this DVD another major incident involving contractors in Iraq hit the news.

What I appreciated the most was the calmness (for lack of a better word) with which the story was told.  I didn't feel like I was being manipulated by stupid video effects or other propaganda techniques.  Also, this wasn't some knee-jerk hit piece on the Iraq war itself or on President Bush.  It was a detailed and almost horrifying look at perhaps the one aspect of the Iraq war that makes in unique in American military history, and that is the extensive use of contractors hired to work in conjunction with the military.

Furthermore, it wasn't even knee-jerk in respect to contractors in general, but rather picked its battles very carefully with certain contracting companies in certain contexts and situations.

The lessons I took away from this documentary are as follows.

First, multiple chains of command don't work.

Second, there are certain things contractor/mercenaries should never be allowed to do.

Third, if we had a larger military, and could send more military people to Iraq, a lot of the bad stuff in this documentary never would have needed to happen.

Fourth, it's like the Iraqis got to see the best and worst of America at the same time: the heroic soldiers who really belive in their mission, and the ""war profiteers"" who in the worst case seem to care about nothing more than grabbing as much money as possible.

Fifth, if I had to go to Iraq, I'd likely be safer in a military unit than with a contracting company.

Sixth, war is too important to not be left to the generals, generals with enough troops that is.

My only disagreement was with the emphasis on no-bid contracts.  I understand that when an enemy army is defeated and our troops first roll in to hopefully restore order, there just isn't time for the painfully slow formal bidding process that is typically followed when the government awards contracts.  In this situation, if I were the president I'd call my trusty cronies, give them money, and get them to work as fast as I could.  But then of course, there must still me mechanisms to hold contractors accountable regardless of how the contacts were awarded.

All in all, one of the best political type documentaries I've seen.",1192147200,,2824,4.82952182952183

2643724,1,B000HWXOT0,"I bought this product with the hopes of an honest documentary but instead received a very and highly biased DVD of junk.

I am a veteran of both Vietnam and the first Gulf War.  I am also a former military contracting officer, scout sniper, Green Beret, and Test Pilot.

First this docujoke slams privatization but never mentions that Bill Clinton cut the Army from 730,000 to 530,000 his first year in office and just before I retired to 430,000.  Now do you really expect with most of those cuts coming from support and logistics that civilian contractors wouldn't be used?  Please don't be naive.  The coverage of this shortage of skills has to come from somewhere.

Second this National Guard Sergeant speaking about being forced to use KBR for laundry from his chain of command shows just how clueless this individual is of contacting.  What exactly where the contract requirements concerning this issue?  How nice it was this was left out even though it is available on the Internet!

Third the long lines of troops at chow at the same predictable times.  Well excuse me!  What were the terms of the contract, where were the military officers to correct this, and exactly how many deaths/injuries did this cause?  Again not mentioned.

Fourth how about the Democrats that control Congress approving LOGCAP IV for 10 Years....Duh?  Now who is talking out both sides of their mouth?

Fifth the female general grade office responsible for Abu Ghraib prison.  Well general from a retired Army Officer where it the Hades were you at?  Are you or are you not a general grade officer responsible for the conduct of both military and civilian personnel under your command?  Blaming a civilian contractor is a disgrace on you.  You expect me to believe that a Staff Sgt (E-6) and lesser enlisted personnel did this all by themselves without your knowledge or the knowledge of any other military officer?  Perhaps in Disneyland but that insults Mickey Mouse.

Sixth Senator Dodd keep referring to Madam President.  Since when did the current speaker of the house become the president?  The Speaker is referred to as Madam Speaker.  Perhaps Senator Dodd has another agenda not addressed in this DVD.

Seventh $100,000 tax free.  Bull Manure.  It is only $85,000 IF you meet very specific criteria from the IRS.  Didn't the producers even check this data available for free from the IRS website?  What piss poor research and outright bigotry from the makers of this film.

Eighth Soldiers on Guard Duty...Duh can I please have a dime for every damn time I was on guard duty as an enlisted man!!!  Grow up you babies.

Not once during the film was a single reference given as to a source of information. There was not a list of material cited anywhere on the DVD.  One has to go to the web site to find any cites and the cites are to material from 2002 - 2003 which I suspect is four years before the film was made but no date of production is even given on the case the DVD comes in!!!!!

All in all a gross rip off in itself.  It seems the producers are in the profiteering business themselves.  Shame on you to damn someone for what you did to me and other buyers of your DVD.

2643727,5,B000HWXOT0,"A friend of mine recently communicated the need to watch this new documentary by Robert Greenwald entitled Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers. If you've ever been curious on where our tax dollars are going, and why the cost is so dramatically high to fund the war in Iraq, then you need to see this film. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Did you know that our tax dollars are going to large corporations such as Halliburton, KBR (a subsidiary of Halliburton), CACI, and Titan? The reason for this is to outsource jobs to contractors in Iraq to handle many of the daily tasks that our military men and women can handle at a fraction of the cost. Many of these contractors are employed as military intelligence officials such as interrogators and interpreters for the United States that may have no patriotic tie to our country! And many of these contractors lack the skills necessary to fulfill their job duties. Not only have lobbyists helped solidify multi-million dollar deals with the government for these large corporate entities, but they do so at the cost of civilian lives.

These corporations are sending unprotected contractors out into a war zone where many stay. One example of many is how Halliburton sent a group of truckers towards Baghdad to deliver supplies to U.S. troops. They encountered what appeared to be a deadly ambush where some of the men were killed. The atrocity here is that some of the trucks were empty so that Halliburton could overcharge the government on deliveries that didn't exist. And all of this at the cost of human lives in exchange for corporate greed and back door deals with our administration.

After watching this documentary, you may wonder why the situation in Iraq remains stagnant, and why there are so many billions of dollars poured into Iraq. The administration is using U.S. tax dollars to fund their contract agreements. This makes both elected officials and the corporations they work with very rich while draining the life from our own economy, and raising the deficit to unprecedented levels. For a little perspective, we borrow approximately three billion dollars a day from China and other foreign countries just to stay above water.

I've been in numerous conversations with friends and family regarding government corruption, corporate greed, and the lobbying that occurs behind closed doors. I'll often get angry and say, ""Most Americans blindly follow like sheep. They believe whatever they're told by the media or government. Why don't they open their eyes?"" But then I thought for a moment about the action I've taken. I haven't taken any action. I've complained about others, but sit around doing nothing. I'm more guilty then Americans that lack the truth to take action. But just as an outraged Peter Finch yelled in Network, ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" It's time to get the word out there. It's time to start questioning the government, educating people about the truth, and demanding that our government and the corporations that they protect take accountability for their actions.

I think every political party has good and bad ideas, but it's important to remain a skeptic when it involves politics. Don't simply believe everything you're told--especially if told by a member of your own party affiliation, because you'll have to overcome your own subjectivity. Research the truth, question our elected officials, and demand change. You may sit comfortably in your home with a nicely cut lawn, but that could change. And looking back 15 or 20 years from now, you may wonder why you sat back and let things crumble without so much as raising your voice.

What you read above were the exact words that I communicated to every last person I know in a formal email. I essentially copied and pasted it here as a review to demonstrate the sheer power that this film holds, and the actions that you'll likely take as a result of viewing it. It pushes you into action, because by doing nothing, you'll feel an extreme amount of guilt.

2643729,4,B000HWXOT0,"Good feature on the colossal wasteful expenditure on part of the government, the obscene profits generated by contractors (e.g., $80 can of coke, manufactured locally in Iraq), and in general the pre-ponderance of the contractors in all facets of the war. There are more private contractors than government personnel in Iraq - and the documentary shows the immense allure of the goverment personnel to switch sides and join contractors to get paid as much as 6-times of what the government pays (for the same dangers). And it works from the government perspective also since they don't have to account for private contractors killed to the American people.

However, I do realize that like anything pertaining to the government, a war should never be expected to be run efficiently. Some of the basic war requirements like feeding the troops, and taking care of their water supplies and safety should never be handed to non-government agencies.

They are also incompetent. Many translators that were hired could hardly speak English.

One of the most shocking things of all in this documentary is not how many members of congress and the Pentagon are protecting these companies, not how much it's costing us taxpayers to pay for these companies, not how many translators hired can't speak English, not how much these companies are putting our soldiers at risk to make a profit, but the one big thing is that many of these companies (Halliburton included) are given ""cost-plus"" contracts. With these contracts, these companies will have more money given to them with the more money they spend. That means some of these companies will send out empty trucks for no reason, and they will charge US, and make us not only repay all that money but CHARGE US MORE so they can have a profit.

2643737,5,B000HWXOT0,"I thought this was a very interesting film that pretty much elaborated on, and confirmed, what I had already suspected about the Iraq war. This war has nothing to do with freedom and democracy, and everything to do with making more money for the wealthy. It's so very sad to think of all the men, women, and children that have lost, and continue to lose, their lives so that a few cold, calculating individuals can make obscene amounts of money. The people that run our country should be ashamed of themselves for what they have done. But I know they won't be, because they've sold their souls for the almighty dollar long ago, and the only lives they care about are their own. The rest of us are just pawns in a big money-making game. Do you really think it's a coincidence that our Vice President is connected with Halliburton?

But hey, look on the bright side, there isn't a damn thing any of us can do about it. It doesn't make any difference who you vote for or how much you protest, the government will do what it wants. America is run by corporations, not the people. And the goal of these corporations is to make as much money as possible, by any means necessary.

2643739,2,B000HWXOT0,"Having only heard whispers about Robert Greenwald's previous documentary successes (OUTFOXED, WALMART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE, etc.), I finally decided to check out one of his latest ""success"" stories, IRAQ FOR SALE: THE WAR PROFITEERS.

This documentary closely monitors the contracts doled out to private companies who are involved in the Iraq War. Halliburton is hit on pretty heavily and the association it has with Vice-President Cheney. Then there are the Blackwater boys who render privately armed American men for political protection, security and, surprisingly, interrogation. There are companies who wash the clothes for the military (at nearly $100 per bag), furnish food and drink, and even provide fuel tankers for military vehicles.

All of the costs associated with the war come out of the American taxpayer's wallet, and the idea behind the documentary is to make one so furious at the ridiculous costs that they want to quit the war and fire their Senators and/or Representatives. The figures are mind-blowing -- in the many hundreds of billions of dollars.

I will admit that the story points out some terrible flaws in our government's handling of private contracts, and all of the favoritism and bipartisanship that comes with it (almost all of the votes related to private contractors that took place in congress went along party lines).

But the documentary fails terribly in coherency. Running around like a child with ADHD, the film makers seemed to have difficulty following through on any one idea. Halliburton, Blackwater, CACI, Raytheon, DynaCorp, and many other companies are hit upon as abusers/enablers of The Military Industrial Complex. But they're barely touched on and then we quickly move to another topic. It was enough to give viewers whiplash.

There are also small box graphics which have arrows pointing to and from various contractors and people in high level government jobs (making connections to cronyism) but, again, they are shown only fleetingly and are difficult to decipher.

As far as I could tell, too, there was only one attempt to garner information from the other side (a brief encounter with the CEO of Blackwater in a public garage), which makes the entire film very one-sided. We never see nor hear from any higher-ups in these corporations and only view disgruntled employees. If an attempt to interview resulted in stonewalling, I would've like to have seen that in the film, however brief.

I'm not in any way defending these scumbags who overcharge our government (i.e., me and everyone else who pays taxes) or use war as a means to achieve profits. I find that despicable. But this documentary isn't the best way to see that. It's hopscotchy, poorly structured, and difficult to follow.

2643740,4,B000HWXOT0,"In short: absolutly shocking! ...  and also very informative.

Beside the fact that all pieces of evidence shows that the Iraq war was based on fallacious arguments, you will see in this documentary how the US government distributes mandates (2 examples below) amounting billions of dollars, financed from tax payers, to US private firms in order to:

- take over the military logistics and charge soldiers ridiculously higher prices for water, coke or any other food. Food that was cheap or even for free under military hands. Thank you Halliburton!

- run ""intelligence"" on Iraq soil. What does it mean? To torture, yes, to torture any person that ""might"" have information. Who had this ""privilege""? Blackwater is the US private firm that has been awarded the billion dollar contract whereby Iraqis were tortured in the Abu Ghraib prison (under military supervision, of course). What is more astonishing is that the Congress (under Republican hands by that time) voted a law that protects Blackwater (and alike private ""suppliers"") against any prosecution.

Unfortunately, we know that War is a profitable ""business"" for the US military-industrial-congressional complex, as predicted by the 34th U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. Once seen as heroes and worshiped 60 years ago, the Military of the United States is now feared or despised. A military that serves only one value, the dollar, and not freedom as alleged.

2643743,5,B000HWXOT0,"What's the war in Iraq really about?  Is it about helping a country recover from an oppressive regime?  Maybe it's to help establish a new sensible government.  Or could it be about making huge amounts of money no matter what the consequences?  Well, when it comes to private contractors working in Iraq, Kuwait, and other nearby areas, it is definitely all about the money and nothing else.

Just some of the companies getting rich off of the war on terror include Halliburton and its subsidiary KBR (Kellogg, Brown, & Root), Parsons, DynCorp International, Translantic Traders, Blackwater, CACI and Titan.  All of the above contractors bill our government to the tune of over 25 billion dollars and American taxpayers are getting financially hammered for a lot of this cost.

When looked at closely, it is easy to see why the giants like Halliburton get the contracts so easily.  First of all, the higher echelon of company management and ownership is amazingly political and powerful and they seem to be connected with everyone in Washington.  Secondly, there seems to be no competitive bidding (at all) with other companies and Halliburton's business strategies look suspiciously like a monopoly.  Thirdly, when it comes under fire for anything remotely inappropriate, no investigation of any substance is carried out or it is brushed under the carpet.  The program does show some testimony from rare congressional hearings on many questionable issues regarding Halliburton and KBR but absolutely nothing is resolved in any way.

While operating in country in Iraq, as explained in this documentary, there is little if any accountability or oversight concerning company practices of private contractors.  There is a surprising (or maybe not so surprising) amount of fraud, waste, corruption, and abuse that goes on as a normal way of doing business in the war theatre.  There is evidence to suggest that contractors even have a low regard for the safety and well being of their own employees while in Iraq and surrounding areas.  To compound an already detrimental situation, some contractors are there to help support and sustain U.S. troops but the services rendered are inadequate or just plain deplorable.

`Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers', in my opinion, is a well produced documentary that basically sends a message that war is privatized or is becoming that way quickly.

This film exposes the enormity of the profiteering and outright fraud associated with the military/industrial complex.  Of course this is not new.  The same was done during the Viet Nam war.  Where there is war there is profiteering for the few and calamity for the many.

I hope something can be done to stop this evil process.  I have heard that other countries, such as China and Russia, are upgrading their forces to protect themselves from expected United States aggression.  Much of the world thinks America is planning to rule over the whole earth using the same excuse as did the ancient Roman Empire (PAX ROMANA or Roman Peace).

2643758,5,B000HWXOT0,"As with any made documentary, it generally portrays a point of view, and comes up with thin slices that support that. This documentary does does present a point of view : of how the Iraq war is being turned in to mind boggling profits for mighty corporations who are sleeping in bed with republicans. And it presents a lot of facts to support that. Testimony of how Halliburton was running empty trucks, endangering the lives of its employees (who are not entirely blameless) to bill the US government (you and me). Of how Halliburton would blow up a brand new 100K truck with a flat just so that they could buy a new one.

  There are lots of things happening in Iraq that are illegal. But what shocked me most is the use of private contractors for Military Intelligence gathering. So you are putting a person (Contractor whose primary motive is profit) in charge of a job that affects the lives of American Soldiers, you are essentially endangering American lives. And the blame lays squarely on the Repbulican Leadership and their friends in Halliburton, KBR, CACI etc.

  I hope, now that both the House and Senate is controlled by Democrats, that an investigation is launched, and the crooks running these companies are brought to book, prosecuted, sent to jail and the companies are forced to shut down.

2643759,5,B000HWXOT0,"First off, this isn't a film that denigrates our armed forces.  Nor does it get into a discussion as to whether our invasion of Iraq was justified.  The point is very simple, the war in Iraq has been outsourced in the most callous and greedy fashion imaginable; generating billions of dollars in revenue for a number of corporate contractors; while putting American civilians and soldiers at risk.

Many documentaries tend to pile on, making point after point until the viewer wants to cry out ""enough already, I'm convinced!!!"" (for example ""The Corporation"", which would have been a much better film had it been 20 minutes shorter).  But Iraq for Sale presents its witnesses and facts with such clarity that you can't help but want more.

Active duty and retired soldiers (from all levels of the chain of command), civilian contract employees and surviving family members provide the most compelling voices for the filmmakers; along with the usual think tank representatives and business execs.  And then there are the statistics.  Sure, you can bend numbers to make your point, but some numbers are more compelling than others.  Consider for example the fact that in the last four years, the price of Halliburton's stock has quadrupled.  Could the billions of dollars in Iraq-related contracts have anything to do with that?

What so many people seem to forget is the fact that the corporate/government cooperation model does not always balance well.  What's good for government is not always conducive to profit generation.  And on the other hand, what might be good, solid management and cost control for a corporation could have disastrous ramifications for government.  Take for example a field cafeteria for troops in Iraq.  Good business suggests that it's more economical to serve meals at set times.  But that creates a situation where soldiers are waiting in long lines at regular intervals in the day.  How long do you think it takes for an insurgent with a mortar to figure out when is the best time to attack a base like that?

But if only it were that simple!  Factor in the $45 cans of Coke, the $99 bags of laundry, the lives put at risk by sending trucks on dangerous routes with minimal security and you have the makings of a true scandal.  And did I mention the bacteria-infested water provided to our troops by Halliburton?  Is it right to risk lives to cut costs?

Watch it, buy it and loan it out to your friends!  This is a scandal that has not been discussed nearly enough.  ""Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers"" may be one of the most important films of the decade.",1170892800,,2590,4.796839729119639

2643761,4,B000HWXOT0,"I watched this movie to pursue a line of personal 'interest' on the depth of corruption and hypocrisy of Governments, having spent many years investigating similar topics on many governments around the globe - not just the US.

This video was pretty slick and well presented, and was slightly different to the 'Loose Change' and 'Terrorstorm' style of presentation of these conspiracy-revealing DVD offerings. In fact it offered a closer, more personal view of the victims (and their families) of the big Mega-Corps like Halliburton and Kellogg, Brown and Root, speaking to many of the civilians who were caught up in the carnage of Iraq working on the big, juicy contracts of these mega-Corps, and investigating the horror they went through.

Whilst I'm pretty sure I wouldn't sign a contract to go to war-torn Iraq and not expect to find death, destruction and carnage all around me, it's pretty impressive to see just how both innocent civilians and the government alike are lied to in order to do two things - i) get the job done, and ii) earn a stack of greenbacks in the process for the big boys.

The depth of corruption and 'couldn't care less' attitude of the faceless office execs who draw human lives into the risky theater of war, offering them lies about their safety, never ceases to amaze me. The whole blurring of the line between civilians and the military in these combat-hot regions was pretty eye-opening I must admit, but most astonishing is the fact that EVERY American taxpayer is also being heavily ripped-off by the invisible CEOs who deny all accountability or even knowledge of what is going on. It actually makes me wonder just why it is allowed to carry on unabated, until I remember that people with this level of absolute power are corrupted absolutely... The age-old adage wins out again.

Still, I must admit that by the end of the DVD, I had a slightly different, more informed view of what is going on between the big Corps and the US government. The extra footage of various (Democratic...obviously) congressmen trying to expose the greed of these corporations to the American public - and being defeated every time by a Republican majority, makes an absolute mockery of the whole American system of freedom, justice and honesty. If I lived in America, I'd surely want to know just how my dollars were being swindled by the big boys with the big connections, but to be honest I think the rabbit hole runs so deep that most people just turn that other cheek as long as they have their dinner on the table and gas for their car. And that's sad.

The DVD was very enlightening in a 'new' way, and once more hammers a nail into the coffin that bears the reviled name of ""Bush's America"" upon it around the rest of the world. I only offered it 4 stars however, as I felt that there was certainly a some room for more detailed evidence, supporting facts and related stories. There was considerable time spent on emotional depth to each story, and although loss of life is undoubtably not a trivial matter, I feel that the message of the producers would have been stronger and clearer by offering more evidence and variation - of which I know there exists a veritable mountain.

Watch this if you want to see that extra objective and yet emotional dimension, and hear the facts and evidence straight from the horse's mouth...and then make your own decision.

This DVD will leave you feeling lied to. If it doesn't, then you must be driving today to your plush office at Halliburton, KBR, any of the other mega Corps covered in this great offering - or maybe Washington DC...",1169769600,,3603,4.7004754358161644

A short summary of the movie could be put like this, ""Companies are making a profit, the government is wasteful, the employees are good ol Joe Average, the politicians and company management are sinister.""

I've been here for three years, as military and civilian  and I'm amazed at the LOW number of civilian casualities.

2643774,4,B000HWXOT0,"Every time I hear someone tell me it is un-American to question the motivations behind and the execution of a war, it really upsets me. In reality, it is the ability to speak up and raise objections that defines us as Americans. But who is it that is really undermining the troops? Is it those who have failed to adequately plan for, equip, and staff the war effort, and have put the lives of U.S. troops in the hands of corporations? Or is it those who seek to challenge these failed policies? I would hope most would choose the former as the greatest threat to both the safety of troops and the eventual outcome of the war.

This film underscores this debate in the context of what is evidenced as real, genuine war profiteering. The war profits are reprehensible enough, often overcharging the U.S. taxpayer and under-training their men on the front lines. But I believe the filmmakers, at their core, have attempted to place blame on the U.S. government for creating this situation in the first place. Certainly private contractors have played a part in military operations for a long time now, but not to the extent to which they play a role in this war. Everything from providing water, food service, laundry service, transportation, and even interrogations are put in the hands of private contractors. And, as the film points out time and time again, these corporations have no real allegiance to the U.S. military, nor are they governed by the same codes of military conduct or the Geneva Convention. You can imagine the serious problems that can arise when private contractors, essentially mercenaries with no oversight or accountability for their actions, are fighting side by side with U.S. troops making 25% of the salary of the contractors.

Overall, Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers is an eye-opening and infuriating look at a situation most Americans know about already, but to which they have essentially turned a blind eye. This film simply and unequivocally illustrates exactly how great a stake corporations have in the Iraq war, which leads me to my one criticism of the film. Among the many great issues raised, I don't believe the following conclusion is ever addressed. That conclusion is this: We can assume that the #1 goal of any soldier in a war is to bring about an end to that war. The #1 goal of any corporation is to make a profit. Therefore, it is in the interest of military contractors to sustain the war as long as they are making a profit. Therein lies the most elemental conflict with the war profiteers. We put a company in roles vital to the success of the war, yet a successful conclusion to the war would likely end most or all military contracts the company would be awarded. To whom do these contractors pledge allegiance? Do they act in the best interests of the U.S. war effort, and thus risk losing these lucrative contracts in the peaceful future? Or do they act in the best interests of their company's bottom line and flirt with treason in the process.

Now tell me who is really ""undermining the troops.""",1162771200,,3055,4.727954971857411

2643778,5,B000HWXOT0,"In 1968 there were only 63 lobbyists in Washington. Today, there are more than 34,000 and lobbyists now outnumber our elected representatives and their staffs by a 2-to-1 margin.

According to the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, from 1998 through 2004, lobbyists spent nearly $12 billion to not only influence legislation, but in many cases to write the language of the laws and regulations.

Individual firms, corporations and national organizations spent a record $2.14 billion on lobbying members of Congress and 220 other federal agencies in 2004, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. That's nearly $6 million a day spent to influence our leaders. We really do have the best government money can buy.

The facts above are critical to what has and continues to happen in Iraq.  Major corporations like Halliburton have such an enormous influence in Washington that decisions are made not to benefit the people or OUR TROOPS but the corporations themselves.  Corporations exist for one reason: to make a profit.  They are not human although they legally exist as ""entities"".  They have no feelings, no sense of reason or morality.  They exist only to grow larger and more powerful - at any cost.  This excellent documentary shows the living proof of that sentiment.  Every taxpayer in this country needs to see this film and needs to know how his/her money is being spent and at what cost.  We are paying the highest cost - the cost of human life.  The only way to end these horrid practices is through responsible legislation.  I urge anyone reading this to review the voting records of all candidates up for election and vote for those who have voted FOR ending the pilfering of these companies.  Right now there is simply no oversight.  Private contractors in Iraq are literally above the law.  When Paul Bremer left Iraq he set up a series of rules and laws for the virgin interim Iraqi governing body.  One of those laws gave legal IMMUNITY to all private companies doing business in Iraq.  In other words, if you steal, torture or even kill, the worst that will happen to you is that you'll be sent back to the U.S.  A week later you can head right back to Iraq simply working for a different company.  This is sick and needs to end.  Please see this film and tell everyone you know to do the same.",1160611200,,2311,4.7853535353535355
2643779,3,B000HWXOT0,"I just reviewed this DVD on my blog, Robert's Virtual Soapbox. Here is the review, copied and pasted (and slightly edited) from my blog:

Last night I saw Robert Greenwald's latest documentary, Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers, at a community showing of the DVD.

Iraq for Sale is worth watching, but the documentary gave me two strong messages, one intended and the other, I am fairly certain, quite unintended.

The first message is what I already knew: that the Vietraq War always was about war profiteering, especially the war profiteering of Dick Cheney's Halliburton.

The second message I also already knew, but not to the degree that Iraq for Sale makes painfully clear, and that message is that Americans, even those on the left, are starkly Americentric.

Iraq for Sale, by not offering an opposing viewpoints on the matter, supports the myth that American contractors flooded into post-""shock and awe"" Iraq out of noble intentions, such as to help the Iraqi people (especially through reconstruction), to spread ""freedom"" and ""democracy,"" and to (somehow) strengthen the United States.

These noble American contractors surely weren't attracted to Iraq out of greed! That they could make several times the amount of money that they could make for the same work in the United States surely was not their primary motive for going to Iraq!

So in Iraq for Sale we listen to interviewee after interviewee -- including survivors of American contractors killed in Iraq and American contractors who were injured in Iraq and/or who witnessed the deaths and/or injuries of other American contractors in Iraq -- talk about the noble intentions of the contractors.

The fact is that the majority of the American contractors who flooded into Iraq were/are just as greedy as are the executives at Halliburton and the other war-profiteering subsidiaries of BushCheneyCorp. All of them, from the CEO of Halliburton to the individual American contractor, wanted a piece of the Iraqi pie. None of them seems to have or to have had a problem personally profiting from the Iraqi people's grave misfortune.

That's called greed. And there is nothing noble about it.

What would Jesus do? War profiteer? That one is war profiteering him- or herself, under the auspices of a war-profiteering corporation, as a contractor -- is that supposed to free the individual from any personal guilt? Is it the case that the corporation is guilty but that those individuals who work for the corporation -- who make the corporation's very existence possible -- are innocent? Is it the case that the Empire in the Star Wars movies is evil, but that the stormtroopers and others who do the Empire's work are innocent because, hey, they have families to feed? (Well, OK, the stormtroopers are clones and they don't have families, but you get the point.)

At least those American contractors interviewed in Iraq for Sale who state that they went to Iraq so that they could have more money for their families are more honest about their motivation than those who talk about helping to rebuild Iraq, help the United States, blah blah blah. But helping your own family at the expense of the Iraqi people -- isn't that a bit hollow? Do you really want to send your kids to college on blood money, on money that a war-profiteering corporation stole from the American people via the bogus Vietraq War? Are you really OK with the fact that Iraqis had to suffer and die so that you could send your offspring to college?

And why is it that Americans don't call evil things evil until and unless they are touched by those evil things themselves?

For instance, would Lila Lipscomb, the mother of the young American soldier who was killed in Iraq who is depicted in the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, be against the Vietraq War had her son returned safely home? Or would she still be the pro-military mom that she depicts herself to be in Fahrenheit 9/11 before her son is killed? Is the Vietraq War wrong only because her son died in it?

The American contractors and the survivors of American contractors in Iraq for Sale: Would they be bashing the war-profiteering corporations had they or their loved ones just gotten their money without incident? Are the war-profiteering corporations evil only because the corporations screwed them over?

Iraq for Sale doesn't touch on these profound moral issues, and throughout Iraq for Sale are boo-hoo-hoo stories of the bad things that happened to American contractors, most of whom were/are just greedy opportunists, while the plight of the Iraqi people comes into the picture only when Abu Ghraib prison is discussed, and Abu Ghraib prison is discussed only within the context of war profiteering, such as the war profiteering by the corporation that provided torturers and the corporation that provided ""translators"" who weren't given so much as a simple test of their language and translation skills before they were given jobs in Iraq.

Iraq for Sale makes it clear that the primary purpose of the Vietraq War was to make it possible for the subsidiaries of BushCheneyCorp to steal billions of the American taxpayers' dollars through fraud, corruption and waste in Iraq via the bogus war that the Bush regime delivered to them. They couldn't just storm the U.S. treasury and steal billions of American taxpayers' dollars outright, so they decided to do their stealing via the Vietraq War.

Iraq for Sale is worth watching because every American needs to realize this fact.

But I find the myth of American innocence that pervades Iraq for Sale to be unsettling -- and, ultimately, dangerous, because until Americans wake up from their delusions of moral superiority and complete and total innocence, they imperil themselves.

In Iraq for Sale American interviewees express their belief that the Vietraq War really was for the benefit of Iraqis and they express their shock -- shock! -- that the war-profiteering corporations in Iraq actually care more about their profits than they care about the safety and the lives of the American contractors who make their obscene profits possible. News flash: Corporations care more about money than they care about people! Who knew?

Do the American interviewees in Iraq for Sale really believe the bullcrap that comes out of their mouths, such as that the American contractors went to Iraq primarily for noble, selfless reasons? Or is it the case that it is necessary for them to believe that they and/or their loved ones who are/were contractors in Iraq aren't/weren't greedy, selfish and soulless, just like those of BushCheneyCorp, and that they think that if they repeat what they want to believe just enough, it will make it true?

So watch Iraq for Sale. You need to know what the Vietraq War is really all about.

But as you watch Iraq for Sale, note how pathetically Americentric it is, and ask yourself what the average Iraqi citizen would think about the United States and Americans if he or she watched an American documentary about the hardships of those poor, poor American contractors and their survivors when thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed and maimed in the American war profiteering in Iraq and when it will take years and years for Iraq to return to anything like normalcy.

2643780,5,B000HWXOT0,"No doubt this will automatically be labeled as ""liberal propaganda"" by some but the issues tackled in this film should be of concern to everyone, Republican or Democrat.

I must admit that I didn't know much about contracting before this film came along, though I had heard bits and pieces before in the news about Dick Cheney's shady Halliburton dealings. ""Iraq For Sale: The War Profiteers"" truly opened my eyes to the horrendous waste and fraud that is going on in Iraq and the risks that contractors and our troops have been exposed to by companies who were found in some cases to value money more than human life. People might possess the misconception that this film takes a stance against the war and against private contracting in general, but that is absolutely not the case; rather it takes a stand against war PROFITEERING and tells the stories of those who have been personally affected by it. The interviews with family members whose loved ones died needlessly are truly heartbreaking, as is the moving testimony of a former Halliburton employee, Ben Carter, who discovered the company was providing contaminated water to soldiers.

I recommend that everyone show the film to friends, family and co-workers since Brave New Films counts on people and not theaters to distribute their movies. A definite must-see.",1159833600,,1324,4.986425339366516
2643781,5,B000HWXOT0,"I don't have much to add beyond Cvairag's excellent review; but people looking for this sort of analysis will also want to purchase the DVD of Eugene Jarecki's documentary ""Why We Fight.""

We may not have the resources to print a million copies of these DVDs, but the Iraq for Sale website does offer a discount on bulk orders, and civic organizations like ""Code Pink"" offer the DVD at a discount as well.

Lastly, I'm not so sure that the American voters actually endorsed this regime and its policies of corporate fundamentalism and state terror.  Authors like Greg Palast have revealed all sorts of voting chicanery, and I just viewed an excellent DVD on the issue called ""American Blackout,"" which features Palast and Cynthia McKinney (who has been predictably smeared by the elite establishment).

""For the friends of the free market operating in Iraq, it doesn't matter who gets killed or why; every day is payday, and if from time to time events take a turn for the worse - another twenty or thirty Arabs annihilated in a mosque, a BBC cameraman lost on the road to the airport -back home in America with the flags and the executive-compensation packages, the stock prices for our reliably patriotic corporations rise with the smoke from the car bombs exploding in Ramadi and Fallujah: Lockheed Martin up from $52 to $75 between July 2003 and July 2006; over the span of the same three years, Boeing up from $33 to $77; ExxonMobil up from $36 to $65; Chevron up from $36 to $66; Halliburton up from $22 to $74; Flour up from $34 to $87.""  -Lewis Lapham, from his editorial in the September, 2006 issue of Harper's magazine.

Lapham's critique also provides the answer as to why we're in Iraq - some people are making a lot of money off of it, and they want to ""stay the course.""",1159660800,,1785,4.632911392405063
2643782,5,B000HWXOT0,"Greenwald and team's new documentary takes the public inquiry into the real causes for policy decisions made in Washington over the past eight years . . . well, maybe a lot longer to a new level.  The film attempts to detail explicitly the activities of the four biggest war profiteers: Haliburton, Kellogg Brown & Root, CACI, and Blackwater, and examine the results of the privatization of war.  The film and the twenty minute section on the DVD which records the failed attempts made in Congress by Senators Dorgen, Leahy and other Democrats to regain the type of Congressional oversight that the putative representatives of the American people had back in the late 1940's/early 1950's under the Truman Commission.

The implications of the ramifications of this unbridled corruption are perhaps even more terrifying than the tragic testimonies which are recorded to justify the exposition and argument made in the film.
The film does the great service of detailing for a mass audience, with more essential specifics than presented in this medium before, the depth of the control these war profiteers exert over our elected representatives and the danger they have brought to our front door, all in the blind pursuit of more almighty dollars than anyone could ever possibly spend.  Even combat veteren General Smedley Butler, who was the first, I believe to coin the phrase ""WAR IS A RACKET"", could not have imagined the surreal proportions to which war profiteering has been taken in Iraq, all at the expense of the American tax-payer and a bunch of innocent people now dead.

Greenwald, in my opinion, has always been a rather conservative film-maker with an ability to get to the root of the big problems, but frankly, not a whole lot of dramatic flair (ala Micheal Moore, Erroll Morris, or the makers of ""Hidden Wars of Desert Storm""). Determined to reach to the hearts in the Heartland, he seems absolutely adverse to showing any sort of partisanship at all, almost too responsibly objective, a style which, to my eye, somewhat enervates the presentation.  But perhaps, there is more wisdom to his approach than I would care to admit. For instance, in 'Outfoxed', while doing a pretty good job of exposing the hypocrasy, dishonesty, deceptiveness, and bullying techniques of that now venerable vehicle of fascist propoganda, he does not beat the drum for the fact that Murdock is a dangerous foreign national, with extreme right wing verging on monarchist, oligarchic, political leanings operating in the US.  Greenwald, does, however, in a sort of understated way, point to the incredible danger to our Democracy presented by Fox News Network, America's favorite babysitter (believe me, more of Reagan's Robots are coming of than the Gipper ever would have dared to dream for - all nursed on Hannatty's and O'Reilly's Goebbelesque rantings. ""Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Prices"" was a much happier affair as an investigative documentary - really hard hitting in its best moments - and his best effort dramatically.  Again, Greenwald and his crew, through a sort of explanatory expose, make us aware of the root of a REALLY BIG PROBLEM.

These films make you aware and they make you mad. 'Iraq for Sale' shares with them - the same, slow paced - non dramatic - deliberate - consciously non-partisan style. And you will get angry - furious. But, will it get the American voting public to finally do something about the problem come November?

True to the filmaker's form, ""Iraq for Sale"" does not spend a second on  the speculation that the Iraq venture was consciously planned years in advance to profit those who are discussed in the film.  It does spend almost the entire duration detailing how those profits were eventually made and continue to be made, the type of suffering so far engendered, and why no oversight has been established to stop the bleeding.

Farenheit 9/11 was released in the Summer before the 2004 elections.  Although it was by far the most viewed film world-wide that season, the majority of Americans did not see it!  A shocking truth.  And this one, folks - for better or worse - will not jerk you out of your seat as that monumental effort did for many. Rather, like Inconvenient Truth - it's more of an explanatory type of document - and to wit - much of it is basically already known by many, though perhaps not in such specific detail - however, it's a real service to have it all in one place - to show to as many folks as possible before the November elections.  One wishes, we could print millions of dvds and dump them in places like Pennsylvania, Virgina, the deep South, Texas, Oklahoma, the Sun Belt, before they all go out and do it again!  But, at least, if you care, buy a copy, and show it to some people before election day (or on it - outside the polling booth!)

Unquestionably, ""Iraq For Sale"" is team Greenwald's most important venture to date dealing with the ROOT (no pun intended) of THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, and should be seen by every American, especially those who actually believe they're doing their patriotic duty by voting Republican -because they've bought the argument that by supporting certain American business interests, America is going to stay strong, and that somehow by not supporting them, America's military is going to be weakened. The film succeeds is revealing this deceit for what it is, perhaps the most destructive lie ever bought by the majority of American voters.",1159401600,,5445,4.886117136659436

8141578,5,B000HWXOT0,"This is a controversial view into the IRAQ WAR.

IRAQ for SALE: The War Profiteers is a 2006 documentary film made by Robert Greenwald. Produced while the Iraq War was in full swing, the film deals with the alleged war profiteering and negligence of private contractors and consultants who went to Iraq as part of the US war effort.

Specifically, the film claims four major contractors - Blackwater, K.B.R.-Halliburton, CACI and Titan - were over-billing the U.S. government and doing substandard work while endangering the lives of American soldiers, Iraqi civilians, and their own employees. These corporations were tasked with virtually everything except the actual killing,including food, laundry, housing, security, intelligence gathering and interrogation.

I really enjoyed the film from a both a patriotic and political standpoint. Check it out...it's worth 90 minutes.",1449100800,,878,5.586466165413534
8141579,5,B000HWXOT0,"Unfortunately I watched this movie only now (the movie's release date was in 2006), and I am shocked beyond belief. The fact that some politicians in our great country and some people in the Department of Defense supported this kind of war profiteering is shocking beyond belief.

Though I always opposed the Iraq War on the basis that the US does not engage in a preemptive war, obviously the truth is worse than I thought. Watching this movie it appears that America only engaged in that war so certain companies could make a (financial) killing while people (Americans and Iraqis) got killed.

At least to me it looks suspicious when CEO's of private security companies make 50 million dollars on operations which in the past had been handled by the military.

The movie shows a story of systematic abuse of people (some American employees of private security firms, who got sent in war zones, for which they weren't prepared, as well as Iraqis), tax payers' moneys, and the American spirit.

This movie should be a must-watch for every American citizen over the age of 18.
