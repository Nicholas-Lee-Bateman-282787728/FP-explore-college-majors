7946566,3,B00005NBA1,"How do I say this delicately? Simply put, there isn't a way. The movie is bad. BEYOND BAD. Probably one of the worst kung fu movies by way of plot that I've ever seen and that's saying a lot considering, most kung fu movies have paper thin storylines.

Cliff Lok, a likeable actor portrays a Kung Fu man who can adapt to various style by way of watching his opponent's moves. He calls himself Genius because of his ability to learn styles so quickly. He is followed about by his idiot sidekick and together they devise a plan to open a second school in their small town. Genius is soon challenged by the students of the Spiritual Kung Fu school, and quickly defeats them all. The students scamper, all but one who begs his Kung Fu master to go after the master of the Genius school. The Master advises that they are all brothers and to leave it alone. The student disobeys, and manipulates the school's top student (played by Hsiao Hou) to go after Genius.

The Spiritual school's two top students go to Genius school and threatens to smash it up. They are stopped by Genius, who challenges them to a fight. The other student, who has already been beaten by Genius is certain his friend, who has mastered the monkey style will defeat Genius. The student, played by Hsiao Hou is expert. But Genius quickly learns his style and defeats the student.

The defeated students are teased by Genius' sidekick. So one of them goes back, and beats the sidekick that night, rendering him mentally handicapped - he acts and moves like a robot after being kicked in the scrotum. Genius finds out and goes after the students. The first student, the one versed in Monkey Style has chained the sidekick by the neck, and uses him to amuse crowds. Genius frees the sidekick and demands to know who did this to him. The student confesses that his friend is responsible and that he is at a local brothel. Genius goes to the brothel, in the process they cause some destruction at the scene which angers the brothel owner. They get into a fight and the brothel owner's son is badly injured. He decrees that everyone at both schools, the Spiritual School and Genius school must be killed to avenge his son.

Genius follows the student out, beats him and forces him to apologise for what he has done. THe student apologises but lies on his friend who uses the Monkey Style, challenging Genius to another fight. They fight with weapons this time, Genius with a stick, and the brilliant student with a hoop. The student is defeated again.

Fast forward to the plot to kill everyone at both school, and the rest of the plot unfolds, and there is death. At the spiritual school the master uses the Duck style, which was pretty cool.

The plot is bad. I saw the English dubbed version of this and it was unimaginably horrible. The Kung Fu was OK. Just OK. Nothing spectacular or noteworthy. Hsiao Ho was in the movie and was the only reason I watched it, but he only had 4 or 5 lines. Seemed like his only purpose was to give the actor Cliff Lok an excuse to use the Monkey Style, and of course, Hsiao Hou was #1 in the style, after Mad Monkey Kung Fu - I don't think anyone has done it as well since. He even does the Drunken Monkey style. So it seemed ridiculous to me that Genius was able to beat this character. Hsiao Hou, for as short as his ten minutes in the movie was, the other Kung Fu stars were clearly outclassed. Which is probably the reason why he is on the DVD cover when he had such a small part.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the duck style. Seriously, what can a duck do? And how does a Kung Fu master emulate a duck to defeat his opponents? Silliness. I gave it 3 stars for the Duck Style and Hsiao Ho. Otherwise, it's garbage.",1300752000,,3730,4.389290882778582
7946567,4,B00005NBA1,"KUNG FU GENIUS (1979) is an excellent vehicle for unsung kung fu star Cliff Lok (OL' DIRTY KUNG FU) who plays a self-proclaimed kung fu ""genius,"" notable for his unique ability to easily pick up varied kung fu styles. Even while in the midst of fighting he watches his opponents' moves and then uses them himself to defeat the opponent. In the film's opening scene, Cliff quickly peruses a stack of training manuals and performs Eagle, Butterfly, Monkey, Rat, Mantis and Rabbit styles.
Aided by his ""idiot"" sidekick (Cheng Kang Yeh), Cliff starts his own ""Genius"" school and immediately becomes a rival of the local ""Spiritual"" school run by Chan Lung. He is challenged by the top students there, including monkey expert and iron hoop fighter Hsiao Hou, and outfights them all. However, one of the fights takes place at the local brothel, and both schools run afoul of the brothel owner, Lee Hai Sheng (aka Lee Hoi San), who calls in his brother, a lethal fan fighter played by Wilson Tong, the film's director. Several more major brawls occur before Cliff takes on both Lee Hai Sheng and Wilson Tong in the spectacular 11-minute finale.
The film's simple but effective plot serves as a vehicle for at least six major fight scenes and functions as a showcase for the talents of four major kung fu performers (Lok, Lee, Tong, Hou), and several fine supporting players, including the always dependable Chan Lung and Cheng Kang Yeh. It's all very well-photographed and staged and is consistently entertaining from start to finish of its 84-minute running time.
The DVD edition from Eastern Heroes/Xenon offers a high-quality letter-boxed transfer made from a fine-looking, if slightly worn print. It's easily one of the best-looking kung fu DVDs available from this particular company and one which belongs in any kung fu fan's collection.",1041292800,4,1836,4.964285714285714
7946568,4,B00005NBA1,"Not bad at all. No wire-fu (I like wire-fu) but the intensity and complexity of the fight scenes kept my attention and the plot had a few interesting twists and so was not as predictable as some. The styles were an invulnerable 'spiritual' style and lots of animal styles. The weapons were knives, staff, hoop(!) and fans.
The reason I did not give it more stars (I would give it 3.5 stars if it was possible) was because once in a while the choreography allowed us to see that it was, indeed, choreography and the *attrocious* sound quality. The video quality, well, like many others of this genre, it was taken from an old reel of film - but it did not distract me from the movie itself, except during the very 1st and very last frames.",1018656000,,738,4.394160583941606
