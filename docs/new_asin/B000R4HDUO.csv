2858372,3,B000R4HDUO,"""Cowboy"" Bill Watts legendary wrestling territory is back on DVD with another collaboration of old school footage & matches from the Mid-South wrestling promotion.  This DVD is set up just like Volume 1 in that it's not a historical look of the promotion or anything of that nature, just archival footage featuring wrestlers & other famous wrestling personalities in their early days before their ""more recognizable"" runs in the NWA/WCW/WWF.  Various names return for this volume of the Mid-South series (Dick Murdock, Jim Ross, Ernie Ladd, ect.) along with some new names & faces (Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Barbarian, Midnight Express, Jim Cornette, Dick Slater, Iceman Parsons, Sir Oliver Humperdink, former Four Horsemen valet Dark Journey, The Fantastics, cult favorite Lord Humongous, Shawn Michaels, ect.).  There are segments & promos in this set as well like Ted Dibiase talking about an incident that happened with Duggan & why he no-showed his helmet match with ""Dr. Death"" before a bloody & beaten Jim Duggan gives a promo explaining that he was ambushed in the parking lot by Ted Dibiase & his henchmen, video montages of Buzz Sawyer & Jim Duggan, and Andre The Giant being interviewed by Vince McMahon himself.

Now there are some faults in this set just like the last there was in the last one as well with false & misleading advertising.  One the back cover, they advertise a blinding of JYD by the Midnight Express...all that happened was that JYD had some power thrown in his face during a match that he recovered from quickly, it's not the INFAMOUS angle where Junkyard Dog was blinded for weeks (by the Freebirds).  The biggest one they did was advertise Ric Flair getting a ""brutal beating"" by The Freebirds and even on the chapters menu, it said ""Freebirds vs. Flair"" when in reality, this was Mid-South's footage of the famous WCCW (World Class) cage match between Ric Flair & Kerry Von Erich where Michael Hayes was the special referee & Terry Gordy slammed the door in Kerry's face.

Various Matches Include:
NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ted Dibiase (the actual match that happened after Dick Murdock attacked & bloodied Dibiase on Volume 1)
Ted Dibiase & King Kong Bundy vs. ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Magnum T.A.
Jim Duggan vs. One Man Gang
Junkyard Dog vs. King Kong Bundy
""Mad Dog"" Buzz Sawyer vs. Nick Patrick (who would go on to be a well known WCW/WWE referee)
Butch Reed vs. Jim Niedhart
Junkyard Dog, mexican legend Mil Mascaras, Andre The Giant vs. Tully Blanchard, Killer Khan, Gino Hernandez
Jim Duggan vs. Nikolai Volkoff

I enjoyed Volume 1 more than Volume 2 but the result is still the same as I said before, this is a good DVD for old school professional wrestling (not ""sports entertainment"") fans & being a old school wrestling fan, I recommend.",1201046400,12,2788,4.854736842105263
2858373,5,B000R4HDUO,"I'll be honest from the start & let you know that I never saw Mid-South Wrestling growing up and the only exposure I had of them was ""The Missing Matches"" VHS series that came out close to 20 years ago that had footage of both Mid-South & Memphis Wrestling.  But I'll tell you that this was good look at wrestlers (and Jim Ross himself) in their early days before the went to the big time stages of ""sports entertainment"" in the NWA/WCW & WWF.  And this is footage that your getting direct & don't have to wait for WWE to put out on their various DVD sets because they don't own it.

The DVD itself is nothing but archival footage from the territory.  It's not a historical look of the promotion or anything of that nature & the matches are not even in chronological order.  None of the matches or footage goes longer than around the 10 min. mark.  Most things here are actual complete matches but there are around 2-3 cases where the footage is just a segment that happened such as Flair's only appearence where he's suppost to face Ted Dibiase but a short fight breaks out between him & Dick Murdock so Flair doesn't end up wrestling afterall.  Besides these things, you get Hall Of Famers (Andre, Junkyard Dog, Bob Orton Jr., Paul Orndorff, Dusty Rhodes, Wild Samoans, Tony Atlas, Nikolai Volkoff, Jim Ross, Ernie Ladd) & other popular wrestlers of the past & present (Butch Reed, Jim Niedhart, King Kong Bundy, Kamala, Jim Duggan, Magnum T.A., Rick Steiner, Rick Rude, ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams, One Man Gang, Tully Blanchard).

Various Matches Include:
Nikolai Volkoff vs. Terry Taylor
King Kong Bundy vs. Junkyard Dog
Ted Dibiase vs. Paul Orndorff
Butch Reed vs. Rick Rood (""Ravishing"" Rick Rude)
Junkyard Dog vs. One Man Gang
Tully Blanchard vs. Paul Orndorff
Butch Reed & Jim Niedhart vs. Dusty Rhodes & Jim Duggan
""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Rob Ricksteiner (Rick Steiner) vs. Jim Duggan & Butch Reed
Dusty Rhodes, Junkyard Dog, Andre The Giant vs. Ernie Ladd & Wild Samoans

In the end, this is a good DVD for old school professional wrestling (not ""sports entertainment"") fans & being a old school wrestling fan, I highly recommend.",1196208000,7,2145,4.6684350132626
2858374,3,B000R4HDUO,"Mid-South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians is ideal for the wrestling fan that is quickly tiring of the ""sports-entertainment"" palette served up by the WWE/TNA's of today's wrestling world. Featuring over twenty matches with clear quality, this piece of wrestling nostalgia would normally be worthy of five stars. However, the first segment on the DVD automatically lowers the rating by committing the equivalent of wrestling sacrilege:

Ric Flair (or ""Rick"" Flair according to the graphics department) vs. Ted DiBiase is an absolute bloody classic that culminates with a great angle involving a violently jealous Dick Murdoch. Unfortunately, the match is not included on this DVD. Rather, we are treated to the angle preceeding the match where DiBiase is busted open by Murdoch while a supercilious Flair looks on before eventually walking out of the ring altogether. And that, as they say, is that.
 Forget about a bloodied DiBiase doing a Spirit of '76 impression by returning to the ring with a stained bandage wrapped around his head. Forget about Bill Watts warning the viewers of the impending graphic melee (and taking a few potshots at boxing in the process). Forget about a newly face-turned DiBiase taking Flair to his limit in one of the most emotional, exciting, blood-soaked battles ever witnessed.  Nope, it's not here.

The Flair/DiBiase match is easily one of the best to ever emerge out of Watt's Mid-South area, so unless the match is being saved for future releases (which is really a crummy practice), the fans are being robbed of witnessing this wrestling marvel. And despite his caricature dominating a good portion of the DVD cover art, this is all the Ric Flair you're going to get in this collection.

The rest of the DVD, however, is a smorgusboard of the major players involved in Mid-South Wrestling. From a young baby-faced ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams,a heel ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan, a skinny and uncharasmatic (Ravishing) Rick Rude, and a svelte Jim (Good Ol' JR) Ross, this collection allows us to see the genesis of many stars that would eventually go on to populate the bigger federations of the 80's and early 90's.

Mid-South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians acts as a window to the past vis-a-vis wrestling territories and how certain wrestlers were marketed. For instance, the WWE would have us to believe that Hulk Hogan was the first man to slam Andre the Giant at Wrestlemania III. However, a segment on this DVD shows the ""Ugandan Giant"" Kamala effortlessly slamming Andre with a fully-executed bodyslam (as opposed to Hogan's more famous half slam).

With over 2.5 hours of old-school wrestling goodness, Mid-South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians is available at a great price and worthy of inclusion in any wrestling collection. This DVD may, in fact, be one of last remaining independent territorial releases before the Mid South tape library is purchased by McMahon & company (which is inevitable at this point).  It's a shame that as good as this DVD is, it could have been made so much better by the inclusion of one certain match.",1188604800,12,3115,5.046692607003891

8198836,4,B000R4HDUO,"Ive been buying some wrestling dvds that are not WWE or TNA, and I admit this set along with part 2 are some of my best purchases. After my last review of part 2, I wrote i'm surprised WWE has not bought these videos. A question appeared on a wrestling website asking why Vinnie Mac has not purchased this company a few days after writing it. Maybe I inspired the guy to write it but anywhoo, the widow of the owner of the company does not want to sell the tapes. She rather make money for herself, good for her. This is anther great set of matches, although the JYD-Bundy match is almost the same as it is on the second dvd. I hope they release more of these dvds in the future because they are well worth the money.",1209168000,2,717,4.128571428571429
8198837,5,B000R4HDUO,"I miss the days of WWF Superstars where stars would take on talent enchancement (jobbers). Sure it was not five star classics but still fun to watch. This set reminds me of a epsiode of Superstars. Many WWF stars of that era are on this set. The picture is crystal clear and fully loaded. The matches aren't very long but still have good action. I wish they added more of Lord Humongous (Sid) because he had a cool look. Excellent dvd and well worth the price if your fan of old school wrestling. Im surprised Vince McMahon didn't sue the company for this footage.

A small gripe is when wrestling, the fighters seem to wear the same color trunks. It can be confusing when watching.",1208563200,3,682,4.456
