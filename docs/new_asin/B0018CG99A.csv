There are a wide variety of properties, small ones and large ones, large lots or track homes. There is an idea for every kind of home. You must buy all 3 DVD's to view all the amazing transformations!",1357603200,,378,4.8307692307692305
8269412,5,B0018CG99A,"I not only have all three of his videos, but also have had Paul do landscape architecture for me at my house.  He does a really nice job, has lots of great ideas (just watch a video or two...and take some notes) but is also willing to listen and work with you.  Plus he isn't a flake, dang I hate that about some contractors!!  He works hard and has a good eye for color, theme and textures....you will not be disappointed.  If you don't know exactly what you want or how to do it, then get either this video or one of his other ones- they will give you alot of good ideas and directions to explore.",1328400000,,599,4.094017094017094
8269413,5,B0018CG99A,"I am fortunate to own the author's now out-of-print book.  His video CD's offer an excellent resource necessary to anyone, expert or novice, who is interested in block/stone type hardscaping.  His blend of soft and hardscapes gives the user an endless source of ideas. The author, Paul Nordmark, calls himself, on his business card, a ""Structure Artist"".  After viewing his videos, I believe most people will call his title an understatement.  He truly is blessed with a talent that comes through in vivid colors and structures.

Through his video you are moved by his faith, patriotism, and knowledge of landscaping to beautify America...one garden at a time.
