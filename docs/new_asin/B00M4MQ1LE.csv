8670300,5,B00M4MQ1LE,Absolutely terrific film (if you can get past the Skinimax feel of it all). I thought the actor playing Evan was exceptional and should consider more acting work. I actually think I saw him make an appearance in Magic Mike XXL. If anyone has hard copies please let me know I would love to purchase them.,1490832000,,303,4.428571428571429
8670301,1,B00M4MQ1LE,"Its basically someones film school project that somehow got released. I can handle the bad acting, the bad editing, the bad camera work. At least they are making an effort to be creative even if they have no clue what they are doing. Its the bad writing and bad directing that makes it next to impossible to watch. If you are related to any of these people then you should probably see it in the same way you should probably read your 4th graders essay about Thomas Jefferson and not care about how trite and cliched and badly written it is. But if you want to actually watch a movie and be entertained, stay far away... Its not worth it... Not even out of morbid curiosity...",1449187200,,676,4.373015873015873
