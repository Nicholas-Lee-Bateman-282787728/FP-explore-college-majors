2398827,5,B000AYQNXE,"This 3 DVD disc set is really worth the money, in my opinion.  Each disc has ""never before seen footage.""  And I felt that each disc was really ""jammed"" full of scenes to watch, I never felt slighted or anything.  They were all really cute and funny!  Good buy!  Good and cute for kids as well!",1146960000,9,294,4.178571428571429
2398828,5,B000AYQNXE,This DVD set is for anyone who Loves Animals and is a fan of Matt Gallant who is a Great host for the show. Matt Gallant is one of the reasons the show has been so popular with his introductions to the Funniest animals videos. These DVDs are some of the Best from the show and a good for family. Matt Gallant gives the introductions to each animals video DVD.,1131753600,9,359,4.142857142857143

8081080,2,B000AYQNXE,"For example, if you like to fall onto a couch and see your cat go flying into the air, or spin your dog on a rope from a tree, because it doesn't know it should let go, or you like to send your dog on a sled into a wall.  They also have one where people tied a ball in front of a dog's head and watched him run trying to get it.  But the best is the poor little (apparently) blind dog that circles the kitchen island, and bumps into it.  This is supposed to be funny because there's a little bird following the dog.
  Other than the teasing clips, there are a lot of what you'd get in the zoo.  Animals turning over to get sun, etc..  And there are what look like vacation videos of monkeys bicycycling, a bird roller skating, twice.  If you're tired, don't plan on these waking you up.
  But they do have some with tv. announcers that were caught off guard by their prey.  The narrator doesn't tell us it's Steve Irwin, but just after Steve tells us the snake on him won't bite, it bites him in the neck.  And Steve still finishes his sentence.  I'm keeping disc 2 just for that.  I'm a fan, that is.
  I also bought ""America's Funniest Home Videos"", and so far, their animal clips are funnier.  I'd seen parts of ""The Planet's Funniest Animals"" show before and expected more.  If this is the funniest of the funniest, I'll be skipping volume 2.  This was $5.",1386979200,4,1360,4.181467181467181
8081081,5,B000AYQNXE,"If you love funny animals, this DVD set is for you! It's the planet's funniest animals, what more do I need to say?",1365897600,,115,4.043478260869565
8081082,4,B000AYQNXE,My  grandson seemed to like it; so I assume it was a good choice.  It was one of hie Christmas requests.,1356307200,,104,3.9047619047619047
8081083,1,B000AYQNXE,I thought this was part of the AFV collection. It was not. The man doing the voice over is as lame as the clips. Do not buy.,1306195200,,124,3.6296296296296298
8081084,1,B000AYQNXE,"Sad, lame, slow, disappointing. I went to sleep, and I'm a AFV fan! But this seems to be a collection of so-so stuff, only good for a chuckle now and then. Nothing like the TV show. Wish I hadn't bought it.",1204070400,3,206,4.048780487804878
8081085,5,B000AYQNXE,"Very good DVDs. The only thing missing is the host. We only hear the voice over, and I enjoyed him from the show on TV. Very funny clips of animals doing strange or funny things. The whole family loves them!",1152489600,5,207,4.2
8081086,5,B000AYQNXE,We bought this for an elderly relative who cannot hear.  It has become a great bonding experience with how funny this DVD is.  She doesn't even need to hear to enjoy it.  It has some of the funniest clips that I have ever seen (and I watch Animal Planet Funniest Animals a lot!!),1151452800,11,279,4.226415094339623
