8005985,5,B00013D4UY,I had this video for my daughter (who is now 10) when she was a toddler.  Now I am due with my second child and this is one of the first things I looked for.  So charming.,1282089600,2,171,3.5945945945945947
8005986,5,B00013D4UY,This is such a lovely children's DVD.  I love it as much as my granddaughters.  The characters are charming non violent toys who live together and share adventures.  How I wish it were still available.  I have given several away as gifts but now I am unable to find it anywhere.  If you come across one be sure to pick it up.,1207440000,3,325,4.17741935483871
8005987,5,B00013D4UY,"This DVD is among my all time favorites for young children.  Charmingly narrated, each of the six short stories details some adventure of the loveable stuffed toys in a children's playroom.  Whether hosting a celebration for a stuffed dog who has never had a birthday party, enjoying a sports challenge to win homemade trophies, or sailing down the river in homemade boats, the stuffed toys are filled with personality, caring, and humor.  One of my favorite parts?  There is absolutely nothing scary in any of these stories.  Another plus:  You can choose to play one of the ten-minute stories at a time, a set of three for a half-hour show, or all six.  I have given this DVD, and others in the series, as gifts numerous times, and they have always been a hit.  A definite five-star, in my book!",1154822400,,797,4.642857142857143
