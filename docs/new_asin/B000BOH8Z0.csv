2432691,5,B000BOH8Z0,"The Time Tunnel ranks with Star Trek as one of the brilliant sci-fi masterpieces of the '60s. Sure, it was an adventure series, designed to capture the interest of all audiences. But it has received an undue amount of substandard criticism over the years. Many popular reviews completely fail to appreciate the philosophical concepts behind many of the episodes and focus instead on the scenery or backdrops. In general, I feel the scripts actually improved as the series progressed because the technicians, given their restraints, were learning how to manipulate the Tunnel controls. My favorite episodes remain 'Chase Through Time' and 'The Death Merchant', both of which present thoughtful and challenging scripts.",1132963200,23,717,5.410714285714286
2432692,5,B000BOH8Z0,"James Darren was the star of this Irwin Allen Classic.  I used to call it the clip show. Allen would take footage from old films to match them up with the episode written.  This saved production costs when he had a lot of movies to choose from. There are quite a few good guest stars from 60's Tv that have already been mentioned here...

I also liked Lee Meriweather (Catwoman in Batman) as one of the stars in the Time Tunnel control room. Although her figure was well hidden by a white lab coat!",1132963200,12,498,4.276595744680851
2432693,5,B000BOH8Z0,This was my favorite show next to Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea as a kid so I'm very excited to see it being released on DVD at long last. Shame it only lasted the 1 season though.,1132358400,9,182,3.6923076923076925
2432694,5,B000BOH8Z0,"Well well well.....after waiting for this series to come out on betamax ......then vhs .......and now FINALLY on Dvd I cant tell you how excited I am! I grew up with this series in the south east of the U.K and it was screened every sunday at lunch time.....Im sure you can only begin to imagine the arguments as to what time the rest of the family were going to eat sunday lunch as I was the only one who seemed obssesed with what would happen ""next week on the time tunnel!"" In my opinion Erwin Allen made a cheap t.v series(old hollywood film sets)but coupled with the viewers imagination and a 'will they, won't they, get out of trouble?' story line it proved magnetic and in a nut shell pure and exciting fun. I really hope that who ever decides on the final content of the ""extras"" disc has done some homework and not robbed us of a few interviews - the cast are with us and it would be a great shame not to see their views on the series after this long and well overdue wait...

2432695,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I hated the Time Tunnel, although I never missed the show. I was always frustrated by the fact that Tony and Doug, our time traveling heroes always landed in some precarious spot, like the deck of Titanic or the Little Big Horn battlefield. The pair never just landed on the street in Bakersfield in 1953, no. They were always in the middle of stuff and never had a clue as to how to stay out of a jam. Still the program, set in the far future of the 1970's, was entertaining and sometimes touching. My favorite episode was set in Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. There Tony encounters not only his own father, but himself as a freckled kid played by a boy named Sheldon that I knew at Bancroft Jr. High School in Los Angeles at the time. So get the Time Tunnel and be prepared to be frustrated!",1131580800,5,794,4.3
2432696,5,B000BOH8Z0,"When it came to television Sci-Fi where the viewer had to use just a little a bit of imagination, no one did it better than Irwin Allen.  (Rod Serling was in a class all by himself).  I'm glad to see the included bonus extras.  This series boasted a handsome roster of soon to be mainstream and veteran character actors ever to grace the small screen.

I fail to see why all the criticism regarding this TV show.  Because it is just that: a Fictional TV SHOW!  Like I said; you have to have a bit of imagination to enjoy any SciFi show from the past.

Thank you Fox Home Entertainment! (Thank goodness this series IS NOT being released by Universal Home Video.)

Update! NOT SO FAST!

Fox, you really let me down.  I am extremely dissapointed that the DVD's are doublesided, non-picture discs.  This is a MAJOR gripe with me and many others.  On the second episode, I'm seeing pixalation and freeze up.  Are you guys in league with Universal or what?  Take a hint from Paramount and Image Entertainment.  They know how to package a DVD season set (aside from the T.A.G.S. #4 laugh track QA/QC debacle).  Your formatting this set in this manner just plain blows!

One more thought.  After watching the pilot episode, ""Rendezvous With Yesterday"" the true fantasy is trusting a U.S. senator with a highly classified secret.  Now that's real science fiction! :-)",1131321600,14,1358,4.630252100840337
2432697,5,B000BOH8Z0,"This is truly one of Irwin Allen's best sci-fi series. This show had a great spectacular and memorable opening sequence of dazzling color and lights of two men tumbling back and forward in time and space. The Time Tunnel complex was fantastic to see on your living room screen for that time perior of 1966-67. The quality of the episodes were very inmaginative and filled with excitement aimed at grabbing the attention at the time of another hit show of the same year, Batman, both of these shows where shown on ABC-TV. If these episodes are remastered from

the original 35mm prints, then this will look great on the new  plasma tv's.........I really hope that they are released with the original opening tag of...........""The Time Tunnel in color"" which preceeded each opening episode, although short lived as a series, The Time Tunnel was really a very cool show...........if this one sells and I'm sure that it will.......this can only lead to the release on dvd of another great IA series ""Voyage to the bottom of the sea""...........wow!!!!.........please bring them on with lots of extras while most of the cast are still here, we fans have been waiting too long!!!!!!!!!!

2432699,5,B000BOH8Z0,"THE TIME TUNNEL (ABC 1966-67) is certainly one of the late Irwin Allen's better SF tv series produced in the 1960s and this long anticipated two volume DVD collection promises to be something truly outstanding for the show's devout fan following.

It has been promised (by informed insiders) that the source elements utilized for these disc pressings will be taken from the original 35mm print masters newly restored and digitally remastered in high definition with each episode presented in its entirety along with the original cliffhanger endings complete and intact.  Probably in anticipation of ultimately issuing this valuable tv property (once again) in HD somewhere later down the line.

The volume one 4-disc box set (due out on January 24th, 2006) will consist of the first 15 episodes presented in their original ABC Television Network primetime broadcast order along with the 55 minute production pilot of ""Rendezvous with Yesterday"" (09/09/1966).

Many of the show's best efforts can be found here including ""Rendezvous with Yesterday"" (in two versions), ""One Way to the Moon"" (16/09/1966), ""End of the World"" (23/09/1966), ""The Day the Sky Fell In"" (30/09/1966), ""The Last Patrol"" (07/10/1966), ""Revenge of the Gods"" (21/10/1966) and ""Massacre"" (28/10/1966).

THE TIME TUNNEL is one SF tv series that certainly got off to a very strong start indeed!

The series' single season is marked by the early tv appearances of such distinguished performers as Carroll O'Connor, Ellen Burstyn, Tom Skerritt, Susan Hampshire, Jim Davis, Susan Flannery and even Robert Duvall many of whom would shortly achieve greater celebrity becoming Hollywood legends in the ensuing years to follow.

The list of actors and actresses who made guest appearances on the show reads like a virtual Who's Who of Hollywood including such notables as Michael Rennie, Gary Merrill, Warren Stevens, James T. Callahan, Paul Fix, Gregory Morton, Paul Carr, James Westerfield, Linden Chiles, Michael Pate, Torin Thatcher, Vic Lundin, John Doucette, Dee Hartford, Joseph Ruskin, Abraham Sofaer, Nehemiah Persoff, Michael Ansara, Kevin Hagen, Michael Pate, Joe Maross, Christopher Dark, Lawrence Montaigne, Marcel Hillaire, Oscar Beregi, Theodore Marcuse, David Opatoshu, R.G. Armstrong, Scott Marlowe, Rhodes Reason, John Lupton, Malachi Throne, Lyle Bettger, Michael St. Clair, John Wengraf, Donald Harron, John Crawford, Mako, Phillip Ahn, Jan Merlin, Frederick Beir, Byron Foulger, Ross Elliott, Edwardo Cianelli, Richard Jaeckel, John Hoyt, Myrna Fahey, Arnold Moss, Anthony Caruso, Rudolpho Hoyos, Peter Brocco, Robert Walker, Jr., Victor Jory, Regis Toomey, Lew Gallo, Vitina Marcus, Arthur Batanides, Paul Mantee, Christopher Gary, Vincent Beck, Mabel Albertson and John Saxon.

The first fifteen episodes contained in the volume one 4-disc box set will be comprised of the following 15 segments:

01) ""Rendezvous with Yesterday"" (09/09/1966)

02) ""One Way to Moon"" (16/09/1966)

03) ""End of the World"" (23/09/1966)

04) ""The Day the Sky Fell In"" (30/09/1966)

05) ""The Last Patrol"" (07/10/1966)

06) ""The Crack of Doom"" (14/10/1966)

07) ""Revenge of the Gods"" (10/21/1966)

08) ""Massacre"" (28/10/1966)

09) ""Devil's Island"" (11/11/1966)

10) ""Reign of Terror"" (18/11/1966)

11) ""Secret Weapon"" (25/11/1966)

12) ""The Death Trap"" (02/12/1966)

13) ""The Alamo"" (09/12/1966)

14) ""Night of the Long Knives"" (16/12/1966)

15) ""Invasion"" (30/12/1966)

All to be presented in spectacular colour taken from pristine, vault stored 35mm negatives for optimum visual and audio quality insuring maximum entertainment value.

This should prove to be one of the major DVD releases of 2006!  Coming out in January it's certainly a marvellous way to begin the New Year for serious collectors of classic tv series from the Golden Age when television and imagination were not strangers to each other.

This classic of Science Fiction, written and produced in the mid 1960s still has relevance today, the science and the fiction both hold up well with a campy adventure through time. The top secret project built in the desert, only a few years on from the Manhattan Project and current with the construction of the underground SAC, NORAD and government bunkers during the cold war was and still is plausible. The Time Tunnel itself is similar in concept to the linear accelerators which were then being built. The other underlying theme, the idea that ""Yes we can build it"" but then ""what happens when the darned thing malfunctions?"" is quite clear as the tunnel crew deals with one major malfunction after another and several near total disasters.

Abbott (""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"") ""THE TIME TUNNEL"" showed that true and pure Jules Verne imagination,that Irwin Allen had depended on,while producing all his 1960s sci-fi shows,with ""LAND OF THE GIANTS"" arriving on the airwaves in Fall 1968.  in Volume One of a two part DVD collection (the other,released in 2007) the first several episodes of ""THE TIME TUNNEL"" begins with ""Rendevous With Yesterday"",along with the unaired TV pilot version of the series,which tracks the reluctant Time Travelers,after ""Dr Tony Newman"" (James Darren) hurls himself into the massive Tunnel,as a sacrifice to prove that the machine works,when a skeptical US Senator (Gary Merrill) threatens to shut down the project by cutting-off the funding-so as Dr Newman materializes on the deck of the doomed Oceanliner,""The Titanic"",the people at The Time Tunnel monitor his experience,when ""Dr Douglas Phillips"" (Robert Colbert)
volunteers to hurl himself into The Tunnel,to rescue his ambitious colleague,right before The Titanic strikes an Ice Berg-and compounding their problems,is when the people they're trying to warn,brands them as kooks,for all the good it does any of them! liked by many,and frowned by a few,""THE TIME TUNNEL"" was still a great TV series,as well as original,,despite Irwin Allen's cost covering use of re-using many of his props and sets,while at Twentieth Century Fox,this series showed one of the most awesome sets ever made for a Primetime show,despite it's one season run,the first 15 episodes of this show,are worth watching!  look for Carroll O'Connor (""ALL IN THE FAMILY"") in a duo role,in ""The Last Battle"" segment,and the remarkable ""One Way To The Moon"" episode,that shows stock footage from 1954's ""DESTINATION:MOON""-but the best episode of the series,was ""The Day The Sky Fell Down"",as the Time Travelers materialize in Pearl Harbor,a day before the Japanese attack,while Tony Newman gets to encounter himself as a little boy! this ABC series was among the finest of it's type,during it's 1966-67 run,and i seriously recommend this DVD to viewers,who really like this kind of well made TV shows,with a superior production value-but i also caution buyers to be very careful of these Multi-Disc DVDs,because they're vulnerable to scratches,video distortions,and skips! it is seriously hoped,that Fox Home Entertainment will re-release this,and the remaining Irwin Allen shows on BluRay discs,with a more better quality-and great special features,like the previous ""LOST IN SPACE"" BluRay Set previously released!",1455235200,,3509,5.553271028037384

2432765,4,B000BOH8Z0,"By the time Irwin Allen's ""The Time Tunnel"" premiered on ABC TV on September 9, 1966, the versatile producer/director/screenwriter had already released two hugely successful television programs. His first, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" itself based on Allen's 1961 film, ran for four seasons, from 1964 - '68, and can almost be viewed as ""Star Trek"" underwater (actually, since ""Voyage"" preceded ""Trek"" by two years, it would be more accurate to say that ""Star Trek"" was ""Voyage..."" in outer space!); it remains a favorite of this viewer even today, 50 years later. Irwin's second TV success, of course, was ""Lost in Space,"" which lasted three seasons, from 1965 - '68, and, for some reason that continues to elude me, was an enormous fan favorite. Personally, I've always found the show to be inane, embarrassing, and borderline unwatchable...only partially because I cannot stand Jonathan Harris' Dr. Smith character. Hoping for yet another megahit, Irwin constructed his biggest set yet for ""The Time Tunnel"" and assembled a grade-A cast and crew. ""Time Tunnel,"" sadly, was not a success for Allen, lasting only a single season. I absolutely adored this program when I was a kid, but had not seen it in almost 50 years...until several months back, that is. Now, thanks to the DVD sets available from 20th Century Fox, all 30 episodes of this fondly remembered program (fondly remembered by aging baby boomers, anyway) can easily be seen again, in stunning-looking restorations and with a remarkable roster of ""extras.""

In the program's spectacular first episode, the viewer is given a tour, along with a U.S. senator (Gary Merrill; the first in a long string of impressive guest stars to come), of Project Tic-Toc, a vast complex beneath the Arizona desert. When the senator informs the project's senior members that government funds may soon be cut off, headstrong scientist Dr. Tony Newman (James Darren) enters the titular time travel device and is thrust into the past, with no means of return. He fetches up in the year 1912, aboard an ocean liner called...the Titanic! Meanwhile, fellow Tic-Toc scientist Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert) enters the Tunnel to try to rescue his associate, also landing on the doomed ship. And thus, the basic pattern for the series is set. Every week, our boys appear in some equally dangerous historical location, while back in the ""present,"" a trio of Tic-Toc workers--project leader General Heywood Kirk (the great character actor Whit Bissell) and scientists Raymond Swain (John Zaremba) and Ann MacGregor (cult actress Lee Merriwether)--watches them via the Time Tunnel apparatus and attempts to render long-distance (both spatial and temporal) assistance. Over the course of the 30 episodes, our boys kerplop down in such diverse scenarios as World War 2, the War of 1812, on an island right near the erupting Krakatoa, at Custer's ""last stand,"" in the midst of the Trojan War, at the Alamo, in King Arthur's realm and on Devil's Island. They help prevent an assassination attempt on Abraham Lincoln, fight Barbary pirates, go up against Cortez, battle the Mongol hordes, and join up with Robin Hood! Later episodes become even MORE sci-fi oriented, with no fewer than four outings dealing with various invaders from outer space (one during the Battle of Khartoum!). It's all highly improbable, terrifically entertaining stuff, with our two brave (and remarkably fit) scientists continually pinballed around both time and space....

Despite the inherent silliness of some of these story lines, several factors combine to put the weekly conceits across. First and foremost is the inherent likability of the show's two handsome leads, Darren (already a hugely popular actor and recording artist prior to ""Time Tunnel"") and Colbert. Then there are the special FX, which are uniformly fine; the Time Tunnel set itself is most impressive, while the FX in that opening episode are often eye-poppingly spectacular...especially for '60s TV. And then there is that aforementioned impressive roster of guest stars, including Michael Rennie (the captain of the Titanic), Warren Stevens, Carroll O'Connor, Nehemiah Persoff, Michael Ansara, John Hoyt, Eduardo Ciannelli, Victor Jory, Robert Duvall, John Saxon, and a seemingly endless parade of what I like to call ""Star Trek"" alumni. As the series progresses, viewers will likely begin to wonder about three pressing questions: Why do our boys constantly seem to land in the middle of dangerous/violent historical situations; why can't they ever touch down in some peaceful little town in 1950s Ohio or something? (Because there'd be nothing interesting or dramatic to fill 50 minutes up with, I suppose.) Why do all the people they encounter, no matter in what country or era, be they Trojans, Hebrews, Mongols or French Revolutionaries, speak perfect English? (Even ""Star Trek"" tried to explain its similar conundrum with a ""universal translator."") And finally, why is it that no matter what period garb Tony and Doug happen to be wearing, before they get whisked back into the (truly psychedelic) time vortex, Tony's trademark green turtleneck sweater appears on him, and ditto for Doug's tweedy jacket? (I have not a clue about this one.) Those viewers who manage to overlook such imponderables may find themselves in for some truly engaging television here.

From the vantage point of five decades of hindsight, it is also a mystery just why ""The Time Tunnel"" only lasted a single season. In all likelihood, the stiff competition on the other channels--""The Wild Wild West,"" ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" and ""Hogan's Heroes""--had a lot to do with it. Allen, of course, would go on to even greater success in his next TV series, ""Land of the Giants"" (which ran two seasons, from 1968 - '70), and especially cinematically, with his blockbusters ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972) and ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974). Though it might be deemed one of his less successful ventures, ""The Time Tunnel"" yet remains ripe for discovery and reevaluation today. Further good news regarding these DVD packages is the truly generous raft of extras to be found in them; around four hours' worth, including the unaired pilot, home movies, camera tests, concept art, storyboards, merchandise, still galleries, and modern-day interviews with Darren and Colbert (both hunky dudes, still), Merriwether and Bissell, PLUS the 2002 unaired TV pilot for a ""Time Tunnel"" remake, AND the 90-minute ""Time Travelers"" TV movie. Just try to find the, uh, time to watch all this stuff! Truly, a package of wonders! My only real complaint, after having reacquainted myself after all these years with this fantastic series, is this: I now find that I have a ""man crush"" on James Darren and Robert Colbert!",1442448000,,6759,5.176416819012797

2432779,3,B000BOH8Z0,"I was mesmerized by this show when I was an eight year old in 1966 and it ignited a love of history for me.. I bought it for nostalgic reasons. But the acting and scripts are pretty corny and some of the history is inaccurate as well. The show had a great concept and great potential and much could have been done with it but Irwin Allen and crew had an odd creative sense - very pedestrian and sometimes the story lines are almost ridiculous. On the plus side, for 1966 the special effects are pretty good, especially when our heroes are drifting from one historical moment in time to another and the Time Tunnel Control room was pretty well done as too. The realism is fleshed out by the numerous out-takes from movies that were spliced in to set the historical stage beyond the scenes filmed on the studio back lot. But in 1966 - 67 as I child, this show gave me my first introduction to such historical events as the Alamo, the siege of Troy, Halley's Comet, Rudyard Kipling in Afghanistan, the Battle of New Orleans, etc, etc and for that, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for it, no matter how corny and sloppily done most of the show appears to my

I had hoped shows like ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea""' ""Lost in Space"" and ""Land of the Giants"" had some better writing and less ""Irwin Allen"" effects.

It's a well-done blending of 1960's plots about time travelers lost in space, stumbling into one history-changing event after another from the Alamo to the fall of Troy.  It's fun to pick out the stock footage sources as you watch, from The 300 Spartans to The Buccaneer to A Night to Remember.  The stories themselves are good, the often long-gone guest star appearances are welcome, including Michael Rennie as captain of the Titanic and future TV star Carroll O'Connor playing both a British general at the Battle of New Orleans as well as his 20th Century English descendant who joins the doomed advance against General Andrew Jackson.  Probably Allen's most ambitious low-budget dodge of tapping stock footage to beef up a story.",1386028800,3,835,5.028985507246377

I remember the first episode like it was yesterday.  Greg and Tony get sent back in time to April 14th, 1912 aboard the Titanic.  I won't reveal anymore.  VCR/DVRs did not exist in 1966.  If you missed an episode you were SOL.  I have enjoyed two episodes that I did not see back then.  I was relieved to learn this morning that the Time Tunnel saved our earth from Halley's comet that almost destroyed us in 1910!  This is real stuff folks.

Sure the effects are a bit cheesy at times, but they do a good job with what they had to work with back then.  It is great to see this show in color.

Buy it now.  It will bend your mind!",1371168000,3,896,4.133720930232558
2432846,5,B000BOH8Z0,"For many, the name Irwin Allen conjures up the all-star, special effects-laden disaster epics of the 1970's. Before securing his reputation as ""The Master of Disaster"", Allen was the driving creative force behind four exceptional science-fiction TV shows: VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA (1964-'68), LOST IN SPACE (1965-'68), THE TIME TUNNEL (1966-'67), and LAND OF THE GIANTS (1968-'70). While diverse in subject matter, all shared the ingredients of imaginative adventure, top-notch production values, endearing characters, and exciting action.

Allen's third series, THE TIME TUNNEL, follows two scientists (James Darren, Robert Colbert) who are lost in the mazes of time after a test of a secret government project called ""The Time Tunnel"" goes awry. Each attempt to return our heroes plunges them into another era, past and future.

It was a great premise, as viewers were treated to various historical events on a weekly basis. The episodes also devised some clever twists in the way the two time travellers interacted with history and affected its playing out as recorded. Although it lasted only one season, THE TIME TUNNEL was truly unique and highly influential to television sci-fi. Due to the nature of its premise, the show hasn't dated, and can still be enjoyed by modern audiences, whether young or old.

The entire series is available on two DVD volumes, and all the episodes deliver excellent quality in picture and sound. In addition, we get an extended version of the pilot, behind the scenes home movies, camera tests, stills galleries, TV promos and radio spots, and interviews with cast members.

This was one of my favorite shows as a little kid, and was instrumental in piquing my interest in history. Watching it now, some 46 years later, I still love it. Great, classic TV shows like THE TIME TUNNEL truly are... timeless.

Will I guess most people don't like TV shows about general historical events like the sinking of the Titanic ship. I would of liked it if there were many more episodes of these two men traveling through time. It kind of reminds me of another TV show started in 1982 called Voyagers with Meeno Peluce and Jon Erik-Hexum. That series unfortunately only yielded twenty episodes and there was a sinking of the Titanic which they tried to save. My thoughts are this. Why are some of the very best TV shows have such short runs. I can only hope that better TV shows will be made today and will last three or more years.,1315958400,,683,4.3023255813953485

It is late, the control room is dark.  You initiate the start-up sequence and set the power level low so that you won't travel too far in time.  Someone's coming.  The tunnel's diminishing ovals beckon.  You jaunt up the tunnel's walkway.

You feel a tingling sensation; sparks and a blue mist surround you.  You are being irradiated by peculiar rays which will create a time tag in your body; this will allow the time tunnel to lock on you later.

It begins.  Like an astronaut in free fall in outer space, you are falling through time.  Strange, but beautiful amorphous patches of colored light stream by you.  Suddenly you tumble onto a hard surface; you are no longer falling.

You are on the deck of an ocean liner.  You learn from a woman in a deck chair, that the ship is bound for New York.  You might as well relax, enjoy yourself; a tour of historical New York City should be interesting.  Besides, it will probably take some time before they can figure out how to return you safely ...

Based on a scientific project nicknamed ""Tic-Toc"" time travelers Darrin and Colbert, enter the ""Time Tunnel"" and get catapulted to different eras when important events such as the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, The Titanic, The Spanish Conquista of Mexico, etc. take place.
The travelers are lost in time as their co-workers back in their Arizona headquarters are trying to retrieve them back.

2432880,4,B000BOH8Z0,"The Time Tunnel which originally ran during the TV show season of 1966/67,was unfortunately just a one season wonder. However it is a series which still managed to captured the fancy of many a viewer back then and it still holds quite an appeal today.
The show involves the adventures of Project Tic-Toc run by General Kirk(Whit Bissell).Two scientists Tony Newman(James Darren) and Doug Phillips(Robert Colbert) are the time travellers who from week to week are injected by the tunnel from one random time period to another. Many of the story lines were quite interesting while others could be run of the mill,but the speical effects for that time are still pretty good and still hold up. Irwin Allen,the producer,also made liberal use of the 20th Century sound archives for background music and effects and the video archives for filler scenes.
Volume one has some fine eps in it and the acting,whether by the stars themselves or the supporting casts, are all top notch and believable. This four disc two-sided set,like Vol. 2,is NOT remastered. However the master tapes used are of such high quality that I can see why they didn't got through the process. I didn't see any objectionable thing in this set worthy of repeating here,and that's saying something.
The extra features involve some interesting Irwin Allen home movies,a photo gallery,a visual effects camera test and a rare unaired version of the extended version of the pilot ep.
This entire season has been split into two different sets which I take umbrage to. I notice all of Irwin Allens shows on DVD are very expensive also and I think it is really ""taking"" the public,when they could have easily put this season into just one set. Also the DVDs are all two sided which are SO prone to scratching. They produce cheap but ask PLENTY!
In conclusion this wonderful show from the 1966/67 TV season has arrived on DVD and it looks great. The shows are generally quite interesting and the possiblities for it were endless,it is just a shame it didn't continue beyond one season. Do be warned of the two sided discs and the careful handling they require. However it's a show the ENTIRE FAMILY can watch and considering the surprising historical accuracy with which each show was handled,it is not a stretch to call it educational for the younger set.

(Interesting side note--the night before the first episode aired on September 9, 1966, another science-fiction show debuted on NBC--Star Trek.)  The show itself was pretty corny, and full of inconsistencies--Doug and Tony had no qualms about changing history with their actions in the past, which would have screwed up everything for the future.  The pilot episode sports an electric-bulb chandelier aboard the Titanic in 1912!  (In a later episode, the geniuses who run the incredibly trouble-prone Tunnel send an MP with a submachine gun back to ancient Troy!)

I feel that I have truly seen these episodes for the first time!! Why did I buy it? There was an evening devoted to Irvin Allen on the BBC here in the UK. It featured most of his series, together with a documentary about his life and work. This included the first episode of The Time Tunnel - the one set on the Titanic. Basically, I wanted to know what happened next - now I do. I can't recommend this set highly enough. Fantastic in every sense, including the restoration. The stories are great too and, if I remember correctly, the first episode was the most expensive hour of TV produced to that date - and it shows! The effects are great, and there wasn't even a computer around to generate an image at the time. Where The Time Tunnel went, Quantum Leap would follow two decades later, and others would be similarly inspired. If you recall the series, get reacquainted; if you just want to watch some really well done fantasy TV, then buy it!",1204156800,,1081,4.278048780487805

There is so much visual potential in this series, and such a wealth of stunning images that Fox could have selected from.

2432888,5,B000BOH8Z0,"I won't repeat the list of episodes that other reviewers were so kind to spend the time putting in and keep my comments to the content. In general, I LOVED it. The series played in my sleepy town when I was in Grade school (some years after it was initially produced), and I remember seeing it with my family, glued to the TV on that weekly night. So I was pleased to see that it  was out on DVD and even more pleased when the music, the graphics, and the show was just as I remembered it, and even better--in that at this point in my life, I was able to understand more of the dialogue and actually more of the historical events, which weren't 'just' about a show for me anymore. Naturally, knowing the history of the show and how it utilized films to offset costs, might be a minus to some, but I personally found the often quite NOT seamless transitions amusing and charming. No one pretended that everything was shot anew, and as that, it was not only good economy, but from an enviromental point of view, created less polution... (i.e. no need to film from scratch... ;-)). I loved Doug and Tony, the sometimes overly simple dialogue, the clean themes (i.e. not much violence, no sex to speak of--which althoug is a nice enough thing, doesn't have to be in EVERY media interaction regardless of topic, as it tends to be in shows nowadays) that allow me to let my nieces and nephews watch it, and the general untimeliness of the show. It could VERY WELL stand today, as the younger generation's enthusiastic response showed.
I highly recommend it to any parent, nostalgic viewer, and educators (yes, history teachers--how about some video in the classroom before a new topic taught, or as a summary afterward?). Makes a great gift, too.

I found it quite entertaining still.  And it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful Lee Meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.

2432897,5,B000BOH8Z0,"If I could give this show 4.5 stars, that might be closer to how I feel about it, but 5 stars will do.

Like some of the other reviewers, I grew up on this show (I believe I was nine or ten when it aired); naturally, my memories of it are not close to what it actually was.  Seeing it as an adult, I can see its flaws--the cheesy time tunnel, the use of stock footage from (I assume) films to pad out scenes, the very static situation in the control room, which is pretty much the only place the non-time travellers are EVER seen (must have been hard to stay fresh as an actor if you were on that end of things).  The show also indulges in certain stereotypes--the noble English versus a myriad of savages, for example; also the menacing Asian stereotypes are prevalent. The show's concepts of aliens is pretty silly--why are they all silvery, looking like they're wrapped in foil?

Still, each week is a history lesson, and despite the show's occasionally awkward cultural assumptions, it does also come up with challenging ways to consider certain historical moments--Custer's Last Stand, which represents Custer as ambitious and blind; Mako, in the WWII episode in Volume 2, makes up for the horrid stereotypes in Volume 1's Pearl Harbor episode.  I think the key to the show's ""success"" is the main duo, James Darren and Robert Colbert, who work so well together, and who seem so sincere and committed in every scene.  Sometimes you would hope they'd introduce a little humor into their adventures, but that never happens.  The Time Tunnel never gives you much of a window into the lives of the characters, which can be frustrating. But Darren and Colbert give us everything they've got every week, as do Whit Bissel, Lee Meriwether, and John Zaremba back in the control room.  Had the show come back for a second season (producer Irwin Allen ended the show when ABC requested a 1/3 budget cut for a second season--ABC was #3 out of 3 in those days, and was notoriously cheap), I'm sure the focus on showing the viewers the tunnel would have been reduced, and more interesting scenarios developed.  In any case, this show is done very sincerely and with pretty good attention to physical and historical detail, even when budget constraints are evident.

Finally, the extras (Allen's home movies, sans audio; interviews with four of the five principals) show a little extra care in the overall package and give a window into what TV was like then and how it's changed.

Definitely a cut above even then, and truly better than most current programs.  Generally well-written, finding some human crisis in each historical moment, well-acted, and always interesting.  Highly recommended.",1180656000,4,2686,4.775377969762419

That is what the Time Tunnel was.  I remember watching it as a kid, and loving it.  The effects, the time travel, it was superb.  And then it was never, ever replayed on New Zealand TV.  So I bought this DVD of the first series.  It's still quite enjoyable, but not as much as when I was 10!  The acting is terrible (and that is being kind).

This is among my all time favorite series, and the release of it on DVD makes me realize what a shame it was that there isn't more of it.  OK, I didn't care for the alien episodes, and the One Way to the Moon isn't among my favorites either but 26 out of 30 episodes that I like (more or less) isn't bad.  I clearly remember looking in the encyclopedia to find out more about the Titanic after the first epise, and I looked up Devil's Island too.  Originally, the Titanic episode was my favorite but now it's the Pearl Harbor episode.

I gave this a 4 star rating simply because some of the episodes in season one were not to my fancy, even when I was a boy; but the acting quality and special effects are choice in all episodes.

Even the silent home movies Irwin Allen had made on the day in and day out activities going on with the sets and filming were enlightening to watch.  What ashame he did not shoot in sound.  It would have made them even more interesting to view. I wanted season one simply to have the opening episode which was a classic starring Michael Rennie and the sinking of the Titanic.  Don't know if I would buy season two.

2432909,5,B000BOH8Z0,"I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic and it remains one of my favorite TV shows ever. Because they dared to enter the Time Tunnel before it was properly tested; scientists Tony and Doug float helplessly in time, while waiting for their colleagues to retrieve them. The major concern for the two of them is not to do anything in the past that would alter the course of history. Will Tony and Doug ever get back to the present or will they wander the time continuum for ever?

Either the original prints of this show were in amazing condition to begin with or the studio spared no expense to remaster them for this release. The video transfer is absolutely stunning and the audio is crisp and clean albeit in mono. It's too bad given the technology available today; the studio couldn't remaster the sound in 5.1 Dolby Digital, maybe they thought it didn't need it. In my opinion the picture is really amazing and I don't ever remember seeing this show look so good.

I give volume one of the ""Time Tunnel"" five stars for pure television enjoyment and wish the show could have ran longer. Volume ones 4 double sided disc set contains the first 15 episodes of this classic show, the unaired extended version of the pilot episode, Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects, camera test, still galleries and promotional TV and radio spots.

Once again this set is lacking in cast interviews. Many of the actors from this show are still alive, so why didn't the studio interview them for the DVD release? It would be a welcomed addition to any DVD release to see the actors today and get their thoughts on the show. My major gripe is that this show only ran for one season, so why split it into two volumes? Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one complete boxed set at a reasonable price for fans.

The first episode was probably the best because you get to see the long spiral of the tunnel from the side (I don't think that was ever shown again) making it look like a huge expense for a set at its time.  If you can overlook obvious flaws such as:

  - why no matter what clothes they were wearing or how disheveled they were, Tony still ended up with the same green turtleneck sweater and Doug his perfectly pressed business suit.

  - No matter what time period or country they went to, everyone spoke modern English.

  - They usually ended up at key historical moments (this made you see how they would try to change history (unlike Star Trek) such as preventing the Titanic from being sunk or Lincoln from being shot.

  - The consoles that they looked at (squiggly lines) with huge tape drives along the sides of the complex.

Fancier gimmicks or effects are not needed since there is plenty of room for the essence of imagination: if I were there too...

  Actors of great skill as well as then newcomers cram the films full with quality reenactments. The only weaknesses in the series are in 2 areas: 1]not enough variety in music scores, typical in most 60's shows, so unless you love the suspense melodies as I do you'd get quite bored.  2] minimal inconsistencies that irritate such as Tony Newman's birthyear in Titanic differed from when he was in Pearl Harbor.

2432917,3,B000BOH8Z0,"This nine-year-old was utterly captivated by The Time Tunnel during its first run in 1966-67. The technology seemed so super-futuristic and weird; had I known the word at the time, I would have called it ""psychedelic."" The situations seemed tense and exciting. I never missed a single episode.

However, I had never seen the show in color -- my family didn't get color TV until 1970 -- so when the DVDs came out, I decided to watch the entire series in broadcast order.

The discs themselves look very good indeed, with fine detail and excellent color and sound. But the show itself ... alas. The years have not been kind.

Only two of the scripts (""The Day The Sky Fell In"" and ""Kill Two By Two,"" both involving WWII in the Pacific) make any interesting use of the time travel theme. Most episodes are either silly (""Revenge of Robin Hood,"" ""The Ghost of Nero""), excruciatingly stupid (""End of the World,"" ""The Walls of Jericho"") or simply dull (""Crack of Doom"", ""Attack of the Barbarians,"" ""The Alamo""). Other ideas show signs of promise (""Secret Weapon,"" ""Chase Through Time"") that is never realized.

Quite a few episodes are unintentionally hilarious, and are worth watching as examples of awful '60s television. ""Visitors From Beyond The Stars"" has Tony and Doug in the clutches of silver aliens who want to harvest ""protein"" from a Wild West ranch. Its authors appear to have been intimately familiar with what the word ""psychedelic"" means. :) ""Merlin the Magician"" features a scene-stealing wizard who can cross time and space at will, shatter metals with a gesture and resurrect the dead, but is unable to take out a castle full of drunk Vikings. Biggest laugh of all may be ""Pirates of Deadman's Island,"" in which a pirate captain runs out of the time tunnel brandishing a cutlass and pistol, snarling ""Arrrr! Whar's me ship?""

It has the typically breatheless (and brainless) Irwin Allen voice-overs, as well as incredibly goofy (even for its era) sparkler-type special effects. Really, really beneath junior high-age stuff.

What is interesting, in a horrible sort of way, is how much footage good ol' Irwin Allen uses from old movies, to pad (and, indeed, determine) the plot of the story.

For example, there is loads of footage from Robert Heinlein's movie ""Destination Moon"" which, by chance, I had watched just the day before I watched the Time Tunnel episode ""One way trip to the Moon"" or whatever. It was so much fun seeing the same footage a second time in a completely different (and inferior, though the movie was 15 years older than the TV show) context! Not! The thing is, they had to have a meteorite hit the ship so that they could use the ""exciting"" space-walk footage from the movie. Ha ha ha ha!

But anyway, I gave it a respectable three stars because some of the actors are engaging and when you buy Irwin Allen you expect junk anyway.

But, the idea is so cool, I do wish Roddenberry had handled it. It would probably be a going franchise even today. There is no substitute for thoughtful intelligence.

We always held hope they would end up back in the tunnel because other people (including Sergeant Jiggs in the Trojan Horse episode) came back. Whats that all about?

Anyway, there are few purchases that give you real enjoyment and the 2 time tunnel volumes really is fun to watch. The quality and colors are excellent.

2432921,5,B000BOH8Z0,"As great as Lost in Space is (and it's certainly a fun favorite), the Time Tunnel may arguably be Irwin Allen's best show due to the fact that it was aimed at an older viewer and thus has more resonance for audiences today.  The premise of the show -- two scientists and friends lost in time visit various points in history -- allowed for much stronger dramatic situations than Allen normally tackled, including much darker thematic elements (such as the episode ""The Alamo"" in which all but one of the side characters dies.)

But the true strength of the show lies in the superb acting of its cast, in particular Robert Colbert and James Darrin who play the shows two leads, Doug and Tony.  Time Tunnel is also rare in that it's a true buddy show, and the actors genuinely display warm affection for each other as they hurtle through time and danger, saving each other as they fall out of the frying pan and into the fire with every passing episode.  Their self-sacrificing heroic qualities are a welcome respite from the obnoxious, callous and self-centered personalities prominent on television and in movies today.

While some have accused the show of being formulaic, the varying shift of writers, locales and situations do create for enough narrative variety to satisfy all but the most critical of viewers.  Critics also cite a shortness of verisimilitude in terms of accurate historicy.  This is still vintage Allen and his first and foremost task was to entertain.  And entertain he does.  There's no shortage of epic battle scenes (seamlessly inserted from older film stock footage), malevolent villains, distress, mayhem and heroics!  That said, one of the great things about this show for younger as well as older viewers is that it inspires a love of history and a desire to read up on the actual events that took place.  And for that, the show deserves applause.

An important element that many viewers and critics fail to notice is that Allen tackles the historical scenarios with a surprisingly balanced perspective.  The nationalistic propoganda so prevalent in that era of American TV is far more muted here (if not altogether absent), as heroes and villains appear on BOTH sides of the argument (this is especially notable in the episode ""Massacre"" about the Battle at Little Big Horn.)  That's a refreshing change.  Not every episode is perfect, however.  ""Revenge of the Gods"" suffers from having the protagonists take sides in the conflict (not to mention providing no explanation why Greek and Trojan characters are speaking English!)  But that's by and large the exception to the rule, as the show maintains considerably good continuity throughout.  As with nearly all sci-fi TV, don't expect the science to be anything but pseudo-science.  If you're focus is on that, you're missing the forest for the trees.

While comparisons to the later Quantum Leap have been made, Time Tunnel is actually a superior offering, free of Bellisario's mawkish, contrived elements (not to mention the crude, less-than-subtle sexual allusions) which occasionally reduced Quantum Leap to mid-eighties TV pablum.

But there is one common factor with Quantum Leap that critics fail to note when they attack the fact that Doug and Tony seem never able to return (while others are retrieved with no problem) and the fact that they keep appearing at crucial historic points, and that is the very science-fiction notion that the Time Tunnel itself is sending Doug and Tom to various hot-spots in history (revealed in the episode ""The Death Trap"" as well as in the novelization.)  This is not unlike Sam's computer in Quantum Leap who may have been responsible for his trips.  And while both computers seem bent on having their heroes aid individuals who got a raw deal the first time round (and who actually could be helped) before their sent on their next ""mission,"" the Time Tunnel focuses on saving lives in and around major events and doesn't waste its heroes time (or its viewers) on winning baseball games!  While that may keep the intensity amped up to 10 most of the time, it also means you have an overwhelming amount of great shows.  Even when Time Tunnel veered into fantasy (which it does in the second half of the season), it still retains its sense of high drama and quality acting which make those episodes all the more memorable and enjoyable.

Overall, the show is a winner on every front.  Aside from the nostalgic value, Time Tunnel boasts great performances, interesting storylines, lovable characters, vivid recreations of history, and an appropriate blend of intense action and drama.

The transfer on these DVDs is also stunning!  This show has NEVER looked better!  I had no idea a 40 year old show could appear so brilliant and sharp!  Thanks goes to Fox for taking the time and effort to clean up and present this show so gorgeously!  Those who complain that Fox split the season up into two box sets should take into consideration that fact (not to mention that each episode was an hour long and boasted 30 episodes in the season!)

The acting and writing are classic campy 60's stuff, but at least they did a good job of taking historical events and personalizing them.  The effects aren't bad (especially the pilot), and the tunnel and control room set still stand the test of time for being the coolest TV show set ever.

What makes the show still interesting i think ,is the many wonderful supporting actors surrounding our two heroes through all the episodes. My only complain is about the numerous fights that DOUG and TONY have with the ennemies. It seems to me that those are set up by a dance choreographer from a musical. Instead of being dramatic,they end up being funny. As for the accuracy of the stories,the settings are perfects,and if a detail or two are missing,let us remember that this was a science-fiction show,not a documentary. It may makes us want to look out our history books again ,which is not a bad thing. I'll certainly get the other set very soon.

2432926,5,B000BOH8Z0,"The Time Tunnel, along with other long-forgotten television shows like The Invaders, Logan's Run and the Planet of the Apes, was always something you could at least see at a Star Trek convention, or even on the sci-fi channel late late at night, if you were really lucky and awake.  Now, it has finally received some proper justification with a DVD release.  Vol. 1 has been well worth the wait for TT fanatics such as myself, who were never able to see any of these episodes.  The premise is that the government in the near future is experimenting with time.  Incredibly scientists and the military work together side-by-side with almost no antagonism or even suspicion of each other's motives. Their common goal is to bring back two scientists who have jumped into the tunnel to prove its effectiveness.  So, each episode finds our hero scientists, Tony and Doug, bouncing back and forth through time to various stops.  Once you get past the continuity issues-each episode finds them freshly clothed in the same suit with no discussion of previous visits to other time zones-this becomes quite a romp.  The first episode is a kind of pedestrian Titanic episode where Tony and Doug are caught in one of the worst naval disasters of the 20th century and discover that history can and won't be changed.  Highlight episodes from Vol. 1 include:  The Day The Sky Fell In-where Tony tries to solve the mystery of his dad's disappearance just before Pearl Harbor; Night Of The Long Knives-a nail biter of an episode with Kipling helping Tony and Doug prevent an Afghani uprising at the height of the Anglo-Russo Great Game in Central Asia at the close of the 19th century; The Last Patrol-Tony and Doug arrive just before an infamous bloody battle at the close of 1812.  The extras are very respectable.  There is an alternate version of the pilot episode, photo galleries, radio spots, sketches of art for certain episodes, and even comic books!  The transfer is very high quality-both picture and sound were crystal clear for myself.  The only issue I have is the continuance of many new DVD releases to be two-sided.  This increases the propensity of flawed DVDs.  I've had problems with some of these in the past, and although stores are pretty good about replacing these sets, it is still inconvenient to make the trip.

2432927,4,B000BOH8Z0,"To everybody who talk badly about this show, here goes some possible explanations:

1) Why does Tony and Doug always arrive in a crucial moment of History? Answer: we can assume there are a lot of occasions when they land in innocent moments in time. Then the scientists try (as always - and failing as always...) to get them back, and sometimes they land in important times.

2) Why Tony and Doug did not respect the line of time and always tried to change events? Answer: they are basically good people, and act by instinct, unable to allow, coldly, a tragedy to happen before their eyes.

3)Why does everybody, in any part and time of the world, can speak English? Answer: Ok, this is a hard one... Maybe Irwin Allen did not care at all... Since we can not reasonably suppose that Tony and Doug knew all those languages (from Spanish through Ancient Greek), this is a monumental flaw of the show...

4) Why does Tony and Doug's clothes always stay clean? Answer: this is a silly question. It's not impossible that they clean them in a river in some of the possible times that they arrive in a quiet place. Anyway, this would not prevent terrible deterioration of the clothes, since they were always fighting. A possibel explantation is that, each time they were pulled back from a determined point in time, it was like it never had occurred, so thing went back to before.

5) Why Tic Toc team never manages to get Doug and Tony back, but a lot of undesired people come crawling through the tunnel? Answer: It's demonstrated during the episodes, A LOT OF TIMES, how tricky the Time Tunnel's operational procedures are, how the energy necessary to operate it is unstable, and how the Tunnel was put into action before the scheduled time.",1151193600,2,1738,4.611650485436893

Although my favorite of his early work is the incidental music for Gilligan's Island, this and shows like Lost in Space have some great musical moments, thanks to a master-in-the-making.

Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly towards a new fantastic adventure, somewhere along the infinite corridors of time.""

""The Time Tunnel"" only aired on Friday night on ABC for a year, but those of us who were kids at the time and liked science fiction have fond memories of the short-lived series.  Dr. Tony Newman (James Darren) and Dr. Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert) were a pair of scientists working on Project Tick-Tock, the Time Tunnel, beneath the Arizona desert.  About to get their funding cut off by Congress, Tony went through the Tunnel before it was fully tested and found himself on the H.M.S. ""Titanic.""  To save Tony, Doug followed, and the two were unstuck in time, jumping from one historical event to the next without being able to get back home.  Back at the Tunnel you found General Haywood Kirk (Whit Bissel) in charge, with Dr. Raymond Swain (John Zaremba) and Dr. Ann MacGregor (former Miss America Lee Meriwether) running the science part of the show (and pretty much making up the rules from one week to the next).

There are several reasons that ""The Time Tunnel"" was appealing to us when we were kids.  First, Tony and Doug got to go back in time to see famous events along with a few fantastic ones in the future.  In this first volume we get to visit the ""Titanic"" (""Rendezvous with Yesterday""), travel to the Moon (""One Way to the Moon""), see Halley's Comet panicked people (""End of the World""), be there for the Attack on Pearl Harbor (""The Day the Sky Fell In"") and the Battle of New Orleans (""The Last Patrol""), have to get away from the explosion of Krakatoa (""Crack of Doom""), see the end of the Trojan War (""Revenge of the Gods""), avoid the Battle of the Little Big Horn (""Massacre""), be sent to ""Devil's Island,"" get caught up in the ""Reign of Terror"" of the French Revolution, check out a Soviet Time Tunnel (""The Death Trap""), and show up at the last day of the siege of ""The Alamo.""  Even better, everybody takes in in stride that they meet Ulysses one ""week,"" General Custer the next, and then Captain Dreyfuss.  ""The Day the Sky Fell"" stands out because actually the point is that nothing happens, but that is because of the Time Tunnel.

Second, whenever warranted by the story, creator-producer Irwin Allen uses scenes from theatrical films to dress up the production.  So for the ""Titanic"" episode we have scenes from ""A Night to Remember,"" while for ""Revenge of the Gods"" they use clips from another cherish movie from the past, ""The 300 Spartans.""  Recognizing the movie being used is also part of the fun. Third, you can see some future stars in their early days including Ellen Burstyn (then Ellen McRae) and Tom Skerritt.  Two of the better performances are turned in by Carroll O'Connor, who plays a pair of British commanding officers a hundred and fifty year apart in ""The Last Patrol"" and Ford Rainey as Abraham Lincoln in ""The Death Trap.""  Plus, I think my second crush on a television actress was on Lee Meriwether, just for ""The Time Tunnel"" and not for playing Catwoman on ""Batman"" (the first was on Mary Tyler Moore as Laura Petrie).

But what I love the most about this series is that for the most part Tony and Doug jump around in time without any concern for what they are doing to the time line.  They land on the ""Titanic"" and try to convince Captain Smith (Michael Rennie) that the ship is going to hit an iceberg and sink.  They fail, but do they ever consider the classic time travel paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather before your father is born which means you were never born to go back and kill your grandfather?  No, they do not.  When they are at Pearl Harbor we learn that Tony's father was killed there when he was a boy.  Back in the Tunnel somebody points out that instead of saving the adult Tony they have to make sure the younger Tony survives.  Gee, if little Tony dies would big Tony disappear.  It is theoretically possible, admits Dr. Swain.  Gee, Doc, YA THINK?  Even when Abraham Lincoln dismisses the idea that killing him in Baltimore in 1861 before he is inaugurated would change history, no light bulb goes off for Doug.  Where is there a Time Travel Ethicist when you need one?  But, as I hope to indicate, this silliness is part of the fun.  I have not even begun to talk about what happens when the Tunnel starts plucking people from the past and bringing them to the future and then sending them back.  To be fair, the ""theory"" here is clearly that Tony and Doug were at these historical events the first time around, so that they have always been part of history and not agents of change.

The important thing is that it is all great fun and if you have ever imagined yourself at the Alamo or wondered what you would say to Abraham Lincoln if you went back to the past and met him, then you can appreciate glorious nonsense like this television series.  My greatest joy in this coming out on DVD is that almost forty years later I finally got to see the episode ""Revenge of the Gods,"" which is set during the Trojan War.  I saw the epilogue at the end of the previous episode that would become the prologue for the next, so I knew there was an episode about the Trojan Horse coming up, but for some reason on October 21, 1966, I missed seeing the episode.  There are only 13 episodes for Volume 1, but another 17 on Volume 2, which will give you the entire run of the series.  You cannot stop here because there are still encounters with Robin Hood, Billy the Kid, Cortez, Genghis Khan, and Merlin ahead for Tony and Doug.  There are also those time-hopping aliens, but how can you top Machiavelli at the Battle of Gettysburg?",1148083200,10,5835,4.5353053435114505
2432932,3,B000BOH8Z0,"Let's put it this way: the first fifteen minutes of the first episode are the best of the run.  I still love to watch the command car disappear under the desert and it's still fun to look down 800 stories into the earth.  After that, it's typical Irwin Allen tedium.  A little greasepaint and glitter and there's your alien.  The wonders of the world explored with a trunkload of period costumes and a couple of cheesy sets.  I was twelve when these episodes first appeared and, truth be told, they were pretty tedious even back then.  I remember hoping that next week's episode would be better than the one I just watched.

I have the most fun watching for the flashing light control panels that seem to make the rounds from Time Tunnel to Lost in Space to Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to Land of the Giants.

When it went off the air, I went 30+ years, just being able to tell my friends and family about this show, without any chance to see it again.  Then, a few years ago, the Sci-Fi Network put it on!  Imagine how excited I was! Now I own it on DVD!!

What I loved most about this show was it's premise -- time travel and the ability to actually ""see"" the important events of history.  This show literally made me a history buff, and throughout my lifetime, I've gone out of my way to go to the same historical locations as in the Time Tunnel episodes (ie, the Alamo, Little Bighorn, Battle of New Orleans).  To answer all of you who complain that it isn't ""realistic"" that they'd ONLY land in these pivotal historic events, I always told myself that they likely DID also land in non-exciting times and places, but the TV show just doesn't show us those landings.  Thus, I assumed, TV was only showing us a ""greatest hits"" of Tony & Doug's ""fantastic adventures"".

A few questions for other Time Tunnel fans:

(1) Were the 1966-1967 ratings really so bad?  My memory (from a 9-year-old) was that the show actually had pretty decent ratings, but it was just too expensive to make.  Any truth to that?

(2) Does anyone agree with me that, by far, the show's episodes in the ""future"" were by far it's weakest?

(3) Any rumors of an upcoming movie based on the show?",1145577600,6,1570,4.3944636678200695

2432941,4,B000BOH8Z0,"The TIME TUNNEL appeared in the Irwin Allen decade.  Allen's shows, LOST IN SPACE, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE TIME TUNNEL, and LAND OF THE GIANTS ruled television sci-fi in the 1960s.  Unfortunately for the THE TIME TUNNEL, the series survived but one season.  No doubt the fact that it's time slot pitted the series against HOGAN'S HEROES contributed to the show's demise.

The plot is brilliantly simple.  Two American scientists become the world's first time travelers.  Unfortunately, once they enter the Time Tunnel, they and the control room crew have no control over where and when they will appear next.  Despite efforts to retrieve them, Tony and Doug appear destined to randomly travel to and fro in time for the remainder of their lives.

Sound a little like QUANTUM LEAP?

Once again I have to revert to my childhood memories of this show.  The Time Tunnel control room set was one of the coolest parts of the show.  I did not care much for the hand-me-down backlot sets for the time travel stories.  The best part of the show was watching the tunnel light up, pyrotechnics pop, and the (borrowed Jupiter 2) sound effects kick into high gear as the crew try -- yet again -- to retrieve the time travelers.

It was not until years later that I realized that Irwin Allen borrowed heavily from 20th Century Fox's film catalog to pad the episodes with film clips for action and cast-of-thousands sequences that would otherwise be unaffordable on a television series budget.

Where the episode plot is based on actual historical events, the characters introduce snippets of historical fact in the best tradition of The History Channel.  In fact, while watching the episode ""End of the World,"" I was intrigued enough to pull out the encyclopedia and look up information on Halley's Comet.

Yes, this was another television show that has kids re-enacting the previous night's episode.  The only disagreement we had in playing Time Tunnel was that no one wanted to be Doug. Tony (James Darren) was the favorite.  Unfortunately, the garage was a poor stand in for a kid's Time Tunnel.  Something about the snow tires against the back wall and lawnmower parked on the side that tarnished the effect.

At one time I even had a Viewmaster 3-D  disk of the pilot episode.  That was a unique experience for me as previously I had only seen the show in black and white -- and thus remember the series in black and white on my old Philco-Ford television set.  That is where this DVD release is so special.  The picture is crisp, clear, and rich in color.  The release of this set was no rushed affair as the quality is exceedingly high.  The only shortcoming of this DVD release is that the episodes are imprinted on two-sided disks.  Although this process takes up less room, it also increases the probability of getting dirt and fingerprints on DVDs.  You have to be a little more cautious in handling the DVDs.

Like many classic television shows, TIME TUNNEL's one season run made it difficult to syndicate.  With the exception of its appearance on a digital cable television channel, the only other time I saw a rebroadcast episode of the TIME TUNNEL was in the early 1980s when TBS had two episodes edited together as a movie.

Hey, about about that John(ny) Williams opening theme for the show?  You do not have to listen too carefully to hear occasional similarities in style to Mr. Williams' later blockbuster film scores.

TIME TUNNEL's first season is being issued in two parts.  This first volume has some special features including a lot of silent home movies taken on various sets.  Wow.  These were some high quality home movies.  My eight millimeter home movies never looked that good.  Irwin Allen's home movies are lengthy too.  It is a shame that they are not accompanied by some sort of narrative or pop-up triva.

If you judge TIME TUNNEL by today's television production standards, you will probably be disappointed.  However, if you imagine yourself back in the 1960s when you were limited to three network television stations  -- and no VCRs -- you can easily imagine why the TIME TUNNEL was an eagerly awaited weekly show.",1142726400,6,4153,4.759103641456583

My family did not have a color tv so the ""In Color"" tag really meant nothing to me.  This was the Irwin Allen show I was allowed to watch all of.  The ""monsters"" on Voyage used to scare m, so my parents did not allow me to watch the show.

I was so enchanted by watching Tony and Doug travel the infinite corridors of time, never knowing where they would land.  I was always bothered by such an expensive investment not being able to do the job.  Substandard materials must always be involved in time machines (see Quantum Leap - someting went ka-ka), I just never understood why Ray or Ann could never fix the tunnel.

When I first heard that this was coming to dvd, I thought it was a joke.  A nearly 40 year old one season show.  Suffice it to say, I am very pleased with the job FOX did in bringing this set to dvd.  I have never seen it look this good.  I am impressed with the color and clarity of the episodes.

It was amazing to me (back then) that the two travellers always landed at the exact time and place where something historical was happening, not just in the middle of a dull Monday in some boring office somewhere etc.

Now, when I watch them again, I see a computer that doesn't work so well most of the time...it can bring others back and forth through time to the right place, and the staff can talk to the travellers, but they can never seem to bring them back because it breaks at a crucial moment, kind of like Windows does today.

The quality of each DVD is good and the special effects and technology was probably state-of-the-art for the 60's.  Although, some of the historical facts may not be entirely accurate, the show still creates a feeling of nostalgia for anyone who watched it while it was on the air.

2432961,5,B000BOH8Z0,"If you grew up during the 1960's and had the pleasure of watching this show when it first aired on ABC in the Fall of 1966, get ready for a treat.  20th Century Fox has banked this crown jewel of Irwin Allen's for nearly forty-years and only now has the technology been available for them to release it in it's entirety with the color and clarity that it truly deserves.  You probably already know what the show is about so I won't go into that, what I will mention is the bonus material that makes this a must have for any 'Time Tunnel' fan.  First off, you get like an hours worth of behind-the-scenes film footage that was filmed during the making of the show's pilot episode, 'Rendezvous With Yesterday.'  In it, you see Irwin, various assistants and cameramen setting up the scenes before they 'roll the cameras.'  As all of the film is in color, it's almost like being there.  During the filming of the outdoor desert scenes, you can almost feel the chill in the air as you see the cast and crewmembers bundled-up in coats trying to stay warm during their breaks between shots.  James Darren and Robert Colbert are caught on film either smoking a cigarette or talking to the crew.  The other bonus material is that of the network promos that ABC ran during the show's short-lived '66-'67 run.  One in particular is a great 30-second commercial that opens with the narrator saying, 'when you enter the Time Tunnel, you never know what will happen' and showing clips from various episodes.  Then, the closing graphics say 'Fridays - 8:00, 7:00 Central, In Color.'  This DVD set shows that the studio (Fox) put a lot of thought and effort into it.  More DVD sets of retro shows like this should include network promos, screen tests of the actors and such.  If you are interested in Sci-Fi but never watched this show, let me say that it's a good production and though it doesn't have the CGI effects and sophisticated plots by todays standards, it's still an adventure to watch.  Keep in mind that the sets on this show were built by some of the most talented set designers and craftsmen around and the pilot was the most expensive ever produced up to that time.  The 'Tunnel' set itself was so large that it needed TWO soundstages!  There's NO Sun Solaris, Macintosh or Cray supercomputer generated stuff here!  Everything you see is, for the most part, real.  Buy this and enjoy some of the best Sci-Fi TV to ever blanket the airwaves.  Thank-you Fox!",1140912000,3,2456,4.578947368421052
2432962,5,B000BOH8Z0,"I am one television season younger than Time Tunnel so unlike most of the reviewers here I was not yet around when this Irwin Allen classic first graced the airwaves.  I'd like to encourage DVD collectors who are my age and younger to give this set a try.  It's true that television has changed greatly over the last four decades. That change has not always been for the best.  Time Tunnel may look outdated to some but the main essence of this show does not lie in the reused sets, awkward dialogue, and primitive special effects.  The main essence is in the dynamic cast that made this show come to life regardless of all the inconsistencies and numerous silver-faced aliens that showed up from time to time.

Time Tunnel is one of the most enjoyable ""buddy shows"" ever made.  Tony and Doug (James Darren and Robert Colbert) share a great camaraderie.  Their colleagues back in the tunnel complex (played by Whit Bissell, Lee Meriwether, and John Zaremba) are equally devoted to their work and their efforts to get Tony and Doug back home.  Examples of dedication, trust, loyalty, and friendship abound in Time Tunnel.  This fact alone distinguishes it from most of the TV series currently airing today.

While it's true that today's special effects are much more sophisticated, one must remember that Time Tunnel was the most expensive show airing during its era.  Personally, I don't mind seeing the same palm trees, props, and jungle foliage from episode to episode.  The cast made it all work beautifully - and they didn't need the quick, strobe-like edits and nauseating camera moves to help convey action and suspense like you find in today's action/adventure fare.

After spending a decade wearing out old VHS recordings of Time Tunnel from the Sci-Fi Channel, this DVD set is a joy to watch!  The quality is stunning and the episodes are complete - a feat Columbia House Video could not achieve with their eighteen-episode VHS release several years ago.  Of the twelve episodes not released by Columbia House, only two are in this VOL. 1 set!  Needless to say I'm looking forward to VOL. 2!

This DVD set features some wonderful extras: network promos, the unaired pilot, Irwin Allen's home movies of the making of the Time Tunnel pilot (a tale set aboard the RMS Titanic), and photos of Time Tunnel memorabilia.  A picture of the Time Tunnel Board Game is featured among the collectibles.  I've seen only one of these games in person at the Titanic Historical Society Museum and the game's cover art is beautifully reproduced in this DVD set.  Interestingly, Time Tunnel's pilot episode is well-known among Titanic scholars and is mentioned in several books about the doomed ocean liner.  This was how I discovered Time Tunnel as I've been one of those scholars since the ripe old age of ten.  Who says that great books can't lead the way to great, classic television?

The VOL. 1 set of Time Tunnel belongs in everyone's DVD collection even if you're too young to remember the series.  Watch the episodes and become a new fan.  This can happen - it's only a matter of time!",1140825600,7,3085,4.764595103578155
2432963,4,B000BOH8Z0,"After 40 years it was neat to see this old show again.

FOX does this because many retailers won't carry high priced DVD sets.  They do not do it to rip you off, as I previously thought.",1140566400,3,427,4.182926829268292
2432967,1,B000BOH8Z0,"I did not grow up watching Time Tunnel when it originally aired but wanted to see this series because I love time travel themed stories. The first episode (Titanic) was fun but every episode after that seemed like a carbon copy. Every episode follows the same pattern: duo lands somewhere in time (on the Titanic, at the Alamo) where a bad event is going to happen; they attempt to tell someone of the bad event so they can prevent it; that someone thinks they're crazy and locks them up; they finally get someone to believe them and escape; they are unable to stop the bad event from happening; they are then transported to a new period of time; repeat episode. After a few episodes it got pretty boring. Since I don't have the same nostalgia for it as probably most of the viewers buying this set I guess I didn't appreciate it as much. I wanted to like it but can't recommend it. If you've never seen the series I'd say rent it but hold off on buying it.",1140393600,22,957,4.351955307262569

 This seems to be the newest plot in rapidly separating the consumers from their money, PT Barnum said it best ""There's a SUCKER born every  minute"" If you buy TV on DVD lately, put the word SUCKER on your forehead

 Studios take years releasing the public's favorite shows on DVD. You know  when they do, some studios  only release half seasons or part of the whole. The studio is  releasing only 16 of the 32 episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea's First Season. I'm sure Vol. 2 will be out in 6 montrhs to a year. If my math serves me right it  mean there are going to be  8 separate  box sets (yes Virginia, it seems like it will be  E I G H T ) to cover the entire 4 season run of voyage shows. Disney did it for their Swamp Fox and Elfago Baca box set last xmas time, with NO IDEA when the rest of Fox or Baca shows will be released..  Fox released Lost in Space in five  box sets for the show's three seasons.  MGM/UA broke up the recent Magnificent Seven TV incarnation of 23 episodes into the first nine (first season) to be a companion of the re-release of the 1960 movie, with NO IDEA when set two is being planned or released . Now Fox is breaking up X-Files into story arcs for $30 a pop as well as having all nine box sets available....All I hope is they don't do that for show 24.

You know we're waiting for these classic shows! For those fans of classic TV, Fox and other studios see us coming...So  as a result, you expel as much more money for good classics on TV. I don't say BOYCOTT, that would be stupid and you won't get the shows you crave on DVD. Just send the studio a note that you don't like whats going on

Now to cases - the Time Tunnel episodes will be in 2 sets and it was only ran for one season! The  price is about $35 a set, so a full season should be $70 or more-I see their price point, $30 to $40-people buy DVD ...$70. Not always do they buy! There is NO IDEA when set two is coming. FOX let someone know soon when Tunnel set two is coming-okay?

So is the first set of Tunnel worth it?...YOU BET YOUR TAIL IT IS!  All these 15 classic episodes in this box set are great classic television and crisper on DVD.  The show  does not date itself that much for a 40 year old show and still is very watchable. You can see where such TV shows like Quantum Leap, Voyagers, Sliders and even Stargate SG1 all got their start from Time Tunnel.  The show is VERY  well done. Producer  Irwin Allen always spent money on his  SF shows and you can see it in all his TV work . Look at Voyage, Tunnel, Space or Land of the Giants, you see the money is on the screen-from talent to sets. . What I love is classic TV, the quality is there-shows had thought...not like today's shoot up.

The Extras on the last disk is great.... TV and Radio spots, a few comics (one Goldkey and one Japanese0 in a still gallery, Home movies of filming the pilot. One would hope James Darren can do an audio narration for an episode  for volume two for that is the only thing that missing on volume one.

Fox just hurry up with volume two

2432969,3,B000BOH8Z0,"Synopsis:  Leading America's top secret Time Tunnel project, two improbably-handsome physicists, Tony Newman and Doug Phillips, become lost in time when an experiment goes awry.  Because the time tunnel has not been perfected, instead of being returned to the project complex, they wind up being moved randomly to different times and places, typically at pivotal moments in history.

The show featured excellent color, photography, and set design (the tunnel itself was a masterpiece).  It was the writing that was the weak link.  Although much better overall and less formulaic than producer Irwin Allen's other well-known series like Lost In Space and Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, it never moved beyond putting Doug and Tony into physical danger each week, leaving little room for the important elements of characterization and theme.  The dramatic potential was further hampered by the need to work the Time Tunnel personnel into each episode as they try without success to bring the two men back home, which meant there were two unrelated storylines each episode instead of an integrated plot.

Fox has done a first-rate job restoring and converting the original films to DVD, allowing us to more fully appreciate how good the show must have looked when it was new, at least for those few who had color TV back then (I only saw it in black and white myself).  Highly recommended for sci-fi fans, history buffs, cinematography aficionados, and anyone else who wants to see what Friday night television was like in 1966.",1140048000,4,1526,5.051792828685259

2432972,4,B000BOH8Z0,"Irwin Allen's shortest series was possibly his most ambitious: an adventure wherein its two protagonists, Drs. Tony Newman (James Darren) and Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert), are flung throughout time, allowing them to coincidentally arrive at important historical dates, real and imaginary.  All of the producer's trademarks are present: lots of flashy bells and whistles, gobs of pyrotechnics, pseudo science, stereotypical roles of men and women, political incorrectness, and cost-conscious use of studio stock footage and music.

Sure, there are abundances of plot inconsistencies and errors but Allen was more concerned with making entertaining and audience-pleasing fare than accuracy or even logical storytelling.  Strangely enough, it's ironic that in 1966, when the show debuted, the country was in the in the midst of the Civil Rights movement, the beginnings of America's involvement in the war in southeast Asia, and the successes of the space program.  Only the latter is addressed in any of the episodes, Allen preferring to take the ""easy road"" and not tackling social issues of the day.  A couple of installments hit at social commentary with a line or two but most of the series is pure escapism.

The special effects, mostly in the Time Tunnel complex itself, are impressive when one considers the time of the show's production.

The main stars, along with Whit Bissell, John Zaremba, and Lee Meriwether, do their best to make the show's impossible premise believable, even wih the stilted and, occasional, laughable dialogue.  Though they don't appear in most episodes, supporting players Wesley Lau (Sgt. Jiggs) and Sam Groom (Jerry) fill out Allen's usual seven-member, or so, cast, found in each of the sci-fi series in Allen's stable.

Allen's ""reparatory company"" (actors that appeared in two or more of the filmmaker's productions, television or theatrical) includes Kevin Hagen, John Crawford, Abraham Sofaer, Dee Hartford, Paul Carr, Victor Lundan, Michael Opatoshu, Nehemiah Persoff, Torin Thatcher, Michael Ansara, Malachi Throne, Ford Rainey, and Gary Merrill.  Some even appear in more than one of the first fifteen installments, featured in this set.

Michael Rennie (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Lost in Space's"" only two-parter, ""The Keeper"") appears in the pilot episode ""Rendezvous with Yesterday"".  Coincidentally, Rennie also provided the opening and closing narration for the 1953 film ""Titanic,"" a film whose footage is incorporated in much of ""The Time Tunnel"" pilot.

Susan Flannery (now on the soap ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" and Golden Globe winner for Allen's ""The Towering Inferno"") appears in ""The Day the Sky Fell In,"" James Darren's favorite episode.

The show also showcased many future stars of the small and large screen: Carroll O'Connor (forever TV's ""Archie Bunker""), Tom Skerritt (""Alien"" and TV's ""Pickett Fences""), Jim Davis (""Jock Ewing"" of ""Dallas"") and Academy Award-winner Ellen Burstyn (""The Exorcist"" and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""), billed here as ""Ellen McCrae"" in the episode ""Crack of Doom"".

""The Time Tunnel"" may not rank as a highpoint in television drama but for a boy of the 60's, it offered a journey of the imagination and inspired a lifelong appreciation and fondness for history.

And that, is Irwin Allen's legacy...even if it was at the expense of James Darren's must-be-awfully-rancid-time-traveling-green turtleneck!",1139616000,2,3413,5.4356060606060606
2432973,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I loved this show when I was a kid back in the 1960's.  I bought it mainly for the ""blast from the past"" effect, but I was amazed at how well it has aged.  I expected it to be a bit cheesy, but I am greatly enjoying watching these episodes uncut and in their original broadcast order.

The picture quality is outstanding.  When this show originally aired (and I've had cable TV much of my life and never saw it being rerun) you were lucky if you got to see it on a round, sort of fuzzy 25"" RCA console TV.  Now watching it on my LCD TV and even a modern small TV with a flat tube and DVD resolution and it's just plain gorgeous.

Of course, it doesn't pay to think much while watching this show.  If you do, you start asking questions like...

Why can't Tony develop some interpersonal skills instead of always starting fist fights by being brash and impatient?

Why did they jump into a time tunnel with no ID or anything to prove who they were and where they came from?

Isn't it great that the Time Tunnel also doubles as a great drycleaner?  Doug and Tony's outfits are always freshly cleaned and pressed at the end of each time shift no matter how dirty they get during the episode.

Wouldn't one spoof episode have been great?  What if Doug and Tony had landed during a long Sunday morning church service in colonial America and had to stay awake during the sermon?

And, no Star Trek like reverence for the time line here!  If you've got the chance to save the Titanic, you do it!  You'd only change history for the better, right?

Anyway, it's still a fun show.  The bonus of Irwin Allen's home movies are fascinating, and there are a lot of them!

I deducted a star because these are double sided DVDs.  I would have been happy to pay a little more and get single-sided discs, which are much less vulnerable to damage.",1138924800,13,1827,4.286549707602339

2432975,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I remember when the series premiered on September 9th, 1966. The day before, Star Trek premiered on NBC with The Man Trap. For a 10 year old kid in Pittsburgh, that was interesting, but the Time Tunnel premiere was more impressive. I remember reading in the Post Gazette that the original pilot cost over 1.7 million (remember, that was in 1966 dollars). My grandparents arrived from California just before the broadcast began right after the Green Hornet.

We had just gotten an RCA color TV the Wednesday before, and Star Trek sure made watching color TV fun, but the Time Tunnel pilot was totally impressive. The matte shots in the early part of the pilot, ""Rendevous With Yesterday"" were AWFULLY impressive on a 25 inch RCA color TV screen. The idea and concept of the pilot were just awesome. I still remember Grandpa and Grandma talking about the Titanic as if it was yesterday. (I regret not having a tape recorder to capture everything they said). After the third episode, End of the World, Grandpa talked at legnth about what went on in 1910, the ACTUAL hysteria whipped up by newspapers because Earth orbit actually crossed over Halley's arc. Millions of people bought ""comet pills"" or potions, which were supposed to protect them from the effects of cyanide gas generated from the comet. Grandma swore that one of those tonics at that time eventually was relabeled GERITOL.

Years later, in 1985, I remember coming home and seeing Halley's. You could barely make it out. Grandma remembered in 1910, it covered a quarter of the sky then. I got grandma to run out and see it. She turned her head and said ""Such a dissapointment, That TV Show was more fun"". a bittersweet memory triggered by the inventive mind of Irwin Allen which brought happy memories to a 10 year old kid in Pittsburgh.

I was dissapointed with Fox's release of Lost in Space to DVD, and I was hoping they would take more care with Time Tunnel. Fox DID take more care. There are generally four episodes per disc, this time there are two on each side, Time Tunnel never looked or sounded better. Also, FOX did an excellent captioning. of the 12 episodes I've checked, I see no dropped or misspelled words (which was a MAJOR irritation with the LIS release).

An added treat are the bonus materials. ""Irwin's Home Movies"" are quite interesting, You also get James Darren's audio bumpers which we always heard at the end of the Green Hornet, and the preview trailers which went with the first three episodes. The only things missing are the network bumpers at the start and end.

Two reason I give the set 4 instead of 5 stars 1) is that I wished Fox would have let Jim Darren, Bob Colbert and Lee Meriweather do a commentary track even on just one episode, It would have been a special treat to hear them talk about what went on during the filming of an episode and 2) The unaired pilot was originally 90 minutes and had a lot of scenes featuring Dennis Hopper as Althea's boyfriend. These were almost all cut out of the revised unaired pilot. UCLA supposedly has a working print of the 90 minute pilot, it would have been very interesting to see it.

After all these years, I've got the first 15 episodes of Time Tunnel, I'm waiting anxiously for the last 15. But I can combine them with The Avengers and return with very happy memories that a 10 year old kid had of watching ABC on Friday nights in 1966. Now, when do we get The Green Hornet on DVD, Fox?",1138752000,72,3433,4.564935064935065
2432976,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I've been telling my wife for some time now that there are a few shows that I used to watch when I was a kid that I simply MUST have on DVD. They made a huge impact on my psyche and bring back extremely fond memories. It probably comes as no surprised to anyone reading this that most of those shows were created by Irwin Allen, the master of low-budget costuming and scenery as well as the hokey story line.

After buying every Lost in Space DVD released (that was my favorite childhood show!), I began to tell my wife, ""You know, I remember a show about time travel...Hmmm...what was it called?""

She didn't grow up with Lost in Space and, frankly, found the show to be tedious and completely implausible. (Although she loves Dr. Smith, the Robot and Will Robinson and often jokingly says, ""Oh, the pain. The pain."") So when I began to go on and about another Irwin Allen show, she was less than enthused.

Not long after that -- great day in the morning! -- I saw a notice on Amazon that Time Tunnel was about to be released on DVD! I almost jumped in the air and clicked my heals. We lost no time (no pun intended) buying Time Tunnel and have begun watching it. (More about that in a moment.)

The other childhood show I can't wait to see again is Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, another Irwin Allen extravaganza. I'll own Voyage the second it's released. (I seem to recall Voyage being somewhat cooler and more believable than Time Tunnel and Lost in Space, but I could be wrong. Memories fade after 35 years or so.)

Another show I used to watch when I was a kid is nowhere near DVD release. In fact, I doubt anyone even remembers it: The Sixth Sense with Gary Collins. It was an early '70s show that, from I recall, never failed to scare the bejeezus out of me. Anyone know when -- or, more likely, IF -- The Sixth Sense TV show will be released on DVD?

Back to Time Tunnel. And Voyage. And Irwin Allen.

The reason for my lengthy pre-amble is to explain the fact that for many of us, the shows we're buying now on DVD were important to us as kids: Lost in Space. Time Tunnel. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. As a kid, everything seems cool, larger than life, and unforgettable. Images from the aforementioned shows have stuck with me for close to 40 years. It's probably safe to say that what I watched as a kid BECAME part of me, helped to form the person I am today. That's a lot to ask from a TV show, but I think it's true.

I'm not a kid any more. And my definition of cool has changed considerably in the past 35+ years.

So how does Time Tunnel rate watching it today?

So-so. It's great to hear the signature John Williams score (sounds a lot like the work he did for Lost in Space!), Dick Tufeld's voice as the show's announcer (Dick was the voice of the Robot as well as the announcer for Lost in Space), plus see the cheesy sets, costumes and props. Given the benefit of hindsight, I can see how Quantum Leap drew a lot from Time Tunnel. Same premise. Better stories.

The Time Tunnel DVD set is great. Well done. Although it uses double-sided DVDs (which are prone to defect), the picture and sound quality are pristine. Very crisp.

We've watched a bunch of episodes and the overwhelming feeling we have is this: ""Man, these seem long."" Granted, part of that is due to the fact that there were fewer commercial breaks back then. And, so, more program to watch. However, I think some of our feelings about the show are similar to how we feel about the Nineties show Nowhere Man.

Any show -- like Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, Nowhere Man -- that has a closed story line (meaning, the parameters are set and never change) may be brilliant and fun to watch. But after a while, the sameness sets in and it starts to feel tired.

Time Tunnel is no exception. The concept, back then, was novel. Two scientists trapped in time, bouncing from one time to another. But, today, when shows like Lost and 24 have blown the closed story line all to hell, programs like Time Tunnel seem very, very tame.

That's not to say that Time Tunnel isn't enjoyable. I think it's very enjoyable. But probably more from the perspective of nostalgia and wide-eyed innocense than exceptional writing, acting and cinematography.

If you grew up in the Sixties and Seventies, you should buy this DVD set. Chances are, you watched some episodes of Time Tunnel when you were a kid. So seeing them again will be fun.

If you didn't grow up during that era, but you'd like to know what passed for quality TV entertainment at the time, you should buy this DVD set. Don't expect to be riveted as you would watching 24 or Lost. Rather, watch it almost like you just opened a time capsule (again, no pun intended) and you want to know what life was like for children of the Sixties and early Seventies.

Time Tunnel doesn't represent the best TV has ever offered. But it does represent a very nice slice of nostalgia, almost innocense, from an era long past.",1138752000,22,4944,4.36126224156692
2432977,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I bought this collection and it contained 2 disk #1's.  Well after straightening that out, I set out to enjoy the memories. Great cheezy sci-fi, always thought it would be great for one episode, in X-files style, to take a humorous look at Doug and Tony landing in a most normal circumstance, with no cash or ID.",1138492800,,312,4.473684210526316
2432978,4,B000BOH8Z0,"For a kid in 1966 TV was a treasure trove of fun. ""Star Trek"", ""Rat Patrol"" and ""The Time Tunnel"" all debuted during the same year. Although ""Star Trek"" had the respectable pedigree with involvement from science fiction writers, ""The Time Tunnel"" had the feature film expertise of Irwin Allen (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""The Towering Inferno"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", The Swiss Family Robinson"", ""The Towering Inferno"") and the might of 20th Century Fox behind it. While some of the episodes could be quite corny the initial batch of episodes for the series had a fun and adventurous quality. More of a fantasy series than a science fiction show, the premise was fairly simple. The U.S. government has been secretly investing in the next great step in science after the creation of the atomic bomb; sending a man back in time to observe what occurred in the past and preventing our enemies from altering the time line similar. It was a race so to speak for time-control of our past. When a senator (Gary Merril) threatens to cut the funding for the defense department project Project Tic Tock, Dr. Tony Newman (James Darren) uses the device to prove that it works. Newman ends up on the Titanic and must try and convince the captain to prevent the sinking of the ship so that Dr. Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert) Dr. Raymond Swain (John Zaremba) and Dr. Ann MacGregor (Lee Meriwether) can bring him back. Newman also has the chance to avert one of the worst disasters in sea faring history. Philips goes after Newman in hopes of bringing him back and both become unstuck in time (to borrow from Kurt Vonnegut) randomly drifting through the past and the future. A show that later inspired ""Quantum Leap"", ""The Time Tunnel"" surprisingly only ran one season on ABC and was one of Allen's four science fiction shows of the 60's (the others were ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" which debuted in 1964 and was based on Allen's film, ""Lost in Space"" which aced out ""Star Trek"" at CBS-the show eventually ended up at NBC-and ""Land of the Giants"" all imaginative if not scientifically accurate or even well written). What Newman and Phillips discover is that you can't change the outcome of episodes in the past (although  they do seem to have an impact on the future).

 Fox has gone produced a beautiful transfer for the show. The images are crisp with a large amount of detail (and look superior to the second and third seasons of ""Lost in Space""). The color is rich and bold with nice flesh tones and there's little in the way of compression issues and edge enhancement to mar the images. The mono sound comes across with remarkable clarity and little distortion. A very sharp nice looking and sounding transfer from Fox. The only complaint I have is that the 30 episodes are spread out over a two volume set. While I'm not a fan of dual sided discs these sets look and sound extremely good.

First up we get the original unaired pilot which had an alternate ending and additional scenes cut before the pilot aired. The pilot had for its time some spectacular visual effects. We also get over an hour of 8 millimeter footage shot on the set. While it doesn't have sound (and this is where surviving cast members Meriwether, Darren and Colbert could have provided narration much like the ""Hogan's Heroes"" set did) it's a fascinating glimpse behind-the-scenes on the shooting of the pilot episode and series that's rare in TV shows released to DVD. I have to give Fox kudos for not just dumping this on the market much as Universal has done with their TV shows on DVD (and Sony at times as well). We also get promotional spots for both radio and TV as well as trailers. We also get some odd visual effects camera tests that survives from the show as well as a production still gallery, merchandise still gallery, comic book still gallery, and concept art gallery. Sadly There are no commentary tracks.

""The Time Tunnel"" is still a terrific series despite the fact that the visual effects and some of the storytelling elements haven't aged very well. Fox has done a great job of raiding their archives for vintage footage of the shooting of the show and other goodies. I hope that the second set will include a commentary or two and the pilot for the 2002 revival that wasn't picked up by any of the networks. Otherwise, the show looks and sounds terrific and will be worthwhile for fans of the show and Allen's TV output.",1138406400,45,4425,4.639030612244898
2432979,4,B000BOH8Z0,"I had watched this show in its original run but had mostly forgotten about it in the years since.

This set brings back a lot of memories. This show is fun to watch again even though the passing years now make it look quaint and simplistic.

I'll give 20th Century Fox Video credit for at least taking the time and effort to do a proper digital mastering of this show from the original elements. The transfer is crisp, sharp, and colorful the way these episodes actually looked when first aired using 35mm prints (had televisions back then worked as well as they do today, of course!).

But be warned, if you buy this set and have the Lost In Space DVD sets, you'll come to realize how BADLY the Lost In Space mastering and transfers were done. And how good they COULD have looked had the effort been made to do those transfers the way ""Time Tunnel"" was done.

I can only hope that the mastering and transfer work done on the upcoming ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" DVD's will match the ""Time Tunnel"" efforts.",1138320000,12,1012,4.39572192513369
2432980,4,B000BOH8Z0,I absolutely enjoyed this dvd set.  The show hasn't been televised much since 1968 and now is the perfect way to view it!  This show was a landmark for scifi television in it's time period of the late 60's.  Excellent use of bright colors in it's filming and the transfer to dvd is crisp.  I never really got into other Irwin Allen shows as much as The Time Tunnel. I rank it among one of my favorite 60's tv shows along other great shows like The Prisoner and UFO.,1138320000,5,465,4.191011235955056
2432981,5,B000BOH8Z0,"I just finished watching disc 1, and must say I'm impressed.  This series is like a 'who's-who' of classic 1950's and 1960's sci-fi.  Every episode is a treat, and the guest appearances bring back many fond memories of other sci-fi gems, such as 'Forbidden Planet' and 'The Day The Earth Stood Still'.

Sure, the special effects may be somewhat crude by today's standards, but remember what the state of the art was back in 1966.  Given the limited budget and technology available, this was an exemplary effort.

A MUST have for anyone that truly appreciates classic science fiction.",1138147200,14,583,4.908163265306122
2432982,3,B000BOH8Z0,"Growing up in the 60's, I watched the Time Tunnel and most other action/sci-fi television. Usually on a black & white set. While the Time Tunnel has been re-running on Encore Action the past several years, I've anticipated the release of the first episodes on DVD because of the bonus features, and the film transfer that was to go back to the original prints.

The content is wonderful. The Irwin Allen home movies of the pilot episode production are fun to watch (the actors are smoking while rehersing in the desert and at the Tunnel controls).

The transfer has to be the best television ""Film-to-DVD"" treatment from that era of television that I've ever seen. The colors of the equipment and scale models that make up Project Tic-Toc are astonishing. The televised broadcast could never delivered this level of detail.

All was fine until the end of the pilot episode when the image began to pixilize and playback stopped. Here we are again with Fox taking a crumpled page out of the Universal Studios book of how to market television on optical media.

Most of the Universal titles, Adam-12, Dragnet, etc. are widely known to have DVD read errors. I found this out after having to return multiple sets of both to local retailers. Fox's ""Lost in Space"" seemed fine having four episodes to a single sided dual layered DVD. The Time Tunnel is produced on two double sided DVD's and that must simply be a recipe for disaster.

Keep your receipts, for unlike Tony and Doug, you can't travel back to the time just before the purchase and change your mind.",1138147200,26,1555,4.702205882352941

2432984,4,B000BOH8Z0,"Like one of the other reviewers here, I, too, was about 12 when Time Tunnel was on prime time and made it a Friday night ritual. The local public television station ran it a few years ago, and I was able to see it with new, older eyes. While I have every intention of buying both seasons of the show, be aware that in the last 15 minutes of each episode, there will probably be a fight (fists or swords, depending on the era Doug and Tony are in), whether or not it seems logical or not. The fights seem to have been inserted to create drama and conflict, and they were never particularly well staged.

When the second season DVDs come out, remember that there was a specific attempt to become more of a ""sci-fi"" show that there was in the first season (which was more science fantasy), so you'll see more stories with alien visitors and UFO folderol. Again, I'll buy that set too, but there is a market difference between the show's two seasons. Apparently neither worked, since if memory serves, it went off the air after that.

When I was 11, time couldn't pass fast enough each week till Friday night rolled around and I could escape the daily grind for a bit of fun with Tony and Doug.  Sure, I had the required crush on James Darren (still do), but it was Robert Colbert who truly captured my heart (still does).  Sure, looking back the sets were tacky, the effects were cheesy, but the adventure was fun and exciting.  It even helped some of us kids learn a touch of history.  I recall my sister having a history test, but she did not study.  However, the time period visited on the show that week gave her enough historial information to pass her test on Monday!  The younger generation may not appreciate the show, but there are plenty of us old-timers who still do.  I plan on sharing the adventures with my own four children.  One question -- when is Volume II coming out?...It's now two weeks later,  I am now the proud owner of Volume I.  The show held up much better than I anticipated!  What is a shock for me -- is the color!  When I watched the show back in 1966, my family only had a black-and-white TV set. It is so great seeing Doug and Tony's adventures ""in living color."" There are so many memories wrapped up in that little DVD box that just mean so much to me.  Now I'm passing on the torch -- my 13-year-old son is enthralled.  He's watching the shows in order.

I saw an old, cheesy, severely dated show frought with cold-war hysteria, a relic from a time when might made right, when minorities were rarely allowed on the tube. Why, the ""futuristic"" episode I veiwed was down-right hysterical, but for all the wrong reasons.  So far as I am now concerned, my memory suffers from a deceided lack of credibility.
