1. poor video taping - sub-par amateur quality.

2. price relative to the poor quality of the DvD which even blacks out in the middle of the viewing for a few seconds.

but fujiwara is great. while his English is poor but he made it up with continuous techniques demonstrating; he did not hold back any. he is also a very funny guy so in spite of the poor quality of the taping, he kept it very entertaining. no one will get bore with a teacher liked fujiwara.

dick is the opposite. he wore a whistle on his neck, he is a classic high school typed wrestling coach yet he is very approachable. while he claimed that he lost his agility due to his senior age, but i truly believe he can choke any grown men out if he wishes. he taught a few old classic catch wrestling techniques

Awesome teaching from both !",1180051200,2,833,4.18125
