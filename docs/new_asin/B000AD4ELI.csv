2385088,4,B000AD4ELI,"Love & Human Remains is a thriller that will keep you guessing.

Going to a film festival can be daunting when you look at a schedule with too many choices. A rule that my friends and I used at the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival was that if it comes from Canada, it will be good. Love & Human Remains should make Canadian film makers proud.",1360108800,3,356,4.313432835820896
2385089,3,B000AD4ELI,"To let other buyers beware, this DVD is NOT a region 1 DVD. Love and Human Remains has never been released on Region 1 DVD. This WILL play on an all region DVD player.",1357776000,,167,3.9411764705882355
2385090,5,B000AD4ELI,"This movie is so interesting.  The Mystery is going on in the background of the movie, touching each character but you don't realize it til it's right in front of you.  It's done so well",1347148800,,186,4.285714285714286
2385091,1,B000AD4ELI,"I was very excited to be purchasing ""Love and Human Remains""- it is a video that I loved when I first saw it. Unfortunately, the dvd does not play. It isn't scratched, cracked, or damaged in any way that I can see with the naked eye. It just does not play. Bummer.",1345420800,,264,4.096153846153846
2385092,3,B000AD4ELI,"An interesting multi-layered film focusing on the private lives of promiscuous urban city dwellers. Sexual curiosities yield erotic investigation for one gay man room-mating with a bi-curious gal, both of whom are friends with a dominatrix, whose social circle is haunted by a serial killer in their midst, unbeknownst to them, until finally revealed in the end, who also suffers an unexpected fate.

In one remarkable and disturbing scene, he takes a ""job"" with her, in which he plays the part of a 'white knight' type of 'good' cowboy dressed in white, rescuing the girl in apparent distress, while the client plays the role of the villain cowboy reminiscent of a spaghetti western, who is thereby admonished to quite literally lick the boots of the 'good' cowboy, to his disgust and dismay.

Another scenario relates the burgeoning sexuality of a young man who harbors a crush on him, pursuing his curiosity until finally submitting to a request that he pull down his pants, bend over a pool table, leaving him in a vulnerable, potentially humiliating position, but which only seems to prod him further with his curiosities.  Remembering the previous evening's travails through a miasma of distorted recollection, he inquires as to who it was that  brought him to climax the previous night, wherein he was given a dose of heroin, promptly delivering him into an unconscious stupor.

In the end, all are embroiled in a mishmash of dependency upon a serial killer who turns out to be someone unexpected, who proclaimed his love while plunging backwards to his death.

A fascinating plot throughout, eventually revealing one of the characters contracting the dreaded HIV virus.

Overall, the film displays a circle of acquaintances who partook in rather compulsive behavior, demonstrating the cause & effect results of irresponsibility & compulsion. Partake in the pleasures of the flesh as you will, but just remember that the key to responsible indulgence is the application of epicurean selection. '",1327881600,2,2002,5.141538461538461
2385093,5,B000AD4ELI,The only thing I really love the most in this movie is beautiful asian woman Christy Chung plays a gum chewing prostitute she doesn't speak non but that's ok. The action is good in this film too.,1134086400,2,195,4.297297297297297
2385094,5,B000AD4ELI,"first saw it in boston a decade ago, plus, saw the stage play off bway. still a fave.

wonderful twists, great acting, lots of little side-dramas. wonderfully goofy situs juxtaposed w/ awkward, scary and funny. ending a bit too tidy, but the route there is entertaining. and, one of my fave lines of all time: david, on arriving in his humble abode, shared w/ candy (yum): ""honey, i'm homo!""

warning: skin-on-skin is not just hetero, for those who are sensitive to that sort of thing.

don't know about this format, but fortunately bro got me player that will play it. am ordering. glad i didn't have to order it from australia.",1123113600,7,629,4.648648648648648
2385095,3,B000AD4ELI,"Unfortunately, nothing too profound in this movie of alienation and randy encounters. Characters are mildly intriguing to watch as they wander somewhat aimlessly through their lives. Story projects these people as alienated from one another, themselves, their jobs, ""normal""  life. . . everything. Gibson is a talented beauty, likeable, you want him  to find whatever it is he's looking for, but you'll grow frustrated by his  directionlessness. From whence does it stem? His long-time buddy is  gorgeous, suited or unsuited (was that his nice naked rear that flashed  away all too quickly? MORE PLEASE.), but the lost soul he plays is even  harder to appreciate because, again, there's no compelling reason for him  to be the way he is. Meaning and love don't ever just come handed to you on  a plate, foks, but that's what the characters in this movie seem to expect.  And not having found them, they do (fill in the blank)  stupid/dangerous/contradictory/psychotic things that don't bring them any  closer to meaning or love. This moderately sexually charged movie is a good  one to use to contemplate life alone or with a loved one, but life  shouldn't be, AND ISN'T, as answerless and arbitrary as all this.",949276800,8,1212,5.0

8077853,5,B000AD4ELI,"I will admit that I ordered this just for Thomas Gibson, and he did not fail me. He was great in this role. The serial killer was underplayed (which I was pleased with), meaning the whole movie did not focus on the killing. The differences between each of his friends were realistic and drew you in. The psychic/dominatrix girl was a little bit out there and unbelievable, but her part was a small one.
Thomas Gibson was great as a gay man refusing to grow up and to love, even though deep down he does love all of his friends for what each one brought to his life. I am surprised that this movie did not get more attention, and Gibson has yet again demonstrated his ability to fill any role believably.",1438905600,3,703,4.333333333333333

8077859,5,B000AD4ELI,"Based on his stage play, this is the story of a man and a woman, roommates, looking for love and missing it every time while the twisted and deranged search for the same thing forces their friend to really extreme actions. Compelling and uneasy, this film is a small gem.",1378252800,,271,4.44
8077860,4,B000AD4ELI,"Fine film. stars Thomas Gibson, most familiar to me from his
appearances on ""Tales of the City"". The other actors I don't know
but to me all excellent. The DVD claims uncut edition, but unless
I'm missing something it's the same running time as the VHS.  No
complaints here, just glad to have on DVD,",1373414400,,300,4.454545454545454
