8329299,1,B001O4C6SA,"The film is an adequate ""B"" movie from the late 30's, and a decent (not full on restored) print would be worth the price, given that it is a bit of a rarity. The problem is, the Alpha print is unacceptably bad. I have a number of Alpha DVDs, and they range from appalling to mediocre. This is appalling. I accept that level of quality for early silents, because usually there is no other source for them. But in this case, there are free public domain copies available that are no worse than this DVD. I had thought (or at least hoped) the Alpha print would be a bit better. It wasn't. I'm not complaining that it isn't restored, I get that that isn't practical. But this is blurry to the point that some of the print in the titles is unreadable, and overly contrasted as well. I wouldn't recommend buying this, instead find the free public domain copy. This looks like that one, just burned on a DVD.",1394236800,,901,4.337278106508876
8329300,3,B001O4C6SA,"CIRCUS GIRL (Republic Pictures, 1937) is a fun way to spend a spare hour.  The story is tight and compact, with a good balance between conventional circus drama and psychological thriller.  The screenplay was co-authored by Bradford Ropes, who penned the original ""42nd Street"".  Just like in that landmark musical, a dark heart lies at the centre of this glittery big-top...

At Roeblings Circus, the star attractions are trapeze artists The Flying Devils: Charles (Donald Cook) and Bob (Robert Livingston).  Tensions between the two men start to mount when Charlie secretly marries promising young aerial performer Kay Rogers (June Travis)--whom Bob harbours a secret crush for--even though Charlie is still carrying on a long-time affair with lion tamer Carlotta (Betty Compson).  When Charlie is seriously injured during their act, and learns of Bob's feelings for Kay, he decides to kill him....

Alpha's DVD comes from a very ropey video print.  A pristine nitrate negative of this title is said to exist in the UCLA archives; although I doubt we'll ever see it surface on DVD.  This is a very minor film though it's hugely enjoyable when approached in the right spirit.
