8123061,4,B000FII2QQ,"Rembrant is my favorite artist, so I like most anything about him.  This documentary had a lot of interesting information from his personal life, which for me always provides a greater depth to the art.  It is always interesting to see just how ""human"" a famous person was, to know about their flaws and addictions gives us all hope I suppose?  Hopefully someday someone with remake this one in a little more lively format, as the information is presented in what I'd call a ""lecture"" format, which works fine if what you want is information.  But if you want a little entertainment (a little) this is not the type of film for that.  Overall I think it is well organized and a well made film, as it is always a challenged to present anyone entire life is one sitting.",1459209600,,767,4.489208633093525
8123062,5,B000FII2QQ,"Consistent with the format in this series by kultur on notable flemish and dutch artists, a narrator carries the burden of conveying information with brief comments by experts interspersed. This is a good introduction because it shows a decent sampling of paintings in good color. The commentary is rudimentary,  in keeping with the purposes of an introduction, the experts not necessarily more illuminating, but the overall impact should be to impress the viewer with some of the reasons why he or she should go out and look at some 'real' Rembrandts or, at least, read a monograph with plenty of
sound reproductions. More than that we cannot expect of a 50 minute period.",1293494400,,673,4.95575221238938
8123063,5,B000FII2QQ,"I have a small coffee and pastries shop on the beach in Mexico.  Always trying to enlighten wherever I go, I play these DVD's in the background for my clients in the dining room.  I have many in this series.  When the room is filled with Spanish speaking only clients, I turn down the sound and play classical music in the background.  When we have English speaking tourists, I use the informative soundtrack usually.  They are beautiful, informative & set an ambience for my slightly upscale clients.  I would recommend any in this series.  I have learned some things from them as well as has my son.",1243468800,2,601,4.5607476635514015
8123064,3,B000FII2QQ,"The video does a fine job of giving a biography of Rembrandt.  The analysis of his art is also admirable particularly the commentary by van Wetering.  However, there really is nothing new here and it is primarily an introduction to the topic.  If you are looking for something deeper you will need to search elsewhere.",1195603200,2,318,4.745454545454545
8123065,3,B000FII2QQ,"I learned a lot.  Rembrandt was his given name, not his family name.  Thus, he was like Napoleon or Madonna.  He was famous from the start, unlike the many artists who are not celebrated until they are long dead.  Like Thomas Jefferson, MC Hammer, and Josephine Baker, he went bankrupt.  That didn't involve art dealers exploiting him; he just lived beyond his means and had to pay for it.  The artist outlived his family and those who have lost children or spouses may relate to his tragedy.

This work interviewed men and women; English and Dutch.  I heard that the Netherlands pushes their citizens to learn foreign languages, so I should be surprised about their English fluency.

Sometimes the work leaves things out that I would have added.  The piece says Rembrandt sold many etchings.  They never mention how his etchings looked a lot like the drawings Da Vinci would produce.  The narrator said, ""Rembrandt was celebrated for painting groups, not just individuals.""  They then show a painting where a doctor is dissecting the arm of a corpse in front of other physicians,.  Some of the physicians are staring at the arm in question, but others are staring at the painter or looking in random directions.  I would think they'd all be staring at the same thing, so the painting looked unnatural, rather than extraordinary to me.

One interviewee is always filmed in profile.  Was an academic as vain as George Michael and demanded to only be filmed ""on his good side""?  A British interviewee had THICK, black eyebrows though his cranial hair was gray and receding.  Those must have been fake.  Why did this expert want to look like Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe on their ""Nightlife"" cover?!

Again, I learned about the Dutch maestro.  I think other viewers will benefit too.",1193529600,3,1779,4.801980198019802
8123066,3,B000FII2QQ,"While this was an informative DVD I found it a little dry. I like to show DVDs to my art history class, and this one did not capture their imagination as much as I would have liked.  A few two many talking heads.",1167868800,4,212,3.9302325581395348
