8151530,5,B000JK9YBM,"For any Aviation loving person this DVD is priceless. It covers a latitude of airplane
restoration and shows the folks who actually did the jobs. It goes all the way back
to to the Wright Brothers at Kittyhawk, North Carolina when aviation was in it's
infancy. This was a most enjoyable experience for me and I'm sure that it will be
the same for",1441065600,,346,4.421875

I will be giving this as a gift this season.",1384300800,2,133,4.076923076923077
8151533,5,B000JK9YBM,This film appears to be designed more as an advertisement to young people about how cool flying history can be so it's not very in depth.  But it profiles some of the great and unfortunately late restorers of WWII aircraft in a way that any audience should appreciate.  It definitely fosters the 'if I can do it so can you' spirit.,1357344000,2,331,4.409836065573771
8151534,4,B000JK9YBM,This is a really neat video. My boyfriend and I are both huge airplane nerds so this was right up our alley.  The video is nostalgic and is a neat story.  The only reason it only gets four stars is I wish it had a little more detail and went a little longer in length.,1241740800,10,268,3.8545454545454545
8151535,5,B000JK9YBM,"Very informative. As a pilot myself I have piloted some of those old air craft. In my younger years I rebuilt about 4 Stermans from the ground up and made crop dusters out of them. I would remove the old standard engine and replace it with a Prat & Whitney 450 Hp. Later I helped rebuild 3 Corvairs,also 1 F8F Bearcat. The Bearcat is one you do not warm up the engine with the canopy open or you will get covered in oil. I would recommend this movie to everyone,I enjoyed it very much.",1182902400,21,485,4.170212765957447
