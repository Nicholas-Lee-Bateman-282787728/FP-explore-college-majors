This message movie attempts to scare people by imagining a dying world that will be killed by invaders from outer space. Is the Earth being killed by too many people and greenhouse gas? No, even if these claims have been made for decades. There was global warming from 800AD to 1300AD, the Medieval Warming Period. It was followed by the Little Ice Age that lasted to 1850. Volcanoes affect the weather, so too an asteroid that strikes the earth. Watch the original 1951 movie for a better story. Immanuel Velikovsky wrote Worlds in Collision to explain past catastrophes upon earth; so too Earth in Upheaval.",1527724800,,2981,4.661596958174905
