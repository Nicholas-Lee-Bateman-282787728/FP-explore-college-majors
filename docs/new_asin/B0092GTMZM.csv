8534732,4,B0092GTMZM,"Auto mechanic and race car driver, Eddie Shannon, is groomed by a beautiful woman to be the driver for a bank heist. Mickey Rooney, famous for his musicals and comedies, plays a straight dramatic role to perfection in this film. Although slow moving in parts, there is plenty of drama, suspense and action to make this a worthy addition to the film noir genre. This taut film makes good viewing.",1488844800,,395,4.6571428571428575
