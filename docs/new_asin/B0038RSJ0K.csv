8391749,3,B0038RSJ0K,"This was supposed to be so special. This was supposed to be historical and memorable, and it was...but not in the greatest way when all was said and done in the very end. UFC 112 was in Abu Dhabi, a location known for grappling and submission championships, where the best of the best have gathered to show the skills they possess on the ground. And finally, the UFC made history by having its first outdoor event. And starring in the Main Event was Anderson Silva taking on Demian Maia. Anderson Silva has shown us the very best that striking has to offer. Yet at UFC 90 and UFC 97, he showed clowning around and piss-poor performances that merely allowed him to keep his Middleweight title. Patrick Cote came to bring it at UFC 90, and his knee gave out. Thales Leites came to bring it at UFC 97, and Silva acted like a jack-ass! But when Forrest Griffin came to fight at UFC 101, so did Anderson!! And we thought he was back. And here he is in UFC 112. Standing in his way would be Demian Maia, a submission extradordinaire! He's submitted a who's who of UFC vets. Ryan Jensen at UFC 77? DONE FOR! Ed Herman at UFC 83? Only took a round and a half. Jason MacDonald gave him a few things to think about at UFC 87 before finally tapping in the 3rd round. He made Chael Sonnen look like NOTHING at UFC 95. And after getting knocked out by Nate Marquardt at UFC 102 rather quickly, he came back at UFC 109 against Dan Miller and showed that he had enough stand-up to take a decision. Now he gets his chance. Is he going to pull off what every Middleweight contender has wanted to pull off since Anderson Silva entered the octagon?

The Co Main Event featured the legend in BJ Penn taking on Frankie Edgar for the Lightweight Championship. Penn has displayed his talents against the best out there, and he's been beaten by some of the best as well. All he has to do is take out this wrestler who knows how to strike to keep his title. That wrestler is Frankie, ""The Answer"" Edgar. He's only lost once in his career, and the decisions he's fought to in his career have all been unanimous decisions. And Edgar has come to this fight to win, that he makes quite clear in the gladiator introduction. Will that be the case? Or will Penn take it home once again with no problem?

Also featured is legend Renzo Gracie taken on Matt Hughes. Hughes dismantled Royce Gracie back at UFC 60. Will it still be that simple against his cousin?

I am a firm believer that one fight doesn't ruin an evening of entertainment for fans. But it can certainly put people in bad spirits when all is said and done. But, there was more than just one fight on this evening. There were 10 fights, they didn't ALL suck, and I'll list 'em below!

Jon Madsen vs. Mostapha al Turk: When UFC credentials come into play, Mostapha certainly has the bragging rights, and Kongo and Cro Cop made examples of him. When it comes to Jon Madsen, you wonder who might show up. The lay n' pray man from the TUF Heavyweight show, or the man who actually stood up with Justin Wren and took a split decision to stick around. You can't exactly call this fight a fan favorite, but it did stay interesting, and a unanimous decision was awarded in the end!

Paul Kelly vs. Matt Veach: These 2 guys are so tough, and incredibly scrappy! They've got a lot of fire under them, and one of them walks away with a 2nd round submission!

DaMarques Johnson vs. Brad Blackburn: These guys are both battlers, they bring it each time, and have had their ups and downs. This is a scrap that ends with a 3rd round TKO!

Nick Osipczak vs. Rick Story: Both of these guys can give an opponent a hard time. Osipczak comes into this undefeated, and Story's only lost to John Hathaway. This is a grueling battle that ends in a split decision! Not everybody was happy with who won.

Alexander Gustafsson vs. Phil Davis: A rangy wrestler with all kinds of talent takes on a man who brings some great skills and lethal hands. This is pretty slick with an awesome submission in the 1st!

Kendall Grove vs. Mark Munoz: These two are friends, and despite that, they beat the living crap out of each other! One of them walks away with a 2nd round TKO, but they both have a FIGHT OF THE NIGHT PERFORMANCE!!

Terry Etim vs. Raphael dos Anjos: I'll say instantly that Etim is one of my favorite fighters in the Lightweight division! And although he brings it, it took a few fights before dos Anjos was promoted to a Main Card. This was a great scrap, and I've got to give credit where credit is due as a beautiful submission was pulled off in the 2nd!

Matt Hughes vs. Renzo Gracie: In all honestly, I was hoping to see more action throughout this fight. But in the end, there was a 3rd round TKO! Nothing to be ashamed of, just could've been a little better.

BJ Penn vs. Frankie Edgar: What can you say? SURPRISE, SURPRISE!! A smart, well thought out scrap, and just look who came out on top in the end with a unanimous decision, and NEW Lightweight Champion!!

Anderson Silva vs. Demian Maia: When Dana White himself doesn't even bother to put the belt around you after your performance, you'd better be embarrassed! This was nothing impressive, and it certainly wasn't classy. Bruce Buffer could barely muster the enthusiasm needed to announced that this was a unanimous decision. What a shame!

As I said, one fight doesn't ruin everything. But this time, it did tick people off. When all was said and done, you can say that there were some fights worth watching again, yet some you'd soon rather forget.",1296432000,,5528,4.4068627450980395

INVINCIBLE

I was looking forward to this event so much since my favorite fighter BJ Penn was fighting and another favorite Renzo Gracie was making his UFC debut. This event turned out to be one of the craziest days in the history of the sport and you will read why down below.

DISC 1

1. KENDALL GROVE VS MARK MUNOZ-the first fight of the night on the televised card starts great, at least for Grove. He controls the first round and even drops Mark with a well timed uppercut, as well as going for choke after choke. The second round starts with Grove landing a vicious knee on Mark but still it was not meant to be as Mark turns it up. He comes from behind and starts landing hard shots on Grove and getting the TKO, this fight won fight of the night honors. 5/5

2. TERRY ETIM VS RAFAEL DOS ANJOS-very competitive first round between these two as it plays out mostly on the ground with one almost ending it. The second round is very technical and any one wanting to watch some good ground work needs to watch this round. Anjos works patiently on top for a while waiting for his moment and sinks in a nice arm bar, he also won submission of the night. 4/5

3. MATT HUGHES VS RENZO GRACIE-I was looking forward to this fight so much since I am the biggest Renzo Gracie fan and not really a fan of Hughes at all. Renzo is one of the all time greatest and holds a choke out victory over the man that trained Hughes, Pat Miletich. Renzo was making his UFC debut here becoming only the third Gracie to fight for the organization, that is something since the Gracies started the UFC. The first round is really good and is more of a feeling out round with both doing well, Renzo landing the better strikes and combos. Hughes lands some good leg kicks in the first round but I still feel Gracie took the close round with his strikes, body kick, and stuffing Hughes's take down attempts. The second round is a little more aggressive with both landing some good strikes and both landing some kicks, but it is Hughes that lands the harder leg kicks. The round is close but Hughes finishes stronger so I think he took it. The third round is all Hughes as his leg kicks just take their toll on Renzo, he ends the round with a TKO victory over one of the best ever. Now I am no fan of Hughes but he unleashed a great game plan and was very respectful after the win.

Now the thing I did not like was Dana White talking his trash after the fight, he said Renzo looked old in the fight [Renzo is actually 40 so]. The truth is Renzo looked great in the first good in the second and tired in the third. I would call that ring [or cage] rust like Dana likes to say for other fighters that come in. He said Tito lost the Forrest rematch because of ring rust and has said the same for Chuck and others. The truth is that was ring rust, Renzo is a legend and deserves respect.

4. BJ PENN VS FRANKIE EDGAR-the other fight I was looking forward to a lot because BJ Penn is my favorite fighter of all time. In this fight he defended his Lightweight title against a huge underdog in Edgar. Now there is something I must point out, during the fighter walk outs Penn looked off and was leaning on his corner men. When he made it to the cage and you got a full view of him he was wearing a knee brace. Now this fight is literally one that you must watch and analyze, watch in slow more and such.

The entire fight and each round is very close starting of course with the first, in which Edgar moves around the out side a lot. Edgar lands a few leg kicks and a few punches, but it is BJ that lands more so and lands with combinations. In every round if you really watch it Edgar misses more than he lands, I got BJ winning a close round one. The second round is another close one but it more obvious in this round that BJ is landing more than Edgar, but Edgar does get a take down. With that said BJ literally touches the ground and is right back up, so with that I still feel BJ won the round. It is here in the third round that things got super close, so close in fact that I could not call a winner. That round was a toss up but to Edgar's credit he mixed it up well. The fourth round is once again close but it is a little more obvious that BJ landed more shots, Edgar once again moved well but Penn landed more so BJ takes the round. The final round is another close one but Edgar did a great job of out maneuvering Penn in the final round. Now depending on how you scored the fight you may or may not agree with me but I had BJ winning this fight. The judges that night disagreed and we have a new Lightweight champion. 5/5

Now regardless of whom I thought or who you thought won that fight the truth is it was an excellent fight. Both fighters went out there and put on a great stand up battle for all of us, and regardless of me feeling that BJ won that fight hats off to Edgar. He is a good fighter that is always improving and he showed all kinds of respect to Penn after the fight. Now back to what I said earlier Penn seemed to have been injured going into this fight with the knee brace and not looking like his self at 155. I bring this up not as an excuse for him loosing but as what I think the reasoning is behind him getting an immediate rematch. People have been wondering and I think that is the reason, he was injured going in but still fought since he was advertised as doing so. So I think Dana and them knowing this gave him the time to heal and gave him the rematch.

5. ANDERSON SILVA VS DEMIAN MAIA-the main event was for the UFC Middleweight championship with champ Silva putting it on the line against BJJ master Maia. The first round is apart of the Anderson Silva show as he dominates the fight with some amazing stand up work but he shows off a lot and doesn't finish the fight in the round. The second round is a continence of said show with Silva showing off and winning the round easily. The third round is the final act of the show for Silva but is not the final round, Silva wins the round. The forth round sees Anderson tired from all the showboating and basically runs around the outside the whole time. The final round sees Maia going for broke and actually catching Silva a few times but Silva keeps running. In fact he runs so much that the ref gets on to him about it, the best part of the fight is when Maia is swinging from his knees trying to beat Silva. Of course Silva retains the title by unanimous D but man was that a crazy fight. Regardless of how you feel it was still an entertaining fight, the first half thanks to Silva and the last to Maia. 3.5/5

Disc one has the post fight presser and the promos for the event on it as well.

DISC 2

1. JON MADSEN VS MOSTAPHA AL TURK-I am a fan of Al Turk and have only rooted against him when he fought the great Mirko Cro Cop so I was rooting for him here. The first round has some good action with Jon landing some good shots on Turk, but towards the end of the round Turk was finding a home for the leg kick. The second round is a little better for Turk but both land some good shots. The final round is basically Madsen winning the stand up game and securing a take down at the end of the round. He earns the UD win an Al Turk ended up getting cut from the UFC after this fight. 3.8/5

2. PAUL KELLY VS MATT VEACH-the first round of this fight is great with Veach controlling the first half raking him down and even getting his back. But Kelly makes his way to the top and closes out the round with some nice shots. Another great round with both going for broke but Kelly gets full mount and sinks in the guillotine for the win. 4.5/5

3. DAMARQUES JOHNSON VS BRAD BLACKBURN-another good fight right here with both fighters swinging to end it all, both do very well in the stand up but I think Johnson lands the most. The second round is full of action with both guys once again swinging to win, but Brad wins the round with two take downs. The third round is just as exciting with Brad getting on top but Johnson sweeps him and ends up on top. Once back on the feet Johnson ends the fight by TKO.5/5

4. NICK OSIPCZAK VS RICK STORY-Story dominates the first round easily getting on top and dropping some powerful bombs. The second round is a little more even as Nick keeps things on the feet for the most part. The third round is even more competitive making the fight not only go to the judges but to a split decision win for Story. 4/5

5. ALEXANDER GUSTAFSSON VS PHIL DAVIS-this fight does not make it out of the first round but it gets close. The fight is good with both defending well but Davis is more aggressive and works the entire round. Then with less than ten seconds left to go Davis sinks in an Anaconda choke and gets the win. 5/5

Disc two has the countdown show, the behind the scenes, and the .com features on it. All in all this turned out to be a crazy day for the sport as well you read it up above. I still can't believe this event actually happened the way it did.",1277856000,5,8969,4.1242129364625075
8391752,3,B0038RSJ0K,"112 was the first event held outdoors.  In fact, a stadium was constructed for the sole purpose of hosting UFC events.  A few months before this event took place, the UFC sold a minority portion of the company to Flash Entertainment, a live events company based out of United Arab Emirates with the hopes that they will help the UFC further expand globally.

112 was held in Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.  It was an event that was supposed to showcase the UFC talent for it's new investors in the Middle East.  First impressions upon watching this event is that the crowd is not your typical ""UFC crowd"".  The front section by the Octagon was filled with Saudi royalty.  The venue that was constructed looked top notch and no detail was spared.

This event featured 3 main events.

Anderson Silva who is the UFC middleweight champion and hands down the best pound for pound fighter in the world faced off against jiu jitsu ace Demian Maia.  Silva was originally supposed to face Vitor Belfort but due to an injury Belfort suffered, Maia stepped up for the title shot.  Silva's striking is second to none.  He has pin point accuracy with his punches and devistating knees.  Even though he holds a black belt in BJJ, he is not on the same jiu jitsu level as Maia.  If Silva has any weakness it is his ground game so most people were expecting Anderson to avoid going to the ground at all costs.  This fight received a lot of media attention afterwards.  See why UFC president Dana White left the arena before the fight ended for the first time ever.

Next, in a lightweight championship bout, UFC lightweight champion BJ Penn steps in the cage to face rising contender Frankie Edgar.  Just like the Anderson Silva fight, the champ, BJ Penn was a heavy favorite going in to this fight.  BJ, after losing to George St Pierre at welterweight, dropped back down to lightweight, his true weight class and went on a tear.  He took out Kenny Florian and Diego Sanchez and truly seemed unbeatable at lightweight.  Frankie Edgar thinks otherwise.  Edgar was riding a 3 fight win streak against some notable lightweight competition going into this bout.  Edgar's has amazing boxing and very respectable wrestling.  BJ has phenomenal Jiu Jitsu and is next to impossible to take to the ground.  Can he pull off what would be one of the biggest upsets in UFC history???

The third featured bout was between Matt Hughes and Renzo Gracie.  Hughes is coming of a close decision win against arch rival Matt Serra.  Although some people consider Hughes to be past his prime, he is still able to use his superior strength and wrestling ability to his advantage.  The Gracie family are the creators of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Renzo has instructed various Sheikh's in the Middle East.  He was treated like royalty at this event and clearly got the loudest applause when he entered the cage.  But Renzo was also personally motivated to fight Hughes who beat his cousin and original UFC winner, Royce Gracie.  Can he defeat a bigger, stronger Hughes and bring back the Gracie to the list of the UFC's best?

The rest of the main card was:

Terry Etim vs Rafael Dos Anjos
Kendall Grove vs Mark Munoz

Prelims:

Alexandor Gustafsson vs Phil Davis
Nick Osipczak vs Rick Story
DaMarques Johnson vs Brad Blackburn
Paul Kelly vs Matt Veach
Jon Madsen vs Mostapha Al Turk

The card as a whole was pretty decent, with many submissions and ko's.  But this was also one of the most contraversial cards in some time.  Not the best dvd for first time casual fans to get introduced to the UFC.  It's a must have for the hardcore fan to complete the collection.",1272326400,6,3615,4.621069182389937
