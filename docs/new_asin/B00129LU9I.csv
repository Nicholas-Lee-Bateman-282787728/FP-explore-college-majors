8326018,5,B00129LU9I,"i remember watching this as a teenager and me and my family loved it. I wish it was available on DVD. Honestly if the seller wasn't totally price gouging us at $115. for the VHS tape version of this, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Luckily, somebody awesome put all the videos on You Tube. They aren't the highest quality picture, but you can enjoy the songs, at least, without paying such an outrageous price for the VHS tape.",1479600000,,426,4.3375
8326019,5,B00129LU9I,"My daughter remembered this video when she was young and wanted her children to enjoy it as well now that she has 5 girls.  She has asked me many times if I could find our copy of the tape, but I know it went by the wayside long ago, when I found it on Amazon, I sent it to her for her birthday.  What a surprise, she was so excited.  But she had to borrow a VCR from a neighbor to watch it.  Too bad it doesn't come in DVD or does it?",1346457600,,435,3.6451612903225805
8326020,5,B00129LU9I,I sure wish this was on DVD too.  I have the VHS which is worn out....perhaps I should just bite the bullett and purchase another copy of the VHS.  What an awesome movie.....a hightlight of my life raising young children who watched this video over and over again.,1280448000,,264,4.479166666666667
8326021,5,B00129LU9I,"I also remember this movie from my childhood, when a friend of mine would bring it over on Sundays to watch together.  10 years later I was called to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I asked my friend if she still had the movie.  She dug it out and ended up giving it to me as a gift right before I left for Germany!  I watched it then and remembered almost all of the words :)  I sang the songs for my companions as we walked to appointments.  Now I am home, and I watch this film at least once a month because I LOVE it so much.  It has such a great message and resonates even more for me, now that I have seen missionary work in action.  Now I just want it on DVD...",1262390400,2,709,3.8819444444444446
8326022,5,B00129LU9I,"I remember going to the Westwood movie theatre, in Rexburg, IDAHO, when The movie first came out.
I had an affinity for Missionary work, and wanted to be of service to GOD. I saw the film 4 times in one day, at that time!
I wanted to tell everyone about Mormonism, and how they can, and could return to Heavenly Father, by helping their neighbors.
WOW! WHAT A WAKE-UP CALL, NOW!
I love GOD, But am an excommunicant, of the LDS faith, because of SEX, DRUGS (alcohol), and ROCK-AND-ROLL!",1248739200,,485,4.46067415730337
