4532662,1,B0052XU4BK,"I'm no huge fan of the ""Children Of The Corn"" series to begin with,although the first of the series has some appeal as it's at least based on Stephen King's story.  I guess I just watched this because I was bored, but I was even more bored after I was done.  This is a rather aimless and pointless sequel that just goes nowhere & stays there.  A young couple stranded after their car breaks down in the desert take refuge with a weird couple that have a child locked up in the shed out back, and that child appears to have some kind of powers.  The man who owns the house turns out to be a refugee from Gatlinburg, Nebraska, & he is shown at the beginning of the film as a young man returning home (from Vietman) to a house empty of living adults but there are plenty of murderous children hanging around.  Fast forward to the present and he's a whacko living in the desert with a mail-order Ukranian bride and one of those evil kiddies living in the shed.  The young woman that comes with her hubby seeking refuge is of course, pregnant, and he/they want her.  For what, I don't know, hopefully not for any more sequels.  The film makes little sense, and is truly not a good use of your time.  One of the least interesting films I've seen in a while.",1315180800,8,1251,4.244725738396625
4532663,3,B0052XU4BK,"From the title I thought this was going to be a prequel, but I quickly figured out ""Genesis"" refers to the book of Genesis and perhaps a play on the word for the beginning of evil. The movie opens in 1973 with a returning soldier from Vietnam. He comes home to an eerie setting, one we would expect from the series.

The movie then jumps to present day as a couple (she is pregnant) are stranded in the desert far from civilization. They seek shelter at a farm run by a strange overly religious man (Billy Drago) and his mail order bride (Barbara Nedeljakova) who seems to want out. They spend the night with it being Sunday and options are few. They are warned NOT to go snooping around. Soon aforesaid pregnant wife (Kelen Coleman) is out at night looking around in the barn which looks like a ""Children of the Corn"" barn. She also discovers a child whimpering behind a locked door...hubby (Tim Rock) must do something, but the corn has other ideas.

I didn't think the ending was as good as the rest of the film. The movie doesn't have a whole bunch of kids running a community and killing adults as we have become used to. The title utilizes aspects of the series to set up for a squeal.

4532677,1,B0052XU4BK,"I want to punch this movie in the face. I've now watched all 9 (9???????) ""Children of the Corn"" movies, and I have to say that any good will I had toward this series after the original and first three sequels is long gone.

The storyline seems oddly close to ""Manos: Hands of Fate"". In the California desert a young couple's car breaks down and they seek refuge at a dilapidated farm house. Once inside they find an odd man and his mail order Russian wife. At this point they are held hostage by the odd couple who have a kid locked up in the shed out back. That's it....the whole thing is them trying to escape from the house. You may be asking yourself ""Where are the children?"" Or ""Where is the corn?""...the simple answer is...don't bother. There is,no connection between this story and King's tale.

Horrible movie, that has nothing to offer but annoyance. Avoid this one like a disease.",1403222400,2,892,4.5

4532684,4,B0052XU4BK,"There is a lot this film doesn't have. It doesn't have never ending fields of corn, it doesn't have hordes of pagan cult children that yield arsenals of sharp farming tools stained with blood, it doesn't have death after death that splatters blood on the camera. What it does have is a very refreshing, well made, unique entry into the children of the corn series.

First off you have your typical traveling couple that thinks they know everything stranded somewhere in California and the closest house is the home of ""Preacher"" (manson probably took some pointers from this guy.) He is reluctant to help them until he learns the girl is pregnant, guess what hes interested in.

Second off, with the exception of the prequel scene in the beginning, there are no children throughout the majority of the movie save the chosen one who leaves bloody footprints and handprints wherever he goes and is locked up in the shed outback. Its a creepy scene and the kid who played the chosen one never spoke but could send shivers down anyone's spine. You don't even get a good look at his face until the last scene, which is also the only time any other children show up. (and the most disappointing part of the whole movie.)

It doesn't delivers scares and a gore as much as it delivers creepy atmosphere and a whats going to happen next feeling. While with revelations I felt was a good end to the children of the corn series, I would enjoy a continuation of this storyline to see how this cult would work in modern times.",1367712000,4,1513,4.575645756457565

The eighth film, like several of the other sequels, doesn't take place in Gatlin, and is very loosely tied to the original story. I give this movie credit for possibly being the creepiest children of the corn, and for doing it without much of the gore the other films featured. A lot of the credit goes to veteran movie actor, Billy Drago, who is just creepy by nature. There is no denying the film is creepy, but is it good? No, not really! The story is very slow at times, inconsistent, and some what predictable. Genesis had a bit more potential than some of its predecessors, but in the end, despite the creepy vibe it gives off, it's just another really bad sequel that we didn't need",1364169600,,817,4.489932885906041

4532690,2,B0052XU4BK,"Tim and Allie are taken in by a crazed preacher and his wife after their car breaks down in the desert, but the dark forces at work on this remote farm refuse to let them leave! The eighth film in the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series is a bit of a mystery, especially considering the complete lack of both children and corn. GENESIS could have been filmed under any other name and remained just as ineffective. Billy Drago is creepy enough in his own right as Preacher, but he can never take the place of the murderous Gatlin children that are only alluded to in the plot. The opening act sets up an intriguing rebirth for the series that only becomes increasingly more convoluted and confused as the film goes on, until things finally fall apart in the end. Like HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS, CHILDREN OF THE CORN: GENESIS is a failed attempt to revitalize the series, and it ranks amongst the worst of the many sequels.

4532694,1,B0052XU4BK,"An utterly stupid story that made no sense whatsoever, there is absolutely nothing to appreciate in this latest installment of a franchise that needs to be put down like the sick farm animal that it has become.  Watching this makes one long for the gonzo days of 80s corn-horror when you got to see someone get impaled by a cornstalk-through the windshield of their car!  I tells you, they don't build cornfields like they used to.  Now, these days, we trade down to a corn shack peopled by Billy Drago who, when he's not slurring his lines that you can actually understand, plays a character that is almost unintentionally ambiguous, reptilian and creepy.  An so, probably like the children of the previous movies who inexplicably weren't in this movie to justify the title, you too will be left with no other option, but to scratch your head and ask what the hell.",1345852800,4,866,4.677631578947368
4532695,1,B0052XU4BK,"This film is abysmal. I was rooting for both protagonists (if you can call them that) to die 30 minutes in. As horror movie fans, we should feel offended that this drivel was even produced. I can't even imagine how Stephen King feels having his name in the opening credits (even if it's just to say the film is based on his ideas). The pregnant woman is not believable in her role and is so profoundly stupid the scariest part of the movie is thinking that she is procreating and keeping her gene pool going.  Scenes play out in illogical and stupid ways. For example in one particular scene, the pregnant woman is violently thrown against a wall and then trapped in a creepy house by an evil, supernatural force. Upon recovering, her reaction isn't fear or shock that she just experienced a supernatural force and saw proof of an evil power bent on her destruction; she doesn't want to discuss escape or question what's happening...no, instead she wants to scream at her boyfriend/husband about a rumor of infidelity. Unrealistic considering the circumstances. In another scene the woman's boyfriend asks her ""Did you see them drug our coffee or give us hallucienegetics!?"". What kind of question is that?? Is she going to respond ""Yes, I saw them pouring drugs into our iced tea when we got here but I didn't think that it was important enough to mention."". In the film's climax the man is speeding down the highway while cars are falling off of one of those 18- wheelers that transport automobiles. He swerves the first one, then another, and rather than pull over like anyone who is not completely retarded would, he tries to re-enact Grand Theft Auto and continues to speed down the highway swerving like a maniac until he crashes. The girl is then abducted by a ""town crazy"" in the middle of the busy highway in broad daylight. Does she scream?  Does she cry out for help?  Fight against him?  No, she sobs softly. That's it.

This movie is absolute garbage. Also of note there really aren't any ""Children of the Corn"" in it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this idiotic drivel.",1338076800,5,2082,4.646739130434782
4532696,5,B0052XU4BK,Compared to some of the other sequels this movie was great. This one is kind of a refreshing take on the Children of the corn movies. It also has a nice little twist at the end. Not a blockbuster but definitely worth a watch...or two!,1336521600,3,234,4.222222222222222
4532697,2,B0052XU4BK,"A young married couple Tim (Tim Rock) and Allie (Kelen Coleman), whose car has broken down in the middle of nowhere, end up staying for a night at house of a mysterious man `Preacher' (Billy Drago) living with his Ukrainian wife Helen (Barbara Nedeljakova). At night the two uninvited guests begin to suspect that there is someone - a child maybe - in the barn. Then some supernatural things start to happen. But are Tim and Allie seeing what they see?

It seems ""Children of the Corn: Genesis"" had to be made very quickly. The story of the low-budget film doesn't make much sense. The actors sleepwalk through their parts. The film is not very scary, but that is not the worst part of it. It is, in short, that no one who is involved in making the film seems to really care.

Except the brief opening chapter, in which Billy Drago's character, a young solider returning from Vietnam, witnesses something horrible, the film's disjointed story has little to no relation to what happened in Gatlin, Nebraska. Set in present-day California, the story of ""Children of the Corn: Genesis"" is almost pointless as a sequel or first chapter of a possible new series.",1334016000,5,1157,4.694581280788177
4532698,3,B0052XU4BK,"Oh Lord, here we go again!  Here's the ninth(if you count the remake of the first film) installment of a film series none of us wanted or asked for-The Children of the Corn series!!
But don't get me wrong, I love the first movie, though it's never been looked upon as being a great horror film.  The first film really expanded upon a very short story by Stephen King(who never considered it one of his better stories anyway), and the sequels still milk that whole ""Based on a story by Stephen King"" thing even though there is doodleysquat left of King's idea.
Genesis separates itself even further from pack, angering fans of the series, some of which dub the movie the ""Halloween 3"" of the series.  Well, I happen to like Halloween 3, even more so that any Halloween sequel after it, so I figured I'd give this a fair shake.  Plus, Billy Drago stars in this film, and I love the guy.  I was lucky enough to spend some time and smoke a few cigs with Drago, and found him to be extremely friendly.  So I guess I felt a bit honor bound as well.
Genesis follows Tim and Allie, a married(and pregnant) couple stranded in the California desert.  They seek refuge at a small farm with a preacher(Drago) and his wife.  Tim and Allie find they are an odd couple, with Drago being his creepy self, and his wife pulling a Sharon Stone spread for Tim on the kitchen table.  Still, Tim and Allie must stay the night, and get a ride into town in the morning.  Soon they find out that the odd couple are keeping an evil, telekinetic boy out in a shack.  The boy doesn't want the new guests to leave and terrorizes everybody Poltergeist-style.
Good God, will anyone survive this night of terror???
I agree, this film didn't need to be a Children of the Corn sequel necessarily.  Take away the prologue and a few references, it could have been it's own thing.  Now, on it's own I think it wasn't all that bad.  A bit cliched perhaps, but it was a nice slow burn of a suspense story, and was a helluva lot better than the pitiful last couple of sequels.  Plus, it's probably the most atmospheric of all the films, minus the first one of course.  The movie more than likely angered people because it didn't follow the structure of the previous films which consisted of strangers trotting into Gatlin, Nebraska and having to deal with a murderous child cult that worships ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"".
No, this film doesn't take place in the cornfields of Nebraska, but in the cornfieldless deserts of California.  ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" is referred to, but absent from all the action-probably because there are no rows to walk behind.  No child cult either, just the creepy, evil child in the shack.
So, how does it tie in?
Well, Drago came back from Vietnam either hours or days after the initial Gatlin massacre(in this movie that's 1973, but in the first film that was 1980 or 81.  Oh, well!), and barely escapes with his life.  That's probably the biggest relationship to the series right there.  Why his wife's child is evil and supernatural is either a bad coincidence or the evil of Gatlin kinda followed him to California.  Plus, Drago seems to be trying to start a whole new Children of the Corn cult in the desert.  Hence the title ""Genesis"" perhaps?
I do like that this film was kinda vague, and didn't explain too much.  People might think this makes the movie confusing or seem sloppy, but to me it makes it a bit more mysterious and even creepy at times.  The previous sequels suffered from explaining too much and adding too many ridiculous plot points.  Examples?  Sure!  How about the stunt of bringing back a much older Issac to lead the children in Part 6?  Or blaming rotten corn to explain the murderous behavior of the children in Part 2?  And who can forget the bad decision of actually showing ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" as a silly looking, cartoonish monster in Part 3?  Or just trying to rewrite history in Part 4(it was a remake more or less I guess)?
What I'm trying to say is that regardless of what some reviewers complain about, this series has definitely been sillier and more uninspired at times.
So, while Genesis doesn't have all the hallmarks of the previous films, and may not be terribly original on it's own, I do like the effort.......and it wasn't really all that bad.",1333497600,4,4305,4.494858611825193

COTC GENESIS is the latest entry and probably the most boring one.  There's hardly any children in this fiasco and no real resemblance to the original storyline.  The inclusion of an apparently psychic lad makes no sense nor is there any logical reason Billy Drago has amassed the seldom seen youths.

8454678,3,B0052XU4BK,"I honestly believe that they should have just stopped making sequels to Children of the Corn after 666: Isaac's Return. When I saw the ending my thought was that they couldn't possibly top that for an ending. But, they just kept going on. They made Children of the Corn: Revelation, which, in my opinion added absolutely nothing to the story line at all. It was literally a woman and some kids running around an apartment complex and a convenience store a block or two away. What was up with that?
Anyway, now there is Children of the Corn: Genesis. It's definitely better and more entertaining than the seventh movie, I will tell you that. There was more suspense, and it really keeps you guessing through the movie as you wonder what's going on. Compared to the seventh movie (during which I found my phone more interesting), the people who made this movie did a really good job working on pulling me back into the story line after the abysmal mess of the seventh movie, which can be really hard to pull off for even the best movie franchises.
In conclusion, if you are someone who would like to see if Children of the Corn was able to redeem the franchise with this eighth movie, then you should see this movie. Maybe you'll think it works, maybe you'll think it won't, but it might be fun giving it a try.",1470614400,2,1309,4.481171548117155
