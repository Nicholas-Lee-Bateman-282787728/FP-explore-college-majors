  The music is great & Michelle is a great motivator plus she's in amazing shape! That being said it still doesn't work for me.
 Save your money!",1380672000,4,420,4.036144578313253
5763841,3,B00CZD0Z14,"I love Michelle's videos and was hoping for a great low impact workout but the
 Moves were just too odd for me. I tried it twice and still find many of the moves uncomfortable.  I will keep trying.",1380672000,,197,4.157894736842105
5763842,4,B00CZD0Z14,"I consider myself an intermediate exerciser and I tried this video yesterday for the first time.  I have a few other Michelle Dozois videos (Peak 10) and I was expecting it to be similar. Boy was I wrong!  When I first started, I was worried and thought I was going to hate it.  Some of the moves are VERY complex and I just didn't think I could do it.  I did the best that I could, and I'd say there were only a few moves I couldn't do.  I felt so good afterwards, I'm glad I pushed through it.  I didn't get my heart rate up as much as I do with the Peak 10 workouts, but I felt really energized and my whole body felt stretched out, more than I usually feel on a cardio or cardio/strength video.  I will definitely  keep it in my rotation, and I think as I get in even better shape and gain more flexibility, I'll be able to do all of the moves.",1378598400,2,848,3.947058823529412
5763843,5,B00CZD0Z14,"I have over 300 workout DVDs in my collection -- and this new one by Michelle Dozois is like anything I own!

It's this wonderful blend of dance, yoga, plyo, and functional fitness moves set to great dance music.  The closest things I can compare it to are the Buti and Dream Body workouts, but this is so much more fun!

Michelle is an exceptional cuer, and she breaks down the moves so that they're easy to follow. If you have two left feet, there is also an instructional section, where she goes over some of the more challenging moves before you do the workout.

To do this workout, all you need is a mat.  It's done barefoot, but really gets your heart rate up there!

I love all of Michelle's workouts, and got amazing results when I did her Peak Fit System workout when it first came out.  I hope she puts out more of this style of workout! I'll be first in line to order when a Body Fit 360 Part 2 comes out!  :-)",1371772800,8,921,4.163841807909605
5763844,5,B00CZD0Z14,"I'm an advanced exerciser who loves a good hard and challenging workout. I tried this workout because I love Michelle and have all of her Peak Fit workouts. I have to say that I LOVED this one! I smiled throughout the whole workout which is something that I haven't done in a long time! The moves were great and combined cardio, strength, and flexibility. The music was amazing and Michelle has great cueing. I think as you get used to the moves you will be able to put more into this workout. I have 2 left feet and found this workout easy to follow. I highly recommend this workout for anyone looking for something fun and different.",1370908800,16,635,4.435897435897436
5763845,5,B00CZD0Z14,I am totally amazed with Michelle and the things she does.  She has changed my life.  I have done it all and have shelves of workout DVD's.  This is he real deal.  BUY IT!,1424044800,2,171,3.9411764705882355
5763846,5,B00CZD0Z14,"The first time I did this workout, I had only planned on doing half of it, but it was so much fun that I decided to do the whole thing.  It's such a feel-good workout!

This workout is meant to be done barefoot, and you'll just need a yoga mat to do it.

It's broken down into two thirty-minute sections: the first segment is the actual cardio/dance workout and the second segment is this amazing yoga-based stretch sequence.  I normally avoid long stretching workouts since I find them tedious (which is why I had planned on doing just the first half of this), but this was so relaxing and nice.

Michelle, as always, is a fantastic instructor, and her cueing is great.  As with the other newest BodyFit release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bodyfit-360-Bodyweight-Athletic-Conditioning-with-Michelle-Dozois/dp/B00QEGOTQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bodyfit 360 Bodyweight Athletic Conditioning with Michelle Dozois</a>, there is a short video you can do ahead of time where Michelle demos the moves, and watching it beforehand really helps.

The moves in this workout also seem more fluid and natural than they did in the Athletic Conditioning workout, and I had fewer problems following along.

The music is also great, and the movements are choreographed to loosely follow along with the songs.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun, challenging workout, this is a great one to add to your collection! I have all three of the Bodyfit DVDs, and this one is my favorite.",1420588800,12,1516,5.362869198312236
5763847,5,B00CZD0Z14,"It is hard to come up with a new work out these days, but this one is new and innovative. It's like a combo of pilates, yoga, belly dancing, plyometrics, aerobic dancing etc. I rotate between Jillian Michaels, Turbo Fire, Insanity, Jackie Warner and Michelle Doizois. I really like the way Michelle ques. Her Peak 10 Cardio Resistance workouts are awesome as well. I like this one when I'm looking for less impact, more stretching, and some fun. Some of the music has a bit of a tribal sound to it and is really fun workout with. This is quite literally a work out with a whole new twist.",1420416000,5,588,4.4036697247706424
5763848,5,B00CZD0Z14,"This workout continues in the same vein as the original BodyFIT 360 - it's a challenging and fast-paced fusion workout.

The workout is basically split into a cardio half and a strengthening half.  The cardio is nonstop, fast and contemporary dance inspired.  The strength portion is presented in a lively flow w/elements of yoga and Pilates. This is a high energy and challenging workout.  I particularly enjoy the cardio half, it's so much fun!

Michelle is a fantastic instructor - she's energetic, has a fun vibe and is great at cueing.

All of the BodyFIT 360's have awesome music.  The moves are choreographed to sync up with it.  I think that the music accompanying the strength section in Volume 2 is quite noteworthy.

I've got all 3 of the BodyFIT 360's and I honestly don't have any other workouts that I enjoy more.",1419897600,8,827,4.7272727272727275
5763849,4,B00CZD0Z14,"I just finish this workout and I will like to write a review about it since I reviews have been really helpful for me when I it comes to which workout to choose. This is a type of workout that when you finish you feel good and refresh, the first 25 minutes you move at a fast paced which will cause your heat rate to go up and is not insanity fast paced but I did feel my heart rate going up then  is followed by about 5 minutes of slow paced exercises for flexibility and then core and you finish up with a nice and relax stretch. This workout was about 54 minutes total and the time went fast because Michelle is constantly  changing the exercises so you do not have time to get bore. Best of all when I finished I was feeling really good. This workout I would say that is not for beginners since you have to have some  flexibility to perform most of the exercises here. This workout will be good to develop long and lean muscles.  I did 30 minutes of Tracy Anderson Metamorphosis Glutecentric and I finished with Michelle Dozois workout and I feel great.",1418515200,10,1057,4.217821782178218
5763850,5,B00CZD0Z14,I loved this! There were great cardio benefits plus great stretching . I would definitely buy a sequel. Wish I had bought this sooner,1403568000,,133,4.583333333333333
5763851,4,B00CZD0Z14,This is a wonderful workout. Pretty strenuous with a couple of moves that I cannot do. However it is easy to modify them. I would have given the workout 5 stars but the person who is modifying on the video doesn't really show much modification and you are left figuring out your own ways to adjust the workout. I am 56 and in good shape and this workout delivers a great comprehensive group of moves that get your heart rate up but help increase your flexibility. Michelle has a great way of leading without being too chatty and annoying.,1398297600,4,538,4.444444444444445
5763852,5,B00CZD0Z14,"Having done Michelle's Peak 10 workouts, I didn't quite know what to expect from this BodyFit workout.  When Michelle said that this is a good workout to do after strenuous Peak 10 videos, I was intrigued and bought it.

Michelle accomplishes something truly unique and effective with this workout.  You will move 360 degrees; you will work every part of your body; you will do yoga, pilates, and a fusion blend of both; you will sweat; you will be challenged; you will get stretched out; you will have FUN.  This is not an easy workout - MIchelle moves quickly and you'll benefit greatly from watching the Movement Review she provides at the beginning and practicing the moves first.  But after doing the workout a few times, you'll get the hang of it and enjoy it.

After this workout, I feel relaxed, stretched out to the max, and like I've done a good, challenging workout.  There's nothing like it and I hope Michelle makes more!",1397692800,6,934,4.658536585365853
5763853,4,B00CZD0Z14,"This workout is a good one for the whole body. Building strength, agility, without using equipments which is nice. I am used to doing Cathe's  and kelly Coffey Meyer,(now i am slowing down so  am doing parts of those workouts at a time). it is a nice change to have a different style exercises. This workout is also different from Michelle's own previous dvd,(less impact) . it has a nice variety of moves, some which are reminding of dance type moves. Not much impact but still gets your heart rate up. Could not finish the whole thing the first time. Giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because some of the moves are not flowing, and some require quite a lot of practice to get to do it well..",1389484800,,691,4.348837209302325
5763854,5,B00CZD0Z14,"I'm 58 and have worked out off and on through the years starting w/Jane Fonda, moving on to Kathy Smith and so on through the years.  I've tried the Jillian Michaels workouts, don't care for her style, and have even tried the P90X and even Shaun T's insanity. I love variety and most workouts are effective, you just have to do them. I recently discovered Michelle Dozois and I have to say that this woman is a fantastic instructor.  She really knows her stuff and her dance background reflects in this workout, although I would not call this a dance workout at all.  I watched the video several times before actually doing it so that I could follow her without looking at the screen.  This is different, fun and a great workout. I can feel and see the results. I am older and this type of workout helps me to not only stay in shape, but it keeps me limber.  Do not give up after one time, I urge you to stay with this, you will master the moves.  You were not born knowing how to walk, but you did it.  If you still are not convinced then I would urge you to check out her other dvds, she is  a wonderful Pilates instructor as well. Good luck to all.",1381536000,22,1151,4.2
8587866,5,B00CZD0Z14,"This is challenging and gets you sweaty but without weights or any equipment. Not even shoes! I consider myself pretty fit but I'm just worn out on hardcore HIIT style workouts and this does the trick. I also like how she infuses a bit of yoga into the mix.

PS: Not for newbies. Definitely more intermediate to advanced. I do hope we see more from her in the future. It's almost like a faster moving Piyo.",1526256000,,406,4.342105263157895

8587868,3,B00CZD0Z14,"I was disappointed with this video as it is very high impact and I mistakenly thought it was a lower impact, but higher and harder cardio workout.  It would be great for someone looking for a very high impact workout though.",1485475200,,224,4.463414634146342
8587869,4,B00CZD0Z14,"I like this workout a lot for cardio and flexibility work. As advertised, the moves help me to stretch my muscles and loosen up my joints. Doing that as I'm also getting a cardiovascular workout is pleasant and efficient.

The transitions between moves are too fast for me to maintain good form, however. The moves are challenging but not super hard. They are super fast, though.  I slowed down somewhat, but still felt some of the potential benefits got lost in the shuffle. The strength training aspect of the moves, especially for the core, was undermined by the speed.

I should note that I'm a 45 year old woman, an intermediate exerciser with some dance background. I assume I'll get better at the form over time. This workout is worth the effort, I think, but at the same time I don't see it becoming a part of my core rotation.",1463616000,3,835,4.553333333333334
8587870,5,B00CZD0Z14,"This challenging workout is energizing, smart, & has a great flow to it. The variety and music keeps me interested. My strength & flexibility has improved with this workout as well as my fitness level. An added perk is the ability to exercise bare footed!  I highly recommend  this workout. I have quite a collection of workout videos and this is one of my favorites!",1446336000,,367,4.630769230769231
8587871,5,B00CZD0Z14,A wonderful workout.  It is surprisingly challenging.  She will really work you in a completely different way from standard workouts.  I look forward to purchasing more of Michelle Dozois workouts.  The seller ships really fast and I will order more items directly from this seller.,1436745600,2,282,5.2
8587872,5,B00CZD0Z14,"This is a fun, fun, fun workout!  When I got it, I did it 3x's the first week!

The first half of the workout is contemporary dance inspired.  Meaning there's no routine to learn, but you are doing a lot of moves that have a dance feel to them.  The second half of the workout you move to the floor and that's when you see the yoga and Pilates aspects of this workout.  The workout is advanced due to the nonstop nature of the first half and strength required for the second half.  There are a few moves that are confusing.  It definitely took several tries to get them right.  But I feel accomplished for developing the strength to now be able to do them.

The music is great in this one!  It's inspiring and goes with the flow of the workout.  Also the instructor is great.  She seems to be enjoying the workout and that helps me enjoy it too!

I highly recommend this workout for fun and challenge all in one!",1432339200,5,912,4.202312138728324
