8489341,3,B000J354VI,"This DVD was created from old silent movies depicting Easter Island back in the 1950s or thereabouts.  It only runs about 11 minutes in duration.  I happen to be fascinated with Easter Island and found it quite interesting with regard to the appearance of the island at that time.  In particular, the use of the island in sheep ranching was evident from the unloading of sheep from a ship anchored offshore.  There was also footage or Rano Raraku, Rano Kau, and other landmark locations.  The only standing moai were those at the quarry, which makes sense given that restoration of the ahu did not commence until the 1960s.  This DVD should be purchased by ""Rapanuiphiles"" but probably not by anyone looking for general information about Easter Island.",1234742400,,752,4.881889763779528
