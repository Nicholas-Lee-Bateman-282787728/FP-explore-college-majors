6508497,5,B00LWB95UW,"Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends (St. John 15:13).

This scriptural verse is most apt in describing the sacrifice of St. Maximillian Maria Kolbe and this biopic as a whole. Originally made in 1991, it is only now that this film, which was a joint Polish/German venture, is available via DVD to the audiences here in North America. It is a genuine effort that strives to bring to the forefront the life and character of this man whom St. John Paul II called ""the Patron of our difficult times""
Though the film itself seems a little dated the message of the film is timeless as it brings to the forefront the crux of the Christian vocation, whether it be a religious or a lay one.

Amidst the horrors of Auschwitz, the darkness of human cruelty which relegates mankind to mere nothings, desensitizes, dehumanizes the individual to their suffering neighbours, there is a bright light; a effulgent light that dispels the darkness of inhumanity and allows the brightness of Christ's mercy and love to flood it. This light is in the form of a Catholic priest, a Fr. Maximillian Kolbe. A person who, amidst the other prisoners, seems lost in the crowd but then in a flash steps forward towering in his love of neighbor; stepping forward to take the place of  a family man condemned to die unjustly because a prisoner has escaped. Retribution means that 10 prisoners are to be killed in the escapees place. What about the escapee? Jan by name. He learns of the consequences of his decision. Racked by guilt, he tries to justify himself. However when he hears the sacrifice of Fr. Kolbe he is intrigued. He goes in search of this seemingly elusive man. Concealing the truth about himself, he dexterously `interviews' the many individuals who knew Fr. Kolbe, and slowly and steadily the nature, character and personality of Fr. Kolbe is unraveled to the viewer in a series of flash backs. At a time of self survival, at first glance,this seemingly trivial episode shakes the nation. Is it a true story? Did it really happen or is it a moral play or an old wife's tale? How could anyone be so unselfish? What was in it for Kolbe? These and many other questions are raised in the course of this film. Like Christ, Fr. Kolbe becomes a sign of contradiction. As if to counter the disbelief of many, the brothers of the monastery founded by St. Maximillian try to piece together the events of that fateful day, for to them this noble act by their founder is truly worthy of belief. Amazingly, for a film of 90 minutes, no stone is left unturned in presenting the viewer with the complete life story of this remarkable man.

As Christ was triumphant over death, so too is this story triumphant in its  apparent defeat.

As mentioned earlier this film is a little dated and it is seen in the picture quality (the picture is pristine; it's like watching a 90's show today). The movie is cleverly done in that though this is a biopic , the events in Fr. Maximillian's life do not follow a chronological order. This is refreshing as the viewer is able to appreciate all the events without making it feel like a biography. The spirituality of Fr. Kolbe which was very Marian really stands out. Also the internal turmoil and guilt suffered by Jan is well portrayed by the actor Christoph Waltz. The viewer is conflicted with regard to his/her feelings towards him. The gentleness of Maximillian Kolbe is superbly enacted by Edward Zentara.

The inhumane conditions suffered at Auschwitz during their incarceration and the tragedies that occurred at liberation are very realistic and disturbing. Hence parents should be careful in showing this film to younger children. A safe rating would be PG-13.

In addition to the full feature movie which is 90 minutes long in Polish, along with an admixture of German, Russian and Italian, with subtitles in English and Spanish, this disc contains scene selections, subtitle options and film trailers.

This film comes with a wonderful trademark booklet with the following topics:

1. About the film by Steven Greydanus.
2. The year of Maximillian Kolbe by Marek Trzcinski, Senator of the Republic of  Poland
3. Maximillian Kolbe: Knight of the Immaculata by Fr. Stanislaw M.Pietka
4. Key dates
5. Discussion questions
6. Scene Selections

This 17 page booklet is in full colour with stills from the film.

This film would be suitable for anyone and everyone. St. Maximillian teaches us what it is to live out an authentic Christian faith and to live and die in the service of God. This film will appeal to both young and old. Highly recommended for parish groups like the Legion of Mary as it has a very strong Marian devotion at its core (which St. Maximillian was renowned for) and for young people who are to be Confirmed, as it is illustrative of what it means to live and die for the faith.

6508509,3,B00LWB95UW,"ATTENTION WYD folks...  If you purchased this DVD and it doesn't play, reach out to Ignatius Press, the company who produced this movie. I purchased Ocean of Mercy, Life for Life, and Faustina in preparation for my pilgrimage to Krakow in July, and found that all 3 DVD's wouldn't play.

I tested the DVD's on 2 laptop computers and a media DVD player with the same results. Lets face it, mass producing a CD or DVD will sometimes result in a bad copy or even batch. I've experienced this before and since all 3 DVD's came from the same manufacturer, the risk of receiving 3 more unplayable movies (from Amazon) was pretty high (after all, is it a bad batch of DVD's or are all of my players truly defective).

After speaking to Gene with Ignatius customer support, He indicated that a very small percentage of movies occasionally will not work on a customers player for various reasons. That said, he contacted their manufacturer to insure that I receive copies that do work.

NOTE: I've rated this DVD as a ""3 star"" not for content, but because the DVD doesn't work as expected. That can certainly change depending on the outcome from Ignatius Press. With WYD coming fast, I wanted to let others know, should they be affected as I was. Not a huge deal, but If you will show this with friends, make sure you test your movie first!

Look for my update in the future!",1459987200,8,1366,4.51417004048583

Details on the life of St Maximillian shows his devotion to the blessed Mother his love for the prisoners in the camp, the way he cared for them even until death. The courage he has given to many through his strong faith in God and his love for the Blessed Mother and his obedience and dedication to his duties as a Catholic priest.

6508522,5,B00LWB95UW,"Amazing movie - not only for its subject matter, not even just for the nearly flawless performance of its actors, but also for the genius of its director in making a movie in which its chief subject is seen only through the eyes of others, and even then often from quite some distance.

The movie inspired me to learn more about the life and death of Saint Maxmilian Kolbe. It was interesting to find out how much we actually did not know about the precise circumstances surrounding his heroic act of self sacrifice. For one thing, the main character in this move is Jan, the supposed escapee from Auschwitz, whose escape prompted the camp commandant to cruelly execute 10 prisoners taken at random by starvation and thirst. But the records are not at all clear about the details of the (alleged) escape. In fact to this day, we do not know for certain the identity of this escapee, or even whether he existed at all. Some accounts say there were 2 (or even 3) prisoners who managed to get away; others say that no one did - that one unfortunate prisoner had fallen into a latrine and drowned, his body not being found until long after the 10 hostages had been murdered.  But in the end, that does not matter. Director Krzysztof Zanussi's decision to allow the viewer to learn about the remarkable life of Kolbe through the eyes of a (possibly fictional) person indirectly responsible for his death was perfection. No mere biopic here, with a woodenly chronological portrayal of events. Instead Saint Kolbe's life story is slowly revealed to us piece by piece as Jan struggles to learn just who died (even if only indirectly) due to his own actions. My favorite scene? Near the end, as an atheist, Polish Communist Party bureaucrat years later refuses to sully the name of the saint, even when his career is threatened by the party bosses.

I do agree with film critic Steve Greydanus that the movie has but a single flaw - the scene where deputy camp commandant, SS-Hauptsturmfhrer Karl Fritzsch, explains to a fellow officer why he allowed Kolbe to substitute himself for the other prisoner as one of those selected to die. Totally gratuitous error. But the scene is less than a minute long, and is but a minor blemish on an otherwise nearly perfect movie.

I will certainly be watching this movie again, and recommending it to others.",1429488000,10,2337,4.678832116788321

To be able to do what he did in the face of advercity and with his unshakable faith in god,he will always be remembered for who he was and his sacrifice for a fellow man,unlike the germans who will always be remembered for their atrocities and war crimes.

6508540,4,B00LWB95UW,"Life for Life: Maximilian Kolbe is a recent movie release by Ignatius Press of a movie that was originally released in 1991. The film gets the title from the story of how Maximilian Kolbe took the place of another prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1941, and ultimately gave up his own life. If the movie was about this alone it would have been enough for me, as it would show how modern day people can be like Jesus. Instead, the film decided to make that story more of a back-story.

The movie begins showing life and work in a concentration camp. There is little to no dialogue at all, just many people working and the sound of machinery squeaking and honestly making an awful sound. We then see a man, Jan, digging in a pile of dirt that collapses on him. I believe it was intentional, but the way he emerges from the dirt, you'd think he almost died down there. Work has ended for the day, so he uses that moment to escape. Because of his escape, ten people will now die. As stated above, Kolbe is not one of the ones selected to die, but takes the place of one.

Jan's survivor's guilt and guilt that ten men died because of him serves as a big part of the story. I wish that they had started at the beginning of Kolbe's life and walked us through up to his heroic death in Auschwitz. Instead, we got this artistic view of Kolbe instead. Another point that made the movie a bit difficult to watch was that it was in Polish. As I've said before, I'm not a fan of reading while watching a movie, because you can miss a lot and you are left at the mercy of the translator. I did appreciate there being an Ignatius Press study guide included with the DVD. Overall, I'd give this move 4 stars.",1422230400,10,1707,4.265432098765432

Having said that, I was very disappointed in this movie. The story of St. Maximilian served more as a backdrop in this movie, as the story was more about the man who escaped causing the retaliation by the Nazis. And so it seemed that we never really got to know or hardly even see Maximilion in this movie.

We see Maximilian's heroic sacrifice: ""Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13). For me there was no spiritually uplifting feeling at the end of the movie; only the intellectual acknowledgement that good was done in the midst of the seeming endless blackness of the Nazi holocaust machine.
