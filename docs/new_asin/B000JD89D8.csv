8150039,5,B000JD89D8,"This move, originally aired as a TV series according to the flier included, was released in 1976.  It is directed by Harry Kumel, best known for Daughters of Darkness and Malpertius.  I have only seen Malpertius (a must-see, with Orson Welles in the cast), but I loved it, so I took a chance with this.  Please note I saw it on my region-free DVD player, and probably American-only dvd players won't be able to play it because of PAL or region incompatibility.

Without going into the entire concept, since it was based on a ""magic realism"" novel, I must say the leisurely pace (it's 153 minutes long!), the high production values, and quite well done early special effects combine to make this a memorable and truly mesmerizing movie.  To be honest during the first 30 minutes or so I fell asleep and had to restart the next day, but once the pace picks up it's hard to turn away from this oddly compelling experience.  In the end, it may not make a whole lot of sense, but as I grew up in the era, I was quite taken with this kind of drama in the 1970's, and stricken with nostalgia for a time in which people talked and entertained themselves quite differently than our instagram world.  Too, this is about a generation that grew up very young in wartime Netherlands -- which must have scarred a great many people.  The actresses in this production, by the way, are uniformly good and most are quite beautiful.  This being a European production, there is some casual nudity and one or two somewhat graphic scenes of violence.  And if you like this run, don't walk, and get the Barrell dvd of Malpertius, which is one of the few dvds I have in which the extras are somewhat more entertaining than the movie -- a funny and amazing making of documentary which focuses on Orson Welles and the director, Harry Kumel.",1383350400,,1814,4.519877675840979
