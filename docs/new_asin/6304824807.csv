7877937,5,6304824807,"Fire Emblem was originally a game on the Nintendo Famicom (Japanese version of the NES). But it wasn't seen as a game in the US until characters from it appeared in Super Smash Bros Melee. However this rare anime was brought to the US long before that, 1998 according to Amazon.com and [...]. It is really awesome, and when I saw it from watching this video tape it was the first time I'd seen the character Marth do battle OUTSIDE of the game Super Smash Bros Melee. It's really cool being able to see one of your favorite video game characters do battle in an anime, just seriously AWESOME!",1285545600,,592,4.440366972477064
7877938,2,6304824807,"perosnally this movie was half bad and half good

good a way to show fire emblem mars and all the charters were good but the green archer i hated.

the bad part was it was way to short cmon they didn't evan defeat the main ememey that killed mars is father and it was only an hour long personlly this ova needs to be reralesd on dvd extend verson and make it as long as the four ova epsidoes like darkstallkers nightwarriors which is about close to 3 hours but is would be asome i mean cnom fire emblem is war they must keep fighting until the main viallin is dead i mean really nintendo pls reralse this on dvd extend and make it long like lord of the rings really pls then this ova would kick ass just take all the chaperters of fire emblem sword of light and dragon of darkness from the nes. i mean just do that pls if the fire emblem games sell well pls heck i would care less if you made the chapters shorter so cmon nintend o make the product for what its worth really",1128384000,,974,4.041450777202073
7877939,5,6304824807,"The anime version of Fire Emblem is actually quite a well made OVA. It's too bad they only made two episodes due to weak sales figures of the second, perhaps why the ending is so poor. The sub version is much better than the dub. The dub is, ultimately, just dandy (with the exception of a few awful lines), but the sub version has a highly recognizable and skilled cast, including:

Hikaru Midorikawa (Slayers, Gundam Wing, Outlaw Star), Sakura Tange (Marmalade Boy), Sumi Shimamoto (Sorcerer Hunters,Urusei Yatsura), Nobuyuki Hiyama (The voice of adult Link), Akira Ishida (Gundam Seed, Evangelion), Juurota Kosugi (Zeta Gundam, Martian Successor Nadesico), Akio Ohtsuka (Blue Seed, Gundam Wing), Takehito Koyasu (Evangelion, Gundam Wing), Ai Orikasa (Blue Seed, Saber Marionette), Michiko Neya (Cutey Honey, Full Metal Panic), Kappei Yamaguchi (Ranma 1/2, Record of Lodoss War), and Takeshi Aono (Outlaw Star, Ranma 1/2).

The plot is very well thought out, a traditional RPG plot: the forces of evil from the continent of Akanea have a force to be reckoned with on their bad side: the knights of Aritia. Led by Prince Marth, the son of King Cornelius, as well as his love, Princess Shiida, they travel through dangerous mountains, fighting evil bandits, nasty warriors, and a whole lot more. This is a truly great fantasy anime that could have gone a long way if it hadn't been for weak sales figures. Perhaps other episodes have been released in Japan...but alas, I don't think that we'll be seeing them here any time soon.",1116720000,5,1528,5.011811023622047
7877940,5,6304824807,This movie is an excellent addition to any anime fan. Even if you don't like or haven't played the Fire Emblem Series. This movie is a remake of the BEGINING of the famous Famicom game Fire Emblem Gaiden. NOTE!!! This movie is only episode 1 and 2!!! Other episodes haven't come out yet. So you will not be seeing the whole thing but I do belive there is plans to make for but im not entirely sure (they probally would have allready made them) for more information go to [...] But anyways the anime in this movie is very good and the dubbing is very very well done. I couldn't even tell. Its about an hour long (including credits and advertising. I personally loved this movie and if your a Fire Emblem fan or just a lover of anime this movie is perfect for you!,1079827200,4,762,4.2620689655172415
7877941,5,6304824807,"This happens to be a dubbed version of the smash-hit movie anime movie called Fire Emblem! This is where you see the Smash Bro. named Marth take his place under the pencil as the star of this full hour movie. Where Marth starts out a a young teenager, he soon relized what was to become of him! I won't spoil anything else! This is based of the smash RPG ""Fire Emblem Gaiden"" (Fiya Emabureme Gaiden)! This is a must view tape! Believe me, you won't be sorry!",1052438400,2,458,4.275862068965517
7877942,5,6304824807,"...you only get a taste of the action, considering this isn't all of FIRE EMBLEM. Great animation, you may get lost in the story but considring i read into ahead of time i wasnt. The animation is GREAT, and has great fights in it as well. I highly recomend this anime, to bad you will probibly never see the rest of FIRE EMBLE-*sigh* And if you didn't no, this is based on one of Nntendos best RPG/STRADIGY games!",1023148800,,413,4.3076923076923075
7877943,5,6304824807,"This was a really good fantasy anime! It had good grafics and pretty good voice overs... It had alot of the voice actors/actrices from blue seed and Evangelion (two of the best animes ever!)such as tiffany grant and amanda  winn-lee and ofcourse we can't for get spike spencer (the god of anime  dubbing!)who takes the role of Prince Mars! This is the story of how mars  becomes the great leader that everyone KNOWS is inside of him and how he  leads the country to freedome from the pirates and bandits and much darker  evil forces! The only down side is that this seems to bee the only video in  the series (unless they are planning on comeing out with more some time in  the future{that was a hint for all you anime movie people to get working on  it!})and some things seem to be unanswered but htat is the way things go  some times! It is still a really good video and I would recomend it for  anyone who likes eva or blue seed or record of lodos war( wow I spelled  that really badly)It is really good! BY it NOW (that was my BEST subtle  hinting mixed w/ just aittle bit of sarcasm within thes parentheses, NOT  out side of them) don't mind me I am insane!",930960000,3,1162,4.275229357798165
