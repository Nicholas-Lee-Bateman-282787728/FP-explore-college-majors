7982579,4,B00008G61L,"As eighties action movies goes, this is a pretty good one.

In my humble opinion the Second best movie Eric Roberts ever appeared in, only surpassed by Best Of The Best. Solid action flick that should keep most action fans entertained. Eric Roberts plays a stuntman/spy deeply involved in an intrigue revolving around a group of rogue agents and a set of dokuments, proving their disloyalty.

Also stars Pamela Gidley as a lovely love interest, and Jeff Fahey as the bad guy.",1481241600,,475,4.780487804878049

7982582,5,B00008G61L,Two of my favorite action stars are Eric Roberts and Jeff Fahey and they are both in this movie. You won't be disappointed. Great action and romance to boot.,1388102400,,157,4.448275862068965
7982583,5,B00008G61L,I saw this movie when it first came out on VCR. The scenes between Roberts and the woman could almost be called soft porn. A man could watch this or even a woman.  But I would like to know what would happened if the two watched it together.  It has a fantastic story line.,1366070400,,272,4.018518518518518
7982584,5,B00008G61L,"The editing of this movie makes it alittle unusual.  The characters were not fully developed.  But it is a star studded cast and the story line was unpredictable.  I esp love the scenery and the paragliding - it was breath taking.  This was Eric Roberts at his finest by the way.  There was suspense, action, mystery and no wasted dialog.  With just a few more lines of dialog i might have said that this was a girl's movie (with macho men etc) but given that there was less dialogue, it might appear to any adult enjoying sexual suspense and mystery.  Not for children.",1354060800,,570,4.475728155339806
