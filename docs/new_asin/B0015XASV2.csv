3148377,5,B0015XASV2,"This is a fantastic set, it has it all from engineering disasters to great documentaries. Well put together as you would expect from any History Channel set, if you are going to buy anything buy this you will not be dissapointed. Good value for money , even though I had it shipped in from the States. To get what they put into this seperately would cost you a fortune this is a real credit to the makers of this great series-keep it up History Channel.",1268092800,2,453,4.341176470588235

3148379,5,B0015XASV2,I agree with the other reviewer that this is not the best collection of the Modern Marvels but still interesting enough to recommend this DVD set. I especially enjoyed all the engineering disasters.,1263427200,,198,5.03030303030303
3148380,3,B0015XASV2,"I love documentaries, and Modern Marvels in particular.  To my disappointment, this box set was just OK.

First, as mentioned before, the first four or five discs are all about Engineering Disasters, and I even think one of the disasters runs on two of the dvds.  Though they are alright, they aren't Modern Marvel episodes.

Second, the episodes that are Modern Marvels aren't the BEST.  I can think of two episodes I really wanted to see ... Salt Mines, and Oil Refineries ... aren't on here.  7 of the episodes are about Bridges, and not the bridges you really want to see.  Over all, for $30, it is ok.",1260316800,22,606,4.504587155963303

8260304,3,B0015XASV2,"I give these videos 5 stars.  I take away two for the selection.

It's always sort of amazing to me, how people nowadays who make documentaries think ""edgy and sensational"" must be what people want.  I love Modern Marvels.  They are one of the few documentaries out there that explain everyday subjects for educational purposes, sort of what you always wanted those classroom videos in school to really be.

I use them for homeschooling.  The ones on Brewing and Metals and Acids are GREAT for chemistry and biology students.  How I wish, oh wish, the editors would GET that!  Have THEMED sets.  Why not a chemistry oriented set?  A biology set?  An economic set?  (The ""Stock Market"" video was one of the best documentaries I've ever seen).  These videos steer pretty clear of PC bias and explain concepts in a way that is interesting and informative.

I would LOVE a set with all their elements, such as Acid, Aluminum, Carbon, etc.  They have Fungi and Brewing and Bread for Biology.  And I certainly don't want the Sex ones.  Their disaster ones are very interesting but not the ones I want, except perhaps for one or two that illustrate, for example, methane explosions.

Sometimes the marketing people don't really understand the demand for the product.  These can be great educational videos, the homeschooling market would love it, properly marketed!  Homeschoolers are a huge market (there are MILLIONS of homeschoolers in the US, people don't realize) and they tend to teach by THEME.  MM could take a set, market it as an adjunct to a unit study.  They would do excellently.",1344643200,10,1585,4.814126394052044
8260305,5,B0015XASV2,"Cool set.  A lot of very interesting technological marvels, as well as some of the worst engineering blunders of all time.  Also a great insight that safety does come first!  Many of the engineering disasters shown in this set could have been easily prevented with a little common sense and re-thinking before they started their work!  I got the set on sale (cheap!) which made it an even better purchase.",1315180800,,405,4.742857142857143
8260306,5,B0015XASV2,"I purchased these since I remembered watching them often growing up. Despite the age of some episodes its amazing how relevant and educational they remain today.

Initially I was disappointed by the number of ""Engineering Disasters"" episodes included. But after watching them all, I'm happy they were included.

This is a very good dvd set for the price. If you break it down into dollar per hour, it's very cheap entertainment.",1296691200,,428,5.014084507042254
8260307,5,B0015XASV2,"I have not managed to get through all of the dvds just yet, but it has been very interesting and educational to watch. I find myself watching it for hours. There are lots of fascinating ""Engineering Disasters"" featured as well as many other subjects explored. I am repeatedly amazed at the disasters, which most I was unaware of, that shaped the development of better technology and engineering. For 2115 mins of viewing its a great purchase.",1295654400,,442,4.828947368421052
8260308,5,B0015XASV2,"The collection offers a wonderful selection of some of the best programs. If you enjoy watching Modern Marvels, you'll be in heaven!",1295481600,,132,5.045454545454546
