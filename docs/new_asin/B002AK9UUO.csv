3884293,5,B002AK9UUO,"I am still relatively new to CT, having first become interested in them during their PBS presentation in February, 2016.  I am in the process of collecting the various DVDs that have been released over the past nine years or so, and Im enjoying all of them so far.  I only wish I hadnt been so late to the party! But Im enjoying myself tremendously now.

Take Me Home is my most recent purchase, and I know there are many reviews of it from the time it was released, but I wanted to offer my own take on it and say that Im going to have to go against the consensus of a lot of previous critiques on this site.  I thoroughly enjoy watching the performances, plus the visual quality of the DVD is outstanding.  It isn't blu-ray, but the clarity is incredible.

I thought the performers were simply wonderful, as usual.  It was interesting to see how much Damian had grown and how much his voice had matured since The Show.  He seemed more confident and sure of himself, but he had a few awkward moments vocally, particularly in Raggle Taggle.  I loved the newer versions of Over the Hills and Bird Without Wings.  Both were simply beautiful.  George was typically consistent, and I truly love his thoughtful rendition of Working Man, but Yesterdays Men and 500 Miles are equally noteworthy.

Ryan, as pointed out by others, appeared thinner, but to me he seemed neither gaunt nor haggard.  To the contrary, he looked very trim and fit, and during Ride On he bounded all over the stage with energy I wish I still possessed!  Desperado was beautifully done, and Heartbreaker is fun to watch - I find myself wondering how he keeps from cringing, knowing he is about to get slapped! Paul was a bit devilish, lifting the hem of his kilt during Caledonia to the delighted squeals of the ladies, and he performed a wonderful rendition of Nights in White Satin.  Im not a fan of operatic-style, but I have to give kudos to him and Ryan for Thats a Woman, and their ability to sing (or speak) different melodies at the same time without missing a single note.  Keiths solos of Castles in the Air, Lauren & I, and I Wanna Know What Love Is round out the group, and are certain to be appreciated by his fans.  Having started out watching the more recent material first, though, I have to say that I missed seeing Neil in the front, but hes there on the lead guitar in the background.

Another reviewer pointed out that the audience is barely heard in this video, and while I noticed faint audience response at certain parts, it did seem a bit odd to be watching a concert where there was so little noise from the crowd.  It was most noticeable in 500 Miles, where George is engaging them.  You can see them clapping and responding to events on the stage, sometimes quite enthusiastically, but apparently the sounds were diminished in post-production. Im not sure why, since viewers expect to hear the audiences ovations and reactions to the singers.  It neither makes nor breaks the DVD, but its just something I found odd.

Its true that many of the songs featured in Take Me Home had been done previously in The Show, a fact of which I was already aware when I ordered it.  I was, in fact, interested to see my particular favorites done in a different stage setting, since I didn't like the split orchestra pit in the first DVD.  I am going to concede that The Show was probably a bit superior in its freshness and novelty, but Take Me Home is, in my opinion, is a pretty close second, very enjoyable and very worthy of a place in a CT collection.

There was no visible orchestra in Take Me Home, but there were three violinists and a cellist who provided adequate strings.  The drummer is, as always, mesmerizing to watch.  The band performed two solos, but the last one, Appalachian Round Up was my favorite.

I thoroughly enjoyed this production, and would recommend it to anyone.",1463184000,,3872,4.500715307582261

3884296,5,B002AK9UUO,"I must say the reviews for this DVD were not at all helpful, and that was a disappointment because the reviews usually provide a good shopping guide.  Part of the misinformation might come for the fact some parts of the reviews are related to the CD instead of the DVD.

There were complaints that Keith sang only one song, and that song was included in Act II.  He appeared to be merely walking through his performance and the others looked tired.

Someone observed that Damien needed more mature material and that he performed songs that was too immature for his changing voice.  The fact that his voice cracked during the show seemed to surprise him.

Ryan was described as darting looks here and there, not giving his trademark delivery.

Most of these songs, so the reviewers said, appeared on The Show with no new material to be offered.  So I decided this was a recording I could skip.

Then I discovered that Keiths only solo does not appear in the Act II DVD.  It might be included in the CD but not the DVD.  So I purchased the DVD for this one song.

I will admit the first time I listened to the DVD I was not impressed.  The second listen gave a better impression.  The third even better.

First, this is not a repeat of The Show.  There are some similarities but much of that is song selection.  In this production there is no orchestra.  There are about eight musicians in the band, therefore the performances cannot be expected to sound as full as what a larger musical section might provide.

There are complaints that Keith sings only one solo, however both Paul and Ryan are featured only once as well.  George and Damien each sing only one solo as well, because in other selections they are joined by the rest of Celtic Thunder, or in Damiens case, the members of the band.  In fact, it is the Celtic Thunder band who is favored in the show, preforming not one but two instrumentals.

Keith did not appear to me to be walking through preformances, but instead seemed to concentrating on his part in the show.  Damiens voice might be in flux here but that is a fact of anatomy, and should not be offered as a criticism.  I thought he sang beautifully and can look back at this performance with pride.  Ryan may look about as he sings but any performer should look at the audience and there is a large audience here to observe.  And he never misses a note.  George and Paul give beautiful preformances in their solos.

So what is the problem with this video?  Camera shots are a little awkward, especially in the early part of the show.  It appears as if the cameramen might have had a run-through of what was to be filmed on the empty stage without lighting or performers.  At first they don't seem to be certain where the performers will enter or where they will stop to deliver their vocals.  Some of this unevenness seems to go away as the show progresses.
The blue lights at the opening are rather strong but remember they are supposed to be at sea during a storm so the light would be muted and hazy.

So what is so wrong with this show?  After watching it a couple times I concluded the problem is we cant hear the audience.  Clearly Celtic Thunder is preforming in front of a large audience.  Rows and row of fans are seen in camera shots, but the SOUND of the audience is not included on the recording.  The audience is there, they appear enthusiastic, the performers interact with them, and invited them to sing along, but their responses are muted and that lack of sound is disorienting to the viewer.

At first I thought there was poor sound but the singers and the musicians come through loud and clear.  However, the audiences response has been edited out of the program.  Some listeners are annoyed by audience sounds when they listen to a concert, and they may welcome this editing job, but I had to listen a couple times to adjust to the fact what I was seeing was not what I was hearing.

And once I understood what was odd about the show, I started noticing the points I did like.  With the smaller band, it is a more intimate show.  It feels like one is seeing a performance at a small theater or a local pub, rather than a large venue.  Maybe it is that quality that prompted the label amateurish.

But it is a nice sampler of the groups work, and I find it is the one I think of when I want to watch a Celtic Thunder DVD.  Its a nice program of their standards, plus a few new songs, delivered in an intimate setting with great accompaniment and delightful energy.  Im happy I decided to purchase it after all.",1457827200,,4550,4.400479616306955

3884446,5,B002AK9UUO,I love this group of Irish and Scottish men with varied ages with voices that blend so well in harmony for the entire DVD. This DVD can be watched and listened to by the whole family. My sister introduced me to their music and I fell in love with them and have bought every CD and DVD they've done. They are just as good in live concer settings too.,1355443200,,349,4.072463768115942

If you've never heard or seen them, make the splurge and I believe you will be happy with it.  Very much for the whole family.  Pure entertainment!  I almost have everything they have put out both on CD and DVD.  Saw them two weeks ago for the first time and am so hooked.",1355356800,,411,4.205128205128205

The only thing I would have to say negative about this dvd is  that it wasn't as well directed as their others so it didn't look as if it was as professionally done but that was not their fault.",1354233600,,293,4.051724137931035
3884450,5,B002AK9UUO,"Another high entertainment value has been produced by the talented cast of Celtic Thunder again.

Each and every performer has risen to the high standards that is expected from these people and in my opinion, Damian excels in his role.  Probably because he performs some of my most favourite songs.  I have accepted Keith, Damian and Ryan as my personal favourites but I really do enjoy each and every one of them.

Do yourself a favour and buy this album for many hours of pleasurable viewing.

I hope they produce more DVDs so I may add them to my collection.  Simply put, I just can not get enough of these guys.",1342224000,,615,4.495495495495495

I could listen to the music and escape my saddness for a time.

3884469,2,B002AK9UUO,"Haven't cracked open the DVD and I'm already disappointed. This wasn't my favorite of their CDs, but I had some favorite songs that belonged to this particular performance and was looking forward to finally seeing ""Midnight Well"", in particular, performed.

I was very irritated when I saw on the back of the cover that there is no ""Midnight Well"" -- on of the best songs in Take Me Home -- nor ""Home of Donegal"", nor ""Wichita Lineman"". Basically, none of the newer songs I liked were there. HUGE disappointment. I feel like I rebought CELTIC THUNDER THE SHOW.

Why release TAKE ME HOME if you're going to leave out the best songs? Especially since so many of the songs don't belong to TAKE ME HOME but to CELTIC THUNDER THE SHOW?

I would not have bought this DVD if there had been a decent song list. So here one is:

1) Heartland (on 1st DVD; repeat)
2) Castles in the Air (new)
3) Yesterday's Man (repeat)
4) Breakfast Polka/Pennsylvania Railroad (new)
5) Ride One (repeat)
6) Come By the Hills (repeat)

8) Raggle Taggle Gypsy (repeat)
9) Desperado (repeat)

13) A Bird Without Wings (repeat)
14) Remember Me/Receurdame (repeat)
15) Take Me Home (new)
16) Heartbreaker (repeat)
17) Nights in White Satin (repeat)
18) Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen (new)
19) Lauren & I (repeat)

27) Ireland's Call (repeat)

3884470,2,B002AK9UUO,"As I've read in many reviews already, I was totally disappointed in this DVD.  I have all of their other DVD's and have played them over and over.  I'm not sure I'd even play this one a 2nd time.  The lighting and videography stunk! The guys are terrific singers and entertainers and the look of this DVD was so awful, I could barely stand to watch it. Nothing new really except 2 songs by Damian and the band was also great, as usual.  Whoever threw this one together made a lemon this time.  The guys and their whole production crew (orchestra, musicians) as well as their fans deserve better! I wish I had purchased the CD this time.  I think DECCA needs to make this right and do a ""make-over"" on this one.  I hope they never use that set again for any of their DVD concerts....AWFUL, just AWFUL!!",1298678400,,801,4.3355704697986575

3884476,3,B002AK9UUO,"I have watched a concert on TV of Celtic Thunder before and loved it/them.  Celtic Thunder: Tape Me Home, I ordered on DVD and is was very disappointing to watch as the person doing the video taping seemed like an amateur. The camera at times doesn't seem to know where it is supposed to be pointing for one. There were times the camera wasn't still, like it was being taped by someone in the audience or back stage just for personal use or something. The beginning was too dark as well as a few other parts.

On another note, I have always wondered why this talented group of handsome, talented singers/artists, find it necessary to do more than Celtic music.  Doing ""American"" pop/rock songs (Desperado, for example) is necessary.  Just because they have the ability to do those songs well, doesn't mean they should. It feels like they are only doing it as a way to get a broader array of people to listen...however, the Celtic music alone is beautiful and for those truly into Celtic music, the rest isn't necessary. In fact, Keith Harkin, sang an ""American"" song that required some feeling, not just his good voice, to sing it so it made the song rather dull. His voice is too sexy for that.",1289865600,,1195,4.544186046511628

Following that purchase we've pre-ordered the 2nd and 3rd DVDs and now the Christmas DVD.  Our granddaughter, 16, my mother, 89 and now a brother have asked for DVD.s as gift ideas.  As much fun as it is to listen to (and sing along), these young men are even more of a joy when seen in person!  For anyone who loves harmony and being able to understand the words being sung(except for the gaelic words) you will enjoy this and the other DVDs available.",1288483200,,609,4.353982300884955

The people who got this group together had the best knowledge of what the public needed. We've been to a show that we had to drive three hours to get to the venue, this was the best show we've been to in years and we're hoping we'll see them in the coming year, as our residence is hours from any major city.

3884495,5,B002AK9UUO,"Celtic Thunder always succeeds in producing an excellent CD or DVD of their shows. This DVD has 29 wonderful songs, so it's packed with both Celtic and popular songs. George sings many manly ballads such as ""Working Man"" and my favorite get-out-of-your-seat song, ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)."" Sexy Ryan has great stage charisma and sings sultry songs such as ""Ride On,"" ""Desperado"" and ""Every Breath You Take."" Paul's pure well-trained voice resonates in ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""You Raise Me Up."" Damian is adorable in anything he sings and has the bluest eyes you've ever seen! Add Keith's voice into the mix with the other four guys and the harmony is superb in such songs as ""Take Me Home,"" ""Ireland's Call"" and ""Caledonia.""

3884520,3,B002AK9UUO,"I was disappointed in ""Take Me Home"" as opposed to the original ""Celtic Thunder"" but mostly it was because of the way they had to work the original ensemble numbers around Damian's deep voice.  The last part of ""Heartland"" was done by Ryan since they still needed a tenor and Damian did most of the solo work on ""Steal Away"" that had previously been done by Paul.  It was a shock to hear Damian as a baritone instead of a tenor, but I got used to it.

Frankly I'm glad they gave him more mature teenage numbers to do.  ""Puppy Love"" and ""Young Love"" on the previous DVD were just silly.

All in all it was pretty good, but not as good as the original.",1273536000,,650,4.168

I first bought the newest DVD to see how they liked it and they watched it every day over and over! I was surprised how much they enjoyed it and decided to get more so they would have a variety to watch. This DVD arrived quickly and in very good condition. The quality is excellent. They have watched these over and over at least 2-3 times a day for a month now and we all enjoy the music and the ""show"". The variety of types of songs is really good, not just all one kind of music. I noticed that some of the songs are repeated on the different DVDs so check out the song list if that is an issue for you. It didn't bother us because the production is different each time.

3884549,3,B002AK9UUO,"Huge huge Celtic Thunder fan here!!!!

I can't believe I'm not giving the guys 5 stars here but the quality of this DVD is just horrible!!  The fact that there are a lot of repeat songs doesn't bother me in the slightest.  It's actually kind of cool seeing them change up the songs a bit, singing them in a different venue with a different set and different costumes, plus there's a whole new dynamic with Damian's voice having changed since ""The Show.""

What I don't understand is how on earth the management team let this DVD go to print.  How not a single person realized the completely unprofessional camerawork, first of all there were far too many shots from behind (not that the boys don't have lovely backsides, but we want to see their faces!!) And certain shots actually made me dizzy!  There were far too many audience shots, and the shot of the empty stage before Keith made is entrance is just inexcusable!!!!  There also seemed to be a problem with close-up shots.  It's like the camera operators were aftraid to get too close, they didn't even zoom in on some solos!!!!  One of the things I loved best about the first DVD is how close the cameras were able to get.  It was so much more intimate being able to see the guys' facial expressions and feel their emotions, plus they're lovely to look at of course :)  Those gorgeous blue eyes on Damian and Keith, my goodness!!

Another poster had mentioned their lack of enthusiasm as well.  It's almost as if they knew the DVD production was crap so they couldn't give their best performances, their hearts just weren't in it.  Something was definitely up.  There were times when Keith couldn't even muster a smile, like the passion had been sucked out of him.  The spark was missing that we've come to know so well!!  And I understand they had been touring and they must all be exhausted, with good reason!  But having worked with perfomers, 99.9% of the time the adrenaline kicks in and they light up on stage, you'd never know they were running on empty!!  So it seems like something more than that....

Thankfully that spark certainly returned for ""It's Entertainment!""  The guys we know and love were definitely back in full force!!

So 5 stars for Celtic Thunder, definitely!!!!  But a 0 for film production.  I'm absolutely disappointed that this was allowed to be mass produced and made available to the public.  Someone along the line should have scrapped this whole thing and tried again with a new film crew.  It makes the guys look bad to perform on such a lousy DVD, so unfair to them!!

Please save yourself the stress and aggrivation and buy ""The Show"" or ""It's Entertainment!""  Those DVD's are definitely worth your money and truly show off the amazingness that is Celtic Thunder!!",1270598400,,2758,4.630927835051547

3884551,1,B002AK9UUO,"The first DVD was excellent. This DVD is terrible. Although slightly entertaining, it did not look or sound as though it were professionally done. The audio was monotone - no volume change in singing emotions. This made the entire show boring to watch. Keith has a southern drawl in his sound and really is not as ""hot"" as he thinks he is. Teeny bopper songs were OK for Damian a couple of years ago but he's a little too big for the ""Cutesy"" songs all the time, not to mention that his voice is getting too deep for it all. The follow-up DVD, ""It's Entertainment"", is a little better. It is more of a variety show setting, but the audio is still pretty much the same volume throughout.

The instrumentals overpower the vocals. The new songs are too few. I have all of their other DVDs and CDs, so I don't want to hear them sing the same songs on this one. This is not ""The best of"".

3884619,2,B002AK9UUO,"Loved the guys in the first video, but this one was MUCH lower quality. I've done a bit of video production--so I looked with a very careful eye. As I watched I kept asking myself over and over, why did they do that shot or make that transition? Didn't have any answer. Video production not very good. Then there was the audio quality. Mediocre at best. The content was mostly the same songs as on their first video.

The boys seemed flat and tired. As I understand it, they were in the middle of a tour when this was shot as a live concert. They must have been too tired and needed a break from the tour.

Finally, Damien who was the real star of their first video was about 16 when this was shot. When he matures a bit more, his voice will be amazing. When he was younger it was amazing. Right now, it isn't. A number of times his rich, now deep voice broke and crackled. No real problem on his part--that is a normal part of being 16. He may be a bit embarrassed when he gets older to listen to himself sing here. It looked as though every time he began singing, he had to pause a moment and realize that the voice he heard was actually his. Also, he like the rest of the boys was tired and listless while performing.

I understand they recently shot a new video earlier this month (October, 2009). Save your money for the release of that video, If you don't have their earlier video, get it NOW. Pass on this one.",1256256000,16,1417,4.183150183150183

I would reccommend the first dvd NOT this this one.

There are 29 songs on this 'Take Me Home' DVD, which runs 1 hour 44 minutes. There are NO special features. About ten of the songs are repeats from their first show. The audio fidelity is very good, but the video production itself lacks polish. At times it seems volunteers from the audience were given cameras because there's some unprofessional camera handling. Poor Damian must have grown nearly a foot taller since the first show, and his voice is changing (not for the better). During some songs he seems to have trouble matching the range in which the other guys are singing.

3884652,5,B002AK9UUO,"Celtic Thunder adds to their triumphal debut album with this second entry in the series. This time, they're on the road in Ontario, Canada with a live show, and a huge crowd who seem to be made up of enthusiastic Celts, judging by the Irish dancing in the aisles and the signs being waved. The most remarkable aspect of the show is the change in both voice and appearance of young Damian McGinty, now almost 17 years old, and two years removed from the debut performance in Ireland. It is a bit sad to hear his voice has deepened considerably, as he's grown into a taller young man (he's not the little boy you remember from 2007), but his voice now has a new and wonderful quality. There have been changes in singing arrangements necessitated by this: Ryan Kelly now handles some of the ""boy soprano"" parts and Mr. McGinty has taken over the lead singing on numbers such as ""Steal Away"". The addition of two instrumental numbers of the purely Celtic variety allows the showcasing of the musical talents of Neal Byrne, Barry Kerr and a very talented all-female string section, composed of what appears to be two sisters on violins, a viola player, and Megan Sherwood on Cello. They also contribute their vocal talents accompanying Damian on two of his solos. Just as in the first show from Dublin, one sees the end with a regret of not having been there. The act has not visited the American south, except for Atlanta (as far as I know), so I hope someday to see them in person. They have brought true musical joy to thousands of followers around the world, and it's hard to imagine them giving a performance that is not a sellout audience. I highly recommend them and ""Take Me Home"" is as worthy introduction if you haven't heard them before. However, don't neglect to get the first album, ""Celtic Thunder-The Show"" to hear young Damian as he will never be heard again, singing ""Come By The Hills"" and ""Bird Without Wings"" in performances you will never forget.",1252454400,,1962,4.592592592592593

I expected a whole new show with perhaps some of the songs performed on the first DVD but I found mostly old performances and not many new ones.  Out of the twenty nine songs on the DVD I believe only ten were different.  I felt as if I were looking at the first show.

3884699,3,B002AK9UUO,"There is a likely problem when you market a young lad with bands on his teeth and forget that ultimately the bands come off and the lad grows up into a guy or man.  This is what has happened with band member Damian whom we met in 'Celtic Thunder The Show' as a fresh young lad who sang 'Puppy Love.'  On the band's new DVD Damian sings, more appropriately, 'Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen,' a good choice because he has grown up, become taller and broader, lost his bands and has a much deeper voice.  Pity really.  This was the greatest revelation on this new DVD 'Take Me Home.'  Ultimately it is an enjoyable and enchanting DVD with good singing and music which is basically a Canadian version version of their first DVD but with a few extra songs such as the ever popular 'You Raise Me Up' sung by Paul and a couple of new songs well sung by George. It will be interesting to see what happens with Celtic Thunder in the future because to stay in the market they must present new material and fresh staging while at the same time keep their strong Irish background and endearing qualities.  Backed up by strong musicians the Celtic Thunder guys are attractive, individual and entertaining.  Unknown in Australia, the market down under is potentially a strong one.",1250899200,2,1264,4.541850220264317
3884700,4,B002AK9UUO,"I was disappointed when I first got the latest DVD (Take Me Home). I had hoped for more new material. When I got the CD I realized that most of the songs on the new CD are in the new show but you can't stretch one CD into a 2 hour show. So, of course, there are many songs from the first show. Unfortunately, they are not appearing in my area this tour but if they were I would certainly want them to perform some of my favorites. So I understand all that. But I do agree with a previous reviewer that the post-production work on the DVD leaves much to be desired. Why would there ever be a shot of an empty spot on the stage?
If I had to pick a favorite perfomer it would be George. He does especially well here with ""Working Man"" and ""500 Miles"". Ryan does an excellent rendition of ""Every Breath You Take"". The title song is very good - a very simple song, extremely well done.
I'd say they have gone out of their way to disprove the lip-synching. You'll notice Ryan suddenly slows the tempo during his solo bit of ""Danny Boy"" and Paul holds a note a little long near the end. When George sings his bit in ""Take Me Home"" he isn't belting it out the same as he did on the CD. I noticed all of them doing something just a little differently. The vocals had no post-production processing but are reproduced just as they were recorded.
After reflection I'm very happy with the new DVD. If the cinematography was better I would have given it 5 stars.",1250812800,,1448,4.175

He is great on the rest though and I especially liked his singing in ""Steal Away."" Ryan seems to have gotten a little thinner. And it has to much blue bacground. I really enjoyed the relaxed atmospere they have on this DVD.

3884702,2,B002AK9UUO,"First off, let me start out by saying that I LOVE, LOVE Celtic Thunder.  I'm a devoted fan.  I own their first DVD, as well as their CD, and I've practically worn both out from playing them so many times.

This DVD, however, was a big disappointment in so many ways that it's hard to even know where to begin.  For one thing, it was mostly the same material from the first DVD.  Same set, same blue lighting, same choreography, and with far too few exceptions, the same songs.

In fact, when the DVD started, and the camera began panning that stone, blue-lit set, with the same thunder sound effects, and the same voice intoning the speech about the ""sound of drums"" from Celtic Thunder's debut DVD, I actually hit the pause button so I could look at the case again.  I though I had accidentally purchased a copy of the debut DVD that I already own.

I'd have even been willing to tolerate all the repetition if there had been some great bonus material.  New interviews or profiles of the performers. Footage of their homes and families.  Candid behind-the-scenes stuff. Scenes from their tour. Anything.  But this DVD doesn't have a single bonus feature.

But, by far, the worst part of this new DVD is how tired and unenthusiastic the guys seem.  Their hearts aren't in their performances.  There's none of the spark and fire and excitement of the original. It's sorely lacking that energy that made them so appealing in their first DVD.

Ryan looks thin and haggard.  His eyes keep darting around, and he's missing his trademark intensity.

Keith seems tired and apathetic. He looks like he's done this show one time too many (or a hundred times too many). It's like watching a little boy who's being forced to stand in a wedding.

And poor Damien...he's obviously moved from childhood into young adulthood in this DVD, but he's forced to do songs that are way too young for him and for his new, deep voice.  Let the boy move on to more grown-up material!

Even the musicians seem bored, listless, and tired.

Only George and Paul seem to be having any fun, although even in them, you can sense some weariness.

The only time they all seem to be genuinely smiling and happy is at the end of the very last song.  It's like they're relieved the show is finally over!

Other complaints: Poor camera work.  Lots of times the camera was in and out of focus. Strange shots and angles. Bad editing. Very amateurish.

Hopefully, Celtic Thunder's next DVD will have new material, new sets, slicker production, and a more enthusiastic feel.  Watching this one was like eating lukewarm leftovers.

Overall, just a big disappointment.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because I love these guys, and I feel that they deserved better than this shoddy, rehashed, rushed DVD production.  It could have been done a million times better.

Bottom Line: Don't waste your money on this one.  But DO buy Celtic Thunder's debut DVD!  The original was fantastic!",1250640000,52,2965,4.640384615384615

3884729,2,B002AK9UUO,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a Celtic Thunder fan and I eagerly pre-ordered this DVD two months in advance.

  Either someone's kid put this DVD together as a school project or the Celtic Thunder organization needed a quick infusion of cash.  'Take Me Home' could not have been produced with the idea of showcasing Celtic Thunder in the best possible light, unless you think the migraine-inducing blue haze of this hastily assembled production is complimentary.  On top of the choppy transitions, strange camera angles and dreadful edits, the CT members often seem bored and tired.  Their voices are ragged in places and for the most part they lack energy and enthusiasm.  Perhaps it is because they've been singing the same numbers for nearly two years or maybe because the newer additions are poorly chosen.  George singing '500 Miles' in a tux?  Weird.  Paul doing 'You Raise Me Up'? Done to death.  And then there's Damian.  Poor Damian.  His voice has dropped into his socks and he must be six feet tall but still they dress him in sneakers with his suits like a 12-year-old altar boy and have him sing songs charting his passage through adolescence.  His past and present numbers remind us that he has fallen in love, turned 16 and broken up with his girlfriend.  Does this mean we will have to endure a cringe-worthy version of 'Tonight's the Night' on the next tour?  Perhaps the CT producers should stop trying to shoehorn Damian's image into a preconceived stage persona and just let him sing material befitting his vocal talent.  He's a handsome young man with a rich deep voice. Spare us this slightly hipper Celtic version of the Lawrence Welk Show and just let the boy belt a few ballads.

  I would have given 'Take Me Home' a higher rating if the DVD had included bonus material such as an interview, a view of backstage preparations or even a personally guided tour of the CT bus.  It would have helped me feel I'd gotten my moneys worth by giving me something I didn't already have.  Instead I got a rehashed concert video that was marketed, not because it was worth buying, but because it was considered an easy sell.",1249344000,,2141,4.668449197860962
3884730,4,B002AK9UUO,"It was interesting to see how the performers and production values have developed over time compared to the first DVD. It seems from the start that the production has mainly been designed to appeal to American audiences.
Still some ""cheesy"" numbers but overall the performers seem more relaxed. I thought that in the first DVD the guys' movements/choreography was very robotic with little chemistry or interaction between the performers. This time around this aspect is better, more spontaneity but still a way to go. They seemed to react /respond to each other better. The smart suited outfits favouring greys and black are definately better although the horrible heavy plastic macks at the beginning are still there. Damian is struggling with the songs he has been given since his voice has deepened. Hopefully they will find more suitable songs and his voice will settle. I was pleased to see that, in my opinion, one of the best songs ""Yesterdays Men"" sung by George, was in the main concert and not tacked on like in the previous DVD as a ""bonus"". I would like to see the show's song material more reflective of the show's Celtic roots rather than too much pop(which on the whole doesn't really work that well for the group), particularly if they tour the UK and Australia. DVD quality and filmed presentation as has been previously noted, was only average, with no extra features. The DVD looked as if it had been ""rushed out"" to capitalise on, or promote the US/ Canada tour. It would have been good to include a recorded tour diary or behind the scenes material.
Again however, the backing band is great and generally from a music and performance perspective it is an enjoyable experience.",1249344000,2,1697,4.835051546391752
3884731,3,B002AK9UUO,"This DVD would be great for first time buyers of Celtic Thunder, but I was let down by the poorer quality and, like many other reviewers, the massive number of repeat tracks - 17. The producers of this DVD ought to be ashamed of themselves for ripping off CT fans. I hope that future DVDs contain all new material, otherwise this will be my last purchase of CT products.",1249171200,5,370,4.3768115942028984
3884732,5,B002AK9UUO,I love this group of men. They sing a variety of genres. I missed them when they toured Canada. I hope they return soon. There is something for everyone. I bought this DVD as gifts for young and old and all have said they also love it. Two of my teenage nieces said they loved the dancing.,1249171200,,289,4.087719298245614
3884733,5,B002AK9UUO,"The music is fantastic, as is the staging and choreography and the instrumentalists and the guys themselves were spellbinding from beginning to end. I really did not get an idea of how good the whole performance was from the clips on the ThunderTube (Celtic Thunder Website).

One note, it takes awhile for Damian to get his man voice to cooperate and it shows in the first few songs, but he finds it during Steal Away. In spite of what reviewer said, his retro songs were well done. Discovered that I liked Ryan's songs more from watching the DVD than from ThunderTube. I have always loved bagpipes and Irish/Scot folk music and this just feeds my addiction, but at least Celtic Thunder is addicting in a good way.

The women playing the strings were very good instrumentally, but they wiggled weirdly. LOL

There is nothing I would change on this DVD and would recommend it highly! I am thinking about purchasing some of their earlier ones. Watching it now---ah, the kilts. :)",1248998400,,978,4.707602339181286
3884734,5,B002AK9UUO,"This is to explain some of the negative reviews people gave:

People complained about the lack of enthusiasm in the guys and the poor taping quality:

First let me defend the guys . . . this was taped at Casino Rama in Ontario Canada near the end of April - which was also one of the later concerts they did on their Spring Tour.  They were probably exhausted by this point in the Tour - not to mention they had just done a Fall Tour a few months prior.  So give them a break!  I did notice they seemed tired but now I completely understand why.
This WAS a rather poor taping compared with the first, but the first I think was more prepared for it seemed . . . (I.E. they had a large stage, an entire orchestra playing for them, etc.)  This one was just a live taping of one of their North American concerts.  I think they are working on some brand new recordings and preparing for a new DVD so this time I feel it will be more like the first.
I don't know - it all made sense to me and I had no trouble overlooking the somewhat poor taping and enjoying them.  All in all I loved the DVD.  Heck, it's Celtic Thunder and that's all that matters (to me anyway and to many fans I'm sure)!  And the two noted points (taping and tired men)didn't make me think any less of them (as one review said)!  It made me appreciate them more to know that they are willing to work this hard just to perform for us!  Looking forward to their next album! And I DO recommend the Take Me Home DVD and espcially the CD - amazing new songs included!!",1248825600,4,1528,4.090604026845638
3884735,3,B002AK9UUO,"Okay, many of the reviews here either pre-date the DVD release, or  refer just to the group themselves, not this DVD.  Which can be misleading to someone considering this purchase.  I'm going to just address the Take Me Home DVD.

The guys sound great on the DVD (unquestionably live this time 'round) and are just as cute and talented as ever, though I do have some issues with this set.  Damian needs more mature songs to go with his more mature voice, and Keith fans will be disappointed that he sings nothing new here (the only one who doesn't. And I'm not counting Castles in the Air, since it was included in the Act II cd).  The Take Me Home cd has  two new Keith songs, which for some reason don't make it into the show.  The CD may be more worth your money, as it consists of all new songs, plus a new version of Steal Away, that you do hear on the DVD. As others have said, this DVD seems to just recycle a lot of songs from the first DVD, which is disappointing.

But none of that bothers me as much as the AWFUL production value of the DVD.  It looks like someone from a college video class made it.  Crazy camera  angles, unnecessary zooms, shaky-cam to the point of vomit-cam  a couple of times. Bad lighting, strange crowd shots, and even my DVD menu didn't work. I can't do anything in the Song Selection on the main menu. It keeps looping and looping. I have to play the first song, stop, hit menu, and THEN I can select a particular song. At the end of the DVD, if I hit stop, it won't, and then after it plays out on it's own, I again get booted back to the Song Selection menu, which still won't let me select a song.  Anyone else having this problem?  It is just another example of how this DVD was shoddily made in an effort to cash in quickly on the Lad's popularity.  It is insulting to them and their fans.

So, to sum up, Celtic Thunder, the group, get 5 stars. Celtic Thunder, Take Me Home, the DVD, gets a 0.  If you are a CT fan, as I am,  you'll get this anyway (or even pre-ordered it like me, whaaa) but just be prepared that it is nowhere near as nicely done as the first one.",1248566400,118,2109,4.137592137592137

I pre ordered both the DVD and CD before they were released because we are enthralled with this group. My whole family was disappointed with the quality of this DVD--the camera angles, poor sound quality, and the editing was horrid.  I couldn't believe the things that were not edited out which made this look like the group was just suffering through a performance with a bad crowd. They even showed one guy in the audience yawning.  One member of CT made the comment,""Come on Rama, you can do better than that!"" when they were trying to involve the crowd. The guys seemed to have no energy or passion (overall).  I am surprised that someone involved with the groups image would approve the release of a DVD of this quality.",1248480000,6,866,5.4
3884757,4,B002AK9UUO,"I waited impatiently for the release of the newest DVD ""Take Me Home"" and the CD, but will admit that I think the original DVD was better.  The original DVD is more professionally done and you can see that several takes were incorporated into the final cut.  It's always fun to find the ""bloopers"".  The new DVD ""Take Me Home"" seems to be more like an actual concert with one take, therefore not quite as slick.  I would recommend for new fans of Celtic Thunder to start with the original DVD, but then you are going to want this new one for the few new songs.  I haven't been lucky enough to see them live yet, but I can this fall or next springs.  Until then I'll have to be content with my DVD, I may have to buy the original DVD again as I have almost wore mine out.  The guys are awesome and not to be missed.",1248307200,,814,4.081761006289308
3884758,3,B002AK9UUO,"I am a huge CT fan and would have bought this DVD no matter what people said but I do feel I need to add my 2 cents.  I echo what other people have said about the color and filming.  it is crazily bad!  Some shots go to one side of the stage and no one is there.  Shots are from weird angles and trail off strangely.  Not to be picky but George looks a bit heavier and it seems to slow him down considerable during 500 miles.  Obviously Zara is a bit heavier too.  Ryan looks thinner and Keith appears to be going through the motions.  Paul was never my favorite before but he looks great!  especially in his vest.  Damian does take a bit of getting used to and his voice cracked during a couple of songs.  What is with the editors of this??  I think the guys have been working too hard.  This DVD lacks the personality of the other one.  It seems to have been rushed.  I hope next time they film it in a smaller venue so there is some authentic interaction instead of what seems to be forced and choreographed.  No matter what though, I am still a Thunderhead!!",1248134400,3,1062,4.107317073170732
3884759,3,B002AK9UUO,"I haven't seen the PBS show ""Take Me Home"" but I watched the new DVD last night and was disappointed by the set and the weird lighting effects. What was with all that heavy blue light and the spot sweeps of the audience? It seemed like they wanted to make it more like a rock concert; the set and lighting for the first show's DVD was superior in every way.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the repetition of so much of the first show's music, fifteen out of twenty-nine numbers, seems excessive.

That said, the music is beautifully done and the five men's performances as fine as the first show. It's time to give Damian McGinty some more mature material. He's a young man now. And it was nice to see George Donaldson able to cut loose on 'I'm Gonna Be""",1247961600,,758,4.368794326241135
3884760,3,B002AK9UUO,"While the performance of CT is as mesmerizing as before, the new DVD (Take Me Home) includes mostly the old material already seen in the previous DVD (The Show). Only a handful of songs are new in this program, which makes me feel disappointed, having paid twice for almost the same thing. That said, the new numbers are quite good. Belfast Polka/Pennsylvania Railroad is really fun, especially the female violinists shaking their hips in their silky dresses. Working Man and Yesterday's Men are excellent songs about a worker's life. Take Me Home and Danny Boy showcase how terrific all five talents sound when combined. Damian has grown up quite a bit and his voice has been deepened, but I don't think it's a good idea for him to cover Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen and Breaking Up Is Hard To Do. It's fun for him, as a kid, to play with Puppy Love or Young Love, but at this stage I think he should get more original material such as A Bird Without Wings to match his talent instead of covering outdated mediocrities. And Paul, thanks for You Raise Me Up, which shows beneath your talent there's also a sensitive, lovable soul.",1247961600,3,1130,4.626865671641791
3884761,3,B002AK9UUO,"I enjoyed Celtic Thunder the show very much and have watched it many times. This new video is good, but contains far to many songs that were on the first video with out improving on any of them. I do not know if it is because I have heard them so many times or what, but in almost every case I prefer the other video. Damion's voice has changed, as of coarse it should,but I much prefer A BIRD WITHOUT WINGS, in the first video over this one. If you enjoyed the the show on the first video you will most likely enjoy this one, but next time I hope they have some new material.",1247875200,,576,4.017391304347826
3884762,5,B002AK9UUO,"OMG!  This is better than the first.  I was afraid I was going to be disappointed.  No way.  The performers are more confident, freer, and stronger in their presentations.  Damian is older, taller and better.  He still sounds like an angel only taller.  I hope they bring out another soon.",1247788800,,289,4.66
3884763,5,B002AK9UUO,"Back with a follow up to their first DVD ""Celtic Thunder: The Show,"" the 5 wonderful voices of Celtic Thunder have returned with another amazing performance.

The new show includes several popular songs, as well as a few Irish classics including ""Happy Birthday Sweet 16"", ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"" (Sung by Damian), and ""Every Breath You Take"" (Sung by Ryan).  Two especially breathtaking performances include ""500 Miles"" sung by George and ""You Raise Me Up"" performed by Paul in the best traditions of an Irish tenor.  New group numbers include ""Take Me Home"" and ""Working Man""

In addition to these new pieces, a few of the old ""classics"" return including ""Heartland"", ""Caledonia"", ""Danny Boy"", and ""Castles In The Air"".  The entire show is rounded out with a rousing instrumental entitled ""Appalachian Roundup"" featuring a dancing fiddler.

The entire show is more than singing, with amazing musical performances  traditional Irish instruments, such as the Highland bagpipes, bodhran, and tin flute, alongside classical instruments including piano, cello, and violin.  Particularly entertaining is the percussionist who occasionally seems to make sounds appear from thin air!

I would reccommend this DVD to any fans of Celtic music, or music lovers period.  And, while Damian has found his ""big boy"" voice that is lower than in the first DVD, it still sounds amazing and is in no way a detriment to the overall performance.

Lets just hope they can keep it coming!",1247702400,4,1471,5.112970711297071

3884776,4,B002AK9UUO,"The first Celtic Thunder DVD is my favorite live performance video, so I knew it would be hard for them to match it.  The new show - Take Me Home -has 29 songs, but unfortunately only 10 are new.  I think the song Take Me Home is awesome, and Ryan really excells on Every Breath You Take, and George's I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) is fantastic.  Their renditions of Danny Boy & You Raise Me Up are excellent, but I much prefer the way Celtic Woman does them.  Of the 19 repeats, Steal Away is different but still beautiful.  Damian is older now and his voice has deepened, but he is still amazing. The whole show seemed to be lacking the excitement of the first show, and I missed Phil Coulter & the orchestra.  This seemed like an attempt to cash-in on their popularity without offering much that's new.
