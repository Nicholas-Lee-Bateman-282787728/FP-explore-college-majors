8429431,3,B004HBJS92,I was disappointed to  find it did not have captions as I am extremely deaf.  I would give it 3 stars and  probably it is dated now in terms of the humour.  Still my husband enjoyed it.,1465516800,,185,3.918918918918919

8429434,2,B004HBJS92,"Ten minutes into No Sex Please We're British and I was restrained from stopping it only because I was determined to review it. Good British farce is funny, a wonder in timing, barely controlled chaos and just enough teasing to keep it titillating. At no time is this movie successful in on any of these points. There is however Ronnie Corbett. The short, bucked tooth, heavily bespectacled comic figure is almost a standard of British comedy all by himself. The closest parallel I can suggest is the comedic tramp of Charlie Chaplin.

A younger generation of British TV fans, and American viewers of BBC know the caricature via Penfold, the human side kick to cartoon character Danger Mouse.

Once I began to focus on the comedy of Mr. Corbett, I had some hope of surviving an otherwise weak cast going through the predictable motions supporting  a standard issue set of bits and less than clever dialogue.  On the good side there  was the role of Bertha Hunter played by Beryl Reid. Ms. Reid will be given the single best line in the movie and had she been given more, this would have been a better movie. It is possible that this may be an edited version but noting has been gained except I am grateful that it was no longer than it was. It is also possible that some of what seemed so tired was new in 1973.

There is a plot about a mistaken address resulting in a newly married minor bank official receiving daily shipments of pornography. The couple and his clerk (Corbett) will have to find way to dispose of it. Simple and obvious solutions are glibly ignored or passed up and the mayhem that ensues is occasionally funny, esp in the hands of Corbett.

I barely enjoyed parts of No Sex We're British. I cannot recommend it. The subject matter is not proper for the very young. There is no bad language and nothing in the way of offensive nudity. Unless a very few seconds of an older gentleman's bare bottom is too shocking.",1416787200,,1931,4.531609195402299

8429438,3,B004HBJS92,"Only 3 *** because a great British farce has been cut for some reason for this DVD edition by Sony. Compared to the VHS edition from the 90's, the opening scene with the American tourists in Windsor & the Park Keepers scene (with Dereck Guyler,who is still listed in the credits as being in the film)are missing. What I would like Sony to tell me is if the film was OK to release uncut for the VHS release why cut such an innocent film about for its DVD release, about 6-8 minutes are missing.
So there you have it, at the moment this is the only version available in DVD form (unless you copy a VHS version to DVD & your not suppose to do that are you?), as I live in the UK our official version is the same as this DVD release(the same cuts)so come on release an uncut version Sony, please!!!",1301616000,11,794,4.162337662337662
