8077895,5,B000ADKYO4,"Beginning in September 1964 and running until the early 1970s, The Melody Ranch Show aired Saturday evenings in Southern California on KTLA. This one-hour color show presented top country talent, elaborate sets, superb productions and directing, and excellent video and audio. The regular stars of the show were handsome and personable Billy Mize, the ever-popular veteran Johnny Bond, Joan de Ville, and Carl Cotner and The Melody Ranchers. The show was later cut down to 52 30-minute programs. At least 7 1hr DVDs were released. I've seen two so far. This was one of my favorites with a YOUNG Glen n Campbell performing 2-3 songs

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
