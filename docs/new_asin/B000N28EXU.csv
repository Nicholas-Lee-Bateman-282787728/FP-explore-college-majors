8173942,4,B000N28EXU,This DVD set is pretty good at giving a lot of detailed information regarding the origin of this form of Karate. The only downfall that I can see is that there is very little English and a lot of reading which makes it difficult to follow along with. If you are interested in learning this form it is a good place to start.,1436918400,,323,4.142857142857143

8173946,5,B000N28EXU,I bought this one along with DVD Volume 1 of the series and really enjoyed them. I take Isshin-Ryu karate which originated from goju ryu and shorin ryu so it was nice to see more about the roots of my style.,1378252800,,207,4.073170731707317
8173947,5,B000N28EXU,"As someone who has practiced martial arts off and on for over a quarter of a century, I have seen most of the videos that there are to see. I have heard of these videos for years, but only now had the ability to purchase them.  For those who are interested in traditional martial arts and especially Okinawan karate, these videos are a gold mine of information.  All aspects of karate are covered, including basics (kihon), solo forms (kata), sparring (kumite), and various types of conditioning, some of which need to be seen to be believed.  The primary demonstrators are Kiyohide Shinjo and the recently deceased Seiko Toyama of Uechi ryu, Tetsuhiro Hokama and Shigetoshi Senaha of goju ryu, and Yoshimitsu Onaga of shorin ryu, along with several others.  There is also a short section dedicated to the karate training used by the Japan Self Defense Forces at the end of Vol. 1.  These are not instructional videos, but rather demonstrations of some mid to high level aspects of the arts.  The advertising for these videos suggests that the information contained would be most useful for those practitioners second dan black belt and up, and I would agree with that.  I highly recommend these videos for anyone interested in real martial arts; my only complaint is that I wish there were more of them.",1262044800,5,1304,4.794642857142857
8173948,5,B000N28EXU,"If you truely like classical Karate, if you want a true insight to where it all came from and you want to learn about multiple styles - you just hit the gong. I have both volumes of this in VHS. I will get both in DVD.

There is some very good information and outstanding instruction from some devasting Kyoshi's & Hanshi's. The production quality shames Yamazato & Rising Sun Production Co. and eclipses Tsunami (whom I consider to be of above all the rest). You will not be wasting your money. View and enjoy",1174262400,2,510,4.425531914893617
