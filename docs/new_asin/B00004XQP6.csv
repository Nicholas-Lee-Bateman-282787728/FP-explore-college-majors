Don't be afraid to watch this video multiple times.  Practice with a partner during and after this video and take every opportunity to go social dancing.",1071014400,5,395,4.895522388059701
7926324,3,B00004XQP6,"The vocabulary of dance is the infinite possibilities of the body in space and time and (usually) with music.  It is not  words.  All I remember from the video was talkin', talkin', talkin', gabbin', chatin', BSin', jokin'.  They are a nice enough couple (a tad bland - she needs a more exciting partner) but they talk too much.
Rather than explain a simple step 10 times in intricate detail - just show me - first slow several times, then faster, then with flair, and finally with variety, style, and flourish.
Leave the words to Amazon reviewers.  Don't talk to me - dance for me, show me.  Explain a little, then dance a lot.",1059177600,3,628,4.513274336283186
7926325,5,B00004XQP6,"I was able to finally understand the swing out and circle, after taking beginning Lindy twice. I kind of was getting IT, but really didn't have the feel.  I had viewed other tapes on Lindy ........... I just did not have the feel.  Julee and Chris gave me what I felt was a personal lesson, When I go out now and Lindy I get complements from the Follows on my Lead. I just had my first Birthday Dance and reviewed the tape before hand. Some really great Follows came out and stole me from one another. Wow was I blown away!  I know that I couldn't have had two better teachers. Chris explains in such a smooth effortless non intimidating way. That I feel that I can pick up his groove. What can I learn from a video about leading when the teacher is talking to the Follows..........Well Julee found the way..... Thanks Julee, you helped me understand what a woman really looks for...................Ok not everything she wants, but if I can atleast understand what is expected on the dance floor, it's a beginning. Thanks ................Oh I Just got the new Big City Swing  Intermediate swing video and am looking forward to expanding my repertoire. ""My Lindy don't mean a thing if I can't keep the Swing! "" Hey where did the Music in the Video come from ?",969926400,17,1258,4.4803493449781655
