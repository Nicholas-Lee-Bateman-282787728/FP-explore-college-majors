I've also had an improvement in some back issues (the reason I quit running 10 years ago), to the point that I can now run again without pain.

If you do the work, this is one exercise program that has worked very well for me.",1255046400,50,403,4.0375

3652293,2,B001J65R6G,"First pilates dvd or workout that I've ever tried, the instructor talks too much and it didn't feel like much of a workout I prefer Crunch Super Slim Down. Better instructor and a moderate full body workout.",1248825600,,207,4.621621621621622
3652294,4,B001J65R6G,"I am not a daily pilates practioner, but I have over the years incorporated pilates into my workouts for several reasons-foremost, is that the moves create a long, lean group of muscles and there is nothing that I have found that has created such a strong core and flat tummy.  I find Mari's instruction thorough and she includes a modifier for those just starting out.  For those that are already familiar with Pilates, you may not like that she speaks more of the moves, and actually slows them down to show you how you are engaging the muscles (even when you are just holding your leg off the floor).  This can make the moves not seem to flow-for a beginner, the pace would be fine. As for the moves themselves they are classic pilates, the 100, the saw, the mermaid, the side kick series, the teaser, etc. One caution-I find that you really do need to modify at the beginning until you have your core strength up.  Also, you may be more limber in the afternoon/evening for moves such as the jack knife.  I have found that I am not limber enough first thing in the morning to do this where I feel I am loose enough, where in the afternoon it is not a problem.  Listen to your body and modify when necessary to get the full benefits.

The longer, classic mat program is approximately 55 minutes.  A good well paced and well instructed program with all of your Pilates favorites to help you to build that core.

The Express program is approximately 25 minutes and has many of the same exercises but with fewer repetitions and fewer exercises. I find this kind of program nice when I am pressed for time or when I want to do a mixed workout-I sometimes will do a short pilates along with a short kickboxing workout to mix things up.

One thing you can depend on from the Winsor series of dvds is good cuing, excellent instructions and practioners with good form and graceful moves.  This would be a good beginning dvd (again, start with the modifications until you build your core up.)

You will be amazed that in several weeks you will notice your stomach becoming more toned and firm, and that, my friends is a good thing :)!",1247788800,66,2127,4.453608247422681
3652295,2,B001J65R6G,"This video is great if you are new to pilates, but for everybody else it it just too much talk and too little exercise.",1241049600,14,119,4.0
3652296,4,B001J65R6G,"I like the pace of this video, just fast enough to keep you moving, but still enough time to get into correct position.  I also like that there is one person in the video demonstrating modified versions of the exercises for those of us who are just starting Pilates.  Some of the exercises I can do the more advanced versions, but some of them I cannot, and the modified versions are helpful for me.  The mat version of the video is just short of an hour long, but I find that I'm so focused on the exercises that it goes by quickly.  I always feel like I've had a good workout by the time I'm done.  However, there is also a 20 minute session included on the video for those who need a shorter session.  I highly recommend this video if you are new to Pilates.",1238803200,26,761,4.178082191780822
3652297,1,B001J65R6G,I have tried quite a few pilates DVDs before and taken a few classes.  This tape was a disappointment because there is no flow from exercise to exercise.  Mari spends so much time between each movement explaining what to do that the whole routine seems very disjointed.  I was hoping to jump into a pilates practice that transitions well and leaves you feeling like you got a workout.  This workout didn't do that.  If you've never done pilates before you might like this video as a way to get to know the postures and movements.,1238803200,11,529,4.526315789473684

3652299,4,B001J65R6G,"I own a lot of workout DVD's but there are very few that I actually use on a daily basis.  Mari's new workout DVD has lots of instruction on how to perfom each move for optimum benifits. She even has a modified version of each one!  The express workout has fewer repetitions of each move, but still provides a good workout.  The plus with this one is that it is only 25 minutes and is easy to fit in on busy mornings.  The full workout is more thorough.  I had purchased a pilates DVD before, but this one is by far easier to follow.  Plus, there is no equipment required other than a mat.  The only downside, if there is one, is that sometimes there is a little too much time spent explaining each move before beginning it.  Overall, I would definately recommend it.",1237593600,78,767,4.277777777777778

3652366,5,B001J65R6G,"I would not consider myself an expert on pilates.  This was the first DVD that I tried and it's a great challenge.  In a lot of ways I think it is for beginners, but I do find myself very challenged by some of these moves.  Sometimes there was not a good enough modification for me and I had to sit out, but I suppose that makes sense since this isn't a beginner video.  Mari is encouraging and detailed in her instructions.  She spends a lot of time in the 25 minute work out just going through the basics of breathing.  I also like that she includes in the 52 minute work out a section for the arms involving push-ups--this helps get my heart rate going a little bit.  I have noticed improvements in my core strength and balance after doing this for a month.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in exploring pilates on a basic level--and I do think it would even be worthwhile for those who are intermediate pilates enthusiasts (though since I am not one myself, I can't accurately gauge that).",1411862400,,1018,4.349206349206349

3652384,5,B001J65R6G,"Through illness, being bedridden, having many medical procedures, and treatment I gained ten dress sizes in two years.  IN one year, once I was able to exercise again, I lost it all doing Mari Winsor's Pilates DVDs.  This was my first one--an excellent guide for beginners.  While I have other DVDs now, I still use this one.  Mari has such a great personality so it never gets boring.",1390089600,12,385,4.617647058823529

3652386,5,B001J65R6G,"Mari Winsor has great pilates DVDs.  Especially for beginners and people with physical issues (ie. back problems, knee problems, etc.) because she carefully walks you through each exercise.  She has some hard core advanced work outs as well.  I especially like that I don't have to go out and buy any props.  It's just flat out exercising.",1385683200,4,339,4.894736842105263
3652387,5,B001J65R6G,"I started using Mari Winsor's Pilates VHS tapes. I then got this CD just because it was in CD format.  I do Pilates to tone my muscles ...especially the thigh and abs and waist. I also notice that my buttocks is more toned. Mari Winsor is obviously a well-trained expert in Pilates. Her tips and verbal cues are are fantastic for focusing you -- so that you maintain the correct form. This is very important as you really have to concentrate on the movement. I am over 50. I was very out of shape when I first tried these exercises, and I now feel much more comfortable in my own skin due to strengthening my core. I sit more comfortably. My posture is improved. I have a greater awareness of my entire body. I highly, highly recommend this CD. I am getting a different one just because I have been doing the same on for so long, I want to change it up a bit. The express workout is great for just getting that Pilates fix when you have a short amount of time. The longer mat workout is more comprehensive. So I give this two thumbs way up. Mari's manner is pleasant, encouraging, yet firm, and the studio, other participants, and even the background music are well done. Nothing grates on your nerves, so you use it over and over without it becoming irritating. I have taken a lot of fitness classes of all kinds over the years, and Mari Winsor is definitely the best of the best. For those reviewers who complain that this workout is boring or not intense, I would say that they are probably into sweating and panting, and really don't understand the concentration and control that go in to a Pilates workout. Using your own concentration, you can make it very challenging simply by really focusing on the muscles you are using, and doing the movements in the correct way. Mari gives good instruction to achieve the proper movements.",1369785600,9,1835,4.477611940298507

3652398,5,B001J65R6G,This is a great work out!  It can be as easy or as challenging as you want it to be.

This instructor is a bit kooky with her catch-phrases and the video appears to be more about her than about the exercises.  To be honest, the yopilates instructor at my gym is way better than this.

This DVD includes a 25 and 55 minutes workout, which in reality is 20 and 50 minutes of total workout because of her talking. This might be a good thing for those that are beginners, but for us that are in an advanced level there are sometimes that we just want to keep moving, -although this moments could be used to meditate or something, RIGHT-. She should have included a beginners section, just like the first of her series. Too much talking, but still a great workout that really delivers results.
