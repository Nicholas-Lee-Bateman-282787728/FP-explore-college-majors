5880993,5,B00E00G9AQ,"First off, anyone interested in this title should watch Blood C first before watching this movie. It takes place 6 months after the series, and it may not make a whole lot of sense at times without knowledge from the series. However, the movie can be watched without prior watching of Blood C since only a couple of characters from the series show up in the movie, therefore if you don't mind jumping right into the movie, you can do that if you wish.

Also note that Blood C is extremely violent, and is probably the most gore infested and shockingly disturbing anime in a long time, so be careful if you are not ready for it. However, this movie is not nearly as bloody as the series, ironically. Normally one would expect the TV series to be less violent since it is for television after all, but that is not the case here.

The newest entry of the Blood franchise has more in common with the first entry, Blood the Last Vampire, than the series, Blood C. The main character, Saya, was very happy and cheery for most of the Blood C series, except at the end of the series and when she is fighting when she becomes a killing machine, but note that she does not kill humans. This non-happy Saya is the one present in this movie, and it actually is the true Saya.

In this movie, Saya joins a group of hackers to take down the main villain from the series and his organization. Yes, it is a simple revenge plot for Saya, but it is a very good revenge story. Throughout the movie, the viewer gets acquainted with the new cast, particularly the character named Mana. She kind of looks like Saya from Blood C because of her cute anime look and her glasses. Speaking of the character's looks, the cast seems to take a more serious look to them opposed to the overly cute Clamp designs from the series. Actually I do like the cuter designs from the series because it was absolutely shocking when something bad happened to the cute or pretty looking Clamp designed characters, much like the anime Higurashi or Another. However, the character designs in the movie look really good even when compared to the series; after all it is a movie, so it should look good. Even the backgrounds look amazing in the movie, especially the city at night.

For anyone wondering if this movie or Blood C has anything to do with Blood Plus, it does not. The series, Blood Plus seems to be a different entity than this series; originally I thought that it could be related, but after watching the ending of Blood Plus, and then Blood C, I can only conclude that there is no connection except a girl named Saya. She even has long hair this time, opposed to short hair in Blood Plus, and I am not sure if her hair can actually grow at all.

If Blood C has proved anything, it was that they had a plethora of horribly creative monsters, and this movie does not disappoint. The movie begins with a fight against a monster on a train, much like the beginning of Blood the Last Vampire. The back cover of this product has a comment talking about the Lovecraftian monster designs, and I have to admit that they do look like monsters taken right out of a H.P. Lovecraft story, especially the final monster.

Overall, the movie is very well done, and is definitely worthwhile to those who have seen Blood C or like vampire stories. This set, much like many Funimation titles comes with both the DVD and Blue Ray discs. The special features include: the US staff commentary, promos for the movie, and a kind of funny short series that explains aspects from Blood C with chibi versions of the twins from the series.",1380931200,18,3580,4.441400304414003
5880994,5,B00E00G9AQ,"I preordered Blood-C Last Dark from rightstuf last month and received it on October 3rd, watched it on October 5th.  I must say that this is not a standalone movie and it is highly recommended that you watch Blood C the Complete Series before watching this movie or you will be completely lost.  The series, while it started out slow and with awkward pacing, climaxes to a totally unexpected height in the last several episodes and leaves you on a HUGE cliffhanger, which is where this movie picks up.  The giddy, nave, jaunty Saya from the series is now gone, and now a dark, gritty, tenebrous Saya takes her place.  Struggling with muddled memories from her past, a disgruntled Saya now cuts a bloody path with not much more than revenge in foresight.  The art is completely different from the series, with lots of CG present.  While this is usually a big turn off for me, it was actually quite pleasant and made for quite stunning and superb visuals.  I've only seen this movie and the series in English dub so far, so I cannot comment on the Japanese voice actors.  Some of the things I didn't like about the actual disk itself are a lack of any real special features, and no English subtitles, so even if one were to watch this movie in Japanese language you wouldn't be able to turn on subtitles, which was also my quandary with the series.  Only a commentary with the English voice actors and several small, comical shorts that brief the series is present.  Also the audio is quite terrible.  That being said, this movie is definitely over priced at $30.99 on amazon, so I would recommend you wait until a price drop, but if you don't mind any of that, this movie is a must see and have for fans of the series.",1380931200,3,1717,4.471153846153846
5880995,4,B00E00G9AQ,"There are several incarnations in the so-called Blood franchise. Some are good, others fair, others barely passable. The Blood-C series fell into the latter category. While everything ""Blood"" has had Saya at the core, the depictions have varied depending on the authors' take.

In the original, she was beautifully dark and brooding, twinged with a hint of sorrow around the edges. In the Blood-Plus series she was innocence that was thrust into a twisted world or death and sorrow. The live action movie tried to recapture the feel of the original Saya. While it came close, it lacked a good story or sound acting in the supporting cast (not to mention B or C grade 3D rendered creatures). With Blood-C, Clamp went in a rather odd direction. They added depth to the character but still missed the darkness of her personality until the closing minutes of the final episode.

This movie picks up where the series left off--with a dark, brooding, and troubled Saya that actually was closer to the original than any since the original film.

The opening sequence was truly heart-pounding. From the beautifully rendered background music to the classic chase scene through the streets and across the rooftops of Tokyo. Saya, sans the glasses from the series, was drawn with more feeling and depth, and her mood was what Blood fans came to love.

I'd actually have preferred this as a multi-episode series. It would have given more time for development of the new characters. With the running time of just over an hour and forty-five minutes, we get the equivalent of about six or seven episodes; barely enough time for things to heat up before coming to a close. Still, it was good to see a Saya we could enjoy for what she is; a killing machine haunted by the knowledge of what she is.

I've added this to my Blood collection and I'd recommend it for any who know the series and films that have come before it. For me, it's worthwhile if for no other reason than the opening sequence.

NOTE: I watched this with Japanese audio and English subtitles so I'm unable to comment on the quality (or lack thereof) of the English dubbing. The Japanese voice acting was very good. But then, I'd expect nothing less.",1380931200,2,2202,4.721354166666667

5881018,4,B00E00G9AQ,"It's already been summed up pretty well, but Blood-C The Last Dark is the series' sequel in plot and similar off-the-wall-like conclusion, but that's about it. It's gore factor has toned down alot, there's a 6 month gap in the timeline between the two left unexplained and even the char design is different; CLAMP seemed to focus on steering away from their tall lanky designs, something actually refreshing.

If I were to only mention one thing about The Last Dark, it is the animation. It's inconsistent but overall amazing, leaving a great taste in my mouth...what a paradox lol.

Interesting CGi incorporation in the first 20 minutes (a lot of CG), one of the best [CG] car chase scenes i've seen in anime, and fine details throughout proving care was put into the animation, even considering it droops in places; things like strands of hair falling when Saya dozes off, animated hand gestures when simple head nods (less work) are typical, ferocious hacking skills brought to life, amazingly rendered facial expressions and awesome fight sequences.

In terms of production quality, it will not disappoint. Everything else is certainly subjective, as is the entire Blood franchise.",1399593600,,1185,5.066666666666666

It's not quite up there with ""Evangelion"" in terms of mind-screw, but it is sufficiently weird/ambiguous enough as to leave this viewer going ""Huh? WTF?"" You'll see what I mean if you watch it. I'm just glad I didn't spring for the Blu-Ray version, opting to go cheap and get the ""Amazon Instant Video"" version instead. Final rating: 8/10 (points off for the weird ending).",1396915200,,475,4.666666666666667

5881028,5,B00E00G9AQ,After I had seen the series I had a feeling there would be a movie. I think it was smart of CLAMP to do a series first since they learned a bit of a lesson from Blood: the last Vampire. Though I think part of why I liked it was that I knew the series was going to go into a movie. I will try not to give away to much but it is gory and what many may consider dark.

5881032,4,B00E00G9AQ,"Most anime series these days have nothing on the amount of controversy raised by 2011's ""Blood-C."" Some have decried as a horrendously boring show with an ending that comes out of nowhere, while others have lauded its bold attempts to subvert expected norms in a modern anime series. Opinions are generally split straight down the middle, but where nobody disagrees is that the main program ends on a rather unsavory note, and an even more unsavory cliffhanger. That cliffhanger is resolved in ""Blood-C: Last Dark"", and while not every loose end is ultimately wrapped up, fans of the first part of this divisive saga will go home happy. Mostly.

Without getting into too much spoiler territory, Saya is on a quest for revenge after the surprisingly brutal events that took place during the climax of the series' final arc. Left for dead and out for blood, her travels take her to Tokyo in an attempt to take down the corporation behind the tragedy that turned her life upside-down. What she finds there is a city under an oppressive regime, with heavy restrictions based on what can be posted online, when people of a certain age can go out at night, and other punishing restrictions. This time, she is not alone in her battles, however, as she meets an underground ground of hackers and activists who plan on taking back the city. As it just so happens, their agenda lines up perfectly with her own, and together they begin to go up against an enemy who is better equipped, better funded, and all around stronger than they are.

Overall, the story is one that is infinitely more accessible than what we found in the initial series. We have a cast of characters that, while underdeveloped, are nevertheless relatable and spunky. There's a coherent narrative which is full of twists and turns, and avoids the stretches of tedium of its predecessor, which is partially due to the medium through which this story is delivered. And last, but certainly not least, we have an interesting and unconventional love story going on amidst all of this, one that acts as yet another subversion of expected norms for this type of series. Without giving too much away, the relationship that slowly blossoms between Saya and the other party is incredibly bittersweet, and although you can't help but shake the feeling that their affection for each other is doomed, the movie keeps you rooting for them until the very end.

Animation-wise, it was perhaps for the better than Production IG cut short the series and made a theatrical movie, because what's on display here is nothing short of incredible. Even by the studio's own standards, the visuals are some of the best in Japanese animation history, completely fluid and gorgeous in high-definition. The fight sequences are, of course, the real showstopper here, visceral and gory to some extreme degrees, and rendered in beautiful, precise detail. Even the CG, which is a hit-or-miss aspect of many anime productions, is incredible here, especially during the final battle, which is one of my personal favorite climaxes to any film in years. Everything here looks great, and it's definitely worth shelling out money for the Blu-Ray.

The score is also fantastic, brought to you by series composer Naoki Sato. Dramatic and sweeping, the music keeps you engaged throughout the entire picture, blending naturally into each scene. Nana Mizuki's ending song, ""Metro Baroque"", is also great, and is among one of her best singles. Speaking of Mizuki, her turn as Saya in ""Last Dark"" is truly something breathtaking, as she no longer reverts to the ""cutesy"" Saya. This allows her to bring out deeper pathos and tragedy in the character, fleshing her out into a tortured but determined heroine who will stop at nothing to get answers for why she was brutally wronged. Of course, this actress is no stranger to larger roles, but this is one of her best simply because it's unlike anything she's done before, and breaks out of her usual character types dramatically. Other cast members in the film are great, definitely, but none excel quite as much as her.

Now, despite some of these glowing praises, ""Last Dark"" is not necessarily a perfect film. While most of the loose ends of the series' narrative are tied up, there are still some lingering questions at the end of the experience, a few actually brought about the film itself. The somewhat taunting conclusion hints at a sequel that we will most likely never receive, which is honestly a bad note to wrap things up on. Another major complaint would be the bloated nature of the whole experience, which is partially due to the longer-than-most running time of 150 minutes. Some scenes feel extraneous, such as a bathhouse sequence which seems to serve no purpose other than to show some of the female characters' breasts and butts, and the movie could have benefited without them. While the running time does a bit to make the whole experience seem a bit more ""epic"", so to speak, I can't help but feel that it could benefited from some careful cutting.

""Blood-C: Last Dark"" is a bit like the series itself. It's imperfect, but ultimately, Production IG makes an admirable attempt to do something new in the increasingly stagnant anime marketplace. While there are definitely more narrative flaws and pacing issues present in the film than in the initial 12 episodes, and a cruel tease of an ending, this is definitely something that will keep fans happy, while at the same time standing on its own as a fine piece of entertainment.

5881033,3,B00E00G9AQ,"First let me say that I am one of the people who really enjoyed the Blood-C TV series. The mystery element of the show kept things interesting with a constant sense of dread and the action scenes were extremely well done. The ending of the TV series took things in a fairly unexpected direction and established one in my opinion one of the most delightfully evil anime antagonists in a while with a painful cliffhanger leading into this movie.

With all that being said I was for the most part disappointed with The Last Dark. It picked up were the series left off and showed some initial promise that ultimately went no where in the end. The production values here are a mixed bag between outstanding 2D animation and terribly jarring 3D CG that was not needed. The movie is also lacking in the action scenes that made the TV series fun to watch. Without spoiling too much, the left over characters from the series are used to almost no degree and some display character shifts that ruin what made them great in the first place. In the end I would say that if you enjoyed the series and want some closure to the remaining plot threads this movie is worth a watch but don't expect a masterpiece.

Finally it should be noted that the violence level has been drastically toned down for this film. The series was violent to an almost unbelievable degree with some scenes being genuinely hard to watch for all except the most hardened gore hounds. The movie is still definitely not a kid friendly affair but is much more subdued by comparison.",1383004800,2,1539,4.552346570397112

On her journey she crosses paths with a team of hackers who want to expose Fumito and his organization for who they really are.  Here we see that Saya is back to her quiet and cold self, a personality quite similar to the Saya of Blood: the Last Vampire.  The animation is beautiful and the fight scenes were great. I enjoyed the movie up to the ending part.  I expected a big epic final battle but instead was greeted with a rather short not so epic one. I was not too thrilled with the ending and am hoping that there is going to be a sequel movie or something. This movie did answer the questions that I had from when I watched the Blood C series but it also left me with a whole bunch of new questions.  Even though I was not too happy with the ending, this movie still deserves a high rating because everything up until that point was awesome.",1383004800,,1190,4.271111111111111

Most of the character had depth and were interesting. The twist with the two cousins was unexpected and the dark brooding tone was intriguing.
