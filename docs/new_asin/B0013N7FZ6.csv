3118222,4,B0013N7FZ6,"My first viewing of this film in 1961 left me impressed; I had just finished reading the book and marveled at how closely the fillm followed the book.  Leaving out Scarlet's other children was just fine with me.  My reason for only four stars is the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  In the book, Ashley is a tall, young, strong, and very handsome southern gentleman.  As good as an actor that Howard was, he does not even come close to fitting the description; the documentary showing how much makeup it took just to get him to look younger is revealing.  For me, he looks and acts just like the wimp he played in Of Human Bondage!  It is said that he took the role because he was promised a directorial job in the future which may or may not have occurred if he had not died in the plane that was shot down in 1943 by German aircraft.  C'est tout.  I have perused the various reviews concerning the aspect ratio.  I am old enough to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject, but I have a question.  My standard DVD (the latest before the hi def) looks quite good on a 71' widescreen TV, but the light gray sidebars are extremely disracting.  Does the new issue have the sidebars, and,  if so, are they black so as not to distract?",1103241600,,1243,4.333333333333333

3118230,5,B0013N7FZ6,"What can you say, probably as good as it will ever get for this classic from the 30's.

Of course there no comparison to this great move, Vivien Leigh IS Scarlett and never
looked hotter.  Those eyes burning with passion.  If Clark Gable didn't have that
he was nuts.!

Either way you say it, a timeless Masterpiece, and thanks to the well deserved restoration we
can get as close to seeing it in the best condition since it opened originally in 1936.  Some
say this is a racist movie.  Frankly it does reflect the southern culture that still existed in the
South in the 1930's  Get over it@!!!  This was made then, not now.  You have to look
at this story from the storyline perspective, not just some rose-tinted view.  This collectors
edition I got on a discount and its worth the 40 I paid.  Blu-ray is the way to go though, stupendous
features and the little tv Movie they did in the 70's about the making of with Tony Curtis was very good.  I'd forgotten they used to make stuff like that.  Of course the documentary about the making of was very good.  Excellent presentation.  5 stars for what a restoration box set should be.",1412985600,2,1133,4.432038834951456

3118233,2,B0013N7FZ6,"This is regarding the 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray. We know the story, so we will not dwell. Warner Bros owns (thanks to Ted Turner) most of the back catalog of MGM. Warner Bros is always the worse on Blu-Ray conversion of older movies in terms of sight + sound.  I feel my equipment is more than adequate...a 40"" VIZIO HD Flat Screen, an Oppo Blue Ray/SACD player with all current and future features and a Bose sound system to push it all through.  First of the picture....DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE SLIDES ON THIS PAGE...the picture quality looks nothing like that. I have always written off people who claim to see a ""grainy"" quality to the picture.  This is the first time on any Blu-Ray or DVD I can say it is grainy. The picture is not crystal clear and sharp as on any other Blu Ray or even a higher quality DVD that I own.  Many have complained about a yellow cast..this is more than evident.  Despite trying to adjust color, there is a strong undercurrent of yellow which permeates the entire movie disc (not noticeable on the other discs). So watching this for 2.5 hours with a strong yellow tone makes one become sallow as well. Second the sound.  I find that True HD has much less ""oomph"" than does Master Audio or even Dolby. However in this case, the audio on either True HD setting or Dolby setting is almost non-existent.  I had to crank up the Bose to almost 70 on the volume setting (on a total of 100) and it was still barely audible.  I tried another Blu-ray and Dvd on that setting and it almost blew the speakers apart...so it is the GWTW disc that is the issue. Also, at the setting you also begin to get a ""hum"", so now it is a bit listenable but you also have a ""hum"" coming through the speakers.
Warner Bros, I have found is horrible on its DVD/Blu Rays. More often than not, they place all the settings and special features options AFTER you view the DVD/Blu Ray, so it is almost impossible to program the type of ""sound"" you wish to hear, or if you want to watch any special features, you are out of luck because, again, it is listed after you watch the movie. In the GWTW 5 disc set, ALL the special features are on the separate discs...which not only look better but also sound better than the actual movie.
I am almost tempted in buying this in regular DVD to see if it is any better.  One of the all time great classic movies and Warner's has destroyed the sound and picture through inferior transfer and remastering. Such a disappointment.
Oh yeah, he leaves Scarlet at the end.",1375056000,,2513,4.352564102564102
3118234,4,B0013N7FZ6,"Only blu, will do. Real pleased here, not mint but, saved 50%+ Beautiful felt boxed set. many extras here ---Standard DVD would not have done the trick...",1374537600,2,154,4.7407407407407405

3118236,4,B0013N7FZ6,"EVERYTIME A CLOTH BOXSET OF GONE WITH THE WIND COME OUT, I GET HEADACHE ABOUT ITS ATTRATION TO DIRT AND DUST. ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW ME TIME IS CRUEL LIKE ""DUST IN THE WIND""?",1365292800,2,174,4.0
3118237,5,B0013N7FZ6,"Had to hunt this one down, but when I did buy it, I was thrilled. I was able to give it to my sister for Christmas and the smile on her face was all the thanks I needed.

One of these days, the two of us are going to sit down and watch this. I'm sure it's what our mom would've wanted.",1360281600,,285,3.596774193548387
3118238,5,B0013N7FZ6,"From the first moment when you unwrap the plastic surrounding this box set, you know you are in for a treat. The (red) velvet feel of the box in your fingers is unlike any I have experienced with any DVD or Blu-ray set before now...and why not, this movie has been considered the greatest film ever made. Does it deserve any less than the best packaging there has ever been? With its ""70th Anniversary Gone With the Wind"" in gold letters on all four sides set against the red velvet...aw, sheer ecstacy.

But then, a moment of panic...what if the interior doesn't match up to such a buildup (much the same worry the audience probably had in 1939 prior to geting to see GWTW after such a massive buildup)? But there is absolutely nothing to fear. When you open it up, you are greeted with a picture of Scarlet O'Hara on the inner lid. If upon opening the lid, had I heard the Tara theme suddenly playing (you don't), I would not have been surprised. This truly looks and feels like a beautiful treasure box.

Inside, you find a 52-page hardcover photo and production art book. While not filled with the detailed behind-the-scenes writing of the similar Wizard of Oz book, the photos and artwork will please any GWTW fan.

Next is the reproduction of the original 40-page souvenir program (there were two versions issued, one with Hattie McDaniel pictured on the backcover with the other stars and one for the South without her. This is the one with her). Unlike the repro issued with the 2005 DVD set, this program is almost the same size as the original program (this one measures approx. 7.5 x 10 inches).

After this you get several pages of David O. Selznick memos and other correspondence. Nice touch.

What's that, you want more? Okay, how about 10 5x7 color cards showing production drawings in a nice folder called ""The Art of Gone With the Wind""? How about a CD with approximately 35 minutes of music from the soundtrack?

There is a four page booklet that serves a directory of what are on the three discs in the set. Then some promotional flyers for TCM DVDs and other items. (I thought there was going to be a promotional offer for the GWTW poster but either it is missing from my set or they changed their mind about that as there is no mention anywhere on the outer listing of items about any such offer.)

Now, all that wasn't enough, we now get to the heart of the box, the very lovely (and STURDY) foldout containing the Blu-ray disc containing the movie, the Blu disc with the extras, and the double-sided DVD that has the fabulous 6-hour documentary, ""MGM: When the Lion Roars.""

The high definition print is beautiful. The work done on this really shows. The scenes may not jump out at you screaming how much it has been restored, but when you look at the sharpness, the clean clarity of the picture, you know that unless you have seen it in the theatre you have never seen it looking so good.

One weakness is in the audio. Though it has a Dolby True HD track, I found myself having to crank up the volume to be heard normally.

The movie comes with the commentary by Rudy Behlmer from the previous DVD release.

The movie is alone on the first disc. The goodies are all on the second one...

The bulk of them have been ported over from the DVD prior edition, but now we also get to enjoy the wonderful documentary, ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" and the made-for-TV drama of ""Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War."" I hadn't seen the latter since the Moviola mini-series first aired those decades ago, and I groaned inwardly as I watched the opening credits and saw who was cast in some of the most important roles (Tony Curtis as Selznick, Sharon Gless as Carole Lombard, to name two), but upon starting to view it, I found myself enjoying it for what it was. (And, happily, the video quality is far superior to that of The Dreamer of Oz, the John Ritter TV-movie in the Oz set.)

Be happy, this box set is all you could hope it would be.",1356220800,11,3958,4.480555555555555

3118242,5,B0013N7FZ6,"I grew up watching GWTW.  By the time I was three, I had a lot of the lines memorized and all the costumes.  I did not understand why all the men fell for Scarlett (even as a child I knew she could be hateful) but I liked her anyway...she is one of the strongest feminine characters I can think of -- books or film.

I had gotten annoyed at all the versions available.  Each one came with one or two ""extras"" that were not available in other versions.

Fear not, fans. This is the ultimate edition -- hands down.

I am still watching extras, but I'm through about two thirds of them.  I have read books about the filming of this movie but I am learning so much from these extras!

The movie itself...WOW.  There are so many things that I haven't noticed before simply because the picture wasn't clear enough to make it noticeable.  Mostly wonderful little details on the costumes that are just too great.  Flowers on bonnets, patterns on fabrics, richness of textures...captured gloriously.

The extras are all excellent - let yourself be transported to a time when Gable was The King of Hollywood - and when actresses were actually classy, not trashy.

First because of the transfer os the movie to the hi-definition format.
The trhee-strip technicolor film elements restoration combined with digital realignment really allows us to view the movie with a picture even better than it was when it was first screened, back in 1939. Today, they were able not only to realign the frames of the red-gren-blue elements, but to actually divide each frame in small sections and realign them individually. This was never possible before.
The result is an overall crispy detailed picture with beautiful colors.
The bonus material is abundant and covers pre-production to release of the movie, restoration, and even what seems to be a television movie about the casting for the role of Scarlett, starring Tony Curtis as David O. Selznick.
The beautiful box with velvet finishing and golden letters is  one of the items that make this gift set be even most interesting for collection.

3118259,5,B0013N7FZ6,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Gone With the Wind,"" the Oscar-winning 1939 epic from producer David O. Selznick and director Victor Fleming, succeeds brilliantly because it manages to tell a personal story against the backdrop of a massive event.  With a huge cast including Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Haviland, and Leslie Howard it remains at least one of the best movies ever made.

Extreme focus is one of the key ingredients in getting the various pieces to hum together.  A quotable screenplay and huge setpieces adorn what is really the story of Scarlett O'Hara's trial by fire.  A study in human will and vanity, Scarlett O'Hara is, in a sense, the embodiment of ambition and a fairly early sex symbol in movies.  Played by Vivien Leigh with a distinctive British accent and the ghost of a Southern drawl, the character stands as a decent representation of the cultured Southern Belle. However, Leigh's Scarlett also knocks down the stereotype, a very willful individual unafraid to pursue what she wants.  Clark Gable completely inhabits Rhett Butler, exhibiting an authenticity that cannot be merely acted.  There is a palpable sensuality and even barely repressed sexuality to Leigh and Gable's romantic scenes together.  The infamous scene that sees an intoxicated Rhett carry Scarlett up to bed belies the image of the 1930's as a squeaky-clean era for American movies, largely created by Frank Capra's output during the decade.

Leslie Howard is genuine and solid in the role of Ashley Wilkes, the son of a well-to-do friend of the O'Hara family and not altogether unwilling recipient of Scarlett's affectionate flirtations.  Engaged to marry his cousin and wise in the ways of his own heart, Ashley is an intriguing model of a good, moral man.  Olivia de Haviland is perfect as Melanie Hamilton, the gentle and unwitting foil for Scarlett's romantic designs on Ashley.

It is impossible to escape the movie's racial depictions, as a sympathetic portrayal of the South during the American Civil War.  Obviously, the black actors are not portrayed in 1939 as they would be in mainstream politically correct America in 2011.  However, I believe the character of Mammy is emblematic of the best portrayal of the black voice that the times would allow.  An emotionally strong, wise woman she is respected by both Rhett and Scarlett and is one of the bright spots of a movie that at times can be fairly bleak.  Hattie McDaniel won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance.

The Blu-Ray picture is crisp, bright and sharp.  A huge amount of extra material rounds out a very complete package.

Also starring Thomas Mitchell (""It's A Wonderful Life""), ""Gone With The Wind"" is a superbly well-crafted epic film.",1297123200,,2713,5.026845637583893

But unless I am mistaken only three hours made it to the disc  I received in my copy of the deluxe set. If you're going to give something give it or don't bother to include it at all.

3118266,5,B0013N7FZ6,"This is one of the best movies ever made. We know that. We know its history. But for years watching its strange, blurry video/DVD was just what we had grown accustomed to if we wanted to watch it. But now, blu-ray has brought us what seems to be, at least in my opinion, a miracle. The quality of this blu-ray is frankly, my dear, astounding. And I don't use that word lightly. Aside from the cheesy melodramatic score that came with the times, the sheer picture quality is so sharp it's shocking. This is on HD. It looks like it could have been made yesterday. Which in my opinion is the most amazing thing of all. This was a time before Anne Frank had even bought her diary. Think of just how long ago 1939 was... then look at the picture quality. If you're looking to buy this movie in hopes of the blu-ray being the best quality possible, then you are on the right track and it may even surprise you. It's just that good.
As for the movie, well we all know how wonderful and detailed it is.",1282003200,6,994,4.2368421052631575
3118267,4,B0013N7FZ6,"Nice set.  Comes with lots of extra printed materials worthy of the huge box and high price.  The video on the Blu-ray itself is a nice improvement over the DVD.  Not so much in terms of clarity, as the DVD did fine.  But mostly in color fidelity.
For all Warner's work before, there remained a noticeable flicker of color.  Each frame looked good, because they worked frame by frame.  But the color would darken and lighten and change slightly over the course of several frames, then back again.  Simply look at the opening scene with Scarlet's white dress out on the porch on the DVD.  Watch as the bright white changes to pink, then green, then back to white.  Very subtle, but it happens.  That effect has always disturbed me while watching a film.  I have noticed it on other Warner Brothers movies like Ben-Hur.  This is why I prefer the type of computerized restoration done by Lowry Digital (recently changed to DTS Images or something) rather than the frame by frame work Warners does.  They do an outstanding job, but don't take into account the changes from frame to frame.
Anyway, that effect is minimal here on the Blu-ray, and to see it at all, you have to watch very closely for it.  Thanks Warner Brothers!  Now I can watch the film itself rather than just seeing rainbows and storm clouds.
The sound is about as clear as it could ever be for a 70 year old film.  Good work.
I gave a 4 star rating rather than 5, because my box was broken on arrival.  One corner was torn.  So I feel compelled to point that out.  Also, I like the movie, but I don't love it.  It appeals to my wife more than to me.  So 4 stars.",1277596800,3,1627,4.338870431893688

When this movie was made in 1939 there was NO such thing as widescreen in theaters. Films were shot and released in the traditional 1.33:1 ratio, approxiately the same as a standard television screen.

The film was re-released in the late 60s transfered onto 70mm film which had a wider format. To do so the original film had to be cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wider screen left and right. Getting the proper format, as on this DVD, you actually get all the original's photographic compositions.",1270080000,17,613,4.728971962616822

Most cinemas might not have had Screens for the Cinemascope-format, but the US-Laserdisc version that I baught a long time ago in NY had the (apparently) only Letterboxed (Cinemascope) Version ever available. I never had the time watch the whole thing, but I remember, that the title ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" rolled in Cinemascope from right to left through the screen. Of course it had thick black bars to fit into a 4:3 tv-set. Since I can't find it in the loft right now I can't even tell if it was done in CLV or CAV-format and how many discs it had, but it was a must-have-collector's item version.

The movie itself is still as good now as when it was made. The restoration looks flawless and might very well be better than when it was originally shown. My 13 year old daughter even managed to sit thru all 4 hours of this movie. No mean feat, I can tell you.

3118286,5,B0013N7FZ6,"OK, now we all know that this is like the best movie ever made, right???  Good, then I don't have to go into the movie at all.  That leaves me time to discuss this new blu-ray collector's set of the best damn movie ever filmed.  Let's get started as if we're just opening this box set.

Outer box:

As soon as you get the plastic wrap off, you're going to want to rub your hands along the smooth red velvet that covers the entire box.  You'll notice the title ""Gone With the Wind"" embossed in gold foil along all four sides of the box, and the front is a recessed image from the famous burning of Atlanta scene with the words, ""Gone With the Wind"" in raised gold lettering.  Just the outer box is enough to illicit a slight gasp.

Opening the lid:

Now let's lift the hinged lid, and what's that I see???? The lid is secured to opening no greater than a 90 degree angle with two black strap that are attached to the lid and the inside of the bottom tray.  Oh! my my!!  Who's that I see??  Why fiddle dee dee, it's Scarlet O'hara herself gracing the inside lid with a beautiful photo from the set showing her sitting on a fence in a white belle gown, with Tara in the background.  Now our eyes are drawn to what is actually inside the box.

Inside the box:

We look down to see a hardcover book with a black cover showing Rhett, Scarlett, and Tara in silhouette with the sky shaded a blazing orange and red.  The book is a top notch production with glorious black and white and color photos throughout.  There are also lots of concept drawings, costumed designs, and behind-the-scenes illustrations.  Now we lifts a black ribbon on the side which lifts the book and the other extra contents out of the box.  Now we see the reproduction of the original program given out at the premiere.  Now if you have the 4-disc DVD collector's set, this is the same reproduction as enclosed there with the nice exception of being full sized. The larger size really adds to the quality of this program.  The other printed bonuses may or may not appeal to some.  What you'll find is a collection of different communiques between the filmmakers and the various production agents.  It does provide some interesting insight into the feelings about the movie as it was in production.

The Meat:

OK, now we finally get to what we bought this for in the first place.  Oh.....wait......I really did want all the previous stuff, so I guess for some this may just be the icing on the cake.  The final two items in the set are a CD sampler and the blu-ray edition of the movie.  The CD Sampler is housed in a very handsome CD case, and clocks in at a little over 30 minutes of Alex North's wonderful soundtrack for this film.  It leaves you wanting more, but it's a nice addition to the set.  Now for the final course....the movie.  The movie is on one blu-ray disc, and the picture is absolutely stunning.  I've never seen this movie look so fresh and vibrant.  Warner should get an award for their recent remastering of some classic films; Casablanca, and Wizard of Oz to name a few.  The sound here will leave you breathless.  The orchestral score at the beginning and throughout sounds better than I've ever heard it.  There is no edition that you currently own that can come close to the quality of the newly remastered high-def image and sound.  There is another blu-ray disc full of supplemental material.  I believe that all of the content from the 4-disc DVD is included here.  There may be something missing, but it appeared to be everything to me.  Even if there is something missing, you won't miss it, because there are three hours worth of new extra features that are included here for the first time.  First is a great documentary that originally aired on TCM, called ""1939: Hollywoood's Greatest Year"".  If you missed out on the original broadcast, here's your chance to see this wonderful documentary.  It truly is amazing how many classic films were released during this year.  You also get a new featurette titled, ""Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On"".  Finally, there is a made for TV movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara War"" that dramatizes the search for an actress to play Scarlett.

Finally:

As if we don't already have enough to warrant purchase, we are presented with 10 watercolor 5 x 7 cards of different production shots.  Each of these is printed on quality stock, and is worthy of being framed.

WHEW!!!!!!  OK, that's about it.  Any collector of classic films owes it to himself to get this stunningly beautiful collector's set.  The quality of everything enclosed will leave you stunned.  You definitely get your money's worth with this set.  Bravo to Warner for presenting this very important film in a way that exudes quality and class.",1264464000,10,4743,4.53066037735849

3118299,5,B0013N7FZ6,"Gone With The Wind is still the all-time biggest Hollywood hit if measured in constant dollars. It represents Hollywood at the peak of its glory with the studio system in full swing, as indicated in an included excellent documentary on all the great films that came out 1939. I have the 50th anniversary laser disc, but this 70th anniversary package surpasses it in every way in terms of content and transfer. Although there is a little grain occasionally, for the most part it is remarkably clear and vibrant for a 70 year old film. It still holds up well as one of the few timeless works that Hollywood has produced.

The package, which comes in a fancy box, includes a thin hardcover book with posters, cast and production features. There are copies of not terribly interesting memos from David O. Selznick. There is also a copy of the original 1939 premiere program, a set of watercolor set prints, a bonus CD soundtrack sampler, and a 6 hour documentary on a bonus CD- MGM: When the Lion Roars. It is labeled as a ""limited edition""  xxx of 150,000, so don't expect it to go rare any time soon.

The Extras DVD contains a goldmine of material. In addition to the 1939 documentary, there is Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On, a s dreadful and inauthentic segment from the TV movie Moviola-The Scarlett O'Hara War that doesn't belong here, and The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind. There are also reflections from Olivia de Havilland, documentaries Gable: The King Remembered and Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond. There is a documentary on the restoration process, films of premieres, trailers, foreign language samples, etc. or just about everything a fan could ever want.

THE BOOK; Considering the fact that both major characters lack much in the way of scruples, they don't have much happy time together, and they wind up going their separate ways it is miraculous that this story could wind up being one of the great romantic films of all time. Before this viewing I decided to read all 1000+ pages of the book to become familiar with the source material. What is truly surprising for a Hollywood production is how faithful it is to the book. The only major exception, apart from a few missing characters, is the fact that in the book Scarlett had a child by each of her first two husbands.

THE CAST: Audiences at the time anticipated Gable in the role of Rhett, and he is dead-on target. It is impossible to think of anyone else playing the role or the film being the success it was without him. He was so good he was taken for granted at the time and passed over for an Oscar in favor of the gooey Mr. Chips. Vivien Leigh is Scarlett to the core. Olivia de Havilland as Melanie and Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes are both equally perfect. One should also mention Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her great performance as Mammy. The cast truly makes this picture the exceptional film that it is, under Victor Fleming's smooth direction, and David O. Selznick's perfect casting and supervision of the entire film.

Today it is mind-boggling to know that most of this was filmed on a Hollywood backlot. When the camera pulls back on the scene of a vast number of Confederate wounded on an Atlanta street you know those are all real people, which today would be created digitally. All in all it is a milestone in every respect. If you care at all about movies you have to have this.",1261267200,5,3406,4.59375

Thanks Olivia De Havilland for that Interview you gave in 2004 and thanks to WB for the wonderful release!",1259625600,4,566,4.926315789473684

3118304,5,B0013N7FZ6,"I usually don't like purchasing collector's edition boxes as I don't usually care for the extra items and they are bulky to store. The boxed set of Gone With The Wind impressed me though. It is elegantly packaged in red velvet box and the extra items are awesome as well, like the David Selznick memos about choosing among Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn for the role of Rhett, the hardbound photo book and souvenir program reproduction. The price at Amazon was also almost half the regular price, so the purchase was well worth it. Best of all, I got the set yesterday on the day of release, even though I used the free-shipping option. I noticed that Amazon is now using Ontrac for delivery and the orders seem to arrive much quicker.

Now for the blu-ray itself...the transfer is simply awesome. The color correction and clarity are breathtaking. I actually noticed wrinkles on Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard's faces, which make you realize that they were actually older than the roles they played. The film is in the original 1.33 aspect ratio, which was common for movies in those days. I know some people are looking for the widescreen version, which this film was not originally shot in. If you have a good HDTV, the solution is simple by viewing using wide zoom to fill the screen. You lose part of the top and bottom details, but there's usually not much there. I do mind when they crop the sides to make widescreen fit regular screens (pan & scan) as you lose lots of details on the sides. However, if you want to see this movie in its original glory with all the details, then watch it in the original aspect ratio. I also like that the whole movie is in one disc for continuous viewing without having to change discs. You know how long it sometimes takes to load a blu-ray disc, but this one loads fast as they don't have the elaborate menus to slow it down.

There are many extras on the second disc and the only one I viewed so far was the restoration process, which is always fascinating to me because of the age of the movie.

Overall, this collection is well worth the purchase. I just wonder what they will come up next for the 75th anniversary. Maybe by that time HDTV's can display at 8000p and we'll end up seeing more details than available now.",1258502400,10,2276,4.492753623188406
3118305,5,B0013N7FZ6,"As with the ""Wizard of OZ"" BD set, the GWTW set is elaborated -- and made ""spendier"" -- with the addition of material that might not be absolutely necessary for one's enjoyment. The box is covered in red velvet flocking (green would have been more appropriate and amusing -- qv, Carol Burnett's classic sketch). There's a CD ""sampler"" of Max Steiner's score, running a measly 45 minutes. Given that Max took excessive scoring to the max (Bette Davis had some pointedly unkind things to say about it), a ""sampler"" could have filled two CDs, and still not have exhausted the music (though the music might exhaust you). *

As with ""OZ"", there's a 52-page hard-backed book that's largely content-free, plus reproductions of some of the watercolor set-design paintings (in their own little envelope), and various memoranda sent to and from David O. Selznick. I was expecting a reproduction of Gerald O'Hara's pocket watch, but it likely would have been of even poorer quality than the kiddie watch in the ""OZ"" box.

The best bonus is a reproduction of the 25-cent (expensive in 1939) souvenir booklet. It includes pieces by the principals, notably one from Clark Gable lying about how badly he wanted to play Rhett Butler and how much he enjoyed every minute of making the film. (He didn't want to appear in ""costume"" films (having had bad luck in a film about Irish revolutionaries), was afraid to take on a role the public had such definite ideas about, and got along poorly with the first director, George Cukor.)

As I write this, I haven't viewed all the supplemental material on the second disk. (There's a lot.) The third disk duplicates the ""When the Lion Roars"" feature included in the ""OZ"" box -- though the package labeling suggests it's unique to GWTW.

GWTW was always unsharp and muddy-looking -- until the Ultra Resolution transfer of the original three-strip negatives a few years ago. It was a major improvement, and the DVDs showed the film as it had never been seen.

This edition apparently uses a new Ultra Resolution transfer, at twice the resolution (8k versus 4k) of the previous. Some scenes -- such as Ashley escorting Melanie to the balcony of Twin Oaks -- are breathtaking, far superior to what the DVD offered (and /that/ wasn't exactly chopped liver). The best Technicolor films, properly transferred, push HD to its limit.

What most surprised me, though, was the awareness of how the film's color balance is adjusted to produce specific effects. Many scenes have an appropriately warm, ""burnished"" coloration that /does not/ carry over to the scene's subtle colors. For example, at the fund-raising bazaar, there's a bottle of pastel-colored candies (which you'll probably never notice in the SD edition) that retain their correct colors, ""unromantized"" by the rest of the image's warmth. Similarly, in the scene outside the hospital where Belle Watling makes a donation, her costume is vividly colored (there's no question about her profession!), even though everything else is drab.

Several sequences are outstanding, particularly the one where Scarlett returns to Aunt Pittypat's home to tend to Melanie. It's a model of Technicolor photography, one that any cinematographer would be proud of -- as good as anything being done today. In earlier transfers of poorer prints, this sequence is flat and two-dimensional. You can't see how magnificently lit and photographed it is.

At its best, the Technicolor resembles large-format, ultra-sharp Polacolor. That's a compliment! If you're fortunate enough to have a large display, you'll gasp at some of the images.

One of the most-startling moments occurs when Scarlett goes to the train station to look for Dr Meade, one of the most-famous scenes in movie history. Hundreds, if not thousands of injured men lie on the ground, waiting for medical attention that will likely never come. There weren't enough extras, so dummies were used. And for the first time, you can actually /see/ which of the ""extras"" are dummies! You can probably tell better than the camera operator!

In short... The BD edition is a major improvement over the excellent DVD edition. It gives the impression that the movie makers were able to manipulate Technicolor to get specific aesthetic effects. ** And it shows just how /beautifully photographed/ this film is, something even the original Technicolor prints never fully revealed. The DVD probably captured most of this (I no longer have it for comparison), but you'll never see it in standard definition on a ""small"" screen. Looking at excerpts in the supplmentary material /not/ taken from the Ultra Resolution transfer is a reminder of just how ""messy""-looking the original GWTW was. It no longer is. I've never enjoyed watching it so much.

It's becoming apparent that an HD transfer, shown on a big display, is not the best way to watch a movie at home, but the best way to watch a movie, period.

The sound is so-so, of limited range and not particularly clean. (Disney does a better job cleaning up the audio of its classic films.) The reviewer who said it filled the room as well as any modern soundtrack must own Bose 901s. It would sound better in a theater, with big horn speakers that started rolling off above 5kHz. If GWTW was recorded in RCA multi-track, the stems don't appear to have survived. (Those for ""OZ"" exist and have been used, though not, apparently in the Blu-ray.) Music and dialog are mono throughout, but individual sound effects (particulary explosions) are panned to the side or rear when appropriate. The music sometimes seems too loud for the dialog, and the overall level is by far the lowest of any Blu-ray I've yet auditioned. I had to really crank up the volume, far, far beyond 11.

This is an expensive set, but it represents such a significant improvement over the last DVD edition (as good as it was) that it's worth seriously considering. Even if your BD player has a good scaler, the DVD won't look anywhere nearly this good on your HD monitor. Highly recommended.

PS: Just because a film is a classic doesn't mean it's suitable for everyone in your family. The G rating is ridiculous. GWTW is at least PG, containing, as it does, women of questionable virtue, a fair amount of violence (including a scene in which Scarlett is attacked, and another in which she shoots a Yankee, practically blowing off his face), and Rhett dragging Scarlett up the stairs to ""molest"" her. The MPAA ratings board is nothing if not inconsistent.

PPS: Though Vivian Leigh and Hattie McDaniel received Oscars, I consider Butterfly McQueen's performance as Prissy the best in the film. Though she hated the role (it's too easy to interpret Prissy as representing slaves in general, rather than one in particular), she showed great courage in taking it, and delivers a finely nuanced performance.

* Max Steiner wrote the first great film score for a talky - ""King Kong"". It epitomizes his style -- ""Mickey-Mousing"" almost every screen action, and the heavy use of Leitmotivs for characters and events. (Note how Melanie's motive appears every time she does, and how Rhett's is played -- breaking the scene's mood -- when he leaves Scarlett for the last time.) He was also the first sound-film composer to underscore almost the entire length of a film -- this is not a recent development. It's worth noting that GWTW, despite some memorable music, did not win ""Best Score"" for 1939 -- Herbert Stothart's for ""Wizard of OZ"" did. I find Stothart's score considerably more imaginative and appealing.

** The Technicolor print uses dye transfer, in which each color is layed down separately from its own gelatin matrix. This allows a great deal of flexibility in controlling the contrast and color balance -- if you're willing to put out the time and money. According to the supplementary material, the color balance /was/ adjusted on scene-by-scene basis for GWTW, just as it is for modern films -- that's what the ""color timer"" person does. A high-quality print from 1939 was found, and guided the restorers in adjusting color balance.",1258416000,373,8063,4.943131462333826

  The extras are a huge treat to any fan of the film. The magnificent ""M.G.M. When the Lion Roared"" documentary is superlative, as is the ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"". There are hours and hours of enjoyment for any fan of the movies of a long gone era.
  What a treat too to discover the old T.V. film, ""Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War.""  In my estimation one of the few great films about the history of Hollywood ever made.

3118310,4,B0013N7FZ6,"You know the drill: Scarlett ignores Rhett and pursues Melanie's husband Ashley while Atlanta burns down around her.  My two cents worth: The portrayal of the Civil War and the aftermath were superb, especially for the 1930's. Costuming and set design were also very impressive, especially in the restored version. The colors were vivid, and the people were all ideally cast for their parts. I just couldn't stand anybody in the movie. Scarlett was a jealous, spoiled brat, the stereotypical ""evil sorority chick"" type. Rhett came off better, even though he had a wicked temper; he should have left sooner, or better yet, never married her in the first place. Melanie was ""good"", to the point where people took advantage of her. And Ashley... was he supposed to be good looking back then, or what? Because he didn't seem to have much going on in the personality department. Mammy was the only one who had any sense, and nobody listened to her.  Recommendations: Oh, I don't know. Casablanca?

After an hour, I felt like I had seen two hours. And the film keeps this up for four hours. There is much that this film can teach film school undergrads.

The setting, however, is a double-edged sword. As the title-card indicates, this film s a glamorization of the Antebellum South. So we get the Code of Honor, dignity, propriety, Southern Hospitality, and all the good things of a refined society. But we also get the slave stereotypes. They are both laughable and sad. However, if you pay close attention, the slaves/freedmen are some the most noble characters in the story. Mammie has the best head on her shoulders.

This film's weakest point is characterization. Rhett is both a Han Solo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Han-Solo-Adventures-Classic-Star-Wars/dp/0345394429/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Han Solo Adventures (Classic Star Wars)</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/6305736650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>&nbsp;Rick character, a cultured Wolverine who lives by his own code of ethics, but also can be a good person if need be.

For her part, Scarelett is an abomination. For the first half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting tease. In the second half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting gold-digger. She focuses on being the center of attention at parties, complains that her widow's garb makes her look unfashionable, and stops childbearing because it adds two inches on to her waist.

""As for my people, children are their oppressors.""

Her greatest folly is her view of love and romance. She loves A, and never comes to terms that she cannot have a married man (Rhett's comment about Ashley's double-standard of fidelity is well-placed), so she marries B out of spite. As a war-widow, she puts off C's advances (Rhett), and marries D, for his money and business. A widow again, she finally marries C (Rhett), who, to his credit, gives up his blockade-ruining and settles down to domestic bliss. But she still pines away for A. Got it?

Rhett suggests that they divorce, so she can have the love she really desires, but Scarlett declines, citing the scandal.

But she admits she still loves A, and when his wife dies, Rhett feels threatened, so she changes her mind again, and wants to stay with Rhett.

Like Kevin Federline (Mr. Britney Spears #2,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playing-with-Fire/dp/B000IU3YLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playing with Fire</a>), Rhett has the better head on his shoulders and leaves. We wish he had left Scarlett sooner.

Scarlett does have redeemable characteristics. She delivers a baby in burning Atlanta, holds her family together during Reconstruction--becoming a surrogate mother to her younger sisters and addled father. She has spunk and grit, but these emerge in survival or selfish situations. But when it comes to love, marriage, and motherhood, she remains forever a pouty fourteen-year-old.

(And people think Robotech's Minmei is bad! Sheesh!)

We focus on that one famous word at the end of the movie, but there are other problem areas. There are a lot of underwear scenes--the laughable old-fashioned bloomers, but it did began a trend.

Then there is the Up The Staircase scene. Um, as they depicted it, Scarlett seemed to enjoy it. What type of message are sending to women???

And what message are we sending to women about romance and love? Scarlett's one motivation is her love--puppy-love, really--for Ashley. In this aspect, she is as monomaniacally obsessed as Captain Ahab. She is not a person, just an unmet need.

Also, there is a more insidious message--the importance of dealing with life's harsh, but empowering realities. She had three husbands, but that was not enough. Like King David, she coveted the poor person's lambling. She never accepts this empowering reality, and so she never grew up. She spent her days discontented and mopey.

The ending is appropriate. Rhett reads the handwriting on the wall, and packs up. Scarlett, the perpetual fickle teenager, pleas ""If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?""

This is a perversion of Ruth's plea to Naomi: ""Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.""

I think this highlights the inverted ethics of this film. The film is beautiful to watch and well executed, but the ethical framework is an eyesore.",1252454400,5,6519,6.361268403171008

In the book, Ashley is a tall, young, strong, and very handsome southern gentleman.  As good as an actor that Howard was, he does not even come close to fitting the description; the documentary showing how much makeup it took just to get him to look younger is revealing.  For me, he looks and acts just like the wimp he played in Of Human Bondage!

edition I got on a discount and its worth the 40 I paid.  Blu-ray is the way to go though, stupendous
features and the little tv Movie they did in the 70's about the making of with Tony Curtis was very good.  I'd forgotten they used to make stuff like that.  Of course the documentary about the making of was very good.  Excellent presentation.  5 stars for what a restoration box set should be.",1412985600,2,1133,4.432038834951456

3352730,2,B0013N7FZ6,"This is regarding the 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray. We know the story, so we will not dwell. Warner Bros owns (thanks to Ted Turner) most of the back catalog of MGM. Warner Bros is always the worse on Blu-Ray conversion of older movies in terms of sight + sound.  I feel my equipment is more than adequate...a 40"" VIZIO HD Flat Screen, an Oppo Blue Ray/SACD player with all current and future features and a Bose sound system to push it all through.  First of the picture....DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE SLIDES ON THIS PAGE...the picture quality looks nothing like that. I have always written off people who claim to see a ""grainy"" quality to the picture.  This is the first time on any Blu-Ray or DVD I can say it is grainy. The picture is not crystal clear and sharp as on any other Blu Ray or even a higher quality DVD that I own.  Many have complained about a yellow cast..this is more than evident.  Despite trying to adjust color, there is a strong undercurrent of yellow which permeates the entire movie disc (not noticeable on the other discs). So watching this for 2.5 hours with a strong yellow tone makes one become sallow as well. Second the sound.  I find that True HD has much less ""oomph"" than does Master Audio or even Dolby. However in this case, the audio on either True HD setting or Dolby setting is almost non-existent.  I had to crank up the Bose to almost 70 on the volume setting (on a total of 100) and it was still barely audible.  I tried another Blu-ray and Dvd on that setting and it almost blew the speakers apart...so it is the GWTW disc that is the issue. Also, at the setting you also begin to get a ""hum"", so now it is a bit listenable but you also have a ""hum"" coming through the speakers.
Warner Bros, I have found is horrible on its DVD/Blu Rays. More often than not, they place all the settings and special features options AFTER you view the DVD/Blu Ray, so it is almost impossible to program the type of ""sound"" you wish to hear, or if you want to watch any special features, you are out of luck because, again, it is listed after you watch the movie. In the GWTW 5 disc set, ALL the special features are on the separate discs...which not only look better but also sound better than the actual movie.
I am almost tempted in buying this in regular DVD to see if it is any better.  One of the all time great classic movies and Warner's has destroyed the sound and picture through inferior transfer and remastering. Such a disappointment.
Oh yeah, he leaves Scarlet at the end.",1375056000,,2513,4.352564102564102

3352734,5,B0013N7FZ6,"Had to hunt this one down, but when I did buy it, I was thrilled. I was able to give it to my sister for Christmas and the smile on her face was all the thanks I needed.

One of these days, the two of us are going to sit down and watch this. I'm sure it's what our mom would've wanted.",1360281600,,285,3.596774193548387
3352735,5,B0013N7FZ6,"From the first moment when you unwrap the plastic surrounding this box set, you know you are in for a treat. The (red) velvet feel of the box in your fingers is unlike any I have experienced with any DVD or Blu-ray set before now...and why not, this movie has been considered the greatest film ever made. Does it deserve any less than the best packaging there has ever been? With its ""70th Anniversary Gone With the Wind"" in gold letters on all four sides set against the red velvet...aw, sheer ecstacy.

But then, a moment of panic...what if the interior doesn't match up to such a buildup (much the same worry the audience probably had in 1939 prior to geting to see GWTW after such a massive buildup)? But there is absolutely nothing to fear. When you open it up, you are greeted with a picture of Scarlet O'Hara on the inner lid. If upon opening the lid, had I heard the Tara theme suddenly playing (you don't), I would not have been surprised. This truly looks and feels like a beautiful treasure box.

Inside, you find a 52-page hardcover photo and production art book. While not filled with the detailed behind-the-scenes writing of the similar Wizard of Oz book, the photos and artwork will please any GWTW fan.

Next is the reproduction of the original 40-page souvenir program (there were two versions issued, one with Hattie McDaniel pictured on the backcover with the other stars and one for the South without her. This is the one with her). Unlike the repro issued with the 2005 DVD set, this program is almost the same size as the original program (this one measures approx. 7.5 x 10 inches).

After this you get several pages of David O. Selznick memos and other correspondence. Nice touch.

What's that, you want more? Okay, how about 10 5x7 color cards showing production drawings in a nice folder called ""The Art of Gone With the Wind""? How about a CD with approximately 35 minutes of music from the soundtrack?

There is a four page booklet that serves a directory of what are on the three discs in the set. Then some promotional flyers for TCM DVDs and other items. (I thought there was going to be a promotional offer for the GWTW poster but either it is missing from my set or they changed their mind about that as there is no mention anywhere on the outer listing of items about any such offer.)

Now, all that wasn't enough, we now get to the heart of the box, the very lovely (and STURDY) foldout containing the Blu-ray disc containing the movie, the Blu disc with the extras, and the double-sided DVD that has the fabulous 6-hour documentary, ""MGM: When the Lion Roars.""

The high definition print is beautiful. The work done on this really shows. The scenes may not jump out at you screaming how much it has been restored, but when you look at the sharpness, the clean clarity of the picture, you know that unless you have seen it in the theatre you have never seen it looking so good.

One weakness is in the audio. Though it has a Dolby True HD track, I found myself having to crank up the volume to be heard normally.

The movie comes with the commentary by Rudy Behlmer from the previous DVD release.

The movie is alone on the first disc. The goodies are all on the second one...

The bulk of them have been ported over from the DVD prior edition, but now we also get to enjoy the wonderful documentary, ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" and the made-for-TV drama of ""Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War."" I hadn't seen the latter since the Moviola mini-series first aired those decades ago, and I groaned inwardly as I watched the opening credits and saw who was cast in some of the most important roles (Tony Curtis as Selznick, Sharon Gless as Carole Lombard, to name two), but upon starting to view it, I found myself enjoying it for what it was. (And, happily, the video quality is far superior to that of The Dreamer of Oz, the John Ritter TV-movie in the Oz set.)

I am still watching extras, but I'm through about two thirds of them.  I have read books about the filming of this movie but I am learning so much from these extras!

The movie itself...WOW.  There are so many things that I haven't noticed before simply because the picture wasn't clear enough to make it noticeable.

Today, they were able not only to realign the frames of the red-gren-blue elements, but to actually divide each frame in small sections and realign them individually. This was never possible before.
The result is an overall crispy detailed picture with beautiful colors.

3352756,5,B0013N7FZ6,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Gone With the Wind,"" the Oscar-winning 1939 epic from producer David O. Selznick and director Victor Fleming, succeeds brilliantly because it manages to tell a personal story against the backdrop of a massive event.  With a huge cast including Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Haviland, and Leslie Howard it remains at least one of the best movies ever made.

Extreme focus is one of the key ingredients in getting the various pieces to hum together.  A quotable screenplay and huge setpieces adorn what is really the story of Scarlett O'Hara's trial by fire.  A study in human will and vanity, Scarlett O'Hara is, in a sense, the embodiment of ambition and a fairly early sex symbol in movies.  Played by Vivien Leigh with a distinctive British accent and the ghost of a Southern drawl, the character stands as a decent representation of the cultured Southern Belle. However, Leigh's Scarlett also knocks down the stereotype, a very willful individual unafraid to pursue what she wants.  Clark Gable completely inhabits Rhett Butler, exhibiting an authenticity that cannot be merely acted.  There is a palpable sensuality and even barely repressed sexuality to Leigh and Gable's romantic scenes together.  The infamous scene that sees an intoxicated Rhett carry Scarlett up to bed belies the image of the 1930's as a squeaky-clean era for American movies, largely created by Frank Capra's output during the decade.

Leslie Howard is genuine and solid in the role of Ashley Wilkes, the son of a well-to-do friend of the O'Hara family and not altogether unwilling recipient of Scarlett's affectionate flirtations.  Engaged to marry his cousin and wise in the ways of his own heart, Ashley is an intriguing model of a good, moral man.  Olivia de Haviland is perfect as Melanie Hamilton, the gentle and unwitting foil for Scarlett's romantic designs on Ashley.

It is impossible to escape the movie's racial depictions, as a sympathetic portrayal of the South during the American Civil War.  Obviously, the black actors are not portrayed in 1939 as they would be in mainstream politically correct America in 2011.  However, I believe the character of Mammy is emblematic of the best portrayal of the black voice that the times would allow.  An emotionally strong, wise woman she is respected by both Rhett and Scarlett and is one of the bright spots of a movie that at times can be fairly bleak.  Hattie McDaniel won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance.

The Blu-Ray picture is crisp, bright and sharp.  A huge amount of extra material rounds out a very complete package.

Also starring Thomas Mitchell (""It's A Wonderful Life""), ""Gone With The Wind"" is a superbly well-crafted epic film.",1297123200,,2713,5.026845637583893

But for years watching its strange, blurry video/DVD was just what we had grown accustomed to if we wanted to watch it. But now, blu-ray has brought us what seems to be, at least in my opinion, a miracle. The quality of this blu-ray is frankly, my dear, astounding. And I don't use that word lightly. Aside from the cheesy melodramatic score that came with the times, the sheer picture quality is so sharp it's shocking. This is on HD. It looks like it could have been made yesterday. Which in my opinion is the most amazing thing of all. This was a time before Anne Frank had even bought her diary. Think of just how long ago 1939 was... then look at the picture quality. If you're looking to buy this movie in hopes of the blu-ray being the best quality possible, then you are on the right track and it may even surprise you. It's just that good.

3352764,4,B0013N7FZ6,"Nice set.  Comes with lots of extra printed materials worthy of the huge box and high price.  The video on the Blu-ray itself is a nice improvement over the DVD.  Not so much in terms of clarity, as the DVD did fine.  But mostly in color fidelity.
For all Warner's work before, there remained a noticeable flicker of color.  Each frame looked good, because they worked frame by frame.  But the color would darken and lighten and change slightly over the course of several frames, then back again.  Simply look at the opening scene with Scarlet's white dress out on the porch on the DVD.  Watch as the bright white changes to pink, then green, then back to white.  Very subtle, but it happens.  That effect has always disturbed me while watching a film.  I have noticed it on other Warner Brothers movies like Ben-Hur.  This is why I prefer the type of computerized restoration done by Lowry Digital (recently changed to DTS Images or something) rather than the frame by frame work Warners does.  They do an outstanding job, but don't take into account the changes from frame to frame.
Anyway, that effect is minimal here on the Blu-ray, and to see it at all, you have to watch very closely for it.  Thanks Warner Brothers!  Now I can watch the film itself rather than just seeing rainbows and storm clouds.
The sound is about as clear as it could ever be for a 70 year old film.  Good work.
I gave a 4 star rating rather than 5, because my box was broken on arrival.  One corner was torn.  So I feel compelled to point that out.  Also, I like the movie, but I don't love it.  It appeals to my wife more than to me.  So 4 stars.",1277596800,3,1627,4.338870431893688

The film was re-released in the late 60s transfered onto 70mm film which had a wider format. To do so the original film had to be cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wider screen left and right. Getting the proper format, as on this DVD, you actually get all the original's photographic compositions.",1270080000,17,613,4.728971962616822
3352767,3,B0013N7FZ6,"Reading the comments about the missing Widescreen (Cinemascope) format I wonder what the silly talk about the 4:3-format-version is coming from. Most cinemas might not have had Screens for the Cinemascope-format, but the US-Laserdisc version that I baught a long time ago in NY had the (apparently) only Letterboxed (Cinemascope) Version ever available. I never had the time watch the whole thing, but I remember, that the title ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" rolled in Cinemascope from right to left through the screen. Of course it had thick black bars to fit into a 4:3 tv-set. Since I can't find it in the loft right now I can't even tell if it was done in CLV or CAV-format and how many discs it had, but it was a must-have-collector's item version. Since then I am waiting for this version on DVD or now rather Blu-Ray.",1269907200,2,815,4.666666666666667

The movie itself is still as good now as when it was made. The restoration looks flawless and might very well be better than when it was originally shown. My 13 year old daughter even managed to sit thru all 4 hours of this movie. No mean feat, I can tell you.

3352783,5,B0013N7FZ6,"OK, now we all know that this is like the best movie ever made, right???  Good, then I don't have to go into the movie at all.  That leaves me time to discuss this new blu-ray collector's set of the best damn movie ever filmed.  Let's get started as if we're just opening this box set.

Outer box:

As soon as you get the plastic wrap off, you're going to want to rub your hands along the smooth red velvet that covers the entire box.  You'll notice the title ""Gone With the Wind"" embossed in gold foil along all four sides of the box, and the front is a recessed image from the famous burning of Atlanta scene with the words, ""Gone With the Wind"" in raised gold lettering.  Just the outer box is enough to illicit a slight gasp.

Opening the lid:

Now let's lift the hinged lid, and what's that I see???? The lid is secured to opening no greater than a 90 degree angle with two black strap that are attached to the lid and the inside of the bottom tray.  Oh! my my!!  Who's that I see??  Why fiddle dee dee, it's Scarlet O'hara herself gracing the inside lid with a beautiful photo from the set showing her sitting on a fence in a white belle gown, with Tara in the background.  Now our eyes are drawn to what is actually inside the box.

Inside the box:

We look down to see a hardcover book with a black cover showing Rhett, Scarlett, and Tara in silhouette with the sky shaded a blazing orange and red.  The book is a top notch production with glorious black and white and color photos throughout.  There are also lots of concept drawings, costumed designs, and behind-the-scenes illustrations.  Now we lifts a black ribbon on the side which lifts the book and the other extra contents out of the box.  Now we see the reproduction of the original program given out at the premiere.  Now if you have the 4-disc DVD collector's set, this is the same reproduction as enclosed there with the nice exception of being full sized. The larger size really adds to the quality of this program.  The other printed bonuses may or may not appeal to some.  What you'll find is a collection of different communiques between the filmmakers and the various production agents.  It does provide some interesting insight into the feelings about the movie as it was in production.

The Meat:

OK, now we finally get to what we bought this for in the first place.  Oh.....wait......I really did want all the previous stuff, so I guess for some this may just be the icing on the cake.  The final two items in the set are a CD sampler and the blu-ray edition of the movie.  The CD Sampler is housed in a very handsome CD case, and clocks in at a little over 30 minutes of Alex North's wonderful soundtrack for this film.  It leaves you wanting more, but it's a nice addition to the set.  Now for the final course....the movie.  The movie is on one blu-ray disc, and the picture is absolutely stunning.  I've never seen this movie look so fresh and vibrant.  Warner should get an award for their recent remastering of some classic films; Casablanca, and Wizard of Oz to name a few.  The sound here will leave you breathless.  The orchestral score at the beginning and throughout sounds better than I've ever heard it.  There is no edition that you currently own that can come close to the quality of the newly remastered high-def image and sound.  There is another blu-ray disc full of supplemental material.  I believe that all of the content from the 4-disc DVD is included here.  There may be something missing, but it appeared to be everything to me.  Even if there is something missing, you won't miss it, because there are three hours worth of new extra features that are included here for the first time.  First is a great documentary that originally aired on TCM, called ""1939: Hollywoood's Greatest Year"".  If you missed out on the original broadcast, here's your chance to see this wonderful documentary.  It truly is amazing how many classic films were released during this year.  You also get a new featurette titled, ""Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On"".  Finally, there is a made for TV movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara War"" that dramatizes the search for an actress to play Scarlett.

Finally:

As if we don't already have enough to warrant purchase, we are presented with 10 watercolor 5 x 7 cards of different production shots.  Each of these is printed on quality stock, and is worthy of being framed.

WHEW!!!!!!  OK, that's about it.  Any collector of classic films owes it to himself to get this stunningly beautiful collector's set.  The quality of everything enclosed will leave you stunned.  You definitely get your money's worth with this set.  Bravo to Warner for presenting this very important film in a way that exudes quality and class.",1264464000,10,4743,4.53066037735849

3352796,5,B0013N7FZ6,"Gone With The Wind is still the all-time biggest Hollywood hit if measured in constant dollars. It represents Hollywood at the peak of its glory with the studio system in full swing, as indicated in an included excellent documentary on all the great films that came out 1939. I have the 50th anniversary laser disc, but this 70th anniversary package surpasses it in every way in terms of content and transfer. Although there is a little grain occasionally, for the most part it is remarkably clear and vibrant for a 70 year old film. It still holds up well as one of the few timeless works that Hollywood has produced.

The package, which comes in a fancy box, includes a thin hardcover book with posters, cast and production features. There are copies of not terribly interesting memos from David O. Selznick. There is also a copy of the original 1939 premiere program, a set of watercolor set prints, a bonus CD soundtrack sampler, and a 6 hour documentary on a bonus CD- MGM: When the Lion Roars. It is labeled as a ""limited edition""  xxx of 150,000, so don't expect it to go rare any time soon.

The Extras DVD contains a goldmine of material. In addition to the 1939 documentary, there is Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On, a s dreadful and inauthentic segment from the TV movie Moviola-The Scarlett O'Hara War that doesn't belong here, and The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind. There are also reflections from Olivia de Havilland, documentaries Gable: The King Remembered and Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond. There is a documentary on the restoration process, films of premieres, trailers, foreign language samples, etc. or just about everything a fan could ever want.

THE BOOK; Considering the fact that both major characters lack much in the way of scruples, they don't have much happy time together, and they wind up going their separate ways it is miraculous that this story could wind up being one of the great romantic films of all time. Before this viewing I decided to read all 1000+ pages of the book to become familiar with the source material. What is truly surprising for a Hollywood production is how faithful it is to the book. The only major exception, apart from a few missing characters, is the fact that in the book Scarlett had a child by each of her first two husbands.

THE CAST: Audiences at the time anticipated Gable in the role of Rhett, and he is dead-on target. It is impossible to think of anyone else playing the role or the film being the success it was without him. He was so good he was taken for granted at the time and passed over for an Oscar in favor of the gooey Mr. Chips. Vivien Leigh is Scarlett to the core. Olivia de Havilland as Melanie and Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes are both equally perfect. One should also mention Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her great performance as Mammy. The cast truly makes this picture the exceptional film that it is, under Victor Fleming's smooth direction, and David O. Selznick's perfect casting and supervision of the entire film.

Today it is mind-boggling to know that most of this was filmed on a Hollywood backlot. When the camera pulls back on the scene of a vast number of Confederate wounded on an Atlanta street you know those are all real people, which today would be created digitally. All in all it is a milestone in every respect. If you care at all about movies you have to have this.",1261267200,5,3406,4.59375

3352801,5,B0013N7FZ6,"I usually don't like purchasing collector's edition boxes as I don't usually care for the extra items and they are bulky to store. The boxed set of Gone With The Wind impressed me though. It is elegantly packaged in red velvet box and the extra items are awesome as well, like the David Selznick memos about choosing among Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn for the role of Rhett, the hardbound photo book and souvenir program reproduction. The price at Amazon was also almost half the regular price, so the purchase was well worth it. Best of all, I got the set yesterday on the day of release, even though I used the free-shipping option. I noticed that Amazon is now using Ontrac for delivery and the orders seem to arrive much quicker.

Now for the blu-ray itself...the transfer is simply awesome. The color correction and clarity are breathtaking. I actually noticed wrinkles on Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard's faces, which make you realize that they were actually older than the roles they played. The film is in the original 1.33 aspect ratio, which was common for movies in those days. I know some people are looking for the widescreen version, which this film was not originally shot in. If you have a good HDTV, the solution is simple by viewing using wide zoom to fill the screen. You lose part of the top and bottom details, but there's usually not much there. I do mind when they crop the sides to make widescreen fit regular screens (pan & scan) as you lose lots of details on the sides. However, if you want to see this movie in its original glory with all the details, then watch it in the original aspect ratio. I also like that the whole movie is in one disc for continuous viewing without having to change discs. You know how long it sometimes takes to load a blu-ray disc, but this one loads fast as they don't have the elaborate menus to slow it down.

There are many extras on the second disc and the only one I viewed so far was the restoration process, which is always fascinating to me because of the age of the movie.

Overall, this collection is well worth the purchase. I just wonder what they will come up next for the 75th anniversary. Maybe by that time HDTV's can display at 8000p and we'll end up seeing more details than available now.",1258502400,10,2276,4.492753623188406
3352802,5,B0013N7FZ6,"As with the ""Wizard of OZ"" BD set, the GWTW set is elaborated -- and made ""spendier"" -- with the addition of material that might not be absolutely necessary for one's enjoyment. The box is covered in red velvet flocking (green would have been more appropriate and amusing -- qv, Carol Burnett's classic sketch). There's a CD ""sampler"" of Max Steiner's score, running a measly 45 minutes. Given that Max took excessive scoring to the max (Bette Davis had some pointedly unkind things to say about it), a ""sampler"" could have filled two CDs, and still not have exhausted the music (though the music might exhaust you). *

As with ""OZ"", there's a 52-page hard-backed book that's largely content-free, plus reproductions of some of the watercolor set-design paintings (in their own little envelope), and various memoranda sent to and from David O. Selznick. I was expecting a reproduction of Gerald O'Hara's pocket watch, but it likely would have been of even poorer quality than the kiddie watch in the ""OZ"" box.

The best bonus is a reproduction of the 25-cent (expensive in 1939) souvenir booklet. It includes pieces by the principals, notably one from Clark Gable lying about how badly he wanted to play Rhett Butler and how much he enjoyed every minute of making the film. (He didn't want to appear in ""costume"" films (having had bad luck in a film about Irish revolutionaries), was afraid to take on a role the public had such definite ideas about, and got along poorly with the first director, George Cukor.)

As I write this, I haven't viewed all the supplemental material on the second disk. (There's a lot.) The third disk duplicates the ""When the Lion Roars"" feature included in the ""OZ"" box -- though the package labeling suggests it's unique to GWTW.

GWTW was always unsharp and muddy-looking -- until the Ultra Resolution transfer of the original three-strip negatives a few years ago. It was a major improvement, and the DVDs showed the film as it had never been seen.

This edition apparently uses a new Ultra Resolution transfer, at twice the resolution (8k versus 4k) of the previous. Some scenes -- such as Ashley escorting Melanie to the balcony of Twin Oaks -- are breathtaking, far superior to what the DVD offered (and /that/ wasn't exactly chopped liver). The best Technicolor films, properly transferred, push HD to its limit.

What most surprised me, though, was the awareness of how the film's color balance is adjusted to produce specific effects. Many scenes have an appropriately warm, ""burnished"" coloration that /does not/ carry over to the scene's subtle colors. For example, at the fund-raising bazaar, there's a bottle of pastel-colored candies (which you'll probably never notice in the SD edition) that retain their correct colors, ""unromantized"" by the rest of the image's warmth. Similarly, in the scene outside the hospital where Belle Watling makes a donation, her costume is vividly colored (there's no question about her profession!), even though everything else is drab.

Several sequences are outstanding, particularly the one where Scarlett returns to Aunt Pittypat's home to tend to Melanie. It's a model of Technicolor photography, one that any cinematographer would be proud of -- as good as anything being done today. In earlier transfers of poorer prints, this sequence is flat and two-dimensional. You can't see how magnificently lit and photographed it is.

At its best, the Technicolor resembles large-format, ultra-sharp Polacolor. That's a compliment! If you're fortunate enough to have a large display, you'll gasp at some of the images.

One of the most-startling moments occurs when Scarlett goes to the train station to look for Dr Meade, one of the most-famous scenes in movie history. Hundreds, if not thousands of injured men lie on the ground, waiting for medical attention that will likely never come. There weren't enough extras, so dummies were used. And for the first time, you can actually /see/ which of the ""extras"" are dummies! You can probably tell better than the camera operator!

In short... The BD edition is a major improvement over the excellent DVD edition. It gives the impression that the movie makers were able to manipulate Technicolor to get specific aesthetic effects. ** And it shows just how /beautifully photographed/ this film is, something even the original Technicolor prints never fully revealed. The DVD probably captured most of this (I no longer have it for comparison), but you'll never see it in standard definition on a ""small"" screen. Looking at excerpts in the supplmentary material /not/ taken from the Ultra Resolution transfer is a reminder of just how ""messy""-looking the original GWTW was. It no longer is. I've never enjoyed watching it so much.

It's becoming apparent that an HD transfer, shown on a big display, is not the best way to watch a movie at home, but the best way to watch a movie, period.

The sound is so-so, of limited range and not particularly clean. (Disney does a better job cleaning up the audio of its classic films.) The reviewer who said it filled the room as well as any modern soundtrack must own Bose 901s. It would sound better in a theater, with big horn speakers that started rolling off above 5kHz. If GWTW was recorded in RCA multi-track, the stems don't appear to have survived. (Those for ""OZ"" exist and have been used, though not, apparently in the Blu-ray.) Music and dialog are mono throughout, but individual sound effects (particulary explosions) are panned to the side or rear when appropriate. The music sometimes seems too loud for the dialog, and the overall level is by far the lowest of any Blu-ray I've yet auditioned. I had to really crank up the volume, far, far beyond 11.

This is an expensive set, but it represents such a significant improvement over the last DVD edition (as good as it was) that it's worth seriously considering. Even if your BD player has a good scaler, the DVD won't look anywhere nearly this good on your HD monitor. Highly recommended.

PS: Just because a film is a classic doesn't mean it's suitable for everyone in your family. The G rating is ridiculous. GWTW is at least PG, containing, as it does, women of questionable virtue, a fair amount of violence (including a scene in which Scarlett is attacked, and another in which she shoots a Yankee, practically blowing off his face), and Rhett dragging Scarlett up the stairs to ""molest"" her. The MPAA ratings board is nothing if not inconsistent.

PPS: Though Vivian Leigh and Hattie McDaniel received Oscars, I consider Butterfly McQueen's performance as Prissy the best in the film. Though she hated the role (it's too easy to interpret Prissy as representing slaves in general, rather than one in particular), she showed great courage in taking it, and delivers a finely nuanced performance.

* Max Steiner wrote the first great film score for a talky - ""King Kong"". It epitomizes his style -- ""Mickey-Mousing"" almost every screen action, and the heavy use of Leitmotivs for characters and events. (Note how Melanie's motive appears every time she does, and how Rhett's is played -- breaking the scene's mood -- when he leaves Scarlett for the last time.) He was also the first sound-film composer to underscore almost the entire length of a film -- this is not a recent development. It's worth noting that GWTW, despite some memorable music, did not win ""Best Score"" for 1939 -- Herbert Stothart's for ""Wizard of OZ"" did. I find Stothart's score considerably more imaginative and appealing.

** The Technicolor print uses dye transfer, in which each color is layed down separately from its own gelatin matrix. This allows a great deal of flexibility in controlling the contrast and color balance -- if you're willing to put out the time and money. According to the supplementary material, the color balance /was/ adjusted on scene-by-scene basis for GWTW, just as it is for modern films -- that's what the ""color timer"" person does. A high-quality print from 1939 was found, and guided the restorers in adjusting color balance.",1258416000,373,8063,4.943131462333826

  David O. Selznick would be beaming with pride at this incredible presentation in blu-ray, Gorgeous, lush and Deluxe all the way with a beautiful picture so incredibly fresh and new. The sound is magnificent and fills the room with depth and breadth of a modern film.
  The extras are a huge treat to any fan of the film. The magnificent ""M.G.M. When the Lion Roared"" documentary is superlative, as is the ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"". There are hours and hours of enjoyment for any fan of the movies of a long gone era.
  What a treat too to discover the old T.V. film, ""Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War.""  In my estimation one of the few great films about the history of Hollywood ever made.
  Note that only the film is Blue Ray and all the extras are regular DVD resolution, but no problem there for me. I am just thrilled to have this in my collection.

that Gone With the Wind is the saga of a Southern Twit.
As I was born in West (by God) Virginia, I have no Confederate leanings
or sympathies. But it's a great movie for all the familiar
reasons. The Making Of feature is at least as good as the movie,
and I enjoyed it more. I doubt they remastered this
documentary for Blu Ray, but they
sure should have. It's amazing stuff.

But: Most HDTVs are not correctly set.
For LCD HDTV:
View in a dark room--
Set mode to 'cinema --
 drop the backlight to about half--
 Turn off all enhancement features

3352807,4,B0013N7FZ6,"You know the drill: Scarlett ignores Rhett and pursues Melanie's husband Ashley while Atlanta burns down around her.  My two cents worth: The portrayal of the Civil War and the aftermath were superb, especially for the 1930's. Costuming and set design were also very impressive, especially in the restored version. The colors were vivid, and the people were all ideally cast for their parts. I just couldn't stand anybody in the movie. Scarlett was a jealous, spoiled brat, the stereotypical ""evil sorority chick"" type. Rhett came off better, even though he had a wicked temper; he should have left sooner, or better yet, never married her in the first place. Melanie was ""good"", to the point where people took advantage of her. And Ashley... was he supposed to be good looking back then, or what? Because he didn't seem to have much going on in the personality department. Mammy was the only one who had any sense, and nobody listened to her.  Recommendations: Oh, I don't know. Casablanca?

After an hour, I felt like I had seen two hours. And the film keeps this up for four hours. There is much that this film can teach film school undergrads.

The setting, however, is a double-edged sword. As the title-card indicates, this film s a glamorization of the Antebellum South. So we get the Code of Honor, dignity, propriety, Southern Hospitality, and all the good things of a refined society. But we also get the slave stereotypes. They are both laughable and sad. However, if you pay close attention, the slaves/freedmen are some the most noble characters in the story. Mammie has the best head on her shoulders.

This film's weakest point is characterization. Rhett is both a Han Solo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Han-Solo-Adventures-Classic-Star-Wars/dp/0345394429/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Han Solo Adventures (Classic Star Wars)</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/6305736650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>&nbsp;Rick character, a cultured Wolverine who lives by his own code of ethics, but also can be a good person if need be.

For her part, Scarelett is an abomination. For the first half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting tease. In the second half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting gold-digger. She focuses on being the center of attention at parties, complains that her widow's garb makes her look unfashionable, and stops childbearing because it adds two inches on to her waist.

""As for my people, children are their oppressors.""

Her greatest folly is her view of love and romance. She loves A, and never comes to terms that she cannot have a married man (Rhett's comment about Ashley's double-standard of fidelity is well-placed), so she marries B out of spite. As a war-widow, she puts off C's advances (Rhett), and marries D, for his money and business. A widow again, she finally marries C (Rhett), who, to his credit, gives up his blockade-ruining and settles down to domestic bliss. But she still pines away for A. Got it?

Rhett suggests that they divorce, so she can have the love she really desires, but Scarlett declines, citing the scandal.

But she admits she still loves A, and when his wife dies, Rhett feels threatened, so she changes her mind again, and wants to stay with Rhett.

Like Kevin Federline (Mr. Britney Spears #2,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playing-with-Fire/dp/B000IU3YLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playing with Fire</a>), Rhett has the better head on his shoulders and leaves. We wish he had left Scarlett sooner.

Scarlett does have redeemable characteristics. She delivers a baby in burning Atlanta, holds her family together during Reconstruction--becoming a surrogate mother to her younger sisters and addled father. She has spunk and grit, but these emerge in survival or selfish situations. But when it comes to love, marriage, and motherhood, she remains forever a pouty fourteen-year-old.

(And people think Robotech's Minmei is bad! Sheesh!)

We focus on that one famous word at the end of the movie, but there are other problem areas. There are a lot of underwear scenes--the laughable old-fashioned bloomers, but it did began a trend.

Then there is the Up The Staircase scene. Um, as they depicted it, Scarlett seemed to enjoy it. What type of message are sending to women???

And what message are we sending to women about romance and love? Scarlett's one motivation is her love--puppy-love, really--for Ashley. In this aspect, she is as monomaniacally obsessed as Captain Ahab. She is not a person, just an unmet need.

Also, there is a more insidious message--the importance of dealing with life's harsh, but empowering realities. She had three husbands, but that was not enough. Like King David, she coveted the poor person's lambling. She never accepts this empowering reality, and so she never grew up. She spent her days discontented and mopey.

The ending is appropriate. Rhett reads the handwriting on the wall, and packs up. Scarlett, the perpetual fickle teenager, pleas ""If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?""

This is a perversion of Ruth's plea to Naomi: ""Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.""

I think this highlights the inverted ethics of this film. The film is beautiful to watch and well executed, but the ethical framework is an eyesore.",1252454400,5,6519,6.361268403171008
