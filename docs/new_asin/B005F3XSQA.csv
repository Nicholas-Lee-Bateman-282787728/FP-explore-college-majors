4672349,5,B005F3XSQA,"This is full of clever and well orchestrated music. Louis Jordan is largely forgotten these days, and it's a shame. I am happy this is even available, as it was a joy to watch. Anyone who doesn't know, check out some video clips of Louis online. Great stuff.",1386201600,2,258,4.395833333333333
4672350,3,B005F3XSQA,"Beware is actually a pretty decent horror film, but there's a distinct issue of pacing that distracts from the experience.  Maybe it's just me, but the storyline (especially in the beginning) seems to move at a crawl and it's not like it's moving so slow because a really engaging storyline is in the process of developing but rather, several moments of useless fluff is standing in the way of progression.

The first 30 minutes are *really* long.  A group of teens are travelling on the road and hoping for one final gathering before they all go their separate ways.  Yup, that crucial changing point in every young persons life- the understanding that all the partying and hanging out is soon going to be over for good.  As the one girl so eagerly explains ""This is probably going to be our last trip together so let's make it count"".  The group of young adults eventually encounter engine troubles that force them to make a stop at a nearby gas station and this is when the pacing feels underwhelming and overlong.  WAY too much time was devoted to the group of friends just roaming around the gas station and having fun doing absolutely nothing.

When it's discovered that the crucial part for the car won't be in until the next day, the group then has to make a decision- do we walk 10 miles to the nearest hotel, or hitch a ride with a woman?

Well they make their choice and... this is when the film finally gets going.  After a VERY well done piece of writing pertaining to the story of a chained man stuck in the woods for years due to an abusive, alcoholic father (and whether it's true or just a made up story) the suspense REALLY picks up in a dramatic way.  Of course it's unrealistic and way out of line that the group of immature young adults would basically call the woman crazy for sharing such a hard-to-swallow story, and that's a major flaw.  That'd be like me inviting myself into somebody's home and insulting their belongings and beliefs.  Just totally unrealistic writing that I didn't care for.  Even though the woman took it in stride, it's still wrong.

Anyway my favorite scene is when the chained man cuts somebody's stomach and their guts slither out like a dead deer.  Beautiful!  The final 30 minutes is really intense and totally worth your time if you fancy blood and violence to the highest extent (along with a surprising twist near the end) but otherwise pacing issues and the questionable first half makes this film way longer than it should have been.",1353196800,9,2490,4.584650112866817
4672351,4,B005F3XSQA,"The film is the typical mistreated boy grows up feral in the woods and becomes a local legendary killer...with a slight twist. It is a slasher film, with blood, guts, and a head roll. Hispanic cast made for a nice change. The music sound track was by Cinder Road which sounds similar to NIN. The film attempted to add some humor, but it didn't come off too well. The lines were not that well written. Pretty much everything you expect in a slasher film plus Guitar Hero.

4672353,4,B005F3XSQA,"Of the R&B pioneer Louis Jordan's series of low-budget musical comedies, this is the best by far. An interesting look at Black college life in the 1940s, this is the tale of Jordan returning to his old college to settle scores with a rival and raise money to save the school. Not as corny as it sounds. A bit more story and better acting than what usually appeared in Jordan's comedies. Jordan is of course at his best with his clowing and singing, and sax playing, but he also shows that he could really act when called to do so. Check it and enjoy.",1007683200,5,550,4.298076923076923

8469594,5,B005F3XSQA,"This is  a film that I stumbled upon while looking for a film starring the French actor Louis Jourdan (and I misspelled his name).

It is the story of a black college facing financial ruin. Louis Jordan to the rescue! To sing and play music with his band. The usual fundraiser effort story - with great music and not much in the way of sets or production values. Do you really need those when you have the talents of Mr. Jordan? If you love Swing, this is for you. It's an all black cast; the plot is so basic, it's mere window-dressing to the music. Good stuff, well worth listening to.

8469597,1,B005F3XSQA,"Now here is a film with an appropriate titleBewareAs in beware of watching this utter amateurish piece of junk.  I mean I hate to kill an independent horror as I love indy horrors but this one is just atrocious on every level.  We start with the stereotypical group of kids (the back cover calls them teenagers but if they're teenagers then so am I) out on a final weekend trip together before returning to school.  Right on cue their SUV breaks down in a backwater town called Shady Grove where several murders were committed a few years earlier.  The characters are bargain bid one dimensional cutouts purchased at the slasher film dollar store.  Theres the sex-crazed couple (you know thell be the first to get killed), the shy, nerdy character, the quiet male leader, and the cute and smart female lead who you know will be the final survivor.

A local woman named Maria allows the group to spend the night at her house as they wait for their vehicle to be fixed.  Maria relates the tales of the murder and the local urban myth of a boy named Shane who is chained in the woods for years when his father finds out hes not the actual biological father and kills his wife.  No reallyIm not making this up.  So apparently this boy who was maybe about 10 when he was chained up, is left out there even though the town apparently knows about it.  I say apparently because nothing in this film is all that clear.  Half the film is told in numerous flashbacks to different time periods making it a confusing mess.  Once we get the films plot twist it sends the whole thing careening out of control.

The acting is as bad as I have seen in a longlong time.  Not surprising considering that this was the first role for several members of the cast.  Im still trying to figure out if they were trying to be funny-bad or if they were just that bad.  Not even the slasher elements are able to save this dud.  About the only redeeming quality the film has is several attractive female characters but it gets to the point where youd rather just see them dead so the film can mercifully come to an end.",1438387200,2,2089,4.3984375
