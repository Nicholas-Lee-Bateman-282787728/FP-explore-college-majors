3465967,5,B001ARDBXK,"Starring Sidney Toler, Volume 5 includes the final seven Charlie Chan films from 20th Century Fox. They are: Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum (1940), Murder Over New York (1940), Dead Men Tell (1941), Charlie Chan In Rio (1941), Charlie Chan In Panama, Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise (1940) and Castle In The Desert (1942). Toler would continue to play Chan in subsequent films for other studios, but those films were of lower quality in plot and production values than the Fox Chan films. The following is the press release for this set of seldom seen films:

The films are presented in the original full screen format with English Mono and Spanish and French subtitles. All titles included in the collection feature original theatrical trailers as well as still and advertising galleries. Also included is The Era of Chan, a 30 minute documentary celebrating the legacy of the Chan series at Fox. Focusing on the series' final seven films and the talents behind them, this piece gives an overview of the series' success and how the Chan character rose to the status of icon, influencing many screen detectives to come.

If you are accustomed to Warner Oland's Charlie Chan, Sidney Toler's interpretation is a less gentle one. In fact, Toler can seem impatient and even angry at times. However, Toler does manage to make the role work and these films are worth the time of any fan of the series.",1214611200,36,1392,4.820083682008368

Charlie Chan mysteries are so intertwined with suspects that even I cannot figure it out.  That's why I love them.  Plus being an hour and half long makes it perfect for a movie after work without having to pause to go to bed and catch remainder of the movie the next night.  This package has 2 movies per disc and the value is great.  Sidney Toler is my favorite Chan and each story has intermittent comedy which adds to the suspense and plot.  If you like mysteries, you will love Charlie Chan.",1486512000,,660,4.404958677685951

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Over forty popular movies featured Charlie Chan. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China and in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies.

Warner Oland was the first actor to play Charlie Chan. Sidney Toler replaced him after Olands death. Tolers movies had more humor. This volume contains seven movies and a documentary. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations in the past, todays TV prefers films in color. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies with a recurring detective. See the individual reviews for more details. Read the books Charlie Chan at the Movies by Ken Hanke, and Charlie Chan by Yunte Huang, for background information.

3466129,3,B001ARDBXK,"Cinema Classics has published a collection of ""Charlie Chan"" films and wisely issued the films in ""Warner Oland"" and ""Sidney Toler"" versions. Personally, I'm not a Sidney Toler fan. His ""Charlie Chan"" was a caricature of Charlie, not a portrayal. The scripts were propaganda (pre-war, left of Mao) and the stories borrowed heavily from the earlier films featuring Warner Oland. In fact, they ""borrowed"" so heavily that its annoying.

So why bother? Because it is instructive to view both versions of Charlie Chan (Oland/Toler) - that's why.

The Volume 5 collection contains 7 of the definitive ""Toler"" films: Murder Cruise, Over New York, Men Tell, Rio, etc. This is a very good sampling and the editor who packaged these films clearly knew what he was doing. ""Don't Tell"" is marvelously horrid. Much of the film is re-cycled bits from earlier (Oland) films, the acting is over the top to the point of being camp and the ""messages"" are blatant to the point of being insulting. e.g. Yes, we understand that the good psycho-therapist and her patient are Gay stereotypes. Yeah, we get it. We really got it! OK?

3466132,5,B001ARDBXK,"The final boxed set of the Fox Charlie Chan series, starring Sidney Toler as the wise and heroic Chinese detective, is a crucial addition to any Mystery film library despite the somewhat variable quality of the films themselves.

I find PANAMA (4/5 Excellent), while dated, a first-rate entry  with a supporting cast even more colorful than its locale.

WAX MUSEUM (4/5 Outstanding), with its eerie setting evocative of such superior Gothic classics as THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM and HOUSE OF WAX (1953), is an above-average entry with special appeal, just spooky enough to be memorable.

Although well-crafted, photographed and performed, sparked by some reasonably exciting scenes, I find MURDER OVER NEW YORK (3/5 Average) generally unimpressive due to its routine story and writing.

DEAD MEN TELL (4/5 Outstanding) is a a strong entry elevated by especially rich visual style, as are all the late Toler entries directed by Harry Lachman.

RIO and MURDER CRUISE (both 3/5 Good) are otherwise unexceptional Sidney Toler entries, significant as the only attempts at new versions of Earl Derr Biggers novels previously filmed with Warner Oland (THE BLACK CAMEL and the lost CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON, respectively).

The Fox Charlie Chan series goes out with a bang with Lachman's CASTLE IN THE DESERT (5/5 Extraordinary), one of the very best of the Toler films. An insane story combines with the best kind of Classic-Horror tropes in a High Gothic setting, graced with a rich supporting cast. Again director Harry Lachman emphasizes imaginative visual style which is most appropriate to this crossover genre piece.

This final group of Fox entries may not represent the cream of the series, but no matter. We cherish the Charlie Chan films less for their mystery plots than for their vivid atmosphere of ""mysterioso"" which these offer in abundance.

Sidney Toler was hardly finished with Charlie Chan, however; he continued playing the character in no less than eleven low-budget entries for Monogram studios.

As with Fox's previous four DVD boxed sets of the Charlie Chan series, great care has been taken in restoring these vintage films which have never looked better. Unlike the other sets, a few of the discs are two-sided, but no matter, as we get fully seven classic movies at a more than reasonable price.

Actually, the CC in the Wax Museum has some very interesting plot twists that could have made a really good movie in the hands of a competent director.  Also, if the director of CC in Rio had stopped to check on Brazilian Law related to crimes of passion and blackmail at the time of the movie, the ending would have far better for the viewer, i.e., the doers of the deed would have gone free.

3466140,3,B001ARDBXK,"Fox's fifth and final collection of Charlie Chan films covers the final batch of Sidney Toler films from the studio, and a very mixed bag they are - some great fun, some sluggish.

""Bad alibi like dead fish - cannot stand test of time.""

After the striking City in Darkness saw Charlie in a Paris riven with rumours of impending war, 1940's Charlie Chan in Panama is a more conventional flagwaver that sees Charlie undercover in Panama amid mysterious spies, nightclub owners, displaced refugee singers, mystery writers, holidaying spinsters, Egyptian cigarette dealers and a shifty looking scientist injecting rats with bubonic plague. Our hero makes a surprisingly late entry into the story and as usual it's not too much of a stretch to guess who the murderous nazi agent out to sabotage the Panama Canal is, and, despite the word Nazi never being used, it's just as obvious which party is throwing the party. Substituting the palpable fear and panic of City in Darkness for an atmosphere of mistrust as America's involvement in the war looks increasingly inevitable, it's not quite as effective but is still a very decent little entry in he series, benefiting from a decent supporting cast including Lionel Atwill, Frank Puglia, Mary Nash and Flash Gordon's squeeze Jean Rogers, with Victor Sen-Yung finally getting out of Keye Luke's shadow and making the role of Number Two Son his own while director Norman Foster manages to keep things fairly fresh despite already having helped Mr. Moto foil a similar plot to sabotage the Suez Canal in Mr. Moto's Last Warning only the previous year. In fact, this was originally intended as a Mr. Moto film until anti-Japanese feeling killed off that series, offering a neat bit of symmetry with the earlier Mr. Moto's Gamble, which had originally been intended as a Charlie Chan film.

The DVD includes the original trailer and stills galleries.

""When Chinese Emperor have eight suspects of murder, he solve problem very quickly.""
""Really? How?""
""Chop off eight head. Always sure of getting one criminal.""

Charlie Chan Carries On may have been the film that introduced Warner Oland as the titular Chinese sleuth and spawned one of Hollywood's longest running series of movies, but it's a particular irony that despite its huge popularity in 1931, it's long been lost while the simultaneously filmed Spanish version, Eran Trece, and the 1940 Sidney Toler remake Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise, are still in fine shape. The latter at least offers a structural improvement on the earlier version, which was nearly half over before Charlie was even introduced. This time round the backstory is quickly covered in the opening scene before another of Charlie's old friends meets an unfortunate end and the detective is joining the last leg of a world cruise to find out which of the passengers is a strangler out for revenge. And, with Lionel Atwill organising the tour and its passengers including Leo G. Carroll and Charles Middleton, there should be enough for a decent mystery, yet this marks the series' descent into B-movie territory in the worst way: where the original broke off the voyage for backlot excursions, this is confined almost entirely to its cabins, and it's definitely travelling second class. As if the limited and bland sets aren't enough of a problem, it's all executed with the minimum of imagination and enthusiasm by the screenwriters and director Eugene Ford, constantly getting becalmed by the routine and the predictable. You're better off sticking with the Spanish version (available as an extra on Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 1 (Charlie Chan in London / Charlie Chan in Paris / Charlie Chan in Egypt / Charlie Chan in Shanghai / Eran Trece)), and that's not particularly good either.

The DVD includes the original trailer and stills galleries.

""Only very foolish mouse makes nest in cat's ear.""

Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum gets off to a great start with hoodlum Marc Lawrence sentenced to death on the week of December 9th and sneering ""Thank you, judge. I won't have to do any Christmas shopping."" It's not long before he's escaped and is out for revenge on the Chan who put him away, hiding out in C. Henry Gordon's lurid waterfront wax museum offering `24 sermons in wax' and conveniently also location of a weekly radio show, ""The Crime League, brought to you through the courtesy of the Murphy Arms Company,"" which just happens to have a certain Oriental detective on this week's broadcast in a challenge to prove the guilt or innocence of a man convicted of murder. But Lawrence isn't the only one with murder on his mind, the museum harbouring a killer with a new face and a serious grudge...

Despite throwing in a cockamamie electrocution murder, blow darts, plastic surgery, mechanical chessmen and hidden chambers as well as the usual unwanted comic relief from Number Two Son Victor Sen-Yung, this never manages to live up to its opening promise. Confining the action to a few characters in a few rooms in the wax museum, it looks more like an attempt to save money than to build up some claustrophobic tension, and some very lazy writing sees one gatecrasher's identity never explained as he goes from suspect to romantic interest in the blink of an eye. Not the best of Toler's Fox Chans by a long shot, but certainly better than some of the weaker later Monogram entries.

The DVD includes the trailer, albeit without sound for the opening section, as well as a stills gallery with some nice shots of the very convincing wax head of Sidney Toler as well as a misplaced still from another film in the series.

""Coincidence like ancient egg, leave unpleasant odour.""

Murder Over New York sees Sidney Toler curious bottom billed - albeit in larger type - and Charlie Chan's name removed from the title, but it's a very decent entry in the Fox series that sees him on the trail of the murderer of an old friend from Scotland Yard (if a friend of Chan's dies, it'll usually be one from Scotland Yard) who was on the trail of a German spy ring trying to sabotage a new bomber plane. Being 1940 before America had entered the war, they can't actually call them Germans, but they're not exactly fooling anyone into thinking they aren't. Once again the miracles of plastic surgery are wildly exaggerated as the mastermind behind the saboteurs has been altered so that even his own ex-wife can't recognise him and once again clues are withheld until the final gathering of the suspects that sees the killer unmasked but a few plot holes lingering.

It's certainly not the most original of the series - one of the suspects is Boggs the butler while even the method of the murders had been used by both one of Boris Karloff's Mr Wong films and 1935's Charlie Chan in Egypt - yet it is an entertaining one with a very decent supporting cast including John Sutton, Melville Cooper and Ricardo Cortez, one of many suspects from previous films to make a reappearance in a different role. There's one bizarre plot development that sees the police rounding up every Hindu in town, leading a frazzled Victor Sen-Yung to despairingly cry ""They're all starting to look the same to me,"" but it's hard to take offence at anything here unless you're really trying.

The DVD includes the original trailer and stills galleries.

""Perhaps insane act designed to direct suspicion toward person of unsound mind.""
""Which one of us could that be?""

Thanks to Harry Lachman's visually striking direction that makes the most of its shipboard and dockside locations, Dead Men Tell is one of the handsomest looking Chan films. When not tyrannising actors, Lachman was an accomplished painter, and he has a great sense of composition and atmosphere. It helps that it's a pretty decent script as well, with Victor Sen-Yung's Number Two Son trying to work his way onto a treasure cruise in search of buried pirate gold with pop in hot pursuit only to stumble across another murder. It's a cracking little yarn that throws in plenty of clich&eacute;s, from a pirate's ghosts, various pieces of a treasure map distributed among various suspects/potential victims and the obligatory parrot jokes, but it works so well you won't complain.

Suspects include George Reeves' reporter, who's looking very healthy for someone who reportedly died six months earlier (and this nearly a decade before he became Superman), unlikely ""He-Man actor"" Paul McGrath and neurotic Milton Parsons (""Perhaps insane act designed to direct suspicion toward person of unsound mind."" ""Which one of us could that be?""). But the most memorable performance comes from Ethel Griffies as the wonderfully monikered Miss Patience Nodbury: the plot dictates she doesn't get much screen time, but she makes such an impression it's no surprise they wrote a prominent role for her in the last Fox Chan film, Castle in the Desert. There's a running gag with Jimmy falling in the water, on one occasion after inevitably walking the plank, but otherwise the comedy isn't overdone beyond the usual running putdowns (""Hey, pop, you're not gonna swallow that story, are you?"" ""Swallow much, but digest little.""). Great fun

The DVD includes the original trailer and stills galleries.

""The murderer may or may not be a professional. But one thing is sure. He, or she, is extremely cool-headed, cold-blooded -""
""And very stupid.""
""But why stupid pop? It's got me puzzled.""
""That prove my point very well.""

Charlie Chan in Rio is a remake of the early Warner Oland film The Black Camel, then believed lost after a fire destroyed the negative, and even features that version's director Hamilton McFadden in an unflattering supporting role as an amateur Dick Bartonesque Englishman. It's perhaps more solid than inspired, but despite being very obviously shot on a much tighter budget than the original it's not quite as awkward. The plot has seen a substantial reworking as well as a shift from Honolulu: rather than the victim being an actress making a film on location she's now a singer that Charlie has come to Rio to extradite for murder. Bela Lugosi's spiritualist has been replaced by Victor Jory's hypnotist-cum-psychic, who uses his own brand of funny cigarettes to uncover the secrets his clients would rather left uncovered (as Number Two Son Victor Sen-Yung notes, ""Watch out, pop, he's oily and slippery!"").

Harold Huber is more restrained here than in his previous Chan outing, City in Darkness, allowing our hero a more intelligent sidekick, but unfortunately Jimmy Chan is too much of an irritant here (""Oh listen, pop, what do I have to bring you, a talking picture of the killer knifing Miss Dean? In the back?""). It feels a bit mechanical at times, but it is fun to see Charlie blissfully puffing away on those funny cigarettes of Jory's...

Extras are again limited to he original trailer, albeit without the original captions in this case, and a stills gallery.

""Paul, we're waiting for you.""
""Coming, dear. I thought I heard someone in the dungeon.""

Charlie's tenure as the Number One detective on the Fox lot came to an end with 1942's Castle in the Desert, and thankfully it's a good one. This time he's summoned to a castle in the desert - who saw that coming? - owned by the unfortunately named Lucy Borgia, a direct descendant of the infamous family (""I promise not to poison you"") who lives in seclusion with her historian husband Douglas Dumbrille, who wears a silk mask over half his face and doth protest too much that he's as sane as the next man. Only neither of them was responsible for his invitation... Could it be related to the poisoning we saw before his arrival? Is it a scheme to have one or both of them committed? Naturally it's not long before another guest is poisoned, the car that's their only way out is sabotaged and there are no phones to call for help from the police...

On paper this is probably the silliest of all the Fox Chan films, and yet by relocating its gothic horror clich&eacute;s to a daylight desert setting it works a treat. The castle interiors may be thrown together from bits and pieces of earlier, more expensive Fox pictures, but why complain when it looks so good? The same could be said of the plot: it's formulaic, but the formula works. Chan certainly has to put up with more than his share of racial insults this time round, whether it's the local hotel owner's ""You a chop suey salesman? Well don't try and sell me, I hate the stuff"" or ""You're the new cook or houseboy?"" once he reaches the castle, but they tend to make those insulting him look stupid rather than him. Unfortunately Victor Sen Yung's Jimmy Chan is along for the ride, and as usual he doesn't need any racial stereotyping to look stupid, but if he's just there to give Sidney Toler someone to put down, his presence is offset by a decent supporting cast including Henry Daniell and Ethel Griffies and Milburn Stone from Dead Men Tell. Stylishly directed by Harry Lachman with an atmospheric and at times intricate Emil Newman score, it's a fine sendoff for the Fox Charlie Chan series.

While there are no individual documentaries on each film in this final set, there is one excellent roundup of Toler's last films for Fox included with Castle in the Desert. The original trailer and stills galleries are also included.",1345507200,6,13279,4.8490732568402475

3466145,5,B001ARDBXK,"I am a total sucker for Charlie Chan films. I loved them as a kid and missed them for the nearly 2 decades that they disappeared from television because of charges of negative Asian stereotyping. I have purchased all of the available Chan collections on DVD and eagerly await the release of the remaining couple of Sidney Tolers and the last few with Roland Winters.

However, in watching the Chans again on DVD, I can recognize something that eluded me as a boy----that there is a drop in quality after the series moved to Monogram. I am not saying anything here that others have not said, but while I still enjoy them to some degree, watching Sidney Toler turn into a straight man for the comedy-team antics of Jimmy Chan (Benson Fong) and Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland) is a bit off-putting.

All of which actually makes me cherish the last of the great Chans even more. While ""Wax Museum"" and ""Dead Men Tell"" are not classics, ""Murder Over New York"", ""Castle In The Desert"", ""In Panama"", ""In Rio"" and ""Murder Cruise"" are vintage Charlie: very good stories, very good timing and very good acting.",1329177600,,1103,4.680412371134021

Dead Men Tell - note the appearance by TV's Superman.

Castle in the Desert - fun story, neat background.

Charlie Chan in Panama - great story based on the fear of spying at the Canal.

Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum - conflicting interests among the villainous sets.

Charlie Chan in Rio - ""The Samba is really catching on down here!""  I love Jimmy.

3466149,5,B001ARDBXK,"Having recently watched quite a few CC films, and done some research, I
have come to the conclusion that the 20th Century Fox productions were
the most professional, regardless of whether Toler or Oland was the star.
I prefer Toler but also like Oland as well. The films in this volume are amongst the best of the CC series. Having suffered thru viewings of YouTube
versions of (mostly) Monogram efforts, these films of Vol 5 are a welcome
relief - their quality is quite good. Actually, if the video were perfect
I would probably consider them not as accurate renditions of what I grew up with, and somehow phoney versions of a good old CC film. For those who
complain about the production quality, I can say that these films were made on a very restricted budget and timeframe. They turned out roughly one CC film every 3 months, and often the actual shooting was completed in less than 10 days. You can imagine how few retakes were possible, and how much the quality suffered. Nor were the scripts consistently very good - there were about 7 different scriptwriters involved in the 11 Fox/Toler films. Comparing a CC film's production values to those of an A film, either then or now, is
an exercise in futility. I'm sure Gone with the Wind spent more on just the scene of the burning of Atlanta than Fox did on several complete CC offerings.
However, because the film was a series in which the two main characters (Chan and son) were not only accomplished actors, but also had gained plenty of experience with their character, the films have a solid feel to them
and feel more realistic than they, strictly speaking, probably are. My biggest gripe are the much overdone ""scary comedy relief"" scenes usually
involving Marsten and the Chan son. They represent obvious padding of the script and serve no purpose. Cheaply made or not, these films are a real pleasure to watch. Very comfortable, like a pair of well-worn old shoes.
I only wish they had made about 50 more of them.",1304640000,,1979,4.641025641025641

This volume is with Number 2 son and is a nice selection which we have enjoyed several times over. After watching, I'm sure it was the Sidney Toler episodes as Charlie that I was mostly recalling.

I wish I knew what makes the old movies engaging even when you know the plot and how the story ends.  I'm grateful they were able to find film on put these on dvd.  Sometimes the sound has that hollow studio set sound for supposedly outdoor scenes, but it just seems to add to the charm.

3466157,5,B001ARDBXK,"Volume Five of the Cinema Classics Charlie Chan Collection has seven excellent murder mysteries from the long-running movie series.  All are one hour features produced between 1940 and 1942, featuring Sidney Toler as the iconic Honolulu Police Lieutenant, with Victor Sen Yung as number two son Jimmy Chan.

""Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise"" has Chan avenging the murderer of a police colleague on a high society pleasure cruise.  In ""Charlie Chan in Panama"", our detective tries to stop a plot to block the Panama Canal and trap a US Navy Fleet.  In ""Murder Over New York"", Charlie Chan hunts saboteurs after an Army Air Force bomber project.  ""Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum"" features a closed house murder mystery in a San Francisco crime museum.  ""Dead Men Tell"" has Charlie Chan and Jimmy seemingly on the trail of a ghostly, murderous pirate who plagues a treasure hunt.  In ""Charlie Chan in Rio"", Charlie tries to solve the murder of a popular night club singer, while Jimmy romances a Chinese maid.  ""Castle in the Desert"" moves the closed house murder mystery to a isolated location in the Mojave Desert, full of strange characters.

These movies were made in the shadow of the Second World War, already well underway in Europe.  The storylines show an increasing emphasis on spies and plots connected with the war effort, and less on traditional crimes.  Fox Studios ended their run with the titular character after ""Castle in the Desert"", although the series was taken up by another studio.

This boxed set includes the original theater trailers for each movie, and a special featurette on the Charlie Chan franchise.  ""Volume Five"" is highly recommended to fans of the Charlie Chan series.",1268438400,2,1698,4.957597173144876

  Notice that there is no mention of the meticulous restoration as in the previous volumes and no restoration comparisons presented as bonus material as well! Look closely at the films: many scenes in the films have obvious deterioration in them with heaps of scratches and flashes in many of the scenes!
  Notice that a mysterious statement at the beginning of 4 of the films states: We have brought this film to DVD using the best surviving source material available"". This is a very sneaky and confusing way to say they were not were restored!
  Overall, the films are of fairly decent video quality with ""Murder Cruise"", ""In Panama"", ""In Rio"", and ""Castle"" having the best of the lot. ""Murder Over NY"", ""Dead Men Tell"", and ""Wax Museum"" have  the most deterioration and blemishes.

3466168,5,B001ARDBXK,"Charlie Chan was originally created by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who very loosely based the character on Hawaii's legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933.) Biggers wrote six novels in all, and after several false starts 20th Century Fox (then simply known as Fox) hit on the right combination of actors, mystery, and comedy. The result was perhaps the single most popular film series Hollywood ever created.

Between 1931 and 1938 Chan was played by noted character actor Warner Oland. When Oland died, 20th Century Fox scrambled to find a new actor for the role--and ultimately assigned the part to Sidney Toler, who was well-regarded on stage but little known through films. In Toler's hands the character became less formal and the films began to emphasize comedy to a degree not previously seen. Some fans rebelled at the change, and even today fans continue to argue the merits of Oland vs. Toler. Even so, most fans would agree they enjoy both actors in the role.

The 5th collection of Chan DVDs released by 20th Century Fox includes several of the best films in the series.  But sadly, 20th Century does not give this set the same loving touch earlier sets received: not only are the films released on the much-hated double-sided DVDs, the bonus material is either non-descript or simply not there at all, and it seems to me that the release was rushed through on the cheap.  Even so, the films themselves are welcome and have received a reasonable restoration--and that is enough to make them welcome inclusions in any Chan fan's collection.

All five of the titles offered in the collection were released between 1940 and 1941, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor led the studio to discontinue the series, fearing audiences would become antagonistic toward its Asian characters.  (This proved a mistake--actor Sidney Toler bought the screen rights and took them to poverty row Monogram Studio, where in spite of third and forth-rate scripts and supporting casts Chan films remained popular through 1949.)  The titles included are: CHARLIE CHAN'S MURDER CRUISE; CHARLIE CHAN AT THE WAX MUSEUM; CHARLIE CHAN IN PANAMA; MURDER OVER NEW YORK; DEAD MEN TELL; CHARLIE CHAN IN RIO; and CASTLE IN THE DESERT.  All feature Sidney Toler as Chan and Victor Sen Yung as number two son Jimmy Chan.

MURDER CRUISE seems to be a remake of CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE, a lost film, and it is among my favorites in the series, presenting us with a memorable cast including Lionel Atwill, Leo G. Carrol, Claire du Brey, and a truly winning turn from character actress Cora Witherspoon.  This is easily among the most entertaining of the Toler films and a personal favorite.  WAX MUSEUM offers a particularly improbable plot, but is no less the entertaining for that, and again the performers make the show quite a bit of fun--in this case  including C. Henry Gordon, Marc Lawrence, and Joan Valerie, among others.

IN PANAMA is generally considered one of the best Toler films, and I have to agree.  Although the United States had not entered World War II at this point, the war informs everything about the film, which concerns an attempt to destroy the Panama Canal.  Again the supporting cast--especially Mary Nash and Lionel Atwill--is particularly fine, and the film ends on an unexpectedly somber note in anticipation of the war to come.  Released in 1941, MURDER OVER NEW YORK seems to borrow from a number of earlier Chan films, as well as a Mr. Wong film, and is similar to PANAMA in the sense that it has an ""anticipating war"" quality in its tale of military sabatoge; although I would not include it among the best of the series, a strong cast and quick pace makes it enjoyable.

DEAD MEN TELL tends to be a film that divides Chan films: you either like or you don't, and I fall among the latter, for I find it lacks the light touch that makes Chan movies so entertaining.  Set aboard a ship about to set sale on a treasure search, the film does offer an enjoyable turn by noted character actress Ethel Griffries and some atmospheric photography, but beyond this it holds not great interest for me.  IN RIO, however, is easily the weakest of the films in this collection, a sub-par remake of the 1931 Chan THE BLACK CAMEL that fails to click in spite of the always welcome presence of Kay Linaker.

Perhaps the single most prized film in this collection is the final Chan film to be released by 20th Century Fox, the seldom-seen CASTLE IN THE DESERT.  The plot is particularly far-fetched and wild, but it plays with a great deal of atmosphere, at a fast clip, and with a light touch--and includes what may be Ethel Griffries single most memorable performance in a long career of memorable character portraits.

It is true that 20th Century Fox gave these final films in the series the short end of the stick in their release, but even so the films themselves are essential for anyone who enjoys the series--and I give the collection five stars on that basis.  As Chan himself would say, ""Thank you so much!""

3466172,5,B001ARDBXK,"Though these are the final 20th Century Fox (aka ""big budget"") Charlie Chan films before going to Monogram, they may be the most enjoyable.  Sidney Toler did not originate the role of Chan (the wonderful Warner Oland did), but Toler truly made it his own.  By this final batch of films, FOX and Toler were no longer trying to make the bulkier films of the Oland era and had moved into the classic breezy detective style of the 1940s.  Though thin on budget, these films are rich in characters and Chan-isms (the wisdom Charlie frequently imparts).  CHAN IN PANAMA is often referred to as one of the best Chan films, as is WAX MUSEUM.  These films are breezy and clever, with plenty of suspicious characters, quick dialogue, lots of corpses and devious murder plots (including poison darts, gas and cigarettes).  Only slight downside is that this set does not gives us a seperate case and disc for each movie by doubling up a few.  (This is made a bit worse by having some double sided whereas two Chans would easily fit on one side.)  Don't let the fact that these are later entries deter you.  While some film series go downhill, the FOX Chans kept high standards to the very end.

3466179,3,B001ARDBXK,"Although I was looking forward to set 5 of the Chan movies, I was disappointed in the double discs. Also, what about the last 5 Chan movies Toler made? (Red dragon,Dark Alibi, Shadows Over Chinatown, Dangerous Money, The Trap. These are not in the Chanthology either.)  So in my opinion, there should be a volumne 6 with these.
Now.....what about the Chans with Roland Winters?? There are 6 of those movies: The Chinese Ring, Docks of New Orleans, Shanghai Chest, The Golden Eye, The Feathered Serpent, Sky Dragon. These would comprise volumne 7.  So the Chan movies are NOT complete. Roland Winters made an interesting Chan as well and should not be ignored.
Does anyone else out there know of anything about these mentioned movies and about any plans for Roland Winters????  Somebody seems to have dropped the ball on the Chans.",1229126400,,830,4.830985915492958

Absolutely fantastic transfers.  7 prime Toler chans on 4 disks is an ideal way to go... (IMHO) the best of the Chan re-issues.  ""Castle in the Desert"" and ""Dead Men Tell"" are especially gripping for the ""dangerous"" flavored Toler-Chan stories.
  I would echo the other voiced sentiments that these ""classic"" films require a certain amount of acclimation for the uninitiated.  Any true-blue mystery or plot fan won't want to miss this fine collection.",1228694400,3,542,4.8791208791208796

3466222,4,B001ARDBXK,"The ""Charlie Chan"" films, a long-running series of several dozen hour-long quickies produced from 1929-1949, is something of a cultural Rorschach test.  Many old-timers view them fondly with great nostalgia, while many Asians and Asian-Americans find them offensive, with the pseudo-Confucian detective Chan a symbol of Hollywood stereotypes.  I remember seeing the Chan films regularly on after-school and weekend television as a kid, and relishing the cheesy, B-minus flavor of the productions, which were derivative of tougher, more substantive film noir, but were also close to the cheapo serial adventures of Flash Gordon, and the like.  The clunky, workmanlike feel was a big part of the charm (and still is), a window into the entertainment industry's old-school factory-style production... Plus, it's fun to work inside a formula.

As far as the Chan character himself, well, it's true that the earlier films, starring Warner Oland (a white man, in the role of the Chinese-American Chan) had a distinctly Fu Manchu-esque, ""mysterious orientals"" feel to them, but by the time of these later films (box set Volume Five starts in 1940, with ""Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise"" and spans through to 1942's ""Castle In The Desert"") the role had been taken over by the milder, suaver Sidney Toler, who made Chan seem more ""American"" and less exotic and inscrutable. There is a good case to be made that, casting another white guy aside, this version of Detective Chan is in some small way a validation of the American melting-pot myth: at a time when Japanese-American families were being rounded up and sent to detention camps, here was an Asian character who was an actual hero.  True, the always-strained comedic schtick with Chan's inept, sexed-crazed ""Number One Son"" (and, in these later films, Number Two) could be seen as racial caricatures, but this doesn't entirely hold up. Indeed, there isn't much difference between the bumbling, blank-headed sons and that of caucasian characters such as, say, Mickey Rooney or, a decade later, Superman's pal, Jimmy Olson.

All in all, I'd say these late-edition Charlie Chan movies are mostly good, clean fun... You have to be aware of the social backdrop, but the racial overtones are not overwhelming or noxious (and to the extent that they are, this is also instructive about the popular culture of years gone by...)  At heart, these short films are simply fun, fluffy, low-budget crime stories, pop culture candyfloss that mimics the gritty feel of better crime films, but is no less enjoyable for doing so. I'm happy to watch them again, as I did years ago, and find them still pretty much as amusing as they were back then. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1223856000,2,2710,5.09009009009009

As others have stated, there are only 4 discs, and 3 are ""double-sided"". The cost of this set should have been in the mid-twenties. Amazon, you owe me ten bucks.

As for the movies, I would award 3 stars. Personally, I was a Warner Oland Fan. Sidney Toler did a fair to middling job of continuing the series, especially his early ones. However, by the end of the 20th Century Fox run, the series was obviously spent. Toler bought the rights and continued filming with Monogram, but the Chan movies had run their course and were pretty much over. After Toler died, Roland Winters took over as Chan and effectively buried an already dead body. However, the movies in this series are watchable....just not the best Chans.

UPDATE: within a couple of days of my review, Amazon updated their description that now correctly says ""4 discs"". Nevertheless, my initial one star rating stands due to their false advertising when I bought the set.

This film has two of the best unintentionally funny scenes in the whole series. Dead Men Tell was my favorite film as a child - the ghost walks to creepy music. And Rio is notable for the terrific cast of actors - Marybeth Hughes as the tipsy jealous wife is my favorite here.

3466244,5,B001ARDBXK,"FINALLY! Now we can have ""Castle in the Desert"" on DVD! This is the best Charlie Chan entry ever (5+ stars) although I do miss Mantan Moreland who is regrettably absent from this great film. Here's the low-down:

Not one of the other Charlie Chan films can touch this this 1942 Sidney Toler entry. The casting is brilliant, the acting is superior, the cinematography is dramatic and, the location is PERFECT. Imagine that! A castle in the desert! This is a poisoning case, (the Borgia family curse!), and Charlie is summoned to help solve it. He's warned from going from the moment he's invited and, of course, one of his numerous sons (not quite so goofy as some others we've seen) tags along to watch out for his dear old dad.

Dark characters are everywhere and the sub-plots are above average. Fans of Charlie Chan films will drool over this one but the average viewer can enjoy this light mystery as well. Henry Danielle co-stars in this one -- you'll recognize him from many great old mystery films but here is one of his very best:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Woman-in-Green/dp/B0000EMYI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes - The Woman in Green</a>&nbsp;-- Danielle plays the infamous and nefarious Professor Moriarty in this well-known Sherlock Holmes film. Getting back to ""Castle in the Desert,"" the desert town, old vehicles, the landscapes, the castle, (and it's creepy accoutrements) are all about the coolest things you'll ever view in a black and white old-timey mystery film.

There are SIX other great entries in this set too. The next best one (5 stars) is ""Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum,"" which is a great venue for a murder mystery. In this 1940 film, an arch-villian is hiding out and a nefarious doctor is performing plastic surgery to help him escape justice. This is a Toler entry and Number Two Son provides some comic relief.

""Charlie Chan in Panama"" (1940) doesn't exactly race with action but it's still a great story (4+ stars) and a fine Sidney Toler vehicle as well. This is an espionage mystery -- the bad faction is out to wreck the Panama Canal, messing up U.S. Navy maneuvers if it happens. Charlie is right in style with his trademark Panama hat!

Anther good one is ""Dead Man Tell"" (1941, 4 stars) where an older lady, Miss Nodbury, is scared to death by the ghost of a pirate ancestor just as she's preparing to leave for a treasure hunt. Charlie Chan investigates her family to find the culprit in this murder tale. Along with Sidney Toler, you'll see two other great old stars including George Reeves (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Superman-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000A5046K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Season</a>) and Kay Aldridge, who starred as Nyoka in an awesome Republic Pictures serial,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nyoka-and-the-Tigermen/dp/B000003NZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nyoka and the Tigermen</a>&nbsp;(a.k.a., ""Nyoka and the Lost Secrets of Hippocrates"".)

A pretty good film (3+ stars) is ""Charlie Chan in Rio,"" where Charlie (Sidney Toler) has to help out the local police by untangling a pair of murders. This one (like many others) was directed by Harry Lachman and was released in 1941.

""Murder over New York"" Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) is out to collar pre-war spies. These nefarious devils are responsible for slowing down the line in aircraft production. Filmed in 1940, this one is pretty good at 3+ stars. A piece of trivia here -- although he is uncredited, Shemp Howard (""The Three Stooges"") plays Shorty McCoy (The Canarsie Kid). Here is Shemp's best Three Stooges entry:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malice-in-the-Palace-1949/dp/B000QRIKSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malice in the Palace (1949)</a>

""Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise"" (1940) is hardly the least of these great Charlie Chan films -- I give it four stars. Here, Charlie (Sidney Toler) is on a cruise from Hawaii to San Francisco and a total of five murders take place. One of the unfortunates is Charlie's Scotland Yard pal! One of my favorite serial actors, Charles Middleton, appears in this fun mystery film. I think he was probably best known as ""Ming the Merciless"" in the great old Flash Gordon serial but he also shines as the local Sheriff (Middleton almost always played the bad guy but this was a rare exception) in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Raven/dp/B00006SFIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Raven</a>, a superb old mystery starring George Zucco.

Of course, all these films are in black-and-white and the aspect is full-frame. This is a really superb set of Charlie Chan films, the best yet in fact. I say its a steal at any price, especially for Chan fans.",1218844800,15,4941,5.603748326639893
3466245,5,B001ARDBXK,"You could almost feel the gentle trade winds of Hawaii during the 1920's in the first Charlie Chan novel by Earl Derr Biggers. Romantic and full of atmosphere, Biggers was always a great romance writer who simply incorporated mystery into his books to propel the story forward. His detective was wise and humorous, his take on American life sometimes a riot. Nothing got by Chan, however, and it was his intelligence which always brought justice in the end.

The adaptations to film lost some of the more romantic aspects of the early Chan novels, centering more on Chan as a detective, as to be expected. Enough humor and atmosphere remained, however, to propel Chan into the top tier of film detectives. Warner Oland's Chan was more refined and subtle, Sidney Toler's more outgoing and amused. Both were excellent. This set features Toler in the final ""A"" Charlie Chan mysteries before it became a ""B"" series which, while enjoyable at times, did not have the production values or stories to live up to previous pictures.

Fox liked to put Chan in exotic locations and settings. Charlie was in Panama, or on a cruise, or in Rio, one of his many offspring always in tow trying to play detective and generally getting in the way. By the time Castle in the Desert was filmed, it almost felt like a high end ""B"" rather than the classy mystery series it had been. All are great fun, however, some not having been available in studio approved fashion before. Three in particular from this set stand out.

Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum is a terrific entry and one of the most atmospheric of the original series. This one is centered around a live radio broadcast from the Museum of Crime, where notorious criminals have been immortalized in wax. Chan's second son, Jimmy (Sen Yung), is on hand to help pop solve an old crime and avoid becoming a victim himself. Jimmy accepts the challenge for his pop to appear on the Crime League's weekly broadcast to clear the name of Joe Rocke, a man Chan has long believed was unfairly executed for a crime he did not commit.

But it is Chan's suspicion that the wax museum and his invitation are tied to the recent escape of a man he helped convict of murder, prompting him to accept, arriving on a rainy night when the creepy fun begins. A botched attempt to electrocute Charlie, and the murder of his scientific rival by poison blow dart, not to mention a wax Charlie Chan, all add up to mystery fun for Charlie Chan fans. Marguerite Chapman as the young radio reporter hoping this night will be a great story and Joan Valerie as the pretty but slightly shady assistant, Lily, stand out from the rest in John Larkin's screenplay. This one's a real kick in the pants!

Charlie Chan in Rio is actually a fun and colorful remake of the very early Chan entry, The Black Camel. We get a big dose of Brazil right from the start with shots of  Rio's sunny beaches and the posh nightclub where Lola Dean (Jacqueline Dalya) sings the exotic, ""They Met in Rio,"" written by Mark Gordon and Harry Warren. Chan and his enthusiastic second son, Jimmy (Sen Yung), are there to arrest Lola for a murder which took place on Charlie's turf in Honolulu. But before Lola can slip away to marry Clark Reynolds, she is murdered, leaving Charlie and son Jimmy with a new crime to solve.

Marybeth Huges is the beautiful Joan Reynolds, who did not like Lola in the least. She had much company, however, including Grace Ellis (Cobina Wright Jr.) and an Indian mystic who may have discovered Lola's secret past. Young Jimmy, always ready to jump to the wrong conclusion, is a hoot. There is a very funny scene where Charlie discovers the real reason Jimmy has been missing math classes back home while he is under a spell. Jimmy's affections for Lola's pretty Chinese maid, Lili (Iris Wong), keeps the atmosphere light as Charlie plays a long shot in order to catch a killer.

The mystery is both fun to solve and watch. His interactions with young son Jimmy are priceless, as is his cool demeanor under pressure. Kay Linaker, Victor Jory, and Ted North round out the cast for one of the most entertaining Charlie Chan films.

Murder Over New York finds Charlie Chan knee deep in sabotage and murder at a convention for detectives. Chan's enthusiastic offspring, Jimmy (Sen Yung), arrives in New York just in time to help pop. Chan's bemusement at Jimmy is quite evident in his comment to a fellow detective regarding his involvement in previous cases. A good screenplay from Lester Ziffren and some good pacing from director Harry Lachman makes the mystery as much fun as the look on Chan's face when Jimmy solves the case every five seconds!

Flying to an annual convention of police detectives in New York, Chan meets his old friend Drake from Scotland Yard aboard the plane. Drake is now working for the military, trying to stem a rash of sabotage. Once on land, he turns up dead, the briefcase containing evidence that will help expose the man named Narvo behind it all, missing. Jimmy's nose for chemistry helps uncover a new gas called tetrogene as the method for the murder and Chan goes to work to uncover the killer of an old pal.

Donald MacBride is the New York detective, Inspector Vance, who lets Charlie guide the investigation. A pretty actress named June Preston (Joan Valerie) is missing a pearl from her necklace which turns up at the murder scene. A chemist named David Elliot (Robert Lowery) and a lovely girl named Patricia (Marjorie Weaver) trying to prove his innocence also figure into the mystery as Chan sifts through the clues. Stooge Shemp Howard has a funny bit as a fake Hindu along the way.

Charlie Chan was bright and funny, and audiences loved him. If anything, his character helped elevate and give distinction to the perspective at the time of Chan's race in general. These were fun mysteries with great appeal, so much so, that we are still watching and talking about them today. Sidney Toler happens to be my personal favorite to have portrayed the sleuth, though he was not Chinese. These films are a fabulous time at the movies for detective and mystery fans.",1216512000,62,6111,4.658627087198516
3466246,5,B001ARDBXK,"With the release of Volume Five, the great Charlie Chan series from 20th Century Fox is at last complete.  For those interested in watching these classic Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan films in their original order of release, ""Charlie Chan In Panama"" (1940) is a well crafted , tightly scripted visit to the world famous Panama Canal directed by series veteran Norman Foster.  Much of the credit for keeping the suspense high in this cautionary tale regarding the welfare of our fleet goes to the superb supporting cast to include the lovely Jean Rogers along with the very reliable Lionel Atwill and Mary Nash.  Another all star supporting cast highlights ""Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise"" (1940) featuring the great character actor Charles Middleton along with Chan series regulars Robert Lowery and Lionel Atwill with Cora Witherspoon and Leo G. Carroll.  Considered something of a rewrite of creator Earl Derr Biggers orginal story,""Charlie Chan Carries On,"" Murder Cruise manages a few surprises of its own all within the confines of a not so luxurious liner.  ""Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum"" is the third release for year (1940) with no sign of routine obvious - a tribute in part to the organized creativity of the studio system of film production.  Here credit for the shooting style of longer takes goes to one time Chan film director Lynn Shores who's theatrical approach to story telling works very well as Wax Museum is essentially a story confined to a single locale.  Starting with volume four's ""City in Darkness"", the Chan series uses as a continuing underlining theme, the growing danger of a world at war.  With the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor about one year away, ""Murder Over New York"" (1940) uses as a central theme the reality of sabotage happening even in the isolationist and still neutral confines of ""The Big Apple.""  Chan regulars Marjorie Weaver and Robert Lowery are joined by Ricardo Cortez, the great Clarence Muse, (still playing memorable roles as late as 1979's classic film, ""The Black Stallion"") and Shemp Howard of The Three Stooges fame working as a one man scam artist all help keep ""Murder Over New York"" both interesting and amusing.  In ""Dead Men Tell"" (1941), director Harry Lachman returns to the series with newcomers Truman Bradley, Ethel Griffes and post ""Gone With The Wind"" Tarleton Twin pre Superman, George Reeves among others.  Again the theme of dangerous waters in Dead Men only served to underscore the true dangers of crossing the U-Boat infested Atlantic Ocean.  ""Charlie Chan in Rio"" (1941), the last production from 20th Century Fox to feature the Chan name in the film title, is a remake of ""The Black Camel"" but as some ten years has elapsed, the freshened up story is, (IMO,) most enjoyable.  Featuring another alumnus from ""Gone With The Wind"" Victor Jory as Alfredo Marana, ""Charlie Chan in Rio"" conjures up all sorts of mind expanding experiences to help or hinder series veteran Harold Huber and Truman Bradley in a clever tale designed in part to suggest one more carnival before World War draws the country into its abyss as evidenced by Number Two Son Jimmy receiving his draft notice in the film's closing scene.  The concluding Charlie Chan movie in this series from  20th Century Fox is the mysterious ""Castle In The Desert.""  (1942)  With Number Two Son Jimmy Chan on leave from the Army, Manderley Castle beckons the Chans to the remote reaches of California's Mojave Desert as someone is trying to incriminate a member of the famous Borgia family or worse.  ""The poisoner?"" Jimmy asks.  ""She's dead.""  To which Charlie Chan answers completely dead pan, ""This lady uses a typewriter.""  And she isn't the only quirky character what with Paul Manderley, (nicely played by Douglass Dumbrille,) conducting his historical research wearing a mask to hide scars from an earlier accident or as the Mojave Wells hotel owner says he ""goes around with only half a face.""  Soon we have Ethel Griffes, described as ""stargazer"" Madame Saturnia and Henry Daniell as Watson King motoring to the isolated castle with no telephone and ..... well you get the set up.  After the release of ""Castle In The Desert"", for reasons known only to company executives, 20th Century Fox decided to give the Charlie Chan series an unlimited vacation.  By this time, Sidney Toler had secured the film rights to the character Charlie Chan and was busy shopping ideas for a new series all over Hollywood.  Two years would pass before Charlie Chan returned to the big screen - this time from Monogram Studios but that's another story for another time.  I hope you enjoy these Charlie Chan films and supplementary material as much as I do.  Many thanks to 20th Century Fox for sharing them with us again.

3466247,4,B001ARDBXK,"Sidney Toler's Chan was nothing like Warner Oland's characterization. But if the truth be told, it's Toler who comes through in the pages of Earl Derr Biggers novels, not Oland. I know because as an inveterate Oland fan, I tried very hard to see my hero in the six Chan novels but, alas, it was Toler who showed up in my mind's eyes and ears. As for the Toler films, it took Fox awhile to reposition the series to capture Toler's strengths. If Oland's Chan was like a stately mandarin, Toler's was more of a gritty, Sam Spade-like characterization.

By late 1940, Fox had tailored the scripts to suit Toler's personality and replaced the globe-trotting Oland formula (""At the Race Track,"" ""At the Olympics,"" ""On Broadway"") with a compact film noir-like mystery format that was closer stylistically to ""The Maltese Falcon"" than to ""Sherlock Holmes."" And it worked too. ""Wax Museum"" and ""Dead Men Tell"" are especially adroit little films that benefit from the Fox studio's top technicians, set and costume designers, and superb supporting cast of contract players. Even a pre-Superman George Reeves shows up in ""Dead Men Tell."" The last of the Fox Chans, ""Castle in the Desert"" ended the series on a high level of quality. Presumably, the coming of World War II cut off the overseas markets and cut deeply into the potential revenues of these films, thus ending the series.

My favorite Toler is included in the set, CHARLIE CHAN IN PANAMA. The story is surprisingly timely with spies (today we call them terrorists) plotting to blow up the Panama Canal as the U.S. Naval Fleet is going through it. Charlie is working undercover in this one as a shopkeeper but considering how well known he was supposed to be, wouldn't he stand out like a sore thumb? (Maybe the bad guys are still looking for Warner Oland) The plot takes its time to get going but the climax is as suspenseful as any of the higher-rated Chans. The killer is exceptionally well hidden and the writers exploit our subconscious biases so we keep the individual off our suspect list without even realizing it.

While the earlier Tolers of 1939 only served to emphasize that the ""real"" Charlie Chan was gone, these last entries show a successful evolution in format and are quite enjoyable if you can just let Toler be Toler, forget (albeit momentarily) about Oland, and ironically see the Chan that Earl Derr Biggers probably had in mind when he wrote his stories. I am sure (this is a pre-release review)that the print quality of these films is excellent if the short-lived Fox Movie Channel airings of a few years back were any indication - they offer stunning b/w photography when the studio system was at its peak.",1214870400,99,2680,4.759139784946236

The movies: Charlie Chan In Panama, Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise, Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum, Murder Over New York, Dead Men Tell, Castle In The Desert and Charlie Chan In Rio. These are all great movies, with several guest stars including George Reeves and Victor Jory! A set well worth the money, though they are all on double sided discs!
