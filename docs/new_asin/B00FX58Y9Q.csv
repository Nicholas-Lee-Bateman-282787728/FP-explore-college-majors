6035308,5,B00FX58Y9Q,Highly entertaining!  They need the writers of the lego shows to work on the new Star Wars movies. Hard to find as in Canada you can only get at Walmart.,1392681600,,153,4.1
6035309,5,B00FX58Y9Q,super funny - my young kids and my husband love it!  another great movie from Lego.  i definitely recommend it!,1390867200,6,111,4.5
6035310,5,B00FX58Y9Q,"Grandson loved this video! Will watch it again, along with The Yoda Chronicles,
 in the car on the way home to Florida.",1388707200,3,119,4.409090909090909
6035311,5,B00FX58Y9Q,Our family loves the Lego Star Wars series. We have a 2 year old who is obsessed and my husband and I watch them with him every night. They are cleaver and entertaining.,1388620800,3,169,4.151515151515151
6035312,5,B00FX58Y9Q,Because it was really well made. The characters were funny and the children enjoyed it. Thankful and looking for more in the future.,1388448000,,132,4.782608695652174
6035313,4,B00FX58Y9Q,My boys like Legos and starwars so this was perfect and it had two episodes so it was long. Yeah!,1388361600,,97,3.9
6035314,5,B00FX58Y9Q,My husband and I are HUGE SW fans and this has been another great addition to our collection.  We are both also huge lego kids at heart and combining the two is always a win for us.  The storyline is fun and we enjoy all the little remarks here and there that adults catch on to.  The kids loved it as well - something our whole family can watch :),1388016000,,348,3.942857142857143
6035315,5,B00FX58Y9Q,"This dvd was better the second and third time...some of the ""inside jokes"" u don't catch the first time you watch.  very enjoyable...but at wal-mart...$7.50...",1385164800,5,159,5.36
6035316,4,B00FX58Y9Q,"Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles continues the tradition of animated Lego tie-ins with the Star Wars universe started with things like The Padawan Menace and The Empire Strikes Out.  The disc includes two special episodes that aired on Cartoon Network, the Phantom Clone and Menace of the Sith.
In The Phantom Clone, Yoda is tricked into leaving the padawan class behind as he goes on a rescue mission, only to have them lose their lightsabers to General Grievous.  A plot to create Sith enhanced clones is exposed, putting all the Republic at risk. In Menace of the Clone, the only Sith clone to be created wants to become his own master and both the Sith and Jedi try to lure him to their side.
While these are the closest episodes to being something out of the Clone Wars series, these follow the earlier Lego specials both in tone and style.  There are plenty of silly things for the kids and lots of in-jokes for adults, especially those well acquainted with the Star Wars universe.  A personal favorite moment of mine was when Billy D. Williams showed up in a moment that I couldn't help but smile about.  Not to mention a hilarious appearance by Admiral Ackbar, a dig at Hayden Christensen's acting in the prequels, and ""Life Day.""
Overall the episodes themselves are great fun for the whole family.  Unfortunately the disc release leaves a lot to be desired.  The DVD includes only the episodes, no special features to speak of.  There are language tracks and subtitles, but nothing else.  If you're just interested in watching or re-watching the episodes, this DVD is a nice pickup, but hopefully with the third installment of The Yoda Chronicles, Attack of the Jedi, we'll get a better release with more features.
At the time of the writing of this review, this DVD is a Walmart Exclusive DVD release.",1384905600,19,1814,4.715189873417722

6035320,4,B00FX58Y9Q,"Cute mix-up of Star Wars characters and locations (in Lego format of course) involving a rebellious clone named Jek-14. Plenty of goofy humor and a story that doesn't take itself too seriously (e.g. ships with clearly marked spots to be easily destroyed.)  I'm glad to hear Anthony Daniel's as C3P0, which adds a slight degree of authenticity to all the silliness.",1455148800,,364,4.967213114754099

6035326,5,B00FX58Y9Q,"Entertaining for ""children of ages!""  I find Lego humor to be similar to the Muppets: gentle, self-knowing, and working on a level for younger and older viewers simultaneously.  If you buy this DVD, make sure you get the NEW Yoda Chronicles to go with it.",1443312000,,255,4.644444444444445

6035328,3,B00FX58Y9Q,"I had mistakenly thought this disc had four or more show ""episodes"" lasting thirty minutes each. There are only two episodes, each lasting about 22 minutes (44 minutes total). That's not a bad thing per se, but I had purchased this for my children to watch on a long road trip. They enjoyed it for what it was, and the way the shows lightly poke fun at Star Wars made my husband and I laugh, too.",1440460800,3,396,4.223684210526316

6035376,4,B00FX58Y9Q,"The first lego video Star Wars was hilarious (I watched it with my now 4 year old grandson and we both laughed until our sides hurt). This one, following the Padawan Menace, was entertaining and mildly humorous, but had a lot of action in it. The story is deeper, but I prefer upping the humor for adults! (Hey it's not supposed to be for me). My grandson liked it and followed it closer than before. Some of the scenes are based on the first three Star Wars movies which my daughter doesn't yet want my grandson to see...hence not too explainable to the grandson. These lego videos are still amazing and I thank the producers and all those who contributed to them are geniuses in entertaining grandsons and grandfathers alike.",1400025600,3,727,4.6

But for the price we DO LOVE the fact that you get 2 episodes.  The last two releases also had mini figures, but not this one.  We knew that when we bought it, but I do wish they had included one.
