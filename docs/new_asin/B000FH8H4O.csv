8122526,5,B000FH8H4O,"This has become an excellent way for my grandsons to learn of this wonderful classic by Mark Twain. It's probably the most requested video when I watch them. For an inexpensive product -- which I think is only sensible, considering the ""care"" they give things :) -- this is a great production with good picture quality; animation is fast and identifiable, and color is bright.  I would love to find all the classics done with this quality and at this price!",1306627200,2,457,4.6419753086419755
8122527,3,B000FH8H4O,"A mischievous Missouri boy named Tom befriends a wanderer named Huck, and the pair go in search of pirate treasure, take on the villainous ""Injun Joe,"" and help their friend Jim travel downriver to visit his ailing mother in the hospital.

I remember watching Japanese ""Anime"" versions of classic literature and fairytales on Nickelodeon growing up, and one I always wanted to see again was an interpretation of Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" This, I'm pretty sure, is not the version I remember watching (I think I had seen the `76 Anime version). For this version from Enoki Films (from around `94 or `95, I believe), the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are condensed into one film, despite the original title being ""The Adventures of Huck Finn,"" (or ""Huckleberry Finn Monogatari,"" actually). All the serious stuff has been taken out, too. No Muff Potter on trial for murder, no racism or slavery of any kind to deal with, and even Huck's pa isn't as bad as you may have remembered (though he's still a baddie). In fact, Huck's story suffers the most from this re-imagining. His trip downriver with Jim is pretty much uneventful, aside from some leg injuries, being reunited with Tom, and briefly losing Jim in a twister. We do meet Becky Thatcher, who gets lost in the caves with Tom, and the Widow Douglas, who is taking care of Jim while his mother is in the hospital, and who takes Huck in to live with her and a lovely young lady whose identity I'm not really sure of. Jim is a child in this animated version, just as in the live-action ""Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" from 1938. Bottom-line, this is Huck and Tom for kids, much like the 1980's TV movie, ""Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn."" It's fun enough for those who love the characters more for their sense of adventure than their stories' serious subject matter. It's a bargain for those Tom and Huck fanatics like me who find this DVD in the kids' dollar section at the local retail store.",1149984000,,2020,4.674157303370786
