4397487,5,B004KPD1IO,"I saw this movie in the theater. Dont expect it to be original, but then again don't expect any new movie to be original nowadays. Despite its familiar story-line, ""What If"" is a great movie. Its one of the few Christian movies that actually has a good amount of humor in it. Whereas, most Christian movies are so dramatic, they can leave a person feeling depressed, even if it has a good message. If only more movies were like ""What If"".",1297900800,13,438,4.419753086419753

4397506,5,B004KPD1IO,"If you are human, have a heart and love love, (the way only our Abba Father could have Authored), then you cannot help but be touched and changed by this movie. Yeah, there are few things I would have liked to see differently, (as some have also commented on), namely a little more modest attire, (when a woman is bringing it, (so to speak), it is SO MUCH more attractive when she keeps it covered like a lady after God's heart than letting any of it show for the whole world to see. It's that whole mystery thing, if you want to think of it that way.  I so wish they would/could understand that.)  Nevertheless, for a somewhat mainstream Christian movie, it was definitely adequate for promoting The Kingdom of God and the Power of The Word.  They even got the J-Word in there. (Jesus, of course)  So kudos for THAT!  I found it to be extremely well and cleverly written with a number of scenes being both touching and very funny.  But what slays me EVERY SINGLE time I watch it, (which I could never get sick of), is the end.  How the writers and director bring it all around was not only magical story telling, it causes me, (tough guy with five children), to weep without fail.  I'm good with that.  So, if you haven't figured out yet, I highly recommend the movie.  Blessings in Christ. :)",1519516800,,1294,4.376569037656904

Instead it is an amazing, inspiring movie, about a man who thinks he has it all (great career, tons of money, a brand new expensive car).  Given an alternate life - for a week or two - that shows him what he missed out on (a life that is rich with a family and faith instead of all the empty wealth; he had before) really changes his whole direction - and that is after walking away from the Christian faith and his christian girl friend; for 15 years.  A very long 15 years - I might add - that causes his girlfriend to question her own faith and to work through a lot of anger; that she gets toward him and God.  It is just an awesome movie about turning your life around, to follow God's plan.  And it is done so well, with Kevin Sorbo, Kristy Swanson and John Ratzenberger.  As I tried to indicate - in the beginning - I am not a fan of super preachy Christian movies.  It just isn't necessary when great movies, like this one, are out there.

4397682,1,B004KPD1IO,"A previous review asked ""what if all faith-based films were this good?"". The answer to that is easy - it would be easy to spot the drivel from a mile off.

This book starts with a young man saying goodbye to his fiancee because he's going away on a business placement for some months. She pleads with him not to go, although the bench beside the bus as boarding is announced isn't the best time to be doing that. So off he goes.

Then the film moves forward 15 years and he's the big shot banker with lots of money who does business by nailing people to the ground to maximise his own profits. Not an entirely pleasant piece of work, it has to be said.

A somewhat contrived (and not entirely realistic) situation brings him face to face with a tow-truck driver who shows him how his life might have turned out, had he chosen a different path 15 years previously. The idea is that he gets to see what might have been, and presumably decide whether or not to go back to his previous life.

I'll try and avoid posting spoilers even though the whole thing is depressingly predictable here, and about the only twist in the film relates to the decision whether or not to go back to his real life. If you make it that far without falling asleep you're on the home stretch, although having made it past the one twist (and it's not a particularly big twist) the finishing stretch is depressingly predictable.

I wasn't honestly sure I'd make it through the whole movie without giving up. Having made it to the end I wish I hadn't bothered. This is the kind of drivel that people within the church rave over, as if thousands of non-Christians will get on their knees and repent just because they saw a fictitious douchebag decide to change his ways in a totally contrived setting. At the same time those aforementioned non-Christians will continue to mock the church, at least in part because we expect them to respond to stuff like this with anything other than utter contempt.

There's only so much that can be done with a ""faith-based film"", although perhaps the solution to the problem is contained with the description of the problem. I really wish Christian film-makers would produce films that express the Christian faith, but if this is the best they can do they'd really be better off not bothering. In the days I was hostile to the church this is the sort of movie that would just have turned into ammunition to fire back at those who presented it to me.",1441497600,,2455,4.480984340044743

4397702,5,B004KPD1IO,"Ben Walker (Kevin Sorbo) isn't looking for a second chance. He thinks he did alright the first time around. He's wealthy, the boy wonder of a powerful corporation, and has a gorgeous fianc' who adores him (or at least his bank account). So when a scruffy old guy called Mike who claims to be an angel (John Ratzenberger) comes along and offers Ben a second chance, Ben turns him down cold. Turns out that Ben doesn't really have a choice and when he comes to, Ben finds himself back in the small town he worked so hard to escape, married to his old girlfriend Wendy (Kristy Swanson) and apparently the father of two daughters. To his chagrin, Ben discovers this version of himself is anything but wealthy, and to top it off, he finds out that he's now a ministerjust as he's introduced to his new church. Could things possibly get any worse? Or will Ben discover his real life isn't all he thought it was? What If is great little film about the choices we make and the fact that there is indeed a plan for everyone's life. Ben Walker resists this idea, and angrily tells Mike that life has no point: you live, you die, that's it. But Ben didn't always think like that. Fifteen years ago he was on the brink of joining the seminary, and he and Wendy were preparing for a life of ministry together. But Ben left Wendy at the bus station one day and never went back. That day he didn't only break a promise to Wendy, but to God as well.

Kevin Sorbo is absolutely terrific as Ben, and wonderfully conveys the hapless protagonist's gradual transformation from oily and arrogant businessman to frustrated refugee in an alternate timeline to loving father, husband, and pastor. Sorbo has always been a charismatic actor, and his role in What If may be the highlight of his career. Kristy Swanson is likewise great as Ben's loving but confused wife Wendy, and John Ratzenberger imbues his angelic character with personality and down-to-earth sincerity. The script doesn't shy away from religious themes and tackles some weighty ones, but never becomes preachy or clich.

There are a lot of spiritual films out there during the Christmas season each year, but few of them will hold a candle to What If.",1437955200,,2194,4.608695652173913

4397826,4,B004KPD1IO,"The movie concept was derived from another movie ""The Family Man"" with Nicholas Cage which was also a very good movie. However, ""What If"" doesn't change the storyline at all which is a mystery, they just put a little Jesus in it and actual made an even better movie. If you have seen both movies you will have a serious deja vu episode because the storylines are exactly the same. Man and woman are at a bus terminal/airport and have the option to either stay in love and make a life together or the guy in this matter has the option to follow his dream career. In both movies the guy chooses business over love and in both movies the guy becomes ultra successful and is in love with his money and material things. In both movies, a guy (angel) interrupts the guys life out of the blue and sends him in an alternate existence of what could have been. Both movies the guy is thrown into a domestic life of living pay check to pay check and goes from single to a husband with two girls. In both movies, the guy falls in love with his new life and is forced to go back to his old life and then finds his true love and relives the family life in reality. Same storyline (lol). If you haven't seen either movie I suggest you watch both, it's amazing how just adding Jesus to the story can really make it that much more happier and fulfilling.",1411344000,3,1337,4.247058823529412

4397833,4,B004KPD1IO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this family friendly movie!  It poses the question what if you life did move in in a different
direction vs what would have happened if your kept on your original path God intended for you. It gives
you the scenario of a Christian man who moved a way from a country town with the intention of it being temporary
and returning home to continue his life with his girlfriend and the path they thought God was directing them.
What happened was that he stayed in the city he went on to become a successful business man with a the trappings
of materialism that his success could buy and he thought he was happy!  Enter an Angel sent by God to show him what if..
he had returned to the country town he left and his Christian Girlfiend and fulfilled the plans he once had.
This movie is similar to ""The Family Man"" (Nicholas Cage) but from a Christian perspective and poses the question what if..
you walked the path God called you to walk how would your life be different?
This movie does get you to question your direction and what matters to you the most and indeed how your life effects others
around you. The story while familiar to many, does get you to think What If...............",1410480000,2,1201,4.429864253393665

Jimmy Stewart found out what Sorbo finds out in this movie--our interactions with others can help make this life a better/nicer/more meaningful place for just about everyone we come into contact with especially, if we have the right motives.

In this film, the main character is given the opportunity to see what his family and life would have been like if he had made a different decision earlier in his life.

Kevin Sorbo does well in this role and the supporting cast works nicely. The little actress playing his younger daughter is pretty adorable.

4397943,5,B004KPD1IO,"This is a fairly well-made movie that genuinely is interesting, entertaining, and meaningful.

While browsing the video shelf of a local store, I picked this movie up on a couple of different occasions to read what it was about, and each time quickly put it back thinking ""this looks over the top ridiculous"" and thinking I would find it theologically offensive. But then I happened to catch the last 30 minutes of it while over at a friend's house and it genuinely looked like a good movie, so I bought it and watched the whole thing. And I was NOT disappointed.

Basically the main character earlier in his life runs from God and His call on his life, as well as his girlfriend. Later on, God (working through an angel) shows him what his life would have looked like if he had chosen differently (i.e. correctly). The guy actually starts living this ""alternate reality"". Eventually, after learning what he needs to learn, he goes back to his true real life with fresh perspective and a fresh start.

Theologically, yes there are of course some ""issues"" with this movie. I don't believe God has people live out these alternate lives nor do I think the angel portrayal is spot-on, etc. However, the movie just uses this ""what if"" plotline really as a showcase of its greater message. In other words, I don't think it is intended to be taken dogmatically but as a ""device"" to make the point. There's a relatively good salvation scene (when compared to several other ""Christian/faith-based movies"") and there are loads of good messages in this movie.

I can say without reservation that I left this movie feeling hopeful, encouraged, and spurred-on towards making my own life count in what really matters.

The acting and production quality was relatively decent. I would put it in the ""really good made-for-t.v. movie"" category.

All things considered, this is a good movie, but if you're watching with kids or brand-new-believers you might want to address some of the theological issues. After all, you don't want your 10-year-old thinking that God might whisk them off to live an alternate life, do you? This movie can set the stage for some interesting discussions regarding our choices, God's will for our lives, whether God is usually as ""pushy"" as He comes across in the movie in pushing the guy back to where He needs to be as opposed to gently nudging etc. Other discussion points could be the foolishness of waiting to the last minute to accept the Lord (as occurs with a character in the movie), what the family unit is to ideally look like - the importance of a united family, the importance of going forward into a bright future regardless of your past - that while unable to change your past choices, you can have a ""new beginning"" and go forward NOW with Jesus, and much more.

4397945,5,B004KPD1IO,"I've seen some people knocking the acting ability of Kevin Sorbo, the star of this movie. I don't understand their low opinion of his work. I thought this movie had some good acting, especially Kristy Swanson and Kevin. John Ratzenberger always produces a character role with his special panache. I thought the story line was interesting, although one reviewer complained it was a copycat version of a movie called Family Man. Since I never saw that flick, this plot was new to me and I found it compelling. Others complained about the theology and argued that God doesn't work in this manner. Of course He doesn't give us a second chance to go back and sample the fork in the road that we spurned and choose the one we prefer. The point of the movie was not to teach how God moves with His people. The point was that if we are not careful and we make the wrong choice (most likely done with consulting God) when we come to a crossroads, we could regret it the rest of our lives. This man could have had riches, a status symbol trophy wife, and a prestigious career.  But if he had those things he couldn't have a life where he depended on God for finances, a lovely wife who truly loved and supported him, and a honorable career. This movie showed what is truly valuable in life and entertained us while it did it. I've seen it twice now. I suggest you give it chance.",1361664000,,1369,4.389763779527559

Very much like 'It's A Wonderful Life' but the characters seemed more like everyday people, the kind of people that you grew up with, or lived next door, at least his life as a preacher.  And he real stuck his foot into some difficult situations, just as we have done, too many times.  The way that God let him work and think it out without too much help from his angel was all too real, though the results were startling.  This is a great film to use for witnessing to people that take their faith and God for granted.  It might make some people think about what God means to them, and is their faith too small?

You know, that major fork-in-the-road point in your life when you had to decide between path A or path B? You took B, but what would your life had been like had you taken A?

In ""What If...,"" Kevin Sorbo, plays Ben, a wealthy, successful, corporate big-wig who gets to experience what his life would have been like had he not left his girlfriend, Wendy (played by Kristy Swanson), and pursued his ""Godly"" calling to be a pastor.

It reminded me of the Nicolas Cage movie ""The Family Man"" with a ""Touched By An Angel"" feel.

A few months turns into 15 years and Ben has changed his entire life. His plans for becoming a minister and marrying Wendy changed to how much money can he make being a money hungry investment banker. When an angel comes to Earth and shows Ben what is life could have been like if he stayed on his original plan Ben has a choice to make. Not to cause an argument here but to me most of the faith based movies that come out are very cheesy and unbelievable. Movies like ""5th Quarter"", ""Courage"" and even ""The Blind Side"" to me are not that good mainly because there seems to be no real substance. Those movies are...if this doesn't happen then this can't...next scene everything works out perfect. Like in ""Blind Side"" when the family is told that if Michael doesn't pass this next test he will not be able to play, and then the very next scene is him saying I passed the test. This movie is the exception. While it does have it's cheesiness and is predictable it has something the other movies didn't...a real character facing real decisions. The only way to describe this movie is that it's very much like ""It's a wonderful life"" but with more God. To see Kevin Sorbo in a movie like this is strange at first but he does a great job.

He adds the perfect amount of comedy when called for.  My kids like Debby Ryan (from Disney Channel fame) and she played the perfect fed up teenager.

4398001,5,B004KPD1IO,"Since we do not have broadcast telly here, we like to indulge in a good movie in the evening, especially now that it gets so dark so early! And choosing a movie is easy as ex-RAF fly boy and I share a liking for the old movies or 'Family' movies (I let him enjoy Scifi's all by himself). We tend to shy away from anything with expletives or violence as we prefer to be 'entertained' not offended or scared out of our wits!
Included on our list for i.e., 'The Blind Side', a warm hearted story, perfect for family viewing and best of all, based on a true story! So far, I have seen it twice and I love it!

Years ago our then teenager son begged to see a series called 'Hercules: The Incredible Journeys' and the name Kevin Sorbo was first spoken in our household.
As a Christian this well known actor is nothing like his fellows Hollywood actors. A good model for today's youths, he will not disappoint concerned parents! His acting career proves he remains a great entertainer!

Whilst visiting our daughter a few days ago and enjoying her large flat screen telly (!) I discovered one of Kevin Sorbo's latest movies called 'What If'' (see also description above) and I could not wait to show it to my husband (huh...on our 27"" old telly - no worries, it's at least a colour one!). The best part? Mum (yes me!) got to introduce her son to one of Kevin Sorbo's latest movies as we all sat down to watch it!

This is a wonderful story of a successful man who is given a second chance when he finds the courage to face the decisions he made and the ones he could have made and finally follow God's path.
I was struck by the emotional performance of the actors, their faith alive and strong for all of us to witness.
It is a story which reaches out and grabs you! This is a movie about discovering what truly matters even if you are not a Christian!
Unlike the Hollywood epic movies, it is not ascetic. 'Ben Walker' is a man who identifies what he could have had when he realizes the treasure of having a family who loves you no matter what!

In a recent interview Kevin Sorbo said: 'A lot of the faith-based movies in the past have always been shot sort of cheesy, kinda soap opera in a way. This movie isn't like that at all. I don't look at it as a Christian movie per se. It's a movie about redemption. ... We all have what ifs in our life. ... This movie is sort of a guiding light to show people that no matter where you are, no matter how upset or disappointed or frustrated you are in your life, if you want to change, you can change your life'.

In 'What If' you will enjoy a great performance, a story of redemption and even have a few chuckles for 'Ben Walker' as a preacher is unlike any I ever met, never mind the Angel who looks like a mechanic!

I give it 5 stars!

Note: An other movie (also starring Kevin Sorbo) added to our list: 'Soul Surfer'!

4398015,5,B004KPD1IO,"WHAT IF is a great Christian movie, and almost an exact retelling of the Nicholas Cage film, FAMILY MAN. But, that's a good thing because the premise creates a great story.

The movie opens with Ben Walker leaving his girlfriend Wendy (Kevin Sorbo and Kristy Swanson, or Hercules and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with promises of returning in a few months to continue their relationship. But, Ben never returns and the movie cuts away to 15 years in the future when Ben is a successful businessman focused only on money and material success. He finds out Wendy is in town for a missionary fundraiser, and sends a check, but doesn't have time to go himself. An angel (John Ratzenburger) has other plans, and soon takes Ben to a world where he actually married Wendy and had two girls (one is Debbie Ryan from Suite Life on Deck). Ben has no clue about what to do in this new life where he faces the responsibility of being a father, a husband, and a pastor.

While obvious this is a low budget film, it is quite enjoyable (if a bit long). There is a lot of humor in Ben's attempt to be a pastor, especially when counseling a couple for marriage. This movie covers in all, including a conversion scene. I love the message in the movie, but this same message may seem contrived to the jaded general public. But, for the budget, this movie has good acting and high production values.

But, this movie is what it is. Cries for more movies to be made like this are going to fall on deaf ears. This isn't a mass market movie, but one for Christians to enjoy and use to minister to others in their own home or at church.",1314403200,2,1609,4.39261744966443

4398024,5,B004KPD1IO,"This was a real pleasant discovery.

It's a Christian movie, but don't let that put you off. It doesn't thrust anything down your throat or come off as preachy. You don't need to be religious or even Christian to appreciate the message. It's really about discovering what truly matters in life.

Often movies with a message are too obvious: you know they're trying to tell you what to feel, and as a result you don't feel anything much at all, except maybe bored and irritated. At the beginning of this movie there was one moment where I felt a sick sinking feeling, a sort of lonely emptiness inside, when I saw the main character talking about his life and his money and all that - it really made me FEEL how empty and worthless those things are, and it surprised me a lot that I felt that way because it's quite unusual to feel such a strong emotion from a movie, especially so early on.

It was fun imagining trying out a what if? in your life. Who hasn't wondered what if? about some of the choices they've made. There was humour too - not slapstick, just subtle make-you-smile moments. But that didn't spoil the drama either; rather it kept it light enough not to get too sad at the difficult parts.

I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It kept me thinking it about it for a long time afterwards, and it really did get its message across to me without feeling like I'd been sledgehammered... and I hate bing preached at! I'm not a Christian, but this wasn't a try-to-convert-you movie. It just makes you think about your priorities in life.",1309392000,26,1561,4.4475524475524475

What If... is the perfect blend of joy, laughter and tears with a wonderful, unforgettable ending!

What If... is going to be a timeless classic and is suitable for all ages.  There is a message that is woven into the script that God loves each of us and that He has a purpose for our lives.

I have a background in media and from a technical standpoint, the lighting, the camera and the directing were excellent, no details were missed.

We need more movies like What If... with excellent values.  Values that bring people together, values that give a deeper meaning to life.

Excellent job Dallas! I look forward to watching it
for years to come and I will keep watch for any other movies you produce...

In the vein of ""The Family Man,"" this movie has a solid, but not preachy, Christian message.

The script is well written and the acting is superb--things not always found in Christian family movies. This movie will have you asking yourself ""What if?""",1306368000,,453,4.8076923076923075

There was only one small scene where suspending disbelief was difficult, but the humor was worth it. The message will hold you.",1305504000,,460,5.065789473684211

4398040,5,B004KPD1IO,"When I first came read the storyline for What If, I couldn't wait for it to be released. I wasn't disappointed. This movie is dotted with humor among the more serious issues. The main character, Ben, is shown what could have happened had he followed God's calling on his life. Instead of doing so, however, Ben took an alternative route. That alternative route helped him to become a selfish, greedy, self-centered man.

When Ben is shown what could have happened had he followed God's call, at first, he is taken by surprise, which lends many laughable moments. After all, this life he could have had is completely opposite than the life he leads. Instead of being a wealthy businessman, he is now a pastor, struggling to get by on a meager income. Instead of driving a fancy sportscar, Ben now drives a minivan. Instead of being engaged to an equally selfish woman, he is now married to a sweet and giving wife. Instead of having no children and only having to think of himself, Ben is now the father of two daughters.

This movie is full of wonderful discussion questions, the main one being the importance of realizing that God has a calling and plan for each of our lives (Jeremiah 29:11).  We are here to bring glory to His name and to spread the word about the hope that is found in Jesus Christ.

I would highly recommend this movie for all ages, although younger children may not completely understand the plot. I have added this movie to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.",1304899200,,1499,4.602996254681648

Following on the same theme as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Family Man"", Ben Walker (Kevin Sorbo) is suddenly plucked out of his high profile life and deposited into ""the one that could have been"" by Mike (John Ratzenberger), an angel turned auto mechanic.  Ben's struggle is clearly depicted; and although the transition from one optic to its polar opposite occurred at a rather lightening speed, the process was real and believably sequenced.  The screenplay is skillful, acting warm and genuine, and the sets are well designed.  Well done!",1304294400,,602,4.99

4398043,2,B004KPD1IO,"I had many issues with this movie but the main one was the way God essentially forced his way into this guy's life.  What was so wrong about his life in the first place?  That he valued material things that his fiance did?  He said he was happy in his life and it showed.  He wasn't having problems with his fiance, he wasn't having issues with being empty, with wanting kids he didn't have, it wasn't as if he hated his job, etc.  As you read this you might think that I materialistic - not even close.  What I am saying is that he is going along happy as can be then he is forced into a city he didn't intend on being in.  ***SPOILER ALERT - having his car break down and then being knocked out and taken into a family that was NOT his is ridiculous.  He repeatedly says he wants to leave and attempts to do so - but God continues to keep him in a prison until he totally surrenders.  So, the condition of his release is to surrender?  As a Christian I am appalled by a movie that thinks God is about imprisoning us until we relent.  We are the ones that build our own prisons - God does not force us to love him nor would he force us in this way.  That we may be shown the folly of our way is one thing, but this?

Then he goes back to his firm where he has learned nothing.  Where all week no one has known him yet he expects to walk into it and for everyone to remember him.  Is he really that stupid?  Also, a man that hadn't preached a single day in his life on the second week hits a home run with the congregation.

I agree with the other reviewer that Family Man was a much better movie.",1304121600,9,1597,3.9716981132075473

4398049,5,B004KPD1IO,"Most of the ""Christian"" movies I have seen are usually lacking in production, post production, acting, story, and so on.  Some are so ""over the top"" that they come off as ""cheesy.""  I've yet to see a ""Christian"" movie that seems remotely close to the believers I know, nor do they represent the everyday church lives I see around in my congregation.

With ""What If . . ."" I was pleasently surprised. It actually managed to portray church people as normal, human, saved by grace people.  The acting, story, and production were superior to any of the other Christian movies I've seen. I intend to get the license so that I can show this to my church: The first movie I've felt worth my congregation seeing.

When I finished it, I was so glad I didn't pay money to see it in a theatre. It is completely predictable(not nearly as good as Family Man).  Now, I think a lot of Christian movies are cheesy but still enjoyable.  Not this one, sorry.  And also what constitutes a Christian movie?  clean? moral? or a gospel message that is Biblical?  This one passes on the first two but the Gospel message is lacking if not completely missing. Definitely a social gospel if anything.  In my opinion, if the message of Christ is not present then don't call it Christian.  Call it family-friendly.  I'm still hopeful that someone will put out a decent Christian movie with a Gospel message that is quality and entertaining.  Still waiting.

His performance is truly inspiring and you find yourself,as one reviewer put it,rooting for things to work out for Ben Walker. I loved John Ratzenberger's smartalec angel,who guides Ben on his""What If""journey. He brought a lot of humor to the role,which angels don't normally have. Kristy Swanson was wonderful as Wendy,Ben's wife,who stands by him even when she doesn't understand what's going on with him. I recommend you watch this with your family-you will be touched!

4398053,5,B004KPD1IO,"After reading the cover of the DVD box, I thought, ""hey, this is just a 'Family Man' remake.""

I like Kevin Sorbo; so, I watched it anyway.

Wow!  While the plots are similar, this movie is about ten times better than Family Man.

Kevin Sorbo gives a stunning performance as a man, Ben Walker, that is re-looking his life.

The angel, John Ratzenberger, is absolutely brilliant.  His character makes sense.  He acts as you would expect an angel to act.  He also brings some humor to the role.

Kristy Swanson does an excellent job as Ben Walker's wife.  She plays a strong character that directs Ben back onto the proper path.  Kristy Swanson plays the wife that you want Ben Walker to get together with at the end of the story.

There is real substance to this movie.  The characters are engaging.  The story is riveting.  I challenge anyone who has ever been in a serious relationship to get through this film without tearing up at several of the critical points.

Also, I found myself rooting for Sorbo's character.  Yes, Ben Walker is definitely a self-centered jerk at the beginning of the film, but Sorbo breathes so much life into the role that you really want things to work out for him.  (Contrast that with Family Man where you would not really have minded if things did not work out for the Cage character.)

Finally, there is some deeper meaning to this story.  Sorbo plays a man who has lost his faith and his way, and his way back involves refinding his faith.

As a bonus, all this is done without violence or without the need to introduce racial stereotypes or foul language.

I was extremely impressed with Kevin Sorbo, and I will look for his future performances.

Nicely done!

Watch this movie and buy copies for gifts.  It is that good!

4398057,5,B004KPD1IO,"Perhaps the fastest growing classification of movies, faith-based films have a tendency to sacrifice production value for message.

With ""What If..."", Dallas Jenkins manages to give audiences an aesthetically beautiful film with wonderful performances on both sides of the camera.  The movie feels like a mid-budget Hollywood release, a remarkable feat considering the low budget and tight shooting schedule.  Kevin Sorbo has a great presence throughout, and Kristy Swanson, still beautiful as ever, shows off her dramatic chops.  And John Ratzenberger's performance is angelic, in a good-old-boy way.

Still, great direction and performances don't make a great movie unless the story matches.  Thankfully, the story of ""What If..."", albeit somewhat recycled, is outstanding.  Living a life of luxury and power, Ben Walker (Sorbo) is chosen by God to receive a glimpse of what his life could have been had he made a different decision 15 years earlier.  The bulk of the movie is spent in Ben's alternate reality where he learns the true riches of life.

""What If..."" doesn't hide the fact that it's a Christian movie.  Still, it doesn't hurl religion at the audience with reckless abandon.  In other words, it's a movie that even non-Christians can and should enjoy.  Without sex, violence, or language concerns, it's perfectly suited for all ages.

Raising the bar for faith-based films, ""What If..."" is hopefully the start to higher standards for movies delivering messages of the Highest Standard.

Creator is not found in the pagan Christian Church,  nor does He authorize any religion or spiritual leader to lead anyone in any aspect of that life He purposed for each individual He conceived.  His Original Scripture has often suffered the mangling of His message by religious people determined that their own agenda of gaining power and possessions from people they mislead to believe these greedy people have spiritual Truth and right to speak in place of Creator deserve their possessions and respect.
