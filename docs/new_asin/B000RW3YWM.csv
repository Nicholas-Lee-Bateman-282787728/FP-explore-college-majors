8202730,4,B000RW3YWM,"While checking out the wrestling DVD selection at my local Best Buy I came across a box set of four lucha libre wrestling dvds being sold for around $15.00.  What a deal, how could I go wrong I thought to myself and gladly spent 15 hard-earned dollars.  This dvd happened to be included in the set.

Copa de Lucha is a NWA promotion (yep, the NWA is still alive and kicking) that consists of a tag-team tournament feature 4 teams from various countries (Mexico, USA, Canada, and Japan).  Ironically, the team representing Japan actually features, as the announcers point out, two guys wearing masks not from Japan (or China or Korea or anywhere near the orient for that matter)- one from England and the other one from Latin America (the land of the rising sun must have been proud).  A second moment of irony is that team USA (Joey Ryan and Karl ""Machine Gun"" Anderson) are actually heels here despite the fact that the tournament is taking place in Las Vegas.  This is due to the fact that most of the crowd is Mexican (FYI - it's worth the price alone to see Anderson and Ryan infuriate the crowd with their antics).  In addition to the 3 tournament matches, you get a couple of tag and single matches from the show.

The wrestling is pretty bad and much of it is of the lucha libre genre (makes sense since most of the crowd is Mexican).  Even the guys you would expect to deliver a good show (Colt Cabana, Franki Kazarian, Adam Pearce, etc...) more or less phone it in.  That's not even counting the train wreck tag match featuring 4 of the ""older"" masked wrestlers or the match that features a visibly injured Konnan (who makes the Wrestlemania 25's version of ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka look like Jack Evans).

That's not to say this dvd is not worth your time - it is a fun in an old school sort of way.  The heels are totally over the top and the matches are, for the most part, mercifully quick.  The announcers (their names escape me) kept me entertained with some one liners here and there while doing a, shockingly, decent job calling the action.  There is a nice crowd on hand (a couple of thousand) who seem to be enjoying themselves.  One of my favorite parts was watching them litter the ring with garbage after Ryan and Anderson do their thing (seriously - I don't think I have ever seen two heels get over quicker or more effectively or make me laugh quite as hard as this).  Finally, the cover on the DVD looks like it is for a 1960's horror movie - how can you beat that?

Overall, this really isn't a bad buy if you can find it cheap.  The wrestling is not great at all, but you will be entertained.",1239321600,2,2617,4.394190871369295
8202731,2,B000RW3YWM,"I love lucha libre, I love wrestling and I love a majority of the wrestlers on this show yet overall I have to say I was not particularly impressed.

While there were some very fun moments on this disc such as Joey Ryan and Karl Anderson's awesome heel antics and some great workers such as Hijo Del Santo and Colt Cabana, there were also some real let downs on this show.

One of the most disappointing things I found about this DVD is that it clearly did not deliver what it promised. It listed L.A. Park as being one of the wrestlers on the show, but instead Super Parka (his similarly attired but decrepid and less entertaining uncle) was the man in the skeleton suit. Surely NWA Pro knows who they are paying to work their shows, so why not be honest with the fans? Dishonesty is not good business and as much as I want to support NWA Pro this type of thing really put me off wanting to buy any more of their merchandise.

Apart from this there were several other lowlights, such as a visibly injured Konnan limping out to the ring and stinking up the joint. Before the match even started Konnan could not walk and was clearly in no  condition to wrestle yet was given far more to do in his tag match than he was capable of. The other three men worked their butts off, but it's hard to get a good match out of a cripple.

Even the Colt Cabana match was bad, since he was put in the ring with a selection of some of the world's least exciting roid-monsters. Colt did what he could but I don't think anyone could have made this a good match.

For me the overall theme of this show was wasted chances. With the group of workers on the show this could have been so much more, but by teaming up the good workers with the bad the overall quality of the show was quite average.

However one thing I really enjoyed was the atmosphere of the show. It felt bigger than an indy and had a good crowd in which really helped. Children in lucha masks, a large Hispanic crowd who ate up the racist heel stylings of Anderson and Ryan, the overall feeling of this show was  real wrestling. Not the overly polished, sexually explicit, catch-phrase laden and playboy model infused WWE sports entertainment but fun, good old fashioned grappling.

If NWA Pro are able to start telling their fans the truth, and focusing a little more on match quality then I will be very excited to see future shows. If not, then NWA Pro will be just another short lived promotion that nobody will remember in two years time.",1207958400,,2491,4.328326180257511
8202732,5,B000RW3YWM,"All the props in the world must go to the National Wrestling Alliance. After struggling for years to find an indentity in a landscape where independent promoters matter very little, the revamped NWA has found a new path through a great, old-school concept; a product that is truly Professional Wrestling.

Such a one-night, tag-team tournaments are popular in promotions outside of North America and the featured talent/styles in this event - which took place in Las Vegas - are from the U.S., Mexico, Japan and Canada, with special emphasis on the legendary Lucha Libre mat science.

El Hijo Del Santo, Rey Misterio, Sr., Konnan, Sean Waltman and Black Tiger are the featured performers in an evening of pure entertainment, with the teams aiming for the first Copa de Lucha championship. This DVD is outstanding from the first bell to the final match, when the champs - and fans - have their hands raised in victory.",1201305600,2,917,4.909677419354839
8202733,3,B000RW3YWM,"Fun lucha and American style pro-wrestling video in general.  I found it for a very low price new at a local grocery store.  When El Hijo del Santo is featured, you have to get it if you are a true lucha fan.

The matches were very entertaining, and to watch the perpetual rivalry between LA Park and Santo, Jr. is worth every penny.

Recommended for true Mexican lucha fans and serious wrestling marks.",1198800000,,403,4.47945205479452
