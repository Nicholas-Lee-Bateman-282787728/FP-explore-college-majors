8220733,5,B000VZK4ZK,I bought this looking for pole instruction. What I found actually took me off in another direction. I must say I am now hooked. I have a pole and I bellydance as well so I'm no stranger to movement. I get the other reviewers point that as far as pole is concerned its 101. But I think they miss the point regarding the purpose of this DVD. Its more about reclaiming the feminine not so much about being acrobatic. For that alone it serves its purpose and is perfect. I'm a 46 year old who needs to get in touch with my feminine side. I adore these DVDs. To learn true pole I have Jamilla Devilles Art of Pole series. So really this DVD is great for absolute beginners but its really a self improvement and improving DVD more than pole. As Sheila says S Factor is about reclaiming the feminine and the pole is only a part of it. I love love love it. Its the only DVD I haven't given up on. Its still very much worth it as a Wellness and exercise/stretching DVD. If yr more hardcore pole on its own yes try Jamilla or Fawnias DVDs. Lisa,1382140800,2,1034,4.149253731343284
8220734,4,B000VZK4ZK,"Sheila Kelly is an encouraging teacher who breaks down the moves into as many steps as she can so you can see exactly what she is doing.  Still... pole work is not as easy as it looks so expect to put some effort into learning the moves.  She describes the movements very carefully, but it is still challenging to try to do the movements while watching what she is doing.  Trying to do the movements along with the instructor seems to be a universal challenge of any workout video.",1328400000,2,481,4.382022471910112
8220735,1,B000VZK4ZK,"If u have never touched a pole in your life you may find this dvd mildly entertaining. Other than that, this dvd is useless. I honestly sat there at the end of the dvd with my mouth open wondering ""could that be the entire DVD?  Are they serious?"".  I was extremely disappointed wih this DVD- there is nothing new or helpful here...it would be better listed as 'pole pre-101'. U'll learn more from any other instructional video out there, I'm sorry to say; I used to be a big s factor fan, but this was a rip off.",1283644800,,513,4.224489795918367
8220736,5,B000VZK4ZK,"I really like this video, I have read the book the S factor and the video just really helps you get all the moves down pat.",1272758400,,123,3.769230769230769
8220737,3,B000VZK4ZK,"I purchased this product with the other 2 S factor videos (Beginner & intermediate w/lap dance) and this one by far is the better of the 3....  the other 2 videos have absolutely NO POLE moves at all so if pole tricks is primarily what you are looking for the Pole 101 is pretty good, some new moves some i already knew and i have only had one begining class in a professional studio. There is only like 5 or 6 spins on this video so i don't feel it was worth my money but i'm looking for more tricks!!",1245801600,4,502,4.02
