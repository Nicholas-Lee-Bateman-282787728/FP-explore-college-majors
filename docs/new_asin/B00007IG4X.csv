8312977,5,B00007IG4X,"Montague Rhodes James ranks as my all-time favorite author of the supernatural. I first became acquainted with his works when my uncle got me his collected works as a birthday gift. I was only ten at the time but I loved reading and I was absolutely bewitched by his stories of the supernatural, not to mention terrified! I've revisited James' works over the years and have enjoyed TV or movie adaptations of his works.

There is a BBC series titled ""A Ghost Story for Christmas"" that featured adaptations of several of M.R. James' works (the show also featured an adaptation of a short story by Charles Dickens, i.e. The Signalman, as well as original screenplays by Clive Exton and John Bowen). BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas ran between the years 1971 and 1978. Here is a list of the episodes in the series:
The Stalls of Barchester (1971) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
A Warning to the Curious (1972) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
Lost Hearts (1973) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Ash Tree (1975) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Signalman (1976) - adapted from a story by Charles Dickens
Stigma (1977) - written by Clive Exton
The Ice House (1978) - written by John Bowen

More recent revivals:
A View From a Hill (2005) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
Number 13 - adapted from a short story by M.R. James

""A Warning to the Curious"" is highly atmospheric, and its setting, filmed around the North Norfolk coastline certainly enhances the narrative. The dramatization does differ in parts from the source work. Here the main character is not a young man as portrayed in James' story, but an older man fallen on hard times, and the role of Paxton is played by Peter Vaughan. Paxton is obsessed with finding the legendary crowns of Anglia, and uses his amateur archaeological skills to find the treasure. From the beginning, one senses that this is not going to turn out favorably, and the menacing atmosphere is palpable throughout the episode. The dramatization for the most part retains the essence of the source work and I rate this as one of my favorite adaptations in this series.",1431216000,,2238,4.576059850374065

There is a good balance between circumstances, dialog and imagery. The editing is a little rough and 'analogue', but the story holds you. Interesting to watch.",1210464000,,324,4.701754385964913
