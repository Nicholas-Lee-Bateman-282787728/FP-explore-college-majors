1891372,5,B00009W0TT,"If you have a passion for Good Charlotte, love all their music videos, love the way they act and think they ROCK and are very, very, very CUTE than this DVD is for you! I am totally in love with Benji and Joel and I am gonna buy this DVD as soon as I get enough money...",1070236800,,270,3.754385964912281
1891373,5,B00009W0TT,"I hope that the DVD has a lot of footage from the Young & the Hopeless tour... if it does it's sure kick ass and be the greatest DVD. I would also like to see tons of hilarious backstage and tour bus moments. Hopefully they show stuff from a bunch of shows and not just one city to mix it up. I was right against the gate at the 10/8 show, and I didn't see any cameras though. I can't wait for this to come out, but since there isn't much of anything on here yet, and it hasn't been mentioned on the GC site, it will probably be a little while. Hopefully sometime during the spring... the young and the hopeless world tour wraps up in japan mid-january and i'm sure they're probably already working on it, so maybe march or april.",1069891200,4,730,4.111888111888112
1891374,5,B00009W0TT,"Any die-hard fan is gonna get this, and hopefully it'll come out very very VERY soon! Mad props to the guy who video taped most of the material....Josh!(No not Josh Madden.) Hopefully there will be some interviews, from all of the band members, including Chris! Also, if ya like this kinda stuff...check out Simple Plan's DVD coming out soon...check out their website for more info!

They are a group of really great guys.  If you're a real big fan of GC, you will LOVE this DVD.",1058832000,11,247,3.784313725490196
1891378,5,B00009W0TT,Okay for all those ppl that said that this is the best DVD ever i believe b/c GC is the best but how did u get it when its not on sale yet? like i know it has pre-sale but it says they hae to wait till they get it in tell they send it. so how did u guys get it??? just wondering:),1058745600,6,280,3.390625
1891379,5,B00009W0TT,"WOW>>> This DVD rocks hard. What makes this DVD cool is that i thought it was gonna be just a couple of videos then splouge. But naw, It has like 15 videos from the naw cd and old. And on top of that it gives a bio about them and shows where they came  from. I mean i liked it but make that decision on your own... Buy it now before it sells out. PEACE:)",1056499200,30,354,3.72
1891380,5,B00009W0TT,i loved it.i don't even have it though. its rocks. first one to review it. WOOHOO!,1054598400,8,82,4.1875
1891416,2,B00009W0TT,What is wrong with Good Charlotte.  I mean they should have never put out this DVD Joel's voice is quite obviously over worked and hoarse and I mean they just looked too hard.  I have seen Good Charlotte live about 8 times now and this is in no way the quality of them live.  This is a total rip off.  I feel bad that I even bought this DVD I could have saved myself money and went and saw them live.  Personally I would have been a lot more pleased.  If you have to chose between this DVD and a live GC show...pick the show!  Nothing can replace that!  And if you can get backstage meeting them makes it even better.,1108166400,2,617,4.041322314049586
1891417,5,B00009W0TT,this dvd was so cool! i love good charlotte and i watched this before i went to go see them in concert. they play so well on stage and play alot of songs on this dvd. i definitly recommend it to good charlotte fans and just fans of good music. don't miss out on getting this. i love it !!!!!!!!!!,1105920000,,296,3.95
1891418,5,B00009W0TT,"This is an AWESOME DVD that any GC fan should have. It is a live concert in London, on a dvd. It has a lot of songs from The Young and the Hopeless, a few from ""Good Charlotte"" and unfortunately none from The Chronicles of Life and Death. But it is an awesome dvd.",1104105600,,264,3.9074074074074074
1891419,4,B00009W0TT,This a great DVD if you like the band. They play on an awesome stage and everyone is REALLY into it.  I really suggest Buying the DVD,1103155200,,133,3.925925925925926
1891420,5,B00009W0TT,"buy it at the store, it's cheaper.

i saw it at walmart for 10 bucks, i was coming n here to see which is cheaper.",1098576000,3,114,3.56
1891421,5,B00009W0TT,"...have somehow managed to make another awesome dvd, i loved the video collection and seeing this is an actual concert makes it even better. there's so much energy when they're on stage and the way the play, sing and communicate with the crowd is just fabby. One of my fave bands, one of my fave music dvd's. Unfortunately I've never seen GC live cuz I live in Finland and they've never been to Finland but the gig gives some kind of an image what they're like onstage, yay! The recording is great and the bonus features awesome, especially the documentary (""this is what you're missing kids, this is the backstage"").",1097971200,,617,4.618181818181818
1891422,3,B00009W0TT,this is being released in 2010???? um... wow. way to give us 5 and a half years to wait... i bet this is a non-existant dvd. however i know good charlotte is coming out with a live in england dvd soon and an album october 5th.,1091232000,2,226,3.9347826086956523

7993315,1,B00009W0TT,"Thought Good Charlotte sucked and only people with no musical taste would pay money to listen to them.  Well then there's Charlotte live....my god do they even play their own instruments.....doubtful.  Sould be called Good Charlotte ""LIVE?""",1208217600,,240,5.45945945945946

7993318,1,B00009W0TT,"I bought this dvd with my Christmas money last year because I was a HUGE Good Charlotte fan. I have to say that I am very disapointed with this dvd.

One reason is because lead singer Joel Madden's vocals are rough and not plesent to the ear. He sounds like he has a sore throat. He also sounds like he's trying to be overly macho...which he's not. He's straining his instrument and it sounds terrible.

Another reason is that they just don't sound good live. Billy Martin is the only one in the band that accually sounds GOOD. Benji and Joel are the only ones that anyone pays attention to on this dvd and that's a shame because the other more talented band members deserve attention too.

I wouldn't recomend this dvd unless you are a HUGE fan of the band and collect thier merchandise. But if you only like a few songs or if you don't collect thier merch, then this is not the dvd for you. I think I wasted $16.00 on this hunk of crap dvd.",1121990400,4,942,4.251396648044692
7993319,4,B00009W0TT,"This is a pretty awesome dvd however i felt a little upset by the preformance by Joel as his voice is a little harsh but other then that its a awesome dvd and i recommend it to every GC fan out there!

i will admit that seeing them live is a whole lot better but still getting this dvd if you don't and you call yourself a Good Charlotte fan....well thats just a crime!",1109462400,,369,3.9864864864864864
