8152699,4,B000JRQL98,"It's a shame that Roberto Faenza's film version of Antonio Tabucchi's novel, Sostiene Pereira, is so hard to find. I can understand why it doesn't have an American distributor, as it's really a little too ""European"" for most American filmgoers, even those who live in the few places in the U.S. where foreign films are shown.  By ""European"" I'm referring to the fact that it's a rather cerebral work of art, in which the main conflict takes place within the mind and soul of its protagonist, played superbly by Marcello Mastroianni, in one of his last film roles.  The historical setting, Lisbon in the late 30s, is not one that most viewers can easily relate to.  And despite some beautiful views of Lisbon, and some carefully reconstructed period settings, it's not that exciting as a costume drama. In short, it's a hard film to ""pitch"" to most movie audiences, especially Stateside.

Nevertheless, for certain viewers, like myself, this film is well worth seeing.  I must confess that I come at this from an unusual perspective. I happen to be an enormous admirer of the novel, having read it several times (and having reviewed it for Amazon), and I wanted to see how well it came across as a film. I'm glad to say that the essential qualities that made me love the book are still present in the film adaptation. There's a fine sense of the initial, precarious tranquility enjoyed by the protagonist, a portly, aging literary journalist, and of how fragile his sense of security is, given the ever-more-ominous warnings he sees as his country slips deeper into fascism.  The plot is lifted more-or-less intact from the novel.  In addition, most of the salient details of the secondary characters are preserved.  The quality of the performances varies from excellent (that would be Mastroianni) to the merely adequate, and to me the only major defect in the film comes from the usually brilliant composer, Ennio Morricone.  Though on on CD his music for this film might sound fine (especially his fado-inspired song sung in Portuguese by Dulce Pontes), in the context of the movie the score too often calls attention to itself, and runs counter to the mood it's meant to enhance. This is especially true in certain supenseful dramatic scenes toward the end of the film.  Still this does not detract excessively from the overall effectiveness of the film.

Yet, if for no other reason, the film version of Sostiene Pereira should be made available to audiences in the hope that it will lead more people to read the moving, beautifully written novel on which it's based.  Both the book and the movie deserve to be experienced, but reading the novel is, in my opinion, the richer experience, and easy enough to have, given that the book, unlike the film, is readily obtainable.",1388448000,2,2777,4.8354430379746836

8152701,5,B000JRQL98,"A great performance by Marcello Mastroianni in one of his last films, beautifully shot in Lisbon, with the voice of Amelia Rodriquez in the background. Based on a wonderful book by Antonio Tabucchi. This version has no English subtitles, but read the book and you won't need them.
