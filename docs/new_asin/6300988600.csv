302567,4,6300988600,"The U.S.S. Enterprise arrives in an uncharted area of space to answer a distress call from the U.S.S. Defiant, NCC-1764. The starship is visible on their viewscreen, but sensors on board the U.S.S. Enterprise say it's not.
Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov beam aboard and spread out to investigate. Everyone aboard is dead ... apparently killed in a bizarre mutiny, although there are no life readings aboard. McCoy, in the ship's sickbay, tells Kirk that he can find no clue as to why the crew died, but has taken readings to study. Then, as his hand passes through a body and exam table, McCoy realizes the U.S.S. Defiant is dissolving.
Quickly Kirk orders them beamed back to the U.S.S. Enterprise, but Scotty explains that due to the poor stability of the space around them, he can only beam three aboard. After the usual debate, Kirk stays behind while the others beam back. When Scotty tries to bring Kirk aboard, his image wavers, and disappears. Interphase, Spock calculates, will occur in a little over two hours. In the meantime, they must wait. If the captain is still alive, they should be able to retrieve him then.
Complications arise when Chekov goes crazy and attacks Spock on the bridge. Slowly, more members of the crew fall prey to the ""illness,"" attacking their crewmates. McCoy and his staff work round the clock to find a cure. When the doctor suggests Spock ""put some distance"" between the Enterprise and the  Defiant, Spock explains that any movement in the weakened space could disturb both ship's positions and jeopardize Kirk's rescue.
At a little over an hour before interphase, a Tholian ship appears, telling Spock that the U.S.S. Enterprise has violated Tholian space. The Vulcan explains that they were answering a distress call from the nearby U.S.S. Defiant and are waiting until they can retrieve Kirk. The Tholians agree to wait until the appointed time before taking action.
Unfortunately, when the interphase occurs, Kirk is not where he should be. Spock suspects that the Tholian's entrance into the area of space disrupted the U.S.S. Defiant's position. A funeral service is held for Captain Kirk, following which McCoy insists they view the Captain's last orders. Spock reluctantly agrees and the two men go to their friend's quarters and listen to Kirk's touching advice.
Uhura is the first to see Kirk's image floating before her, and for a time, McCoy thinks she's contracted the disease. But when he and Spock see the Kirk on the bridge, they realize that he is, in fact, still alive.
The Tholians decide that Spock has, lied to them and opens fire. Making a decision, Spock orders the phasers fired at the ship. The Tholian ship is disabled, but soon another ship joins it and they begin ""building"" a sort of web made of shining filaments. Spock analyses the web and announces that if they don't bring Kirk aboard and leave before the web is completed, they ""won't see home again."" At the last minute, Spock orders full power against the web and the U.S.S. Enterprise is thrown outside the Tholian's trap, several parsecs from their previous position. The hope is that Kirk, caught in the U.S.S. Enterprise tractor beam when they changed position, was brought with them.
Tensely McCoy waits with a hypo of tri-ox for Kirk, whose air is running out as he's successfully beamed on board the U.S.S. Enterprise, alive and unharmed. In a humorous tag, McCoy and Spock convince Kirk that there had been no time to view his final orders and Kirk, somewhat disappointed that his wisdom had gone unheard, says that he hopes there isn't a similar circumstance where the two men will view the tape.",1058054400,2,3630,4.864297253634895
302568,4,6300988600,"When it was originally written this episode had placed Spock in the dilemma that Kirk would eventually find himself in.  Changing it to Kirk benefits the entire show as it allows for some of the best Spock and Dr. McCoy clashes of will that the series would offer up.  Another change involved adding the environmental suits that were substituted for a belt device worn around the waist that provided a force field for the wearer and provided a supply of oxygen also.  Both of these alterations to ""The Tholian Web"" help significantly, resulting in one of the strongest entries in the uneven third and final season.
The Enterprise finds the USS Defiant a floating derelict but the Enterprise cannot detect anything with the starship scanners.  Further complicating things is the state of flux the Defiant is in due to a spatial interface in the unstable area of space.  Kirk boards the Defiant with Spock, Dr. McCoy and Chekov to investigate why there is no response and they discover that the crew had killed each other in a fit of frenzy.  Within a few moments McCoy reports that the area he is investigating is becoming transparent and he believes the rest of the ship will also.  Attempting to beam back Scotty explains that the transporters can only handle three at a time so Kirk remains while the others return.  The Defiant then disappears completely taking Kirk with it.  Spock finds evidence that the same spatial interface will occur in a short while and that they will make an effort to beam Kirk back aboard then.  The Tholians then encounter them, which disrupts the plans made by the Enterprise and compounds the situation with a ship to ship attack.  Meanwhile McCoy makes an uncomfortable discovery - if they remain in this area of space they will experience the same calamity as the Defiant unless he finds a cure.  Soon afterward crewmembers report sightings of a ghostly image of Captain Kirk appearing to them.
The few moments when Kirk appears as a 'ghost' are quite effective and thankfully not overplayed, each one happening at perfect intervals.  Instead of having Kirk wander through the starship in ghostly form, attempting to communicate, he appears infrequently precipitating the spatial interface the Enterprise is waiting for.  All of the story elements are balanced well here: the encounter with the Tholians, the disappearance and recovery of Kirk, the expected volatile dialogues between Spock and Dr. McCoy, the effects the crew experiences in the unstable area of space. Placing Kirk in an environmental suit works better than the previously suggested use of a force field type belt.  The introduction of such a device would have caused extreme complications in later episodes yet to be produced.  His ghostly appearances in the suit have an unsettling horror feel to them as well, emphasizing the idea that he is stranded.
The only trifle I have with this episode is the way in which Kirk is recovered.  At the moment Kirk appears onscreen on the bridge Spock has full power restored to the starship and this sudden effect throws the Enterprise completely free of the Tholians energy field and Kirk as well as soon discover because he was caught in Enterprise's transporter beam.  Hold it!  Back up a minute...just before full power is restored Spock says ""Ready to transport on my order,"" but he never gives the order or at least we never hear it.  However, we do know that Scotty had locked a transporter beam on the coordinates provided him; perhaps he didn't want to risk losing the captain one more time!  Also notable: McCoy ruins a perfectly good (and I assume quite costly) environmental suit - as soon as Kirk is beamed aboard the doctor gives him a shot with a needle directly through the material of the suit.",1039564800,,3756,4.855799373040752
302569,4,6300988600,"Paramount has a rather annoying habit of, at times, releasing boxed sets of Star Trek episodes that have one or two previously unreleased episodes coupled with two or three that have been out on tape for years.  At the time the Time Travel Collection came out the Voyager and DS9 episodes had not yet been released individually while the Original Series and Next Generation episodes had been available for years.  At the time I found this practice somewhat offensive, but it did not stop me from buying the set.  In retrospect, the set is a nice collection and worth getting if you do not own all four episodes.
All four episodes in the set are quite good.  The Original Series, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine episodes are all classics of their respective series.  The Voyager, while not the best time travel episode ever done for that series (or even that season), is, nonetheless, a solid addition.  Each episode also provides a nice perspective of the Star Trek view of time travel: each tackles time travel (and its ramifications) in a different way.  As a set of four, they fit together well to show a good cross-section of what has made - and continues to make - Star Trek such a wonderful series as well as providing four first-rate 'hours' of science fiction.
If you're not a rabid collector of Star Trek tapes (unlike me), but do like the series, I definitely recommend getting this set.  ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" (Original Series) and ""The Visitor"" (Deep Space Nine) alone are worth having in even a casual fan's collection.  However, if you own any of the three episodes independently, I recommend buying the remainder separately as well.",979430400,6,1663,4.726643598615917
302570,4,6300988600,"There have been so many good time travel stories over the years in all of the Star Trek series, that it is really difficult to narrow them down to only the limited number that were included in this four tape set.  Since it  is presented as a ""collection,"" you might expect to see a virtual  videography of your many favorite time travel episodes.  Instead, the  editors settled on four popular episodes - one from each the four series.  For the most part, they made some good choices.  From the original Star  Trek, there is ""The City On The Edge Of Forever,"" considered by  many to be one of the best Star Trek episodes of all time.  From The Next  Generation, there is ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" a celebrated  episode from that series.  ""The Visitor"" is a well known episode  from Deep Space Nine.  Still, there were so many other episodes that we  might have chosen.  ""Time And Again,"" an early episode from  Voyager, was probably not the best selection.  Subsequent seasons of  Voyager have produced at least two or three time travel episodes that are  far superior.  ""Trials And Tribble-ations"" would be a better time  travel episode from Deep Space Nine.  Next Generation and the original Star  Trek, of course, produced so many time travel stories that it is difficult  to choose one.  For example, while City On The Edge Of Forever is indeed  legendary, we also love ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday,"" ""Assignment  Earth"" and ""All Our Yesterdays.""  And what about the motion  pictures?  Star Trek 4 and 8 are arguably the best time travel stories of  all.  The problem here is with the word ""collection.""  What you  really get is more of a ""sampling"" than a collection.  Nevertheless, with the exception of the Voyager episode, you do get some  pretty good stuff.  We just wish there was more.",962928000,18,1790,4.7254901960784315

302852,4,6300988600,"First off, this is an overall very good set and seeing the original Trek in beautiful HD is greatly satisfying. Also, you can't beat the price at $95 for all three seasons of the Original Series.

THE GOOD
Watching the episodes and seeing crisp and clean detail, vibrant colors, no bleeding and overall a fantastic picture compared to the old DVDs almost felt like watching for the first time. Lots of little details that were not obvious before are so clear now and make this a real joy to experience for a Trek fan. The Enterprise bridge has never looked better! And the uniforms in their greenish gold, blue and red are seen in all their glory on this set. If you have only seen the SD versions of this show before, you are in for a real treat! Seeing Trek in HD was highly rewarding and gives the show a very fresh look. This is a case where an old show greatly benefited from the HD treatment. You won't be disappointed!

Audio clarity is good. I did notice some levels fluctuate throughout, mainly with sound effects suddenly being loud out of nowhere. But overall, the sound quality is good on here. Audiophiles might notice some inconsistencies and defects, though.

In terms of the menu design, the layout of the menus are a little sloppy and could have been designed better. I also noticed there is no 'Play All' feature, which would have been a welcome feature. Sometimes I like binge watching episodes and that feature makes it effortless. Again, no big deal, but I felt like potential buyers should be aware.

As for packaging, I am one that prefers the traditional blu-ray snap cases, so this set was perfect in that respect. Some people would probably prefer a more snazzy case design, but I am content with it.

I also liked the fact that this set allows the viewer to decide if they want to watch the updated versions with new CGI effects and re-recorded intro music or the original versions retaining the original effects and music for the title sequence. Glad CBS did this for the fans.

THE BAD
The package design is a little mediocre and feels lazy. I would have preferred the original font design on this, much like the DVD phaser sets used. Also, the episode titles are on the cover insets, so you have to remove discs to see which episodes are on each disc. The blue plastic also masks the content info somewhat and is hard to read sometimes.

Inconsistent features from season to season. Specifically the repeat feature one uses to play an episode over again. I noticed Season 1 allows the user to put an episode on repeat. However, season 2 and 3 do not have this feature present. I would have liked to have seen this on all 3 and it seems odd that it only is on season 1.

Missing sound effects and incorrect music cues used. Only hardcore fans like myself will notice this, but there are some missing sound fx in a few episodes and a couple of instances where a music cue was missing or the wrong version. Example, while watching the non-CGI versions of the episodes the newly re-recorded version of the main titles is present on a few random episodes. That should not have happened. Also noticed a few episodes have the CBS logo with music while 95% of the episodes do not. No big deal, but it's inconsistent and makes the set feel a little half-assed or rushed.

Horribly bad color transfer. So while watching every episode in order I was impressed by how fantastic each one looked. However, on the season 3 episode 'And the Children Shall Lead', the color temp overall is absolutely atrocious. Every other episode presents the color in a very neutral but warm tone and skin tones are fairly accurate with the gold uniforms displaying a sublet greenish hue. Which is what it should look like. However, in this specific episode everything is screaming magenta or red. Everybody looks like they are red in the face and the gold uniforms are almost appear orange. The bridge of the enterprise has a super red, almost pink look when it should be a grayish blue hue. The color balance is so bad that the main title and credit font, which is normally a sky blue for season 3, appears to be almost turquoise or aqua blue. Again, this doesn't ruin the episode completely, but it definitely begs the question as to how this was deemed passable? The color on this episode doesn't match the rest of the set at all and just looks bad. The casual viewer would probably never notice this. But if you watch multiple episodes in a row and then watch this episode, it is a very notable flaw and definitely a mistake. Disappointing this error actually made it onto the set.

OVERALL
I highly recommend grabbing this set for any Trek fan. I don't think you will be disappointed. Yes, it is without it's flaws and it was a slight letdown there were many oversights and errors and design flaws within this presentation. And those numerous mistakes definitely prevented me from giving this set a perfect 5-stars. But 4-stars isn't too shabby, either. It's great, but not perfect. But for $95, you really can't beat this and should pick it up at some point.

So do yourself a favor and order this blu-ray set, so you too can boldly go...where no man has gone before.",1502323200,,5173,4.557588805166846

302855,5,6300988600,"This review is for Star Trek: The Complete Original Series (Seasons 1-3) [Blu-ray] released Dec 15, 2009 (NOT the newer June 14, 2016 boxed version). I state this because Amazon jumbles all the reviews together for similar product versions making it impossible for shoppers (in such cases) to clearly determine which product the review applies to, and this matters greatly if you wish to obtain the version most suited to you.

When I set out to purchase the version that I would add to my collection it was quickly apparent that reviews were mixed concerning the Blu-ray versions and sorting out the differences would be difficult. After some broad research (outside of Amazon) I found this set to be reliable considering the technicalities of playback but also for the nature of the content. I wanted not only the original version of the show but also the enhanced version, including the unaired versions of ""The Cage"" (which some complained were excluded). This package does not disappoint. This dated Blu-ray set is a fine choice and is not plagued with the issues described in reviews for other versions/formats. The menus are ""fancy"" but not complicated. The sound is crazy good if you have the right hardware (and if preferred the original mono audio is available). You get all the episodes in the original AND enhanced formats. You get two versions of ""The Cage"" (the unaired episode slated as the pilot and later nixed). One of these is an extended version, which includes commentary by Gene Roddenbery and original B&W cuts of the episode. You also get an unaired alternate version of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". Special Features include rare home movies and memories by Billy Blackburn (he was Hadley, navigator/helmsman), ""Spacelift: Transporting Trek into the 21st Century"", Starfleet Access Episodes (on select episodes picture-n-picture interviews and pop-up trivia while viewing), Sci-Fi Visionaries, an Enterprise Inspection Tour, a special Tribbles Disc and much more.

You can read the many other reviews about the enhanced version and like it or hate it I leave that to your own opinion, but as a Star Trek fan who has watched the original version for the better part of a lifetime I like both, IMHO. The nostalgia that I revere for the original series can never be infringed but younger people won't understand it like those who lived in the days of lesser technology. For them I say better to enjoy it as the enhanced version for the memory of their own generation, go for it, it is quite remarkable. Star Trek will go down in the annals of history as one of the greatest television series to date, and in my book rated G for everyone!

One last note about the vendor I got my product from. I paid extra to have my purchase shipped overnight so as to lessen the handling in hopes of minimizing any damage. I received the product on time BUT received it in less than ""new"" condition. I say this because when I opened the package the BD cases for season 1 and 2 were properly shrink wrapped like new inside a cardboard sleeve (as like many DVD movies come) BUT the season 3 BD case was not shrink wrapped inside the cardboard sleeve and when I removed it the front of the BD case (the plastic that retains the labeling) had been cut with either a knife or razor. This could have only happened at the manufacturer or during repackaging. Also the cardboard sleeves had been taped on the outside making it impossible to separate the individual season cases without damaging the cardboard sleeves. Lessening the value of my collection. I paid for a new product making this a sore disappointment. Hope your experience is better.

Notwithstanding the condition of the product when I received it, as a Star Trek grand daddy I give this version 5 stars. Highly recommended!

1st Edit: When speaking of original and enhanced it concerns the ""effects"" as presented in each episode and not the production of the release such as a ""remastered"" version. I do not own the newer ""boxed"" version and can not comment about it other than what can be deciphered from other reviews. I presume that release is a ""remastered"" version very similar to the Dec 2009 release. Maybe someone who actually owns that release can identify it specifically and provide further comments.",1498867200,12,4277,4.821525885558583

302965,5,6300988600,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,  Buy this.  The interface is a smidge kludgy on the discs, but the quality is unsurpassed.  The color correction/cleanup of the raw footage is exemplary. I'd rather see the special features all on one disc, save for the ""tune in next week"" bits which are fine with their respective shows.  You may be huffed that they substituted CGI for the original exteriors and some effects.  Frankly IMHO they did this with care and reverence rather than attempting to be super showy.  Plus, if it cheeses you off, you can select the original (albeit color corrected and cleaned up) effects in the menus.  I am dazzled by the detail revealed by the high-quality transfers.  Dazzled I say.  Dazzling.  And it is good too.  So, 10 stars out of 5.  Get this if you like TOS.  Get this if you want to see what the fuss is about.  Get this if your vision of TOS is a old 16mm print playing into a TV station camera and watching it on your 525 line Sylvania halo-light at home.  I suspect that you will be dazzled too.",1485820800,,1025,4.377659574468085
302966,5,6300988600,"I've only seen TOS on TV long ago; but it was shot on 35mm film (as I know because clips of outtakes were sold as slides for years; I have some), so it could be re-mastered to look really good in full HD.

They recreated the entire theme song and it sounds just like the original but better. All of the new effects do not take away from the original at all. For everything they changed, they kept the fans and original producers in mind so they wouldn't ruin anything. I never noticed a lot of the changes until I watched them talking about it. I was very impressed with the picture. I can't go back to watching it on tv because of how bad the picture is. This blueray looks and sounds amazing.

There was no way we would pass up the opportunity to own Star Trek The Original Series  The Complete Seasons 1  3.  And we weren't disappointed.  Each crazy, nerdy, Captain Kirk getting his shirt ripped from his body episode is in this collection.  I loved being able to sit down with my family and share each episode in order with my kids.  Because space is always an issue at my house, we only have our absolute favorite things on DVD, rather than streaming.  Star Trek is one of the few television shows we own on DVD.  This collection is great.  Even though the cases are large and don't fit on my DVD storage shelves, I am glad they protect the discs from my not so careful kids.

I had forgotten several episodes and was delighted to view them as if for the first time.

303213,1,6300988600,"I'll be brief.  This review is for the bluray version.  The sound volume is exceptionally low.  I need to set my TV volume control at or above 75 to get anything approaching a proper listening level. Normally it is set in the upper teens to low 30's at most.  It is worse if you leave it on the default Dolby 7.1 stereo setting.  This is not a problem with the ads and menu tracks at the start of the disks.  Those have a very typical audio level.  The video source material is flawed.  It is quite common to have scenes out of focus - particularly actor close-ups.  Other times there are obvious specks of dirt.  The transfer is rather noisy due to excessive sharpening in the digital processing.  The more modern special effects are nice, but the new logo and credits should have been done with anti-aliasing to avoid the obvious pixilization and ragged edges.  I like my original ""tricorder boxed"" set better.",1468195200,6,912,4.52760736196319

(4:3 aspect does squeeze a bit) Also there is no blurriness or distortion at any screen aspect change. Just pure Trek through and through. I am very satisfied and for me, no wide-screen version would be necessary. There are extra features I haven't tried yet. There is a cool option at the beginning of each episode to view either ""original"" special effects, or computer enhanced (personally the new CG I brings new life to the original episode without interfering with the story.

303323,2,6300988600,"I bought this series to watch while I recuperate from surgery. I was looking forward to having a sense of how the series unfolded, but the shows seem to be randomly ordered. I am assuming that by not only the star dates on each show but by the costumes, make up, and actors. I was looking forward to seeing the evolution of the writing and character development, not to mention how the series reflected and challenged social trends at the time. However, this collection leaves me as adrift as catching occasional reruns on tv. On top of all that, the quality of the discs is horrible. Sound and audio un-sync and there are many full black outs of both (screen goes black and audio is silent). I'm hoping the replacement is of better quality, though I hesitated to bother with another set because of its lack of continuity. In all, this collection has devastated any chances of me becoming a Trekkie, which might be considered a good thing by some so I gave an extra star.",1455667200,,971,4.5227272727272725

303326,5,6300988600,"I love star trek.  I kind of wanted there to be more special effects added.  And until they showed the side by side comparisons on the first disk's special features, I thought I had paid too much.  I was wrong.  I just had not seen the older episodes in a long time, and did not realize how out of date they really looked back then.  Even so, I won't ever turn away a good star trek episode if offered by a hot girl, and it's old style.  They really did do a lot of excellent work on these.  They really did.  They are beautiful. I kind of hope, one day, though, they go through and add more special effects, or take away some of the propiness of the costumes.  However, these were way worth the money.  The theme song and opening title was remade, and they went back and added William Shatner's voice only recording, added it to the music and it is smooth.  It all flows very well.  If you are still debating about getting this set, look up the special features video about the changes they made on Youtube.  Another reason to buy these is the memories they invoke.  You realize as you watch these, that these little sci-fi stories actually changed the world and how we treat one another now.  I was watching the first episodes, and Uhura's being a black lady didn't phase me, of course, but then I realized that here was this woman, actual woman, working on a military vessel, with all of these men, and how that hasn't even taken full effect in our own time, 2016 AD.  Suddenly, you realize this show was more than ahead of its time, it created a future, it didn't just show us how to be, it actually created how we would become.

303343,2,6300988600,"With this being the 50th anniversary year of Star Trek, I decided to sit down and watch this set, which I bought a little while back.  I'm a huge Trek fan, I bought the DVD version that came out in 2004 and watched all of that.  I decided to upgrade to the blu ray version.  I've only watched a few episodes so far, but I am very disappointed with this!  Here are the main reasons:  1. IT DOES NOT ALLOW A 16:9 ASPECT RATIO!!  The dvd version allowed a 16:9 aspect ratio.  I have a 60 inch tv, and one thing I loved about the dvd version was that I was able to watch the shows as they filled up my tv screen.  Blu Ray is supposed to be better than dvd, and better picture quality and yet I'm stuck with the small 4:3 aspect ratio--huge disappointment!  I thought I could make an adjustment with the player, I called up customer service, but then I looked on the box of this set--there it was--4:3 aspect ratio.  NO OPTION FOR 16:9.  Just about everybody has a 16:9 aspect ratio tv!  What in the world were these people who put the set together THINKING ABOUT?!?!  So disappointing.  2.  Episodes are in the order in which they aired, NOT stardate order.  I want to watch the episodes in stardate order--couldn't they have given us that option?  It seems to be the more logical thing to do.  The DVD version also had this inconvenience.  3.  The menu is not that easy to maneuver through, not the best design.  DVD version was better.  4.  The episodes are not listed on the individual discs--they were on the dvd set--inconvenient.  5.  These episodes are the syndicated versions, not the original episodes.  A few minutes are cut out of each episode.  I watched a few episodes and I realized there were a few scenes missing.  For example, in the episode ""Dagger of the Mind""  Spock does a mind meld on the scientist Van Gelder, and after he does it realizes he must warn the captain.  This section was cut out of this version.  The syndicated versions were also used on the dvd version.  5.  The audio level is too low.  The intro stuff on the blu ray is normal level, then when you get to the episodes, the volume is so low, you have to crank the volume up just to hear it.  Then you have to remember to turn it down after the episode ends to avoid having your eardrums blown out.  I did not have this problem with the dvd version.  Regarding the CGI effects--I've only watched a few episodes so far--so far I""m ok with it.  It hasn't interfered with the episodes I've watched so far, as it is just the outer space shots.  I will give an update after I have watched all of the episodes.

Since it was blu ray, I expected an upgrade from the dvd set.  Instead, I got a downgrade with the blu-ray set.  SO disappointing.  Why is it so difficult for these people to put out a great box set for a fan base that deserves it?  There is precedence--the Twilight Zone box set is the BEST box set out there, so there is proof that it can be done.

Another note:  the earlier dvd set was put out by Paramount, this blu ray set was put out by CBS.  CBS, you dropped the ball!",1453680000,6,3066,4.243055555555555

303418,5,6300988600,"BOTTOM LINE: This will likely be THE definitive, reference quality set that Classic TREK is judged by until the next generation of technology, (4K or something down the road even more impressive), comes along and replaces this one. For now, Blu-ray & TREK fans should rejoice. STAR TREK: The Original Series & the 1080p high-def Blu-ray format are a match made in the heavens. 5 STARS!!!

THOUGHTS: Blu-ray owners who already have the DVD format of STAR TREK: TOS will find plenty to entice them into double dipping thanks to the gorgeous picture & sound upgrades found in this hi-def 3-season boxset. Those who love all-things TREK should have no concerns, regardless of which camp they squat in: 1) purists who insist on keeping things as they originally were, or 2) those who are intrigued by the idea of the old show's visuals being redone in a style closer to those seen in the newer TREK films. You now have your choice between old school & new wave with this Blu-ray set and you can switch between them at any time, so it's highly illogical NOT to trade up. I personally love the new F/X footage. The old Enterprise looks awesome: crisp, clean & classy. The restoration team who inserted the new CGI footage found interesting ways to keep the ""feel"" of the classic original F/X insert shots while making them slightly different and fresh at the same time. The subtle yet pleasing results should attract new fans and those younger viewers who have been weened on CGI only and thus find it difficult to get into movies & TV shows with old-school grainy optical effects. The planets that the Enterprise encounters & orbits are now beautifully detailed and photorealistic. Besides the modern CGI replacement of the handful of ship & planet shots in each episode, all of the people-centric scenes have been color-corrected and painstakingly cleaned up digitally frame-by-frame to remove all instances of dust & dirt, scratches, print damage, etc. Quite simply, this classic TV show has never looked & sounded better than it does here.

There are also some nifty new bonus goodies unique to the Blu-ray set. First & foremost is the fascinating featurette entitled ""SPACELIFT,"" which details the intensive work that went into modernizing the old show's dated VFX and enhancing & upgrading the worn out audio tracks.  A slick 3D tour of highlighted areas of the beloved NCC-1701 Enterprise is also an exclusive new ""gimme"" feature. And don't worry Trekkers, all of the bonus features found on the deluxe DVD box sets of seasons 1-3 have been ported over (in standard def only, though) onto this Blu-ray set, so you're not losing anything! If you love TREK and have perhaps tried to introduce your kids (or grandkids) to this historic sci-fi series but they balked because to them the F/X look laughable & dated then this Blu-ray set is the way to go!",1446940800,9,2849,4.822085889570552

303481,5,6300988600,"As a fan of the ""Original"" Star Trek (who bought the original 3 season releases on Laser Disc) I found this a wonderful set and highly, HIGHLY recommend it. It delivers both the original series as broadcast (in HD) and the ""New"" modified visual effects version (in HD) so the choice is in your hands and the ability to switch back and forth to compare the new SFX in contrast to the original is fun and very impressive. The clarity is also amazing, (*LAUGH*) see the commentary on coffee stains (isn't HD wonderful) on Spocks shirt pointed out in the Trouble with Tribbles. If your an ""original"" Star Trek fan and haven't seen any of these HD versions you will be blown away big time. Most of the time I felt as if I was watching newly discovered never seen or broadcast before episodes.. Thats how stunning these remastered versions look.

If I am to Knit Pick and this is Knit Picking in the extreme, I would have liked to see a more weathered and detailed Starship Enterprise in the revised SFX versions. I understand about the time and budget restraints spoken about in some of the special features, but at times the detail worked into the background planets and environments (digital matt paintings) make the CGI Enterprise look under rendered. I am very aware that they wanted to retain as much of the old look and feel of the original enterprise as they could but the contrast of the simplicity of the CGI Enterprise in relation to the complexity of the other CGI SFX can at times make the Enterprise look like a toy placed in front of life like CGI. Just a tiny, tiny bit jarring. The reason it worked in the original broadcasts was the poor definition quality in the TV tech of the time. That said; if you liked the originals these modified remastered versions will rock you back on your heels and are well worth the money.",1442534400,2,1832,4.518072289156627
303482,5,6300988600,"""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before!""

It would be hard to find many TV shows as wildly influential as the original series of ""Star Trek,"" which inspired a devoted fandom, several spinoffs of varying quality, a string of films, and most recently an alternate-timeline reboot directed by J. J. Abrams. And despite the late-sixties bright colors and miniskirts, there's a bright-eyed yet intense quality to the series -- it's a smart, well-written series with a few duds, headed by a trio of memorable and lovable characters.

In the twenty-third century, mankind has spread out among the stars, and established a Federation of like-minded worlds. The starship Enterprise is part of their Starfleet division -- and it does pretty much everything, from fighting hostile aliens like the Klingons and the Romulans, ferrying diplomats and alien dignitaries, and exploring planets with weird and freakish creatures on them (including a furry creature that sucks salt out of its victims).

The captain is James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who is assisted and guided by his two trusted friends, the logic-driven, half-Vulcan science officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the crusty, blunt-spoken doctor Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Deforest Kelley). With the faithful crew of the Enterprise behind them, they travel through time, encounter godlike aliens, fall prey to some weird diseases (including one that makes you drunk!), get caught in countless planetary wars, deal with a suspiciously large number of crazy/evil computers, and encounter countless strange creatures (a rock monster, brains in jars, a hostile lizard-man, flying brain cells, Jack the ripper, tribbles...).

Yes, it has those bright colors, beehives and chintzy sets that you expect from a late sixties show, especially a science fiction one. But what made ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" such an enduring show was that it was a depiction of a brighter future, full of exploration and wonder, without becoming too starry-eyed to take seriously. And it had a good balance of ""Big Moral Message"" stories (""racism is stupid,"" ""war is bad,"" ""don't trust computers blindly"") and solid sci-fi stories that featured some truly weird, out-there alien life forms.

Simply put, ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" tended to have very well-written, intense stories that relied on a mix of action (usually involving Kirk losing part of his shirt), well-written dialogue and plenty of powerful emotion (a guilt-ridden starship captain becomes obsessed with destroying a machine that killed his crew). This allowed some of the stories that would otherwise seem rather silly (Spock getting a pancake-sized alien cell embedded in his back) to have some serious tension, but not in a way that precluded some actual humor (the entire episode about tribbles -- chirping little furry balls that reproduce exponentially -- is side-splittingly funny, especially when poor Kirk gets buried alive in them).

It also has one of the most cohesive casts ever to be seen on TV, even though actors like Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and Walter Koenig were underused. For all the gags about Shatner's acting, he plays Kirk as a man of both brains and passion -- he's driven and emotion, with a love for his ship, his crew and the unexplored crannies of the galaxy that rules his life. But he's also intelligent and canny, and more than once we see him outwitting a foe, whether it's making a primitive gun by hand or playing the ultimate bluff against a vast alien ship.

And he has uniquely solid chemistry with Nimoy and Kelley, so that you can really believe that these three characters are fast friends who bicker, joke and advise each other... well, mostly Bones and Spock snipe at each other, while Kirk sits there smiling. Nimoy gives a brilliant performance as the half-Vulcan, half-human Spock, struggling with the emotions that his Vulcan nature doesn't allow him to express, even though his relationship with his people is rather tempestuous. Kelley plays McCoy as the exact opposite -- a fiery Southern doctor whose determination to do the right thing sometimes clashes with his duty. Yes, he boozes it up while on duty, but who doesn't want a doctor like McCoy?

Flaws? Well, like any TV show, ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" had some dud episodes, often involving space hippies, Abraham Lincoln and brain theft. And some of the attitudes towards women are... seriously problematic, especially in the final episode. The series briefly dabbled in the idea of a female first officer, and Nichelle Nichols' Uhura is depicted as strong, gutsy and smart when she gets to do something (which is admittedly rare), but it's still heavily weighed towards the men.

It also should be noted that not only have the old episodes been remastered, but new CGI exteriors have been created to replace the old models. Viewers can choose to watch the older exteriors if they want, but the CGI models actually do look very good and polished -- and in the case of episodes like ""The Doomsday Machine,"" they actually enhance the story. Don't worry, they didn't go all George Lucas and update the interior effects like the transporter.

Few TV shows have had the impact on nerd culture that ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" has had, whether it's transporting to a parallel reality or catchphrases that everyone misquotes. Despite some episodes that veer off into the silly and/or stupid, it's still an excellent, enjoyable series with a bright, idealistic view of the future.",1442448000,2,5671,5.107874865156418

They offer both the original format of the episodes as well as an enhanced one for Blue Ray. Having this is great for a collection that includes most of the ""Star Trek"" films. It is worth its price, and for a Trekkie like myself it is as good as gold. This provides the person who saw the movies to inspect the earlier work of William Shatner (Captain Kirk) and the noble vulcan, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy): who can live without the latter's raising his eyebrows.

The original effects are still there and can be accessed if you are a Star Trek Original series purist who demands that nothing be changed. My only complaint is that they could have made the special effects even better, but in the special features it is explained that producers didn't want to anger fans of the show by altering the special effects too much. What a shame. I would love to see what they would have come up with if the team behind the new special effects didn't have one hand tied being their back.",1431302400,,708,4.496124031007752

303637,5,6300988600,"I have owned many different TOS sets, starting wth the original releases on VHS. Each time I ""upgraded"" to a different DVD set, and now finally Bluray, the picture quality has improved. I don't think the series has ever looked better. Sure, there are countless re-runs on broadcast, and other online services but to own the set is generally what every Star Trek fan needs. There have been countless reviews also of this set, and I cannot add much or complain about much. I did find it strange that season 2 and 3 would not play from where I ended and either turned off or stopped, while season 1 did. Some Blurays will do this and some don't and it is how they are coded. But since Season 1 did, I would have liked and hoped the other seasons would also. As for the special effects, I enjoy them . I don't have an angle button on my remote, but it is still fairly easy to switch between the original and new effects using the menu. Switching between only changes the external effects (like when in orbit) or phaser fire, etc. it does not change the remastering of the footage. I'm not much in to the extras or special features, so won't really comment on them.

303706,4,6300988600,"This Paramount Science Fiction series that ran on NBC from 1966-69 was the STAR TREK phenomenon that started it all regarding a spaceship set in the Milky Way galaxy during the 2260's with the ship & crew led by Capt. James T. Kirk(William Shatner), first officer & science officer Mr. Spock(Leonard Nimoy),and chief medical officer Dr. Leonard McCoy(DeForest Kelley).

Even though STAR TREK only lasted 3 years, it still had a major influence on pop culture and became a cult classic in reruns throughout the years after NBC cancelled the show back in the Summer of 1969. In fact, I used to watch STAR TREK in reruns as a kid back in the 1970's and 1980's on KTLA, which is now the CW affiliate for Los Angeles and then on KCOP, which is now the My TV 13 affiliate for L.A.

I also used to watch it in reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel from 1998-2000, and then on TV Land back in 2002, and now I watch it on MeTV Monday thru Friday at 4PM followed by EMERGENCY at 5PM, and then CHiPs at 6PM as part of MeTV's ""Rescue MeTV"" weekdays.

 You can also catch STAR TREK every Saturday night at 9PM after WONDER WOMAN at 8PM, and BATMAN at 7PM as part of MeTV's Sci-Fi Saturdays too.",1428278400,,1172,4.337899543378995

On September 29, 1966 I went to my cousin Tom's house. I had turned 11-years old in June and Tom being 4-years older than me was going to sort of 'babysit' me while my parents were out somewhere. I had recently purchased a telescope and was thoroughly enjoying myself as a young amateur astronomer. Now on this particular evening at Tom's house I knew that the episode of ""Bewitched"" that was airing that night was going to have a plot that had something to do with the moon and I was interested in seeing it. I had not seen the previews for Star Trek and knew nothing of it's existence.
While anticipating the 9pm showing of ""Bewitched"", at 8:30 Tom said, ""Let's watch Star Trek...it's a decent show."" Star Trek???!!!
""The Naked Time""...my life changed that evening. That did it. I was rapt and tuned in every week for three years until the fateful notation in the TV Guide on June 3, 1969 said, ""'Star Trek' moves to a new time slot (7:30 Friday night) with it's final first-run episode.""
Then came the reruns and my love for this show deepened.
Please understand that I never cared about special effects. They were really good for the time and added to the drama, but for me like many others, the draw for this show was the camaraderie of the crew. They genuinely cared about each other and I felt like I knew each one personally.
I purchased the original DVD series a number of years ago. So when the BluRay remastered edition came out I never gave it a thought.
BUT NOW...I can honestly say it is like watching the show for the very first time. It is simply breathtaking! I won't mention the extras in this DVD set; my purpose here is to say that I even as a 'purist', (or so I thought), I am spellbound by the new treatment of my favorite show of all time.
If you are a fan of Star Trek give your old DVD set to Goodwill and purchase this. It is worth every penny.",1426291200,4,1906,4.311977715877437

Years ago I had the VHS complete series and I watched them so many times that I wore out the tapes.  Now, there was no need to go and edit out scenes from these excellent DVDs, it just irritates me to no end.  I am ready to spit nails!

I am so mad, I don't want to watch these knowing scenes have been edited out. WHY DID THEY DO THAT???????",1425859200,10,491,4.072916666666667

The colors are so much brighter and each episode is clearer and more realistic looking. To top it off, the audio in DTS. Wow!! This is one set I'll treasure for a long time.

303788,5,6300988600,"I was skeptical of the blu-ray release when reading other comments left by a number of others. What the grumbling was that they did not include the unaired version of the Cage. However I have the Yellow, Blue, and Red egg shell cases that was released back in 2004. The price difference of when I purchased it compared to the Blu-Ray version was astronomically different, the produce wasn't. I paid $317.00 at Best Buy for the complete set and thats before taxes. The blu ray version is Identical it the order of the shows for each season on the 2004 release with the only difference there are more shows per DVD on the blu ray's. 2004 version has 4 per disk with the last disk taking up the slack with at least 1 to 3 episodes. The Blu-Ray version follows suit with 5 episodes per disk, with the last disk taking up the slack. But too you must remember with the Blu Ray version you are getting 2 copies of each and every episode per disk. Think about it when you have a choice to make on how you want to watch the episodes. Regular or enhanced. So I bought this Blu-Ray version as individual seasons and came out farther ahead than had I bought them all at once. The difference in price is astronomical. Check this out, Season 1 from Best Buy was $99.00, Seasons 2 & 3 cost me $109.00 each., The blu-rays on Amazon cost me $110.55. That's $30.67 for season 1, $39.94 for seasons 2 & 3. The price includes shipping and handling. Now for the nitty gritty I'm still new at this and trying to check out the differences between the original and enhanced versions sometimes leaves me at odds. I have been practicing and getting better at checking the differences and yes I too agree Gene Rodenberry would have done this if he had the tools. Trivia does any one know that they used plastic coffee cup lids for some props on the Enterprise. These lids back then did not have any holes to drink from the cups other than a small piercing to allow steam from really hot coffee to escape. Again all episodes and unaired episodes are included in the set. Both versions of the Cage as well as the unaired alternate version of Where no man has gone before. Look for them on disk 6 of season 3. Thanks for reading.",1425513600,41,2199,4.365853658536586
303789,5,6300988600,"My opinion on this set is based on experiencing the first disk of the first set. I would assume the remainder of the disks would contain pretty much the same content although I can't say for a fact.  The more time I spent with this disk, the better I understood it. The disc uses an interesting menu system which provides options for some very impressive and enlightening ST experiences. I was totally enamored with how the video was updated - was amazed by all the time and effort that went into ""bringing the show into the 21st century"". Then I found myself thinking how I missed the old school video - and dang if that wasn't an option too. The video could be viewed in the updated format, or step back & look at it the way it was - back in the day.  This set comes packaged with three individual cases  (one for each season) which are held together with a plastic wrap. I would have liked to see the set packaged in a box to hold all three together like other sets in my collection.  Also, this first disk of the set opens with a trailer, which I could do without. But having said that, I still give it 5 stars (more if I could) because there is so much to like.  Kudos to those who worked on this project!  As for the content, in my opinion Star Trek is the best Scifi series of my lifetime. Live long and prosper Star Trek, and to those whose dreams and craft made it possible!",1425427200,2,1383,4.2

It even includes 'some' of the 1976 animated episodes which are actually quite brilliant. What I was a bit disappointed with was the altered images using modern CGI technology that really doesn't blend well with the 1960s technology at all.
I have noticed on my BluRay box that the original versions are also available, not sure if that's the case for the USA version.
I was actually watching some episodes when I heard the sad passing of Leonard Nimoy who really made this show special.
I want to dedicate the review to the memory of Spock and the cast members who are no longer with us.

Awesome remastering--you can view how they did it in the extras.  You will ADORE the remastering & enhancing!  You can choose the original or the REMASTERED & ENHANCED version!  Everything super wonderful!  Except for the sound on the first disk--Season 1.  I had to raise the sound on the TV to 99 max & it STILL wasn't enough.  Season 1 disk 1--I had to adjust the TV sound settings to ""Movie"" & 2 other choices to maximize sound & it did work a little.  Why do I have to raise the sound to max when on normal settings?  Couldn't they have made the sound better at production?--evidently a production problem!  Second disk on Season 1 a little better in sound at production level.  Dune, the sci fi movie, comes in very loud & strong & AWESOME with normal sound settings--nothing wrong with the TV with Dune!~  Other than the sound quality, the remastering is SUPERB & I DO MEAN SUPERB!

303823,5,6300988600,"This classic Sci-fi series was one of Mr. Nimoy's best in the TV series. As Mr. Spock, He created his best catchphrases on television that are most memorable to the young and elder sci-fi fans that's never been forgotten are ""Fascinating"", ""Logical"", ""Illogical"" and ""Live long and Prosper"".  Before Star Trek was born, He was in a earlier television show appearance in a serial drama as a guest star with future Star Trek alumni Walter Koenig in General Hospital (1963-present). In 1970, Nimoy was later cast as Agent Paris in Mission: Impossible. In 1983, Nimoy was named as film director and made his directorial debut behind the movie camera filming Star Trek III: The Search For Spock (1984). From 1976-81, Nimoy hosted his own reality documentary weekly series was entitled In Search Of: (TV Series) that deals with paranormal, fact or fiction, prehistoric creatures, underwater creatures and others. Mr. Nimoy will be missed as an actor, film director, screenwriter, author, musician, singer-songwriter and host. Thank you for the wonderful sci-fi memories, Mr. Nimoy!!!

303824,5,6300988600,"Even the so-called bad episodes have something to gain from them. If you're new to Star Trek, just keep in mind this isn't a show about space battles or hardcore phaser combat. It's about human (or alien) interaction and the things we can learn from one another. The show looks simply splendid on Blu-Ray and unlike that OTHER sci-fi franchise box set, you have the ability to choose between the originals and the new and improved editions. I came of age watching The Next Generation, but nothing beats the original. Kirk, Spock and Bones are the faces of Star Trek. Each episode is like its own little movie. I miss episodic television like this. Nowadays every episode bleeds into the next instead of being its own contained story. The special features on this Blu-ray set are just great and the A/V quality is perfect. You couldn't ask for anything better.

Episodes must be selected separately - there's no 'play all' option for a disc.  Then, once the episode is selected, a button must be pushed again to 'play.'
The packaging is silly;  inside a fiddly outer plastic case is another paper box holding the discs in odd plastic trays and separate cards (easily lost) with episode information.
The titles of the discs are only printed around the center hole and extremely small.

However, Paramount has lovingly given this series the best possible treatment in restoring each episode from the series. In addition, I'm not a total purist and don't mind the fact that the episodes are _greatly_ enhanced with space CGI, giving an almost ""wow"" feeling upon seeing the exterior shots. Some episodes have a screen-in-screen ongoing commentary showing what was done where. Amazon's under $100 price for the 3 years is about where it should be (the list is still in the stratosphere, but Paramount likes there $$).

303926,5,6300988600,"There is very little, if anything, that can be said for a review of Star Trek the Original Series that has not already been said repeatedly by other reviewers. The show achieved cult-like status as early as the mid-1970s, which is now nearly one half a century ago. Against all odds, the show has stood up extremely well since its original airing over 50 years ago, and has remained so popular that it has been repeatedly released on every media format that existed starting from the 1970s until today, including, Betamax, VHS, digital disk, DVD, and now, Blu-Ray. With the advent of the 4000K resolution television systems that have recently been announced, it is to be assumed that the Star Trek show will also eventually be released for this new format. So then why a review on this series a Blu-ray discs?

As someone who has watched the show starting as a young child in the 1960s, a great surprise arose in me when I first watched this release on the Blu-Ray format. I was expecting an increase in quality, since Blu-ray has such an improved visual appearance over DVD, but nothing could have prepared me for just what an improvement in visual and audio quality this set would yield. Quite frankly, the word that comes to mind is shocking due to the outstanding  nay, superb  technical quality of this release. You can read great detail about the re-mastering process that was undertaken to rescan the original 35mm masters from the series to make this Blu-ray release, but actually, all you need to do is pop one of these disks into your Blu-ray player, sit back, and be stunned. The video quality is so good, so clean, so crisp, so vibrant, that it appears as though the show was filmed just last week. In fact, there are many shows being made today that do not present such a superb video as compared to this re-mastered version of Star Trek. No kidding.

It is well known that many of the individuals who were involved in the video and television production and of the show were highly acclaimed experts of their craft in the 1960s.  Because NBC went with the decision to shoot the show on 35mm film, and coupled with the great expertise in the production staff, the result was a series of original masters that are superbly executed and beautifully rendered. The only thing that was left to do was to rescan (and, in a sense, rescue) those original masters for the high resolution supported by the Blu-Ray format. And thats exactly what was done, over a multi-year effort that made use of a large number and variety of craftsman and technicians to take those original film masters, rescan and edit them, and convert them into the full, high resolution Blu-ray format.

The results are simply amazing. The show presents itself in a way that has never yet been seen before, and even those of us who have seen the show since childhood now see aspects of the show that were never before visible. Details on the uniforms, the console panels, the ship interiors, and even the various special-effects (which have been re-mastered using CGI digital methods) makes for a completely revolutionary visual experience. It is not an exaggeration to say that this release of Star Trek the Original Series is unlike any release that you have ever seen before.

There are also many other touches involved. Parts of the musical score have been re-recorded with modern recording techniques. As I mentioned, the special-effects have been read done using digital format, but if you prefer to see the original special effects, those are still present on this release (and are toggled with your remote control). The clarity of both the visual and audio aspects of the show are simply without precedent, and make us feel that we are watching the show for the very first time. In fact, what we are seeing here is better than what even those involved in the original production of the show never had the opportunity to see, due to the technical limitations, not of the filming technology, but of the reproduction and distribution technology of the day. Thats truly a wild thing to think about.

This release could have been priced much higher than it is, and it is true that it originally was a relatively expensive set to acquire. However, at this point in time, early 2015, the price of the set is so low as to be ridiculous, when one considers the technical quality of the episodes that it contains. For anyone that likes Star Trek, and has not experienced this set, I cannot hesitate in recommending it as highly as possible. It is truly a unique experience never before seen in the history of Star Trek, one that will bear repeated viewings, and will stand the test for nearly any technically picky person. And it makes me wonder, if these same original 35mm masters may eventually be rescanned again for the 4000 K resolution technology that is slowly beginning to emerge. But that particular possibility is irrelevant at this point in time, due to the superb quality of this release. This can be nothing less than a seven star review out of five, and I would give it a higher star rating if I could. As you watch the episodes, you completely forget that you are watching a show that was made more than half a century ago, and can be completely immersed in a truly extraordinary visual experience.

Note:
The set contains all kinds of bonus features, many of which are extremely interesting to watch. I learned quite a number of things about Star Trek, surprisingly, that I thought would never be possible, due to my familiarity with the background of the show. The commentaries are excellent, and there are a number of bonus video features that are quite interesting to watch. Nevertheless, the true value in the set resides within the episodes themselves, which sparkle like never before.",1421366400,2,5781,4.721506442021804
303927,3,6300988600,"Well, the series themselves (the remastered DVD's) rate ""5-stars"", but the TYPE & DESIGN of packaging chosen was TERRIBLE!! The styrene plastic used to make the cheap cases that hold the multiple disc's ARE the problem! They arrived with numerous cracks throughout the case surfaces in various places - these cracks were visible through the plastic wrap that held the 3 case series together for shipping - so cannot tell if the damage to these cases came from rough handling during shipment to me, or from shipment from the factory to Amazon, or both. But I can tell you this for a fact: Whoever designed these cases to hold the multiple discs should've been publicly FLOGGED for an EXTREMELY poor design! The type of plastic used in the manufacturing of these cases is the first problem - the plastic is cheap styrene & lends itself to cracking very easily! The design involved in holding the discs in place is another problem - it obviously was never designed to last for any serious length of time - probably designed so that after a few years of use you'll be forced to buy another set! A much simpler system for disc storage and a different & more flexible type of plastic material used would've made a WORLD of difference here - and been MUCH less costly to boot!! I finally decided, with the storage protection of each disc being first & foremost in consideration, to buy a couple of 25-item packages of single-disc DVD cases - making it much easier to access each disc as well as leaving lots of room for labeling, etc. One last thing needs to be mentioned here: We buy these items to not only be able to watch them over & over again, but MOST IMPORTANTLY: We buy them to get rid of those damnable, pesky, irritating-as-hell commercials that played with these shows originally. So what did these idiots do? Well, at the start of disc #1, (season 1), there's a 3 or 4 minute ""commercial"" for some stupid show that I guess we're supposed to ""run out & buy"", as well. PUUUULEEEZE - leave these B/S ads OUT of these DVD series, dammit!! We're paying enough for this stuff - we DON'T need more B/S advertising, ok?? We get enough of that crap with current-run shows!! AND, to make matters worse, you HAVE to watch this garbage to get to the first episode - the coding on the disc will NOT let you ""fast-forward"" through it - you HAVE to let it run!!

303942,5,6300988600,"I've wanted to own this on DVD for years. I waited because just a couple years ago the cost was over $300 for all 3 seasons. Ridiculous! Then, this Christmas, this set came out. Soooo, I discretely put it in the Amazon shopping cart for my wife to find. LOL.

The package is very nice and true to the original collection theme. Each season is color coded.
Tons of extras. Some interviews, backstage information, etc.

When I put in disk one, I was amazed at the picture quality of the show. The colors are vivid but not exaggerated. The clarity is unbelievable. One thing people don't know about back then, but a lot of shows were filmed direct to TV tape, which was very inferior quality. But Desi Arnez, who owned Desilu studios, was brilliant. He realized the legacy value of these movies and insisted that they all were made using movie quality film. So, the transfer is as sharp as a modern movie. You can see the pores of skin in close ups. You can see the sweat on a brow.

Now about the remastering. I am a purist and I was very skeptical about doing anything to the original I am thrilled with the remastering of this series. In the remastered edition, if you look at the Enterprise in orbit around a planet, it is now a very very realistic looking space ship. The planets have been cleaned up and no longer look like painted plastic beach balls. They have beautiful detail like showing atmosphere, 3D quality land masses, and so on. Now, if you want to see the original broadcast, that's on the DVD too!

I'm so glad she got this for me for Christmas. I love the collection.

In this release, all the original effects have been replaced by modern cgi versions. While I understand why this was done, I still enjoyed the original effects and miss them.

Part of the charm of the original series was the use of the best effects possible in the late 1960's. From a historical point of view, the replacing of these effects with modern tech is tantamount to drawing in a tattoo or lip piercing on the Mona Lisa! Sure, that would bring her ""up-to-date"" but is it necessary?

Still, it's great to have every episode at my disposal. One phenomenal positive aspect of this edition is that the producers digitally cleaned-up the original negatives, making the images as bright and colorful as I remember them as a child.",1419724800,,878,4.80794701986755

And watching these shows I was struck by how many cool things Star Trek had envisioned nearly 50 years ago -- like cell phones, talking computers let alone computers at ALL, automatic door openers, lasers -- it's just really cool to see all that stuff that really hadn't been thought of so long ago.  Pretty cool stuff and a must-have for any Trekkie.

I remember classmates talking about the show and how it was amazing (and the girls mentioned William Shatner's good looks). So I eventually saw an episode... I believe it was The Galileo Seven. I was hooked!!! I grew up into the 70s and 80s still watching the episodes, but then grew out of the phase, discovering new shows and Star Trek was pushed aside for many years.

Just about a year ago I pulled out some Star Trek tapes I'd either recorded off Television or bought and decided it's time to upgrade to DVD. The set I purchased was deemed 'Remastered' so I assumed this just meant the picture and audio were cleaned up. WRONG! It turns out the folks at CBS decided the original shots of the Enterprise flying through space were not up to par with today's CGI technology so they remade these shots with computer-animated figures.

This is why I'm giving 3/5 stars. The show is a 10/5 but I knocked two stars off here simply because these new scenes make it quite obvious the show has been tampered with. If you're watching the episodes for the first time you'll STILL probably know that's not how they looked in 1967. I for one loved the model appearance of the Enterprise in its original form. Perhaps the most irritating thing about this whole situation is THERE'S NO WAY TO SEE THE EPISODES IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM ON DVD!!! I looked around online and apparently in 2004 the original show was offered on DVD in its original form but that set has been replaced with the Remastered version.

I typically do not like changes to originals, but these have been done well.  My only complaint is that the video tells you when there's an enhancement to the episode with a little icon in the top of the screen, which can be a little distracting; it would have been better with no icon.

in regard to packaging, damn good in my view, aside from cardboard box, you get 3 layers of 6 inch bubble wrapping, with 3 layers of tight wrapped plastic around the entire set...as you dig deeper into it. and then you get to the big plastic box the set is in,...with a small cardboard box that the dvds are in......and......everything is in a plastic sleeve, well protected.  i am damn impressed with the packaging.  after looking into the dvds they seem to be just 1 sided...and it seems there are 10 dvds to a set.

In this product people are complaining about the enhancements in the programs. As in graphics, and some actual changes in the images. I saw the enhancements, but if look at the option, you have the option to view the shows in their original appearance. Personally, I like both. You know this regarding a 45+ year old TV show. I am a big Star Trek fan, and was worried I would not changes to the videos. But yesterday was a rainy Sunday, and the satellite was out, and watched the first three episodes after the pilot.

Those two reasons alone would actually rate a five-star review (even my wife, who is not a Star Trek fan, said, 'Whoa!').  However, while SOME of the special effect enhancements are superb (i.e. planets that look 'real'), I was disappointed in how animated a number (not all) of Enterprise shots looked.  That was a real disappointment.  Finally, the packaging is downright foolish.  The episodes are listed on the inside covers. Unfortunately, the back cover also has a disc on it; so, in order to see the remaining episodes that don't on the front cover, you have to remove the last disc.

304211,5,6300988600,"Amazon lumps all reviews together, so I'll say up front that this is a review of the 2009 Blu-ray Star Trek Seasons 1-3 sets. The box covers show a large Starfleet badge against a black background, and there are a total of 20 discs (Season One has 7, Season Two has 7, and Season 3 has 6) giving us every episode of the Original Series.

I'll spare you my nerdy Star Trek fanboy routine about how I grew up on this stuff, how awesome the show is even today, and how the new Trek can go climb a mountain (major nerd points to those of you who caught the reference... ""Captain Kirk is climbing a mountain, why is he climbing a mountain?"").

Here is why, for the first time in 40 years, Paramount got it right. Or almost right. Unlike George Lucas who seems to be on a mission to eradicate all original prints of his movies in favor of his new versions, here Paramount gives us the option of seeing Trek the original way or the new way. This is done in the Blu-ray menu when selecting the episode you want to watch. You can also switch in the middle of the episode by hitting the ""Angle"" button on your remote (the only slight problem is that the ""Angle"" option is only available during the FX scenes where 2 options are available, so you have to be quick).

A quick word about the new FX scenes: HORRIBLE. But that's just the opinion of a cranky old Trek purist and graphics geek... a bad combination. I was already prejudiced against replacing old material with snazzy computer graphics, but the worst part is that the graphics aren't even very snazzy. I'm comparing it to the impressive cgi on the 2004 Battlestar Galactica series, so you'd think in 2009 Star Trek could've gotten the same treatment. Unfortunately the Star Trek cgi looks like a very dated 80s animation... actually similar to the short ""Genesis Planet Starfleet Proposal"" animation shown Star Trek II (1982). Anyway, my point is that cranky old Trek purists will probably find themselves sticking with ""Angle 2"" which is the original version.

Now on to the actual remastering and digital cleanup. FANTABULOUS. Unlike some previous releases of Star Trek which recycled the 1978 mastering, this time they went back to the original 1960s film prints, scanned each frame, ran it through the best available cleanup program, and finally did a manual cleanup on the tough spots, frame-by-frame, with real humans. Subjectively, they boosted the sharpness & contrast, complimenting the already-colorful cinematography with vivid color palettes that only digital can offer. On that point, I agree that the color enhancement is ""what Gene Roddenbery would have wanted"", and it's certainly pleasing to the eye. You won't see any sterile Kubrickian white scenes, nor will you see any brooding Ridley Scottian dark scenes. These are distinct, vivid, 60s hippy colors, and for the optimistic future that Roddenbery believed in, you gotta love em.

I do own the old VHS sets as well as the first DVD sets from 1999, and although I haven't yet done a side-by-side comparison, I can tell you that the Blu-ray remastering makes me happy & squishy all over.

So why do I say Paramount ""almost"" got it right. Well, first is that I noticed some very minor audio issues in 1 or 2 episodes. In ""The Man Trap"" there's a scene where the dialogue between Kirk & McCoy becomes quiet to the point that I had to turn up the volume. This is a minor nitpick. On the whole, they did a fine job with the audio including the controversial re-recording of the opening themesong (where, just like in 1966, they got a small 26-piece orchestra to play Alexander Courage's arrangement note for note but this time with ""clean"" recording techniques. I couldn't tell the difference, which means they did a great job).

My 2nd nitpick, which I alluded to earlier, is I'm curious to see how the FX scenes would have looked with good, Battlestar Galactica type cgi, or ideally if they had used (expensive) models like in 2001 A Space Odyssey (1969), and in Star Wars (1976). Watching the new cgi piqued my interest to the possibilities but didn't satisfy.

You'll be happy to know that Paramount resisted the temptation to fiddle with special effects with actors. All the revamped FX are exterior space shots only... with perhaps 1 or 2 acceptable exceptions. In ""The Naked Time"" when Scotty uses a phaser to cut through the bulkhead, the original show never showed a beam coming from the phaser and hitting the bulkhead. Here, they added it which is fine with me.

So I gotta say I'm pretty pleased with this set. I feel like Paramount showed great restraint and kept the show, for the most part, the way it was originally done. And where they might have gone overboard, we still have the option to see it the old way. Mr. George Lucas, would you please take a lesson and release the original Star Wars (and more importantly the original THX-1138) the way history remembers it? The problem with re-doing special effects is that they will always eventually look ""dated"", 5... 10 years from now or 100 years. So let's just stick with the original ""dating"" for nostalgia's sake.",1412640000,,5099,4.688268156424581

The shows can be played with additional info playing at the same time.  The menu takes some getting used to, to properly navigate, however.

You can switch between the ""remastered"" and the ""1960s-era"" versions, solving the whining by purists that their precious dorky special effects are the best.  I grew up in the Sixties with a Black & White Star Trek and believe me, the remastered is better and in Blu Ray no less.

Some episodes are heavy-handed, some are silly, but all -- yes all! -- aspire to mingle a bit of thought and originality into the 50 or so minutes of entertainment.

304369,5,6300988600,"My experience with Star Trek is something of a jumbled mess.  My first exposure to anything ""Trek"" was the film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.""  Before that, my only knowledge of the series was what little bit my brother told me about it as he was the only person in my family who liked the original series and watched it in syndication.  I also recall getting a few coloring books featuring Trek as well.  After that, my only real exposure to Trek was the occasional TOS episode that I saw while our family was on vacation because we lived too far out in the country to get cable (not that my father would have let us have it anyway) and the films until TNG hit the airwaves.  Even in that case, though, I only watched TNG if the weather allowed.

When I entered college, my dorm room thankfully had cable television.  I caught a few episodes of TOS on the Sci-Fi channel and watched TNG whenever I had the chance.  DS9 never grabbed my attention, and when Voyager and Enterprise came along, I only took moderate interest in either of them.

It hasn't been until the last five years that I've really upped my exposure to Trek.  I started reading many of the books (I'm especially fond of the IKS Gorkon books), have met many castmembers, and have taken a particular shine to TOS.  I went ahead and purchased this set in order to ""experience the full Trek.""  I was not disappointed.

I have watched all of the episodes included in this set and most of the documentaries and specials.  I'm especially fond of the first season and really enjoy seasons two and three.  This set features excellent restorations and remastering of the source material, and the option to switch between the new and classic special FX is a very nice touch.  I especially like the fact that the updated effects blend seamlessly with the old footage from the program.  Don't go into this expecting a glaring difference between the effects and the original footage as happened with the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy.  No, Paramount took care to not detract from the source material, opting to enhance the work that was already done instead of removing it entirely from the program.

Of particular note is ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" which garners its own disc and includes documentarites and the DS9 episode ""Trials and Tribble-ations.

Eventually I plan on catching up with DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise.  I have many, many friends who loves these shows as well as TNG and TOS.  TOS has become my favorite program of the lot so far, and I hope to continue my voyages with the Starship Enterprise!

Highly recommended.",1409184000,3,2615,4.636956521739131

Much to my chagrin, he insists on telling me about them, though I certainly saw them long ago, and he knows it!  I think this may be the best gift he's ever gotten.  Certainly the most used!

304758,4,6300988600,"Many years ago, a Trek memorabilia collector friend showed me some 35mm film frames salvaged from editing room floor clippings of an original Star Trek episode. These individual frames showed actors and sets from the show during actual filming. What amazed me was that the clarity of these motion picture film pieces was superb, and the colors were deep and vivid. This didn't match the mediocre to poor image quality of the episodes that I saw on television at that time. Fortunately for fans, the original prints of the show have survived intact and have been re-mastered to Blu-Ray in this 3 DVD set with the original's film quality intact, and in some cases, surpassed.

One of the weakest aspects of the original show's production were its special photographic effects. The budget and the technology for great effects weren't available when this show was originally shot. Thankfully, new, higher-quality effects were created and seamlessly added to the original live photography to make the shows look much more contemporary and enjoyable. As a bonus, the new Blu-Ray issue allows you to watch original episodes of Star Trek with either the new effects or the original effects. In some cases, and depending on your Blu-Ray player, you can switch back and forth between new and old effects in the middle of an episode.

Other updates include new stereo theme music and visual effects that begin each episode. These are very faithful to the original sequences. Their higher quality add a pleasant frosting to an otherwise very tasty cake.

Image quality overall is superb, especially when considering that this show was shot in the 1960's. One can see fine details and colors that were simply not reproducible on older televisions. Although monaural, dialog sound quality is very good.
Occasionally, sound effects have been enhanced and sometimes panned left or right in order to enhance the story line. Some sound effects can also be heard appropriately in the surround channels. For this reviewer, the updates made to this show's original picture and sound significantly enhance the viewing experience and make watching each episode even more enjoyable.

A considerable number of extras are included with this set. Notable is the fact that one disc is devoted to the very popular, ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" episode. Included on that disc are the Star Trek animated series Tribbles episode as well as my favorite, a Star Trek: Deep Space Nine time travel episode that allows the DS9 characters to meet and interact with the original series' crew by carefully and respectfully merging new show footage with the old. Klingon Lt. Whorf from Star Trek: The Next Generation also joins the DS9 cast, and he attempts to explain the reason why TOS Klingons and later series Klingons (makeup) look so different (Watch!).

So many things make this TOS DVD box set great for fans. My primary, but minor, nit includes having the episode listings printed on the backs of the three DVD plastic boxes' cover art sheets. One must open a box's cover, remove the title art sheet, then turn it over in order to read which episodes included in that box. If you have access to a copier, I suggest copying each episode sheet so that you have your own easily accessible episode listing.

It is great to see all of the episodes from this series so lovingly restored and updated. If you are a fan of this series and haven't seen this collection in Blu-Ray on a good AV system, what are you waiting for? Very highly recommended!",1406246400,,3508,4.91722972972973

304828,4,6300988600,"Excellent presentation of all 3 seasons of the Original Series, but Season 3 is sorely lacking in bonus features when compared to Seasons 1 & 2.  There is no behind-the-scenes 'Starfleet Access' on select episodes in Season 3 like there are peppered throughout the Season 1 & 2 discs.  The only plus for Season 3 as a set is the presentation of the original series pilot 'The Cage' (2 separate versions) and the unaired cut of the second pilot 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' complete with a never-before-seen episode teaser sequence, alternate main title, and limited end titles.  This is the version first shown to NBC executives in hopes of selling the series.  Otherwise, the ability to watch both the original versions and the digitally remastered ones with enhanced special effects make this set a must-have.  I was hoping for text-only commentary on some episodes from Denise and Michael Okuda like they had done for the Star Trek ""Director's Series"" double DVD sets of the first 10 films.

I wanted the show on Blu-ray and have both the original special effects and the updated version. After watching about five episodes, I decided there was no point in watching the older footage - the new was so much better. The series was shot on 35mm film and has been transferred to high definition. Of course this really brings out some of the cheesy sets and hokey costumes, but it's all in good fun. I watched this show faithfully when I was a little kid and it brings back good memories. This set also contains the two original full length pilots. And a lot of bonus features that are of varying quality.
My only complaint is with the packaging, which came with cracked casings.  It doesn't impact the play-ability of the discs, so i'll still give it 5 stars.",1404864000,3,906,4.5182926829268295

My Samsung blu-ray player had some issues reading the discs, but I have had problems with other discs (Star Wars in particular), so I blame that on my player. The set played fine on the Pioneer drive in my computer. Of the three plastic cases, two were quite damaged. It appeared to be caused when the discs were inserted at the factory, not during shipping. Many of the retaining tabs were broken off and the hinge retainer and pins for the interior holders had damage also. Since others have noted this problem, I decided not to return the set and bought new cases (about $14).

There is a noticeable discrepancy in the volume from the intro to the episodes, but if that is the worst thing about this package, it is nothing.

I know there is controversy regarding the CGI Makeover the episodes have received for landing party sites, planets, alien ships/effects, and the USS ENTERPRISE, herself; however, I am pleased to mention that the ORIGINAL QUALITY episodes are on the same disc as the Digitally Enhanced Version.

The space shots of the Enterprise pass-bys are fascinating to watch; they are close-up and unique each time. It's cool to be able to sometimes see people inside the portholes. I especially like the battles or space phenomena. The added activity in the background of the planet scenes is also a treat.

I've been a Treker since 1972 reruns and therefore have always had to get by with cut scenes, crappy broadcasts, and the rest. This set was well worth the $70. The packaging is OK, but not worth the complaining that I've been reading about here.

1) Sound quality is inconsistent. It will be loud in one episode and softer in the next.
2) Navigating between episodes is cumbersome because the DVD menu is structured differently than virtually any other DVD out there. There is no master menu to navigate between chapters. If there is, I sure as heck don't know how to find it because it's not at all intuitive.

Simple drop down menu lets you choose quickly so why make it harder than that?Also, to switch from original to enhanced feature you have to start the episode over. It is really a buzz kill to have such a remote - dependent experience. I personally will not purchase any future editions that lack such an elementary labor saving feature as the PLAY ALL option. This (besides the excessively high prices) shows basic lack of respect for the fans. It's micro - managing by remote control and adds insult to injury every time you wish to re - vist the marvelous vision of the future that is Star Trek.

I KNOW them better than I know any literature, and I'm happy to say that they influenced my life greatly concerning my attitudes about race and the what kind of future to aspire for.  That said, I LOVED watching them again with the new special effects!!!!  Just the anticipation of wondering ""what did they do to this one"" is worthy of watching every episode once again!!  Also, I cannot say how much fun it is to see the home video shot by one of the extras or hear personal stories of what it was like to work with Gene Roddenberry or the rest of the cast/crew.  If you loved them before, you will love them even more!!  If you've somehow missed out on seeing them before, the new effects will make you feel right at home watching a more modern television series with (sometimes) great writing and (sometimes) great acting.  Nevertheless, the future presented herein is still one to aspire to and the blue ray versions make that future seem all the brighter, clearer, and something to shoot for all the more!!",1402704000,5,1080,4.536082474226804
305344,1,6300988600,"There's not a lot that I can add about the classic Star Trek series that hasn't been said. Over the years, it has become one of the best known franchises of all time. It was fun watching Kirk, Spock, and McCoy again in a beautifully mastered format. There's even one episode where Spock's shirt is soiled from Leonard Nimoy dropping some food on it at lunch and no spare shirts were available. Nobody noticed it on regular TV, but it's much more visible seeing cleaned up 35mm prints. The new computer generated effects are a bonus and not intrusive compared to the original effects. The commentaries and documentaries were all fun to watch.

I hate giving the show one star, but if the blu-ray player is connected to the internet, the show pauses randomly. Hitting Play continues things without losing anything, but having to do it two to three times per episode is a nuisance. I've tried the disks on two different players (Sony and LG with up to date firmware) and both have the same problem. When the ethernet cable is disconnected, the problem doesn't occur. It probably has something to do with BD-Live. It's not a problem I've had with any of the dozens of other blu-ray disks I've played.

The show was certainly a trailblazer, giving science fiction fans an adult alternative to the kiddie science fiction that was prevalent at the time.  But that being said, the quality of the series was very uneven thanks to the hurried schedule of weekly television production and budget constraints.  Classic episodes (City on the Edge of Forever, Space Seed, The Doomsday Machine, Amok Time, Balance of Terror, Mirror, Mirror,etc.) are all here alongside episodes from the opposite end of the spectrum (Spocks Brain, Turnabout Intruder, Platos Stepchildren, And the Children Shall Lead, etc.).  The series was interesting when it would tackle current issues and disguise them as stories in the future.  For example, war (A Taste of Armageddon), race relations (Let That Be Your Last Battlefield) and modern technology (The Ultimate Computer) could all be addressed without fear of censorship.  The show was at its best however, when the occasional extraordinary script seemed to amp up the production quality (see the aforementioned classic episodes).

My recommendation to you is that if you order a series from Amazon, watch every disk within 30 days. Take days off work if necessary. Put the rest of your life on hold and watch the whole lot.

305509,4,6300988600,"Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek is required viewing; a trend-setting space saga that retains its ability to entertain despite changing tastes, times and technological advances that have decidedly rendered a goodly number of the Enterprises misadventures quaint by comparison. CBS/Paramount have given us a vintage TV series in optimal quality, and with the added benefit of re-envisioning every episode with upgraded special effects. As a purist, I am usually adverse to such tinkering with the director's original intent. But I do have to say that the upgrades are not only non-obtrusive, but faithful to Roddenberry's vision which, for its time, was ground-breaking to say the least.

And CBS/Paramount has given us each episode twice: in its original state and new and 'improved'. Is the image quality consistent. If you mean is it razor sharp with eye-popping colors. For the most part - yes. A few shots exhibit advanced grain and a soft quality. But again, we're at the mercy of source materials that are well over 50 years old. These discs look fantastic making this set a no brainer for anyone who loves Star Trek as much as I do - as so many continue to do - and will likely continue to for many, many years to come.

PROs
-Picture and sound awesome (depending on your system)
-DVD vs. VHS (duh)

CONs
-One of the outer cases was cracked (no biggie, they're on a shelf)
-The menu's take a bit to get used to (but hey, it's not Starship science:)

The fact that episodes are not listed on the actual DVD is not a biggie either - I actually like throwing one in and being surprised.

My hubby really likes that he can choose between the original and ""enhanced"" versions.
The main difference between the two is that with the enhanced version the pictures of planets appear more ""realistic"".
Some day way in the future it'll be interesting to see if they guessed right with the new planets discovered....LOL! Sorry I couldn't resist.
I don't have any complaints about this set and I think Star Trek fans will be happy with it.
We watch using a receiver that upscales the quality of both the video and audio so I'm not sure if that makes a difference compared to those using just a regular blu-ray player without a home theater system.
I would imagine this will look and sound great either way.
I don't speak tech well enough to get into all the specs; I'm just a happy ST fan.

They did all that AND changed every planet shot to a cartoonish-looking shot that is simply NOT the original.  The positioning of the ship is different, the look of the planets are different...in short, the original shots are gone and have been replaced by something totally different.

305711,5,6300988600,"I am old enough to have seen the original Star Trek series in black and white.  My first colour TV did not arrive until 1972 and throughout the 50s and early 60s, we were entertained by the Golden Age of mostly ""B"" Sci. Fi. films, of which the standouts filmed in color were ""Forbidden Planet"", ""This Island Earth"", and ""War of the Worlds.  So, having started out in the poor definition world of rabbit ears B&W, what a pleasure to revisit these Sci. Fi. pearls in 1080 HD and blu-ray.

Happily for Star Trek fans, the VHS and DVD era has treated us well with re-issues and this latest Blu-ray set of Star Trek is absolutely stunning when combined with the updated special effects which just complement fine vivid colors and sets used in the original series.
In a sense Star Trek was both the end and a beginning of Sci. Fi eras.  It came at the end of the Golden Age of ""B"" Sci. Fi. movies of the 50s and 60s (and was concurrent with 2001:  A Space Odyssey).  After these two, no one would think of making another Sci. Fi. movie in black and white or without serious and expensive attention to special effects.  And it was the beginning of the biggest TV/film franchise Hollywood has ever seen.  You can also credit Star Wars and even Aliens owing their formative success due to the legion of Sci. Fi. fans who love Star Trek.  Fortunately, the original Star Trek series was filmed at great expense on 35mm colour film and that now has been restored, remastered, blu-rayed, and you have the option of adding new special effects which are impressive in how well they merge with the original film.  WOW....compared to what I saw on my 19 inch black & white TV in the mid 60s, this new edition is Warp Speed ahead.

I don't care what any critics say.....I LIKE William Shatner as Capt. Kirk.  I have watched this series over the years and behind this facade of hamming, he plays the character perfectly. No one understands self-parody like Bill.  Combined with the incomparable Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, deForest Kelly, and all the other cast members, there is not one weak casting in the entire series, which is unusual for rushed, budget conscious TV series.  Mark Lenard as Sarek, for example, who appears in several episodes and later on becomes integral to the films, was made for his role.  How about James Doohan as Scotty, Nichele Nichols as Uhura, Majel Barret as Christine, George Takei as Sulu and Walter Keonig as Chekov.  All intelligent, perceptive actors that despite studio and budget woes, never let the quality of their performances sag.
Volumes have been written about Star Trek's success; its impact on the viewing public and especially the popular culture and science communities.  I won't go into that except to say that this series and, in general, its subsequent offshoots have been a huge positive influence....a real anomaly when considered the nonsense foisted on us in modern TV.

I can only add that being a teenager when the series came out in the 60s (also concurrent with the Apollo missions) changed my life.  Instead of being an unemployed rock star or business hack, I went into the sciences & engineering and have never regretted it one minute. Even the huge success of Star Wars some 10 years after Season 3 of Star Trek ended did not have such a profound effect on people's view of  science.  No offense to Star Wars fans but much of George Lucas' adventures were storytelling.  A lot of Star Trek, on the other hand, involved actual science or accepted scientific theory, some of it coming true....for example the communicator turned cell phone.

The blu ray picture is truly astounding....the colors are vivid, deep, and with the new special effects (which are very well done), I give this blu-ray edition 5 stars.  The soundtrack is excellent and I only wish my Dad, who saw it and loved it in the mid 60s was alive to see it today.

Finally, the price.....I have purchased a VHS set and 2 previous DVD sets of Start Trek in the past.  This set is an incredible bargain at $79.95.  The VHS set cost me over $900 twenty plus years ago and there is no comparison in quality.

So, beam yourself up a blu-ray box set and go boldly where no one has gone before.....",1393977600,10,4201,4.595174262734584

Picture and Sound abound. The kids prefer the new (was there any doubt) and I watch it with them but then I like to go back to my halcyon days and watch it sans upgrades and remember it as it was and we are all happy and sometimes one of them comes in and sits and watches it with me and talks about the changes and the things that are the same and that's worth it.

(IMPORTANT UPDATE: YouTube (as of 2015) now features episodes of the original series, side by side comparing the original footage with the new CGI versions. If you are not aware of the differences, be sure to watch these YouTube clips(look for TrekkieChannel) and read this review, so you know exactly what you are getting before you buy.)

There is plenty of confusion about which versions of the Star Trek Original Series are on which sets on DVD. Adding to the confusion is how Amazon lumps all of the reviews and comments for all of the different versions together. Having researched this for myself, here is what I have determined:

IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE OLD VERSIONS as seen on network and in syndication from the 1960s to the early 2000s with the original (Matt Jefferies) special effects and space shots, and original opening credits, you want the set that comes in the RETRO EGG boxes (colored in the colors of the uniforms: mustard yellow, sky blue, and red). These are the versions that long time fans remember. The original footage was cleaned up (a first round of ""remastering"" years ago) but kept intact. The 1960s special effects, which were state of the art at the time, are intact. In the classic exterior stock shots, the Enterprise is blue-gray.  Depending on the shot, the nacelles of the ship (the ""exhaust pipes"") have either the bulb or vents. The opening credits are the originals: the Enterprise---with the vent nacelles---heads for the right side of the planet, then shifts to the left. The music is orchestral only for the first season episodes, with the woman's worldess vocal for the second and third seasons.

IF YOU WANT INDIVIDUAL EPISODES OF THE OLD VERSIONS, look for the versions sold in 2-episode cases. The (ugly) packages of these feature photos of the cast members on the covers, with a Star Trek in a florid funky type going vertically up the front of the boxes. Type in the name of the episode you want in the search window. Only the old versions of the episodes are sold separately this way.

For those who can accept nothing less than the original episodes as they were, stick to the above.

IF YOU WANT THE NEW REMASTERED VERSIONS WITH NEW CGI EFFECTS, you want the set that is packaged in the RECTANGULAR BOXES WITH SILVER TRIM. The footage has been remastered (a subsequent round of remastering in 2006-7). These versions, which began being sold in 2007-8, come with the completely new exterior space shots by the CBS special effects team of Michael Okuda, replacing all of the Jefferies original stock shots. Some of the new CGI shots mirror the old ones, but some are completely new (the ship from different angles, new closeups, etc.), but ""in the spirit"" of the old. All space shots were redone. The Enterprise is gray. The nacelles of the ship are shown with the bulb (but the bulb is ""unlit""). The angles of the Enterprise orbiting is different. Many scenes on the planet (background, etc.) have been redone, some even reshot. The opening credits are completely new, using new CGI. In the opening, replacing the shot of the ship going to the right, then left of the planet is a shot of the ship going wide to the right of the planet. The music is redone, with a new vocal. Currently, only these remastered episodes are showing on syndicated TV, the old ones are off the air, nowhere to be found. These remastered ones are also the ones sold via Amazon direct HD.

VERY IMPORTANT: there are cuts and edits in these versions, apparently designed by the powers that be to speed up the narrative. The problem is, these cuts wind up damaging the narrative. Newer fans will likely not know the difference, but long-time fans will definitely notice scenes and important bits of dialogue painfully missing---and be incensed. This series was so good that it can withstand these cuts, but they still should not have been made at all. They stupidly destroy a number of memorable classic scenes, some of them extremely important. In some cases, the cuts are so bad, the narrative almost makes no sense. For instance, in original and correct versions of The Ultimate Computer, Richard Daystrom's psychology, M5's ""issues"", and Kirk's reaction to automation unravel gradually, and tension ratchets up step by step, while in the revised versions, every plot development is abrupt. In ""For the World is Hollow..."", so many scenes are missing that that the high priestess falls for McCoy suddenly and for no apparent reason. In ""Assignment Earth"", the comedic antics of Teri Garr's Roberta Lincoln are cut, as are some priceless jokes in ""Piece of the Action"". There are many examples like this. These cuts are a big problem with the remastered versions for those who remember, and reason enough by itself to be cautious about owning them. (This is why I give the remastered set 3.5 stars instead of 4.)

My take on the new CGI: it is a mixed bag and a tradeoff. Positives: You get some ""pretty"" new space shots, up to what is supposed to be contemporary sci-fi TV/film standards, that replace the often repeatedly used familiar stock footage of the ship. Okuda did a decent job and many of the new shots are reasonably consistent with the old ones---where the team replicated the originals.

However....Negatives: the new CGI is largely disappointing. The effects are video game quality, but not up to the standards of the Star Trek films, which were bigger budget projects, and therefore much more realistic. They are also not up to modern sci-fi film standards at all. Some of the new shots try to get too cute and wind up being unconvincing, and worse, ruin the flow of the narrative. Surprisingly to me, the new CGI Enterprise and other ships are less realistic-looking than those in the original Jefferies footage, which was shot using actual large models. The movements in the old shots were those of large vessels with some weight. By comparison, on some critical episodes like The Doomsday Machine, involving a lot of ships-in-space action, the new effects look flimsy and too video gamish, movements too cheap looking. Small time. Certain new space shots are thoroughly boring. For example, the barrier at the edge of the galaxy, a shimmering dish of energy in the original, is nothing more than a garden variety cloud in the new versions. Bottom line, ""prettier"" but not necessarily better than 1960s vintage, and definitely not an improvement in story telling.

Surprisingly, the new CGI is less interesting than the original effects, and can make no sense. Balance of Terror and Doomsday Machine, the space warfare episodes that should have been tailor made for new CGI, are flimsy and video-gamish. In Elaan of Troyius, a Klingon ship pursues the Enterprise. In the original version, you see shots of the Klingon warship, then the Enterprise. Very simple. In the new version, you get a shot of the two Enterprise nacelles with the Klingon in the distance. Why do I want to see the nacelles and a blur? In the original, you see the stock shot of the Enterprise firing phasers, which never gets old. In the new one, the ships jump around and look fake.

One of the few episodes that benefits from new CGI is Tomorrow is Yesterday. The sunlit Enterprise pursued by the jet, and new sequences of the Enterprise sling-shotting off of the sun are great. Sadly there are few others.

Overall, the series as a whole, however, is so good that even with the new cuts and less than convincing effects, it remains a compelling viewing experience.

IF YOU WANT SOME OF THE REMASTERED EPISODES BUT DO NOT WANT A FULL BOX SET, look for The Best of Star Trek:The Original Series volumes 1 and 2. Each box contains four episodes. Volume 1 contains ""Balance of Terror"", ""City on the Edge of Forever"", ""Trouble with Tribbles"", ""Amok Time"". Volume 2 contains ""Space Seed"", ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", ""Piece of the Action"", ""Journey to Babel"".

So for DVD, these are the choices you face. But if you have Blu-Ray, you don't have to decide.

THE BLU-RAY SET OFFERS BOTH OLD AND NEW VERSIONS OF THE EPISODES IN THE SAME SET, and apparently even lets you toggle between the two. Of course, you would need a Blu-Ray player.

I hope this helps.",1392163200,38,8239,4.782700421940929

First, it looks fantastic. The conversion is super sharp and crystal clear. Honestly, it looks like it was filmed today. It looks that good. The colors are very sharp, and it's awesome to see the planets spin. It's like I'm seeing it for the first time. It's so clear, that when the screen menu pops up, it looks like the Enterprise is coming right at you.

Second, the sound is amazing. It's so clear, it really is amazing, words can't do it justice.

Third, the extras.  The extras are awesome! The best part of the extras is that you can watch any of the episodes in it's original form, or with the enhanced version. Just for fun, I watched some of one episode in it's original version, and the differences are night and day. That's such a nice touch. Some of the episodes have commentary, and it's nice heard tidbits on some of the episodes. They also have other features that any Trekkie would love.

If you are a purist you don't have to view them but they are so tastefully incorporated I think you will have a tough time not doing it.  They really made sure not to go over the top but to make them fit nicely.  It's great to see so many new shots of the Enterprise that simply were not possibly with budget and special effects of the 1960s.  I think Roddenberry would be thrilled.  Finally, the extras are great.  I loved the extra on the first disc that goes over how the orchestration was reworked.  This will sound geeky, but it brought tears to my eyes.

The discs are packaged wonderfully, no loose discs.  I love the interviews with the restoration team, and the other extras, like Gene Roddenberry introducing ""The Cage"" as he did on the VHS version so many years ago and the un-aired 'Where no man has gone before"" original pilot. The quality of the video is great, and being able to toggle between the original and remastered special effects at will, is priceless.  All in all, this is a fantastic set.

306059,1,6300988600,"The issue I have with this set is that it arrived in an unsatisfactory condition. My wife recently purchased this for me as a gift. When it arrived I noticed it was packaged very loosely in the box.

I was very excited to begin watching the series but before I could even get the plastic off, I heard pieces rattling around in one of the cases. I found the locking tab had broken off the plastic case for season 1. I'm a very practical person and I'm not worried about appearance so I didn't think much of it.

When I removed the discs from the box for season 1, the first disc was loose in the box. It was not affixed in the plastic case. There was also a huge gouge in the disc. The gouge was on the non-DVD side so again, I didn't care.

I began to care when I tried to watch the second episode of season one. about 20 minutes in, the player could not read the disc and skipped ahead to the next chapter. About 40 minutes it the disc was unreadable again and was skipped ahead to the credits. It's very unfortunate. The series is available on Netflix but I wanted to own this piece of sci-fi history.

--Edit--

I just realized I can't return this because Amazon's policy is that they only accept DVD returns in the original plastic. If I were you, I wouldn't gamble with this purchase. Now I'm stuck with it and my wife wasted a sizeable chunk of cash.",1388102400,3,1356,4.2

306106,5,6300988600,"So when Amazon had Star Trek deals around Black Friday I was torn between the Blu-ray and DVD options. Why? Well I love my movies, including the packaging they come in, and the DVDs have much more attractive packaging. However after much deliberation based on the formats, extra features, etc. I chose to go with the Blu-ray option and it was worth the sacrifice of special cases.

The Blu-ray restoration and remaster of this show is great, leaps and bounds above the quality you get on DVD or Netflix, and the option to flip between effects (old and redone) on the fly is a fantastic way to see what they've done with the show. Being too young to have actually watched it originally it's more of a novelty for me to see the old effects, because I admittedly watch with the new effects 99% of the time. I don't think it takes anything away from the series at all.

The extra features on the Blu-ray copies are glorious as well. The featurettes and original versions of 2 episodes included are nearly to the same quality standard as the restoration of the main features themselves and it doesn't feel like they sacrificed anything to fit them all in. I would highly reccomend the Blu-ray option of this series as it looks amazing, maintains the spirit of the show while keeping you from falling out due to it's dating and admittedly, it fits better on my shelf than the fun looking DVD cases.",1387929600,,1392,4.54183266932271
306107,5,6300988600,Nice to revisit Star Trek from the past.  Excellent in blu ray.  Will enjoy for a long long time.  Thanks,1387929600,,105,4.15
306108,5,6300988600,"Uncut - those 6 minutes cut from each episode for commercials are back (50 minutes now instead of 44).  You may not notice since they often did a good editing job, cutting a few seconds here, half a minute there, usually unimportant stuff, but sometimes you definitely can notice scenes you haven't seen in decades, or important segments you don't recall ever having seen before, despite having watched the show on T.V. for decades.

The re-mastered images are beautiful (and often more in line with the story - for example, when Spock is supposed to pondering the shuttlecraft following the Enterprise, he's looking at the view screen and the stars are coming toward the ship (so he's looking forward).  This is replaced with a shot (with nacelles) of stars going away from the ship (so he's looking backward - TOWARD the trailing shuttlecraft he's pondering).

All the planet shots are new.  They're far more realistic planets instead of fuzzy stock footage, and if they added rings to a planet, you see them from orbit and from below while on the surface, too.  There are dozens upon dozens of new exterior shots of the ship from numerous angles to replace the few shots of tired stock footage they used again and again, so you get the see the constitution-class starship like you've never seen her before.  And we even get to see other, never before seen ships, replacing empty space shots - like we see the Anteres in Charlie X - a freighter, and it looks like one from the animated series, but not a cartoon.  We see cleaner phaser and photon torpedo shots and other effects, too.  Just as an example, the Metron (Arena) is brighter, and there's a sparkling effect in the air around him, and that's pretty cool looking. And the Gorn even blinks!  There are lots of things like that.  It's amazing what they can do.  Plus all dirt, scratches, and numerous defects have been digitally removed.  Shots are clear, clean, and the colors are more vibrant and vivid.

But for those purest, the old effects are still preserved so you can watch the episodes with the original effects if you prefer them, too.  And they didn't fix things they could have just because they could have.  The James ""R"" Kirk tombstone, for example, still says James R. Kirk.

While they didn't do anything or everything they could have done, choosing instead to remain as true to the original as reasonable, they did an outstanding job giving the show a more modern, more professional look, just as Roddenberry would have done if he had the time and money or technology.

Closed captioning is spot on (unlike the aired versions, where it was often out of step by more than a minute sometimes.)  This is important since you may better discern what was said before when it was hard to hear, make out, or you mistakenly thought they said something else.  Try it with the captions on, even if you're not heard of hearing like I am.  You may learn something new.

For years (decades, actually) I always wanted TOS on tape or disc - but I finally could afford them one black Friday when they were a mere $60, BLU-RAY, and RE-MASTERED.  Everything I could ever want.  And they're gorgeous on a high def T.V.

Don't be fooled by old reviews of older editions that are lumped in with new reviews of newer editions.  Amazon keeps them all lumped together because Trek is Trek to them, but they shouldn't.  The Trek I bought near the end of 2013 is what I'm talking about it, and it's brilliant.  Re-mastered for those who want that - original footage too for those who don't - uncut and all cleaned up, with the optional closed captioning, and no commercial breaks, T.V. station logos, news interruptions, weather reports, bad reception, or any of the things that often foul up transmitted recordings.  This is the only copy of TOS you'll ever need (or want) and it's here now.  I love it.",1387929600,,3854,4.6415929203539825

But like the old Beta-Max player, VHS players are becoming rare items indeed, and a few of my cassettes have some shipping damage.  So I wanted a Blu-ray disc set as a more permanent, easily stored solution.  When this set came on as a special, my price-point value was met and I grabbed them.

Well, the Blu-ray set is even better than the VHS tapes, having enhanced graphics.  The story line is still the same western-movie formula, over-simplified morals, Capt. Kirk save the girls and beat up the villain.

The equipment and tools mock-ups seem primitive, and technology references dated .  In one of the episodes, they kept referring to data stored on magnetic tape.  Well no one today stores anything on magnetic tape.  So that makes the series dated and greatly detracts from the ability to immerse oneself in the plot.  I often find it difficult to watch this series anymore.

There are clips in the main show here and there that either they forgot(doubt they did) or did not remove scratches and spots due to cost or it was the best they could do which I doubt.
The missing remastering concise of camera angles that are not the main camera focus. These none ""cleaned"" clips from different angles are a very small percentage of the over all total viewing I watched. So, to try and give it a far percentage and since I haven't watch all of them, I would say it's between 1-2% of the 4 DVD's I have watched so far. Very small percentage I think. But I'm a little disappointed that they missed it when remastering.
There are not much video(30min/DVD) on the extras for each DVDs, but that's not the reason why I purchased it and I still enjoyed the extra info and seeing some of the old cast members.
Anyway, I really am enjoying these DVDs. and would have given it a 5 IF they did not miss remastering some of the film AND had more extra video. I'd like to give this a 4.5 star.",1387756800,,1222,4.317391304347826

The newly created visual effects are a big improvement, but restraint was exercised to keep them in line with the original effects from the 1960's.  I feel like this is what the shows producers would have done if they'd had the budget and technology available at the time.

306171,3,6300988600,"I dunno if this is a issue with all of them and a poor transfer or if i just got some bad discs but i am noticing audio cut outs on different discs in certain spots when using the enhanced version ( where audio drops out for a few secs then comes back ) which i find annoying as well as a few video glitches as well where it stops for a second or so then skips ahead and resumes playing. I can't remember every single episode it happens but for example as i'm writing this review it is doing it on season 1 disc 3 episode 2 ""The Managerie Part 1 "" at 22 minutes 17 seconds where Spock tells Mccoy he had no orders to take control of the ship on mine you just see his mouth moving with no sound from 22:17 to 22:22 then it comes back. This is what i have noticed happening all over the series on various discs. Now when i stop the disc and switch to Original mode and skip ahead to same time stamp and play it the audio plays there fine. Does anyone elses do this?

Now these aren't long glitches or anything, Only a breif few seconds here and there on different discs i play but to me a ""remastered"" and enhanced audio and video should be perfect throughout and not cut out at all. Now maybe my discs are defective i dunno but i have read through alot of these reviews for this same set and found others had mentioned discs glitching and skipping as well even after getting replacements like it is just a bad transfer quality they did on the blu rays with the enhancements to the audio and video. So do i try and exchange them and try another set? Or am i just going to have same issues as others no matter how many replacements i have? If it wasn't for the glitches i experience i would give this a 5 star because i really like it. But right now i am debating on just getting a refund on it and just keeping my original unremastered sd dvd set ( the old yellow blu and red cases ) because they play just fine. I'd really appreciate if some one else with the ""Blu Ray"" set can vouche if they have this issue or not as well so i can decide on my next move.

The special effects upgrade may turn off these fans who appreciate the original look of the Enterprise but I found them to be wonderfully done with just enough effects to improve the quality without turning them into Star Wars.  There's a more modern look, yes, but they also have a feel of the 60's - as if someone back then was much more skilled than others (kind of like the Dykstra of 2001) and took some time to adapt existing technology to create a realistic image.

The stories themselves still hold up to a point though the ones I thought were bad then are still bad today - they just look better.  There's a nice extra (among others) that shows how they upgraded the images and inserted the new effects.

It is easy to watch either this or the original version but we prefer the upgraded look as it makes the planets look cool. The imagery is definitely cleaner and the colors more saturated. There is a very annoying image of a film camera that pops up when the scene enters the upgraded effect mode and this is distracting.

But the Blu-Ray disks have the option to show the original graphics, although I have not tried this.

My father who has enjoyed Star Trek since it aired for the first time also agreed with my opinion on this.

It still has the thing that made the original series great: stories.  TNG and the other spin-offs had cooler effects and props, but the stories were not as good as the first two seasons of TOS.  The third season you can tell that Gene was less involved and was just trying to cash out.  He was frustrated with NBC and the studio and it shows.  This was the first American TV show that actually took Sci-Fi seriously and didn't treat it as ridiculous ""theatre of the absurd"".

I realize that some people may be perturbed by this, since they feel the original effects were good enough, but the new effects, combined with what appears to be cleaned up other scenes, make this set a gem.

I have literally seen the original episodes hundreds of times, but it has been quite some time since I viewed them.  As another reviewer said, they have great messages, but more importantly, they are much better television than I ever realized.  There is drama, incredible humor, beautiful music, and other features which make me want to watch these episodes again and again.  And this is what I intend to do.

As a long time trekker, I believe that all of the series were excellent in their own way, but TOS stands out for me as the best.  Since it was so long ago, there wasn't any need to rely on fancy special effects (which is ironic because that is how this remastered set defines itself), so the stories were just magnificent.  Some notable ones:

1. 'City on the Edge of Forever' - who can forget the scene when Kirk finds out McCoy has reached the time period he is in and how he runs to greet him, which leads to the death of Edith Keeler.  Simply masterful TV.

2. 'Mirror, Mirror' - a neat and fun episode which opened up the entire world of the alternate universe.  The subtle sexual overtones between several of the characters, including Marlene Moreau, are great.

3. 'The Ultimate Computer' - a timely review of the importance (and dangers) of computers.  Little did the writer of this episode know how things would turn out 40 years later!

4. 'The Doomsday Machine' - One of my favorites, if not the least for the superb performance of William Windom as Commodore Decker.  Tremendous drama and suspense in an episode which didn't even feature any alien lifeforms.

I could go on and on for hours about how great these episodes are.  Just know that while they were always great, the remastered set has elevated these to a new level.  And for that reason, we get to enjoy them over and over again.",1384732800,8,2168,4.555555555555555

I heard that the new show was coming about space travel and I was captivated by the stories, the ship and the technologies presented. Gene Rodenberry's vision was unique and very forward thinking. (My parents even liked some of the episodes.)
I was skeptical about buying the DVDs as I already had all of the VCR tapes of all 79 episodes and thought I did not need to duplicate them. The price for a the DVDs for a season had always been prohibitive as well.
I finally saw a great price on Amazon for the set of all three seasons and decided to get them. The enhanced set of DVDs is marvelous. The Enterprise (always one of my favorites spaceships) looks so much better, the planets look like planets, the special effects in general are done so well and add so much to the viewing pleasure that I cannot do anything but recommend buying the three season set.

What were they thinking?  They even replaced close-up shots of Sulu's console with a computer-generated digital chronometer because they apparently weren't happy with the original film of a chronometer that used rotating drums with the digits on them like some old alarm clocks used in the 60's and 70's.  Yes, I was there when the show aired on NBC originally.  And I have seen the originals many times in syndicated reruns.  And yes, I can spot every crappy ""enhancement"" they did.  They even redid the theme music.  Although they at least tried to recreate the original orchestration, it still isn't quite the same, but I guess they just had to have a surround sound track instead of the original monaural recording.  Why, oh why, couldn't they just clean up the film and leave things alone!?!?!?  This is horrible.  I feel like burning the DVD's and mourning the death of the original series of Star Trek.

306438,5,6300988600,"For years I hesitated about buying this item. The reviews were generally good but the bad ones kept me from buying. The prior bad reviews focused on the poor packaging and the fact that the first season is two sided with an obsolete format on one side.
  Then last week it went on sale for under $70.  That was a price I could not resist.
  Based on the bad reviews I was expecting flimsy packaging that would be difficult to handle and would not last long, and that the disks were in individual paper sleeves. I was very pleasantly surprised to find these bad reviews were wrong.  Could the packaging have been better. Yes. Is it bad, no. Each season's container stands with stability on its' own.  It protects the DVDs. The disks are NOT in individual paper sleeves. They are in a hinged plastic holder similar to other multi- disk sets I own. This is housed in what I consider a sturdy cardboard receptacle that is in turn housed in larger hinged box that is shown in the item description.
  Contrary to the bad reviws the packaging is does the job nicely. Although as I said at the beginning the packing could be better, I have no complaints.
  I like the remastering and SF upgrades a lot.
  I wish reviewers would focus on the product itself rather than superfluous irrelevancies, unless such are truly bad enough to mention.

Some commented that they preferred to have the old version with all of its flaws. Well, that's on the discs as well as the digitally-enhanced version.

Other people have done a masterful detailed description of the contents. I would have liked more background of Star Trek features included, but, in the nearly 50 years since its broadcast there have been galaxies of such discussions composed and still available with a minimum of effort on the intertubes whatchamacallit. I can easily find detailed synopses of the episodes elsewhere, and Wikipedia and IMDB can provide other details not found in the disc cases. There's no pleasing the people who want a multimedia Star Trek encyclopedia included in the set. I'm quite contented with googling for content.

The disc cases were sturdy and the discs secure and in good condition. The video was crisp, the audio was clear. And, most importantly for me, the closed captions are accurate with only brief omissions of dialogue, but dramatically better than discs of more recent movies and series.

It's a good buy.",1378857600,4,1206,4.873170731707317
306459,5,6300988600,"As a lifelong fan of Star Trek The Original series, I can say that as a Trekkie (yes I'm not afraid to call myself that) I was concerned when I heard that a digital reworking of the space and special effect scenes had been done. For years now I have labored over whether I should buy the newly refreshed set or not. It's one thing to clean up original films and crispen up their color palettes and improve the soundtracks, its something else altogether to change the extremely recognizable if not always revered historical context of an iconic show such as Star Trek. Other icons like Star Wars episodes 4,5 and 6 and E.T. received reworkings and they fell flatter than a pancake, after all.

Well, finally I gave in, and WOW am I happy that I did. The people at Paramount have gone to great pains to brag about certain space scene heavy episodes such as Balance Of Terror, The Corbomite Manuever and of course, The Doomsday Machine, and yet, while those shows do wow on a whole new level with the new treatment, there are countless other moments that are smaller in scale that ad to the experience. It's amazing the effects we take for granted today in other movies and even the Star Trek Universe. This new rendering of the classic show now finally measures up to it's other TV show siblings, most notably, Next Generation.

Each of the planets is now completely unique and we get multiple angles rather than the same orbit angle seen again and again. Ship manuevers during movement and battles is more realistic. Thankfully, they didn't change the transporter beam sequences, but they did provide more accurate settings for the show's stars to beam into. Those familiar with the lustrous but one dimensional paintings that were provided as occasional backdrops will be awestruck at their newfound three dimensional realism.

Even simple touches like in Amok Time, when Spock is looking at a picture of T'pring as a child on his monitor, adding the outdoor background of Vulcan complete with other Vulcans adds to the realism of the tumultuous time Spock is going through in contrast to the original photo with a flat, grey background that appeared to have been taken against one of the enterprise walls (and probably was, budgets being so short and all). That small touch and several others like it are things that as a Trekkie you may not have even considered before, but they add a welcome warmth. Even Mr. Sulu's analog 1960's clock radio style chronometer gets a modern refresher.

There is little doubt that Roddenberry himself would find all of the work done on his iconic show to be a welcome update, as he was thrilled when The Next Generation hit the airwaves. Sure, the space and special effects scenes are secondary to the overall plots that involve facets far more important that have to do with events, consequences, struggles, humbling, and triumphs of humanity, but The Next Generation proved that you could have all of that and still do incredible effects. Indeed, if Gene had the budget and if it were possible to achieve this level of effects when the show was created, he surely would have done it this way.

One thing that should have been left alone however, is the theme in the opening credits of season 2 and 3. The woman they chose to re-do the operatic theme has a lovely voice, but it is jarring to so change the theme. You wouldn't think something could be so obtrusive, but it is. The first season's opening theme update was beautifully rendered in modern tone and clarity, however.

All in all, the changes offered us were welcome ones that make going where no man has gone before a completely new and vivid experience all over again. Beam me up, Scotty!",1378857600,4,3686,4.689335394126739

Why is it with about the same number of episodes is The Munsters, Bewitched, or Hogan's Hero's etc 1/2 to 1/10 the the cost of Star Trek? It's because they can... I just don't volunteer to be ripped off. But this New Set is much more affordable (but still on the high side). They've really cleaned up the picture though, and done a lot of work. Every episode is rich and colorful. At first I was wary about the updated special effects... but the vast majority of them are an improvement of the dated and grainy orignals.

It's fun, but I'm finding that the first season really makes more sense if you don't watch the whole thing in one sitting. Also, with this edition, the CGI is too much. It's obviously not part of the original footage, and you can tell. That said, they did manage to clean up the ship and outdoor footage, and that looks great. Looking at it, you almost forget that it's not a newer series.

All the cleanup has made me pay attention to little details though, that I never would have noticed before. For example, when they're on the amusement park planet. There's some red spray paint on one of the trees, and they just keep passing it. I never would have noticed that before. It's irksome. In the same episode, they keep walking on grass that's been cut. You can even see the grass trimmings under their feet. So how is it exactly, that they get to a planet where the lawn is perfect, there's obviously been lawn mowers running through there, and yet, they keep trying to convince themselves there's no life! It blows my mind.

The other thing they did was include both pilots. And while the third episode isn't a pilot, it sort of feels like one.

Biggest problem with this high quality remix of classic trek is that the sets look cheesier, and the monsters look more plastic like then they ever have.

One of the things that astonishes me is the relevance and excellence of the scripts.  Also, how similar Gene Roddenberry was to Rod Serling in setting controversial topics in another world (or universe) in order to say what he wanted to say. It is also interesting to see the influence of Rod Serling and Gene Roddenberry in the more recent Sci-Fi television series (just cancelled), FRINGE.  What I love about all three in the lack of moral equivalency.  Good is good.  Bad is bad.  And never the twain shall meet.

Although the entire cast is terrific, there is no question that William Shatner's and Leonard Nemoy's intensity and brillirant acting gave the show its vitality and made it such a phenomenon.  The series appears to be beautifully restored.  And from Season Two on, the intros have been pepped up with a new recording of the theme and restoration of Captain Kirk's original voiceover.

306545,5,6300988600,"I have been a long time Star Trek fan, and this is the first time I have purchased a set for the original series.  It was well worth it!  I won't go into too much detail, but I have a few things to point out.

First, there are basically a few options - you can watch the original version in either original mono or updated stereo sound.  Or you can watch a newer rendered version with improved backgrounds and animations (due to computer CG overlay).  Also with either original or stereo sound.

For the naysayers, the new computer rendering was based on original models and drawings for the show.  The team responsible for the newer renderings were original Star Trek designers who have worked on nearly every Star Trek show (you always notice Micheal Okuda at the credits?  Yeah, his team).  So you don't have Paramount sourcing some odd company for the CG rendering, instead you have a 40+ veteran of the series working on it.

My one complaint is that you cannot bookmark your spot and change from the old to new rendering on the fly.  Instead you have to start the episode over again and forward to the part.  I actually recommend watching the entire series in the original style then watching it through with the new renderings.  That way you can see both versions.

It's an amazing series, arguably as good as the later Star Trek series, although Picard was my favorite captain!  It's worth the price for any fan of the series.  If you have the series on DVD already, it might be worth checking this out for the interesting little finishing touches put on with the new CG rendering and updating.  I feel it's what they would have done if they had the technology or the budget.  Since all the updates are based on the original set design and artwork, it is at least sticking to the original concept.  Not like the Star Wars re-makes.

306626,4,6300988600,"Seeing ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" on blu ray complete with new digital effects breathes new life into an old classic, however, it was also very smart of the people behind this restoration and enhancement of all three seasons of ""ST:TOS"" to give viewers the option to view episodes with the original effects if they so choose. Personally, I really like the new effects, feeling it gives the entire series a consistency with the other series that followed. Unfortunately, no special effect is going to improve ""the cheese factor"" of just how cheap and cardboard-like in appearance many of the sets appear as well as the fact that one can now clearly see details not meant to be visible on much smaller, non-HD tv screens from the 1960's, such as a stray piece of thread sticking out from a costume or a spot on the floor of the Enterprise bridge or the corridor set where someone spilled some coffee or a bit of sandwich found its way to the floor to leave a permanent stain. One can only assume that some greater care was taken with the sets on the subsequent series. (I have yet to see similar ""marks"" on the floor of sets from ""ST: The Next Generation"" on blu-ray.) Also, the enhanced special effects are not going to improve some of the classically awful episodes of ""ST:TOS"". (Season Three, I was reminded, is ripe with them. I used to think ""Spock's Brain"" was the absolute worst of the series until I viewed again for the first time in decades, ""The Way of Eden"", in which Capt. James ""Herbert"" Kirk has to contend with space hippies. That one gets my vote for THE worst episode of the entire series. Other episodes that are still pretty bad but not nearly as grating are fun to see on blu-ray and the better episodes, particularly the ones that are ""effects-heavy"" such as ""The Doomsday Machine"", ""The Immunity Syndrome"" and ""Elaan of Troyius"" are a delight, particularly when we are given close-up views of ships and seeing them maneuvering during battle. If you are a fan, (I hesitate to use the moniker of ""Trekkie"" or even ""Trekker"" as it has taken on such a negative connotation to many people), this set is strongly recommended.",1373328000,2,2146,4.635170603674541

306628,3,6300988600,"I am happy receiving the blu ray version of Star Trek Original Series.
I am just watching the very first episode.

The only thing I want to mention is that I guess due to the fact it is so old, they could not manage to get it fit a bigger screen. I have a 58 TV and the picture of Star Trek misses like 10 cm on each side.
I also had to put up the volume on kinda the highest on my tv as the sound is quite low. If I would watch the episodes on a normal volume, I would not really hear much. The sound gets back to the old version sometimes. It has interruptions few times inbetween. So you get the old sound effect lots of time.

So far, I am not disappointed in purchasing it. The picture quality is really fine for such an old TV Show.",1373241600,2,738,3.848684210526316

Ordered by ""Official"" air date, meaning, ""The Cage"" (the original and later scrapped pilot is not included). It is revived however in the 2 part episode ""The Menagerie"". Lots of bonuses and it contains 2 versions of each episode. the originals with original sound and special effects and the new enhanced versions with updated sound and special effects much like The Next Generation type effects but not overdone. As a fan who watched the original series with my dad on an old black and white TV I actually prefer the enhanced versions. They are breathtaking. I really think it is the way Gene Roddenberry would have wanted it.

I have only one small nit-pick. You can only choose 2 sound options, original mono or enhanced 7.1 DTS surround so my lonely 5.1 surround system gives me weird issues like sudden quiet dialog or blazing loud music at sporadic moments. Probably signals it cannot handle. I have to use my Blu-Ray players built in encoder to re-encode it to Dolby 5.1 and still there are some weird things that happen. Mono is fine though but the enhanced sound is preferred.

306740,5,6300988600,"...And so it was. And this sharp collection is wonderful. If anything, the crystal clear Blue-ray renditions of Star Trek's early days was a jolt, which had me seeing episode progressions in a new light. I have most of the orange DVD set of the Kirk years. They were nice - 'fun'- but this New Millennium look provided a whole new element and appreciation of the early days and clues to what's ahead.

This fine set's new Blu-ray presentation steals the show; in a way it highlights the (sorry, no dissing intended) naive scripting and sets, not to mention the go-go uniforms and hair do's; but they're okay, it shows the progression which led to The Next Generation and...

What's next? 3D renditions? Actual Star Fleet true adventures? Explorations? Discoveries? The JJ Abrams movies are certainly part of the progress which's now 50 years+.

I'm in my 70's and of all the TV I've seen (alot!), no series engaged me as far as all the Star Trek's have (all two of them, so far) both in concept and execution. Optimistic, idealistic, positively humanistic; all on a path to human-kind's best times: Future times. Thanks Gene Roddenberry and the long list of fine actors, designers, writers, directors, producers and crews who made the legend come alive so excitingly, so beautifully, so positively.

Yes, I've signed up for the Blu-ray collection of Star Trek The New Generation when it's released. (The sign-up list is coming to Amazon! Soon? I hope so.)

And when the another generation of Star Trek comes to be, I hope I'll enjoy that one too. And the next? That would be pushing it for me at my age; but Star Trek's proven the worth of dreaming, yes?

Don't we all hope there will be many Star Trek series ahead? Well into even farther futures, maybe a future actually with star dates? Why not? I hope I'll be around to see them all. I can only imagine how good they'll be and the technologies which will convey them.

Nice touch in that you can view either with the original or the new special effects. So if you are a purist you can be happy to view them as they were originally made, in all their HD glory. I like most of what they did with the revised effects with a few minor quibbles. The Doomsday Machine is a standout as an effects-heavy episode, we now have a proper ship not a half melted AMT model.

The one thing I do not like is the Menus which are confusing and a little ugly. I REALLY liked the old DVD ""Bridge"" menu which was simple and beautiful.

306871,5,6300988600,"Pardon me if I disagree with some of you, but in regard to STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES, for me the difference between regular DVD and blu-ray high definition was not only big, it was critical.

I was eighteen when STAR TREK debuted in the fall of 1966, and I have seen every episode so many times I have lost count. The last time, a few years ago, STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES rewarded me with a tolerable though not especially uplifting experience on regular DVD. Grainy cinematography, antiquated special effects, antiquated computer technology, antiquated acting...everything was just too doggone OLD. Believing that I would never again want to watch the original series, I sold my set to a second-hand store. Even after the entire series had been released on blu-ray, I was not interested. Initially.

But with the recent blu-ray releases of the first season of ENTERPRISE and more blu-ray releases of NEXT GENERATION, I took a peek at some recent reviews for the original series. Looking only at the ones for the blu-ray releases, they were almost all commendatory. Some were well written, in polished prose and without ostentatious language. I respect that, and the reviewers conveyed truthfulness. But for the original series? That threadbare thing that only sentimentalists and fanatics deem praiseworthy? The reviews were hard to believe.

Nevertheless, they persuaded me to buy the complete original series in blu-ray.

Indeed! The laudatory reviews were justified. It was like watching the original series for the first time. Everything was so impressive I felt like giving my screen a hug. Enhanced sequences that show the ENTERPRISE orbiting alien worlds are cinematically state-of-the-art. And even though the sets are still made of papier-mache boulders and the computer technology is ancient, they become tolerable because the bright colors, sharp resolution, and digital sound elevate everything to a higher level of life. This creates deeper immersion, which incredibly enough seems even to have improved the acting.

At least for me, STAR TREK has been resurrected.",1369008000,29,2089,5.24251497005988

Damn I'm glad I did.  The BluRay set looks and sounds GREAT!  And, on top of that, this set works for both purists and those of us who enjoy the ""remastered"" versions as you get BOTH!

So, I was SHOCKED when I watched these episodes and LOVED them!  How is this possible?  First, unlike George Lucas going in and digitally altering storylines, these stories remain the same with absolutely NO changes.  The only changes are an updating of the special effects shots.  But even those are faithful and true to the series.  And the picture quality has been beautifully remastered.

The way I see it, if today's technology existed at the time Star Trek was aired this is what the show would have looked like.  So it's not anything new, just an enhancement.  Because of this I can give the remastered Star Trek TOS five stars!",1368489600,7,878,4.593548387096774

306928,3,6300988600,"I have been waiting for this product and this is my first and last purchase for the legindary series.  I do like the new effects but I have noticed some issues with this product, first and foremost was the sound levels.  Not in all episodes, but in a few I have noticed the sound levels seem to change from time to time.  I still wish there was a Disc feature PLAY ALL like I have seen on other series.

The whole Star Date vs Air Date viewing seems to be a little dramatic to me, becasue you will have to switch DVD's to watch by STAR DATE, so I won't be going there anytime soon.

The packaging is good, but Im a little concerned that Season 3 could not have been in the same size case as seasons 1 and 2.  It seems a little odd on the shelf if you ask me.

I am a fan of the remastered effects, I think that is how it would have been done given the budget.  I also like the price of the set and although I have given a few points I wish they could have improved, none of that really matters if your a fan.

306932,5,6300988600,"First off, this set is worth every penny spent on it. If you grew up with this series on network TV in your living room, seeing it now new and improved is nothing less than revelatory. For all its strengths and weaknesses each episode has something to offer, even the most obviously camp (Spock's Brain) or bluntly in-your-face (Patterns of Force, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield). Turnabout Intruder (the final episode) is fantastically over-the-top (to see William Shatner possessed by the spirit/essence of a psychotic woman, you can't do better)! Some of my favorite moments - the final 5 minutes of The Paradise Syndrome (the only episode in the series to end as such); Spock's crafty relationship with the Romulan commander in The Enterprise Incident; Merrick's sudden change of heart at the end of Bread and Circuses; Kirk's psych-out of Nomad in The Changeling; the whole creepy aura running throughout ""Return of the Archons"" and ""Miri""; the phenomenal Doomsday Machine and the tragic yet noble self-sacrifice of Commodore Dekker...the list goes on. The transfers are eye-popping overall. The price might be high, but the care taken to make this a top-quality product almost seems justified.

One thing that oddly enough is credited to Star Trek is the first interracial kiss - as the Amazon reviewer described, ""The first interracial kiss on network primetime TV (between Shatner and series co-star Nichelle Nichols) furthered a richly positive and expansive view of a better, nobler future for humankind"". The episode was Plato's Stepchildren, and Kirk and Uhura were forced to kiss by the telekinetic Platonians as part of a continuous sequence of degradation and demoralization. Neither Kirk nor Uhura enjoyed the experience (which is very obvious if you see the episode). So the Amazon reviewer either hasn't seen Plato's Stepchildren, or thinks that a better, nobler future for humankind includes forced interracial sexual overtures?",1368144000,3,1950,5.25

306974,5,6300988600,"I admittedly watched Star Trek: The Next Generation growing up, off and on but would never have called myself a ""Trekker"" until fairly recently. I got Netflix a few years back and went through all of the TNG episodes and movies. After finishing those, I felt compelled to see where it all started. Still, I wasn't interested enough to sit down and watch TOS. I instead rediscovered a love for older Sci-Fi, revisiting classic B movies and shows like The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery. After a few months of really appreciating the creativity and HUGE ideas conquered by this genre, I felt well prepared to dip my toe in the Trek origins, I was not dissapointed.

First, let me say this: TOS is not about action, it has some pretty dated effects and costumes, the acting styles are very much influenced by classical training, and the suspension of disbelief is required frequently. If any of those things are ""deal-breakers"" for you, just skip this all-together; you will not enjoy the series and your negative opinion of it may dissuade others from checking it out.

TOS IS about philosophy, science, discovery, human emotion, love, camaraderie, loyalty, duty, and self sacrifice. TOS tackles very big ideas, concepts, and philosophies and often times leaves the conclusion to the viewer. The biggest draw to the show is probably the themes and issues that they tackle but a close runner-up is the on-screen chemistry of the cast. Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty are an incredible team and they play off one another perfectly.

That is really all you need to know in order to determine if you want to watch this show but I will go ahead and make a recommendation if you are completely new to Trek and want to know where to start. If you are younger, <35, I say start this way:

1. Watch the new Star Trek Movie (2009) first to introduce you to the characters in a way that is action packed and fun
2. From here you can go back and Start TOS
3. Don't watch the Star Trek Movies until you have finished TOS, but once you have, watch them in order up THROUGH Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and stop.
4. Now watch Star Trek TNG all the way to the end before watching any of the other movies
5. Watch the remaining 4 films after seeing all of TNG.
6. At this point you are caught up and can watch DS9, Voyager, or Enterprise in any order, if you wish but I highly recommend re-watching the new Star Trek Movie after having seen TOS and all the movies, it will give you a different perspective on it. Oh and then you can watch Star Trek: Into the Darkness, assuming you do all this after May 17, 2013.

A HEADS UP ON TOS:
The series starts off with a pilot episode and you will be confused if you aren't forewarned; The episode has Chris Pike as captain and the entire command crew is different. This pilot was rejected by the network and another one was commissioned. The second episode is actually the real ""first"" episode. Don't skip the pilot though, as it is a great episode and Captain Christopher Pike is mentioned later in the series.",1367884800,2,3045,4.519056261343013

Those unfamiliar with this series should not be deterred from buying it, because you saw one of the later Star Trek series with a different cast.  All the later Star Trek series and movies were abominations and an outrageous insult to the original series.  Only, the original series was truly ""original"" and a masterpiece.

The planetary props and skies have not been touched, and look as cheesy as ever, and the remastered looks from space look amazing on a plasma tv. I was very impressed with the ""galaxy edge"" in Where No Man Has Gone Before.
 I do not feel it takes away from the show nor does it disrespect the vision of Gene Roddenberry in anyway. It gives Trek a legitimacy it never could have achieved in the 60's with the limited budget.

307034,5,6300988600,"ABOUT ME AS A FAN:  I turned 15 the month TOS began in 1966.  During its first season, it ran on Thursday nights against two of my mother's favorite shows, Bewitched and That Girl on ABC.  Being a one-television family, my mom always won control of the TV.  TOS moved to Friday nights for seasons two and three.  Since by then I had turned 16 and gotten my driver's license, I was rarely home on Friday nights, and if I was for some reason, I would watch something else.

So, for various reasons, I didn't see TOS during its original run.  However, in 1972, after I got out of the Army ('69-'71), I began watching TOS in syndication and became a fan of the show.  Through the years, I considered purchasing the series, first on VHS and later on DVD, but didn't do it.  I could not see paying the price asked for the series when I had seen all the episodes over the years.  But, when I saw TOS (remastered) in syndication on TV in 2006, I decided I would eventually get TOS on DVD.  Up until recently, I thought the remastered series was too pricey.  I thought I might get it when it got down under a hundred dollars from AMAZON LLC.  Well, about a week ago I received it from AMAZON LLC for $98.06.

MY EQUIPMENT:  I am playing the DVDs on a Sony Upscaling DVD Player I purchased back in 2010 connected to my 2 year old 32"" Samsung HD TV in my home office.  I usually sit between 5 and 6 feet away from the screen.

THE DVD SET:  The packaging is not very good as others have noted, so I won't bother with that aspect of the set.  All the DVDs ""look like"" double-sided discs, but as I understand it, that's because season one discs are double-sided (HDTV/STDTV) and the manufacturer wanted all the discs to look alike even though seasons two and three discs are single-sided.  I have randomly loaded and played 4 or 5 discs from season one and 2 discs each from seasons two and three.  All those that I tried loaded and played fine.  They all play with the little white ring with black lettering facing up.

The image quality if outstanding and I like the CGI stuff, especially those scenes with the starship orbiting around the beautiful planets.

I have only two complaints.  Number one, during the beginning of each episode of season one, when Kirk gives his ""Space: The Final Frontier."" intro, the music (which I like) is nice and loud but Kirk sounds like he's deep inside a cave with his hand over his mouth.  The intro in seasons two and three seem fine.  Number two, and there is simply NO EXCUSE for this, no English subtitles.  Fortunately, the characters' voices are pretty clear.  For those who are a little hard of hearing like me (I have ringing 24/7), you might consider wireless headphones.  They've helped me . . . a lot!  I don't use mine all the time, but for those shows where the music and/or sound effects tend to drown out dialogue, they're GREAT.

So, I got the original 79 episodes plus the two versions of The Cage, a total of 80 shows, from a very reliable seller with an excellent return policy for $98.06 or a little less than $1.23 per show, not counting all the extras.

Audio is OK, the menus are average, and the second season (at least) has those infuriating previews you have to sit or fast forward trough to get to the episodes themselves.

That being said, there is not too much a bona fide trekkie like me can add: the new effects are less jarring than I thought they would be, and many of the episodes hold up surprisingly well even today - the writing was tighter, as the stories had to focus on the human element, instead of shoveling down special effects down the viewers throat on every single frame, as much of today's scifi seems to be about.

Overall, a nice addition to my Star Trek shelf.

They even added a few touches (such as the Gorn's eyes blinking) to add more realism to the viewing experience. You also get the original pilot, The Cage with the original script which was never aired, and the Menagerie which was aired as part of the original series with or without updated effects.

307251,5,6300988600,"If you even half-way care about Star Trek you will love this product.

Best Features:
1. This version was taken from the original film and cleaned up considerably. It's a beautiful transfer.
2. Yes, they have enhanced the old special effects with new CGI technology but it looks much better and more natural then what George Lucas did to the original Star Wars Trilogy. It simply takes the original look of the Enterprise and spruces it up a bit. They even recreated the original theme with a new orchestra but you can hardly tell the difference. I realize some of you purists will still have a problem with this but not to worry you can select to view each episode with the original effects and mono sound recording.
3. This blue-ray set comes with the original preview for each episode. It's like stepping back into the past and catching a glimpse of how the original Treckies heard news of each episode week by week.
4. As I hoped The last disc of season three contains both the original rough cut and the spruced-up colorized version of the unaired pilot, The Cage. I love Star Trek but I wonder if it might had been better if Roddenberry had been allowed to follow his initial conception of the show.
5. Something I was not expecting, season 2 contains an entire disc dedicated to the tribbles. It even has the DS9 cross-over episode and an episode from the animated series. I was never able to watch more than one episode of the animated series and this feature has perked my interest and I plan to get the show on bl-ray when it becomes available.
6. And of course like any good series collection this is filled with commentaries and specials.

I can't imagine why anyone would dislike this blu-ray collection. It's a must have for all hard-core or even soft-core Sci-Fi fans. Mine arrived yesterday and I still have a high from it.",1360368000,3,1839,4.569696969696969

This concern is with wasted time and energy exchanging this boxed set, because the first season was missing its cardboard sleeve cover and artwork -- I got a new one with the same problem.  This time I went back to the photo on Amazon and noticed that there was no sleeve pictured on the first season.  I called Amazon and was informed that the manufacturer no longer ships the set with the artwork included on the first season.  WHY???????  As Mr. Spock might say, ""it defies logic!""  At least I should have been informed of this fact before going through an entire, needless exchange.  The discs work fine; there are no problems with how they play, and the remastering and other improvements, plus all the extras, make this series well worth having.  It costs less to buy it as a complete package than to get the seasons individually, but DVD collectors like me want to see the things we spend so much money on be complete and as flawless as possible.  I just wanted to alert other buyers to this irritating little glitch. I've seen Star Trek the First Season in stores, and by itself it has the slip cover.

307300,5,6300988600,"I was just a kid when Star Trek debuted in the fall of 1966. When I was just 7 years of age, the final episode aired in 1969. I still have a few warm and fuzzy memories of sitting in our living room, with my Banquet TV dinner and glass of ice tea, and watching this show on a big RCA black and white television. Even in black and white, the show had a magical quality that made it stand out from most other fare. I was certainly too young at the time to grasp all the sociopolitical undercurrents in the storyline, but I was perfectly happy to gaze at all the imaginary alien worlds and wonderful gizmos. And don't even get me started on all the pretty girls..Barbara Luna (""Mirror, Mirror"") and Marianna Hill (""Dagger of the Mind"")...yum, yum!

Well, enough of the trip down memory lane. I sort of lost touch with Star Trek in the 70's, but watched the reruns whenever I could, although I never became a 'trekkie'. I liked the show, but not THAT much. Like many, my interest was renewed when the motion pictures began to revive the series with the first movie in 1979. CBS/Paramount has done a wonderful job of bringing the original TV show back to life with these remastered versions. Everything looks so crisp and clear. I know many die-hard Trek fans had issues with the digitally enhanced effects, but I thought they looked quite stunning....darn near cinema quality in some episodes. There is, however, an eerie sort of disconnect with this. You'll see the Enterprise, looking better than it ever looked when the show aired in the 60's, floating majestically in space, and then a switch inside to those same cheesy interior sets. There just wasn't much the special effects wizards could do with the rather Spartan corridors and control panels. That not withstanding, everything looks far, far better than it ever did when the show first aired. Especially the alien planets and landscapes. The show is more enjoyable to me now than it was years ago. Not because of Roddenberry's progressive political themes, but because it all looks so much better. My only gripe, and it's minor, is one pointed out by others...the sound at times seems a bit screwy. I don't have a fancy 'surround sound' system, just the speakers on the TV. The strange effect I speak of is especially noticeable in the very beginning of each episode...""Space, the final frontier..."", that famous prologue as spoken by Bill Shatner. But it sounds like he's in another room while the theme music nearly drowns him out. There's really no way to compensate for it unless you switch to mono. A simple 'stereo' setting would have been nice.

The packaging is a bit heavy, with its awkward clam shell cases, but it seems sturdy and well made. All the DVD's have lots of extras, not just the actual episodes, so there's lots of material here to go through. I've only made it through the first season, and that took me all weekend! All things considered, this was a solid purchase and I'm quite pleased. This remastered boxed set should be an absolute must for all serious fans of the original Star Trek series.",1358726400,4,3076,4.6422018348623855
307361,2,6300988600,"This review is for the ""Remastered DVD Edition of the Original TV series"". I recently purchased this from FYE store and I am disappointed. Whereas the picture quality is much better than the 2004 edition, it is missing some essential features:

1) No English subtitles - I am not sure why there are no English subtitles. I think it's excusable not to have English subtitles. 2004 edition does have English subtitles.

2) Discs have no labels. You cannot tell which episodes are on the disc. I was confused if the discs were two-sided or not. 2004 edition discs were very nice. They actually had photos and the list of all 4 episodes contained on the disc.

3) I think the 2004 packaging was much nicer. The outer shell was nicer looking.

I will be returning this and probably purchase the Blu-ray release when its price drops to a level that I can afford. I hope the Blu-ray release doesn't lack the above features.

Special features are decent, the transfer from the original film to Blu-Ray is great, and watching the episodes with new special effects brings out a new dimension. Negatives: while the packing is sturdy, you have to remove discs to see the lists of episodes, as they're printed on the inside cover of the box, hidden by the discs. And, in the 3-set I received, the Season 3 box is slimmer than Seasons 1 and 2, so it looks odd on the bookshelf.

Well, I still think it's corny and campy but now, in a good way and I'm now a fan as well. The remastering is truly well done. The images are now (according to the original people who were working on them) closer to what they wanted to achieve. The special effects have been revamped and even though my fan of a hubby thinks that it sometime takes away from the whole thing, I think it adds quite a bit.

307414,5,6300988600,"Star Trek TOS on Blu-ray is so easy to recommend it's actually embarrassing, but one of the more persistent and valid criticisms of TOS over the years is the lack of continuity between episodes, or even the 3 seasons themselves, and this is understandable, because even though much of the writing and set-ups are very sophisticated, these were simpler times. Other than daytime soaps - for some reason&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peyton-Place-Part-One/dp/B001O4KBNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peyton Place: Part One</a>&nbsp;springs to mind! LOL! - there were no ""story arcs"" or grand designs, and given the economics of TV production at the time, it was easier to schedule, and then sell/syndicate a show, if it was in a simple threat/monster/problem-of-the-week format.

After years of watching the show in production and/or transmission order, I decided to do something different and watch the season episodes in order of Star Date, so, if you decide you'd like to play along, here they are...

Season 1: Where No Man Has Gone Before, Mudd's Women, The Corbomite Maneuver, The Man Trap, Charlie X, The Enemy Within, The Naked Time, Balance Of Terror, The Squire Of Gothos, What Are Little Girls Made Of? Miri, Dagger Of The Mind, The Conscience Of The King, The Galileo Seven, Court Martial, The Menagerie parts 1 & 2, Shore Leave, Arena, The Alternative Factor, Tomorrow Is Yesterday, The City On The Edge Of Forever, Space Seed, The Return Of The Archons, A Taste Of Armageddon, The Devil In The Dark, Errand Of Mercy, Operation: Annihilate! and, This Side Of Paradise.

Season 2: Patterns Of Force, Catspaw, The Gamesters Of Triskelion, Metamorphosis, Amok Time, Who Mourns For Adonais, The Deadly Years, Fridays Child, The Changeling, Wolf In The Fold, Obsession, The Apple, Journey To Babel, Bread And Circuses, The Doomsday Machine, A Private Little War, The Immunity Syndrome, I Mudd, The Trouble With Tribbles, A Piece Of The Action, By Any Other Name, The Ultimate Computer, Return To Tomorrow, Mirror Mirror, The Omega Glory, and, Assignment: Earth.

Season 3: Elaan Of Troyius, Spectre Of The Gun, The Paradise Syndrome, The Enterprise Incident, And The Children Shall Lead, The Empath, The Mark Of Gideon, Spock's Brain, For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky, Is There In Truth No Beauty, The Tholian Web, Wink Of An Eye, Whom Gods Destroy, The Lights Of Zetar, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, Plato's Stepchildren, The Cloud Minders, The Way To Eden, Requiem For Methuselah, The Savage Curtain, Turnabout Intruder, All Our Yesterdays, Day Of The Dove, and, That Which Survives. The Season 3 set also contains two different versions of the original pilot, The Cage.

If you are reading this review, but have never actually seen TOS - is that even possible?!?!?! - be aware... MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!

The biggest downside to watching in the Star Date format is that it involves a fair amount of disc swapping; the first 3 episodes of Season 1, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" ""Mudd's Women,"" and ""The Corbomite Maneuver,"" are on discs 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and you then go back to disc 1 for ""The Man Trap,"" and ""Charlie X.""

Watching by Star Date also throws up some interesting anomalies and juxtapositions. In Season 1 for instance, the transition between the hard Sci-Fi drama of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" and the comedic stylings of ""Mudd's Women,"" thanks to the sly and playful performance of Roger C. Carmel as Harcourt Fenton Mudd, is pretty jarring if watched back-to-back! You then have ""Court Martial,"" in which Kirk is, well, court martialed, for the apparent death of a junior officer, followed immediately by ""The Menagerie parts 1 & 2,"" in which Spock is court martialed for hijacking the Enterprise and heading off to the forbidden planet of Talos IV!

The next three episodes, ""Shore Leave,"" ""Arena,"" and, ""The Alternative Factor,"" all feature extensive location shooting which was done at Vasquez Rocks, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. The most famous of these is ""Arena,"" where Kirk has to engage the Gorn (huge lizard-guy) in hand-to-hand combat while Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew watch helplessly from the Enterprise. Immediately following these are the episodes, ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday,"" and what is considered by most to be the pinnacle of TOS, and possibly of all Trek, ""The City On The Edge Of Forever,"" both of which have time travel as their central theme.

Then we have the strange case of Nurse Chapel's affections! In the Season 1, 7th episode, ""The Naked Time,"" she professes her undying love for Spock, but just three episodes later in, ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" we discover she originally joined Star Fleet with the sole purpose of being reunited with her lost-in-space fiance, and love-of-her-life, Dr Roger Korby, soon to be exposed as having been somewhat upgraded whilst away! But never fear, dear Christine is back to pining for Spock and bringing him soup, while he slowly loses his mind, in Season 2's, ""Amok Time.""

Season 1 gets off to a fantastic start with ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" and ends on a bittersweet, even poetic note, with the final words of the season spoken by Spock, ""For the first time in my life, I was happy,"" although the episode itself, ""This Side Of Paradise,"" is a huge amount of fun as Spock loses his inhibitions, and falls in love!

Season 2 starts out strongly with ""Patterns Of Force,"" but by the Star Date given, the events of this episode actually take place between Season 1's ""The Squire Of Gothos"" and ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" Similarly the 2nd episode, ""Catspaw,"" takes place between the events of Season 1's ""The Menagerie"" and ""Shore Leave,"" the 3rd & 4th episodes, "" The Gamesters Of Triskelion"" and ""Metamorphosis,"" take place between the Season 1 episodes, ""Errand Of Mercy"" and ""Operation: Annihilate!"" and finally the 5th episode, ""Amok Time,"" actually takes place between Season 1's ""Operation: Annihilate!"" and ""This Side Of Paradise."" Note: Try watching ""Amok Time"" and ""This Side Of Paradise"" back-to-back... that's just weird!

In the second half of the season we have ""I, Mudd,"" marking the return of Season 1's ne'er-do-well titular character, the much-loved ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" and, ""A Piece Of The Action"" - which includes detailed instructions on how to play the universe's most confusing card game, ""Fizzbin!"" - all played with an emphasis on extracting as many laughs and chuckles as possible from the audience!  The last three episodes of Season 2, the superlative ""Mirror Mirror,"" ""The Omega Glory,"" and ""Assignment: Earth,"" are ""Star Date: Unknown,"" so I put them at the end of my list, although I guess you could watch them in any order you like.

And then we come to Season 3, home to what is arguably the absolute nadir of all of Trekdom, the execrable ""Spock's Brain,"" and ""The Way To Eden,"" aka, ""Space Hippies!"" But all is not lost, each season has its stand-out episodes and Season 3 is no different; everyone has their own favorites of course, but mine include the surreal western ""Spectre Of The Gun,"" ""The Enterprise Incident,"" ""The Tholian Web,"" ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" featuring a scenery-chewing performance from, Frank ""The Riddler"" Gorshin, and ""All Our Yesterdays.""

Once again we have a couple of bizarre Star Date overlaps between seasons with the weak season opener ""Elaan Of Troyius,"" and personal favorite ""Spectre Of The Gun,"" taking place between Season 2's ""The Immunity Syndrome"" and ""I, Mudd,"" with ""Day Of The Dove,"" ""That Which Survives,"" and the original pilot, ""The Cage,"" being ""Star Date: Unknown.""

END OF SPOILERS.

There are other oddities and plot elements that make you go ""huh?"" - but I'll leave them to you to find, that's part of the fun! - but as I said at the beginning of my review, this is embarrassingly easy to recommend; if you're a fan of TOS and have a Blu-ray player, buy it!!!

What you have on the discs are the original programs, cleaned up and color balanced to the point where some of the scenes look as if they were filmed only yesterday! You also have the new ""enhanced"" versions that have had the original grungy old model shots replaced by beautiful new CGI footage, including all the shots of the Bridge View Screen. From the main menu you have the option to watch the episodes with, or without the new CGI, plus you can even switch between them while you're watching the show, although I find that very distracting.

Another MILD SPOILER AHEAD!

Some of the new FX shots are positively cinematic in scope. One of the most dramatic is the scene in Season 1's ""The Galileo Seven"" where the shuttle Galileo, with Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and a few disposable ""red shirts"" aboard, takes off from the planet they were stranded on in the hopes of making orbit and being rescued by the Enterprise. For various reasons the Enterprise had been forced to leave, and in an act of desperation Spock ejects, then ignites, their remaining fuel to act as a cosmic flare, hoping to draw the attention of the ship, before they plunge back into the atmosphere and burn up. The first time I watched this I was blown away; the Galileo is seen from behind, with plumes of burning plasma(?) stretching out behind her as she arcs around the planet in a low, tight orbit... beautiful stuff!!!

END OF SPOILER.

There's also a new lossless multichannel soundtrack that puts you right in the center of the action, although not at the expense of the all-important dialog, plus you can also watch with the original Mono soundtrack if that is your wish. Also included are a seemingly endless series of extras, interviews and commentaries for those that like that sort of thing; needless to say this all makes Star Trek TOS on Blu-ray highly, HIGHLY recommended!!!",1356998400,23,9830,4.930471584038694

I guess this proves kids are so much more willing to immerse themselves in whatever they see-- as an adult I chuckle at most of the original cgs and costumes. But I still love this show and enjoy nearly every episode (of the first 2 seasons anyway, and even quite a few of season 3). The updated version is a great way for people who have never seen Star Trek to get their feet wet.

The Blu Ray disks have both the original effects, and the updated.  And, they are set to different view angles so that you can switch back and forth.  But, at least on my player, when a special effect scene is about to show up, a camera icon shows up on the screen. It is distracting.  And, perhaps this is an issue with my player that may or may not affect you - but on my player, when it comes to a special affect scene, it pauses for a second, I guess searching for the right location on the disk.  That is annoying too.

The complete reproduction of the musical score in Dolby 7.1 starting with live musicians is a nice touch. It must have been a surrealistic feeling to hear that score live in the studio after 40 years of sub-par tv sound. And the best part of this set is the inclusion of the non-enhanced original episodes to keep the purists happy, and to allow new generations to get a feel for how far we have come.

So far, I have watched mostly 2nd season episodes; a few from the 1st season; and one from the 3rd season: ""The Savage Curtain"".  Strange to see Abraham Lincoln in the ...Curtain episode.  That was a good story though. I think the best acting performance was William Windom's role as Commodore Matt Decker in the 2nd season's ""The Doomsday Machine"".  You talk about someone who was overcome with guilt and sorrow after condemning his crew to death, then finding the ultimate sacrifice in taking his own life by piloting the Enterprise's shuttlecraft 'right down the throat' of that automated robot planet killer.  Was Windom ever nominated for an Emmy award for his acting performance in that episode?  I will continue to enjoy watching the rest of the episodes.  I strongly believe that The Original Series was the best Star Trek series ever with Next Generation a close second.

The Red Alert alarm sounds as if it is coming from everywhere in the room. It includes the original and enhanced versions. (I prefer the enhanced because it does make TOS seem more up to date.) The episodes are arranged due to air date and not star date but the star dates are listed on the jackets. I always watch at least one episode of Star Trek TOS a week and will watch these from air date first and then I intend to watch in order of the star dates. I am not going to go into reviewing each episode because if you are ordering this or thinking about it you already know what you need to know about Star Trek. I have been watching for this to be on sale for about a year now, I got it for $200.00 by far the most I have ever paid for a dvd/blu-ray set but it was worth it. I have seen every episode multiple times and will see each one again multiple times. I LOVE STAR TREK!

Update: 12/31 03:29. I finished watching the entire set and all discs worked flawlessly. As I watched season 3 I wondered if the social commentary from the episodes were the series undoing. Sure many liked what they had to say but that was a different time and attitudes then were MUCH MUCH different then now. There is clearly a sexist tone the series takes (See the last episode (Turnabout Intruder)it says that women are not allowed to be captains in the Star Fleet, something that gives light to the mind of Roddenberry This is no doubt because he was a womanizer.

I am moving from this to the animated series which is a cartoon continuation of the series in every way. It is not written(the animated one)for kids (IMHO)and the fact that all but Chekov gave their voices for it makes it easy to envision the original crew members in the adventures. Since this is going to be the highest quality Star Trek TOS version for sometime all Star Trek fans should take the plunge and buy this from Amazon right now.

Paramount's quality control on this must have consisted of that gorilla we used to see in that ad tossing the American Tourister luggage around.

Even when I'm not trying to fall asleep, it becomes a tedious exercise having to go back to the main menu and and scroll though the options, etc.  The picture is fantastic and I dig the special effects enhancements they added, but they are wasted, because I NEVER watch these discs anymore because it's such a pain in the ass!

307588,4,6300988600,"I found no quality control problems as described by some other reviewers. So far I have watched all of the first two seasons, and every episode played just fine. I also like the enhancements in the video; in my opinion they look good and don't interfere with the plots or feeling of the originals. (of course, at the beginning of every episode you get to choose the original or enhanced version)

As other reviewers have noted, the documentation is poor. The disks are only labeled 1, 2, 3, etc. To see which episodes are on them, you have to read the inside of the box (not even a separate card). There was not enough room inside the boxes for the first two seasons, so the last few disks were a mystery until I played them.

One bonus is on the disk with ""Trouble with Tribbles."" That disk also has the Deep Space Nine sequel of ""Trials and Tribbilations"", in Blu-Ray. Very nice.

To the good, the episodes are in the correct order.

There is a difference between season 1 and the other two. I do not have an expensive Blu-Ray player, and it has trouble with Java programming. The first season was great, I could hit the STOP button, and PLAY would resume where I had stopped it. Seasons 2 and 3 seem to depend on Java, and hitting the STOP button returns me to the beginning of the disk, so I then have to work my way through the FBI warnings, the previews, and then work my way back to the part of the episode I had been watching. It's a shame CBS decided to make this change to seasons 2 and 3 because the first season was 100% functional, and the addition of the Java was unnecessary.

The actual video is great. If it wasn't for the documentation and Java issues I would be giving it a 5. Because of those issues, I am giving it a 4.

One other comment: the episodes are 51 minutes long. That means back then there were only 9 minutes of commercials in an hour. O the good old days!",1345680000,12,1889,4.262569832402234
307589,3,6300988600,"I think some of the reviewers here are reviewing the wrong product. This is a review of the pictured box set of DVD's, standard definition, no new CGI effects.

Obviously, TOS is the best TV show ever made, so my review doesn't concern the show itself, rather the box set release.

Many other people have mentioned the poor quality of the rather gimmiky packaging. It is flimsy and mine is already showing signs of damage even though I have been careful with it.
I also received one disk that was defective, a large portion of 'The Galileo Seven' was unreadable in both DVD players in my home.

The good new is this:
While performing a legitimate 'format shift' from the obsolete DVD format to .avi files to watch on my computer, I discovered two things.

Firstly, I set my ripping software to keep retrying when encountering an error, and managed to successfully rip and finally watch 'The Galileo Seven'.

Secondly, the entire three seasons, when converted to .avi take up about 28gb, which means that I was able to fit it all onto my tiny 32gb flash drive.

Now I have every episode of TOS ever made on my keychain, which is about as awesome as it gets!

An added bonus is that I no longer have to sit through the painfully slow menus and non-skippable parts on the DVD's.

This is entirely legal as long as you only make a copy for yourself for the purpose of format shifting, much like ripping a cd to listen to it on your ipod.",1343952000,7,1433,4.442748091603053

For me, it was like seeing it for the first time. I absolutely commend those who did the transfer, painstakingly upgrading the quality of the entire series. Their work shows. So far, this is the best transfer from a previous format to Bluray that I have seen. The fact they have the new effects and the originals is necessary for us to see the difference and for die hards who (foolishly) want to live in the past. Once starting to view the newly done transfers, there was no need to go back.

I found some of the new effects a little over the top, some looking a bit unreal. But there were few times that happened. Almost every extra relating to the series is in the collection, or so it seemed to me. The quality of the episodes is superb. Throughout, I continued to think about the work of those who did the transfer, since it was obvious on all fronts that it was more than a job to them. They clearly felt a duty to get it right.

307637,3,6300988600,"The initial interest in Star Trek might have been to imagine what life on other planets look like. The show didn't really provide that vision, but provided original entertainment at the time it was released, and remained original for decades thereafter. Today the choice of TV shows is far greater, although the quality has deteriorated. Star Trek is still unique, and worth watching for that reason. Some episodes are enthralling, whilst others are a bit monotonous.

I was an avid viewer decades ago. I delayed buying the DVDs. Then I saw rebroadcasts of the show on TV. Just as well I didn't buy it. In every episodes captain Kirk and his party gets into trouble on a new planet. After a while you would think that they would be more careful. Sending the captain of a ship into dangerous situations instead of an advance party doesn't really make sense, but obviously necessary to create main characters. In many episodes they get into physical combat, and gets beamed up just in time.

I did prefer the original series of Star Trek because the special effects were simpler, and it was more about the story. The acting didn't always look that serious. In later decades, the special effects became more elaborate, and it looked more serious. It wasn't as much fun, although the movies were entertaining.",1334707200,,1305,4.821428571428571

307640,4,6300988600,"Disclaimer (or claimer, as the case may be): I am a SERIOUS trekkie.

I have to say, having sampled just a few first-season episodes of the remastered series ... I'm iffy on this. The space effects look cartoony and cheap, though still prettier than the original series. That said, the clarity of the set pieces itself is very nice, a bit better than the first issue of the three-season boxed set, which I purchased a few years back. I'm not sure this is really much of an improvement over the first package set of all three seasons. It depends on your tolerance for very obvious CGI. If you can overlook the cartoonish effects of the space shots, you will probably appreciate the good quality of the actual set pieces showing the actors. I would say, if you don't have all three seasons on DVD yet and are comfortable with CGI touchups, go with this set. If you're NOT comfortable with CGI touchups, you'll be very happy with the non-remastered three-series set. I considered getting rid of the old set if I really liked this remastered set. Having sampled it, I plan to keep the old set.

Edit to add: Working my way through the second season and I'm generally pleased with (or inured to?) the CGI. A couple of episodes have CGI that actually slightly enhances the experience (e.g., Amok Time and The Doomsday Machine - and thank the Great Bird, they did NOT screw up the ice cream cone. That would have been a mortal sin - the ice cream cone is iconic. They just touched it up some). I still plan to keep my unremastered set, though, so my first observation still stands.

Note: Stupid, stupid, STUPID to put the episode guide on several separate cards rather than one card or a booklet.

307674,4,6300988600,"My review is a bit delayed, as I purchased this set last summer. It took me over six months to go through all 20 BD disks, and I finally finished watching in early December.

I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (my first episode was the 1967 summer rerun of ""Balance of Terror"" on NBC). Yet I have never owned the complete series in any of its formats (VHS or DVD). As the complete series DVDs disappeared and became impossible to obtain (except for the disappointing remastered DVDs--more on that below), I thought I would never be able to own this classic series in its original, unaltered incarnation.

Thankfully, Paramount/CBS has released an absolutely superlative BluRay collection of all 79 original episodes and some surprising and unexpected extras.

The extra I was most anticipating is to be found on disk 6 of Season 3: the original unaired (and very rarely seen) version of Star Trek's second pilot episode, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before."" This alone is nearly worth the price of the entire set. CBS was contacted by a German film collector who had the entire pilot in its original form on 35mm film. When CBS realized what he had, they agreed to pay for a complete HD scan, clean-up and re-color-timing of the whole film, which looks amazing, despite some occasional film damage. It's enjoyable to see the more serious tone generated by different theme music and ""Quinn-Martin""-style act breaks, as well as more fight scene footage in the episode's climax.

Of course, that's not all Paramount/CBS did in preparing this set. They went back to the original negatives, did a complete clean-up and new color timing of every episode. Each episode is now a visual revelation and practically every frame is sparkling with color and life. This remaster has renewed my respect for the producers and craftsmen involved with this ground-breaking show. Not only does the higher resolution not reveal as many flaws as I suspected it might, it actually makes the sets and costumes used back then look even more impressive than I remember them. There are some early episodes where makeup and costume inconsistencies are more jarring in HD than before (like some zippers showing near the uniform collars, and the seams in Leonard Nimoy's Vulcan ear appliances), but you can see that their execution of their craft got better and better with each subsequent episode. The HD remaster looks so good that you'll soon forget that your first viewing of this incredible series was likely on a fuzzy black-and-white TV with ghosting on the signal reception.

It won't be that much of a clich after you get your first viewing of these on BD, but here it is: it's like watching these episodes for the very first time.

There is some visible softness in transitions created on an optical printer, such as dissolves, fade-ins and fade-outs, but that is really fairly unobtrusive as you are watching each episode. However, because of the way the original effects were created, using multiple film elements combined on an optical printer, there was a lot of dust, scratches and damage they could not fix in the new scans on the effects and composite footage (such as Enterprise fly-bys and viewscreen inserts). This was a motivating factor in CBS' decision to have all new digital effects created beginning in 2006 for the newly-remastered original series.

Herein lies my only problem with the Original Series BluRay, and seeing as how I can view all of the original visual effects for every episode on this BluRay set (by either selecting the option from the main menu or by using the ""Angle"" button), it's not really that much of an irritant.

I really wanted to believe that the people who executed the remastered effects had Star Trek's best interests at heart, but after viewing them, I am so far from being sold on them that I will never accept them or watch them as an integrated part of each episode.

For one thing, they got certain details of the Enterprise wrong. I checked with some A/B comparisons of certain shots on the BluRay, as well as photos of the original model as it was being restored at the Smithsonian. That's pretty unforgivable, considering the producers could have accessed exactly the same material I did.

The remastered effects, more often than not, look overdone and cartoony, creating a feel not even close to the original filmed episodes. They would have been better served to recreate the same camera angles and lighting of the original Enterprise shots instead of making the camera, and the ship, swoop and dive like a spacecraft in modern visual effects. The remastered effects would have been at home on ""Enterprise,"" but not on the original series.

That said, there were some interesting additions that actually were successful, such as the new archaeological dig establishing shots added to ""The Man Trap,"" and the marvelously lifelike and active mattes of Starbase 11 created for ""The Menagerie"" and ""Court Martial,"" as well as the improved yet faithful cityscape of Eminiar 7 from ""A Taste of Armageddon.""

I'm really glad that, unlike Star Wars, we can still view the original versions on BluRay, and are not forced to accept the remasters as the new (and only) standard.

The 7.1 DTS-MA audio mix created for the remastered episodes is pretty amazing, even the newly-recorded, and thoroughly bombastic, main title theme. Despite the fact it doesn't quite match the action when accompanying the original visual effects, it's still very impressive, and a lot of fun to listen to. Even the original mono tracks included on the disks sound close to pristine (with a few bits of damage they were never able--or willing--to repair). My only possible gripe is that they should have also included the 5.1 mix they created for the original DVD release as an option, in addition to the original mono audio (and the Spanish and French dubs), but alas, there is only so much room for options on each BluRay disk.

If you are a Star Trek fan who really feels most at home with the original series, this BluRay set will satisfy you for years to come, and since Star Trek just passed its 45th anniversary, what a fitting way to renew your acquaintance with this incredible, ground-breaking, well-written and well-produced TV sci-fi gem. It easily is the equal to the other two classic sci-fi shows of the 60s, The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. Even at its price at this writing of $183, this is, frankly, an amazing bargain.",1325462400,46,6441,4.848953594176524
307675,5,6300988600,"If you already own TOS on DVD, then I would be torn on whether to recommend this.  But if you don't own TOS, or you only own VHS I would highly recommend this purchase.  The much talked about special effects enhancements are not as exciting as you might think.  For the most part they are mostly just shots of the Enterprise from space, and view screen shots.  Still since the original effects are included as angle 2, you can easily compare the old v.s. the new.  What you'll discover is the old effects just did not scale well to high resolution, so if you are consistently watching angle 2, they will actually distract from the episode.  If you are watching the new special effects on angle 1, they just blend in well so you won't really notice them after the first couple of episodes.

Consequently, at DVD resolution it probably would not matter.  But if you are watching 1080p on a large screen TV the blu-ray with the enhanced effects is exactly what you want.  Chances are if you are reading this review your are huge Star Trek fan.

307678,4,6300988600,"What a blessing that Gary Hutzel investigated the original ""Trouble with Tribbles"" stock negative to evaluate whether it could be used for this particular DEEP SPACE NINE time travel Tribbles episode several years ago. Remastered from the original negatives we have been able to re-experience the original series with a clarity and richness in textures and detail first on DVD, in HD and with Blu-ray the experience is equally breathtaking, one has the overall impression that the scenes with Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and colleagues were not shot forty years ago but just the day before yesterday.

However, just as with other classic titles remastered in HD, the ultimate high definition experience is limited to ""straight to camera"" material. Combined with other film material (e.g. footage of USS Enterprise model + footage of starfield background, bridge main console + viewscreen) the subsequent result of the two is a copy that inevitably lacks the detail of each original. And seemingly the original SPFX footage elements (USS Enterprise in front of a bluescreen)- unlike the original ILM SPFX footage of ST-TNG we will be able to see in January 2012 with this market demand Blu-ray test disc sampler - were no longer available.
Thus, the original STAR TREK SPFX scenes are rather soft and seem out-of-focus compared to the scenes shot straight on stage or on location. One can only hope that the original, separate SPFX elements can still be located and properly restored.

Why? Because frankly, I didn't find most CGI shots made for TOS to be that convincing either in HD, especially stern views of the USS Enterprise: The strange surface gloss and illumination of Kirk's starship in a variety of shots clearly reveals it (and other vessels) to be CGI, the same applies for the Galileo shuttlecraft (the CGI version now takes off like an X-wing-fighter in special-edition-style, which makes you wonder why they need a space consuming runway and hangar deck in the first place).
If the original SPFX shots seem too static and boring in retrospect, the new CGI shots are often erratic and hectic and definitely more DS9 than in sync with the original context and series. I think the director's edition of the first motion picture is a better example how to 'upgrade' classic material for new audiences.

Some of the digitally added new elements are definitely great (like the moving starfield behind Kirk and Lenore Karidian in ""The Conscience of the King"", new matte paintings enhancing the previously 'limited' surroundings), but some are rather unnecessary and distracting. I hope this is not the last and final 'word' on the original series.",1322956800,8,2655,5.0709382151029745

And I'm glad I waited and didn't get stuck with 79 separate VHS's in clamshells! You'd think I'd be a purist and all a-gripin' about the Remastering, but nope. I love it! Here's what the naysayers are missing in their reviews.

Of course Star Trek would be easy to preserve and clean up, it always looked great, it was a vibrant, colorful show. But no one probably thought that it would get ""tampered with""  la Star Wars. Fans hate to point out weaknesses in the things we revere, but face it, the stock shots of the same Enterprise model crudely super-imposed over the same planet footage, it was just jarring transition-wise.

The old-fashioned dials are turned into more futuristic read-outs, the Gorn blinks, the matte paintings are re-done more realistically, the phaser beams colors are in sync. The special features tell you that they basically used the same planet shot multiple times, just tinted it different colors. Let's face it, the budget went into Janice Rand's basket-weave hairdo, there wasn't much left over for FX.

But the new exteriors and bridge viewscreen shots aren't jarring like you might expect, in fact they flow with the original series footage better than ever. The ships don't jerk, they don't get translucent, but somehow they made the CGI a bit aged to fit in with the rest of the film stock. It's only when you first start watching that you anticipate the CGI and are more concious of it, after awhile you forget about it at all. There's a great side-by-side comparison at the ""Star Trek"" website, just search for ""Star Trek comparison remastered"". So basically, that's how I feel about THAT! Nyah!

Okay, the dvd packaging? Feh! It's SO bad that I find it funny now, every time I open the cases wondering how anyone could've seriously thought this was aesthetically-pleasing or convenient presentation. Unmarked dvd discs, a big 10-disc plastic case in a paper box in a plastic hinged box and the square cards with each episode listed on them. My cards fell out today when I tilted the box to pull the unweildy 10-cd plastic case out. Ugh. Anyway, so bad it's funny, at least I get a little laugh out of it!

My only possible complaint would be the lack of extra - documentaries etc... But; I won't hold it against the set, because there is simply so much information out there about the show that those types of extras are easily acquired elsewhere. Personally, I know the show inside out, so my main concern was simply the upgraded picture and sound, and not the extra features.

This gets 5 stars out of 5, because the Hi-Def remaster is really great. The picture is very sharp (there is alot of soft focus in the series that has nothing to do with the remastering) and the colours are really excellent. Its a treat to watch. The visual fx have also been remastered, in fact, they have been re-done! Where a planet used to be just a fuzzy glow, now there is an actual planet there. Backdrops and backgrounds have also been enhanced - now alien planets definitely look alot more like an alien world. The Enterprise itself has also been redone. While I always bemoan the death of models in favour of CGI, here they did a terrific job of replacing that old model with a nice fluid CGI version of the Starship. As its only used for the pass-by cutaways,i find this new enhancement to be a great success.
Please note that all episodes may be viewed with the original 1966 special effects, or with the new enhanced CGI inserts.
The sound for this set is also really quite amazing. Its offerend in 7.1 HD DTS. My system is merely a 5.1, but man, the sound really sucks you in. When the ship passes by, I get the ""whoosh"" sound track from speaker to speaker in the same direction as the ship. Also, the atmospheric sound effects when inside the Enterprise are fully econmpassing. You have to hear it to believe it!

In summray: One of the best TV series of all time. A fantastic Blu-Ray remaster with great picture and some of the best sound you will ever experience.

As part of ordering I wasn't able to escalate shipping to UPS or FEDEX from the USPS, so I send an email to 283mediacity on 7/25/11 requesting escalated shipping at an additional cost to me so I could receive this item by 8/11/11 my son's birthday.  283mediacity never responded to my email and on 7/25/11 they mailed out my order using the USPS with a delivery date of 7/29/11 to 8/15/11.  I sent them a second email to 283mediacity on 8/2/11 informing them that the tracking status for my DVD's was unknown and I also stated that I was not happy about them never responding to my earlier email on 7/25/11.  Once again no reply from 283mediacity at all.  As of today (8/16/11) no DVD's or email's from 283mediacity at all!!  Based on this I contacted Amazon customer support and an Amazon.com A-to-z Guarantee Claim has been filed to attempt to credit my MasterCard for this order.  The tracking information for this order is the same today as it was on 7/25/11 which is ""no tracking information available for this order"".  I would recommend that no one ever order anything from seller 283mediacity as they have proven to me to be VERY UNRELIABLE and VERY DISCOURTUOUS to their customers.  Buyer beware don't buy from 283mediacity unless you enjoy no service and many purchasing problems.",1313452800,13,1630,5.33203125

The outer packaging stated the captioning was in english and spanish. I liked seeing this because even though I'm not hearing impaired, I still use captioning to help follow what is being said. However, when I opened up the first season box and put in the first disc, I found out the captioning is in spanish and french, and does not have english captioning.
  It's a shame, CBS Paramount put in a great amount of effort to recreate this remastered set, only to miss the bullseye by not having on the disc what they print on the package.",1313280000,3,708,4.438461538461539

I do agree with others' reviews in regards to sound.  It does seem like the dialog is overpowered by sound effects.  I don't know if this was by design, but when I go through my tv speakers there are episodes where I can't hear the dialog even with the volume all the way up.  It sounds much better on my 6 speaker system.  They did however give the option for the original mono track.  I haven't listened to this so I don't know how it sounds.  There have been complaints about the price.  When I purchased the 2004 dvd season sets, I paid $100 per season.  This set is far superior and costs a lot less.  If you are a purist you can turn all of the new special effects off.  I however love the new effects.  This is the definitive Star Trek collection and I don't see how it could possibly improve.

Its another depressing indication of how dumbed down things are today. Grown-ups should definitely leave them on the shelf. Granted, the technical quality of the remastered sixties footage is amazing - shame they couldn't leave the pointless, intrusive, horrible CGI rubbish off it.

Second, on the discs I have seen, you have the option of viewing the original effects or the CGI effects. Therefore, it doesn't matter which you prefer, you can see the version you like.

Third, the MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE of the Blu-ray version is that you will see, for the first time in your life, the series as Gene Roddenberry intended you to see it. The original series was shot on FILM. Yes, actual film like they used to use for movies when computers were room-sized. Blu-ray is the only format capable of displaying the full definition of the film stock (as geeky as many of us are, I'm sure someone will argue this, but when you can see film grain, that's enough definition). If you have seen the series only on television or DVD, you have never seen the original series as it was intended to be seen. Do yourself a favor, try the Blu-ray -- you can rent them from Blockbuster online even though Netflix doesn't have them for some reason >:-|  or borrow them from your friend who has the giant media room in the basement.

307724,5,6300988600,"As I am writing this, Amazon is ""reviewing"" this product and no longer offering it due to complaints about the blu ray sets of Strar Trek the original series - Seasons 1-3. I have this set and can tell you there is nothing wrong with it. There was no problem with the packaging, the picture or the audio on this set. The problem seems to be with peoples inability to know how to use the features of their blu ray players or thier audio equipment. There ARE options for the sound. If you don't have the right equipment you can always change the sound output to the original mono instead of the 7.1 DTS HD audio option. I have my blu ray hooked up to a two speaker system and when I have the audio of the blu ray player set to 7.1 DTS HD (this feature can be changed no matter if you are watching the original or enhanced version) I do notice that the sound seems lower. This is because my stereo is not set up for 7.1 DTS HD sound. I simply set the audio of my blu ray to the 2.0 mono and I can hear everything fine. It's not rocket science, people. As for all the other complaints...I think people are just being way too petty. I think the blu ray technology is a little too advanced for some of you. Hooking your blu ray player up to a non HD tv isn't going to improve the picture much. The same goes with the audio.
  I waited a long time to own every Star Trek episode. I'm glad I didn't go with VHS or DVD because these Blu-ray discs are superior in every way. I hope Amazon will continue to offer this set to the rest of you. If they do, don't hesitate to buy it. Like I said, there's nothing wrong with these sets.",1304380800,26,1620,4.059375
307725,5,6300988600,"I am very pleased with Amazon's service and the Star Trek: TOS Seasons 1-3 Blu ray version.  After reading extensively about all the reviews and trying to decide which format to purchase (either enhanced or enhanced blu ray), I eventually decided the blu ray version was probably the best and the most current format to own at the present time.  I am quite pleased with the purchase and the show looks better than ever.  The colors, shadows and hughs are vivid and the special effects that were redone were handled extremely well and with great care.  The new effects are very respectful of the original effects. I consider myself a true fan of the original Star Trek series -one who is part of the ""silent majority"" of Star Trek fans that has never attended a Star Trek convention nor gotten overly bogged down in the show's trivia and gadgetry.  What matters most is the show's underlying themes and message and the wonderful acting and interplay between characters and the show's great stories.  Although some have argued that the enhanced effects are a detraction from the original series, I find the enhancements to be both exhilirating and wonderful and they have re-awakened my long term interest in the original series.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the show again with my children who are just discovering Star Trek for the first time and are fast becoming devoted fans. Although one of the boxed set (one out of three) was received slightly damaged during shipping, Amazon's return process was straight-forward and a replacement set was received within a day or two at no extra cost. If you are a sincere fan of the original series, the enhaced version will re-awaken your interest and pleasure in the show.",1304294400,4,1723,4.840136054421769

I'd also have preferred to see the episodes arranged in production order rather than by air date. I've had no trouble with the packaging thusfar, but I do not anticipate the cases holding up that well over the years.

307761,5,6300988600,"I reviewed individual episodes of The Original Series episodes during the initial DVD release which began in 1999. So, the comments here focus on the remastered blu-ray edition.

It goes without saying that the picture has never looked better. Colors pop off the screen, scratches have been removed, and grain, while noticeable, has been reduced to a bare minimum. Seeing the new remastering alters one's perceptions of the series. I had never noticed the tear streaming down the crippled Captain Pike's cheek as Spock reveals his plan in ""The Menagerie."" Unfortunately, with the improved picture, flaws in the original production are also more noticeable: shadows from boom microphones are detectable, zippers can be clearly seen in many of the uniforms, and a certain hairpiece has never been more obvious. Still, the picture shows the obvious care taken with the lighting and composition - very different from today's flatly-lit, smash & grab style of television filming.

Of course, the primary focus of this new release is the new CGI visual effects. Trek had a number of effects heavy episodes, including ""The Doomsday Machine"" and ""The Tholian Web,"" and they benefit the most from the new effects. Most of the new space shots are very convincing, remaining in the original spirit of the series. Only a few of the shots are major deviations from the originals, such as when the shuttle is seen exiting the Enterprise from the outside. Restraint seems to be the watchword here, and I would have liked to have seen a little bit more done, such as the replacement of some very dated view screen graphics in ""The Changeling,"" and correction to faulty composite shots, such as in ""This Side of Paradise.""  But the enhanced background plate in ""By Any Other Name"" is simply stunning, and the expanded castle front seen in ""Catspaw"" (an otherwise weak episode) is subtly done.  Toggling between the CGI and original effects, I was struck by how much the old effects distracted me from the story - more so than when there was no CGI option.  I've already been spoiled.  The new sound mix complements the improved picture, without calling attention to itself.  Compare with the mono original, also included, for a demonstration of the importance of sound design.

With the exception of The Cage and expanded version of Where No Man has Gone Before, the episodes include audio tracks in Spanish and French, although much of the Spanish dialogue is not faithful to the English originals. As for bonus features, most are carried over from the 2004 reissue, but the real highlight is Billy Blackburn's behind the scenes movies, which show the actors in costume but out of character - a real treat.",1297987200,6,2690,4.9490022172949

307764,5,6300988600,"...not being on the Blu-ray band wagon yet, I was still, wanting the release of the remastered original Trek series episodes. I'd seen a handful of them on broadcast after knowing the effort
was being undertaken and had highly anticipated the episodes. And knowing the Okudas (Mike and Denise) had oversight of the effort, I knew it would be done correctly and tastefully. The
project didn't disappoint- not all effects sequences were tackled- for instance, the transporter ""shimmer"". It was left as it- being a trademark of the original series. But ""stock"" shots such as
going into orbit, or orbiting a planet, the opening title flybys were all redone using fine CGI redos of the infamous ship and all planet spheres now appear realistic. The real sell for me was seeing The
gorgeous redos of all the space points of view shots in the episode ""The Doomsday Machine"". When Matt Decker backs a shuttle out the opening hangar doors of the Enterprise, it's a real kick- plus the opening shots of debris from the remains of planets bouncing off the disabled starship- just beautifully handled. The doomsday machine itself now is impressive and convincing as something quite huge.
That the films of each episode have been reprocessed to remove all imperfections (scratches, filth) and the look of the cast, most set shots given a subtle soft feel, all viewscreen shots redone......just awesome. There's a shot toward the beginning of ""Mantrap""- the first aired episode ever, after a commercial break point that's a pan around the area surrounding the Crater's ""home"" that's very nice and gives a truly deserted, uninviting feel to the planet they are there to explore.

Most of the bright, indoor scenes are crisp and clear as you would expect on Blu-ray. On the other hand, some of the darker special effects shots look like you're viewing them through a screen door. The lights and stars are not steady, but tend to flicker. This problem does not exist on every episode with every special effects shot, but it should not exist at all. I've noticed this on some other Blu-rays I've purchased in the past so it's not uncommon. Whatever the cause, I suspect it has something to do with the manufacturer going for quantity over quality. If you have a standard DVD set with the enhanced special effects, don't bother with Blu-ray. There's very little to be gained for the cost.",1293494400,9,854,4.662251655629139

Trekkers often tell each other, ""Getting MUGGED is our BUSINESS!""
That's the way it feels most times, because we, like the Star Wars fans are the most loyal and die-hard on the planet. They'll put out a series. We buy it. They find fifteen seconds of backstage footage, and throw it in, then put it out, we buy it. They compile series into Fan Packs (which I thought were great samplers for people new to Trek), we buy it.
Then TOS HD.
Now, TOS Blu-Ray.
For a series that was cancelled due to ratings, this franchise has made Paramount billions.
As a lifelong Trekker who owns every DVD of every series and the Fan Collections so I don't have to root through the seasons, all I can tell you is . . .
Buy this one.
I bought The Doomsday Machine on iTunes, saw how beautifully it was done, and spent the money with no hesitation on the series set.
The space effects were incredible and, in my opinion, in no way took away from the feel of the original series.
Example, in Operation: Annihilate! The Enterprise deploys satellites around a planet to emit Ultra Violet light. in the original, we see the Enterprise go around the planet and then they talk about them.
In the remastered, we see the Enterprise orbit, the ships bay doors open, the satellites come out and open their massive emitters.
A small thing, but so sharp to see.
The Enterprise was no longer a really big model that could only go frontward in a straight line. She was alive now, with moving parts, and could list when going into evasive maneuvers.
Her ""prop"" days were over and she had functionality.

There are a lot of special features. One of the most memorable for me was on Season one where you were in a shuttlecraft and could navigate around the CGI'd Enterprise and get an audio tour of the ship, her parts, and what their function was from the warp nacelles to the ion pod. Another great one was an interview with Black, one of the original writers of the series talking about Ellison, Block, and how they were politely turned down by Ray Bradbury.

I have seen a review complaining that there is no MENU and you had to fast forward through episodes to get to the one you want. May be an old version. There is a menu with EPISODES, ADDITIONAL DATA (Special Features and the ORIGINAL previews for the episodes on that disk) and STARFLEET COMMAND, I believe. That, I haven't used, but I believe it puts interview on small screen while you look at the show like a commentary. To choose your episode, you click on EPISODE and on the right will appear the name of the first episode. Under that is a right arrow, go down to that to forward past that episode and go on to another. And under them all you have the option of watching the NEW version or the OLD untouched version of that episode. There is also a feature where you can compare both special effects-wise as they play.

MY ADVICE:
I have a Sony LCD, and it looked fantastic. It looked even more eye-popping when I changed the PICTURE MODE to WIDE ZOOM (if you have an HDTV you will get the black bars on either side because of the film used) and playing with display setting, I found that VIVID (or DYNAMIC on Samsung and other TVs) made the colors of the series just as brilliant as the new effects and made them mesh even more.

Also, I checked out this Three Pack, and like I did with Voyager, STNG, DS9 and Enterprise, it's cheaper if you order the three separately.
A few bucks, but with times such as they are . . .
No, my fellow Trekkers, just wait. Some kid at Paramount will come up with the idea of putting the remastered ""Space Seed"" in front of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as one big epic, and they'll put that out too.
I think that one will be a pass.

The DVD's are not well protected. No disc lables on them just the center ring telling you the season and disc #. This was a way for Paramount to have a cheap product and charge a hefty price. Some of the new effects are ok but will never beat the originals that I grew up with. Also CBS DVD must not believe in a play all feature. This is the second TV series by this company that I bought and you have to pick one episode at a time instead of watching the entire disc. In season 2 I don't understand why they put 1, 2, 3, or 4 episodes to a disc to have an 8 disc set. That was so that they could fill the hard outer case up. I also don't like these flimsy Episode Guide cards. If you had the VHS complete set there is a diffrence in order. To me the VHS set is by Production # and it is more in the correct order than the DVD set that goes by the original air date. This is going to take some time to get used to. My opinion $188 plus is to much for this cheap manufatured set. I probably would have been happier with the 2004 set from other reviews I have read.",1279497600,9,1221,3.7734375
307819,3,6300988600,"I have to say that I largely agree with R. Roberts.  The labeling - when having multiple programs on one disk, in a series of disks - should have been a lot more informative.  And, Paramount should have just improved the picture quality (with digital remastering, etc.) - not completely redone all of the special effects.  While the external views of objects in space(ships, etc.) may look sharper/better-defined and more realistic, unfortunately, their appearance is incongruent with the (lesser) quality of everything else - which was largely retained in original form - not to mention, some obvious object motion creations that were poorly done and that clearly defy the laws of physics.  For instance, there was at least one re-done scene where the Enterprise was now depicted externally as having almost flipped-over (bordering on the Titanic) from an attack, but the internal scene - kept in its original form - showed everyone standing on level ground (180 degrees).

What will Paramount do a few years from now, to ""remaster"" the series, again - or ""improve it"", in their point of view: redo the series and add more Iron Gym-like definition to McCoy's build?  Put Invisalign on Scotty?  Add hair to where Kirk's hair was thin?  Re-clothe the crew with uniforms from Star Trek: The Next Generation?  Replace Kirk's outmoded Judo-like fight sequences, with mixed-martial art moves? Voice-over all of the date references, so that the characters' typical references to the ""past"" - like to ""World War III"", instead go a few centuries beyond the 1990's (since we are now past those years, and WW III didn't happen)?",1278720000,4,1618,5.0299625468164795
307820,4,6300988600,I have the Remastered version of ST-TOS on standard DVD. I'm quite pleased with everything about it and haven't experienced any difficulties in viewing. I couldn't find any mention in the reviews I read regarding my one small question: Where are the star Trek Bloopers????  Not including those was the biggest oversight in releasing this supposedly definitive edition. I was hoping they would at least be an easter egg but Nooooo! Stupid Stupid Stupid!

307821,4,6300988600,"I gave 4 stars because Star Trek is the best and the idea of the new FX into the old footage is inspired. But the Blu Ray conversion on these episodes isn't that great. Neither are the new FX. They could have done so much with this production idea but all they did was generate new looking ships with no detail.

The ships have such little detail in fact that they look like prototypes or work in progress ships. These FX are far inferior to the old movie's because in the movie's the ships had detail. The new FX are better than the old TV show FX but it's obvious that these guys at paramount got lazy.

Star Trek is one of the most inventive of all time. Paramount pictures are just lazy money grubbers who want to keep re-packaging these old episodes with no added value. 5 stars for Star Trek. 2 stars for the Blu Rays.",1277078400,5,824,4.208860759493671
307822,4,6300988600,"I realize there are quite a few people out there who just can't stand the idea of the classical episodes being altered in any way. In the company's defense, they really had no choice but to change some things. Consumers have bigger tvs than ever and expect picture quality to be decent. Well, the picture quality of the ships in the original series was staticky and just plain awful. So, it wasn't the company thinking ""hmm, let's change things just because we can."" It was more ""We have to improve the picture quality or it will look like crap to modern viewers.""

Frankly, the remastering really improved some episodes because it gives the audience views of what's happening outside the ship, which 1960s creators were unable to do. So, you get to see battle scenes happening instead of just having to interpret it through dialogue and shaking cameras.

Other changes include making the planets look like actual planets. It's really beautiful the way they did it. And there are a couple very small alterations, like in the famous episode ""Arena"" when Kirk battles the man in the lizard suit--excuse me, the gorn--they made the gorn look a little more realistic by having him blink like 3 times. It's very cool.

I too was a little skeptical of the remastered version at first, but now I prefer it. The picture quality is just significantly better.

Now, in regard to packaging, these dvds are some of the most terribly packaged dvds I have encountered, and I buy from Comedy Central. It's really stupid. The packaging is inconsistent between seasons (particularly between the first, and the latter two) and in order to find the episode you want you have to go looking through very losable cards.

Also, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I know most people wouldn't really care about that, but I enjoy watching films with subtitles sometimes, and I thought for like 180 dollars I would at least get some english subtitles. It's not a deal breaker for me, but it's irritating.

Lastly, there are lots of extra features and stuff. No commentary or anything, unfortunately, but some cool interviews.

So, in conclusion, I would recommend buying it, but it does have some pretty obvious faults that could have been easily solved that I guess the company decided not to fix out of cheapness.",1276473600,4,2285,4.798982188295166

It is deja Vu watching a number of episodes that I have not seen for 30 odd years. Just disappointed that quality issues have not been addressed and resolved.

307825,4,6300988600,"I'm viewing the show chronologically, now midway through the second season. The image is impeccable, at least on a 46"" screen. The menus are very cool looking. You can choose original effects, or the enhanced version. The latter means CG space shots of the Enterprise orbiting around more convincing-looking planets, and we see more varied angles of the ship itself, sometimes really close up. Ship maneuvers are more dramatic, and better convey the intended action. Other enhancements may include upgraded establishment shots of landing parties' surroundings, fixing bad composite shots, and replacing VERY bad-looking or dated mechanics when close up. These changes were not made in a pretentious way. The original space scenes in hi-def look seedy. And the redoes remain respectful to the show's unique visual style. The disks also give options for pop up tidbits like writers' comments, and encyclopedic info on star systems, aliens, and technologies when they are mentioned. There are interviews and retrospects too.

I took away a star because it has audio issues. Currently, I'm reviewing this with the HDTV's original speakers (no amplification or surround sound). Even so, at times sound levels seem wrong: background music is too loud when accompanying dialogue, and overall volume varies. Selecting original mono helps some. Still, on rarer occasions, volume would drop, be out of sync, or mute entirely when following an enhanced scene. (Pause/Play fixed it.) Perhaps all these issues will disappear when the audio system is upgraded.

On Amazon, I though this was an incredible value.",1275264000,2,1597,5.3585657370517925

These old beloved classics can now be seen & heard in the best possible way.
Since I originally saw these episodes in fuzzy black and white many years ago, it's been an ongoing journey of increasing perfection for me.  From B&W broadcasts to colour VHS tape, to Laserdisc, to DVD, and now this, the best of all.

The crisp picture looks like it was shot last week, not 45 years ago. The visual detail is amazing - I can see the sewing flaws in the costumes, and the edges of Shatner's hairpiece.  Naturally, you can now see detail you were never meant to see.  The wooden props, plywood control panels etc. are more obvious than ever, but it just adds to the charm.  I found myself constantly looking in the background for new details - and found them.  It looks so much more real. Even the acting is enhanced.  The subtleties of expression on the actor's faces leap out at you in this version.

The new (and optional) special effects are well-chosen & impressive without being obtrusive.
The sound quality is top-notch - the redone score is beautiful, and completely faithful - and the extras are fun.

The Season 3 shelf-label (sticker on the top that binds the case) reads: ""The Best of Star Trek: The Original Series, Vol. 3"" which seemed to indicate that it did NOT contain the entire run of season 3 episodes. I decided against opening the set, and sent an email to customer service requesting information, and whether or not I could return an opened set if it were, in fact, the wrong thing. Instead, they entered a replacement order for me, shipped next-day air at their cost.

When the second set arrived, I opened it to find the same thing--the shelf-label saying ""best of"" on the season 3 case. I put in a call to customer service to discuss it, and they said it was alright to open one of the sets to check.

Turns out the whole of season 3 IS included, and the shelf-label is simply annoyingly misleading. So, I wanted to let everyone else know, in case anyone else notices it and balks as I did.

The transfer is so clear you can actually see the stitching on Kirk's uniform in some shots. I'm seeing things from the show I've never seen before and this is coming from a Trekkie who's watched all TOS episodes dozens of times. There's a shot in Shore Leave when Kirk's talking to Ruth (near Vazquez Rocks) and you can see insects buzzing around the actress' head. This is something I've never see ever before and pretty funny when you consider the planet in the episode isn't supposed to have even insect life.

The only down side is I wish more episodes had commentary or extra information. As it is only 1 episode per disk has such extras. The extras themselves are really well done and give info that even the most die-hard Trekkie will find new and fun. Also, these episodes are not edited in any way.

What I liked best about these new discs are the enhanced effects. The only thing that really disappointed me when watching the original episodes was how bad the special effects were. The new effects are great and give each episode a fresh new look and make the action seem more intense and realistic. The enterprise looks much more like an actual space ship than a model and the planets look fantastic. Even space looks better. You can view each episode with original effects or the new enhanced ones, and you can toggle between both by using the angle button on your remote. So in summary even if you own the original episodes on DVD, it is worth purchasing these new ones, not just because the video and sound quality are so much better, but because the new effects give the episodes a great new look and actualy make them better.",1268438400,4,1165,4.5
307868,4,6300988600,"Okay, to be fair I didn't see Star Trek the first time around since I was too young.  However I got hooked on reruns in the 70's.  I have been holding off purchasing and finally decided to just do it.  Having read most of the reviews I have to agree that the packaging is... interesting to say the least.  It personally doesn't upset me as much as some (I think it's kinda cool) but I do wish the discs were labled with larger writing/episodes.  The insert cards are fine, but you can't line them up with each disc since it is in a ""clear box"" package.  If I wasn't so taken with the outer package then the inner one would probably upset me more.

Now, as for the content - this is where I see the most disagreement. For the most part I feel they did a very good job of revitalizing the colors and music and I do feel that the effects they added would have been approved by Roddenberry... it's not over the top and done just because they could do it (aka Star Wars/Lucas).  I would have been happy with the unretouched version or this one - I bought this one because I could get all three seasons together, bonus material, and it was cheaper... I think it helps that I am second gen Star Trek so I don't feel betrayed by the upgrades.  The only thing I wish they had done has nothing to do with the special effects - it's the subtitles.  THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES - why?  I often have the subtitles on to keep the volume down or for friends/family that are hard of hearing... I can live with it, but it would be nice if they put on subtitles for future releases.

Very glad I finally bought this set.  It's been wonderful seeing the shows again - the concepts and stories are great (race, color, creed, gender, age - non issues in Roddenberry's future) and I enjoy introducing the show to the third and fourth gen!",1268092800,2,1819,4.23768115942029

Then you have to either shove you fingers into the box, which is only open from the top, to extract the DVD case which is just clear plastic DVD holders taped together-lame. Oh yeah, and if you turn the box sideways to get the DVDs out then its possible that the nice quality but unnessary shiney slippery plastic cards will fall out. On to the actually DVDs, they are blank on the top-huh and why? I would say that to cut corners they had all the DVDs made at Bubba's DVD Burning Barn but then why the nice quality plastic cards? These cards simply tell which episodes are on what disc, WHICH really should just be on top of the actual DVD like it usually is (there is a reason why most DVDs are made like that). And regarding the box you have to dig into to get the DVDs out. This could have just been done book style, cardboard front/back and attach the plastic holders inside so that you can just take it out of the outer plastic shell and just open it up.
ANYWAYS enough of that rant. I love the show and the new effects they added, like when the ship is moving in space. It all looks clean and I'm over the bad packaging.

307900,3,6300988600,"I really loved the collectors edition packaging that were originally made for the 40th anniversary remastering of Star Trek: The Original Series, but HD-DVD's totally obsolete now, so other than looking funky they're pretty well useless. That is of course unless you wanna buy them as collectibles for they will become quite rare in time, otherwise I suggest you buy the Blu-Ray editions. And moreover as seasons two and three are only available in standard edition DVD it's even more pointless an idea to purchase them, as the extensive interactive special features are only available on high definition formats such as Blu-Ray. Also if you live outside of America and don't happen to own a multiregion DVD player then you won't be able to watch them at all, as they're only available in the NTSE format. Well then to sum up I just feel it's a damn shame indeed that the Blu-Ray editions of The Original Series didn't reuse this truly cool design for the packaging because then they would've rather neatly fitted in with all of the other collectors edition series box sets that were issued some time ago now, oh well. I even don't mind the fact they are a bit clunkily designed like some other reviewers have said, because as a completist it would have been cool for them to sit alongside my other Star Trek series.

I also don't have much of a problem with the remastering of this series for the fact is that Paramount didn't give them a drastically overdone makeover like George Lucas did with Star Wars but were very respectful, careful and subtle with the whole process. And anyway The Original Series (as first aired in the 1960s) is already available on DVD with only a basic remastering of the sound and picture for transfer to DVD so honestly I don't know what some fans are complaining about because at least they're both available if you decide you don't like these updated versions, and I think that shows a certain respect for us loyal fans.",1265241600,3,1954,4.696793002915452

307904,5,6300988600,"Take a venerated Sci-Fi Classic and add new CGI effects. What do you get? Star Trek 2.0!

The Bluray edition of STTOS is simply top notch. Apart from the enhanced CGI effects, the audio has been given a multichannel channel treatment (making it enormously better, but don't be expecting audio that's anything like The Dark Knight or Lord of the Rings). The picture, already immaculate in previous releases for a 40 year old show, has been remastered and cleaned up to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine you're watching something from 1966.

The main menu, somewhat confusing, nevertheless contains a plethora of interesting options and facts. The most interesting of these is when an episode is played along with a video/audio commentary that utilizes picture-in-picture to demonstrate exactly how much effort has gone into the remastered series by showcasing new special effects and also the rationale for including some effects and not others (the producers exercised enormous restraint in not going crazy with massive CGI space battles, now made possible by new technology). The most impressive thing about these commentaries is the realization that everyone did their utmost to preserve the original vision of the directors and writers.

Now on to the CGI effects... the most obvious difference is that the Enterprise has been rendered in full CGI and replaced in all exterior shots. In addition, planets have been rendered in glorious detail (often designed from dialogue cues about the atmosphere, storms, etc. when Spock gives an analysis), and phaser fire has been cleaned up somewhat. Explosions have become more dramatic, and in some cases, extra actors have been digitally inserted into the frame to enhance a backdrop (similar to what Lucas did in the Star Wars Special Editions). The Enterprise viewscreen is also enhanced, with such seemingly minor details as showing the Enterprise nacelles when moving away from a planet. These touches really help us to spend less time commenting on the cheesy special effects and more time enjoying the immersion into the Star Trek universe. One of the best additions can be found in Season 2's Amok Time, when the first shot of Vulcan includes a panoramic version of the surface. It's an extraordinary establishing shot which lends atmosphere to the proceedings. Wondering what the big deal is? Use the ANGLE button on your remote control to switch seamlessly between old and new special effects, and you'll get your answer!

Thanks to these enhancements, the Bluray edition of Star Trek The Original Series provides an experience akin to watching an entirely new show. And yet, the cheese factor still exists in the form of the occasionally silly plots (Spock's Brain, anyone?) and. the. wonderfully. enigmatic. delivery. of.... William-Shatner! A must see and must buy for any Trek fan, even if you own previous releases. There is simply so much to love in this new box set.",1264550400,6,2940,5.106029106029106

307908,1,6300988600,"First, I ordered this set on Walmart, not Amazon after selling my remastered DVD set.

I was SO excited to receive it!  Boy what a mistake!

First thing I noticed was that I could hear some disks moving inside the cases before opening it up.  One of the disks in season 2 was scratched because of being lose during shipping.

Then I popped in the first disk of the first season and began to watch.  Yes it's 4:3, but that was fine and the video was outstanding.

The bad part was when the first episode started, I noticed I had to turn up the sound quite a bit to hear them speak (this did not happen with the preview of Star Trek the movie, which comes on first)!  When I paused and switched back to the TV, I almost jumped off the couch because I had the volume so high to hear the episode!  So I went back in to see the audio settings on the disk.  It was set to DTS, so I switched it back to 2 speaker mono, but it was doing the same thing.  I skipped over a few more episodes and found the same problem.

After doing some research, I found this problem was popping up quite often.  I also noticed that Amazon stopped selling the first season on Blu Ray!  Go read the feeback there as well.

It is very cool to switch back and fourth on the old and new version, but when you go back to the old version during the theme song, they still took out the old theme song, which sounds WAY better than the new one they made.  The new version of the theme song is SO BAD!  The womans singing is very off time.  I mean, its so bad that it's funny.  The old way was so much better...what a shame.  I wonder what the heck they were thinking after recording that woman's voice...wish I could have been there in the studio to say ""What the f#$% is that!"".

So besides the defect with the audio, one scratched disk, the episode order and the very lame remake of the theme song, this was a good attempt to have the ultimate set of Star Trek.

All they need to do is get the audio right, have the option to watch it in episode order and have the option to listen to the original theme song and this set will freakin' rock!

Right now, Paramount needs to re-release this, SOON!  I am missing my remastered set I sold right now ""sniff""...well, not really.  I hated the way the disks were designed in those sets.

The good part was Walmart took it back without any problem...don't know how Amazon is handling it, but maybe you should call them before you buy it or do more research.

Big SHAME on Paramount for not getting this right.  I checked their website, but they have nothing to say on it.

Hey, maybe Star Wars should do the same thing with episodes 4, 5 and 6!  It would be great to see and hear the old Star Wars movies in their original raw format and switch to the new remastered version (although I prefer the grainy old ones).

I grew up on the original Star Wars Trilogy, Tron, Terminator, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, the TOS movies, etc. Making it through just the core episodes like 'Space Seed' and 'Mirror Mirror' of TOS always felt like a chore, until now. I've been much more forgiving towards the TOS with the Blu-Ray edition.

Depending on when you purchase this the individual sets MAY be a better deal (as of 12/09 they are about $24 less)

This is for the Blu-ray three season set. Many folks are rating this based on THE PRICE (that's not what the star sysem is for folks--it's for the overall quality of the sets)my rating is based on the quality of the sets, their packaging and the original episodes themselves NOT THE PRICE.

In a nutshell: The show looks terrific and you can toggle between the original visual effects and the new ones with ease most of the time. The writing for the first two seasons was top notch with the third very much a hit-or-miss affair. The show looks stellar with new digitally prepared ""prints"" that have been cleaned up, color corrected and had damage repaired.

Extras are virtually identical to the last DVD set which also had the new visuals but we also get 3 new ""Trek"" extras (for all three seasons) Billy Blackburn's behind-the-scenes footage. This color footage was shot on location but without sound which gives us a unique look behind the production of the show. Ideally CBS/Paramount would have incorporated these into a new featurette with narration by Blackburn, Nimoy, Shatner and others discussing production for the various episodes but they are nice to have here with Blackburn's memories of working on the show.

Included is the original unaired alternate pilot for ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" which keeps the original visual effects intact as well as alterned music and the edit is slightly different compared to the aired version. ""The Cage"" is included with both the ""restored"" color version as well as the black and white version that has come with all the previous sets BUT it is NOT in HD (I suspect the source material may only be SD videotape) it does, however, feature Roddenberry's original introduction.

We also get two Comicon 2009 featurettes (one hosted by David Gerrold writer of ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""The Cloud Minders"" and an award winning novelist)as new featurettes on the third season set.

There are no additional discs or special features if you buy this boxed set of three vs. the individual titles.

For those who want to know the case for the third season is slightly thinner than the first two.

Bottom Line: Compare the price of the three seasons to the individual seasons before buying because there isn't anything else of value included here beyond what are on the individual sets.

CBS/Paramount has added a couple of special features here unique to each set but not every single special feature on the previous boxed sets appear here either (although most do). Buy whichever one you can get for the least price since there's nothing ""special"" about this bundling at this time.",1260576000,395,2796,4.830543933054393

They were very tasteful and kept the graphics down to earth, and very 60's looking.  Just nice to see the Enterprise in some more shots than just panning by the screen left to right like it used to be.  So for the remastered version, I give it 5 stars.

As for the packaging of these, I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking.  Very very lame packaging.  There is a cardboard insert in the big plastic box they come in.  Then in the cardboard insert, the DVD's are just in a plastic rack that opens like a flimsy book.  There is no attached labeling to know what DVD is what, but instead they send separate ""cards"" that have disk and episode information on them.  It's rather hard to explain the whole configuration, but I just think they could have done something better with the packaging, cause this is just flimsy and clumsy.

Overall, this is a very good set, and I would still recommend it to any Star Trek fan out there that isn't truly hardcore.....meaning if they want to see it exactly as it was in the 60's, then don't buy this set...buy the older set that is just like the originals.

As everybody knows, they changed all the special effects shots.  I'll repharase, they replaced cheap, cheesy 1960s special effects with cheap, cheesy 2000s special effects.  They look hollow and fake at best.  So if they weren't going to put in a real effort, why bother replacing them?  At least the models used in the original series looked like actual objects rather than drawings.  As for the rest of the restoration, the newly recorded theme bothers me to no end.  They used the original monologue from Bill Shatner, why not the music?  The rest of the music was remixed from their 3-track sources and sound great, no problems there.  As for the picture, the image is noticably cleaner than it used to be, but they messed with the color/contrast a great deal, added people in the background where they didn't used to be.  Really, why did they do this?  I guess I'm in the school of thought where you ust don't mess with the classics.  A lot of people say ""well if CG was available back then, they would have used it"".

307986,4,6300988600,"I grew up watching the original series on NBC, and while I am all in favour of nostalgia, I have to say I love the remastering and new digital effects on these DVDs.  Planet surfaces now have textures when seen from space, the colours are no longer washed out, and the images are sharper and crisper.  The argument can and has been made that this is the way Star Trek would have looked had Gene Roddenberry had the technology available to him back in 1966.  My biggest complaint in that the default subtitles on many of the episodes changes from None to Spanish for no apparent reason.  The first episode or two on each disk will not have any subtitles, then for no reason, the next one or two will have Spanish subtitles.  So you have to exit the episode, go back to the main menu, select ""None"" in the subtitles menu, and then go back to the episode.  Worse, there is no indication of when this is going to happen, and selecting ""None"" when you first load the disk has no effect on later episodes on the disk.  To me this is far more of a ""deal breaker"" than the new digital effects. Also, as others have noted, the first season disks have the now defunct HD-DVD episodes on the ""A"" side of the disk, while the other two seasons have them on the ""B"" side.  It's a petty gripe, but if you don't realise this, and try to play the first season without flipping the disks over first, the disks won't load and you might mistakenly believe you received faulty disks.",1249776000,5,1462,4.329670329670329

Each season comes in its own clear clunky plastic ""holder"" box and then the disks for the season are in a set of book-page like folders.  It would have been a whole lot easier to slip the disk boxes into simple paper or plastic sleeves and also would have taken up much less shelf space (about 1/3 less).

A real annoyance for me is that there are no labels on the individual disks other than the tiny lettering in the ring of the disk that says ""Season 1, disk 1"" etc.  It would have been much more helpful to have printed the season/disk on the individual DVD.  The problem wouldn't be so bad if it were easy to figure out which episodes were on each disk. The way the disks are packaged, there is a set of plastic cards (one for each disk) and a set for each box you need to rummage through trying to figure out what actually is on the disks.

The whole set could have been much more user- and eco-friendly if it had simply been packaged with a slip case and a well-labeled box for each season that (gasp!) listed the episodes for that season on the back of the box.  Better yet, geniuses who put this set together could probably have created a small booklet to put into the larger sleeve that would have listed episodes in order (perhaps with dates and a few lines of plot summary)and then added an appendix listing each episode by name and location on the set.  Even if the disks had NOT been better labeled, simple addition of a better printed guide instead of the dumb cards would have been much more helpful.

A PS:  I can't resist saying that I really don't like  being able only to see the ""added in"" and cleaned up special effects.  Part of the charm of the original Star Trek was the sometimes cheesy (but usually impressive given time and budget) effects.  I think most DVD players have the option of switching angles , so I wonder why it wouldn't have been possible to have an option of watching original or enhanced scenes.",1247961600,3,2212,4.2860576923076925

The video details on my old disks were much better, brighter, and made one feel like we were almost on the set with the actors.

This package deal, however, is not. First of all, Season One contains HD DVD on one side and regular DVD on the other, whereas the rest is only regular DVD ... leading to confusion as to why discs keep randomly not working.

Second, instead of putting the discs in sleeves that are marked with their contents or otherwise being easy to tell what's what, there are separate plastic (?) cards listing each disc's contents, apparently designed to scatter to the winds and make you guess. The individual discs are only marked in tiny letters around the inner rim. Why? Surely if you had the budget to make plastic cards, you had the budget to put decals on the discs.

Third, the packaging is like one of those Russian dolls that contains the whole family in one -- each disc is in a box, which is inside another box, that's inside a plastic case, that's wrapped in cellophane and then put into another package. It takes longer to unravel a disc than it does to watch an episode. 0.o

However! These annoyances with the presentation don't alter the fact that the original Star Trek is and always will be both awesome, and better than any of the followups. The only one that even comes close is the Animated Series, which sadly is not likely to get this detailed a brush-up. But it would be glorious.

308036,5,6300988600,"I was delighted when I heard about Star Trek being 'remastered' (I'm one of the few Star Wars fans who found the new effects added to those films to be well done).  Like Star Wars, I thought it could work if they stayed true to the original Star Trek shows as they were originally shot.  How glad I was to see that they did!

The new effects work wonders - the best part for me is that the actions in outer space now match the dialogue spoken by the actors.  'The Doomsday Machine' (my all-time fave) is an example of this.  We SEE the ships doing what the characters describe, not just routine stock shots of the same old Enterprise flybys.  Even middle-of-the-road episodes such as 'Gallieo Seven' benefit from these enhancements (the burn-up sequence is stunning).  Little things abound, such as the Pod seen missing from the Enterprise's aft section as she comes into orbit in 'Court Martial' (also here we get to see the Intrepid parked in a lower orbit, again mirroring the base commander's dialogue).

My only beef is the fact that while many infamous 'bloopers' are digitally fixed (adding phaser beams were none were before but SHOULD have been), major goofs are left unfixed.  These include a blank viewscreen seen behind the 'evil' Kirk and the captain's insignia missing from his uniform in early shots, both from 'The Enemy Within', Baylock's missing line from 'The Corbomite Maneuver' (surely a sound-alike could be found if not the original dialogue reel), and from 'Charlie X': Charlie's reflection in the medical monitor while he's supposed to be lying down, and the 'steel wall' cracking visably when Spock & Kirk are thrown against it by Charlie.  None of these (or other little things) makes viewing these remasters any less gratifying, but you'd think that if some things were going to be fixed, the rest should too.

So the bad.

1. The DVDs are packaged without labels. So it is virtually impossible to know what is on each disc without checking the index cards, which are packaged separately.

2. Confusing packaging: The DVDs have HD-DVD on side 1 and standard DVD on side 2 for Season 1. Season 2 and 3 have standard DVD only, on side 1.

3. Bad packaging: An extremely slim line packaging, with poor construction means it is very easy to damage your discs, place them in the wrong location, or RECEIVE THEM SCRATCHED.

4. Disrespectful packaging: All in all this is packaged as if it were a budget release, not one of the most profitable and beloved franchises of all time. For shame!

Since this is TOS, the greatness of the series outweighs these flaws, but I would strongly urge purchasers to TEST every disc within the limits allowed for warranties, so returns can be done within that time.

Option to avoid purchasing: CBS.com as of the date of this review has all of these available for free streaming viewing, though not all of them with remastered effects, and with annoying interstitial commercials strewn thereof. Nonetheless, for noncompletists, this may well be sufficient.

 One thing that made Star Trek ""cool"" was how they did so well whith their imgaination with such a small budget, its fun to see 1960's tv's with its model ships and such.  Now thats taken away, you have a 1960's looking show when we see the crew of inside the ship, then we have this 2007 computer generated star ship and alien ships when in that mode.

I can see having both TOS editions available, I cant believe Paramount has discontinued the original un-cut series on DVD...its like what New Coke did the the Classic Coke.
But Im sure it will be back in a year or so, ofcourse with new packaging, a few new featurettes and a new price, just another way to rehash the same stuff and sell more units.  It all about the dollar.

Aside from making more money for the company, what was the purpose? I thought the idea was as idiotic as Spielberg replacing guns with walkie-talkies in E.T.

However, I accidentally bought the remastered version of season 3 without knowing that I had. I watched through my new DVD copies of seasons 1 and 2, and then started s3 and my first thought was...""didn't the budget go down for the last season and not up? Why does everything  look so good?"" I only then double checked the box and realized that I'd somehow gotten my hands on the remastered release. And I must say, it's AMAZING.

308113,1,6300988600,"Whoever thought of this at CBS Video should be ashamed.

I love Star Trek.  I have watched every episode multiple times.  I recently began to watch the series with my kids and they love it too.  We rented episodes of the 2004 series on DVD.  These were great--5 stars. The original episodes, in their original format, with the original songs, the original visuals of the ship, everything.  Totally Awesome!

We were renting so much I decided to take the plunge and buy the series.  The 2004 wasn't available easily (you can find it on E-bay and used from Amazon), so I got the 2007 series.  I figured ""remastered"" meant better picture.  I could not be more disappointed.  Where to start....

Let's start with the simple--There are *NO* labels on the DVDs.

1.  Each DVD has no label on it whatsoever (unless you count the illegible 2 point font ring around the center).  Unlike the 2004 release (which had both the title of each episode and cool pictures on each DVD) these DVDs have nothing.  So, you are confronted with the problem of what episode on which disk.  Should I label them with a sharpie, etc... Better not because ...

Season 1 has the defunct HD DVD on one side (the one that plays when the tiny font ring is facing up) and regular DVD on the other.  The rest of the DVDs have the normal format on the side that plays when the font ring is facing up.  Confused?  Read on!

The DVD's are packaged in a clear hinged case that is like a stack.  You cannot tell which DVD is which, which episode is on which DVD.  You cannot separate the individual cases from the stack.  This is such exceedingly bad design (especially given that they did such a nice job in 2004) it is maddening.

There is no apparent way to label the DVDs either.  There is a set of translucent plastic ""playing cards"" at the back of each of the three stacks corresponding to each season.  These don't fit in the DVD case and you have to pull them out  each time to see what episode is on what DVD.  Arg!!

Now for the Heresy--these episodes have all been ALTERED!

2.  ***ALL*** scenes of the Enterprise (and other ships/stations and planets) have been removed and replaced with digitized versions of the ship, a la ""Star Trek TNG"". (the sole exception is the 2 second clip of the ship that appears in the trailer of each episode).  This is supposed to be a ""feature,"" and I suppose it is for folks who never actually saw the original series.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  They have removed every single shot of the ship and replaced it with digitized versions.

Gone are the cool hokey wobbly ship scenes from ""The Galileo Seven,"" and the paper mache cone from ""The Doomsday Machine"".  Replaced with digitized stuff.

It frankly beggars the imagination to understand folks who rejoice in this set!  Really, the original show was great, no need to redo it.  Even if one likes the new digitized ships, the poor packaging and lack of labels on the DVDs would limit this to at the most 3 stars.

Oh yes, the intro classic Star Trek theme has been redone.  Suppose that is the coup de gras to all the mangling.

Finally, they seem to have removed the English subtitles in this version (a real pain for watching via a DVD player on the plane or when you need to keep the sound down).  Yes, the 2004 version had very nice English subtitles.  There is closed captioning in the 2007 release, but that feature doesn't work on most DVD players, just TV sets.

My personal theory is that all the 5* reviews are execs or shills of CBS Video, its affiliates, or folks interested in pushing the release of the new JJ Abrams Star Trek movie.  Otherwise, it is baffling.

There are presently two boxed sets...the discontinued three-box set, and this present remastered three-boxed set. (Update: add the Blu-ray version to this list. Review was written prior to this edition coming out...)

I had a hard time of deciding which version to go with. The out of print version can still be purchased for around $160-$180 used, but contains no new effects or significant clean up. The remastered version, on the other hand, has each and every frame of the series retouched and remastered.

I finally decided on the remastered three boxed set and I am totally glad that I did. I've only seen STOS on reruns on television. The remastered DVD set has done a remarkable job in refinishing the overall look of the show by adding more contrast, color, and redone special effects which make revisiting Star Trek a novel and virtually brand new experience even for a long-time fan such as myself.

The packaging is pretty spartan with each season's DVDs encapsulated in a multi-DVD plastic case holder. This dvd carrier is then enclosed in a plastic outer case. The DVDs, unfortunately, do not display any of the cool artwork of the previous iteration of DVDs But if content outweighs your aesthetic needs, you'll do just fine.

The special effects team did a terrific job of doing just enough to make the Star Trek experience true to the original concepts while tweaking here and there to spruce up the look of ST.

I was blown away by the way each episode was remastered. The crispness and look of these new prints actually drew me deeper into these episodes although I have viewed them many times on television reruns. Watching them on a flatscreen HDTV brings new life into the show.

Although the remastered collection, is for all practical purposes, done in standard DVD format, (with the exception of the dual disc HD DVD first season), the detail and colors of the show are remarkable. The special features, some of which were presented in the discontinued boxed set, were fantastic. I have never seen these, so those of you who have maybe somewhat disappointed. In any event, there are several new features that all trekies can enjoy.

The biggest downside to this set is the price. In my opinion, it is way too expensive for what it offers. Even for a die-hard fan of the original series, the pill was just too expensive to swallow. I was fortunate enough to purchase this set new at a very deep discount, but the present $200-$220 price mark for this set is extraordinarily overpriced, in my opinion.

For those of you who want to see Star Trek in all its remastered glory, waiting a bit more until the set is more reasonably priced will offer a better value. For all others who cannot wait, it may be worth it if you buy it at a discounted rate or through the use of coupons.

And for those of you who cannot wait at all, this set still offers exceptional entertainment value. If you already purchased the previous three-boxed discontinued version, it may be a bitter pill to swallow by again buying this series.",1235692800,9,3197,4.664298401420959

I've been watching and waiting for the price to drop, and finally I was able to find it at a reasonable price. I'm absolutely thrilled to be watching this show again after so many pleasant childhood memories. The remastered editions with the added special effects make it even better. This show triggers many happy memories growing up, and I don't regret the purchase at all.

However, the packaging for this set leaves alot to be desired. Upon first glance, the sets look great. Then I picked it up and began opening it only to find tiny shards of plastic rattling around inside. Luckily this was only for the first season, 2 and 3 seem intact for the most part. The outer casing just seems way to brittle for the price we are paying. Inside the clam shell case, the discs are in individual thin plastic sleeves that are hinged together. This hinged device rests inside a cardboard holder. The discs themselves do not have episode titles on them, so you have to refer to these little cards that come with the set to find the episode you want to watch. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the packaging...I would have been satisfied if they'd packaged it in the thin pack boxes like most other t.v. shows do nowadays. These sets look great on the shelf, they just needed to be alot sturdier.

At the end of the day, I'm glad I bought this set, as it will most likely be the last time it's released on standard DVD format. I'm just not ready to spend the large amount of money it will take to upgrade my extensive DVD collection to Blu-Ray just yet. I'll wait 2-3 more years until the prices are more manageable. It's just a pleasure to revisit this show again, it's like an old friend you haven't seen in years.

I recommend this set for the show and the new special effects only, not for the packaging.",1234742400,3,1882,4.449275362318841

I had to number each disk and ceate a Word document that has the disk number and the Episode Titles.  I have never bought disks that did not have the names listed.

2.  Each of the 3 seasons comes in a plastic box with the Star Trek Emblem.  Inside each box is a paper box.  The outer plastic box is not needed and they can lower the price if they stop using this.

Why cant well enough be left alone? Why does everything have to be redone, to be made shiny and new?

Star Trek is a TV Classic. It was a child of it's time, cheezy special effects and all. It's as if the Borg Collective reached back into the Paramount offices, and took over, saying, ""You must upgrade... you must conform...We will assimalate you"".

Star Trek does not need to be assimilated, updated, remastered, or fooled with. Fans of the show love it for what it is, an OLD TV show and the warts be dammned. The TOS of Star Trek IS TV history.

So please, Paramount/CBS: Reissue this set, and allow new fans to see TOS as it originally aired. Don't be like the Borg, and bury a true slice of American TV history for the new and shiny.",1234569600,4,784,4.241610738255034

Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine then what effects(let alone HD picture quality) would be possible 40 years later, but now I know. I was frankly shocked at the improved picture quality when my local station broadcast these remastered shows recently in HD with the new SFX scenes included. It's probably what watching the original film print projected on a screen was like when they were first shot.
But as much as I loved TOS, I realized even then that some of the SFX were simply crude looking and not what they could be. This remastered set completes Gene Roddenberry's original vision of what the show could be, and I'm sure he would be pleased with the final result. I know I am.
I sincerely hope this set is eventually offered in BluRay so my ST TOS collection can finally be complete.",1233705600,,885,4.503105590062112
308164,3,6300988600,"OK, here is the deal (and it took a long time to figure it out.)

First, as far as the content: Fantastic, the remastering is superb and in some cases, thrilling. Brilliant work by extremely talented people who really understand what they're doing and gave great reverence and respect to the original material.

The problem is with the suits. No, not the costumes, the execs at Paramount.

It's a case of getting more than you paid for, a bonus of sorts, but renders the rest of the set unwatchable and, as Spock would put it, ""quite irritating.""

My set came with Season One a COMBO disc in HD-DVD format on one side, standard DVD on the other. This was a surprise, because I'd bought only a DVD set on Amazon and thought only a complete DVD set was available.

Alas, no. It seems that Paramount had mastered an HD-DVD version of ONLY THE FIRST SEASON until the format died. So here I was, excited and thrilled that somehow I'd gotten an HD-DVD version of the entire set! Being the idiot that I am, I assumed the entire set was comprised of combo discs. I watched the first season in unbelievable high definition, and couldn't wait to get to Seasons Two and Three.

Only... Seasons Two and Three weren't combo discs, but standard lo-res DVD!! I had to go to Amazon to deduce what had happened.

Apparently Paramount had packaged these with the combo discs thrown in as an unlisted bonus. Or they wisely realized that people might be pissed off that Seasons Two and Three weren't in high-def and just not buy the set, preferring to wait until the inevitable Blu-ray release.

Either way, the result is definite disappointment. There is NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER between the DVD versions and the high def HD-DVD and soon to be inevitably released Blu-ray versions.

I can't even watch Seasons Two and Three now without cringing. So much for surprise unlisted bonuses.

The conclusion is simple: Paramount should have released these in DVD only, and then in Blu-ray. Or never done a complete set at all until the Blu-ray version came out.

Mixing up the versions is a poison pill, probably designed to make sure people will buy the set twice, once in DVD (and check out and get hooked on the high def video with HD-DVD) and then again in Blu-ray.

In fact, with the demand these things have got to be generating, there's no reason there isn't already a Blu-ray version out, or at least an announcement certain release date.

My advice: Buy season One in HD-DVD if you really must see it now, and skip seasons two and three and definitely this complete set until they release the Blu-ray versions. I wish I'd figured it all out before I blew a lot of money on DVD versions I'll never watch. Of course I'm lucky enough to have an LG player that does both Blu-ray and HD-DVD.",1232928000,29,2769,4.569696969696969
308165,5,6300988600,"I am a huge fan of the original TV series and purchased this item to prepare for the movie coming out in 2009. My boyfriend had never seen the show and he was not familiar at all, so he needed some education! He loves it now, too. :)

The set itself is very beautiful. Each transparent/silver box houses one season of the series. The artwork on the outside (photos of key characters, the Enterprise, etc) are very high-quality. Inside the plastic box there is a cardboard sleeve. Inside the cardboard sleeve is a multi-disk booklet holding all of the episodes. There are plastic info cards for each disk, which are lovely, but I don't know what to do with them. They do not slide in anywhere that I can find, and there is no front cover to the booklet with the disks, so I can't just sandwich them in with their respective disk... So I don't know about those. The disks themselves are dual-sided (HD on one side, Standard on the other) and are identified on the center. Sufficient, but not beautiful.

The menus are great! Each disk opens in the transporter room, and key characters/events appear on the transporter. It's cool. :) You make your episode selection from the transporter control panel. Also cool. There is a special feature/video on each disk. I'm not that into special features, so those don't really mean much to me.

The quality of the episodes themselves are PHENOMENAL. Everything is GLORIOUS. The remastering of the special effects is done with perfection. There is no classic Star Trek charm lost at all, and the newly animated Enterprise fills my heart with joy. :) I am so pleased to see it sliding through space, orbiting planets, and shooting those phasers in three-dimensional glory. Fantastic. Don't think for a moment that ""remastered"" means ""unfamiliar"" or ""foreign"" or even ""surprising."" If the original creators could have done it this way, used this technology,... they would have. It's beautiful.

308166,4,6300988600,"I missed out on Star Trek when it first appeared on TV. I didn't have a TV at the time, nor did I want one. It wasn't till about the mid-70s (now with TV) that I became aware of Star Trek re-runs. I found them to be interesting and amusing. I'm a scientist and practically everything I knew about chemistry, physics, geology and biology had to be tossed out and replaced by psuedo-scientific jargon that sounded somewhat realistic and probable, but was, in fact, ludicrous. Yet, somehow, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and all the other wonderful cast members brought off a subtle space-age comedy that presented compelling viewing. I ended up taping about 20 episodes for a small library, but my project ultimately failed.

My interest in Star Trek faded until I met a young lady, now my wife, and we started watching the ""Next Generation."" First thing you know we finished ""Deep Space Nine"" and then ""Voyager."" What next? Well, why not go back to the ""Original Series?"" So, I bought her this Remastered Three Season Pack for a Christmas (2008) present and we're now a little over two thirds through viewing it.

The remastered Original Series has been spiffed up quite a bit relative to my memories of those old re-runs. I notice, in particular, that the colors are considerably brighter and bolder. Too bright and bold, in my opinion. Plus a lot of the colorations remind me of when my old Tube-type color TV set burned out one of the color elements and false colored images prevailed. I just don't care for this change. OK, the old color was rather bland and dull, but I'd just as soon view it that way. The sound has also been enhanced from place to place and I notice my sub-woofer come into play now and then. Also, a lot of the images of planets (particularly, class M) seem to be enhanced and modified. I suppose all these changes are meant to update and freshen the late 60s series, and the producers do a reasonably good job of it. Given the choice, however, I'd rather view the original series as it originally was. Oh well, it's fun to watch, in any case. But, if I had to do it over, I'd get the original unaltered versions.

308200,5,6300988600,"I've been watching Star Trek since I was a kid. The first episode I ever saw was the animated episode ""Beyond The Farthest Star"".

So my jaw dropped when I was at a friend's house one day (who had cable) and I first saw ""The Savage Curtain"". I was astonished... this was a LIVE action series too? I asked my friend.

The first VCR my family bought was at MY request... because I wanted to record and KEEP every episode.

The original unaltered episodes are on my home recorded DVD collection somewhere, collected off of the Sci-Fi network during the constant reruns of several years ago.

But...

I have always wanted my OWN copy of the unedited episodes... usually significant dialogue is clipped out to make room for commercials. With VCR tapes we just couldn't afford to buy 'em all.

But now we have DVDs, the Internet, and occasional deep discounts.

We also have brand new special effects, which are very creatively done and NOT overused. I completely agree with many of the other reviewers... as a long time Trek fan I was extremely skeptical but they MADE IT WORK.

These episodes look and sound as great as ever... there are even vessels from the ANIMATED series that now appear in the episodes!

Absolutely wonderful!

Every once in a while, I go back in time and rewatch these shows again ""for the first time"".

And now I really can... in their ENTIRETY no less!

Our kids and grandkids are used to modern looking stuff... the old series just don't seem to look as cool or impress them very much.

So - as with the first three orginal Star Wars movies - this is a GREAT way to share a part of television history with our kids and grandkids!

""The Doomsday Machine"" was always my favorite episode of all time, and this show in particular is SPECTACULAR using the new effects. It's like watching an epic motion picture!

Some of the episodes don't show us much... an occasional alien planetary background or a ringed planet we didn't expect.

But then there are the ones where the original affects are still similar, just enhanced and modernized in the way they would have been done had the technology been available in the 1960's.

This is truly Trek at its best... the ONLY way I would have sprung for all 79 episodes.

First, let me say that I didn't feel it was necessary to -Re-record the original theme.  By Season three the original music was still fine.  Also, Many long time trekker fans have known about the incredible limited budget the original series Had.  Matt Jefferies used almost no money to built the sets and what they accomplished with ambient lighting on the sound stages with the reflective lighting was what it was.  What brought Star Trek to the forefront was the incredible acting and writing that propelled the series.  I was also horrified that the original enterprise was replaced with computer generated media. I think Star Trek should be kept as much in it's original state as possible, flaws an all.
I suggest leaving the computer generated graphics and ships for the newer movies and series.......Star Trek is what it was, great science fiction.",1227916800,13,1070,4.916666666666667
308208,5,6300988600,"OK, bear with me a bit here. I need to explain something.

I am a Star Trek fan of long standing, 35+ years at this point.

When I first heard that the original series was going to be re-released with all new effects, I was less than thrilled. Maybe this attitude is foreign to the younger people, but there is, for me, a certain charm in the original effects. While I acknowledge that the effects in the original Star Trek are sometimes not slick as you see in modern films, people need to realize and appreciate that they were working before the time of computer generated graphics -- and on a television budget. In short, the effects on the original series stand as an example of what dedicated, talented people could do when it all had to be done ""the hard way"". And it seemed disrespectful, at least, of that achievement to replace the hard work of those people. In fact, it seemed to me, at first, to really be just another way for more money to be milked out of both the fans and the series.

Then I started thinking. And reading. And considering. And, finally, I decided to take a peek for myself.

What I found is that the new effects are, as expected, as perfect as only a computer can make them. Perfect effects are, really, getting to be a ho-hum thing to me. I realize and recognize that it still takes talent and skill to create effects using a computer, but, honestly, when you can realize on the screen literally anything you want as easily as anything else... well, it just isn't the same. There just isn't that sense of ""Wow, how did they DO that?"" anymore.

But...

What I also found was that great and loving care was taken to preserve and actually enhance the original episodes through the use of this new technology.

Regardless of any debate on the merits of doing it or not, it's done -- and the results are superb.

Not all fans go to ridiculous lengths dressing up and going to conventions and such. I enjoy star trek solely because I feel the characters are well developed, the acting is great (well, most of the time) and the very 60's effects and clothing styles are hilarious. Part of the allure, agreed upon by a friend who has also recently discovered the series, is that for a series set centuries into the future, it is so hopelessy outdated only 40 or 50 years later.

The disks are well protected and are single sided disks. Upon putting in the first disk i saw how the menus were laid out and i thought it was pretty nice how they did it. When the first episode started i expected the prints to be not so good but i was wrong. I feel they looked just fine and i noticed alot of scenes i haven't seen before. The audio was fine also. Im watching them on an Oppo upconverting dvd player and it really makes a difference. I highly recommend these players as they are made well and make your disks look completely different quality wise. I am very happy with my purchase and i think most people will agree that the set is just fine. I bought it from a different seller on amazon and saved some money that way.

308339,4,6300988600,"What can I say about Star Trek: The Original Series that hasn't already been said, I'll try to keep it brief. Way back in the mid 1960s one man had a vision of how the future of humanity could possibly turn out, it was called Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry's secular humanist dream was of a Human Race that had outgrown racism, sexism, war and superstition. Humanity had conquered disease and poverty and had no need for money any longer; for the pursuit of greed and selfish goals had largely been replaced with a desire to better oneself, and expand ones horizons. With the discovery of warp technology, or faster than light travel, the Human Race ventured onto the galactic stage for the first time in its long and turbulent history. Aided by the Vulcans they would then develop a Starfleet, and in time go on to found The United Federation of Planets (based on The United Nations?) an ambitious organization that would forever change the face of the known universe.

The characters of James T. Kirk, Mr Spock, Dr McCoy, Scotty and the other crew members of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 are now pop culture icons. We join in their daring adventures ""to go boldly where no man has gone before"" on a five year mission of exploration. In the galactic voyages of the Enterprise we meet the Vulcans and Romulans, Klingons and Andorians amongst others for the first time. Some fans have pointed out inconsistencies with later series, for example the Klingons in The Original Series don't really look like... Klingons, and all sorts of wild theories have grown as to why modern Klingons look soo different. For a long time the producers of the various Star Trek series and movies had trouble explaining this discrepancy; but if one watches the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise the Klingons have those characteristic armored cranial ridges, and in Enterprise it is also finally revealed why those of Kirk's era look like swarthy thick set Humans. Star Trek was made on a shoestring budget and the concept artists who worked on it had to constantly improvise, and would use almost anything they could get their hands on. The sets are bright and colourful as are the sometimes garish costumes; and the wonderful retro props like the Tricorder or the Communicator are big, functional and cool. When the aliens are made to look truly alien, such as the Gorn or Tribbles, the results are totally hilarious! Despite Star Treks lofty ideals it was very politically incorrect, and I must admit I find this refreshingly entertaining. It was made in an era when men were men, and the women wore revealing miniskirts, but at least in theory the sexes were considered equal. Captain Kirk is an outrageously chauvinistic womanizer who has ego problems and constant jibes are made about Mr Spock's Vulcan heritage by Dr McCoy; this witty onscreen chemistry between the lead trio is what gives the series much of its charm, and can at times be extremely funny indeed!

While Gene Roddenberry's inspiringly optimistic vision of our future is on face value funky, fun and wonderfully camp, for its time it actually was quite a radical series that broke many conservative establishment taboos. It cleverly used the science-fiction genre as a vehicle for making pointed social commentary, critique and criticism of what were then extremely divisive issues. The Original Series also played its small part in the Civil Rights movement by including the character of Uhura, who was one of the first African American women to appear on television, it also included a Japanese American character named Sulu and a Russian character named Pavel Chekov. Considering that the brazen attack on Pearl Harbour during World War II was still fresh in many people's minds; and that Cold War paranoia was at its height, these were indeed brave decisions. Unfortunately Treks later incarnations didn't continue to push the envelope in much the same way by including characters who are openly gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. To this date there has been no convincing explanation why this particular minority group has been so completely excluded from the Star Trek universe; for I mean at its core Star Trek is supposed to be all about celebrating difference and diversity, almost as much as its about portraying a wonderful and bright future for humanity in the stars. The three DVD boxes that The Original Series come in are brilliantly designed, very groovy and colourful just like the series; being yellow, blue and red. The series have been given a basic digital remastering and the picture beautifully cleared up, so one can watch them again and again. The special features are also quite extensive and will provide many hours of in depth enjoyment, and there are even quite alot of hidden ""easter eggs"" too! So if like me you are an avid trekkie, and have only ever seen the later Trek series; then do yourself a big favour and buy Star Trek: The Original Series, for you'll undoubtedly find them most rewarding.

308340,4,6300988600,"So, where to start this review ? Shall I talk about the content and what impact Star Trek-The Original Series (henceforth referred to as ""TOS"") has made on the imagination and conscience of SF-lovers ever since? Neh, besides from mentioning that TOS has done for TV-SF, what ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""2001, a Space Oddessey"" have done for cinema-SF (granted, in hindsight), namely providing us with well written and often thought provoking SF (admittedly with the occasional exceptions) ever since, me think not, others have done this on this site, the web and in writing far more eloquently than I'll ever be able to do. Let's face it, SF , before them on the small as well as the big screen has been juvenile and ""aiming for kicks"" at best for most of the time. That we now enjoy the well written and thought provoking TV-shows and Movies, is in no small part due to the before mentioned events.

So, instead let's talk about releases. Albeit long, long overdue it is gratifying that Paramount finally released TOS in a format a series of the stature of TOS deserves. Not that they had a choice though. In this DVD-age other studios very early on understood that fans of TV-shows wanted to have their favourite shows released in tight season wise boxed dvd-sets (Fox-studios has to be credited for this insight, for being one of the first in regard to the X-Files series). Paramount was relatively late in understanding this. But picked up on the idea when they brought out The ""Next Generation""""-series and the subsequent Star Trek series, at least where DVD-releases were concerned.

A small history lesson is at it's place here. When Paramount Studios took over Desilu Studios in the late sixties (if memory serves Star Trek was well into it's second season), they were gunning for the then hit-series ""Mission Impossible"", no matter what they have stated since then. ""Star Trek"" was just part of the bargain and really not wanted. However when ""Star Trek"" begot a life of it's own far after cancellation, Paramount very, very slowly began to realise that they inadvertently hit upon the unintended motherload. To this date, the acquirement of ""Star Trek"" must stand out as the most profitable deal in TV-history. Paramount has earned billions on a show they didn't pay squat for (remember: They were after ""Mission Impossible""). The result? Especially US-based fans have been paying very dearly ever since (quite literally) for releases aimed at maximizing earnings for the studio. The 1-episode/tape videotapes (repeated for the ""Next Generation""-,""DS-9""-and ""Voyager"" series) and 2 episode/disc dvd-releases are the most evident examples that come to mind. In stark contrast, we Europeans were treated better. Even the poorest of our releases at least contained 2 episodes. Especially the latter release (2-episode/disc dvd-release) has stirred up some strong emotions amongst US-fans after the boxed sets were released, judging from some of the reviews I've read and in my modest opinion rightly so, since they were released at approximately the same time Star Trek- TNG boxed-sets were being released (A fate we Europeans were blissfully spared), Although I agree in small part with one reviewer, who stated that the ""complainers"" could not resist ""instant gratification"", fact remains that Paramount took advantage of the passion of dedicated people, much like your average street corner dope dealer does. They have not done so with overseas fans (although w've had our share of confusing releases), we got the definitive dvd-version to date at the very first go (Makes you wonder though on how Hollywood considers it's own home public). Don't get me wrong though, I do not begrudge anyone making a buck, heck it is after all ""The American Way"" and for that matter everybody's way, American or otherwise, but let's keep it in context here. And as far as another gripe goes, their pricing policies: Yes, they are very expensive compared to other studios, however as long as w're willing to pay for it, we can not in all fairness complain. In this matter I can't really blame them (see my above statement), but only provided we are getting from the get go the version we want!!!

So back at business at hand, how do I rate this edition. Well I give it 4 stars, solely based on how it is released. We Europeans for once had a first, We got this edition before you Americans had (well over a year), mainly because the infamous 2 episode/disc-edition run was not completed yet at that time in the US-market. As far as I can ascertain the US-edition is both in packaging as in content exactly the same as the European one. Quite a few reviewers had gripes with the way the series were packaged i.e. in a hard plastic case per season. I grant them this: it is a bit ackward and yes not the very easiest of boxes to handle. However they are in line with the earlier European releases of the other Trek-series, with which the Americans are not familiar with, since they were issued with the more common standard slipcased cardboard box-sets. I can imagine that this series (together with the Animated Series-Box)looks like an ugly duckling on the shelves in any American Trek-dvdcollection, however on my shelves it does look quite natural with the other series which were released in Europe/Japan(as a limited edition) as hardplastic cased editions from the get go. From a commercial pointview, it made sense that this edition was brought out in the US, based on the European mold. And let's be honest, gripes notwithstanding, this is to date the most compact collection of TOS ever to be released.

Many reviewers commented also about the transfer being used for this edition...Here I've to agree to a considerable degree...Although something has been done for the better to the soundtracks, this is not necessarily so for picture. I know for a fact that there are least two transfer-version floating around. One is a US-version, cleaned up perhaps, used on the US-laserdisc edition and most likely used for ALL of the the dvd versions(including this and the European one). The second transfer-edition is a very much cleaned up (at the time called: re-mastered) version, then especially commissioned for the Japanese Laserdisc boxed version of TOS. I once owned a Japanese LD season-box. And truth to tell, at the time, it was much superior to the US-laserdisc edition picture qualitywise. Anyone who has ever imported Japanese discs, be it laserdisc or dvd, know that japanese do take their special editions very seriously and that their picture/sound-quality is second to none. This transfer is later used for the very last time (as far as I can ascertain) TOS has been released as VHS i.e. the (quite rare) 30th Anniversary UK-VHS edition (3, yes 3 episode/tape-edition, even for European standards quite unique)...But I'm quite sure this transfer-edition is not used for any of the dvd-releases. The big irony of this is that until the enhanced series is being released, that the Japanese LaserDisc boxed-sets is by far the most exceptional edition you could get, This discussion is, however, becoming quite moot though , since TOS is in a stage of being (digitally) re-mastered and enhanced at the moment. So expect a version being released in the future that is quite superior to everything been released to date. That being said however, this edition is the best affordable way to enjoy TOS to date, no matter what anyone else says...

On a final note. I come to my personal grievances to this release, namely the specials. I admit on being one of those nuts who are wanting their movies/tv-shows being released on dvd as complete as possible, specials and all...Or I want the most complete version commercially available and not being afraid to pay for it...That being said I found this edition of TOS lacking, much to my chagrin I've to add...This is not only true for this Trek-dvdincarnation but for others as well, on which I'll comment as I'll be able to. First things first, to be fair to Paramount, TOS is a very old show, shot in days were no one could even imagine the need for extra material intended for releases to the home market. Much of the extras had to be shot after the fact, simply because there were no contemporary extras salvaged at the time (However, there's this guy, Curt McAloney, who's made it his life mission to gather and restore as much of these extra's as possible, including some deleted scenes, which are not to be supposed to exist as is shown on his website ""startrekhistory.com"". Paramount definitively should contact this guy for future releases). Most interviews with cast for example concerning TOS were shot when they were doing the features and relied on their memories at the time, A very large proportion of the extras were made recently for this edition (a whopping 40 years after the fact, much like Paramount's ""Once upon the West""), and admittedly quite well done, with some notable exceptions. However my gripe is that there are some glaring omissions and I'll just state the ones which come to mind:
-)The famous or infamous ""Blooper-reel""; since the early 70ties this has been floating around fan circles and has almost become an legend of its own. Granted, the quality is poor but to have it denied is denying a part of trek-lore...
-)25th Anniversary Special; One of the best done specials about Trek ever...Hosted by Shatner it gives a light hearted overview of 25 years of Trek history. Released on both VHS and LaserDisc, officially endorsed by Paramount, this probably is the most painfull omission....
-)""Inside Star Trek, The Real Story"" By H.Solow and R.Justman, based on the book with the same title. True, not sanctioned by Paramount. But the japanese LD-version gives an insight into the makings of TOS provided by two people who made Star Trek as much as possible as G.Roddenberry did: The Producers...True they have some perceived wrongs to correct (the moneygrabbing moguls, in which service they were supposed to be) but they provide an insight in the making of TOS from a different point of view, which would be a very, very welcome counterbalance to the self-congratulary and selfindulging statements made on the extra's(a mishap occurring on all the extra's of every trek-incarnation). The problem with all the extra's on every Trek-Dvd incarnation is that it sometimes feel like an ongoing glorification of the makers and performers of Trek who made it into the limelight...Some much needed perspective is called for...Her at least is one. Unfortunately Paramount doesn't have the guts to include this one despite their usual disclaimer that everything said does not neccessarily correspond with their (or their mothercompany's) view; So what else is new...
-)The introductions per episode by cast and guest stars for the  UK 30th Anniversary VHS-edition, mentioned above, especially from the ones who are  not around anymore...They have it, why not use them
-)The Discovery Channel Special:""How Star Trek Changed my Life"" hosted by W.Shatner; True, this special (covering on how Trek science became reality in this day and age) was almost certainly still in the making when this set was brought out, but I mention it as a reminder for a future (enhanced ) release

These are omissions I  recall from the top of my head, but I'm sure that I'm missing a couple or so. Hopefully others will amend to these...It is also in conjunction with the transfer-issue the main reason why I can not give this edition the full rating of 5. However knowing the poor track record of Paramount in this respect, they have done a respectable job, Hopefully,very hopefully, their next release will include the remastered series along with the original ones (Japanese transfer, please) along with the omissions I mentioned above...For such a release I would be willing to open my coffers one more time, but knowing Paramount, I would not hold my breath...",1184284800,6,11915,4.9475524475524475

Ok it is not a complete bargain but it is not overexpensive. The packaging is based on the European boxed sets that were produced for the other Trek series. One main advatgae is that since they are made out of hard plastic, they do not damage as easily as other current DVD boxes. Having never seen all episodes, this was quite a revelation. In the beginning of series 1, as has been written, all the characters have not come into place into what would become the classic series. The acting is also quite wooden at times. However it is the screenwriting that is quite good. I had never seen The Menagerie for example and I am not sure that that double episode was the best way to salvage the footage from the ""lost"" pilot The Cage. However all the trademarks of future ST adventures are to be found and it is a pleasure to watch. I do not find the picture quality as bad as some say. I found it worse on the first Next Generation DVD for example. The sound is great also and there are some nice features also so one cannot really complain.

I must have watched each episode  nearly 100 times in my life, so believe me when I tell you there were more than just touch-ups done on these episodes aired on NBC.  They digitally altered and replaced original scenes.  You'll notice significant changes on every scene in space.  The Enterprise, planets and other spaceships are greatly enhanced and even reconfigured, and you'll get different camera angles of the Enterprise from the original scenes.

I find it IMPOSSIBLE to believe that any company putting out anything of this magnitude and expense wouldn't go to the original 35mm prints to bring to DVD, but no. This is a transfer of horrific quality, the orgin of which was obviously the scratchy, scraped damaged 16mm prints sent out to multitudes of local stations for syndicated broadcast, most of whom cut out entire scenes (that no one would notice, so they THOUGHT) to fit in more commercials. To make it even worse, in the 80's they took these horrific prints, cut out a certain percetage of film frames from the ENTIRE FILM they had left, and then SPED UP THE AUDIO, BADLY, to COMPENSATE when making the videotape collections. Willam Shatner SOUNDS LIKE A CHIPMUNK THROUGH THE ENTIRE THING. He should SUE. Nichelle Nichols, a mezzo with a deep voice, turns into a little girl soprano. The movement of everyone is rushed, the pace is relentless, they recut the thing to have more dialog interruptions and people talking over other people's lines wherever they could. The action is jerky as if watching a bad quality AVI with dropped frames.

This collection is HORRENDOUS, a travesty of a great history-making show and possibly the pinnacle of ""old Hollywood"" style filmaking. Must have been overseen by executives in their 30's WHO NEVER SAW THE ORIGINALS, EVEN ONCE.

Save your money for the new HD remasters, even though they'll change a million things, some of which they'll make better, some of which they won't. They can't possibly mess it up any more than this pile. This set is unwatchable junk, unless you like Alvin and the Chipmunks and Keystone Cops.

It's not even worth downloading. I know some people like it, but they can't possibly have ever seen the originals.

Oh, the color scheme of the cases is nice.

UPDATE

Well thanks for the clarification. That would explain the widely disparate responses to this set. I returned mine, so now to be on the safe side I will wait EAGERLY for the remastered versions. From the handful of episodes I've seen on TV, they're FANTASTIC, they did a very respectful bang-up job. The footage of the enterprise orbiting various planets is brilliantly done and adds a realism the original grainy flickering footage that looked like it was shot in the 1940's didn't. Special efx have come a long way.

If these sets are as most of you say they are, then it would be great for real fans to have both versions. I might even take another chance on this set someday.",1169769600,20,2563,4.66740576496674

It is nice to have them, but it is disappointing that not only did Paramount not clean up the video but they used the edited versions for the dvds that were released back in the late 70's to fit in more commercials.  None of the episodes are intact and all have scenes and dialogue missing.  It is a shame that not only does Paramount fail to bother releasing the full versions, but they are hoping that we don't realize it when viewing them.  While some argue they are uncut, the missing parts are indeed gone.  For example, during the episode where the Enterprise is hijacked to Eden in the Neutral Zone, the discussion with McCoy about the leaders deformed and diseased ears is missing.  While the cuts are not significant in length or may seem trivial to some, they do exist.

308368,4,6300988600,"Star Trek was a ground-breaking series, but a few of the episodes (especially early in Season 1 before the main characters come into their own) are pretty painful to watch. 4 stars overall for the 3 seasons, but many of the episodes are 5-star. No doubt you have seen the show on TV (edited to fit in more commercials), and other reviewers on Amazon have written excellent reviews for the single season editions so I won't go into details.  I just want to summarize some information that may be helpful in deciding whether to buy this set now, or wait until later...

First, the set I received had several defective disks (1,6,7 in the first season). The program freezes, then eventually skips from seconds to minutes of the show.  Amazon has a good exchange policy, and I'm hoping I get a good set this time, but I won't know until I go through all the disks and that will take a while.  At least one other reviewer has also recently (fall 2006) received defective disks, so it is likely that there is a bad batch at Amazon at this time.

- UPDATE:  I received the replacement set and have watched all the episodes. It has defects too, but I'm keeping this one as they are relatively short, and only affect two episodes of the three seasons.

Second, as many people have noted in the single-season reviews, this has to be the most impractical packaging yet devised by man.  The outer plastic cases don't stand upright on their own.  They come with what looks like a sales display stand, and will stand upright in these, but I notice the individual stands have been reinforced and weighted in the bottom by what looks like leftover building material.  Inside each case is a stack of plastic trays held together by cellophane tape.  This fits inside a thin paper sleeve which will no doubt tear soon, and the accompanying paper booklet does not fit in the sleeve.  So you have to go though several levels to get to the disks, and the booklet falls out each time.

Third, as others have hinted, Paramount has been remastering all the episodes with new CGI for the ships, and for some other effects. It's the same ship, it just looks real now instead of like a model on a string.  The sound is also being remastered (and in a few cases the music is being re-recorded).  The picture is also being cleaned up.  These episodes are currently airing on affiliate stations as they are completed (also edited to fit in more commercials).  You can go to the Paramount website and navigate through their 'home video' page links/search/etc until you find the Star Trek pages.  There you can download previews and information.  I've seen a couple of these remastered episodes airing locally, and TOS has never looked so good.  Be aware that as of this writing, Paramount has not committed to releasing the re-mastered series on DVD, but I have no doubt that they will as they have a history of getting as much money from Trek fans as possible.

- UPDATE: The revised episodes are being released in dual format (High Def DVD and Standard DVD) beginning with Season 1 in November of 2007 -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Original-Series-The-Complete-First-Season-Combo-HD-DVD-and-Standard-DVD-HD-DVD/dp/B000VDDDY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD</a>]. As of this writing, Amazon's price for the first season is nearly as high as this set of all three seasons. If you are patient, no doubt the price will eventually come down, as this is Paramount's pattern.

The bottom line...if you want the series with all the original effects (cloth backdrops, the same planet tinted different colors, reused ship clips, etc) go for this set.  I doubt if it will get any less expensive than it is at the time of this review.  But download some of the remastered previews from the Paramount site first, and if you can, watch the remastered episodes on TV before making up your mind. They aren't altering anything that significantly changes the show, and it looks stunning compared to this set.  If you want the remastered 'improved' version though, you will have to wait until Paramount releases it (season by season, and eventually the full set), and expect to pay a lot more than this set, unless you are willing to wait a year or more after release.  Finally, if you decide to order this set, check all the disks as soon as possible, as it appears there are defective sets being sold.  Hope this helps in the decision...live long and prosper :-)",1163376000,279,4569,4.839331619537275
308383,5,6300988600,I have always been a fan of star trek from the original all the way to Enterprise.

Amazon's replacement service kindly sent a replacement set the day I was sending the original back--gotta love that; thanks Amazon!  HOWEVER, the replacement was not packaged completely.  My replacement set did not include individual cardboard envelopes for the three plastic hard cases.  (The holder which holds the three hard cases together was there; but each hard case is further protected by a cardboard envelope, which helps keep them from rubbing against each other in the holder.  This is important; because each hard case has chrome-like lettering which could rub off over time without the added protection.  This is apparently a QC issue wherever the sets are assembled--I do not think Amazon was to blame).  So, regrettably, I returned this set as well.  Just be aware you may receive a set which doesn't contain individual cardboard envelopes for each plastic hard case.

Having grown up watching ST TOS in syndication in the 70's and actually going to one of the first Star Trek conventions in New York, I love this show. Has it influenced me and my morals? Absolutely!

308389,5,6300988600,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1400 minutes per box, you are looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. The TOS series ends with series III. The total number of TOS episodes from season I to season III is 80. Running time for TOS is approx 60 hours. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is beautiful. Make sure to retain the cardboard holder that it sits into as this helps stability on the shelf (although the box can still stand alone the bottom is a little narrow). The shell cracks open down the centre to reveal a box. Sliding out of the box is a small booklet insert with discs in a well designed plastic holder that flip from disc to disc. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 8 discs in total. However the last disc, disc 8, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 30 episodes. The rest of disc 8 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Several of the shows come with a commentary. All the episodes have been remastered to the point that scratches and artefacts are hardly visible. The special effects have been touched up slightly (no strings), however they still retain an overall early look and feel, especially the initial episodes that have budget restrictions. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season One, is a fine example of the growing stages of any television series. Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed shows the vision shaping. Spock is the only character to be retained from the pilot episode `The Cage'. Kirk appears after this one. Chekov does not appear until Season Two. Yeoman Smith appears in quite a number of Season One episodes before retiring from the show. The little known Nurse Chapel also appears here as well as the other series. The Enterprise itself is a mere hunk of plastic that does not improve much until Season Two and is funny to see. There are very little space shots in Season One because of the limitations of visual effects. The main viewer of The Bridge looks like a projector screen and is avoided much of the time. When something does appear there it looks completely phoney... and funny. Spock's makeup design goes through a few changes. However, even though we can laugh at much of Season One now, the series does gel and soon we have some fascinating sci-fi theory and execution, even though what we are watching is the equivalent of a stage play. Nobody can critic the quality of the television acting and not since Flash Gordon had the world seen anything like it before. The stories (mostly by DC Fontana) are slightly narrow in their field of vision, however these where to mature in later seasons. Season One of TOS is mostly about alien illusions, shape shifters, psi-power, viruses, alternative universes, intergalactic slavery, military trials, deities, time travel and close hand to hand combat with aliens. There is also the unforgettable award winning `The City on the Edge of Forever' starring Joan Collins. `Operation: Annihilate!' has the flying face huggers type creatures that the movie `Alien' ripped off. Kahn appears in this series. We have both Klingons and Romulans also. The classic `Devil in the Dark' sees Kirk and Spock fight an underground cave monster. Kirk goes hand to hand with a giant reptile in the episode `Arena'. Surprisingly enough very few episodes actually contain all the characters at one time, including Sulu and Scotty. This does not happen until Season Two and then occurs often in Season Three. In TOS Season One characters are sort of alternated from episode to episode. The bottom line for TOS: Season One is that it is a classic. Although it is not necessarily the best of the Seasons, it works well as a very good foundational study for Trekkies who will absolutely adore seeing the variations in design and theme. All in all this is the funny season for 21st century viewers. You are supposed to laugh at this one more than thinking about its topics. And what a laugh it is! Just watch Kirk roll about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume. How can you not want that!

Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Two, starts to get a budget based on the ratings of TOS Season One. The Enterprise has undergone a new design and looks more than just a hunk of plastic hanging from a string... although not by much. The Bridge looks bigger with more components and consoles. Chekov, who was not in Season One, makes his first appearance here. Season Two has more space shots and attempts are made to film the Enterprise making manoeuvres. Costumes are brushed up a bit, but Kirk's new green sweater might attract some debate. The intro credits have an irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. Both the Green sweater and the *ding* are done away with in Season Three. Apart from a few questionable episodes the series does takeoff in the right direction. There is an instalment with the character Dr. Zefram Cochrane who appears in the movie First Contact. There are themes of rapid aging, furry pets, alien abduction, telepathy, Nazis, advanced computers and time travel. Scotty appears more often than usual. We are introduced into our first space station that looks like pre-deep space nine. The alien costumes are given a sprucing up. In one episode there is a gathering of about twelve various life forms. The big plus side is in the quality of the dialogue between the characters. Spock and Bones go at one another more often. There is tension on deck as well as post-mayhem humour and analysis. At the end of each episode Kirk usually makes a statement to round up the day's affairs. They even crack a joke or two. It is worth it for the episodes ""Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""Patterns of Force"", along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The main thing you will like about Season Two is the improved interaction between the characters. The camera also pans and dollies more, with lots of handheld making the visuals less static than in Season One. The credits and end credits also undergo a revamp, including titles that appear as the episode starts and ends and not just along with the music. There is lots of experimentation and improvement here that has since stood the test of time. The budget boost was certainly worth it.

Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Three, continues to improve on visual effects and camera work, based on the big budget of Season Two's success. Although the bridge and the Enterprise model have not undergone much of a revamp since Season II the characters are beefed up and the acting is more refined. Kirk looses his green sweater that attracted some debate in Season Two. The credits are now in blue and the music no longer has the irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. There are themes of body organ theft, genetic manipulation, memory loss, alien possession, insanity, time travel, apocalypses, dimensions, psychic powers, empathy, love potions, discrimination, alien abduction, over population, immortality and the sixties. Scotty undergoes several different hairdos. This series is also the one where Kirk kisses Uhura, in ""Plato's Stepchildren"", the first interracial kiss on American television. In fact Kirk goes on to kiss all the women in Season Three! It is worth it for the episodes ""The Cloud Minders"", ""The Tholian Web"", ""Spectre of the Gun"", ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The final disc contains the pilot episodes ""The Cage"" in two different versions. The `original version' is in fact a copy of a black and white broadcast even though it was shot in color. The color edition can be found in the ""restored version"". Anyway both pilot versions are here in Season III. ""The Cage"" was eventually remade into an episode and aired. This aired version can be found in TOS Season One. The main thing you will like about Season Three is how it genuinely makes attempts to expand on science-fiction concepts. Additionally there are quite a few story twists that will surprise. At the same time this was to be the final season for TOS, cancelled in the middle of the height of the 60s (summer of 1969) due to low ratings. It is sad when you come to the end of Series III knowing that you have spent the last few months enjoying being beside Kirk, Spock, Bones and Scotty but this did not stop Gene Roddenberry from pitching the idea to turn Star Trek into motion picture films. Thanks to that we have these box office successes to keep us going. Now boldly onto Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) Series I!!!!!!!",1132790400,30,10133,4.730203619909502
308390,3,6300988600,"I got this set last December and slowly watched the episodes in order, after not having seen them for many, many years.  If you're buying this set, it's obvious that you already love the original series, so I won't spend time debating which are the greatest episodes, but they're all here, with a decent amount of bonus features to boot, including a dedicated ""Life After Trek"" for each main cast member, interviews with the writers and producers, and text commentary from writers on selected episodes (typically the Okudas).  The episodes are in air-date order, rather than production order; I don't know if this is a bone of contention with die-hard fans.

I give this DVD set 3 stars and not 5 because:

-I would have liked more bonus footage (gag reel? outtakes, deleted scenes? Shatner performing Rocket Man?)

-better film cleanup was needed for some of the episodes.  Some are excellent, and the color looks great across the board, but you can see that the film is dirty/damaged in some places.  There is one stock shot they use all the time which is really filthy (the Enterprise circling a planet).

I figured, ""What the hell, I'll give it a try.""  I was not disappointed.  The characters are well-played; the concept, refreshing for the 1960's; and the writing, downright witty on many occasions.  Star Trek The Original Series is a great addition to my library.",1127260800,3,402,4.852941176470588
308408,5,6300988600,"This is truely a great series to watch! One day I may be damned for asking it, but would we truely remember it the same way had it not ended at season 3?  I think what makes the original series so much a part of popular television culture is that it had so much against it that it was brought down in it's prime.  It was only due to die hard fans who kept watching it once it hit syndication that the legacy began to build and people started to remember it fondly instead of turning a blind eye as they once had.  In turn, it built a wonderful empire of dreams and hopes for a better tomorrow.  Say what you will, but none of the other spinoffs (and their longer broadcast schedules) can hold a candle to the original series.

To be able to see it without worrying if I'll make it home on time, if I remembered to set the VCR, how late it will be on or how many ad breaks will there will be is a great relief.  And to be let in on so much of the history of the show!  To think that they graced season 3 with the Star Trek pilot that could have been...but never was...in two different versions!  As for the sound and picture quality, it's still better than most broadcast copies I've seen.  Over time, only so many sound and picture elements survive...and especially when it's been in such heavy syndication.  In order to perserve some of the special sounds I'm sure that Paramount was forced to only remove the most offensive and problematic static noise and leave the rest alone.

I could list names of shows that are my favorites or reveal plot lines and such...but other people have already made their reviews the same so I'll save more time by also saying it's really amazing how the cast really did help carry the show in every episode.  No need for me to remind everyone of the Holy Trinity of this show...without them it would have crumbled in the wind.

I'll take a slight moment and agree with the one reviewer here who stated that Paramount has overpriced these box sets (individually and even all together).  They have! The high price scares some of my friends from buying the set, and that's a shame because they aren't die hard Trek fans like others I know.  Lowering the price would remove fears from those curious enough to buy, which would mean more buisness for Paramount.

What's weird (or worse, some may soon cry) is that where I live now (Finland) I picked up each season (individually) for 40 Euros!  As of today (Sept. 19, 2005), that's only $48.59 !  Even all seven ST:TNG box sets are priced individually that low! Quite a price difference on my friends who still live in the United States.  It doesn't matter how many Trek fans live in Finland, the USA OR the rest of the world, but I believe that Paramount should be FAIR to all Trek fans!  At least have a limited time campaign sale to help perk up sales of Star Trek and remove some of these lovely sets from the shelves where they are collecting dust because of the overprice.

To end on a good note, this ENTIRE original series is worth owning.  Paramount must still be commended for making the effort to put out a tv show still making syndicated runs all over the world and giving us access to the troubled yet glorious past it had. It made tv history many times, and remains part of the world's popular culture today.  Star Trek lives on...",1127088000,9,3323,4.358766233766234
308409,4,6300988600,"As with so many young people growing up in the 1960's, the original Star Trek television series became a part of who I eventually became as an adult. Ever since, I wondered if it would become practical to own all those original episodes for convenient viewing. Over the years, I saw the huge VHS collection come and go, but it's size and cost made it prohibitive to own. Then came the DVD versions that still had only a couple of episodes per disk - the same reservations applied. Finally, the entire three year collection is available in a small package at a reasonable price. While I have not watched all of the many disks yet (who wants to rush a thing like this?), what I have seen is well organized, packaged, and transferred from the film originals. Picture and sound is as good as can be expected from something that was probably not expected to last at the time of its creation.

The boxed set consists of three heavy plastic clam-shell boxes, each containing a printed episode directory and guide (a fold-out style booklet) and a high-density folding disk carrier. There are four episodes per DVD, and the basic specials include the 'next week' trailers and some basic audio options. Special features are included in each set, but I have not watched these yet.

Within the constraints of the DVD medium, I don't know of a more affordable and practical way of owning this collection.",1126483200,10,1391,4.673469387755102

308413,5,6300988600,"This series may seem dated to any person that wasn't born in the 1950s, but to anyone that watched it since the inception, they know it was ahead of its time. Gene Roddenberry's vision lives on today even though the most recent edition of the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Long before Star Wars this series caught the attention of SciFi fans that had only black & white Twilight Zone and Outer Limits before. This wonderfully colorful series did very well with the very limited budget they had. Look at all the things influenced by this series. There were no portable flip open phones, small data discs for computers, PDAs, or dozens of other items influenced by this series at the time it originally aired. Many first such as the interracial kiss were seen here. It truly asked questions that are still asked today. I have to tell you I liked the music more than in the last couple of Star Trek series.

Only one thing puzzled me with this wonderful set. The order of the airings. If indeed these are in the order they were originally aired, then whoever decided to put them in that order should have been slapped up side the head. It has been to many years for me to recall what order I saw them in, but this does not seem correct. Anyone that followed the original series knows they all had tan uniforms in the beginning, then blue and other colors, etc. Doctor McCoy was the third doctor to appear in the series. Watching this set in the order they have them will make you think he was the first, then another doctor filled in, then another doctor did ""The Cage"" which is shown at the end of the series instead of at the beginning in this set. You will also note that when you do watch the two pilots, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" and ""The Cage"", they will seem out of place because as I mentioned all of a sudden the uniforms will look older and Spock will be shouting more.

Call me persnickity, but I would like to have seen the two pilots shown first in the set and then the rest the series. At any rate I like the way they are boxed, the fact they are so compact, and they include the trailers. I actually had purchased all this set when they were two per disc, but after seeing all this set offered I donated the other set and bought this one. The other set took up two shelves of a bookcase compared to the less than a third of shelve for this entire set. They also did not include any commentaries or the previews. The quality is extremely sharp and clear. I recommend any fan of any Star Trek series or movies seriously consider getting the original series that started it all. My only real complaint is that Paramount is greedy. I wish people would boycott them. I love Scifi series and I buy the majority of them. Stargate SG-1 is another great series. MGM is not greedy like Paramount's Loaches. It will cost you about fifty bucks for one season of Stargate. You know how it cost over one hundred bucks to buy any one season of Star Trek. If anyone can afford to buy out Paramount and put prices right you will have the hearts of Star Trek fans forever. This set is at least in the ball park of reasonably priced, but it should be selling for about one hundred and sixty to be competitive with all the other great TV series on DVD.",1119052800,10,3256,4.327332242225859

BUT.

Why, why are they making us shell out all the big time cabbage for this set? Compared to other season sets, you have to mortgage your house to buy this one. They don't even give you anything special for buying the whole set other than wrapping them all together in a little cardboard sleeve. And it's bad enough Paramount is making a major cash grab...I discovered the other day that there are other extras that they've included on European sets BUT not the North American one.

They include:

Kiss & Tell - Romance In The 23rd Century (8:19): William Shatner and story editor Dorothy Fontana talk about the multitude of women that Kirk managed to get 'involved' with during the course of the show. Also includes Nichelle Nichols talking about some suggestive scenes between Uhura and Scotty and Walter Koenig talks about the revealing costumes the actresses wore on the show.

Trekker Connections (3:42): A little game for the viewer to play with cast members like six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

Star Trek's Favourite Moments (17:09): Cast and crew members from the newer shows such as Michael Dorn (TNG), Ethan Philips (Voy), John Billingsley (Ent), Jeffrey Combs (DS9), Vaughn Armstrong (Ent), Robert O'Reilley (TNG) and Tim Russ (Voy) talk about their memories of the show.

Collectible Trek (14:26): Paramount archivist Penny Juday talks about the money that some people will pay for genuine Star Trek collectibles.

Considering the serious gouging, it wouldn't have killed them to stuff these on here. There's also trailers for The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager DVD sets they didn't include but that's just as well since there's disclaimers to sell Trek DVD product all over the DVDs. I bought the set, they have my money and now they want more of it?

All in all, it is a tremendous set, considering the major cash you had to spend before buying all the episodes individually. It just would've been nice to see Paramount really roll back the price tag and roll out the red carpet for the Trek fans who've been lining their pockets all these years.",1109462400,58,2310,4.7984886649874054

There are long menu delays between you and your voyage.

308442,4,6300988600,"I couldn't give Star Trek any less than 4 stars simply because it's Star Trek, a show that I've been watching since I was a baby, and has had an immense influence on my life.  The Original Series is an important show, and finally being able to get it in an all-in-one package for a (fairly) reasonable price has taken too long.  There was no way I as a rabid Star Trek fan wasn't going to beg for this for Xmas.  I'm glad I have it in my collection.

But if I could give a separate rating to the quality of the transfer, I'd give it 2 stars.  How ironic that a show that deals with humans using technology to achieve and explore has been released by humans witholding technology to maximize profit.  Despite a new, cleaned up digital mix of the audio, the video portion of the DVD's still contains the little scratches and video noise that my original videotapes possessed when I bought them in the 80's.  There have been too many old movies and TV shows digitally remastered and beautified for me to believe that they couldn't clean these episodes up and give us better picture quality. It's a crime that Paramount continues to milk the original Trek dynasty like this.

It's quite obvious that there will be yet another re-release of the series down the road, but I can't see waiting any longer.  The Harry Mudds have won again.",1104105600,207,1330,4.440329218106996
308443,5,6300988600,"Even with five spinoffs,ten movies and nearly 40 years of history,The original Star Trek is the one that started it all and continue to inspire millions of fans.
The plot was simple, in the future a starship goes out on a five year mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and civilizations. Led by the heroic Captain James T. Kirk (willian Shatner) along with his Vulcan first officer Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy).The other crew members include Dr. Leonard McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley),Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott(the late James Doohan), Helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takai),Communications officer Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and Yoaman Janice Rand (Grace Lee whitney who would only last half the first season).
Despite the cheap looking special effects and set pieces,ST was a mixture of action,humor,drama and morality tales. A far cry from other science fiction shows airing at the time such as Lost In Space. Classic first season episodes includes The Naked Time,The Enemy Within, The Menagerie ,The Conscience of the King, Balance of Terror(the Romulan's debut), Space Seed(KHAN!!!), Arena,This Side of Paradise,The Devil in the Dark, and the greatest Trek episode of all time, The City on the Edge of Forever.
After barely getting renewed for a second season, ST came back the next year in full force. The biggest hero was not Captain Kirk himself,but Gene Coon. The executive producer who contributed some of the best episodes, as well as set the tone for the show which inspired future Trek's as well.
One of the prime factors for the second season's brilliance was the actors fleshing out their characters. The famous trio of Kirk-Spock -McCoy were finally established at the focal point of the show. The remaining supporting characters performed admirably , along with the introduction of Ensign Paval Chekov (Walter Keonig). Many classic episodes came from season two(Mirror,Mirror, Amok Time, Doomsday Machine, Deadly Years,Trouble With Tribbles, A Piece Of The Action, Journey to Babel).
As brilliant as season two was, it was not enough to get high numbers in the Neilsons. Thanks to a letter campaign by fans led by Bjo Trimble, ST was renewed for a third season. But with Coon's departure from the show after the second season, the third season suffered and even the fans couldn't save it.
 The third season had two disadvantages when it returned. Along with Coon's departure from the series, Gene Roddenberry's involvement with the show decreased, frustrated with NBC lack of interest of the low rated show  along with the new timeslot on Friday at 10:00 PM, a slot known to bury flagging shows by the networks.
Over the years, many blamed the new producer Fred Frieberg for the lacking quality of the show. Freiberg's only sin was coming aboard a sinking ship which was suffering budget cuts as well as weak stories and it's creator's lack of interest due to the networks total disregard of the show.
Even with the few brilliant episodes (Empath, Paradise Syndrome,Enterprise Incident, Tholian Web, Requium Of Methuselah,All Our Yesterdays), season three is notorious with two of the worst ever in the history of Trek (The Way To Eden<space hippies>, and Spock's Brain).
By the end of season three,ST was finally cancelled after 78 aired episodes in 1969. Even fans couldn't save it, as NBC buried the show. But thanks to syndication, ST became even more popular than when it originally aired and build upon a growing franchise (Conventions, Saturday Morning cartoons,toys, etc,).The ten years after the end of the series,Star Trek The Motion Picture premired. And that was just the beginning.

308444,5,6300988600,"An epic sci-fi phenomenon began in 1966 when the first season of ""Star Trek"" began to broadcast on U.S. televisions.  Created by the legendary writer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991), the series was intended to run for five years detailing the missions of the mammoth starship known as the U.S.S. Enterprise, which was only one of several starships that were part of the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet.  Unfortunately, the series was prematurely cancelled after only three complete seasons in spite of efforts of Gene Roddenberry, letter-writing campaigns conducted by fans to keep the show alive and 5 Emmy Award nominations.  Ironically, it was only six weeks after the final third-season episode was broadcast (6/3/1969) that astronauts Neil Armstrong and 'Buzz' Aldrin became the first human beings to ever set foot on an extraterrestrial world, Earth's moon, on 7/20/1969.  Then, instead of being forgotten after cancellation, in syndication, ""Star Trek"" began to rise in popularity in the early 1970's to such an extent that Paramount Pictures began toying with the idea of resurrecting the show.  Instead, following the extremely successful 1977 sci-fi blockbuster film ""Star Wars"" (written and directed by George Lucas), Paramount Pictures did resurrect the show in the form of several big-screen films beginning in 1979.  With a new generation being introduced to the fantastic universe created by Gene Roddenberry, more ""Star Trek"" television series were created.  In total, there have been six ""Star Trek"" television series (5 live-action, 1 animated) and ten big-screen films; but all of them owe their thanks not only to Gene Roddenberry, but to the original ""Star Trek"" series cast and the many fans that kept the original show in syndication long after it was cancelled.

The main original ""Star Trek"" series characters of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Lt. Commander/Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard H. 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999), Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Keonig from 1967-1969), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney from 1966-1967) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) have become an inseparable part of Americana.  Together, they starred in 79 broadcasted episodes: 29 in the first season, 26 in the second season and 24 in the third & final season.  The show's unaired pilot episode, ""The Cage"" (which starred a nearly completely different cast), was recycled during the show's first season as part of the two-part episode ""The Menagerie"".  Guest stars that appeared on one or more episodes include (but are not limited to):

* Joan Collins (in the only Emmy Award-winning episode, the first season's ""The City on the Edge of Forever"").

* Roger C. Carmel (1932-1986, in first-season episode ""Mudd's Women"" and second-season episode ""I, Mudd"").

* Ricardo Montalban (as Khan Noonian Singh in first season episode ""Space Seed"", a role he reprised in the 1982 film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"").

* Mark Leonard & Jane Wyatt (as Spock's parents, Sarek & Amanda, in second-season episode ""Journey to Babel"", roles they reprised in several big-screen ""Star Trek"" films).

* Diana Muldaur (in second-season episode ""Return to Tomorrow"" and a different character in third-season episode ""Is There No Truth in Beauty"").

* Teri Garr (in second-season episode ""Assignment: Earth"").

Originally, when Paramount Pictures first released the original series of ""Star Trek"" on DVD in the 1990's, they did so on 40 DVD's, with 2 episodes per DVD.  The full retail cost to own all 40 DVD's was enormous.  Then, starting this year, Paramount Pictures started to re-release the original series in three DVD boxed sets (one set for each season, about 8 DVD's per set) at only a fraction of the cost of the previously released 40-DVD set.  Hence, being able to purchase all three season boxed sets together is still a huge bargain.  Therefore, for being a fantastic TV series that started a phenomenon that continues through to this day and for a great price, I rate the complete ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" set of three box sets with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  If you, or anyone you know, doesn't yet own any of the ""Star Trek"" boxed sets, this set of all three original series boxed sets would make a fantastic gift!",1103155200,5,4406,5.174647887323943

308448,5,6300988600,"Where, exactly, does one start talking about THE original series that single-handedly launched the TV sci-fi genre like none that came before it and none has done since? What does one say about the one sci-fi show against which all subsequent sci-fi seems to be some kind of lesser imitation or spinoff? Should discussion begin with the original and imaginative concepts and themes - space warp, time travel, alternate realities and universes, powers of the mind and spirit, transporter beams - or should discussion start by talking about how masterfully familiar human interest themes are woven into a technological vision of the future? Or, maybe discussion should begin with how perfectly the show's central characters both complement and supplement each other at multiple levels of the human experience - the decisive commander-warrior, the rational half-human science officer, and the empathetic healer?

 Ever since I began staying up late Friday nights to watch the original airings with my parents almost forty years ago, viewing rerun after rerun in syndication for the next fifteen years, sometimes twice a day, every day, and watching the spinoffs throughout the next fifteen years, the answers to those questions have always stayed just out of my reach. The problem has always been that my favorite Trek episode was usually the one I happened to be watching, or, if I hadn't been watching one, my top choices seemed to wander from episode to episode from day to day, even from morning to noon to night. I was vaguely aware that it had something to do with who I was, or what I was experiencing as a person at that particular moment.

 For me, the highlights of season one exemplify my sentiments, from ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", the powerful opening episode (which was aired out of sequence, for some strange reason) where two crew members, one a personal friend of Captain Kirk, become endowed with mental powers that grow to such strength as to make them a danger to the ship and crew, to the question and problem of time travel raised in ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", which is regarded by many fans as possibly the best sci-fi episode ever produced.

 Oh, but then there's ""Space Seed"", whose sequel was produced in the feature film, ""The Wrath of Khan"", where the Enterprise is commandeered by a rogue group of genetically-engineered super-leaders from the 20th century. Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the two most memorable performances of his career as the charismatic but overly-ambitious Khan. It is even more impressive when one considers that genetic engineering was barely a blip on the scientific radar in 1965 when the episode was written and filmed.

 Who can forget ""Balance of Terror"", which was Trek's rendition of the movie classic ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", which tells the story of two seasoned commanders playing a deadly game of cat and mouse in in deep space? This episode features Mark Lenard, who would also act the part of Spock's father in several future TV episodes and the feature film, ""The Search for Spock"".

 Season 1 also gives fans the first glimpse of the mischievous but lovable space-rogue Harcourt Fenton (aka ""Harry"") Mudd in ""Mudd's Women"". Viewer beware - do not allow the episode's light-hearted tone to obscure it's message, that physical beauty is merely an outward manifestation of one's true, inner beauty.

 After the resounding success of season one, season two delivered more of the same while yet retaining the original and imaginative themes and character development. Deforest Kelley, acting the part of Dr. McCoy, is now billed as a leading part in the series, and we are introduced to the young, quirky, and often funny Pavel Chekov.

 Season two gives us our first look at the mysterious Vulcan ritual of ""pon farr"" - the boiling of the Vulcan blood - which drives Vulcans to mate every seven years. ""Amok Time"" places Kirk between a rock and a hard place as he is maneuvered by a scheming Vulcan female to battle his friend and first officer Spock. The theme of the first Star Trek feature film is also foreshadowed in season two as the crew of the Enterprise are sieged by Nomad, an old Earth space probe that was reprogrammed by an advanced civilization to fulfill its original mission - return to its creator, at all costs.

 Season two also led the sci-fi genre as it explored the subject of alternate realities and universes in ""Mirror, Mirror"", where a transporter accident causes Kirk and his landing party to switch places with their counterparts in an evil, chaotic universe. Rationality is constant in both universes, though, as ""evil"" Spock figures out what happened and aids ""good"" Kirk and co. in their return home.

 ""The Doomsday Machine"" tackles the problem of weapons of mass destruction 35 years before the concept became a household term. Always on the cutting edge of sci-fi, season two brings the viewer back to Harry Mudd, who returns in ""I, Mudd"" a whimsical adaptation of Asimov's ""I, Robot"" crossed with ""The Stepford Wives"". Environmental responsibility is addressed in the perennial fan favorite, ""The Trouble with Tribbles"", which features a warm fuzzy exotic species that overruns both the Enterprise and a deep-space station while consuming a critical supply of super-wheat.

 Season two is also rich in material that examines Earth's own history. Imperial governments are critiqued in ""Bread and Circuses"", where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy encounter the survivors of a previous space-wreck who have modeled a society using Earth's ancient Roman Empire as a model. ""A Piece of the Action"" revisits the issue of culture contamination as Kirk and Co. encounter an entire planet culture organized around a book called ""Chicago Mobs of the 20s"". A social experiment runs out of control in ""Patterns of Force"" as a society is transformed into a 23d century version of Nazi Germany.

 At a time when most computers were used for experimental purposes in scientific labs, ""The Ultimate Computer"" addresses the questions of what might happen if computers ever get smart enough to act on their own volition. History is studied directly for the first time ever in ""Assignment: Earth"", as the crew of the Enterprise employ their knowledge of the ""whiplash effect"" to purposefully travel through time. Their investigation of the first moon launch is interrupted as they intercept the mysterious spy-master Gary Seven beaming in from a far-away planet.

 Season three is often criticized as being the least original and interesting of the three original Star Trek seasons. Although there may be some truth to that sentiment, I believe it is a matter of degree. To say it is the least interesting of the three is not the same as saying that it is not worth watching. There are still many good episodes to stir the imagination.

 In a theme repeated in future Trek spinoffs, Kirk feigns madness leading to his capture by the Romulans in order to execute his master plan to commit espionage aboard a Romulan ship in ""The Enterprise Incident"". ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" is a powerful allegory of the irrational and destructive nature of racism. The feasibility of artificial intelligence was correctly surmised long before the leading researchers in the field reached the same conclusion in ""Requiem for Methuselah"" where Kirk and Co. encounter a super-genius who has created a seemingly perfect robot spouse who, in the end, is shown to be nothing more than a sophisticated machine incapable of human feelings. ""All Our Yesterdays"" revisits the time travel theme in a wonderfully written story about Kirk, Spock, and McCoy's encounter with an automated librarian who is the caretaker of the archives of a great civilization that abandoned its homeworld as their sun nears the end of its life in a catastrophic explosion.

 As I watch all these episodes again for what must be the eighth or ninth time, I still see things for the first time I somehow managed to miss throughout all my previous viewings, and I still find myself pondering the large questions of life: who and what is man?, love and hate, war and peace, faith and reason, and all the other issues related to our purpose in this life.
