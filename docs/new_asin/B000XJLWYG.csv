8228708,5,B000XJLWYG,"This wonderfully playful documentary accurately captures a truly unique American city.  I first saw this on PBS in the early 80's.  I somehow managed to get it on VHS but lost it during Hurricane Katrina.  Now I finally have it on DVD.  I have only two complaints about this wonderful program:  The music is incredible but uncredited, so I've never been able to buy it; and clocking in at just under 40 minutes, it's a little pricey at $20.  Nevertheless, I'm thrilled to finally own it and have, in fact, purchased three more copies for gifts.",1419379200,,544,4.614583333333333
8228709,5,B000XJLWYG,"There's a saying - Key West, where the weird go pro.  This look back at Key West of yesterday is really fun, even if you've never been there.",1371686400,2,141,4.035714285714286
8228710,5,B000XJLWYG,"A self-critical perfectionist, creative type (with no financial interest in this one), I was delighted to see how repeatable, fascinating, and funny this piece will always be.  Against heavy competition, it deserves its many awards.  Still fresh and zany for 32 years, it easily passes the ultimate test of time.  Kudos to partner Anna Benson.",1252972800,3,343,5.2
8228711,5,B000XJLWYG,"This tongue-in-cheek mock documentary remains a classic, and is as funny after a dozen viewings as it was when I bought it years ago. It's a 40-minute cinematic joke about the oddball residents of Key West and the frenzied tourists who visit them.  The interviews may be genuine -- but oh so strange! -- and the tourists are often as clueless now as they were back then.  The film was made in the 70s, done in the style of the 50s. There is really no place like Key West, no other film quite like this.
