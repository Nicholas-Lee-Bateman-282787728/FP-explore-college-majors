8172303,5,B000MTSU8S,No one can take Edith Piaf's place.  But Mireille Mathieu came close enough.... I have been her fan over her entire career.  This DVD shows a good resume of her work.,1277337600,4,166,4.32258064516129
8172304,5,B000MTSU8S,"For fans of Mireille Mathieu this DVD is an absolute must.  [For those who have never heard of her, this would be a good place to start].  She was probably 59 when she did this concert in 2005, and on a couple of the early numbers (songs that she would have belted out easily in her prime), there's a little wobble in her voice, but it's actually kind of endearing,  and the signature voice is quite intact.  The orchestra reveals a polished and ardent familiarity with Mireille's music, and the audience--which includes devotees from around the world--is clearly in love with her.  What a show!

I would also mention that by going online (Amazon fr: then, dvd: Mireille Mathieu), you can buy the DVD for 4,86 euros, plus ca. 9 euros for shipping which translates to ca. 19.88 dollars.  This DVD ships from France, and: it is formatted in PAL (not NTSC, in other words, you need a region-free dvd player to play it) and there are no English subtitles; it is, however, in glorious widescreen and the audio is crystal clear.  Shipping took 8 or 9 days.",1232064000,7,1050,4.547872340425532
