7288976,5,B00ZQ4V6VM,"This is a must watch DVD  I think Alec Mapa is one of the funniest,  kindest,  sweetest guys I've ever seen perform. His stories of love with his husband and his son are incredible plus he makes me laugh until I spit soda out my nose.",1434412800,2,234,4.043478260869565
7288977,5,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Alec Mapa's comedy is a rare blend of side-splitting and heart-rending. Case in point: ""Baby Daddy,"" his fabulous account of how everything changed when he and his husband adopted a 5-year-old boy. Along with outrageously funny descriptions of life as a new father (and a killer Bette Davis imitation), he offers up pointed and poignant observations about the realities of parenting a child who's come to expect impermanence. Don't be surprised to find yourself laughing through tears. It's a sweet, hilarious journey -- one that's well worth taking.",1434412800,,550,5.261363636363637
7288978,5,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Alec's family is beautiful and I'm so glad he was able to share his sweet story with all of us. You will laugh, get ""misty"" and walk away with a whole new appreciation of what family means. Do yourself a favor watch this today!",1434412800,,227,4.181818181818182

8720645,1,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Sorry, but didn't make me laugh.",1469836800,,32,4.5
8720646,2,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Sorry, I watched piece and at the risk of appearing contrarian, Alec, while he is affable and seems like a good guy, is no comedian.  I will agree with some other reviewers that say he tells stories well, but if I want that I will look for it out of the purview of 'comedy specials.'  The tales were mildly entertaining but for the most part they are the same grumblings many performers run to about their wacky families and the trials and tribulations of the like.  I didn't and don't see the hoopla. Good luck with the new baby.",1456963200,,530,4.333333333333333
8720647,5,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Incredibly funny and entertaining!  Alec Mapa gives us a peek into his family's life, and while it is touching (especially hearing about the changes when his family gained an adopted son), it is also absolutely hilarious!  Loved it!",1454025600,,232,5.078947368421052

8720651,5,B00ZQ4V6VM,"Rarely do you find the comedy piece that can make you laugh your heart and cry your eyes out so completely.  This is a show for everyone, and it has the power to shape social opinions of ""alternative families"" in a very positive way.  I saw the film in 2014 and have been patiently waiting for it to come out on video so I can watch it at home with my kids.  BRAVO!",1434499200,,365,3.9726027397260273

He brilliantly delivers a message and a perspective everyone in the world should witness.",1434412800,,349,4.645161290322581
