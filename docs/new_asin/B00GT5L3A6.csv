I especially liked trying to figure out the locales of each scene.  Good job Tim and Andy.  Hope to see more in the future.",1388707200,,258,4.425531914893617

6111833,4,B00GT5L3A6,"This movie doesn't have a huge budget, but what is achieved with a rather small budget ends up being just as satisfying, if not more so, than most big budget flicks. This movie is fun. We get some awesome chase scenes, we get some hilarious and gory kill scenes, and we get some down right side splitting lines and unexpected absurdity. The acting is a little shaky at times, but it can also be surprisingly solid at others. Overall a really enjoyable romp in the much under used sub-sub-genre of road horror films.",1388275200,,515,4.548387096774194
6111834,4,B00GT5L3A6,"A Lee Vervoort flick.

Where to start this written tribute to a great actioner on wheels?

Loved,Loved this flick.

We got a PLYMOUTH TRAIL DUSTER from Hell,A CAMARO that needs work and yet kicks up some dust of its own every other scene.

The devices of the Bad Truck include a winch,a bloody winch. Just let your imagination dwell on that ,Because we don't do spoilers,And Its much worse than you would assume.

The acting is very well done,The starring couple were great,Could have done with a love scene,But I digress.

The sheriff and deputy should have been continuing characters in other movies,Seriously LEE,A sheriff with a cadillac and a deputy whose wheel chair has a Gatling Gun...Cmon-These be Badazz !!!",1387152000,,717,4.884297520661157

THE TRUCK (2013) Horror, Mystery, Thriller

Cast: John Michael Morris, Rachelle Christine, Tim Emery, Andy Grace, Danny Lee Ramsey, Jenna Nichole Ruiz, and Lee Vervoort.

Written and Directed by: Lee Vervoort

Synopsis:

""In March of 1987, Roger and Alice take a weekend getaway to explore an abandoned campground Roger has inherited. Along the way, they run into an old four wheel drive truck that adds miles of terror to their trip. Is there anyone behind the wheel? Or is it driven by pure evil?""

Review:

Director Lee Vervoort brings to life a new and permanent staple in the Road Horror genre with THE TRUCK. A tale set during the eighties which serves as one hell of a high speed roller coaster ride that is constructed of a recipe for Terror.

Look for director Lee Vervoort's appearance in the film as Captain Leadfoot. A character that seems to be in his mind, the King of the road.

The movie contains some great actors that really make the film memorable. The male lead Roger, played by John Michael Morris, is a character that I can really relate with in that he is dealing with emotions from his past while at the same time feeling the current pressure from his girlfriend to ditch his dangerous occupation that he loves in order for the two of them to settle down and be married. Rachelle Christine does a wonderful job of portraying the role of Alice. Together the love birds display a magnetic and playful chemistry.

Tim Emery and Andy Grace, who both starred in Vervoort's first film GUN TOWN, return to create the law enforcement duo of Sheriff Jack Bishop (Emery), and Deputy Clarence Bishop (Grace) in hilarious fashion. These two fearless characters are not to be messed with as they are at each other's throats, delusional at times, and really deliver on the entertainment. The Lafayette County Sheriff's Department are aching to protect.

From the opening scene Vervoort holds nothing back as the tone is set with the notion that anything can happen in this movie. The pace of the film is not slow at all. It also contains many moments of amazing artistic approach. Proper care is used in taking the right amount of time to nail certain shots which are marvelous. From POV and low riding full throttle vehicle angles to lurking maniacal moments of fright. There is never a dull moment.

There is plenty of lightning fast action and edge of your seat stunts. It had to be very difficult to pull off some of the wild on-road as well as off-road scenes with the star automobiles. I really enjoyed the use of the older model bad ass vehicles.

With the year being set in 1987, it calls for a focused eye on attention to detail. THE TRUCK pulls through in a big way complete with filing cabinets, a red digital clock, and of course the radical eighties lingo.

The scope of the world in which we delve into here is fantastic and incredible to look at. You truly get the feeling that you are in the middle of nowhere. Many different set locations offer a variety of possibilities as the Terror begins to unfold.

The story is one that is very compelling with the focal point of the movie being THE TRUCK which mysteriously stalks and terrorizes methodically from beyond the shadows of the daylight. Danny Lee Ramsey, who makes a special appearance in the film, provides the incredible score. This ignites the Hellish evil of THE TRUCK with it's dark and wicked sounds launching us all into a nail biting atmosphere.

The ending of the movie you truly have to see this for yourself. I can tell you this, it does not disappoint at all.

In my eyes, fifty years from now people will ask the question ""what are the top three road Horror films of all time?"" In no particular order, I honestly believe that most diehard fans will reply ""DUEL, THE CAR, and THE TRUCK.""

I highly recommend this film to anyone reading this, especially those of us who love the world of Horror.",1385856000,,4017,4.633802816901408
8627313,4,B00GT5L3A6,"My wife and I really enjoy a good ""B movie"", and this definitely fits the bill. This is no Hollywood Blockbuster, so if that is your expectations, steer clear of this one. However, if you are a fan of 80's type B movie horror films, than buckle up for ""The Truck."" Because...""You can't out run it. You can't out drive it. You can not stop...The Truck.""",1493424000,,352,4.348484848484849

8627317,1,B00GT5L3A6,"A very high schoolish/amature attempt a cinematic thriller(?), totally fails in all areas , the only possible redeeming quality I could possibly bestow upon this film is that it did not cost a dollar more.",1440028800,,205,4.885714285714286
8627318,4,B00GT5L3A6,"For all past reviewers, there is one key component you are missing.  Instead of a Lincoln, we have a Blazer.  Instead of a gnarly horn, we have a miss in the engine.  Instead of James Brolin, we have 2 unknowns (but they did a good job, wink).  Missing are hallowed ground, a bicycle or two, a town full of people and pyrotechnics.  Added is a wheel chair and gatling gun.  Use your imagination.

With that said, I found this movie as one of my recommendations on Amazon, primarily because I own The Car (Rest in Hell, Antoine).  I don't want to give much more away, but if you are a fan of the aforementioned, this is right up your highway (pun intended).",1439251200,,656,4.319672131147541

8627321,4,B00GT5L3A6,"Who knew where Vervoort would take us next. Ever since the gloriously amusing and entertaining Gun Town, I have diligently been awaiting what would follow. The Truck is, as par usual, a fun ride but what stands out is that the director is starting to refine his craft even more and in this it shows.

As the story goes Roger and Alice are in their way to a campground as a weekend getaway when they encounter a truck that refuses to go and persists in tailing them, terrorising them. Who will make it out alive...?

The acting is extremely competent, at times you genuinely feel for the two main characters because the actors aren't hollow caricatures in particular Rachelle Christine is a joy to watch and an actress designed to go much further.

The cinematography is fantastic, the camera never jerks too much, the fluid motion works well and pops the colours that appear on screen when not the case the eerie way the truck slinks in shadows is done beautifully.

All effects, however few there are, look fantastic and reinforce why prosthetic is much better than CGI.

Just overall this is a fun, entertaining throw back to old school horror. You have some gorgeous cars, tidy neat acting, and a soundtrack that really defines what eerie means.

I love Tim Emery and Andy Grace whose fun touch has been missed.

Lee Vervoort is steadily becoming a director to keep an eye out for. I LOVED this film and eagerly await the next one to come. The Truck must and should be seen by every horror fan out there as this is what a horror film should be!

Excellently writtenly, superb cast, a glorious fun film that comes highly recommended by me.",1401235200,,1641,4.595890410958904
