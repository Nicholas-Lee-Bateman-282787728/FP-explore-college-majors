7664527,3,B01BNLB990,Marginal acting.... Plot is thin.,1466208000,,33,5.8
7664528,3,B01BNLB990,Fairly typical run of the mill gungho Marine movie that takes place somewhere in the Middle East a al Benghazi.  You've seen it before in a different place & time with different actors.  Wait for it to show up in Amazon Prime or Netflix before paying to see it.,1466035200,,261,4.3061224489795915
7664529,5,B01BNLB990,Can't really say how it compares to Jarhead 1 and 2 but this is good if you're looking for a good shoot em war movie.,1465948800,,117,3.72
7664530,4,B01BNLB990,"This film doesn't seem to be connected to the other two and I don't believe they even used the disparaging term ""Jarhead.""  Evan Albright (Charlie Weber) a lone wolf hero type, is assigned a gravy job at a US embassy in an unnamed Middle East country that has ISIS up north. In the first 30 minutes Albright (what's in a name) learns there is no ""I"" in team, the blond security agent (Sasha Jackson) that comes on to him, doesn't date marines; the ambassador (Stephen Hogan) doesn't have a personality; and his boss Gunny Raines (Scott Adkins) is a stickler to the chain of command. Albright believes an attack is imminent and no one believes him. At about 30 minutes into the film, it hits the fan and the gun fire doesn't let up until the end of the film.

This was a fairly formula film with limited unimportant twists. Dennis Haysbert plays a major in this film, a demotion from his normal general or colonel rank. The film takes time to let us know the characters before the over blown shoot out occurs. The film also tosses in some preachy lines of ""us vs them"" that were a bit corny, but has appeal to those attracted to this type of action film. Albright messes up in one scene and does his Richard Gere "" An Officer and a Gentleman "" breakdown impersonation, repeating much of the same lines... ""I got no where else to go.""  Groan. Seriously Chad? Those were the best lines you could come up with?

However looking beyond the film's short comings, it was a high action, heart pumping thriller with characters.

7664531,4,B01BNLB990,"Better than expected as far as the mounting tension, which is hard to do when you know where the story is going.",1472083200,,112,4.136363636363637
7664532,3,B01BNLB990,Much better than the second one in the series and the action and acting was decent but you will not see Scott Adkins unleash incredible arsenal of Kung Full moves on unsuspecting opponents,1471564800,,188,4.7272727272727275
7664533,5,B01BNLB990,"Good movie, I liked this more than J2 but nothing will be as good as the first. Worth watching for sure",1471478400,,103,3.9523809523809526

7664538,1,B01BNLB990,"Nothing worth to watch. If you were in military or know some tactics, you know nothing in this movie is true.",1468108800,,109,4.238095238095238

8750837,1,B01BNLB990,"Would it be too much to ask the actors to sound like Marines, look like Marines, carry themselves like Marines, and act like Marines? Really just turned me off to the movie.",1524441600,,173,4.4375
8750838,4,B01BNLB990,I don't know if I would say this was another in the series of Jarhead movies because it's really kind of stands on its own but as such movies go the Marines take name and kick ass. That's what they're supposed to do lots of shooting explosions whatnot. Fairly typical for the genre but entertaining nonetheless. Don't expect any deep insight into anything just enjoy it for what it is. Once the shooting starts it's almost continuous.,1497657600,,434,4.64935064935065

8750840,3,B01BNLB990,"This movie was really a 3.5.  I enjoyed it.  It fairly accurately depicts marines as those of us that love them and their traditions like to see.  It entertains you however a ""Gone with the Wind"" it is not.  The story was fairly good and the Arabic street scenes were so realistic.",1483315200,,281,4.346153846153846
