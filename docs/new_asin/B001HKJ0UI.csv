3630417,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I started doing The Firm workout in the 80's. I remember then you had to prepaid your order for the ""video"", in order for the company to produce it, since it had no finanical backing! I own all the classic Firm workouts. They are the best. I am so happy that they are now available on DVD format. Vol. 3, I find to be the most chalenging. The downside is that it contains a lot of high impact aerobics,which of course is now said to be hard on your joints. I usually adjust them to low impact, especially now since I am 30 years older since I first started! One frined told me that I looked ""Firmer""!  I was hooked!",1279065600,16,615,4.125
3630418,5,B001HKJ0UI,Love these old workouts.  I would love to find one of the newer firm DVD's that come close to the old ones.  - Still looking..,1269561600,12,126,4.0
3630419,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I bought the VHS of this years ago. When I joined the YMCA they were amazed at my stregnth and stamina. And it was all becauseof the Firm workouts. I like the classics and even Tortoise & Hare but after that, they seemed to become more about props and just another work out.",1267574400,6,274,4.188679245283019
3630420,5,B001HKJ0UI,"Results, results, results!!

Ignore the 80's style, cheesy music..and MAN..you will have that GREAT toned body in such a short time!!

DO NOT BE FOOLED!! This one is HARD, thourough, complete, and one of the BEST total body workouts EVER!! I have owned this one since I was 16--I am 30 years old now!! This workout NEVER gets old (besides our ever-changing styles of clothing and makeup)..this one is PERFECT!!

My ONLY complaint..is that the warmup/cool downs are TOO LONG.but I'm leaving my 5 stars because I simply fast forward the long warmup--and do my own. :)

Please, please invest in this workout...you won't be sorry. And the way you will see results won't leave you feeling dissapointed. I havn't ever seen one bad review on the Classics in ages. This is perfect for beginners, AND advanced. Infact, advanced exercisers never stop loving this video (such as myself). I wish more workouts would be made like this one..such fantastic and visable results..actually in LESS then 10 workouts!!

Simply a classic and a fortune for your body. :)",1266192000,40,1048,4.898305084745763

3630435,1,B001HKJ0UI,"According to reviews The Firm Volumes 1-3 many people highly recommended-I loved Volume 1,found Volume 2 to have awkward dancy moves while holding heavy weights-a recipe for frustration and injury and Volume 3 was so dated and silly that I was too embarrassed to be caught using it/after doing the entire workout once and hoping nobody saw me,it went to the way back of my DVD cabinet with all the other horrible workouts I felt duped unto buying-I often wonder who gives these awful workouts a positive review",1431820800,8,510,4.806818181818182

I felt like they were among the best exercise routines I had ever used, so I sought out others of the same vintage, but on DVD. I bought 4 and am very happy with all of them. Yes, the music and outfits are dated, but I feel much better; stronger and more flexible.

3630445,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I chose this rating because it is one of my favorite Firm workouts using free weights and aerobic training at the same time.  Sandahl really puts you through the ringer on this one.

I really love this one, it's one of my all time favorite, because Sandahl really puts you through a vigorous workout on this one.  She was trained by the late Anna Benson to lead this workout.  She does a fantastic job.  I was fortunate to have worked out with Anna and her sister Cynthia Benson, the co-creators of the Firm in Columbia, SC.  I have a duplicate copy of this workout, because I didn't realize it when I ordered it.  If you're interested, it's in the original packaging, unopened.  Just let me know.  Leave a message below.  you'll love this one for sure!

I would recommend this workout to anyone, just take it easy at first.  Build up slowly until you can do the workout easily.  Take your time and don't try to get ahead of yourself.",1397088000,10,934,4.423529411764706
3630446,5,B001HKJ0UI,"This hits all the spots and is challenging and fun. I have been working out consistently for many years and this has become one of my favorite resources. One word of caution: It is not recommended to pulse while stretching - this may cause strain. Therefore, I would recommend using the stretching portions of this routine only as a guide.",1390780800,5,339,4.666666666666667

3630448,5,B001HKJ0UI,"One of the FIRM classics-  and the first to introduce the ""tall"" box  (14 inch).  Sandahl is a good motivating instructor and the workout is tough.  Good cardio segments as well as some serious weight training.  My favorite part is the last segment with the active stretching.  Often times- the stretching segment is shortened so I love having some extra time to better my flexibility.

You'll need a tall box  (I use the FIRM FannyLifter), weights and an hour.  You won't regret it.",1383523200,5,483,4.72289156626506
3630449,5,B001HKJ0UI,This is a great workout.  Way better than the more recent FIRM workouts.  I always go back to this one.,1376352000,5,103,4.1

3630451,5,B001HKJ0UI,"My 2nd copy of this on VHS is holding strong! This is one of my favorite Firm workouts. It feels really long compared to Volume 1 and 2.. But there was always something about Sandahl Bergman's style of leading that I enjoyed. Volume 1 2 and this one are some of the best workouts to this day. I don't care if the outfits are terrible, the music is corny and when did gold chains while working out go out of style? Better tell that old guy at the gym. If you want to tone up fast this workout should be in your rotation.",1375315200,10,519,4.048543689320389

3630453,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I bought this when I was 28 and almost 30 years later I still love this video and so does my daughters.  People who want to lose weight always ask which video I do.  It is so wonderful because anyone can do it, you just change the amount of weight or don't do any weights just the movements.  It is an amazing full body workout!",1373155200,8,328,4.015384615384615
3630454,5,B001HKJ0UI,"After having my first child in 1992, I bought this DVD and did it pretty much every day.  I couldn't believe how fast I lost the baby weight.  Within 4 months, I was 5 pounds lighter than my pre pregnancy weight.  I have tried many videos over the years, but I still feel these original Firm videos are by far the best.",1361664000,15,319,4.112903225806452
3630455,5,B001HKJ0UI,"Best workouts on the market. So sad Gaiam bought them.  sandahl, Susan ,and Ali (cardio sculpt) are the best  . Better than Les Mills, better then any other DVD. I have been doing these for years . Highly recommend!",1354406400,13,215,4.487179487179487
3630456,5,B001HKJ0UI,"The Firm Volumes 1, 3, and 4 are, in my opinion, the most effective, enjoyable workouts available on video. If I could only own three video workouts, these timeless, well produced classics would be the ones. (Volume 2 has an instructor who I find annoying, and the later ones just aren't as enjoyable for me--the ones I've done have paled in comparison to these bright classics). When these videos first came out in the late 80s/early 90s, they cost $60-70 each on VHS, and people bought them en masse because they were just that darned good. Bergman is an excellent, professional instructor with impeccable timing. Like Susan Harris in Vols 1 and 4, Bergman is encouraging without being annoying. This workout has a steady pace, so the hour moves very quickly. The outfits were generally tastefully done at the time, but it was two decades ago, so it's dated in that way. I find the time passes even faster when I'm chuckling over these details, like men sporting deep U-neck pink tank tops tucked into belted spandex shorts. But unlike other videos of the era, these details aren't glaring because the workout itself is so top-notch, I find them a fun diversion while getting a great workout. But don't miss the guy in the back row sporting a mullet and another who's a Patrick Swayze circa 1987 wannabe.",1345161600,9,1306,4.732456140350878
3630457,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I LOVE this workout! I've had it since I was in my 20's (I'm 48 now) and I always enjoy this one! The upbeat music goes perfectly with the exercises! It is very challenging!!! You will need a sweat towel! Lots of butt & thigh work. Good old fashioned floor work! When your on the floor on your hands & knees she even has you hold a weight behind your knee as you do leg lifts which you have to squeeze to hold it there! She uses a TALL box - not for ""step aerobics"" but just to go up and down, and up and down - they describe it as the Fanny Firmer! LOL! Yep, I do believe they are right about that! Anyway I highly recommend this one! Slightly dancy due to her Broadway dance days, but she gives good cues and I think it's pretty easy to follow. Sandahl Bergman played in Conan the Barbarian (1982) with Arnold Schwarzenegger!",1342051200,10,827,4.111111111111111
3630458,5,B001HKJ0UI,"Yet another in the Firm Classic series, created by the genius Benson sisters.  If you're only familiar with the later, infomercial Firm workouts, find out what started it all (and discover a truly superior workout).  You could do this workout once a week for the rest of your life and it would never get old.  I've used weights ranging from 3 to 8 pounds...and weights ranging from 5 to 25 pounds.  The first to introduce interval style training.  Will sculpt your body and lift your rear to a true hourglass like no other workout.  Sandahl is a fabulous instructor:  motivating, fun and flirty.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.",1338422400,9,624,4.660550458715596
3630459,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I wasn't familiar with Sandahl Bergman until I watched her in the Upper Body workout with the other instructors.  Her style is intense, innovative, and do-able. She is also very graceful.  I want to move like her when I grow up.",1334275200,5,228,4.536585365853658

My sister came over yesterday to workout with me. She was laughing so hard at the music for the first 3 min. then we were sweating and dying! If you are serious buy this. I am also using the Firm Express and my body is changing fast. I have not weighed but i need to..and measure as well. Sandahl's cues are the best. the moves are slower and longer. I like that. I hate the flailing of other videos. This is a must if you r serious. Good luck, Julie",1321574400,11,599,4.084745762711864
3630461,5,B001HKJ0UI,"This workout will kick your butt!  I love Sandahl Bergman - she is flirty with the camera all the time killing you with one of the best workouts ever made. The first Firm videos (Vol 1-6) are all time greats.  This video introduces the tall step (renamed the Fanny Lifter - Ugh).

Anna Benson is now dead but she left a legacy of groundbreaking videos that have stood the test of time.

At some point ALL fitness videos will look and sound dated - but that should not detract from the quality of the workout.  This video is not for the faint of heart and it will  kick your butt!

I am an avid user of Cathe, owning most every workout post 1994, and the Classic Firm compliments Cathe's workouts so well.

Forget the JUNK that the Firm sells today - that is only a name with cheesy informercial junk equipment and cheesier instructors.

A few of the instructors (Kelsie Daniels, Allie Pointer, and Sue Mi Powell) were trained by Anna Benson.  I am ashamed to see how badly they have deteriorated.

But back to this video - get it and get a wonderful physique.  You won't be sorry.

RIP Anna - I hope some day you are nominated into the Fitness Hall of Fame.  You broke ground in the world of video workouts.",1310428800,37,1207,4.330357142857143
3630462,5,B001HKJ0UI,"I've learned more about how to handle weights and dumbbells with these FIRM training videos and DVDs than anywhere else. Technique is important to me and I think it has kept me from getting myself  hurt mishandling weights.

I'm not a lover of high-impact workouts, so in warm-ups, etc., I opt out of anything like jumping jacks, etc., and just keep moving my own way. This workout is tough, but even as a total novice with weight training, it wasn't overwhelming to me. I knew I wasn't going to be perfect the first time I did it, and I wasn't. It was a good workout.",1308268800,8,568,4.4
3630463,5,B001HKJ0UI,This is my go-to video when I want a serious workout.  Don't be fooled by the 1980's workout gear.  Sandhal Bergman leads this video and she is a professional dancer but she's tough.  She looks all innocent in the video except she's killing you the whole time.  This video is an interval workout where by cardio and weights are used (sometimes together).  Its a one-stop-shop for the whole body.  After this workout you will not need to do another workout one to supplement it.  Its all here and you will be dripping in sweat by the end.

8308816,5,B001HKJ0UI,"This is interval training, which means that there are three distinctive aerobic intervals.  The good news is that it's GREAT for your body to work this way. The bad news is that if you make it through interval two, it seems as if it's the workout is winding down, and you WILL want to quit!  It's a bit of design flaw with this video.  The instructor actually says the words ""Cool down"" after the second interval, so it's so tempting to just call it a day at that point.  But I'm urging you to push through and do the whole thing.  You will be glad that you did.  Interval three is going to kick your ass from here to next week.  There is no time off for good behavior in other words.  While some videos peak at around the halfway point and then ease up from the peak, this one saves the true ass whooping for the end.  You have to psych yourself up for it and know that the payoff will be well worth it.  The first two intervals are no easy walk in the park, though I assure you.  This whole video will leave you drenched in sweat and grinning like a lunatic by the end.  Start with no weights or  with very light weights until you get a feel for it.  I have been doing this madness for years, and I still don't add on the full weights that the instructor is suggesting.  I'm now 50 years old and still pressing those weights up as best as I can!  There are times when you will be looking at the screen and saying, ""Is she serious?""  You might even utter some expletives.  But again, it's all worth it.  Trust yourself and stay until the end of this workout.  The abs section is among my favorites.  One of the best workouts on the market today; and oldie but a goodie.
