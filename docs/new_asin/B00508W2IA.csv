I very angry with this dvd.
only 3 girls taking pictures at the beach.
I didn't feel confortable when I turnned on the dvd player and 3 girls appear, that were all.

4513665,4,B00508W2IA,"Thanks to Sony Pictures under the direction of few executive producers in bringing to the
home entertainment this 3-D experience. Swimsuits continue to influence fashion reflected
by top deisgners' collections. Not forgetting that Australia (Down Under) produces the top
swimsuits (including men's swimming-trunks) in the world, due to its climate.
Julie Henderson, Alyssa Miller & Irina Shayk are the three gorgeous streamlined and
minimal silhouttes with their soft and supple tone skin that embrace the 3D Blu-ray
""Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2011""; hence let us thank the producers for not using the
silicone babes; skeleton-like models and/or over-facelifted people that looking more like
lizards than like mammals, for modelling their swimsuits.
I reduce my rating by 1 Star as I did not appreciate seeing queer-hairdresser adjusting the
supermodel's hairdo or other photographers appearing during feature scenes of the film
instead being in the ""EXTRAS"" ; that's where the producer can show the viewers how the
film is being done; and also the 3D effects were average, I did not expect to see titties
coming out of the screen and hit me in the face, but at the same token the MAUI's exotic
sceneries could had been enhanced with more 3D spectacular effetcts.
Overall, my rating is 4 Star; even then, to all 3D Lovers, please get a copy of this
3D Blu-ray for upkeep at Amazon.com for your collection .",1311724800,2,1408,5.152838427947598
4513666,1,B00508W2IA,"I bought this at the store in a fit of enthusiasm about my new 3D TV, what a mistake.  I have fond memories of the swimsuit issue from my youth, so i thought I would give this a try and see if it is even better in 3D.  There was almost no content on the disk.  I think they looked at three models only.  The 3D does not add anything to this either.  PG only and very boring.",1311552000,32,374,3.7435897435897436

4513668,3,B00508W2IA,"This is a short video with 3 women, which I only really enjoyed watching the first model (the Russian model). I set up my PS3 to play 3-D movies and purchased this title. There is also a short video clip you can download for free from PSN to preview. I was highly impressed with the island of Oahu more than anything else. I purchased the download because I enjoyed watching the Russian model walking on the island from the free clip. This is also a movie I purchased because a couple of my guy friends wanted to watch. For me, this is not a film you want to watch with the guys. It's too slow and focuses more on questions asked to the models on getting the perfect photo shoot. This ""experience"" is more suited for a model to be. I would actually go as far to say that a woman would enjoy this more than a man.
3-D experience- B, the first model's natural curves showed well, as was definitely the highlight of the 3-D experience.
The island of Oahu was showcased nicely, although I wish there were more locations than the beach and the forest.
Models-everybody has different tastes on this. All of the models were attractive, but nobody is going to purchase a movie just to see attractive women. They are looking to see drop dead gorgeous women. I would put the first model into this category, but that's just my personal preference.
number of models- 3??, that's not a lot
Music-could have been better about average
dialogue- BORING! honestly, I don't care about the model getting the perfect shot. Most of us are probably never going to pose for Sports Illustrated.
Overall-a nice ""experience"" to watch with the wife or girlfriend. In my opinion, guys will get bored fast. Think of a Ms. America contest in 3-D. Women should have fun rating the personalities and attractiveness of the models.",1311379200,,1797,4.56656346749226
4513669,2,B00508W2IA,"If you are looking for a 3D Blu-ray showing models in bikinis, this is not the one.  The 3D seems to be a conversion and not native 3D.  If you are interested on this product, just get the regular (non-3D) version.  I got it to see how the sport illustrated models look in 3D but they look exactly as they will look in the non-3d version of the product.  To ensure I leave an objective feedback about this 3D product; here are two examples of very good 3D Blu-rays:  1.  Resident Evil: Afterlife [Blu-ray 3D] and 2. Step Up 3D.

4513679,3,B00508W2IA,"Like another reviewer stated, I too stayed away from this blu-ray because of the bad reviews, but recently bought one very cheap to check out. I was surprised I liked it as much as I did. This new format is the best because there is about 10 minutes of each girl on the beach or in nature. It's not as chopped up like all the previous S.I. swimsuit videos. It flows better, more serene. Only watched in 2D and the scenery and picture quality is gorgeous. Overall I gave this blu-ray 3 stars because 3 girls and only 30 min. running time is pathetic. People expect more for their money.

It appears S.I. has stopped making these swimsuit blu-rays/dvds. Too bad; if they had made this blu-ray using more girls and longer running time, it might have been more desirable for people to buy. I believe there is still an audience that appreciates an attractive girl surrounded by the beauty of nature that these videos could still appeal to, IF DONE RIGHT. As it stands, it is still an easy purchase for anyone who likes the 3 girls used. I just wouldn't pay alot for it.",1374364800,2,1064,4.428571428571429

4513681,5,B00508W2IA,"On a big screen you feel as if you are there with the models while the photos are being snapped.  And let 's face it that is as close as some of us will ever come to these gorgeous girls.  For some of us, this may be the only time you can actually take as long as you want to check out a beautiful women in a bathing suit without getting a dirty look.

Now I am not saying you should take this to a dark room for Great Movie entertainment, Aliens it is not; however you will be seeing some nice sized monsters on your 3D screen.  At least if the screen is ""Big Enough""?  Pun intended.

I actually bought this and other 3d content like it (for the sake of having a little more 3d content - I promise).  My wife normally will just shake her head at me and give me the ""Your so Lame look"".  Well this is the only bathing suit 3D material she didn't do that.  She actually stopped and said, No way Buster and took the disk.  Let me translate, These are extremely beautiful women from all around the world wearing bathing suits only old fat men wear down on South Beach Florida.  Teeny tiny bathing suits.  Yes in deed, did this blu ray disappear from my house that day.  LOL  My wife said she must have thrown it away accidently while cooking dinner and cleaning the house.

Yes I got the point and am still married; however, if your single and you want to see some of the hottest women in 3D (who do not cook you dinner, nor clean your house, nor love you).  Then this is the one you want to buy.

If your a married guy? I would have to advise against buying this one.  It will just be a waste of money.  Why you ask?  Because I guarantee you once your wife sees you watching it, you or the disk will be disappearing from your home.  You know, the one where your wife cooks and cleans for you because she loves you.  ;-)",1370563200,,1817,4.059154929577465
4513682,4,B00508W2IA,"It's great to see behind the scenes of a Swimsuit issue, and in 3D no less.

Only gripe (besides the length of the piece, I wish it was feature length) is the editing is quite poor and distracting. Unfortunately they have not released a 2012, or 2013 version. A shame because despite its short length at 30 mins it's still a great disc.",1367625600,,336,4.333333333333333

The picture is crisp, the Maui background is beautiful, and the camera shots do not change every second like previous years.  You got get amazing shots of the models, even from behind, and it's not bogged down by interviews.

4513686,5,B00508W2IA,"It's very important for me to write this review right now, because I am sure as I write this Sports Illustrated is in pre-production for the 2012 Swimsuit Edition Video.

PLEASE READ: Sports Illustrated, whatever you do, DO NOT stray from the format of this extraordinary video. The 2011 Swimsuit 3D Experience video is the perfect format! Regardless of what other viewers say, you did everything right with this video.

This masterpiece is perfect for guys who like to look at the most beautiful women in the world without any distractions. Mr. Whittaker's direction was considerate and focused; he made sure to make the production about the women, and not about fancy camera work. God bless you, man!

Past swimsuit videos had horrible direction. The cinematographer would never stay on a model long enough for the viewer to truly appreciate her beauty. Instead the camera work was riddled with unnecessary pans and distracting movements, in a cheap effort to make the video more entertaining...but only more entertaining to people who don't like to gaze at beautiful women.

For those who claim that the video is boring, I suggest that you just don't like looking at beautiful women. This is how to watch this video: play your favorite music, turn the volume on the video down, have a beer, and put the video on repeat.

I can watch Irina Shayk and Julie Henderson posing on that beach infinite times and not get bored! Wow...just WOW!!! Alyssa Miller is hot too, but she's more like ""wifey"" material (the type of perfect supermodel that you fantasize about marrying and having children with, which is a big complement.)

I need more Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 3D videos. Please take my advice into consideration and don't mess up the 2012 edition because of insecurity. Trust your manly instincts.

This is not a ""pop out at you"" 3d video for sure, but the vivid colors and high def image are enhanced with a depth of view that provides a more dynamic image.  This DVD is filmed in HI so every camera shot is full of tropical scenery.  I frequently describe my 3d TV as the difference between looking at a picture of a fish tank (2d), and looking into a real fish tank (3d).

4513690,5,B00508W2IA,"As many others, my family and I have recently been catching up into the 3D movie craze, so when our TV busted a couple of weeks ago (it was a horrible, horrible snowboarding accident), we decided to shell out the extra money for a 3D TV.

 Sadly, it seems that most of the 3D Blu-Rays are expensive. At the time being, we only had one (Avatar 3D, which came with our 3D Glasses), so when I found this on sale for $15, I knew I had something good, and I have to say that it far exceeded my expectations.

 I watched this late at night while my wife was asleep (I don't even think she knows I have it) and I never wanted it to end.

 They managed to pack such beautiful shots of the Hawaiian beach line in here!

 This is by far the best nature documentary I've seen, and the 3D helps. Everything works here, from the multiple colors of the trees, to the majestic view of the sand. I found it much more entertaining than Avatar, which I do have to admit, especially in scenes with the Na'vi Neytiri, the view was good, but this one takes the cake. I felt like I was actually in Hawaii!

 One downside is that some of the shots are ruined by what I believe are models of some kind. Sometimes they can be distracting and the camera focuses on them too long. I want to look at the tree and the water swaying, not the girl laying on her backside stretching on the beach! Sometimes they even break away from the scenery to have the models talk to the camera. It's alright at times, because some of them are interesting to hear them talk about their evaluation of the land itself, but other times you're just yelling ""GET BACK TO THE WATER!""

 But that's not enough to ruin it. You have to see it. 5/5, recommended for everyone.",1318032000,18,1720,4.210365853658536

8450966,1,B00508W2IA,"Wow.  For once I was looking forward to not having
to sit in front of my display to watch programming
that involved concentrating on a story or an Academy-award
winning performance.  For once, I could pop mindless entertainment
into my Blu-ray player, lean back and let my mind wander into
thoughts of.....baseball.

Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2011 brings us to the beautiful
island of Maui where we meet three of the magazine's most
smoldering supermodels: Julie Henderson, Alyssa Miller and
cover girl Irana Shayk.  Each of the models is given a 10 minute
segment where they all make a concerned effort to talk about how
great it is to model for Sports Illustrated.  We do get some insight
into how they began their modeling careers and the process of
getting themselves into character for the photographer.  Nobody
viewing this film is going to walk away with any valuable new
information, but then again, that's not why we watch these videos.

And you know what?  As much as I love watching stunningly
beautiful women strutting around in bikinis, I don't think that
alone, makes for great entertainment in a home theater environment.

The inclusion of 3D in this feature doesn't make it any more
intriguing, either.  Mostly, all the gorgeous Maui beach and
panorama come across as flat than ultra-dimensional. There's
one particular scene where is a model is posing against a
dead tree trunk on the beach that offers a nice sense of depth,
but foreground/background detachment is mostly minimal here.
There is nothing in the way of objects or models being played
for maximum 3D effect, so don't expect anything to spill out of
the screen.  Ghosting is non-esistent, even in the few scenes
where models are posing with little lighting.

While the high definition transfer is well done, I had a huge
problem with the way this feature was photographed.  In fact,
this was one of the few 3D titles where I actually experienced
eye strain.  There is a deliberate attempt to present the models
in foreground focus while everything in the background is blurred.
This wreaks havoc on the eyes as it constantly has to look for
objects to fixate upon (which you would think would come rather
easily in this case).  Additionally, because there seems to be
some intentional softening done with the photography, closeups
tend to look unfocused as well.

Most of the shots of the gorgeous Maui beach and tropical
backdrops are stunningly conveyed in this transfer along with
a well defined array of colors that include the rich greens of
the tropical forrest, the piercing golden sunsets across the
beach and the neon colored swimsuits that seem to have a
glow of their own.

One would not expect to pay attention to the music that
accompanies a feature such as this, but this 5.1 lossless
synthesized soundtrack is pretty difficult to ignore as it
envelopes the viewer, delivering a strong undertow of
LFE activity.  One would call it quite punchy and enveloping
at times.  The surrounds do a great job of delivering the
relaxing, ambient sounds of the Maui landscape.

The concept of swimsuit models in 3D is certainly
intriguing and I am certain will bait many into considering
a purchase. However, the novelty quickly wares off once
you realize there's very little substance here and the 3D
is mostly inadequate.

Seriously, you would be much better off buying the magazine
than spending $15 on this 30-minute infomercial for Sports
Illustrated.",1453075200,,3440,4.927209705372617
