7936431,5,B00005B1YE,I gave this a high rating because it was real footage of the Aleutian campaign during world war two. I had just read a book about the Aleutian campaign and was very interested in it. The other story was also well done.,1396742400,,218,4.214285714285714
7936432,5,B00005B1YE,I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  The DVD came quickly and looks new.  We haven't opened it yet because I haven't given it to him yet.,1323907200,,146,4.178571428571429
7936433,1,B00005B1YE,"I had high hopes for this video and ordered it as part of my research for a novel about the Aleutians war, and specifically the battle of Attu. I am hard of hearing and the sound quality is abysmal. Nor were there captions or subtitles and about all I could hear were vowels punctuated by an occasional consonant. The speaker sounded like he was announcing a horse race from the bottom of a deep metal vat, and there was very little footage that I found useful. Yes, I realize this was the technology of the time but captions would not have been that hard to understand. Nor was the second presentation that useful or even interesting. What has been of more use to me has been 1) Signal Corps photos and 2)  Reardon's novel, Castner's Cutthroats, about the Alaska scouts. Both of those get five stars.",1285459200,,801,4.486301369863014
7936434,3,B00005B1YE,"It's basically three shows on one disc; The Aleutians segment and the history of aircraft carriers parts 1 & 2.  I wasn't too impressed with the Aleutians segment.  It was all about the US bombing mission from Adak to Kiska.  They mentioned the island of Attu a couple times, but there was nothing about Massacre Bay or any other fighting there.  It should have been named ""Report from Adak"".  I bought it just for the Aleutians part since my grandfather was involved in the fighting there.  It's a good thing I have this in my collection:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-White-Black-Blue/dp/B001AZI1WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red White Black & Blue</a>",1282262400,3,703,5.776699029126213

7936436,4,B00005B1YE,"Director John Huston, while a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1943, creates an Academy Award winning documentary that he narrates with assistance from his actor father Walter, treating of the Armed Forces' successful effort to prevent the fall of the Aleutian Islands to advancing Japanese troops who had captured several islets. Although no claim can be reasonably made that this location was of major strategic importance during the War, it presented enormous tactical and logistic difficulty for those assigned there, and Huston's colour film demonstrates the determined ensemble work upon the outpost of Adak by a wide range of military specialists who combat loneliness and boredom along with notably severe weather conditions. The work was made over a six month period, and is climaxed by the preparations for, followed by an actual filming of, a bombing run over Japanese-occupied Kiska, wherein Huston nearly lost his life, and that is significant for its combat footage and for the atmosphere of suspense present in the viewer who wonders if all will return safely.",1113609600,11,1082,5.224137931034483
