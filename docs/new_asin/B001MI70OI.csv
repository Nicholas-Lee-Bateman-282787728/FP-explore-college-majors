If you are looking for detailed training information, get his book or an audiobook from your library or online!",1349049600,3,246,4.613636363636363

8321295,5,B001MI70OI,"As with all of Cesar Millan's books & TV shows, one of the best in teaching how to understand  & use dog psychology.
Contrary to the naysayers, he does not abuse dogs. What ppl see out of context of a complete episode, is not the whole picture.
He is dealing with dog psychology, not dog obedience/trick training.
When a dog is seen/heard yipping when he touches them to distract them from their obsessive/intense focus on something, is the same reaction & crying out a person would do if they are touched when they are intensely focused on something.  No physical abuse is done in either situation.",1457308800,3,599,4.6415094339622645

8321298,5,B001MI70OI,There are two major schools of thought today for dog training.  Treat them like a human child only using positive reinforcement and treat them like a dog as a dog would but with human love.  Milan is definitely the second and our family and four-year old pibull terrier mix have benefitted.  Two thumbs up recommendation to all.,1408579200,2,328,4.719298245614035
