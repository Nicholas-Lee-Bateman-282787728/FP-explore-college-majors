7856959,3,630394471X,"I am not really interested in psychics (believing that most or all are fake). But I really liked (and miss) the ""Sightings"" TV show, so I reluctantly bought this video. Even though I remember ""Sightings"" being of good quality, I was surprised at how much I liked this video. (For more on ""Sightings"" and other aspects of this video, read my reviews on ""Sightings: The UFO Report"" and ""...The Ghost Report"" videos.)

This video has a good, although brief, overview of the topic featuring: The history of psychic research, ESP, psychokinesis, precognition, psychic healers, psychic detectives, channeling the dead, mind over matter, and even seizure-alert dogs. Highlights include a woman who gained psychic abilities after being struck by lightning and actress Cindy Williams talking about how she was healed by a psychic healer. The host segment with Tim White features him in a house setting and then outside at night with fog rolling in the background (seems more fitting for the ghost video, but anyway...). The art on the video cover (or ""sleeve"") is eye-catching, as is the art on all three videos (my favorite artwork is on the ghost video - very cool). (The artwork on all three videos is also featured on some of the other merchandise from the show - see details below.)

The video has the same strengths and weaknesses as the other videos in this series: well-produced, but too short. It is entertaining, whether I believe these people have psychic abilities or not. Even though I prefer UFOs and ghosts, I would say that I enjoyed this one at least as much as the ghost video. Worth buying for ""Sightings"" fans and psychic believers.

*(For ""Sightings"" fans who are not aware, there was more merchandise based on the show: two books, T-shirts, wall hanging tapestries, and a CD-ROM (good luck finding that last one). Most of these can be bought on Amazon.com.)",1147651200,,1870,4.892744479495268
