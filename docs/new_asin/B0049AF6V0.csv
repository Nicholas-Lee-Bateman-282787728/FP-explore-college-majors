8418902,5,B0049AF6V0,Top value. Way better than the recent movie remake. Lots of fun action and good cliff-hangers. Almost as good as the first serial.,1379894400,,130,4.695652173913044
8418903,3,B0049AF6V0,"On my copy of this DVD edition the last three minutes of episode #8 was without sound. Don't know if it was just my copy, or if they are all like this.",1302307200,,151,3.75
8418904,1,B0049AF6V0,"Yeah, no. I actually found this at Best Buy for $5 and I don't know if it's even worth that. Trust me, I love the Green Hornet and these original serials but the quality is pretty much unacceptable. Low resolution video looks pixelated and down graded, audio is acceptable but its just a poor transfer as they're trying to cram all these episodes on one two sided disc. I hear the newly released 75th anniversary collections are nice...so maybe you should check those out.

All that being said, I'd rather watch this on constant loop than see Seth Rogan destroying GH one more time...so if you just want to do that...then please buy this.",1300579200,4,638,4.5964912280701755
