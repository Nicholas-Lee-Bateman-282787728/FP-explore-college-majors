224610,3,6300208818,"Based on a multi-million copy Harold Robbins best seller, NEVER LOVE A STRANGER is the story of a good kid gone bad.

Frankie Kane (Barrymore) is raised in a Catholic orphanage until his Hebrew ancestry is discovered. Teenaged Frankie runs away rather than transferring to a Jewish home-- thus begins his life of crime. Despite an initial refusal to accept his heritage, Kane becomes good friends with Jewish law student Martin Cabell (McQueen) and even closer to Martin's sister, Julie (Milan). This picture's weak script and production negate what was potentially a significant study of the effects of religious bias on nascent criminality.

224612,3,6300208818,Movie is average. Not as good as the book. The reviewer who gave it 4 stars was referring to another movie = LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER.,1352073600,,137,4.111111111111111
224613,3,6300208818,"Frankie Kane and Martin Cabell meet on the rough streets of New York and become unlikely friends. Orphaned since birth, Kane, played by John Drew Barrymore, is raised in a Catholic Orphanage. In one of his first film roles, Steve McQueen is gives a pleasant but understated performance as as Jewish Martin Cabell. It's a very strong push having Barrymore and Kane start the movie as teenagers. Barrymore obviously is well into his 20's in appearance but he is living in the orphanage trying to earn some extra bucks as a shoeshine boy. It is this job that leads him into the life of mob gangster Silk Fennelli.
Enter the beautiful and exotic Julie (Lita Milan) as the Cabell family maid and we have our love story between her and Frankie Kane. If this all sounds cliche, it is certainly is. It's not clear why Julie is a made other than her explaining ""there aren't many jobs for a girl like me?"" I assume she is Jewish like the Cabell family and this story touches the surface of anti-semitism during this era. Good Catholic boy Frankie Kane eventually learns that he has a devastating secret.
Cabell becomes an attorney and special investigator for the city of New York while Kane works his way up the ladder of the mob scene.
I had never seen John Drew Barrymore on screen and I can see what potential he had. We also see the potential in Steve McQueen who is the straight-laced attorney before the famous ""king of Cool"" kicked in.
I had never heard of Lita Milan. She had a brief and promising film career until she left acting to marry the son of the Dominican Republic's dictator, but that is another story and a movie in itself.
NEVER LOVE A STRANGER is basically disappointing in story and misses its potential. It is worth watching to see John Drew Barrymore, Steve McQueen and Lita Milan. The film combines the mob scene with a story of anti-semitism but neither seem to mesh together.",1344729600,,1895,4.576470588235294
224614,4,6300208818,"I received this movie the other day and was immediately disappointed on the quality of the dvd.  It really sucked.  It appeared to me that someone  copied this movie from Turner Classic movies and sold it as a DVD.  It was really terrible quality.

Overall I like the movie,  Both Steve and Natalie did a good job .  Too bad the DVD I bought sucked",1341014400,,348,4.2615384615384615
224615,3,6300208818,"Never Love a Stranger was produced by Harold Robbins and based on his debut novel (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Love-a-Stranger/dp/0671874926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Love a Stranger</a>). I recently read and enjoyed the novel. Set in the 1920s-1940s, it follows the life of Francis Kane, an orphan who grows up in an orphanage and becomes a head of the organized illegal gambling in New York. The movie is 90 minutes long and adapting a 380 page novel into a 90 minute movie is no easy task and much of the story needs to be trimmed down, but in this case they did far too much. Important parts of the story, including the one where Kane is adopted by his aunt and uncle only to have to leave them again, are missing in the movie, and almost none of the character development is left. The screen story seems unoriginal and a bit clichd, although the ending may come as a surprise.

As for the movie's qualities, the black and white photography is good and the actors do a great job. Seeing John Drew Barrymore's lead performance makes me wonder why he never became a bigger star. Steve McQueen is good as Francis childhood friend who later gets the job of trying to put him behind bars. Other good performances are those by Robert Bray and Salem Ludwig, and the female lead, Lita Milan, whom I didn't know of before.

To sum up the review, ""Never Love a Stranger"" is a bit of a disappointment as an adaptation of the novel. As a standalone work, it's not a bad movie, but also not a very good one. Recommended for fans of the actors or fans of gangster melodramas.",1258416000,6,1629,4.7935943060498225

It is two childhood friends who grow up and find themselve on opposite sides of the law.

Stars: 3

Pros:
-Steve McQueen in an early role
-Casting is decent

Cons:
-Tells you the outcome in the beginning (to me this is really hard to pull off, most of the time it just takes away the suprise)
-Execution of the story was a little boring

This movie was little more than ""ok"".  I wanted to know what happened, but I had little interest in the outcome.  Barrymore is an ok average actor, but Steve McQueen has a better screen presence.
