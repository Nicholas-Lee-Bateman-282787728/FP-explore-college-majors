8133787,3,B000GPPPPE,"This discusses the histories of China and Japan in 50 minutes, so you know this is just a quickie skim.
You can tell what the creators found interesting.  They focused on wars andd royalty.  Haikus, kabuki, geisha, and cultural forms barely come up.  For some reason, they mention 20-century Japanese leaders, but not Mao Tse-Dong during the Chineses segment.  They speak of foot-binding in Japan, but not in China.
This is a British production intended for a British audience.  All of the interviewees were white Brits.  There wasn't a single Asian interviewee here.  The martial arts examples were done by Westerners, rather than Asians.  At no point do you see anyone speaking in Chinese or Japanese and then a translater processing it in English.",1223424000,5,750,4.991935483870968
