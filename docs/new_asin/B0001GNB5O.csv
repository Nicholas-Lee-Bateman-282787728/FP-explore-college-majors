Dr. Hallowell is diagnosed with ADHD himself, and has 20 years of experience with ADHD children. The discussion is clear and informative. The interview is interspersed with real children and a session that Dr. Hallowell conducts with a parent. This DVD would be useful for parents, teachers and other professionals who want to know more about the current information about ADHD. Highly recommended.",1219622400,,493,5.175
