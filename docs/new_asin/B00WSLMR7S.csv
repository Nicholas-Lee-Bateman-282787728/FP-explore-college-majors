7152836,3,B00WSLMR7S,"This review is for 'Robot Overlords' released by Vertical in 2015

'Robot Overlords' is a science fiction film filmed in the United Kingdom in 2014.

PRODUCTION: Robot Overlords is a relatively low budget sci-fi movie filmed in Ireland and Wales. It's low budget only when compared to Hollywood big budget films. It had a budget of around 20 million dollars. It stars Gillian Anderson of X-Files fame and Ben Kingsley (known for too many movies to mention). The main star is Callan McAuliffe as Sean Flynn, the leader of the group of kids who resist the 'robot overlords.' In general, the movie was made for kids or young teens. Though it does have adult themes.

PLOT/SYNOPSIS:  The movie opens in a near future where humans are confined to their homes by a race of robots from outer space. They are not allowed out and if they try to go outside they will be eliminated if they don't return to their homes within 15 seconds. Supposedly this is only a temporary measure but we will soon find out this is not the case.  After messing with their neck implants, a group of kids discover that they can leave their homes and not be noticed by the robots. The robots use human collaborators to communicate with humans. These collaborators have special privileges and can go outside. The kids avoid these collaborators and eventually plot to overthrow the robot overlords.

There are many plot holes in this movie. But then again, there always is in movies made for kids. The DVD cover does not give you the impression that it's a kids movie (despite the fact that their are a few kids on it) but I guess it is really more of a teens movie than a kids movie. The behavior of both adults and kids is unrealistic in light of their plight. Both adults and kids appear to show a lack of serious concern of consequences at many points in the movie.

Overall, Robot Overlords is decent entertainment but that's all it is. There is nothing memorable about it nor would I bother watching it again in the future.

Recommended for people looking for some light hearted 'end of the world' entertainment. I would recommend seeing it as a rental.",1462320000,,2126,4.605820105820106

I had trouble believing some of the decisions people made, and all the pay-offs happened way too quickly. But even with all that, I kind of enjoyed this. The kids were all charming and interesting. I cared what happened to them. Gillian Anderson is wonderful as always. There's a great movie in here. I just think it falters some in the execution.",1457049600,,523,4.515789473684211

7152845,4,B00WSLMR7S,Frankly with a title like Robot Overlords I was expecting something really cheezy and just downright bad.  Fortunately I couldn't have been more wrong.  This was a solid film.  As the title suggests robots have invaded Earth and after an eleven day war humanity surrenders and succumbs to robot rule.  Human's are implanted with a tracking device and per curfew forced to stay indoors with those refusing being vaporized.  Four teens inadvertently discover how to disable their tracking device allowing them to go about undetected.  I enjoyed this film.  Acting was solid and special effects were good.  Sci-fi fans will likely find it interesting.,1447286400,,648,5.163461538461538

7152858,2,B00WSLMR7S,"Kind of a British YA Independence Day. The premise is pointlessly ridiculous and therefore never satisfactorily explained. The rest of the story is filched in bits and pieces from better sci-fi films, the plot holes vast, the budget visibly tiny, the CGI at a Brit tv level. Anderson looks and sounds awful and seems distracted, as though she thought she was making a different movie and is flummoxed to find herself in this one. Kingsley apparently will do any movie offered him, but at least he makes his scenes worth watching. My 2 stars are for him and the one cool effect, the small boy-robot.",1446854400,,598,4.704761904761905

It's not so much about the robots, but how humans have given up the fight, and few resist. Maybe a more quite, peaceful Terminator air to it.

Well worth a watch.

7152889,5,B00WSLMR7S,"We all love a great big robot with a throbbing piece (I meant a gun)and this film has them - by the bucket load - or is that `circuit board load? Set in the UK (actually filmed mostly in Northern Ireland) we have been invaded by huge robots - who just like politicians `never lie'. They are here to study all life forms and have imposed a curfew on all humans - except the Quisling types who actively collaborate - led by a sneeringly objectionable Ben Kingsley.
** Plot Spoiler a bit further down**
People are monitored by some sort of electronic tag that alerts the nasty machines if you do anything naughty and they come after you. Well if you are caught doing anything these robots don't like then you are sort of vaporised. Then the heroes - all kids - discover how to turn their tags off (like some of the crims we currently do this to). Then off they go on their plucky way to reunite families, start a resistance and save the world!

Is this any good though? Well no its utter rubbish and it knows it and that is why it is great fun. On the check list there are all the ingredients.
* An unambiguously evil enemy? -Check.
* Over the top performances straight out of Victorian melodrama? - Check.
* Some big names? - Check and double check - Gillian `X Files' Anderson is the mum!
* References to how great Britain used to be? -Check - even got a Spitfire!!
* Ludicrous stunts that defy death and gravity? - Completely Check!
* Pesky kids straight out of Scooby Doo? - Just keep those checks coming.

But as I said it does all this on purpose and so it is not only forgivable it is actually endearing, you can watch this with the kids, mind you they may say you need to watch something more adult. Also it is a perfect length at 90 minutes - for some good old fashioned sciency fictiony fun, then you can't go far wrong with this.",1440892800,3,1837,4.260744985673353

7152911,5,B00WSLMR7S,"Robot Overlords 5/5 stars After seeing the previews of this little indie I thought I would like it, as I'm a fan of kids-save-the-world apocalyptic movies. It's always great fun when kids that no one take seriously outsmart the adults/monsters/invaders and save the day, and this one delivered like a champ. Everything about this film is awesome, from the story (with one or two tiny blips*), direction, cinematography, locations, effects and, of course, acting. Ben Kingsley had the predictable bad guy role, but he made it his own and nailed it awesomely. At one point he's nearly drooling on Gillian Anderson's character whom he lusts after, and it all worked. Gillian is perfect as the mom holding her ragtag family together, with just the right mix of scared, smart, and defiant. The kids were perfect in their roles, from the one who ends up the hero to the little guy who was more than comic relief as I'd half-expected. Overall, very well done and worth seeing if this type of movie appeals to you. SPOILERS: . . . . .

* One part that caught me is when the kids take off, their mom doesn't know that their implants have been disabled, so wouldn't she have been insane with worry after they've been gone so long? Wouldn't she assume they were killed since the robots shoot after 15 seconds? So why is she so calm later when she's with the bad guy looking for the kids? * How did the kids know to take the battery with them? I just assumed that the implants were dead and would never reactivate. Little bit of knowing what they shouldn't there.
NOTE: The novelization of the movie fills in these missing plot points nicely.",1437350400,2,1630,4.601374570446735

8714086,3,B00WSLMR7S,"Not the greatest movie, the robot overlords aren't that badly done, they do look pretty good, except for the boy spokesman leader thing which is just a still photo (as a hologram) with a moving mouth.  Gillian Anderson isn't in this for much screen time, she does speak with a strong British accent which is kind of interesting.  Ben Kinglsey plays a character whose role sort of parallels occupied Europe cities during World War II, where some citizens became sort of snitches/betrayers for the occupying troops (robots in this movie's case) in return for favours (or maybe in their minds to avoid being killed) and are therefore given hall monitor type status and can walk around the streets visiting people's homes, (everyone else is confined to their homes and executed after 15 seconds if they don't return home).  So of course the kid characters don't like him and unlike their mother aren't smart enough to know you don't be openly hostile.  One kid is looking for his father (Anderson plays the mother) and the kid believes Kingsley just wants to get into his mother's pants, which is why Kingsley refuses to divulge what he knows about the father's whereabouts to them.

Robot Overlords is a kid character driven film.  When people are shot by robots with lasers they don't bleed or anything just go up in smoke.  It reminds me of many Saturday morning child character based Armageddon TV shows that were around in the 90s, where kids save the day by not following the rules and disobeying those who make the rules.  If you're a kid or are buying/renting it for your kid maybe give it a go, otherwise I wouldn't bother.",1469923200,,1628,4.72791519434629
