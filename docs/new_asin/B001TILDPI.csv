8341615,5,B001TILDPI,Wonderful documentary on Grace Hartigan!  Inspiring art and well produced.  Great balance between her art and her story!  Loved it!,1359504000,,131,5.45
8341616,5,B001TILDPI,"Grace Hartigan was a unique and talented artist in her own right who was best known for her Abstract Expressionist painting of the 1940's & 50's. She was one of only a few artists who managed to hang out at the rough and tumble Cedar Bar, the haunt of the era's most notable artists, De Kooning, Pollock and Rothko.

The movie admirably demonstrates that early period of American artists, hard living and drinking as well as how Grace was truly a contemporary of the period's best artists in every sense, despite the chauvinist environment. Clearly her work rivaled the better known artist of the time.",1241481600,2,602,4.733333333333333
8341617,5,B001TILDPI,"This is a powerful, nuanced film about an important woman artist, one who has left a vast legacy of work and students as testaments to her vision. Very well produced and tightly shot -- not to be missed!",1241395200,3,203,4.368421052631579
8341618,5,B001TILDPI,"This is a stimulating, fast paced portrait of one of America's (and certainly Baltimore's) most important artists.",1241395200,2,114,5.764705882352941
8341619,5,B001TILDPI,"This film tells the wonderful story of a brave young woman who was experimenting with a new form of art and engulfing herself in the richness of life. As is rarely the case, Grace Hartigan was recognized during her lifetime for her growing body of work. She was a true trailblazer, both of abstract art, and of women artists. This is not just a story of one artist, but of the richness of a life in art. Highly recommended.",1241395200,,423,4.367088607594937

It is a truly compelling story about a magnificent artist and a strong-willed human being; women will admire her strength and courage.  I applaud the makers of this film for bringing it to life in a meaningful way.",1241395200,,272,4.666666666666667
8341622,5,B001TILDPI,"What a pleasure to view this scholarly and visually entertaining film about the life and work of  expressionist painter Grace Hartigan!  The film follows her work as it is reflected in the inner and outer changes in her personal life, weaving through a period of many decades. In addition to her body of work itself, the viewer enjoys the visual journey back through this period in the history of modern painting.

I heartily recommend it.
