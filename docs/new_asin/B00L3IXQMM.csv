8663575,5,B00L3IXQMM,"My younger child (3) is sporty, and loves her kid yoga DVDs, but they are too much for my older child, who has minor gross motor delays. These are the DVDs they both do together, the ones that get both of them moving, with simple instructions, simple movements.

As an adult, they're a bit annoying to listen to, and there's one action in the first DVD that requires my presence (so they can leap over my legs) but these are things I can live with if it means both kids getting a bit of exercise.

The older child is starting to lose interest, at 6 I think he's ageing out of them, but they've done us well for a couple of years.",1459641600,2,629,4.147540983606557
