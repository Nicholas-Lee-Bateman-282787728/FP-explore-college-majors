5933204,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I bought this at Target last week... no idea why, I've tried other Tracy Anderson workout DVDs and have not liked one of them. She gives no instructions. If you've read other reviews on Tracy Anderson I'm sure you've heard that it's like watching a teenage girl dance in front of a mirror (which is entirely true). If you like her other DVDs you will probably like this one.",1381276800,2,374,4.434782608695652
5933205,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I normally prefer to do one of Tracy's mini-trampoline cardio workouts, since i have two left feet and one bad knee; but I really enjoyed the slower pace and lower impact of the two workouts on this DVD. If you're familiar with Tracy's DVDs, Dance + Cardio feels like an updated and improved version of the dance cardio from Tracy's 30 Day Method Book DVD. If you're not familiar with Tracy's DVDs, then you should know that this is not the type of dance workout where Tracy teaches you a complicated Dance routine. You'll find that type of instruction on her DVD Method: Dance Cardio Workout.  Although the Cardio+Dance workouts do not have any cueing/instructions, the workouts on this DVD are more cardio than dance.  They're simple, repetitive combinations that are easy to learn as you follow along.  Workout 1 has a slightly slower pace and less high impact jumping/moves than Workout 2; but Workout 2 is still much slower and lower impact than Tracy's Metamorphosis Dance Cardio, which makes my knee happy.  It's true.  The music on this DVD, sucks (as usual) but I prefer to change the music I listen to while working out daily anyway.",1381104000,9,1143,4.752525252525253
5933206,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I am so happy with this product from Tracy Anderson. I do love Tracy's toning DVD's, but struggled greatly with the cardio due to being prone to knee injury or shin splints. This one provides me the cardio from Tracy that I love, but at my beginner's fitness level, and because there is not too much jumping, I am able to do most of the DVD as is and work up a great sweat, burn calories. I greatly enjoy the types movements Tracy does. I find my body responds well, and they just feel good both during and after the workout. Tracy's style is different which is what I love about it (and to each their own to find what works best for them to keep healthy and fit). There is no cueing, and it may seem challenging to pick up the moves at first, but truly once I shifted my mindset to understand, this is doable, it just takes a little time to learn, then I was able to enjoy the process and gain the benefits of her method. This is great for beginners to intermediate level, or perhaps for someone who is advanced but needs a lighter workout once in  a while to mix things up. I don't do any jumping, so I occasionally modify to moves to ensure this. On the flip side, if someone wanted to increase the intensity, it would be easy to modify the moves to make them bouncier.",1380931200,6,1272,4.191836734693878
5933207,1,B00EPH8SFS,This workout video completely lacked direction and almost felt sporadic.  I almost felt like I was trying to follow a teenage girl dancing in her bedroom.  I like to get a little direction and feel like I can really get into the moves...by the time I followed one move she was on to the next.  I don't recommend this video.,1380844800,4,323,4.35
5933208,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I bought the DVD at Target and I think it is a lot of fun.  I like that she doesn't give instructions, I find it challenging enough to keep me interested but not so challenging I can't do it.  I have looked at her other dance DVD's and they are way out of my league, but this is good for people like myself who are not dancers but have enough coordination to follow along and have fun.  If you need a lot of instruction and guidance I don't recommend it.",1380758400,21,454,4.022222222222222
5933209,1,B00EPH8SFS,"I purchased this product at Target last night and was excited to get home and use it.  I have numerous dance and cardio DVDs but none from Tracy Anderson.  The music was ridiculous, she was not with the beat for the better part of the segment and was completely improvising during her moves.  Without any verbal instruction, it was difficult to figure out what she was doing without keeping your eyes on the TV screen the entire time. I would equate it to someone jumping around in their living room, doing moves that are far from dancing and having someone film it. The worst exercise video I have ever purchased!  If I could return it, I would.  I bought another one of her workouts and fortunately I did not open that one, so I will be able to return it.",1380672000,7,757,4.378571428571429
5933210,2,B00EPH8SFS,I purchased at Target. I was looking for a new alternative to Jillian just to have more variety. I love to dance so thought maybe this would be good.  The music is so bad that I cannot even get into doing the moves.  I realize using current music dates the product but really it needs a better beat. I was getting a sweat going but I was so bored the entire time.  Could be great but the music has got to keep you motivated. This does not.  This was my first time purchasing a Tracy Anderson DVD and probably my last.,1380585600,2,517,4.089108910891089
5933211,5,B00EPH8SFS,I also picked this up at target today and love it. Im not too much into the music but the workout is great. I will be doing the second cardio in the morning before work.,1380585600,,169,3.857142857142857
5933212,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I have most of Tracy Anderson's DVDs and have to say that this is a good dance cardio DVD for beginner to intermediate (even advanced) exercisers.  There are two workouts that are 30 mins each.  The first one is a bit easier than the second one.  I would say that you can sub this cardio in for the meta cardio or add it to the mat workout, beginner workout, or precision toning for your cardio.  The music is not the same as the Meta workouts which is a great relief as that music is used on many of her other DVDs.  The workouts include a warm-up and a cool down.  The first workout doesn't have as much jumping but there is enough movement to really work up a sweat.  The second workout has more jumping and reminds me more of the meta cardio.  Either way they are both good cardio workouts.

On another note Amazon says this will be released December 3rd, but I purchased it at my local Target for $12.99.

EDIT: I wanted to add that if you are not familiar with Tracy's workouts they are very different from Jillian Michaels, Insanity, The Firm, etc.  If you are looking to find a similar workout I would suggest passing on this.  If you are looking for an introduction to her method this would be a good DVD for the cardio but I would also suggest the Beginner Method DVD, or her book.",1380412800,19,1291,4.267489711934156
5933213,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I bought two Tracy Anderson DVDs at Target and they couldn't be more different. I really like the Cardio Dance for Beginners one, but this one had absolutely no instruction or routine. It's pretty much 30 minutes of warm ups. The ""beginner"" one is a much better work out, has better routines and actually has instruction. If you're looking to buy a workout video, there are much better options than this one.",1457481600,,408,4.680555555555555
5933214,3,B00EPH8SFS,"I love Zumba and, like other reviewers, I was disappointed about the choreography.  It's clear Tracy wanted to keep it simple, which I would be okay with, but I she should have kept the same counts for each move consistent.  She seemed liked she was just  ""winging it"" the entire time.  I do love that this video gets your heart rate up and I do sweat from this short workout.  It's effective, but I'm only giving 3 stars because of the poor choreography.  I don't use the DVD often, instead opt to go to my gym for Zumba, because it's not fun. I've gone to many beginners Zumba classes and it's easy to make simple dance moves fun. That is what I was expecting from this DVD.",1456617600,,676,4.283464566929134
5933215,1,B00EPH8SFS,Too boring and repetive. Do not buy!!,1456099200,,37,4.428571428571429
5933216,5,B00EPH8SFS,This was exactly what I was expecting it to be. I own most of her videos and even her book.  I really love the TA method.  I can see such a difference in my body.  Not as much jumping as other videos I own of hers.,1455494400,,214,3.608695652173913

5933218,5,B00EPH8SFS,"If your like me overweight and beginning to exercise , then this will work for you . I love that she's not talking and talking because I feel I don't get bored with this workout . I personally don't like  instructors  that talk so much it gets annoying . So I love Tracy and her cardio DVDs .",1451174400,,292,4.017241379310345
5933219,2,B00EPH8SFS,"This was pretty boring and mostly involved a certain amount of hoping around. But if you want to just turn your brain off and move, its probably an excellent fit! Sometimes you just need to just need something easy and carefree to get you going, and I think it accomplishes that.",1449187200,,279,4.490196078431373
5933220,2,B00EPH8SFS,"Once again her DVDs manage to be devoid of any since of rhythm or music awareness. If you're a dancer or musician, this will kill you.",1448841600,,134,4.1923076923076925
5933221,3,B00EPH8SFS,"I rated this dvd 3 stars, 2 for making you sweat and actually working to up cardio endurance if done daily and 1 for showing visible results in as little as 1 month.  A few things though... she does mention that this work out dvd is for non-dancers or dancers who are just trying to up their cardio so in all fairness the utter redundancy you'll experience she does mention will be there, and boy is it THERE.  If you like a dance workout with variety then this is NOT the one.  Another thing that gets to me as a former dancer is the music.  There are times where the music and the rhythm of the movements don't sync up and as a dancer that drives me crazy... and the music just plain... well it sucks.  In short, it's a lot of hopping around, box steps and grape vines and at times feels like line dancing with a bunch of jumping thrown in. That being said, f you're doing this at home on a carpeted surface bare-foot it gets annoying since if you're not careful it feels like you may twist an ankle when she does some quick turns.  On wood or some other hard surface with sneakers on I'm sure it would feel better.  One big plus is she doesn't yap your ear off while working out but you do have to watch her carefully for cues as to what she plans to do next and expect to spend the first week just trying to get the order of the workout down.  After doing it for approx. 6 months... the redundancy has gotten to me ( like I said I am a dancer and like true combinations/variety) and I have stopped using it daily.  I have it stashed in the back for a rotation in the future when the boredom wears off or I feel I really need a cardio boost.",1444953600,,1644,4.080745341614906
5933222,1,B00EPH8SFS,"It's not cardio and it's not dance. It's just Tracy Anderson, not talking and not smiling, doing awkward movements for an hour. Avoid!",1439942400,,134,4.869565217391305
5933233,5,B00EPH8SFS,"i bought this video to use as an alternative to running... cardio can become tedious and boring and i lose motivation pretty quickly if i'm just jogging on the treadmill. i also go to a university and the gym there is always crowded and running outside is sketchy (haha). i love this video because it does get me sweating and by the end of the 30 minutes i feel like i've gotten a good workout in, plus it's convenient enough that i can do it in my apartment. sometimes i'll do both videos but not often. the music does get old fast, but i've learned that the dance moves are pretty basic, so sometimes i'll turn on my own music instead and it doesn't throw me off.",1439942400,,665,4.244094488188976
5933234,5,B00EPH8SFS,"When I first watched this prior to doing it I thought this is not for me.
Darn, wasted $. Just wanted a video to raise my heart rate. No floor work.

Then finally tried it.
After 30 min. Sweat pouring, clothes wet, HR elevated.
I felt great!

Accept the learning curve and keep moving along best you can.",1435795200,,304,4.224137931034483
5933235,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I actually really like this DVD. I love Tracy Anderson and I'm finding she is very love her or hate her for most people and that's ok. I use this DVD as a replacement for the metamorphosis program cardio DVD which was becoming way to high impact for me. This DVD has more repetition with the specific moves and a semi slower pace. It's very light on the jumping. This DVD like all of hers are not meant to be quick fixes and instant gratification. They're supposed to be studied, learned and repeated. I got the choreography down in 4 viewings and I'm no dancer. If you are considering doing her method I would strongly suggest YouTubeing her workouts to make sure it is your thing before purchasing.",1434844800,4,700,4.4765625
5933236,5,B00EPH8SFS,"As always-Tracy is totally amazing and so creative. I have so much fun doing her cardio routines! It's like dancing, but you are also jumping around for 30 min straight. You can't help but burn a ton of calories!",1434758400,,212,4.461538461538462
5933237,3,B00EPH8SFS,It's ok. She talked through too much of the moves. I like her other DVDs better.,1434412800,,80,4.0625
5933238,3,B00EPH8SFS,"I think that this Dance+Cardio DVD was originally meant to be paired with Precision Toning but, compared to that muscular structure work, it's too easy. This is a beginner level Cardio: the second coreography it's a little bit more difficult than the first one but they're both incredibly simple for those who have already tried other cardio DVDs from Tracy. I would suggest the purchase only to those people who have problem of coordination with the moves: in this case the DVD would be very helping to get closer to the world of dance aerobics.",1429142400,2,546,4.757894736842105
5933239,1,B00EPH8SFS,This video is like an SNL skit. The moves are not for the general population. It is not even garage sale worthy.,1428969600,,112,4.136363636363637
5933240,1,B00EPH8SFS,"As others have said, Tracy gives NO instruction at all. She does speak (initially) for a few minutes then, without even a hint of ""let's begin"" she just starts doing some dance moves. Then some more. Almost like she's just making it up on the spot. I kept waiting for a word, a peep, even a ""you're doing great!"", but nothing. She just kind of stares hypnotically into the camera while dancing as if she is sending me a mental message of ""you sucker...you paid $9.99 for this at Target....bwa ha ha.""  I gave up and went back to Jillian Michaels who, although some times barks like a drill sargeant will atleast tell me what to do.",1428278400,,631,4.3931623931623935
5933241,5,B00EPH8SFS,"This was a fun video for me. There is no instruction on the moves, but if you copy what shes doing and stick with it its easy to learn. It burns calories and its just a good time, jumping and dancing around. The only thing i didn't get was in cardio dance 1 she randomly looks in front of her and laughs at someone. Idk if its a friend or students? But it makes it kinda awkward. I have 5 of Tracys videos now and they all have been effective in helping my weight loss goals. 40 pounds and 4 dress sizes. She DOES. deliver results!",1426723200,2,531,4.018867924528302
5933242,4,B00EPH8SFS,"FIrst, I know little if anything about Ms. Anderson, save the accolades I have read by so-called famous people while perusing trashy articles.  So, I got the DVD at Target because I have put on a lot of weight and need to lose about 30 pounds (yikes!), and since this was a cardio workout, I thought I could get quicker results.  In watching the video and following along, I agree that there is no instruction, but like one of the commentators wrote, who needs an instructor to tell you every step. Her formula is something that is not very complicated (and dare I say, a little Tae Bo-esque at times), so it is NOT hard to follow along. I really don't think most adults NEED an instructor to tell them what to do step-by-step.  If you do, go to a class...I mean really!  Third, I agree that the music sucks, but thanks to my hubby, I have my Dr. Dre Beats wireless headphones and I just jam to that, while watching her ""moves"".  I get a good workout/sweat, and like another commentator, I did feel the burn the next day.  I am only on my 2nd day with it, but I am going to give it a real good try.  Hopefully, I can comment again and write ""I lost 30 pounds with Tracy""!",1426550400,,1171,4.2242152466367715
5933243,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I'm a Tracy Anderson fan and have 4 of her DVDs. This one is bizarre. She doesn't speak, there's no instruction or counting to know how many reps of s move to do or what's coming next. I feel like I paid to watch her dance around... In silence.",1425427200,2,244,4.0
5933244,1,B00EPH8SFS,"The pace doesn't seem to flow with the music and she doesn't say one word the entire time so I'm finding it difficult to follow. Plus her pace is quite fast for a beginner. Don't think I like it. Also her arm movements are really inconsistent, I would think for the best results you'd want uniformity.",1424908800,,301,4.392857142857143
5933245,1,B00EPH8SFS,I really wish I could give this zero stars.  I know she is a highly acclaimed trainer and works with celebrities but her method is just not for me.  This workout is truly a joke and a waste of money.  I don't know even where to start with this - her quirky moves - no choreography or instruction from her to the music (if you want to call it that) that isn't motivating at all.  I could have saved $12.99 put on some music and just danced around on my own for 30 minutes because that is all she does.  My advice is to save your money.  Leslie Sansone has two very good dance type workout routines with good music and instruction and better moves.,1424390400,,646,4.128

5933247,1,B00EPH8SFS,"I have done all types of exercise for years, and have a number of workout videos that I use regularly.  Looking for a little variety, I picked up this Tracy Anderson Dance + Cardio DVD in Costco.  It is a mindless series of wiggles and simple steps set to a numbing, non-musical percussion and Tracy appears to be making up the moves as she goes along.  After a few introductory words, she does not say another word for the entire ""workout"".  If that's all that's required to make an exercise video, I should have been doing it for years!

In line in the cafeteria, walking to math, waiting for her mom to pick her up for hip hop class. I don't mind so much there being no instruction in the video, but a heads up would be nice. Like, ""I'm only going to do this for seven counts!"" Or, ""JUST FREESTYLE!"" And for the love of Pete, it's hard to take someone seriously when she is wearing pants that say ""I LOVE TRACY.""

5933249,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I do a lot of workout videos, but I was not a big fan of this one.  The lack of verbal instruction is very confusing.  This might be alright if the moves were predictable, but there are unexpected variations that throw you off.  The lack of cues also means there are no suggestions given as to technique - if I didn't know technique from other videos/classes, I wouldn't know the proper (and safe!) way to do many exercises.  I like to throw it in for a quick workout when I can't go for a jog, but wouldn't recommend it to purchase.",1421884800,,533,4.247524752475248
5933250,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I just bought this DVD and did the 30 min routine for the first time. Here are my thoughts:

Cons:
-There is no verbal instruction or warm up really. She just starts dancing with zero indication of what she's going to do next. It's kind of difficult when you don't know whats coming.
-You can tell the music was added later because there are many times she is not moving with the beat...frustrating.
-Speaking of the music, it is AWFUL! Makes it really hard to get enthusiastic about the workout.
-As someone who is a terrible dancer, I found myself getting lost.

Pros:
- I sweat a lot so I assume it was a decent cardio workout.

In conclusion, I cant complain TOO much because I did get a decent workout but I wouldn't buy this DVD again.",1421193600,,741,4.355072463768116
5933251,2,B00EPH8SFS,"This is my first review. I just completed the first 30 minute routine.  Was disappointed.  While it is strange that there was no instruction, this didn't bother me.  I have taught fitness classes and pickup on moves quick. Not a very exciting workout and no energy / excitement from the instructor I would not recommend for beginners or people new to dance workouts.  Some of her moves seemed to demonstrate bad form.  My biggest problem with the dvd was how disjointed it seemed.  Didn't like the music and Tracey was not on beat to the music...very odd.  I will try the second routine, but not getting hopes up.  Also, there is an odd start to video and no cool down or stretch.",1420588800,,680,4.516393442622951
5933252,1,B00EPH8SFS,"I bought this at a local Target on a whim - what a waste of ten bucks! There is no verbal instruction as she goes through the moves and she transitions through them quickly before you have a chance to figure out what she's doing. The first video has a step touch thing she does in different directions that I probably won't be able to figure out without putting the video on slow-mo if I could.

At some point I just gave up trying to keep up with her. This is NOT A WORKOUT DVD. I expected some background dancers at least to create a more fun atmosphere but it looks like they went as low budget as they could go on this. This is more like watching someone else dance quickly for a half an hour and trying to copy them. You're better off putting on your own music of choice and dancing freestyle if the whole point of the DVD is to get you moving.

Bottom line, save your money.",1417910400,2,880,4.1104651162790695

The music is nothing special so if you need something to pump you up put it on mute and throw on your own mix. I  The moves are repeated over and over so if you keep at it you'll eventually catch on. By the second day I was a lot more coordinated. One reviewer said she did a jump whenever Tracy does a turn.

5933271,1,B00EPH8SFS,I'm not sure but I think this is her very first video. Terrible. It's almost like she was making up the steps as she went along. I wish I can give it negative stars.,1406073600,,165,3.8823529411764706
5933272,5,B00EPH8SFS,I am just happy that I don't have to rearrange my furniture for this workout DVD! Her two previous dance cardio dvds are awesome but I constantly had to move my couch! This one is still effective and fun without the hastle!,1405814400,6,223,4.333333333333333
5933283,5,B00EPH8SFS,"So I started TAM a few months ago and avoided the cardio for a bit because of reading so many negative reviews.  I decided I needed to give it a shot because bossy Tracy says you have to do the muscular structure work AND the cardio, so this is the video I started with.

As far as the negative reviews, I don't get them at all.  No instruction? All of her workouts are intended to be done lots of times, you LEARN the routine.  Misstep? So what? You can easily get caught up with her, just watch and learn.  After doing the first workout maybe 10 times, I practically have it memorized.  Don't like the music?  Bust out your iPod, it's not like she's talking to you during the routine.  Any shortcomings of Tracy's are really not a big deal when you consider the excellence of the content and the results that come from the TAM.

When I first started the dance cardio, it was really difficult for me.  Though I can get through 1 & 2 of Perfect Design Series with no problems, it became obvious that my cardio endurance was lacking.  I love that with Tracy, you are doing the same routine several times in a row, so you can very quickly tell that your body is becoming stronger.

If it starts getting too easy, get yourself some wrist and ankle weights.  I use 1.5 lb wrist weights and 2.5 lb ankle weights (for a total of 8 lbs), and it makes the workouts much more challenging.

I work out in front of a mirror, that really helps me get the steps down.

All in all, I totally love this workout.  It's fun!!!  The TAM is giving me fantastic results in my arms and abs, way better than I ever got from Jillian.",1404777600,3,1610,4.226229508196721
5933284,3,B00EPH8SFS,"first, just so you understand, i don't really like Tracy. As a person. So let's just get that out of the way.

PROS
the workout is good. right now I do the Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred. I love it, but because i go through patches of watching 90's television on hulu instead of working out, i have yet to get past level 1.
I got a little bored of it so I tried this.
It's catchy. I didn't think it was working at first, until i tried it again the next day and realized how sore some of my muscles that I guess I don't normally use are. I think it's a good workout to rotate with the 30-day shred. You catch on quickly to what she's doing. the moves aren't hard. Anyone can do them. and it seems to be over quickly. I like that!

CONS
My main issue is Tracy
1) she gives no instructions. At all. You just follow what she does
2) the music is bad house music.
3) her pants say ""i (heart) Tracy"". Seriously
4) she needs a bobby pin or headband or something. moves her bangs every 30 seconds. If i did the same thing, and did the workout daily, after a month my left arm would be a lot toner than the right. That's how often she does it. It's practically part of the workout
5) i don't know how to describe this part. She just doesn't seem to know what to do with her face. It seems she looks off camera and someone reminds her to smile. Then she gives this awkward, almost attempting seductive grin to the camera. It's weird. I know that isn't a reason to dis-like a video...but she does it a LOT. Each time she does it I want to look away.

other than those weird things, it's great. I know it sounds like I'm being super critical. And I am. But you have to understand, I have no complaints about 30 day shred. Even when Jillian is being patronizing. I just take it. The fact that these things all leapt out at me the first time i did the video shows how glaring the issues are.
If you can over look those things, then go for it!",1401148800,7,1928,4.041884816753926
5933285,2,B00EPH8SFS,"Okay, I should start by saying that I am a Tracy Anderson fan. I like many of her workouts. I was hoping to mix things up a bit with this one, but honestly, unless you are prepared to spend tedious hours learning these routines before you actually have the benefit of actually using it as a workout, this probably is not the workout dvd for you. I gave it a good try and don't consider myself to be an uncoordinated person, but I just didn't have the patience or time to make this work for me. The idea is to learn the dance moves slowly elsewhere on the dvd, then put it to use real time in a pretty fast-paced routine as Tracy dances along with you on the screen, saying nothing. It ended up just being pretty frustrating. I went through the first instructional dance a couple of times before deciding that I didn't have the patience for it.",1400630400,2,843,4.275
5933286,4,B00EPH8SFS,I love Tracy Anderson workouts and this video finally doesn't dissapoint like her other DVDs where they edited so poorly.  This one is clearly produced better and the dance sequence is not interrupted by editing.  It is 2 continuous 30 minute dance sequences.  I like it because it's not too difficult to follow and there isn't much talking (just at the beginning).  Tracy's dance method makes you feel good about yourself without feeling like giving up.  In my opinion it is not too difficult to follow.  It might take a bit to get used to if you do not have any previous dance experience.  It's a great workout for those who enjoy dancing!,1400630400,5,641,4.619469026548672
5933287,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I'll be honest, I didn't get through this workout even 1 time - there are absolutely no verbal instructions given.  It's Tracy doing the dance routine, and you have to learn the workout on your own - and until you learn it, you will always be a step or so behind because she moves to new dance moves with no warning.  Some may like this, but it's not for people who want to exercise without having to waste several workouts just trying to anticipate what's coming next.  I tried it for about 5 minutes and could tell I would not be working up a sweat at all until I learned all the moves - who has time for that?",1398643200,,612,4.126050420168068

I get a great Cardio workout without all crazy jumpn, plus I can modify it to make it even more intense by addn jumpn if needed. I actually like the music & able to do the whole 30 min with no problem & get pretty sweaty. And haven't even tried the 2nd dance cardio on the dvd. Overall, it gives a good cardio workout :) and its fun.",1398470400,,473,3.9375
5933289,1,B00EPH8SFS,"Bought this at Target on the spur of the moment to try to start a fitness routine that I would like enough to keep going with.  I had to turn it off after 5 minutes.  As a former dancer, I guess I could learn the moves after one or two watchings-although it really does look like she is dancing around her living room for the heck of it.  There is no type of instruction and the MUSIC IS DETESTABLE!!!  Further, her movements don't sync up with said music, which was obviously added later.  To that point-there are moments when it is clear that the video of her moving has been sped up to match up with the music.  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  This is going back to Target and I will be researching things on Amazon before any future workout DVD purchases!",1398297600,3,771,4.380281690140845
5933290,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I love, Love, Love this video. I am loving the beginner level, but still sweating and getting a really good workout.

5933291,3,B00EPH8SFS,This DVD is a little difficult because she never calls out any moves. I think it's mostly meant for people who already have a background in dance.,1397692800,,146,4.444444444444445
5933292,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I love Tracy Anderson DVD's so I thought I would really enjoy this but there are NO instructions whatsoever. She just starts dancing. Unless you already have some dance experience, it's hard to keep up....or even learn the steps.",1397433600,2,229,4.897435897435898

First, I didn't even realize the exercise portion started.  She just started dancing to the music.  There is no direction of any sort.  She literally just dances to the music with this smile on her face.  It's not that the moves are hard, just really awkward.  If I didn't know any better, I would think that she had no fitness experience at all.  It literally just looked like a skinny blonde bouncing around doing silly dance moves!! It sucked.

The music is terrible as well.  I feel duped.",1395878400,9,304,4.101694915254237
5933305,1,B00EPH8SFS,"To start off, I would like to consider myself a workout DVD connoisseur. My favorites include anything by Chalene Johnson (Turbo Jam/Turbo Fire) and the more challenging Jillian Michaels workouts. I enjoy some of the Crunch videos and Insanity can be pretty hardcore!
I recently purchased this on a whim (along with Step Up Revolution Dance), since I try to workout every day, and this was something different.
To start off, she has NO personality. A celebrity trainer??? Really? There is no motivation or any verbal cues of any kind. It isn't difficult, just very boring. Not only that, but the music is some horrible beat that doesn't even go with the rhythm of the ""dancing"" --- which isn't dancing at all, just a few of your general aerobic moves done over and over again. I guess I expected some fun, cutesy dance.

5933308,1,B00EPH8SFS,"Because that's pretty much all that's happening on this DVD.  There are basically 10 ""moves"" that she just recycles over and over through the workouts.

5933310,1,B00EPH8SFS,"I like Tracy Anderson but this video is basically worthless, almost like she phoned it in.

There is no consistancy to it, you do one move 8 times on one side, but only 3 on the other, and there isn't any flow to the routine.  Her moves are almost too easy (not dancing like) and I didn't even break a sweat or get my heart rate up.  My suggestion is to skip the dvd, put music on that gets you motivated, and dance your own way for 30 minutes.",1392854400,5,557,4.036363636363636

I got 4 of her videos and love them all!  This one is just a fun one to put in and dance to.. it takes a bit to learn her moves, but I enjoy it, and even put some of my own moves in!  I really like the video.  If you are the type that needs step by step instruction, then you don't want this one, as she doesn't tell you what she is doing next, you just follow her lead.",1392336000,,624,3.7251908396946565
5933312,5,B00EPH8SFS,"This one I could finish it, is the first time that I could do the entire video. Nice workout and music.",1391040000,,103,3.9523809523809526
5933313,4,B00EPH8SFS,"As undoubtedly explained, Tracy Anderson's new ""Cardio + Dance"" is composed of two seperate 30 minute ""dance-y"" workouts.  The biggest difference between this workout and her previous ones is a lack of choreography.  In previous workouts, you had to learn several combinations BEFORE working out, and the workout was comprised of just doing the combinations repeatedly for the length of an entire song.  The downside of that was having to take extra time to learn the combos.  The upside was that you were actually dancing some moderately challenging choreography, which felt great, and you got a pretty intense cardio workout.  This new workout is a complete change, a ""follow-the-leader"", style which I've never seen before.  There is no learning, no choreography...You literally just do what she is doing while she's doing it and try to keep up.

The good about this style is that you are working out, sweating, burning calories, right away. Just pop in the DVD and go. No extra time needed to learn anything.  The bad, and this will be a big gripe for many people, is that you have no idea what she is about to do until she does it or until it's already over. There also is absolutely no verbal instruction.  She never speaks once.  You get no verbal cueing about what comes next, but also, no annoying ""Yeah! You can do it!"" banter. Fortunately, the moves are not that fast and are very Beginner Level and generally repetitive.  We get A LOT of grapevines, step touches to the front, front and back taps with one foot and side to side hip shakes.  Though the counts vary (for example, on one set she'll do 4 hip shakes before switching to the next move, and on another set she'll do 8 before switching), with repetition you'll figure it out.  Your body and mind will probably eventually start to memorize movements.

Though this workout does have you covering some floor space and moving NON-STOP for 30 minutes, it's not nearly as intense as her previous ones, mainly because this one is a little slower paced and a lot lower impact. It has almost no hopping, and your feet don't really leave the floor for about 95% of the workout. However, there are some jumping jacks and a tiny bit of skipping thrown in here and there, but this is nothing compared to all the hopping and jumping done in her other dance DVDs.  So whereas in her previous ones I actually had to stop at certain points to catch my breath or relieve my tired legs, this one I was able to easily get through without stopping.  In fact, I had to really throw myself into the moves in order to max out the cardio benefit.  By the end, however, I was pretty sweaty and felt like I had a good workout.  It may not be my favorite workout ever in the world, but I enjoy it as a fun and different cardio workout that will last me for a few months, until I tire of it and move on to something else.  :-)

However, in order to really want to do this, you have to WANT to move.  And the music on this does nothing for me.  I enjoyed the warmup music, but once the beat kicks in for the main event, I just found it...blah.  Completely uninspiring.  My solution was to mute it and dance to my own music, which does wonders.  Of course, I had to find music that more or less fits the tempo of her music here, and I found that a lot of EDM and pop dance remixes fit well.  Some of the songs that I like to use with this right now include ""Sexy Chick"" by David Guetta, ""Blow(Cirkut Remix)"" by Ke$ha, ""Levels"" by Avicii and one of the remixes to ""Lights"" by Ellie Goulding, I forget which one...Some songs are close but not a perfect fit, but I just do the moves to the beat.  If its a little faster than TA, even better!  It's fun and I'm motivated to just move for half an hour.",1390867200,25,3737,4.392441860465116
5933314,5,B00EPH8SFS,"Let me first just begin by saying I love Tracy Anderson. Her style is different and, unlike other drill like instructors, her DVDs make me feel like I'm working out with a friend. Love her muscular structure work, but her cardios have been impossible due to ankle and knee problems. This solved that! Now mind you I can do some jumping but not as much as previous TA cardios require. I can follow this and pain level is low. Currently using with the post pregnancy DVD (and no I haven't given birth, just need intense an work) and alternating with the Mat CD. So far so good.

No learned dance sequences in this DVD. I barely broke a sweat as compared to her original Dance Cardio, where I sweat my butt off!
However, if you're looking for something to make you move for 30 min, this will do the trick. It is repetitive and geared towards beginners.",1390608000,2,571,4.428571428571429

5933317,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I own every Tracy DVD, including her very first one that I haven't seen anywhere since I purchased it years ago! I am NOT a dancer, I have two left feet and 'practice makes perfect'!! I have done Tae Bo and all of the regular aerobics classes at the gym (step, zumba, running, etc...) I've not found another workout that makes me sweat the way Tracy does! This workout is awesome, I have only done it once (I just got it)  and it's very basic compared to any of her other ones. If you can do a 'basic grapevine' then you can do this! There isn't any Queuing in this video, that is correct, BUT it's not hard to get the hang of it. I've been to many aerobics classes that I have had to pay extra close attention to the instructor because they're not shouting out the next move or combination, so it's not that much different.  She doesn't jump around as much on this one as her other ones, definitely a great one to START with, I did both cardio portions on here for my one workout because I generally like to get at least 45 minutes to an hour of cardio a day, I probably got about 45 minutes because of the warm-ups. She does have a pause between the two segments (workouts) and then another warm up before the second one.
This workout is nice also because you can make it as difficult as you choose by putting bounce into what she's doing, or adding arm movements with the bounce, and it takes it up a couple notches! I really enjoyed it, I didn't think I would sweat at first because it was so simple, but I put a lot more energy, arms and bounce into it, and I was dripping! Definitely a nice change up in my workout routines and great to have on the 'lazy' morning when you just want a quick 30 minute workout or don't feel like bouncing around, but still want a good workout. My body has changed a lot since I started doing Tracy's DVD's years back... I used to run about 6 miles a day, 6 days a week. Tracy makes me sweat a lot more than running or the stairs at the gym and my legs look 'longer and leaner' since I have started doing her videos. May I also recommend her other cardio one (has a lot of step by step, and this is the best one she's put out, in my opinion) Tracy Anderson Method Dance Cardio Workout dvd, and also her mat video, The Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout. Those two are awesome, and I wish that the rest of her cardio dvd's were like that one, it's the best one! I look forward to her future releases as I am a Tracy fan!

5933322,3,B00EPH8SFS,"I have a bagillion workout DVDs.  I finally succumbed to Tracy Anderson's will and bought this.  It is completely different from any other workout I have.

As stated by others, there is no instruction.  There's not even a ""good job"" from her at the end of the routine.  Nothing.  Just music and her dancing.  The ""routine"" is basically what anyone who has done a lot of aerobics would come up with of they were just dancing around in their basement to work out (lots of grapevines and stepping side to side).

Pro's
1) your brain doesn't get a rest.  You can't just look away knowing you have 12 more, now 11, come on ten... Etc etc.  The lack of counting keeps you engaged which I think gives you a better workout.
2) quick changes between the steps also means you can't rest in a move.  You are constantly doing something new.  She probably doesn't repeat anything at all more than about four times at once.
3) I liked the music and setting.
4) definitely one you can have fun with by sort of adding your own thing along the way.

Con's
1) I sort of feel like I paid $9 to watch her hop around.  I wouldn't be surprised if she just had a clock counting down in front of her and danced around for 30 minutes, ie no set choreography.
2) Not knowing what is coming next means you are sometimes stood still figuring out what way to turn and when (though this is less likely to be the case the more you do the workout).

All in all I think you will either enjoy the unstructured sort of abandon of this workout or you'll loathe it.  Since I tend to dislike many instructors with their cheesy motivational stuff and annoying voices, this is pretty good for me. 3 stars.",1389657600,,1665,4.305466237942122
5933323,2,B00EPH8SFS,I had read good things about this video so I bought it thinking this could get me into something new.  Not so much. Usually with beginner fitness videos the instructor talks you through each step.  There isn't one word spoken on this video. She doesn't repeat the steps for very long and then changes it to something else before I can figure out what she is doing.  I am usually pretty quick on picking up dance moves.  It looks like it would be fun but I am not interested enough to spend the time pausing and rewinding the tape to analyze what she is doing.,1389657600,2,559,4.295238095238095

The music is poor and her moves don't give me a total head to toe workout.  She doesn't say anything and tends to look off toward her left at someone/something from time to time.  I didn't think the moves were great dance moves either.  The second workout is worse than the first.  In one move she is bending over and then moves into another position which I could not follow because I didn't know when to switch positions since she doesn't talk.  I had to keep looking up from the bent over position to see what she was doing next.  Awful!  I will be giving this DVD away.  Not at all what I expected.

5933327,5,B00EPH8SFS,Great cardio for a beginner. I wish I had this video when I was getting started. I ought this for my mom who is in her 50s and she loves it.,1389312000,,140,3.5483870967741935
5933328,3,B00EPH8SFS,This DVD has no instruction what so ever.  No instruction on how to do the moves.  No instruction or warning when she switches from one move to the next. It is essentially just a DVD of her doing free style modern dance.  Its hard to follow.  But I did work up a sweat trying so it isn't a total loss.  I don't recommend this unless you have some dance skills or a natural ability to dance.  I have 2 left feet so this wasn't a good DVD for me.,1388966400,2,444,3.932584269662921
5933329,4,B00EPH8SFS,"Just purchased this DVD and after hearing so much about the Tracy Anderson method and all the Gwyneth Paltrow plugs I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought it was pretty good. Sure I could just dance around in my kitchen for free, but she give you new moves and I found the lack of spoon fed instructions refreshing. Gives your brain a workout too. I won't always be in the mood to do this one but it will definitely have a place in my rotation of DVDs.",1387843200,2,457,4.146067415730337
5933330,1,B00EPH8SFS,"Tracy Anderson is supposed to be a fitness expert.

I guess the only way to follow this is if you are one of her high-paying clients.

It is TERRIBLE!!!!! Do not buy this DVD!!!!!  (unless you want to watch her dance around...  There is no instruction at all.)",1387497600,2,260,4.354166666666667
5933331,1,B00EPH8SFS,"Having heard SO much about TA, I finally gave her a try. I was very disappointed with this video. She just 'dances' around, barely in rhythm with the music and gives absolutely no instruction. I don't even think the movement is choreographed. It's like she's just having her own little dance party, and forgot to tell us. Seems pretty cheap to me. I followed her for a while. Barely broke a sweat.",1387497600,4,397,4.527777777777778
5933332,1,B00EPH8SFS,"This was also my first Tracy A. video.  I agree with many of the others, that the lack of instruction made the workout confusing.  She used many of the same movements, but they were random, and didn't really evolve into a consistent routine.  I was also curious if the ""Tracy Anderson Method"" involved this same sort of no instruction, random movement type of thing.  After watching a few excerpts from her routines on YouTube, it is apparent that is the case.  Some people really enjoy her method, but I am not one of them.  If anyone else would like this disc, I'd be happy to mail it to you free of charge, COD.",1387065600,3,614,4.389380530973451
5933333,2,B00EPH8SFS,"I am a huge fan of Tracy's and I love her Dance Cardio I and II. This is disappointing. Music is not good, routines are boring and too easy if you are used to Tracy's high-powered, fun dance style. Please, please Tracy give us another advanced dance cardio video with good music!!!",1386547200,,281,4.423076923076923
5933334,5,B00EPH8SFS,"First of all, this dvd was just released at the begining of December. I had it on pre-order so ignore any reviews prior to the release of the dvd since there is no way these people had it before hand.

I have tried Tracys dance videos before and they were difficult, and I am no dancer. This one is a huge change, it's alot easier but still a great workout. I clocked several thousand steps on my fitbit using this dvd for just one of the workouts. I liked the music too but you can use your own. This is a good dvd to use to workout at home especially if you don't want to leave to go run or anything and want to still burn calories.",1386547200,,634,3.9921259842519685
5933335,2,B00EPH8SFS,"Not good! Unless  you are psychic, you cannot follow this routine! She does all these moves without any instruction! I could not believe! Was not able to  follow this in anyway. I also found that her stairing at herself in the mirrors, was offsetting to say the least.",1386374400,2,268,4.5625
5933336,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I do this workout (both routines) whenever I cannot get to a dance class. It's fun and makes me work up a sweat. The lack of instructions is not a drawback, since Tracy is easy to follow (especially after you've done the routine more than twice). I recommend this DVD to beginners in particular, as it is just challenging enough to keep you engaged.",1385683200,,349,4.46875
5933337,1,B00EPH8SFS,"There is absolutely no cueing in this DVD, AND she goes super fast. I have a lot of workout DVDs and I'm a former dancer. This workout was so bad, I stopped it after 7 minutes. Save your money!!",1385596800,3,194,4.0
5933338,1,B00EPH8SFS,"I've heard so many great things about Tracy Anderson workouts, I finally broke down and picked up this dvd last night.  It turned out to be the worst exercise dvd I have ever purchased - and I own a lot (at least 50 exercise dvds and videos combined).  Before you purchase this dvd, you should know, there is absolutely NO instruction or cueing.  You basically have to follow what she does on the tv screen.  I'm no dancer, but I'm quite coordinated; nonetheless, it's not easy to follow Tracy's ""dance"" moves when you don't know what to expect.  And the music is not most motivating either.  I can get this kind of workout mimicking my 10 year old niece dancing!  This was my very first Tracy Anderson dvd and sadly, my last.",1384300800,10,726,4.454545454545454
5933339,5,B00EPH8SFS,Okay I rated this 5 star because I'm confused.  It says you can pre-order the DVD and it is not released until December 3rd of this year.  How are there all these reviews on a DVD that isn't released yet?,1383868800,,204,4.075
5933340,3,B00EPH8SFS,"I stumbled across this dvd and thought I would give it a try.  This was my first time trying one of Tracy Anderson's workouts.  I would say that I have a mixed review:
Positives:
* It is a pretty good workout.  Not overly strenuous but a solid workout.  I would put this as a middle of the road cardio workout.
* I am definitely not a dance person but was able to keep up with the dvd with some work.

Negatives

* I did not like having no instructions.  This was different from other workouts that I have used.  Others may not mind this but it was not for me.  I wish that it had stated this on the cover.
* It was fun at first but got boring as the workout went on.
* I didn't really care for the music.
* If I did get lost, it was difficult to recover.  A lot of the moves seemed a bit disjointed.

In summary, I will probably give this one a few more tries.  If you are into dance, this may be exactly what you are looking for.  But if you are not, I would suggest that you go with other cardio workouts.",1383523200,25,1008,3.9064039408866993
5933341,5,B00EPH8SFS,"Anyone who's read review of Tracy Anderson online, knows that she's the black sheep of the fitness world. She seems to have fans who either love or hate her. As someone who's been using her method for the last 3 months, I can tell you my arms look fantastic and my abs are firm. She's been a significant part of my almost 70 pound weight loss. However, after watching the cardio in Metamorphasis, I wasn't sure that I could handle all of the hopping around as while I don't have two left feet I'm also not a fantastic dancer. So when I saw the preview for this video I got super excited. This looked like something a beginner dance person like me could handle.
 Like all of Tracy's videos there is a bit of a learning curve, but with all of the repetition it's easy to pick up and after a few times doing it you have the counting and routine down in your head. I'm not one of those people who have to get every single thing perfect the first time I do a workout video to love it. But I can tell you as I've been doing it the last two weeks, you pick up the routines quickly. My butt has gotten smaller and my legs seem slightly more lean and stronger. I lost 3 pounds the first week I did this and about 2 pounds this last week. I did this with Tracy's Mat workout. Although, I did this video 5 days a week and the Mat workout only about 3 times a week.
  I tried a Jillian Michaels workout today I couldn't do last month because I just didn't have the energy to get through all the portions and I was able to do it today with no problem. I attribute this workout to getting through the whole thing as the cardio portions were always the issue and this dance cardio I've been doing with Tracy for the last two weeks has really built my endurance.
 In short, Tracy Anderson has a lot of critics because of some of the comments she'd made in the past, but as someone who's been doing her workout for more than 1 day, her method really does work. And with this video, I've even come to see what she means by dance cardio being a great workout in conjunction with her mat videos. That being said while I do Tracy's arms and abs every week,I also recommend Ellen Barrett, Lesline Sansone, and Jillian Michaels. All of these ladies have led me to lose a lot of weight in the last 5 months.",1381968000,75,2283,4.158371040723982

8608113,1,B00EPH8SFS,"Got this as part of a 4 DVD set. They all blur together (like her routines), but I believe this was the 4th one and for this one I simply laughed out loud. After an introduction where she said ""this might be repetitive..."" she turned on the music and wiggled about with no voiceover or instructions. I thought perhaps this was just the introduction fading out, but no, this was it! I ejected the disk after a minutes and returned the set. (I have dozens of DVDs and I've never found an instructor yet who didn't mirror her ""left"" and ""right"" so it was from your perspective. Add in terrible cueing, long routines where each step is repeated only once or twice, and all in all, that's a recipe for confusion and frustration. If you like dancing, check out Petra's DVD - great cueing, easy to follow, etc.)",1514937600,,804,4.4391891891891895
8608114,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I love this DVD.  I had been doing the first 30 min routine, at least a couple times a week since this past fall, and have noticed more definition in my arms, accompanied with more strength.  I know this is fact, for,  last fall ('16) I had been doing a weight lifting DVD and if I used 8lb weights, my arms and shoulders would kill me for days.  This past fall, after starting this dance routine, I was able to use my 8lbs weights w ease!

I have only done the second dance routine 1 time through thus far, and it was fun, though didn't have my favorite, ""pizza serving,"" move.  My only complaint.",1513987200,,598,4.201754385964913

8608120,5,B00EPH8SFS,"I Love, Love, Love this DVD!!! This is a great introduction to the Tracy Anderson Method. I wanted something lower impact than her other Dance Cardio videos so I can work my way up to the harder DC vids and eventually Metamorphosis DC. This is great for beginners, or anyone who wants to add another DC video to their rotation. I can imagine adding this to my Meta DC rotation, on low energy days. I'm 5'3 180lbs and I can do this with no joint pain, its a great, fun workout. I'm rotating all the Beginner TAM videos: The Method for Beginners, Beginner Dance Cardio, Beginner Mat Workout. I will typically do this video or Beginner DC, followed by Beginner Mat. This is similar to the Meta format that TA recommends. Dance Cardio followed by a Mat workout. I also keep my room humid and heated while I workout to replicate the studio environment. I end up drenched in sweat, its also great for my skin. I've lost 5 pounds in my first week doing this routine. I did not follow any of the TA diet plans, I just switched from processed to whole foods and ate more fruits, vegetables and lean meat. I do not count calories either. I also only worked out 4 times the first week. Anyway, I'm in love with the Tracy Anderson Method. I'm already seeing great results!",1462147200,2,1260,4.412017167381975
