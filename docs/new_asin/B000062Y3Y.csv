7958108,5,B000062Y3Y,"I saw this movie on Lifetime several times, I am a big fan of Jaclyn Smith and Brad Johnson. The movie is about abuse and control and back in the day, the laws weren't set for domestic abuse. I am still waiting for this movie to be released into the US/Canada region 1.",1455148800,,269,4.09433962264151
7958109,1,B000062Y3Y,I was very excited to receive this product that I had bought for a friend.  When she put it in her dvd player it didn't work.  This product will work only on European dvd.  Great disappointment. Have to send it back to England and pay the cost of postage both ways. Buyer Beware.,1306800000,7,279,4.226415094339623
