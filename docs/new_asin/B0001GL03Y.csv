This brought back wonderful memories of the group who I did see live in the late seventies.  There music reflected not only folk roots but also the turbulant times of the late 60's during the height of the Veitnam Protest movement.

1998506,5,B0001GL03Y,"It is about time that Peter, Paul & Mary release this incredible collection of truly a 3 some of great talents. There isn't a folk group that touch their sensitivity, professional delivery of there musical performance. I have followed this group for 40 years and their enthusiam for the celebration of the human spirit hasn't waned an inch. They are as vibrant as ever. You won't go wrong on this purchase. It is handsomely packaged with great care.
If there was a disappointment it would be that the DVD that was enclosed had some pretty shakey video and audio reproductions. However, with an understanding of what was retrievable in ""those days"" it was still appreciated.

1998522,4,B0001GL03Y,"PETER, PAUL & MARY - CARRY IT ON is a documentary often seen during PBS fundraisers that has a dual agenda. For the several participants, it's an opportunity to reaffirm the social activism of the 1960s (and beyond) that motivated them then and still does today. For PBS, this career overview of the musical trio includes in great part video highlights of their long association with that network. Thus the show's main flaw for older fans like me.

Glimpses of the group's first era (1962-70) are few, all too brief and are finished within 20 minutes. These moments include for example clips from the 1963 March on Washington, PPM at two different Newport Folk Festivals, and perfomances on the Jonathan Winters and Andy Williams shows.

Mary Travers offers an insight into this trio of very different personalities. Peter Yarrow, she says, is highly disciplined, Noel Paul Stookey disciplined but with a soft edge and she, Mary, was: ""Don't bother me,"" the original rebel. With this perspective, we notice in a mid-60s TV appearance that in doing a song Mary was prone to turning the back of her shoulder to Peter and singing directly to Paul. This may subcosciously indicate that both of them felt Yarrow was too much the taskmaster.

Peter reveals that Noel was often declaring he wanted to leave the group, which is explained by Stookey as making a right-hand turn in order to be with family after a seven year grind of 200 show dates and recording sessions. You certainly can't blame him. It was ""time off for good behavior.""

In 1978, Yarrow got them all back together again for an anti-nukes concert he was organizing. This reteaming ""stuck"" and they remained a trio until Miss Travers died in 2009.

The lion's share of ""Carry It On"" is segments from several PPM TV specials, but we also see their activities in El Salvador during some of the darkest days of that Central American country's history.

Other participants in this 2004 program (produced in part by Peter) are Ronnie Gilbert and Pete Seeger (of the Weavers), Tom Paxton, Richie Havens, manager Albert Grossman and recording producer Phil Ramone. There's archive footage of several more folk artists as they appeared on PPM's PBS shows.

1998536,5,B0001GL03Y,"This is actually more of an documentary in praise of Peter, Paul, and Mary.  It is not a concert.  There are songs, though, between each interview or clipping.  I usually skipped the the words that were spoken, and listened to the words that were sung.  The songs are good and I enjoyed them.

As a tribute to these three, I think the DVD succeeded.  And as a look into their music, I think the DVD succeeded as well.  It is really hard sometimes to separate their activism from their songs.  Are they not one and the same at times?  The DVD certainly answers that question.

For now, if you just want to listen to good harmony, get a good CD.

If you want to take a look at the ""musical legacy"" of the trio, which involves their work in American civil and global rights, buy this DVD.  If that turns you off, just enjoy the songs that are there.",1315612800,2,846,4.251572327044025

1998538,5,B0001GL03Y,"After reading the EDITOR's so called review of this wonderful trio. I got so upset I was ready to empty my shopping cart and never shop here again! Those of us who shop for DVD's of our favorite groups/singers do not want to hear about how they have lost their hair or their figures! That was so unnessesary! Not to mention the slam of the song ""Puff the magic dragon"". This was such a huge hit and a wonderful memory from a childhood long gone. I have several of the P,P & M albums on my iPod and will continue to add them till there are no more. My favorite song? ""The Marvelous Toy"". They did a childs album that will make you smile while you are listening to them. I don't know if this song is in this DVD, but I hope to find it someday if it isn't.  Yes, they were radical for the era they came from. I give the editor that. But let's leave the comments about hair and waistsize out of your reviews. Someday, I hope this editor can look in the mirror and not see a fat balding idiot.

More over, if you get a chance to watch this group, take it. Those of us that lived the 60's will remember these songs and find ourselves singing along with them.",1296691200,28,1152,4.092920353982301
1998539,5,B0001GL03Y,"for ANY PETER,PAUL& MARY fan!!! There are lots of clips from their earlier years 1961-1970, and clips from 1978-2004.....keep in mind..I'm sure you know by now that Mary Travers left this world in 2009,and so there are no clips that go all the way upto now, if you want that you will have to wait until Noel, and Peter come out with something.

They are still singing together afterall. Um....THIS documentary here includes a 2003/4 rendition of their very first song ever sung together as a trio....Mary had A Little Lamb in 1961. I wish however, that there was actual footage of them singing that song  THEN, and lots more clips from their early years as that is when they were such a smash success. When I see clips from their shows, like at the March On Washoington 1963, and 1969,and on Jonathan Winters in 1969 and I see the floweredress Mary's wearing, I'm reminded of the flower children, I wasn't born until 1967, so that was a generation or two before my time!!

But if you take an interest in the Sixties, and politics, social, political activism, oh yeah and folk music too, this is a great beginners start. It's also good if you're older and want to take a stroll down memory lane.

But PP&M were always a current folk group, who didn't want to be labeled as a ""nostalgia act,"" in the early 2000's  they came out with a tear-jerker called ""Jesus Is On The Wire,""  which I'm surmising is not only about homosexuals and the need to respect their rights to live their lives the same as do straight people,
I also think the title is suggestive of the horrendous murder of Mathew Shepherd was beaten to a bloody pulp, hung on a barbed wire fence, and left to die...when asked why they did that to him , they said it was because he was gay. I think it's  wonderful that PP&M, straight as they are, rose to the occasion in this very sad but important song.

Last but not least, I enjoy clip from Peter Paul& Mommy Too, a heart warming footage of Mary with her grand daughter, Wyllie on her lap looking up at her, in the rocking chair quietly, and proud as ever listening while proud Grandma Mary Travers sang  For Baby For Bobby. Just for her. The light just sparkles in Wyllie's brown eyes...you can tell she is in absolute heaven!! She adores her grandma!!

And Noel is his wacky old self on The Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly.
He gets all the kids excited, and laughing histerically as always.

Anyhow, I hope you consider this product,I've been a serious PP&M fan since 1984 and so I ought to know a good PP&M documentary when I see one.....THIS HAS OODLES AND OODLES OF COMMENTARY BY MANY PEOPLE including  Pete Seeger, Phil Ramone,Tom Paxton, Ronnie Gilbert (of The Weavers.) Bob DeCormier (their director), as well as by PP&M THEMSELVES.

And that makes this very good indeed. Trust me.",1293321600,13,2797,4.503952569169961

I have been a true fan since I was 8 years old, I am now 24 years old and will soon be 25 this year.  I have some very sad news: MARY TRAVERS of PP&M died on Sept: 16th- Wedesday evening at 7:30 pm of cancer and complications from one of the treatments from KEMO THARAPY. She was 72 years old. This DVD will bring back a lot of memories for a lot of people. I was born in the 1980's generation but have learned a lot about them from watching this DVD so many times. I am hoping that now Warner Brothers and Rhino records will release the 4 original PBS specials onto DVD. The 25th Aniversery concert in 1986 covers all of there greatest hits Puff The Magic Dragon, Blowin In The Wind, If I Had A Hammer, Where Have All The FLowers Gone, This Land Is Your Land Like The First Time, Greenwood, Light One Candle and other songs. The music will always be remembered now that PP&M are DONE!! Marys life is celebrated through watching this DVD. A bid farwell to PP&M performing and to Mary as well. MARY ALLEN TRAVERS 1936-2009 .

If you haven't heard much of Peter, Paul and Mary, this DVD will give you almost a full taste of each of them, as each sings a number of solo songs by their own other than group singing. Here you will discover that not only are Peter and Mary magnetic and charming, Paul's singing is poetic too... I find this DVD rewarding enough.",1148947200,6,605,4.353982300884955

That is where I first saw this program and I had to have the DVD because it gets behind the concerts to show us how the trio got together, how they work together, why they are so unique, and what they have meant to the history of the United States (and a lot of other places, like El Salvador). Their music has consistently called Americans to live into the ideals stated in the founding documents of our country and to be compassionate to all who do not have the privileges white Middle Class Americans enjoy. I not only agree with them, I am energized by them to reach for those good things. This DVD is a treasured retrospective on their career and crusades, and I can't think of any follower of PP&M in all of the generations they have touched who would not love it.",1142899200,59,880,4.33939393939394

When I first started looking at it, I was disappointed.  I kept listening and it brought back the history of that time listening to them and the feelings that they shared.  It really was not political, even though I disagree with some of their opinions in their music, it was a statement. The music made a peacefull statement, not the cop killer statements in some of the music today.  It was truely GREAT!!  It showed them singing in the past and singing together today.  It was truely a pleasure to watch and re-live the memories, but I am only 39...so how would I know?  NOT!!

It seems to promise ""something"" that it never delivers.  Many of the best performances on this DVD are interupted by voice overs.  Peter, Paul, & Mary seem more angry for less reason on this DVD.  I would have preferred seeing their beginnings explored a little more thoroughly, and more complete b&w concert footage included.  Their early concert performances are barely touched upon.  More focus is given to their treasonous acts against the United States, than to the music that they did so well together.  For me, this DVD is way too wordy.  Their music speaks for itself, when it is permitted to do so, which is very rarely done on this DVD.  A great disappointment.",1101168000,33,809,4.804347826086956

In these times of plain money music, of the abundance of marketing and the absolute lack of ideals, Peter Paul and Mary give you their honest, their lovely testimony of the true meaning of popular music. Ever since the start of human civilization, from India, China  or Greece to the Plain Chant of the Middle Ages, popular music has stood up as a transparent reflection of our most sacred longings and aspirations as human beings. Our hopes, our despair, the way we love, our desire for true human understandig, the transcendent living within us...all that has been expressed through the poetical and the musical aspects of folk art.  Well...this is it! The peace movement of the 60's, Luther King, the strong criticism to US atrocities in El Salvador during the Reagan administration, the voice of freedom, the call to respect, and not to hate, the ""different"", the honest carrer of three talented folk singers who still captivate millions for a clear and simple reason: they still have something to say; they're still willing to say it aloud and they choose beautiful vocal harmonies and a magnificent musical climate to say it!  Anyone wondering why these times are not producing honesty ant talent like this? THE ANSWER, MY FRIEND....Please watch this DVD carefully.  The message is clear: true music survives because it comes from the deepest and the most sacred sides of our human souls.

Folk singers tend to lean to the left, often lean so hard, that they'd be leaning on the floor, if there isn't a wall in the way. I tend to prefer founding fathers, and biblical paradigms. I do listen to opposing views, particularly when well thought out, and well presented. Folk artists, like Peter, Paul, & Mary are at least true believers, and not just the political hacks one finds within the beltway.

I bought this DVD, gently used, as a gift for a friend, who's a HUGE PP&M fan, and has seen them live. If your close to that, this presentation is Essential. For the casual fan, I'd recommend the Rhino CD, Peter Paul and Mary - ""The Very Best of..."", with 25 tracks. Heck, any American music collection, should have that much, to be called a collection. I'm in between, and unsure about getting another one for myself. I listen more often than I watch, and I'm not sure that celebrating socialist activism, is something I'm going to want to do, over and over. But, I'm very glad to have seen ""Carry It On"" at least once, it certainly is a musical legacy.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Best-of-Peter-Paul-Mary/dp/B0009YA39U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Best of Peter Paul & Mary</a>",1472860800,,1296,5.027906976744186
