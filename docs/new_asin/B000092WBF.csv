7988633,5,B000092WBF,"Once again Cecilia Bartoli displays why she is the best of the contemporary classical vocalists. While shunning the trend of many modern artists to seek out a larger audience via recordings of ""pop"" standards and the like, Ms. Bartoli has continually committed to deeping her skills within the classical genre and bringing us many otherwise neglected masterpieces. One goes to her for knowledge - not the other way around.
This performance is unusual for a number of different reasons, two in particular. First is that it opens with a long, beautiful performance by the Concentus Musicus Wien. How many other top-billed artists would give over this much time to the oft forgotten ensemble?
Second is the mezzo herself. No longer the slender young colt of earlier recordings, she is now considerably larger. While some may be sightly taken aback when the huge, full-figured diva takes the stage, once she begins to sing, the listener is struck by the parallel growth of her vocal prowness as well. By all means, keep it up. This is an altogether wonderful performance. We can only hope that the future brings both bigger and better achievements from Ms. Bartoli.",1056326400,27,1161,4.989690721649485
