4155197,5,B003M9ZAC4,"As others noted, it's been years since Season Three was released. I had been wondering if sales were so poor that the rest of R&B would remain lost, but no, at long last, here's Season Four! You simply cannot go wrong with these shows! Often much more intellectual humor than you would suspect; it's not just a kids' show, but a funny look many aspects of society of the time. Jay Ward rules ;)",1278633600,25,394,4.337837837837838

4155225,5,B003M9ZAC4,"It's been five years since we last got a season set of Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends, and I'd just about given up hope that we'd ever get season 4.  But I finally got my wish, and I've laughed my way through this set.

This half hour TV cartoon from the 1960's features puns, puns, and more puns.  Trust me, if you don't like puns, you need to pass right by this set.  There is nothing of interest to you here.  But if you love a good pun as much as I do, you'll love every silly minute of this show.

Each show had five segments.  The first and last are the continuing adventures of Rocky and Flying Squirrel and his best friend Bullwinkle J. Moose as they get caught in life and death situations fighting Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.  These stories are serialized, so you'll want to keep watching so you can find out what happens to them next.  All told, we get five complete stories in this set.  They include:

Painting Thief - Boris and Natasha rob a French museum of their paintings.  To elude capture, they mail the paintings to Bullwinkle, who then gets discovered as the next great artist.

Guns of Abalone - Boris is firing at random on the world until they deliver Moose and Squirrel.  But our heroes are already on the way, if they can survive gun fire and sinking ships.

The Treasure of Monte Zoom - Boris is on the trail of a treasure buried on the bottom of a lake near Frostbite Falls.  And the way to find it?  Drain the lake.

Goof Gas Attack - Boris has invented a substance that makes genius complete idiots.  But it doesn't affect the already stupid, so the government calls on Bullwinkle to foil the villain.

Banana Formula - Bullwinkle is stalked by Boris after eating a banana with the formula to the new explosive Hushaboom.

These stories are played for puns and groaners more than anything else, so at times the story takes some turns that are illogical even for a cartoon featuring talking animals in a world otherwise populated with humans.  But when I let that go and just enjoy the ride, I find myself laughing hysterically and the antics of the characters.  And I love the fact that they break the rules, talking to the audience and including the narrator in the action all the time.

Each half hour episode always starts and ends with a segment in whatever the current story is.  Up second is either Fractured Fairytales of Aesop and Son.  Either way, you get a fractured tale that bears little resemblance to anything you might be familiar with.  Again, the silly and puns reign.

The middle segment is Bullwinkle's Corner, devoted to poetry readings, or Mr. Know-It-All, in which Bullwinkle shows you how not to do something.  These segments were often a disappointment to me because I recognized quite a few of them from previous seasons.  It's too bad they couldn't come up with some new material.  Not that I wasn't laughing again.  These are funny no matter how many times you've seen them.

Finally, we end with Peabody's Improbable History or Dudley Do-Right.  Peabody is a dog who has invented a time machine to introduce his boy Sherman to history.  And it's a good thing since Peabody always has to save the day and set history on the right track.  Even one time when he's home sick in bed they need his suggestions.  Dudley Do-Right is a spoof of melodramas as Canadian Mountie Dudley tries to finally defeat his arch nemesis Snidely Whiplash.  I think Dudley is the least punny thing you'll find here, although they are so silly they are still very funny.

If you sit down looking for the animation we get today, you'll be highly disappointed.  It's low budget quality.  It's not bad, but it's not great, even for that time.

But the joy of the show is the jokes.  I can't stop laughing at the antics of the characters or the puns they come up with.  And their self-referencal humor just adds to the fun.

The show does contain some references to life in the 60's, especially with Boris and Natasha obviously being Eastern European villains with faint communist ideologies.  Today's kids won't get all the jokes, but they will still appreciate much of the action.

There were only 19 half hour episodes in season 4, so we get two discs here.  The price actually reflects that quite nicely, not being nearly as high as the earlier seasons were when I got them years ago.  And that's all we get.  There are no extras.  There is an episode guide on a piece of paper that floats free in the case.  I hope I don't lose mine.  Also of note, there is a mostly clear R&B logo at the start of each segment that stays for about 30 seconds.  Yes, I wish it weren't there, but it isn't a surprise since it's been on the other sets as well.

I know there are still more episodes of this great show out there, so I hope we see another release soon.  But until then, I'm glad I finally got to enjoy Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends season 4.",1431216000,,4874,4.451357466063349

Rocky and Bullwinkle to me as a child were heroic. I used to really fret over their safety. Now I just smile at their innocence and knowing they always win.

4155239,5,B003M9ZAC4,"""Hello, low I.Q.ers!"", as Bullwinkle once said. ""A thunder of jets in an open sky, a streak of gray, and a cheerful 'HI!'... A loop, a whirl, and a vertical climb, and once again you'll know it's time, for..."" Rocky and Bullwinkle's 4th season DVD set (reviewed by ToonXpert87)! ""...starring that Jet-age aerial ace, Rocket J. Squirrel, with his pal Bullwinkle the moose, and a host of others!"" As our review opens today, we find there were only 19 shows in Rocky and Bullwinkle's 4th season, all restored and remastered, all contained on just 2 DVDs in a flip-open case made like a book (as most Frostbite Falls residents hated reading books). Since 2006, we were starting to think the 4th and 5th seasons would never be on season sets, until 2010 when season 4 came out on DVD, and 2011 for the 5th and last season! Due to the massive amount of content on these 2 dual-layered, single-sided discs, there's no bonus features at all, not even a sneak peek of the 5th and final season, nor closed-captioning nor disc subtitles in any DVD set of Rocky and Bullwinkle! With this set, there are 38 Rocky and Bullwinkle segments, and the entire runs of all the other segments should be completed with this set, with and without bridging sequences, with all repeats in season 5's set; those being Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop and Son, Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-it-all, Peabody's Improbable History, and Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties; 57 in all in the 4th season! Even if it is a short season compared to the others, we still get lots of witty, punny, and wacky humor in these 19 shows, however one small scene is somehow missing on this set; that being in The Treasure of Monte Zoom, it originally went as Boris stopped tugging at the plug of Lake Sal De Bain, he told Natasha they needed help to pull it, after it was too heavy for them. Don't ask me how or why that was cut out, even from one of the ""best of"" volumes, either disc in this set could still handle it since the short scene was only a few seconds long. Other than that, you still get a HUGE amount of content on both discs, even with no bonuses! Like with season 3, all of the 4th season starts and ends with the theme of season 1 mixed with the music of season 2, need I say more? I haven't heard if this set was reissued in a single DVD case, like seasons 1 to 3 of both Rocky & Bullwinkle AND SpongeBob recently were, if you didn't like this set's flipbook designs, but it is a good ""idear"", or ""idee"", for those who don't like such DVD case designs. Once you have seasons 1 to 3 of Rocky and Bullwinkle, you shouldn't stop now; the show's not over yet! Be with us next time for the 5th and final season's review labeled; ""A TV Pioneer's Swan Song"" or ""It Ain't Over Until the Moose, and Moosylvania, Sinks!""",1421971200,,2776,4.413255360623782

4155262,5,B003M9ZAC4,"This series ranks among my favorite animations of all time. Even though the animation itself isn't the classiest around, the humor keeps this one going: Cold War angst, cultural references, horrible puns, and the rest. And the additional features, beyond R&B themselves, create cockeyed views of old familiars, especially Fractured Fairytales and Aesop & son. The generally straightfaced presentation, right up to groanable punchlines, only adds to the dichotomy of intelligent humor and plain old silliness.

For better or worse, they've kept the vignettes that originally introduced commercials - after the first five or ten repetitions of each, I would have been grateful for some editing. And there's the redundancy in the R&B features themselves, in the lengthy recap of the previous episode, even if aired in the same program.

But, the editors chose to keep the original material in its entirety, and I can't fault them for that. This holds an honored place in my collection, and I'll look forward to coming back again and again in years to come.

Rocky and Bullwinkle.
These cartoons are so much a part of me, some friends told me I remind them of a certain squirrel...
 even though I don't like to fly.

Irreverent and sweet and funny and ridiculous and punny.

Yes, Looney Tunes had the gift of Mel Blanc creating terrific voices for a classic cast of characters.  Mel was a true gift to American radio (Jack Benny Program) and cartoons.  Most of the story themes however, usually involved characters chasing, blowing up, or in other ways clocking one another.  Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends had absolutely wonderful character voices.  The high energy of William Conrad's narration of Rocky's adventures remains invigorating and funny.  In addition, the stories contained many different themes.  Some had wonderfully clever twists on childhood stories, as seen in Fractured Fairy Tales.  Others related to history (Peabody's History).  Many instances of funny plays-on-words and other clever comedy appeals to adults as well as children.  If you enjoy fun character voices and a variety of story themes, you will enjoy this wonderful and wacky show.

I think the reason for the delay between Seasons 3 and 4 is because Sony Wonder (the distributor of Seasons 1 - 3) folded several years ago, and it took time for Jay Ward Productions to find a new distributor, Vivendi Entertainment.

According to Wikipedia, the episodes were unified under one name for legal reasons; that's why we don't have the unique ""Bullwinkle Show"" and ""Rocky and His Friends"" openings and closings.  I'd like to see the PBS documentary OF MOOSE AND MEN: THE ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE STORY be made available on DVD as well.

The ""Best of ..."" DVDs are, I'm sure, all well and good, but we who love and remember the show in its original form (or even in any of its subsequent formats) want it all!

I'm praying this season 4 sells really well so we soon see more seasons being released until we have it all. I'll buy every one! But please don't make us wait 5 years until the next season is released, which is how long we had to wait for this one.

No, there aren't any extras or subtitles on this season, but it's likely they ran out of extras to attach, and we can live without the subtitles.

We just want more of the seasons, with or without frills! And the packaging is still really fine.

Some notes: By this point the show was called ""The Bullwinkle Show"" and there are a couple of places where Rocky is clearly upset at this but there is no way the viewer of this DVD set would understand this as the first season open and credits are still being used here. The narrator also makes reference to the Bullwinkle Show. Oh well. They could have at least provided the high stepping Bullwinkle Show open as an extra.

(Released August 17, 2010 by Vivendi Classic Media)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

Let's get this matter out of the way up front.  The TWO ORIGINAL television programs from which this material is culled were titled: ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS, followed by THE BULLWINKLE SHOW.

If ever there were a show called ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" - or ""Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends"" - it would have been something cobbled together for syndication.

And ""cobbled together"" may be the best way to describe the attempts to recreate a fifty-year old show with many different component parts.  Same applies to the early Hanna-Barbera series.

It may actually be IMPOSSIBLE, by this point in time, to reconstruct a show like this in an exact duplication of its original form.  Pieces are lost to history.  Shows had differing content of ""new vs. repeat"" material, etc.  And, frankly speaking, not everyone associated with such a project HAS ACTUALLY SEEN a show like this in its original state.  They might be forced to go by hearsay and the inescapable ""Things They Read Somewhere on the Internet"".

Given this, I'd have to say that the producers of this series of DVD collections have done a fine job of creating something called ""ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE AND FRIENDS"" out of the remains of ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS and THE BULLWINKLE SHOW.

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Authenticity of the Experience:  Please refer to the opening paragraphs above.

Music Substitution:  The original theme music, and that which heralds the start of the many of the component parts, has been substituted.  The new music is inferior to anyone who can still hear the old themes echoing in the recesses of his or her mind. There's even a faux-William Conrad voice calling the series ""Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends"", as this music plays.  Thankfully, the episodes themselves were rarely scored; so watching them still feels ""right"".

Bugs:  Not a guest cameo by ""The Bunny"", alas, but a transparent (but annoying nonetheless) ""R&B"" Logo at the lower right corner of the screen.  Just as you'd see on modern TV broadcasts.  GET A CLUE, PRODUCERS... We KNOW this is ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" (...or are you plugging ""Rhythm and Blues"" music?) without the BUG.  In fact, you might be surprised to learn that we buy DVDs... TO GET AWAY FROM THAT INTRUSIVE CLUTTER!  Since this is the 4th edition, I don't think this is going to change.

Some Double-Dipping:  The Rocky and Bullwinkle serials ""Treasure of Monte Zoom"", ""Guns of Abalone"", and ""Goof Gas Attack"", included here, were all previously released on the various ""Best of..."" mini collections.  But, I guess we can forgive that, as they are packaged here as Season Four.  The six-part ""Painting Theft"" and the twelve-part ""Banana Formula"" serials appear to be new to DVD.

The Extra Features:  There are NO extra features!  Can't really complain too loudly, given the amount of material at the price - but something (even old promos and the like) would be welcome.

All in all, there's really not a lot to complain about, once your ears adjust to the non-authentic music (I'm not certain mine will ever COMPLETELY do so, due to so many years of watching the original broadcasts) - and if you can manage to look past or ignore the BUGS (I can't completely do that either).

The PROS:

The Packaging:  Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends: The Complete Season Four comes in a very sturdy package that ""opens like a book"" with two discs - one on each inside page.  It is nicely illustrated, though the portrait of Rocky must be one of the WORST drawings of the Flying Squirrel ever done.  And, when you're talking about a bad drawing of a Jay Ward character, you're really saying something!  As DVD packaging become ever cheaper, this is one of the BEST efforts in DVD packaging I've seen of late - the Rocky art notwithstanding.

Content Notes:  A double-sided, color page of Content Notes is provided inside the package.  Consider that certain contemporary Warner animation collections have done away with content notes entirely, and you can appreciate this effort all the more.

Menu and Navigation:  Menu navigation is very easy.  BIG NUMBERS represent the ""number of the episode"", and there is a full screen description of the contents of each episode for you to read before selecting it. This is especially helpful in that you won't mistakenly play the show with ""Chapters 3 and 4"" of a ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" serial, when you intend to play the show with ""Chapters 5 and 6"".  You can also play individual cartoons, or the episode as a whole.

The Talent:  Producers Jay Ward and Bill Scott.  Voice actors June Foray, Bill Scott, Paul Frees (who steals every show as ""Boris Badenov""), William Conrad as ""Our Narrator"", Edward Everett Horton, Daws Butler, Walter Tetley, Hans Conreid, and Charlie Ruggles put on a tour-de-force in every episode.

Show Content and Interstitials:  Oddly, for this FOURTH SEASON, they appear to use the original First Season opening and closing sequences (with the music substitutions and faux-Conrad voice).  And, for the First Season set, they used a LATER opening and closing made for ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS.  Go figure. By this time, it should be THE BULLWINKLE SHOW credits anyway.  As I said: ""cobbled together"".

Each show contains two chapters of the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" serial, two component features (""Peabody's Improbably History"", ""Fractured Fairy Tales"", ""Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties"", or ""Aesop and Son"" - adding to the mixed up nature of reconstructing the series), a short Bullwinkle segment (""Bullwinkle's Corner"" or ""Mr. Know-It-All"") and program interstitials that were used to introduce commercials and component features.  You all remember ""Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit of out of my Hat!""?  Yeah, that stuff - and more of it than I remember there being, back in the day.  Great to have those!

Shorter Serials:  Though I always loved this show, I often felt less than satisfied because - no matter when I seemed to watch it - I only felt as if I were getting PART OF SOMETHING, instead of a ""full-story"".  The first serial ""Jet Fuel Formula"" (on the Season One DVD) was a whopping 40 (!) parts long!  Imagine today's kids hanging in that long for ANYTHING.

Of course, as I grew older and wiser, I realized that a ""complete story"" was not the point of the R&B serials - and that ""getting there was ALL of the fun""!

Though, perhaps in response to this, the serials by this time were anywhere from FOUR to EIGHT chapters (with one 12-part exception) - and would cover anywhere from two to four shows. Honestly, I think it works better this way.

The Humor:  If Jay Ward has one lasting legacy, it is the HUMOR of his animated series. He stuffed them full of great jokes and satire and, when they were chock full, he stuffed them some more.

Here are FOUR examples from ""SHOW # 3"" alone:

Boris Badenov (...such a great joke in itself) realizes he's just made a terrible mistake.

BORIS:  ""GOOD HEAVENS!""

NATASHA (aghast): ""BORIS!  YOU SAID HEAVENS!""

BORIS:  ""WHAT CAN I DO?  THEY WON'T LET ME PLUG THE COMPETITION!""

Turns out, though, that they DID plug the competition - in these next two examples.

Boris ends a chapter by making a BET with the Narrator - who announces the title of the next chapter as ""Dollars to Donuts - or The Wonderful World of Cruller"" (The Disney Sunday program that followed ""The Bullwinkle Show"" on NBC.

Or, in a ""Fractured Fairy Tale"", one character suspiciously accuses another thusly:  ""What are you, a spy from Hanna-Barbera?""

And, in what may have been the ""Groaner of the Year"", an ""R&B"" chapter satirized ""Modern Art"".

NARRATOR: ""JACKSON PLOP PAINTED WITH A MIXTURE OF PABLUM AND CHICKEN GIZZARDS!""

ART CRITIC: ""WELL, THERE'S ONE THING YOU'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT BOY'S WORK - IT'S GOT GUTS!""

...Oh, how do you not love that!  And all of this is in just ONE SHOW!

 Overall:  Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends: The Complete Season Four is a great package, as long as you're understanding of its shortcomings in the area of authenticity.  Again, I'm not certain the true authentic experience CAN be recreated, so I'm willing to accept it as is.

It doesn't matter if you have the earlier season sets, as this is a fine sampling of Jay Ward's greatest creations.

Hokey Smoke, just buy it and enjoy it!",1284940800,14,8436,4.807933194154488
4155334,3,B003M9ZAC4,"The first 3 dvd box sets were released with Jay Ward's Widow's supervision which meant, she only wanted the second season's main titles on EVERY SINGLE SEASON as well as changing ""The Bullwinkle Show"" to have new CGI graphics as well as a new narration in the style of Bill Conrad. Now that she's died, have they gone to the original aired titles without the bastardization?",1284595200,,374,4.681818181818182
4155335,5,B003M9ZAC4,After a long wait season 4 is finally available and worth the wait.  The only downside is the packaging is different than the first 3 seasons.,1284336000,,142,4.461538461538462
4155336,5,B003M9ZAC4,"After a three year hiatus since the release of season three, here at last is season four on DVD. And well worth the wait. Here are nineteen shows on two one-sided discs, in an attractive package that opens like a book. There are no special features, but each show consists of two episodes of Moose and Squirrel, as well as rotating segments including ""Peabody and Sherman"", ""Dudley Do-Right"", ""Aesop and Son"", ""Fractured Fairy Tales"", ""Mr. Know-It-All"", and ""Bullwinkle's Corner"".

But the best part is that the more than twenty-five various openings, closings, commercial lead-ins, and ""bumpers"" are well-represented here. So whether you remember ""Hey Rock, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!"" or ""Bullwinkle is a dope"", that childhood memory is likely on here. The show ran in various formats and under different titles, beginning with ""Rocky and His Friends"" on its ABC debut in 1959. It ran on NBC in 1961 as the ""Bullwinkle Show"". Little flags reading ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends"", the title of the show when syndicated, have been inserted into some of the closing segments on these shows.

The recent penchant of studios to make classic cartoons into forgettable live-action movies notwithstanding, these shows have held up great. The simple, clean, whimsical late '50s design ethic and witty writing still outstrip the bulk of overdone CGI special FX animation and tediously ""extreme"" ""adult"" cartoons. Here are shows the whole family can enjoy, with ""enjoy"" not being an oxymoron. Readily apparent is the influence these cartoons have had on recent animation pioneers, whose own work is a tribute to these early masters, notably Genndy Tartakovsky, in shows like ""Dexter's Laboratory, or the wordplay in ""Pinky and the Brain"". Yet many animation studios have still not caught up with the '50s era of great, clean cartoons. Better get going, folks, you're only about sixty years behind.",1283558400,,1920,5.111464968152866

4155340,5,B003M9ZAC4,"The long wait was worth it.  Anything produced by Jay Ward & Bill Scott on DVD is welcomed by me.

Rocky and Bullwinkle, Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop & Son, Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-It-All, Rocky & Bullwinkle Fan Club, Peabody's Improbable History, and Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties all had a goofy, half-baked, not-takin'-this-too-seriously charm that always keeps me watching.  There was always this dual-layer of humor in these cartoons: the funny pictures and voices to attract the little kids, and the clever, fairly sophisticated humor that got through to older kids and adults.  In one of these episodes seen here, there is a brief scene where a comment is made about how stupid people all seem to congregate on the freeway at 5:00pm everyday.  It's stuff like this that always kept adults watching this show along with little kids.  I love it.

I was five years old when ""Rocky and His Friends"" premiered on TV in 1959.  I was hooked then and loved everything Jay Ward & Bill Scott produced afterward.

I guess it is too much to hope for to get bonus features on some DVDs these days. I am happy to finally see the episodes for Season 4 seen here.  There is one more season yet to be released on DVD.  I hope it comes out within a year.",1282435200,,1251,4.615384615384615
