6075373,1,B00GGQI31A,"Four extremely unlikable women gather in Brazil for a bachelorette party that turns into a bloodbath for reasons so idiotic writer/director/actor Neil Jones would have been better off leaving the killings unmotivated.  Other than some fleeting nudity this movie has nothing whatsoever to recommend it--there's no suspense, the plotting is consistently illogical, the characters are not only annoying as hell but there's little indication on screen that any of them even like each other despite the fact that 3 of them took an expensive flight from Europe to Brazil for the party.  Lead actress Marcia Do Vales has such a thick accent that she probably has no business acting in English.  This is one of those movies where the filmmaker obviously had enough resources at his disposal to make a good film--the tech credits and acting other than Do Vales are all pretty slick--but there's no talent or imagination evident in the finished film.  Avoid.",1390089600,5,948,5.096774193548387
6075374,3,B00GGQI31A,"Four girlfriends go to a secluded villa to have a bachelorette party. Gabby (Marcia Do Vales) is getting married to Michael and aspires to be an actress. Along with Gabby is Mary (Natalia Celino) a reclusive woman who claims to be a virgin, Silvia (Victoria Broom) who joined the mile high club on the way over, and Anna (Tabitha Quitman) who is the most normal in the group.

They hired a stripper for the night. Max, the dog is chained up outside. He bites, except Gabby who grew up with him. There is a locked room and no phone reception. It isn't long before things become unraveled and the blood flows.

This is a slasher film, whose twist I knew before I had any clues. The dialouge was border line. It lacked the humor normally associated with British slasher films. There are better slashers out there.
