This movie is very dramatic, so if you don't like drama, don't waste your time.  I hear the book is good too, maybe I will read it someday!",1362182400,,244,4.239130434782608
8492377,5,B0064418S4,"if you read the book, like the circus, enjoy a writer who has done there homework, this is the movie for you.  I have watched numerous times.",1358553600,,141,4.222222222222222
