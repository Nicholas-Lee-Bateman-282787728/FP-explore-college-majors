7909530,2,B00000I4QM,I am a moderatly experienced woodworker and I found this video fairly interesting but limited even for the begining woodworker.  It leaves out many important steps in woodworking.  This tape should be a freebe for people who buy a Shop Smith.  It seems geared more toward demonstrating the Shop Smith than a teaching tool.  I do not recommend this tape if you are experienced enough to know the difference between a rip cut and a cross cut!,1270771200,,440,4.675324675324675
