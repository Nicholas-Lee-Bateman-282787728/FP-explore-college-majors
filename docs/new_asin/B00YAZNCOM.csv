8717811,2,B00YAZNCOM,"Jonathan Woodley (King Wesley) is a star football player. His family leeches off of him. When he is accused of killing his girlfriend, things are set in motion as the film examines the past of his representatives and the weird relationships in Woodley's family. Blackmail and infidelity.

The film was low budget. The sound was second rate. The acting ranged from bad to so-so. The film ran a bunch of stuff about a past murder and a casino and old drug dealers, etc, that it made it confusing when you are trying to cover a murder case. And if someone at an agency was having an affair, would this really be major sports news? Who would really care? I am sure it goes on all the time.

Guide: F-bomb, implied sex. No nudity.",1440806400,,725,4.443609022556391
8717812,4,B00YAZNCOM,"Saw this film at a screening in Detroit...really good indie flick. Well written, which becomes obvious once you know the creator is an author and playwright. A bit out of the realm of films I usually watch (mainly horror), but always like to support up-and-comers, which is what the guy who made this is for sure - he's not just making movies to be a star - there is message and craft on display here, and he's done a good job getting talented people to believe in him.",1438473600,,469,4.340909090909091
