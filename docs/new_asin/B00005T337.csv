7953344,5,B00005T337,Jenn Carman is my favorite firm instructor but I have to admit that I also enjoyed the others on the dvd. This workout combined all the other firm workout dvd's that I have into one workout. The bar bell workout was fun...so where do I buy  one with the 5 lb weights on each end? :D,1346976000,2,282,4.035714285714286
7953345,5,B00005T337,"Another great parts workout from the Firm - this one contains elements of both Super Cardio and Super Sculpting.  You get the instructors and exercises from these two dvd's combined in such a way that you get a true AWT effect. There's some good toning throughout, though not as much as Super Sculpting alone gives you. Every major muscle group is hit at least once and some a few times. There is an adequate ab section and a short stretch, the emphasis is all on the action in this one.  I recommend this for days when you want to hit the muscles AND get some cardio in without too much of either.  Just about a nice 50 - 50 split, as the name suggests.",1265587200,2,654,4.258064516129032
7953346,5,B00005T337,This workout is divided into two parts -- 24 minutes of lower body and 27 minutes of upper body; you can do each part separately or do them both together.  This is an interval-style workout -- cardio training following by strength training.  It's a good solid workout as one would expect from the Firm!,1173657600,2,302,4.574074074074074
7953347,5,B00005T337,"this workout is divided into upper and lower body segments. It is mostly weight training but don't worry, you are getting a cardio effect. Good for intermediates to advanced,beginners will need to start out slow. All the instructors are good and the time flies. Recommended.",1121299200,3,274,5.111111111111111
7953348,4,B00005T337,"I wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I purchased this video, but I knew that I enjoyed many of the other FIRM workouts and figured this one would be no different!  I have to say, it definitely lived up to its reputation.
This video is split into two sections--one which focuses on the lower body, and one which focuses on the upper body.  Each one is approximately 20-30 minutes long.  You can either do each half on alternating days, or do the full workout.  I like the versatility this offers.
You'll need several pieces of equipment for this video....a box to step up on, ankle weights (if you desire them), and a barbell, although I substitute putting weights on my shoulders, which works just as well.
I'm really impressed with the lower body segment, and use it often.  True to the packaging, it's not so much of a toning workout as a cardio one.  It REALLY gets your heartrate up there!  I am not really sold on the upper body portion, although if you're aiming to do the whole workout at once, it's nice to have ab work early on in the upper body portion to rest a bit from the cardio work.  If you're just looking to do the upper half, though, it's kind of annoying.
Overall, however, I would recommend this video to anyone for a substantial cardio workout that also helps you to tone major muscle groups.  It's a must for any FIRM exerciser's collection!",1076976000,10,1377,4.4541832669322705
7953349,4,B00005T337,"This is a decent compilation video, although I'm not familiar with the Firm workouts it's compiled from.  I own most of the other Firm tapes, and this one has slightly more updated music and outfits, and some of the moves are unlike those in other tapes (curtsey lunges, planks, and hover leg-presses, for example).  Definitely good for variety.
The tape is in two segments:  a 24-minute lower body workout followed by a 27-minute upper body workout, which can be done together or on alternating days.  You defnitely work your legs to fatigue in the first segment, and heavy weights mean the same for the second.  I'm not sure if I like this better than alternating upper/lower, as in other Firm workouts, but it's nice for doing shorter workouts on alternating days.
The first workout starts with a warm up and brief stretch, then goes into squats, lunges, leg presses, etc.  Although the workout is light on cardio segments, my heartrate stayed well within my target zone throughout this segment.  The back of the box doesn't mention it, but you need ankle weights for a short series of standing thigh work.  You'll also need a 12""-14"" step for the leg presses and a shorter step (4""-8"").  You finish this segment with a very brief cool down, but if you're continuing to the next segment, you can just keep your movements bigger.
The second workout starts with a very brief warm up.  Then it moves into ab work on the floor, which I thought was awkward -- I'd prefer to do abs at the end, so my heartrate stays elevated.  The ab work is decent, but not too strenuous.  Then follow cardio and sculpting intervals, and you'll need a fair amount of equipment:  2 lb. ball or dumbell and at least two sets of weights, plus an optional 10-lb. barbell.  I use heavy weights in place of the barbell and a dumbell instead of the ball, and it works fine.  The box says you also need a board, but I have no idea why.  The workout ends with a quirky cool down sort of stretching sequence, but I skip that and do my own stretches.
Like some other Firm tapes, this one emphasizes some muscles a little more than others.  The back and shoulders are worked very well, as are the glutes.  Biceps, triceps, abs, and inner/outer thighs get a little work (use heavy poundage to make these better).  There is no chest work except some inclined pushups, however, and I do wish they had some of the targeted toning for the rear that's on other tapes.
Overall, this tape is on par with Maximum Body Shaping or Time Crunch Workout for intensity.  It's not a beginner tape at all, though, or even a tape for those new to the Firm.  The moves are unusual, cuing is fast, and you have to change equipment very quickly.  I'd recommend this tape only for those familiar with Firm workouts who want a little variety.",1052352000,21,2788,4.534
