2769050,5,B000NIVND2,"I now have 11 of Leslie Sansone's videos and I love every one of them. She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace. I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!! Please do yourself a huge favor and get started walking away the pounds today. Or just do it to be healthier. Either way, you come out a winner!!!",1235433600,58,917,3.882978723404255
2769051,5,B000NIVND2,"This is a great DVD!  The 3 mile is challenging enough, and the 4 mile amps it up even more!  I like that Leslie uses the same four moves because I hate memorizing ""dance steps"".  I can zone out to this DVD and not have to think about what I'm doing.  I also like that this is a more ""professional"" DVD than her weight ball DVDs.  She can get a bit annoying with the talk talk talk, but I don't think she's too bad.  My only word of caution is that the stretchie band gave me some trouble because I have carpal tunnel.  I do it without the band and just use the other arm moves.",1229126400,2,578,3.9310344827586206
2769052,4,B000NIVND2,"So far I've been very happy with every Leslie Sansonne DVD I've bought and this one is no exception. Her workouts are vigorous, get the heart rate up and are easy to follow. Don't be fooled by ""distance."" You get a great workout whether it's one mile or five miles.",1206662400,7,265,4.32
2769053,3,B000NIVND2,"This is the first Leslie Sansome workout DVD I bought. I couldn't get over the fact that she wouldn't shut up! I've done the 3 mile a few times, and do it on mute. Sure, she's encouraging, but a whole hour of saying the same stuff? Come on.. anyway, I like that the moves are easy. I throw it in my rotation of workout DVDs when I don't want to think about what I'm doing. It does get boring though, but it's a nice moderate/low intensity workout. I find it a little awkward to do the band while walking in place, but I guess that's the whole point of the DVD. Overall, it's not my favorite, but it's a n easy enough workout video I could give to my younger sisters as well as my mom to try; especialy when it's too cold to walk outside.",1204416000,,737,4.054794520547945
2769054,5,B000NIVND2,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-the-Pounds-Express-Miles-3-4-with-Stretchie/dp/B000NIVND2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds - Express - Miles 3 & 4 with Stretchie</a>I'm writing this review because of the reviews connected with this item are expremely misleading. I think the reviews for other Leslie Sansone 3 mile DVDs got mixed up with this one.
This DVD contains two complete exercise routines, one 3 mile and one 4 mile. The 3 mile uses the stretchy band during the third mile for strength training. There are six exercises using the band which strenthens the arms (including triceps), shoulders, chest and back.  The second walk is the 4 mile and it does not use the stretchy or any weights, it is aerobic walk, not a strenthening one. If the other reviews had told me this, I could have saved money. Since I exercise six days a week and you're not supposed to strength train the same muscles every day, I also brought a 3 mile DVD without strength training. I could have saved the money and just done the first three miles of the 4 mile walk. BTW, some reviewers have commented about not having a warm up or cool down when you do a shorter walk. If you want a shorter walk, start at the beginning so you'll have the warm up included, do the one or two mile section and then use the ""next"" button on your DVD remote to jump to the cool down stretching section. On this DVD, the miles are not divided into DVD ""chapters but there is a chapter division right before the stretching, so just use the ""next"" button to jump to the stretching after you finish walking.
One of the misleading reviews kept talking about a ""Mary Kay"" I had no clue who she was from this DVD. ""Mary Kay"" is not on this DVD, so disregard any review that mentions her.  I hope this helps.",1201392000,42,1858,4.858044164037855
2769055,5,B000NIVND2,"Leslie Sansone videos are never a disappointment. She always delivers an effective but safe workout. The elastic band is an added bonus which can be used in any of her workouts. Whether you are a beginner or advanced, these DVD's will get you and keep you in good shape. Everyone participating is cheerful, excited about exercising and the moves are simple but challenging. Leslie's videos are easy to follow unlike many other fitness instructors who are more into fast paced dance moves that only young, athletic types can master.",1195257600,8,531,4.977528089887641
2769056,5,B000NIVND2,"This DVD gave me a great workout.  I have a lot of Leslie's DVD's and I like this one so far the best.  My daugther, who is very athletic, thought it was great too.  There was just enough work with the stretchie band.  Anymore and my arms would have fallen off!!  I would recommend this to anyone.",1191283200,10,297,4.140350877192983
2769057,3,B000NIVND2,"I own Leslie Sansome's Walk Away the Pounds 1, 2, and three mile walks with weights (they use weighted balls, but I use regular hand weights).  I liked the DVD's I had used of this system so far because they are easy to do and yet effective for boosting my metabolism.  Since I am 45 and not really an athelete, they are good for me.  I got this one because I wanted to try using the stretchie with the system for a different kind of workout.  The Stretchie is a rubber resiestance band used for strengthening.  The stretchie is only used in the three mile walk and even then for only about ten minutes.  I wanted it for a bit more than that.  I still like Leslie Sansome's Walk Away the Pounds system because its easy to do and yet effective.  However, this DVD is misleading advertising because it really doesn't use the stretchie much or tell you much about how you could use it.  I still think I will use this DVD for excercise though and maybe I will figure out how to use the stretchie on my own.",1184716800,20,1002,4.231578947368421

2769066,5,B000NIVND2,"I have been doing the 1 and 2 mile DVD for a long time and I finally moved on to the 3 mile.  Leslie's workouts are easy to follow and she is always so encouraging and fun.  You can tell that she loves what she does.  It really is fun to work out with her.  I highly recommend her workouts.  The 3 mile is definitely more challenging than the 2 mile, but she teaches you to pace yourself so you can make it all the way through.  LOVE it.  :)",1391126400,2,441,3.8333333333333335

2769068,5,B000NIVND2,"I have several of Leslie Sansone DVDs and love them all, but this one is one of my favorites and is why I purchased this one for my sister. She is in love with it also and uses it everyday. Its great because you get out of it what you put into it and you can always stop when you have had enough. Its fun and upbeat and keeps you moving with no real difficult movements. I even have my 61 yr old mom using Leslie's DVDs daily.",1377561600,2,426,3.852272727272727

2769070,5,B000NIVND2,"I lost 60 lbs using Walk Away the Pounds combined with walking, hiking, bicycling - but Walk Away the Pounds is what I started with. She got me energized and more fit so I could go out there and be more active. I started with the simple 15 minute 1 mile, then gradually worked up from there.",1358985600,2,291,4.12280701754386

2769073,5,B000NIVND2,"I have been using Leslie's other videos daily for about 2 years. I have lost weight, gained strength, coordination and balance, and really toned my arms especially. This DVD gives variety to your program using the bands. I use a different video every day and I am never bored. I would recommend her videos to everyone because even beginners can modify the walking steps to their level. It is like working out with a friend!",1357344000,2,423,4.653333333333333

2769075,5,B000NIVND2,"I love the fast pace of these two workouts, and some of the music is really fun (other songs are her more standard music that just gives you a good beat to move too).  Leslie's workouts are so simple to adjust to make work for you.  The fast pace of this workout makes it easy to turn walking into jogging every once in awhile.  I always work up a sweat doing either of these walks.  My only complaint is that the last miles REALLY slow down almost right away.  The 3 mile's slow down, to me, isn't as noticeable because of the stretchy band work, but the last mile of the 4 mile workout seems to drag on - my heart rate is almost normal with more than 1/2 a mile to go.  I'm still giving it 5 stars because I, like I said before, can make adjustments to get my heart rate up.
(I always find it helpful to get an idea of the reviewer's fitness level when it comes to workout videos, so here's mine:  I'm 40 years old, exercise daily for 45-60, former non-contact kickboxing instructor who got tired of the constant little injuries from high- impact workouts. I'm well on my way getting back into shape after my last injury that took along time to heal.  I'm loving how easy Leslie's workouts are on my body while still getting my heart rate up and making me sweat!)",1356048000,,1265,4.219917012448133
2769076,5,B000NIVND2,"The band is not used in the 4 mile - the band is used in the 3 mile.

I loved the 4 mile!

This 4 mile walk had terrific walking music, Leslie was at her prime in teaching.  Some of the movements in this that are not in others are forward side step which is a nice change, forward and back knee-up which you feel, side step tap which is relaxing and you should stretch that tap to get more out of it, and the grapevine at the end is a long, nice stretch because Leslie talks quite a bit.  I'm not complaining about her talking though because it's all motivational and encouraging.  She tells you about different body parts and what you're working on which is nice.  I love the way she mentioned everyone's name and the fact that the ages were all over the board from 20's to 70's.  At the 24 minute mark you get to meet 72 year old Elton who is obviously happy to be there and happy to work out.  At the 40 minute mark she mentions 55 year old Carole, a feisty little red head who is 60 lbs down!  (Congratulations Carole!) At the 45 minute mark you meet Linda who is a walk leader and has been helping Leslie lead classes for 23 years.  There are so many other gals I recognize from her other videos and love seeing them all in this video - many of them are obviously walk leaders as well.  The walk is fast and fun.  Each mile mark is shown across the bottom of the screen and averages about 15 minutes.  You don't have to fret if you get out of step, just keep stepping, you can change when it's convenient.  If the camera zooms in on someone who is out of sync - look away and keep marching.  As long as you're moving you'll get a good workout out of this dvd.

 I am 48, I enjoyed this very much and will use it at least once a week in addition to my other videos.

I think this may be the same as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-The-Pounds-Express-Super-Challenge/dp/B0012XRN1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk Away The Pounds: Express Super Challenge</a>

I didn't care for the 3 mile - the music and movements seemed off to me sometimes - the band was used a bit in the 3 mile but if you use it correctly you will feel it.",1354147200,2,2742,5.160633484162896
2769077,2,B000NIVND2,These two workouts are on another DVD that I own.  I was looking for a different routine to give me some variety.,1354147200,,113,4.136363636363637
2769078,1,B000NIVND2,I have NOT received the DVD so I can't rate it.. I don't understand why this DVD never got to me. It's been a year or so but still nothing.,1336867200,,139,3.6666666666666665
2769079,5,B000NIVND2,"This DVD is one of my favorite ""go-to's"" when I can't make up my mind which DVD to choose. I get a good workout without wearing myself out. There are (2) separate workouts each with a warm up and cool down. The group ranges in age from 20's to 70's and acts like they're happy to be there, which I find inspiring.  IMO, the music is better than some of Leslie's other DVD's. The 'stretchie' is used during the 3 mile walk close to the end; it is not used at all during the 4 mile walk. Leslie does talk quite a bit...I don't find it annoying. It isn't one of the hardest, but I feel great after I'm done. You can boost it easily by stepping wider, bigger arm movements, jogging during the walking segments. It's also good for beginners as it is not TOO strenuous. The versatility makes it a good one.",1336262400,2,800,4.194805194805195
2769080,4,B000NIVND2,"Please note the 2nd workout on here doesnt use the stretchie. Also (and I know I have seen comments on this before) but it finally happened to me. I now have the same workout repackaged differently. I have the 1st workout on here in VHS form & it's a green cover. I was hoping the 2nd one was a 4 mile with the stretchie but nope.
I like the workouts especially the 2nd because she uses some new patterns including double kickbacks which I have never seen on her any of the others.
Also the pacing is really nice on the 4 mile so you can get through it! Total time is about 58 minutes. So definitely worth it.",1335744000,2,609,4.126050420168068

2769082,5,B000NIVND2,When I bought this I thought it was 1 workout with 2 options - 3 mile and 4 mile. Actually it is 2 separate workouts. The 3 mile uses the Stretchie band and the 4 mile doesn't but it works at a high calorie burn just the same! As with all my other Leslie Sansone dvds - I LOVE IT!!!,1334707200,,282,3.716666666666667

Sadly, I have another Leslie DVD package that has from 1 to 4 miles and the 3rd and 4th are the same two routines. Oh well. I do like the three-with stretchie band, and the 4 mile challenge. It's Leslie and her gang and there is no 'boosted' walking. Instead it is a heavy duty workout that still has me sweating and feeling I've got a good routine for the day.
