5384887,5,B00A6UAIW4,"Although not in HD, the picture quality and subtitles are very good.  It is a beautiful love story well worth watching and having in your DVD library.  The story is based on the relationship between King Sukjong, of the Joseon Dynasty, and Consort Suk (Dong Yi), and told with plenty of court intrigue, humor, sentimental moments, beautiful costumes and well researched sets.  The characters are brought to life through superb acting.  It is a well presented rendering of how a poor common girl wins the heart of the King and becomes the mother of future Korean kings.  Delightful!",1373068800,3,581,4.887755102040816
5384888,3,B00A6UAIW4,"the picture is good but not HQ, it seems blurry or out of focus sometimes and it's not in widescreen (16.9). The subtitles are very good, if the picture was HQ and in widescreen it would be the perfect set.",1370995200,4,206,4.175
5384889,5,B00A6UAIW4,It was a beautiful story line. It had great acting as well as great actors.  It draws you in.  The subtitles were excellent I was able to follow the story line.,1369699200,5,160,4.129032258064516

8547170,5,B00A6UAIW4,"I bought the 'economic' MBC version of this drama from Poh Kim (Singapore) and am satisfied with its very good picture quality, excellent English translation (There were only not more than a handful of negligible spelling or grammatical errors), beautiful dresses and furniture, nice theme song, and the morals of the story. Having previously watched Dae Jang Geum aka Jewel in the Palace, my whole family think Dong Yi is better. Like Dae Jang Geum, it has the sad and funny parts. However, unlike Dae Jang Geum, It is more quick-paced, has various places shown in the film (Jang Geum's first season was spent mostly in the kitchen or about meals) and has more romantic parts. The performance of the actors/actress playing the King (Officer Min Jio Ho of Dae Jang Geum), Lady Jang and Prince Yeong-In are especially superb. The only down sides are: 1) The performance of the actress playing Dong Yi is not as strong as the one playing Jang Geum; and 2) it has too many unnecessary flashbacks. Most of those flashbacks replayed parts which were shown only a few seconds before (!). Without those extravagant flashbacks, the film may finish in episode 57 rather than 60. I think those flashbacks were placed to enable the director to end all episodes (except just one or two) showing Dong Yi's close-up face in a certain expression. But overall this is a great TV series worth buying or collecting. If you like Dae Jang Geum, you will like this one too.",1421452800,,1452,4.743083003952569
8547171,5,B00A6UAIW4,"GREAT story.  Both of us like it, good plot and story.",1414886400,,54,3.909090909090909
8547172,4,B00A6UAIW4,"This imperfect. Too many flashbacks, perhaps jang hee bin is presented as too emotionally attached to the king,and her child/children which is just a bit too far from the chronicles. Her brother is a bit too irritating in his choice of evil smiling shark but!
Ji Jin portrays the king as delightful charming funny and thoroughly likable, also a bit far from the truth but more enjoyable. And of course dong yi is played unrealistic ally charming and clever and delightful and innocent. E subordinate characters are stunning. Seo and Cha are great, believable, delightfully underplayed. My daughter and I are enjoying this as much as Dae Chang Geum but in a lighter spirit. I appreciate the underplay of sex, the careful portrayal of blood so she is not scared. Delightful worth the money.",1391731200,,788,4.888059701492537
8547173,5,B00A6UAIW4,"beautiful costumes. beautiful women. there's nonstop action. never boring. always something interesting happening.
great music too. there's something for everybody here. but it will take a long time to complete the series, about
60 episodes.  Hollywood has nothing over South Korea when it comes to drama. they're the king of dramas.",1377734400,5,333,5.529411764705882

8547175,2,B00A6UAIW4,"I was very disappointed with this product. So much so that I had to return it to the seller for a refund. I am rating this as a 2, instead of a 1, only because the seller was responsive and wanted to ensure my satisfaction. However, a bad product is a bad product -- regardless of the seller. Specifics follow.

The product arrived timely and the packaging protected the product nicely. However, upon trying to play any of the 15 included discs, I found the video quality to be poor, i.e., most of the objects, including actors, were visibly fuzzy. Not even up to standard television broadcast quality. DVDs normally return at least 480dpi, and usually considerably higher. None of the discs in this set even approached that modest standard. What made the product even more unacceptable was the inability of any of the discs to show both lines of the English subtitles; I had to guess at what the second line was trying to say.

Upon corresponding with the seller, he offered to make a replacement. But, after considerable discussion about quality, and emails back and forth, he said he could not guarantee a replacement product would be any better, as the replacement product he had on hand was produced by the same manufacturer and licensee. He then e-mailed a shipping label to be put on top of the original label; the return costs were borne by him. He then offered a credit refund to my credit card, which I accepted. Thus, I am satisfied with the seller, but extremely dissatisfied with the product.

After reading reviews of this, and other Dong Yi products from other licensees and sellers, it appears video quality and English subtitle problems are widespread. Getting a good product seems to be just pure luck.

Finally, I should say that viewing a HD broadcast of this program, one week at a time, over the air, from MBC D, Channel 018-03, in Los Angeles, is superb! So, to me, that proves that the problem lies in the licensed products. At this point, unless someone knows of a reliably good product to buy, I will have to wait, week by week, to see the end of this spectacular series -- on broadcast TV.",1376697600,4,2116,4.61968085106383
8547176,5,B00A6UAIW4,"I saw this when it was on the Korean channel and thought it was really good. After each weeks showing it had me wondering how Dong Yi was going to get out of the situation she found herself in. I enjoyed it enough that I wanted to be able to see it again so, I purchased the set and did watch it a second time. Since I do not speak Korean, I really appreciate the job done with the subtitles. Anyone who enjoys the Korean dramas depicting a time long gone, should enjoy this one too.",1373241600,6,483,4.041666666666667
