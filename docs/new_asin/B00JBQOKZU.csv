8649649,4,B00JBQOKZU,"I tried to purchase this item when it was originally released however it was sold out. If you are looking to complete your Blu-Ray collection of this series, try to see if you can get if for less than $90. However, being that there are not too many of these discs out in the wild you may want to purchase this one as soon as you see it is available, otherwise if you wait you may see some places selling this disc for as high as $250.

As far as the last episode to end the series, I was disappointed with the way it ended however others may find it to be a fitting end to this series which IMO was some of the best animation put together in a Gundam Series. The series also had a great soundtrack which motivated me to purchase the four volumes of soundtrack made available.",1450569600,,775,4.132450331125828

8649652,5,B00JBQOKZU,"The grand finale is here, does it end the OVA and a high note?

Being a 90 minute episode there is a lot here and it is strong content. The content itself being the conclusion is well paced and the ideaological conflict the Universal Century timeline is famous for is here as well. You do get major deaths as I am not into spoilers I am not going to give it.. The story concludes the Zeon wars very well as this is pretty much all Zeon has left. Also the action scenes are throughout as they are riveting and very well animated. You also get cameos from lesser known mechs from the older shows. The final bout with Full Frontal is purely fantastic and well developed spectacle. It was not about the conflict between him and Banagher but between whose plan would work better. This was well done. As well as the special cameos (audio and some images only of older characters.) The music for the episode was well fitted for the episode and the series itself it is befitting of an epic and does portray a sense of finality.

The characters while not the best are at their highest point but you do see who got the short end of the stick (the conspiracy and Riddhe). The newtype goings on in this series occur will put off people as not working but I disagree... I think it works with the fictional universe.",1408060800,,1302,4.3539094650205765

8649656,5,B00JBQOKZU,"There's nothing but good things to say about this series even if it took years to make (seriously, they had me hooked from the first episode over five years ago.) That said, it's good to see this show wrap up with a great ending that leaves the viewer to imagine what might happen next. There's a good balance of action and politics in this one which was a big seller to me, it makes you think a little which more anime needs. The only thing I could ask more of is that epic soundtrack that needs to be released in more countries, I can't get enough of it. And Lastly if you like the Unicorn Gundam, it may be of interest to check out Gundam Warriors Reborn as it has a DLC in which you get to pilot that suit.",1404432000,4,710,4.078571428571428
