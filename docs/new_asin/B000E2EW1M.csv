You don't really see death as much as you do in those other works.  I think a child could watch this and not realize what happened to Captain Ahab.

Moby Dick itself doesn't appear until far into the flick.  He's shown with many a harpoon in his back and that's one way in which this is graphic.  You don't see him challenging the ship as often as you do in other films.  In fact, you see sharks twice, much more than in other films.

Usually, MOby Dick flicks have two men of color: Queequeg and maybe one other.  This flick had men of color from all regions: Polynesian, African, Native American, East Asian, Arab, and Asian Indian.  However, they have few lines.  This film lacked Pip, the Black youth that's in most of the other films.  Here, Ishmael is the male thrown off a boat and almost doomed by a shark.

Part of me wonders why this isn't on DVD, but I can guess why.  Children of today are probably used to Pixar, Disney movies, and recent animation with big budgets.  This was made in that cheap 1960s style like the old Spiderman cartoons.  It may be too dull for today's youngsters.  However, if young folk like cartoons no matter what the cartoon, then maybe they'll sit and watch.  I personally own a VCR, but many of today's parents might not.  If teachers have VCRs in their elementary or junior high schools, then they could probably show this on a lazy day or day before the holidays or something.",1348358400,,1561,4.414035087719299
