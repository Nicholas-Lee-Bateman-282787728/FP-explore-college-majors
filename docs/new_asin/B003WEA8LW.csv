8407299,2,B003WEA8LW,"Seems like the video does not live up to its potential.  I thought this was going to be a look at reenacting the Napoleanic Wars period of history, but starts to meander across the hobby.  Taken along with its following video ""Living History"", this should have been compressed into one single video with better editing.  Some reenactor interviews could have been deleted entirely, others shortened, while others given more time.",1401840000,,428,5.085714285714285
8407300,1,B003WEA8LW,"I wish I could have given this ""documentary"" zero stars.

1.) The span of interviews was narrow, the majority were officers who gave very little input concerning the hobby as whole. Not only was the distribution of interviews one sided, there was no continuity. As a member of the reenacting community for 22 years , I have found that it is a rich mix of characters, stories, and good times. This did not come across in this work at all.

2.) The ""filmmaker"" that dePas claims to be is not obvious in his work. It seems as if there was very little thought or planning that went into the production of this project. From the finished work it is clear that there is a lack of lighting, knowledge of frame set up, over-arcing story/message, and lack of planning on the whole.

I would not recommend this to anyone who has any interest in the hobby what so ever. Go to an event! You'll get 100 times greater enjoyment than you probability will watching this work.",1396051200,,959,4.468571428571429
8407301,5,B003WEA8LW,"Notwithstanding that I briefly appear in it, Maurice dePas (a celebrity in his own right -- look it up) has crafted what is the best documentary ever to tell the story of not only a relatively small segment of the Living History community, but of all reenactors collectively.
Done with grace, charm, and appreciation for those who call themselves ""Living Historians"", and not the usual condescending or pandering look at ""silly folks in fancy dress"".
This is a masterpiece for anyone wishing an inside look at what it means to ""bring history to life"".
To top it off, the soundtrack is by maestro Maurice himself, performing what I believe to be THE best version of ""Over The Hills And Far Away"" yet recorded.

A must have for everyone's library, for those who have wanted to be, ever wondered about, or are just curious, of the wonderful world of reenacting and historical reenactors.

8407303,5,B003WEA8LW,"A great film, documenting the lives and activities of some of the reenacting world's who's-who.  A must see for those at all interested in or involved in reenactments.  Is a wonderful look into this mysterious world.  Through Maurice's lens we are shown the splendor of the troops and officers, how they live, how they fight, great scenes and descriptions.  Tremendous footage that has to be seen, like you are there and part of a battle or a conversation.  Even has a section introducing us to some of the more familiar and notable sutlers and those that make reenacting more enjoyable for the rest us us.  It is easy to see that great care was taken in the filming and making of this film, it is a piece of the director that will stay with you for some time, no collection should be without this visually stunning and expertly filmed presentation, a must see!",1284076800,3,861,4.594771241830065
