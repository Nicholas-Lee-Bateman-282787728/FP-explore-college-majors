8607433,5,B00DVFI3S2,"To be clear, this set is in PAL not NTSC. They will not normally play in regular DVD players here in the states. The 2 ways I watch this is through either of my computers. The DVD burners in computers are not regulated like the players so they will play the PAL format with no problem. (Well, at least mine do- I have an HP Pavilion desktop and a Toshiba laptop). I rip the DVD's and save it to the HDD so I can watch it on my Playmedia server through my 2 Roku's I have in my home. My Toshiba laptop also has a HDMI jack so I can connect it directly to my bigscreen TV and watch them that way as well. Sure, you can try hacking the DVD players, etc but I simply don't have time for that. I'm quite satisfied at the setup I have. Ok, enough of that. The DVDs are great. The sights and sounds of the James Last Orchestra are truly wonderful and are well presented. Extremely happy and satisfied I purchased these and they arrived in around a couple weeks via regular mail from the UK. Kudos once again to the seller.",1386115200,,1015,4.08
