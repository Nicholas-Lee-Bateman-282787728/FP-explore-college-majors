I also have a tape of the original mini series on t.v. and the DVD has all of it.  There is no excuse for butchering a movie like this.",1522454400,,249,3.641509433962264

7798734,5,1574927329,Well worth the money to purchase one of my favorite movies. Glad I didn't give away my old VCR since Only Love comes on a VHS tape rather than on a DVD.,1283040000,,152,3.78125
7798735,5,1574927329,A wonderful love story.......I cried and cried. The characters were very real. It beats Bridges of Madison County.,1248134400,,114,5.388888888888889
7798736,4,1574927329,"Based on a romance novel by Erich Segal, this Hallmark's film is about a doctor (Rob Morrow from the series NUMB3RS))who meet his former lover after several years and has to deal with the reality of having her as his patient (Mathilda May) as she has a brain tumor. They had met for the first time in Amsterdam where they were chosen to work in a mission in Africa helping the poor people of a country at war. It's easy to follow even though you'll be watching it for around 175 minutes. Filmed in Holland, Italy, South Africa, France besides the New York from 1998. It is outdated in the medical side, technologically speaking for today's standards, but it does not mind. Pay attention to the emocional side. Marisa Tomei is Morrow's long-time friend, always near during good and bad times. I am not sure if Amazon can have again a stock of this DVD for the Region 1, but it is worth a new release.",1220832000,2,899,4.421686746987952
7798737,2,1574927329,"Well, well, well, if I didn't read the book first, maybe I would have had diferent opinion on this movie. But I think the way they end the movie did total injustice to the original story of the book. Correct me if I am wrong but the impression I got from the book was that Evie was his true love from the beginning and it was his realization of that and finally being free from his obseession over Silvia made it possible for him to find the music again.

In movie, they end it the way make you think that Silvia was his true love then and now and her love and his grief over her death made him find his lost music. They made it look like Evie is second best after all. Wrong, wrong, wrong way to interpret teh book.

I know you have to look at the book and the movie seperately but since I like the book a lot, I am really dissapointed they way they filmed it. I almost feel cheated...

If you didn't read the book and wondering what I am talking about, all you need to do is go and read the final three chapters. I much rather prefer book's ending than the movie version.",1109635200,2,1073,4.05188679245283
7798738,5,1574927329,I loved this movie.  The acting was wonderful as well as the setting!  Be prepared to get a bit weepy though.  I highly recommend this movie if you like love stories!,1108684800,2,166,4.290322580645161
7798739,3,1574927329,"This movie could have been done so much better. It had potential, but seems almost like it was just rushed through. It ends up leaving many rough edges that ruin much of the movie. HOWEVER, men especially, it is well worth it just to see Marisa Tomei's performance, which is extraordinarily endearing. Another reviewer said she is so cute, I agree, but would say that is an understatement. I believe most men will leave this movie yearning to be with ""Evie"" themselves.",1097712000,,469,4.7317073170731705
7798740,5,1574927329,"I saw this movie other day, here in Brazil,and I loved it. The story is wonderful and shows how love can be unexpected. We can't know who loved more... .The story between Sylvia and Mathew shows that for the true love there are no frontiers. I loved Marisa Tomei also but I would prefer he had finished with his only true love,Sylvia. You should do this great movie in a DVD version also, because of the beautiful images. I wait for a DVD version, including here in Brazil. Congratulations for the americans for this beautiful story!!",1006041600,8,534,4.572916666666667
7798741,5,1574927329,"Maybe it was because I watched this movie before I ever saw Love Story, but this movie is much more powerful than Love Story-or any other love story for that matter.  This is my favorite movie of all time.  The plot of forbidden love is not original, but the Rob Morrow and Marissa Tomei's performances more than make up for it. This movie makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and most importantly it makes you love.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a true fan of love stories.",987724800,6,489,4.293478260869565
