2644755,5,B000HWZ4EI,"Very pleased with this collection. One of my favorites is ""The Fountainhead"" which is rare and not seen often on T.V. Worth the money if you are a Gary Cooper fan.",1168473600,5,163,4.290322580645161
2644756,5,B000HWZ4EI,Outstanding collection of hard-to-find Cooper classics.  Belongs in every movie aficionado's library.,1168473600,4,101,7.416666666666667
2644757,4,B000HWZ4EI,"Gary Cooper was the most important screen actor to bridge the gap between silent pictures and the talkies.  As Clint Eastwood, host of the documentary included in this 5-disc set,aaya ""In a time now fast receding, Gary Cooper was the greatest of all movie stars.""  This is indeed true, for Cooper was the the natural precursor to such popular screen giants as James Stewart, Henry Fonda, John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.

This set offers five films from his work at Warner Brothers and MGM ranging from 1941 to 1959. The only real signature performance is

""Sergeant York"" for which he won his first Academy Award as Best Actor.

This is one of his most interesting films in that he appears in almost every scene in its two and a quarter hours running time. Any actor who can hold that amount of screen time and keep the interest of his audience

is an exceptional actor.  His tall, lanky frame and soft spoken drawl made him one of the most watchable of actors. He was the best example of the old maxim ""less is more.""  Most of his dialogue was monosyllabic, but his face spoke volumes.

The second film ""The Fountainhead"" may not be among his best, but it is certainly one of his most intriguing. Playing an idealistic architect, Cooper seems ill-suited to Ayn Rand's wordy and often pretentious script

adapted from her own influential novel, but he turns in a most believable

performance. This is more than can be said for the rest of the cast. That fine actress Patricia Neal is reduced to giveing an over-stated eye-rolling performance that is not at all worthy of her talent. Raymond Massey and Robert Douglas ( both fine actors ) are saddled with some of the worst dialogue of their careers. But Cooper succeeds in shining and rising above the confusion and even handles a six-minute speech with calm conviction. It has to be said,though, that the film is magnificently designed and expertly directed by King Vidor.  ""The Fountainhead"" is an impressive love-it or hate-it picture. The public loved it and the critics hated it.  Without Gary Cooper's towering presence, it would not have succeeded at all.

Of the remaining three pictures, two are Westerns ""Dallas""(1950) and ""Springfield Rifle"" (1952)- a genre in which Cooper was always comfortable, even when the scripts and direction were not top drawer

( which is the case here ). The last is a very well-produced adaptation ( by Eric Ambler ) of the Hammond Innes best-selling novel ""The Wreck of the Mary Deare"" in which Gary Cooper handles a very difficult and strenuous role as a man falsely accused of scuttling a ship for profit. The action sequences at sea are very well staged and the complicated plot is told with commendable clarity.  Cooper is supported by a powerhouse cast of strong actors like Charlton Heston, Michael Redgrave and a young Richard Harris and still succeeds in stealing every scene.  Opinions are divided on whether this is a great picture. Some critics felt it was too waterlogged for its own good.  I disagree. This is a most engrossing thriller with Gary Cooper in top form.

Warners have produced a fine box set here, but I can't help feeling it would have been better if they had included ""Bright Leaf""(1950) -a melodrama of the tobacco industry that teamed him rather intrigingly with Lauren Bacall and again with Patricia Neal - and ""The Hanging Tree"" )1959)

an atmospheric Western far superior to the two included here.

Despite these slight shortcomings, this is a box set that I am proud to add to my collection and, if you want to see a truly great screen actor at work,I recommend that you invest in this set.  You won't be disappointed.",1167609600,19,3642,4.747619047619048
2644758,5,B000HWZ4EI,"So you get five film starring this LEGENDARY ACTOR who never gave a anything but great performances... Even in so-so films, Gary Cooper would shine all over with hos leading style... his easy command of the screen... his magnetic persona... his sincere smile and on-screen will that would drive you love him in any character he portrayed.

In THE FOUNTAINHEAD (my favorite here), Gary gives one of his best performances as Howard Roark, an architect (inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, no less!) who was in a constant battle against mediocre styles. Someone trully creative and visionary who would not compromise. ""I don't build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build!""

But another thing about this film is the eye-popping sets and designs.

INCREDIBLE... I still love that building all made of glass!!!!

In SERGEANT YORK, Gary portrays a pacifist (who is enlisted during WWI) who will discover the true meaning of fighting... and what being a Hero is all about. JOHN HUSTON was one of the screenwriters of this GREAT 1941 film who, I'm sure, did back then much more than just entertain. In fact, this is one of the best Hollywood war films during the 40's...

And, of course, with HOWARD HAWKS, you can never go wrong.

THE WRECK OF THE MARY DEARE is a big CinemaScope film where special effects trully shine. Again, here Gary cooper gives a superlative performance.

SPRINGFIELD RIFLE is a smaller Western by ANDRE DE TOTH with another great performance. Here, Cooper joins (undercover) a group of criminals in order to solve a mystery of stolen guns. This is an above average B-movie with a good script.

DALLAS is a post-Civil War drama of a man returning home to seek revenge. Another B-film with a great performance.

This box is worth buying because of two reasons:

You get five films (three are trully great, two are trully good) for easily the price of just two or three...

...then, why not get them all?",1159056000,59,1934,4.7604790419161676

2644843,3,B000HWZ4EI,"The product is fine - packaging is fine - Amazon service is as awesome as always.  I have just a bit of personal (perhaps petty) irritation over the fact that the marketplace seller left an external price tag on the item.  $19.99 boldly shown on the upper right hand corner of the package....but I paid $34.79.  That's fine - this is a gift for my Dad, and I would have even paid more.  But, for Heaven's sake, remove the old price sticker!  Of course we are all pleased when the price sticker is HIGHER than what we paid, but it's irritating when it's significantly lower.

Other than that, this is a great collection of old Gary Cooper classics.  Sargent York is one of my Dad's all-time favorite movies, and to have a backup copy of that as well as all these other great movies is awesome.

2644844,4,B000HWZ4EI,"The disappointment in this group of films was 'Springfield Rifle'.  It was just a B Western.  The other 3 films were quite good, with solid stories and acting.  There is a good mix of drama, action, and history.  Cooper shows why he was one of the notable male actors of the era.  Further, with the exception of Springfield Rifle, the stories are not the usual inane garbage we see so much of today.

Gary Cooper, The Signature Collection has 5 great movies:

1. Sergeant York: Absolutely the best of the pack which won Academy Awards. Cooper plays Sgt. York, the real life World War One decorated hero, along with his love interest, Joan Leslie, and his preacher, Walter Brennan. Cooper, as Alvin York, is a rowdy Tennessee backswoods man who becomes converted to a born again Christian as he survives a lighting bolt strike while on horseback, and joins Brennan's church. His conversion changes him to a forgiving man who forgives everyone who had been causing him trouble. But his conversion, which changes him to a pacifist, does not believe he should be fighting in the Army and becomes a Consciousness Objector. Raised in the backwoods and being a sharp shooter with a rifle winning all kinds of shooting awards in his State of Tennessee, he becomes at odds with the thinking of the Army. But when he demonstrates his skills as a sharp shooter at the firng range, the Army allows him to think about whether he wants to leave  the Army or become a soldier. Cooper, after given time to think it over, comes to a conclusion to be a soldier, and when shipped to the battlefield in France, Cooper becomes a one man hero, as he captures 132 German soldiers by himself.

Cooper returns a decorated hero and is given a ticker tape parade in New York, but after a while, he returns to his native town in Tennseee to be further honored and returns to his girl friend and his mother who had been waiting for him to return.

A very inspiring movie and just a great performance by Cooper and al. The movie has strong Christian overtones. I saw this movie first when I was in Elementary School where it was shown in the auditorium. But, with the way things are today with religion and the schools, it would never be shown in the schools. today. But, with the DVD, one can enjoy this great, inspiring, pro American, movie.

2. The Fountainhead- Gary Cooper with Raymond Massey and Patricia Neal. Cooper plays a modern Architect who builds stuctures in a manner not with the normal views and conventions that prevail at the time. For this, he is challenged by others and condemned for it publically, and in the Courts. A moving drama with a heavy romance between Cooper and Patricia Neal. The underlying subplot is indiviuality vs. collectiveness. Does one give in the collective thought and wisdom of the day by compromising to others in building structures, or does one stand up and produce what he believes expresses indivudality and freedom?

3. Dallas- An average Western cowboy yarn made better than average by the acting of great acting stars like Gary Cooper, Raymond Massey, Ruth Roman, and Steve Cochran. Massey, along with Cochran, are the villians. Massey is a real estate swindler giving mortgages to settlers and then foreclosing early and taking the people's land and money. Cooper is the lawman out to stop him and this crooked business and goes after Cochran who is working with Massey and out to shoot Cooper. Plenty of action and old fashioned western shooting in this movie that presents the entertainment that western movie buffs enjoy.

4. Springfield Rifle- This movie, starring Gary Cooper is an excellent western feature in this movie pack that surprised me in how good it is, considering that Sgt. York was part of the pack. Cooper is a Major in the U.S. Army during the Civil War who is charged with cowardice, stripped from his command at a Court Marshal, branded with a yellow stripe down the back of his shirt, and forced to leave the fort in disgrace. It appears that he and the Lt. under his command, who brought the charges against him, are at odds with each other. But, in reality, both are part of a newly counter intelligence unit who is trying to find out, who in the Army, is giving vital information to the Confederates about the movement of much needed horses to the field units.

Cooper plays like he has joind up with a band of raiders who steals the horses and sells them to the South for money. Cooper's effort to play like he is a traitor, along with his dishonorable discharge, confuses his wife and hurts his image with his son.

Cooper finds out who the traitor is within the Army which is a surprise that I will not reveal. There is plenty of action in this movie as Cooper's efforts are rewarded with the capture of the traitor and his rise back to being resinstated and honored by the Army for his great work in helping save the Union. Plus, his efforts allow him to get back in good graces with his wife and son as they find out that he is not a coward or a traitor, but a hero for great undercover work for his country.

5. The Wreck of the Mary Deere- A very unusal story of a salvage unit, led by Charlton Heston, comes upon a ship, burning at sea, with only Gary Cooper aboard. When Heston boards the ship, the two men are at odds with each other as Cooper's explanation of what happened to the crew and why the ship is burning does not sit well with Heston. It appears that Cooper is the fault of eveything and that he may have even murdered the Captain. But Cooper will not reveal what happened and asks Heston to keep quiet about the ship and trust him. He gets Heston to agree that the ship sank at sea when they return to shore when in fact, they grounded the ship on rocks on a reef.

It is later revealed in the movie that the owners of the ship were in a deal with members of the crew who later abandoned the ship to sell the cargo of modern airplane parts to China for money and collect the insurance money for the ship that supposedly sunk. The owners were in business with selling materials to the enemy. Cooper is being set up and charged as the one who set fire to the boat with an explosion and who killed the Captain, and who told the crew to abandon ship for no good reason.

Even Heston believes that Cooper might be the culprit until Cooper convinces Heston to go to the ship which is on the reef at sea, and get Scuba gear to check the cargo bin to see what is in the cargo crates. The crates should still contain the airplane engines, provided that they were not actually sold to the enemy. But, this gets back to the owners of the ship, and members of the crew who were in on the selling of the engines, and they go after Cooper and Heston to stop them from discovering and reporting the facts about the crates on the ship.

An excellent and unusal drama script with great acting by great actors.",1295740800,,6832,4.668329177057356

2645017,5,B000HWZ4EI,"Here you have them--Five Gary Cooper Classics in one package.  Of this group, I like Sergeant York and the Wreck of the Mary Deare the best.  They are all great movies, that you may think you have not seen, but when you get into them, you may realize you have.  They are part of being an American.  Sergeant York--the biography of a WWI soldier and his heroism.  Dallas--not so much about the city, at this point in time a hitching post and a watering hole, but about by products of the Civil War, The Fountainhead--a story about a great American architect, artistically incorruptable, based loosely on Frank Lloyd Wright, The Wreck of the Mary Deare--Gary finds himeself in the abandoned hulk of a ship, and is drawn into mystery and intrigue, and The Springfield Rifle--Gary goes through the humiliation of having a yellow streak painted down his back for cowardice by the Cavalry. What great acting he does in this one as we feel his humiliation but we also feel the foreshadowing of a little more to the story than meets the eye.  You can see it on his face. He projects it. What great films.  These are part of most Americans of a certain age's viewing history.  And you can enjoy them again and again, as you ponder what makes up a real American.  No one can show us on film like Gary Cooper.",1222041600,,1298,4.48936170212766

2645020,5,B000HWZ4EI,"This signature collection of films starring Gary Cooper that are now under the control of Warner Home Video is a great tribute to an actor whose film career spanned 35 years. Two of the films are 5 star films - ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Sergeant York"", two more are 4 star films - ""The Wreck of the Mary Deare"" and ""Springfield Rifle"", and one film is a 3 star work - ""Dallas"". The idea of the signature collections is to present the best performances of an actor or actress in as good a group of films as possible, not vice versa. Thus, you don't necessarily have the best movies a particular performer did, but you do have their finest performances.

""Sergeant York"" gets the best treatment of the collection, with a special two disk edition that includes a commentary track by film historian Jeannine Basinger, the classic Warner Brothers cartoon ""Porky's Preview"", the vintage short film ""Lions for Sale"", several Gary Cooper film trailers, a very good documentary on the making of Sergeant York, and a documentary on the life Gary Cooper. Cooper does a very good job in holding your attention in a rather long film tribute to the story of Alvin York, who pretty much single-handedly killed 32 German soldiers and captured 132 others during World War I. This performance won him his first Best Actor Oscar.

The role of Howard Roark in ""The Fountainhead"" must have been a difficult one to pull off, but Cooper does it with style and with believability in a real departure from his other screen roles. Here he is still the rugged individualist, but a different kind than what you're probably accustomed to seeing. I've never bought into Ayn Rand's philosophy, but this movie is very well done with some great performances, even if you do have a hard time buying the motivations of the supporting players. The film comes with a featurette on the making of the film, and is quite enlightening.

The other three films do not have extra features. My favorite of the three is ""The Wreck of the Mary Deare"". Here Cooper costars with Charleton Heston as a mysterious ship captain found alone on a ghost ship when Heston's salvage company runs across the abondoned vessel. Through a large part of the film you can't tell if Cooper is playing a crazy man, a criminal, or one of the good guys. It's a good combination maritime adventure and courtroom drama and also features a good performance from a very young Richard Harris in a supporting role.

No Gary Cooper collection would be complete without some westerns, and so we have ""Springfield Rifle"", which is a rather obscure but excellent western with plenty of twists and turns in the plot. ""High Noon"" it is not, but it will still hold your interest with Cooper playing a dishonorably discharged Army officer during the late stages of the Civil War. Finally, there is ""Dallas"", another western and the least entertaining of the five films. It is above average, but that is about all. The best part of the film is seeing Raymond Massey, who often plays self-righteous parts, play a murderous villain. Don't get me wrong, Cooper plays the fugitive ex-Confederate soldier to perfection, it's just the material itself that could have been better.

Warner's still has several other good Gary Cooper films it has not released to DVD yet, so perhaps there  will be a volume two. If so, one wish I have that I hope is granted is that Warner Bros. rescues ""Meet John Doe"" from the public domain and includes it.",1182988800,4,3449,4.72093023255814
2645021,3,B000HWZ4EI,"On this collection there are two of the best films ever made by Coop : Sergeant York (1941) and The Fountainhead (1949)which contain extras and interesting featurettes but why were chosen as part of this collection such B Westerns as Dallas (1950) and Springfield Rifle (1952)and a lower than average film like ""The Wreck of the Mary Deare"" (1959)? It would be a far better product if titles such as Saratoga Trunk (1943), Task Force (1949) and The Hanging Tree (1959)for example (Warner has the property rights in each case) would have been considered. It is my hope that a 2nd Volume (like in the case of Errol Flynn & Humphrey Bogart Collections)would be prepared soon.",1179619200,12,672,4.801724137931035
2645022,5,B000HWZ4EI,"I purchased this set because The Fountainhead is one of my favorite meaningful movies from my childhood about standing up for what you believe in. Gary Cooper did a fantastic job in the lead as Roark. The bonus of other great Cooper films such as Sgt. York made this set a great buy. The set also contains some very informative special features which talk about the making of and the hows and whys of each of the films. If anyone wants to see a film that is inspirational in the strongest sense of standing up for what you believe in then The Fountainhead is a must see. Even though it is set in the 1950's, the principles of Roark are still appropriate today.",1174348800,,660,4.373983739837398
2645023,5,B000HWZ4EI,"One of the best films in this collection, Gary Cooper plays Alvin York, a pacifist unable to kill during Warld War I. A heroic performance that makes us ponder on the perenial subject of the value of life during conflict between men. An excellent experience. Would highly recommend this collection. As usual, Gary Cooper is a best-in-class actor!",1172620800,5,346,4.982758620689655

2645025,5,B000HWZ4EI,"The Fountain Head
When Ayn Rand wrote this book; the Fountain Head, she envisioned a hero, Howard Roark, that represents the ideal man, one we should get to know, understand and emulate. Individualism is the impacting message Ayn Rand leaves with us. Played by Gary Cooper; who takes on the role of the hero, the aspiring architect with an uncompromising creative vision, that will not bend when it comes to his beliefs and convictions... whether for a job, rewards, fame, or for acceptance. This movie represents a brilliant execution of one of the best books ever written! As a young child, Ayn Rand, witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, which she denounced from its outset. Living through the struggle made a mark on her personality, for through her writings we clearly understand the theory of individualism. Would highly recommend owning this movie if you want to learn about a hero who will relentlessly pursue his dreams without compromising his soul! Awesome!

Dallas
In Dallas, Cooper is fun and as usual... debonaire. His role as Confederate raider Blayde ""Reb"" Hollister, is interesting to watch. The script is lively; with lots of action, and at times, rather funny, so we enjoyed it! We have watched most of the DVDs in this series thanks to the visit from one of our relatives; Arnold Kline, who simply... loves Cooper! Without a doubt, this DVD collection is something we should own, if we want to enjoy best in class performances!

The Wreck of the Mary Deare
Aboard the freighter Mary Deare we find Gary Cooper, alone, involved in what seems to be a rather mysterious ship abandonment. Charlton Heston, in the ship salvaging business, is rather interested in the freighter because he considers it a business opportunity. But, the plot thickens. And soon, Heston is involved in the traumatic events that lead to the crew's departure. During a London Court of Inquiry, Cooper faces many who are out to prove his ill intent. Cooper's performance is best in class and for the first time, we witness someone who outshines Heston. Cooper demonstrates character and the strength necessary to redeem his name. Would highly suggest owning this DVD if you want to witness determination that demands justice, and character that prevails through trials and tribulations.

Sergeant York
With this performance, Gary Cooper leaves no doubt as to his amazing ability to portray a decent, honest, and all-around principled man. He plays Alvin York, a man from the country, who was prone to drinking and having fun, until his mother, a new found love and an encounter with danger makes him find religion and meaning in his life. He is a sharpshooter who is drafted to fight during World War I, but who conscientiously objects because the Bible teaches us that we shall not kill. His performance is heroic, fun, adventuresome and gentle. One can not see these films without pondering whether Gary Cooper was acting, or is Gary Cooper simply a fine human being whose soul shines through to provide an example of the finest principles. Would highly recommend obtaining this DVD... In these troubled times we have much to learn from the human spirit shared through these magnificent movies.",1169164800,28,3194,4.977528089887641

You can imagine the joy of a Gary Cooper's Fan watching these films for the first time.

Thank you very much to the Amazon organisation making that opportunity possible. I'm 100% satisfied. Best wishes.
