I enjoyed this show quite a bit and found it very interesting; I just wish Discovery kept filming this show and avoided other shows that consume the listings.

3994170,5,B002V8RCLE,"A very good show, that I wished that had more seasons to see what all the men  had to go through just to log during the very cold winter.  Discovery Channel messed up, not by not having more seasons of this show.",1387065600,2,212,4.023809523809524

The Pelletier garage is open during the week and you can visit the boys if thieir around at the garage...or visit Reggie...it is only about a mile on the Golden road outside of Millinoclet, friday is a good day in the late afternoon to visit the garage.

3994174,5,B002V8RCLE,"Check out what kind of logging is going on - on the east coast.
Find out why our loggers haul loads to Canada to get paid.
Learn why hard times are just as hard here.
As for Ice Roads - we have those too.

Actually I'm in New Hampshire, but Maine is just a few miles away.
And it still has lots of frontier land.
