8123816,1,B000FJX706,"I'm of Slovenian descent, and have been to the country a few times so that is why I watched this movie.  The movie went no where fast, was very repetitive, and in my opinion didn't really give insight into the culture.  Also there were no interesting locals or cinematography, just a lot of random shots inside of decripid buildings and the motorcycle track.",1388880000,2,358,4.666666666666667
8123817,4,B000FJX706,"good film, shows a rare perspective on traffickers as humans, however imperfect they are, without trivializing the enormous risks and lawlessness that illegal immigrants must endure on their passage. the film is probably not delivering on Hollywood expectations, but I think it is a moving and illuminating piece of art.",1362528000,,320,5.42
8123818,5,B000FJX706,"A personal depiction of the human dramas that evolve in the process of illegal immigration - from Eastern to Western Europe. In the light of the recent concerns of the many European countries on the subject of their new citizens and neighbors, this is a good reminder of what price the illegal immigrants have to pay in their Pursuit of Happiness.",1292544000,,347,4.704918032786885
8123819,5,B000FJX706,"I thought they did a great job of developing characters but I do admit there were places the acting could use some help. I thought most of the actors did a great job. Im agreeing with all the reviews to a small point but they succeed in bringing you into their world.

I especially loved the history, politics and economy issues rolled into the movie. Maybe a five is high but the characters make it worth watching. Definately the buy. It captures a period of slovene history so brief I fear it will be forgotten.

One of the characters even discusses it and the EU. lol",1246147200,,570,4.367924528301887
8123820,3,B000FJX706,"Weak cast and direction don't quite pull it off. Strong theme, though. No doubt about it.
I wanted it to have a greater impact on me emotionally than it ultimately did.

What can you do? Not every director is  a Claude Chabrol or Akira Kurosawa, and not every actor is a Chris Cooper or Seymour Hoffman or Marlon Brando. Neither is every actress a Carol Baker. Carol Baker was one amazing thespian in her time.

Could be am being too harsh here. Not sure. That's the way I see it so far.",1214956800,,487,4.271739130434782
8123821,5,B000FJX706,"First off, this is a ""film movement"" movie.  I wouldn't have known about it except that when I was unemployed I went to the library to get dvd's.  After awhile I started to look for any dvd that was released from this dvd release club.  The movies are from all around the world and they are mostly much better than average.

""Spare parts"" stands out in my mind because it blends the geography, economics, and history of Slovenia to give this story momentum forward in a naturalistic manner.  The characters have a life of their own much like what the Dardenne brothers are doing with their own movies.  Had a large distributer picked this movie up it would have become an arthouse favorite.

If you liked ""Rosetta,"" ""The Promise,"" ""The Child,"" and /or ""The Son""  then you will certainly enjoy this film.",1203292800,6,803,4.605633802816901
8123822,4,B000FJX706,"This downbeat film from Slovenia follows the lives of two men who illegally transport third-world refugees across the border into Italy. Set against the noisy excitement of motorcycle racing and the ominous presence of a huge nuclear power complex, the danger of their own illicit work takes on a kind of dreary routine, in which death and misfortune become simply part of the cost of doing business. Lost and without a future, Ludvik has only his past glory as a racing champion to give his life some meaning. Meanwhile, mourning the loss of a young wife who has died of cancer, he chain smokes and drinks himself regularly into oblivion.

His young assistant, Rudi, is a novice at this kind of self-obliteration, objecting at first to the callousness of the men who transport the refugees and appalled when he learns of the fate that awaits many of them. But as the film progresses, he too surrenders to the mind-numbing conditions of his line of work - an occupation that has ironically sprung into being with the birth of the European Union. At the end of the film, Ludvik ruefully observes that Hitler also attempted to create a unified Europe, though he went to ""extremes,"" but this trafficking in humans is no different in its effect - the death of the soul.",1191801600,6,1265,4.723981900452489
