2477166,5,B000E0LLQ8,"Not your typical cop, not your typical superhero. That's James Ellison, detective with heightened senses. I watched the show initially and was thrilled to find out it was out in DVD. It's held up well over the years with only items like an overly large cell phone to clue the audience that they're watching something that's ten years old.

This series has more than its fair share of chases and explosions, all done well, but it's about so much more than that. The characters are key, with Jim Ellison taking front and center as a man trying to deal with a unique ability while remaining grounded. He's not perfect, not by any means, and that's what makes this series so special. The hero is flawed but in ways you want to find out more about.

This particular hero has a sidekick, but one that is unlike any other we've seen in this or any other genre. Blair Sandburg is smart, intuitive and clearly thrilled to have found a real live sentinel, which just happens to be the subject of his thesis. To him, this is the trade of a lifetime: He'll help Ellison learn to use and live with his senses, and in return, he gets to study Ellison and earn his doctorate.  But the relationship becomes so much more as these two very different men work side-by-side (to the utter confusion and befuddlement of Ellison's boss, superbly played by Bruce A Yound) and become true friends.

Which really defines this show. It's about a friendship formed under the most extrordinary circumstances.

The DVD's are excellent, the picture clear and the sound true, but Paramount really missed the boat by not including extras. Interviews with the stars, outtakes, the creators sharing their thoughts -- this would vaulted the DVD into the outer stratosphere. A home run. I only hope they'll wise up for Season two through four.

In any case, this is a great addition to any collection and if you're seeing this series for the first time -- prepare to get hooked. Line and sinker.",1145404800,,1958,4.644508670520231

2477168,5,B000E0LLQ8,"Happily, all Sentinel fans are celebrating the ten year anniversary of the first episode airing with the release of the first season DVDs. I am pleased with the art work on the main box and the interior holders. Great colors, nice images and very good  pictures of Richard Burgi. Unfortunately, Garett Maggart and Bruce A. Young rated only one tiny picture on the back cover of the main box.

I found the picture quality of the episodes excellent. I've seen it on SciFi and this is much better. Really sharp and crisp. Well worth the price.

This series is a fun trip. There are places that could have been better written or filmed. There is bad blue screen, but all in all, it's a great journey getting to know Jim, Blair and Simon.",1145404800,5,733,4.496240601503759

We taped as many episodes as we could before we left to share them with our coworkers and their families.  It became everyone's favorite, and the show most requested for those taping shows for us back home.  We were loaning tapes out to people we didn't even know!  It's not just a guy's show--it's for those of us women who like blowing things up, and the interaction between the two main characters is great.  It's a good, clean, family show, which is probably why it was canceled.  I really miss it, but I'm glad I can finally watch it again on DVD!",1138060800,7,667,4.373983739837398
2477174,5,B000E0LLQ8,"The Sentinel has had an incredibly strong fandom lasting many, many years after its demise.  Much of this was due to overseas syndication, reruns, and word of mouth.  The show was originally made by guys and for guys, with lots of blow-stuff-up action.  But it's the sexy appeal of the lead characters that has kept female fans interested - VERY interested.  So if you're reading this review and you haven't seen the show before, there's my plug.  Something for everyone.  If you're already a fan, you need no encouragement to buy and support this fantastic show.  :-)",1136160000,20,568,4.793814432989691
2477175,5,B000E0LLQ8,"I was one of the people who wrote to Paramount when the series was cancelled, and later, was one of those who wrote requesting that the series be released on DVD. I began to gain hope when Paramount released the War of the World TV series. Yes, I know they were cashing in release of the movie DVD with Tom Cruise, but it was a glimmer. With Richard Burgi being in Desperate Housewives, that would be a very good reason to release The Sentinel now and cash in. The series was well written and well acted. One of the few series I made sure I taped. You truly believed that lead characters were the best of friends. And from the bloopers I've seen both lead actors seem to like each other.

2477182,5,B000E0LLQ8,"Great show. I just discovered this recently, and I've fallen love with the characters. It is definitely a show of the '90's, which I love. It has a certain corniness that was endemic to shows made then. It brings back good memories of my childhood. Anyway, the premise is very interesting. The main character, Jim Ellison, has superhuman senses. All five senses are far beyond normal which allows him to do things ordinary people can't. He needs help learning to control them. The other lead, Blair Sandburg, is there to help him. The relationship between them is an important part of the show. It is basically a buddy cop show with an occasional dose of mysticism.

Although I was disappointed to learn the rest of the series has never been released.  I do not understand why considering how many old shows are being released nowadays.  Hopefully the owners will see there is a market that really wants the rest and will eventually release them.  It is a buddy cop show only with a twist as only one of them is a cop and the other one is anthropologist, working on his thesis.  Blair's thesis happens to be on Sentinels that is how he runs across Jim who is having trouble with his senses.  Each episode has Blair and Jim working together to solve cases and learn more about being a Sentinel and how to control Jim's gift.

2477194,5,B000E0LLQ8,"Bought Season 1 when it first came out on DVD, THRILLED that it had been released. Have been heartbroken ever since that no further seasons have followed. Thanks to reruns, I now have all the rest of them on VHS, at least, but I'm a bit surprised the rest of the series hasn't been released on disc yet. The fans are out there. There were enough of them to pull Blair out of that fountain and resuscitate him for a final season, so surely there are enough to warrant releasing the rest of the series! The first season discs don't have any 'bells and whistles' -- like commentaries, deleted scenes, shooting scripts, etc. -- but even if the remaining seasons are released the same no-frills way, I'd definitely buy them.

My rating:
5 stars for this DVD set's existence and for the quality of the episodes.
2 1/2 stars for the fact that they contain ONLY the episodes and NOTHING else, not even closed captions.
1 star... negative stars if it was possible... for ONLY season 1 having been released.",1348012800,2,997,4.538888888888889

Hope the rest to come out since when I left Romania, Blair was dead and I was completely heartbroken.  I'd love to see the last bit so perhaps a happy ending!",1346889600,,458,4.264367816091954

2477197,5,B000E0LLQ8,"""The Sentinel"" was such an awesome television show!  Exciting plots, great explosions and car chases, and a wonderful cast, especially the stars, the so-handsome and ripped Richard Burgi and the amazingly cute Garett Maggert.  I am so happy to be able to own the first season to re-watch whenever I want.  The quality of this dvd set is excellent, the sound and picture quality are lovely, but there are no extras, which I have come to expect in sets such as this.  I wish there was close-captioning, at the very least.

Syfy channel is being stingy in their re-airing of this series, some episodes are skipped, and the ones they do show have scenes cut, so I am very eager for the release of the subsequent seasons on dvd.  Please, please release season two soon!",1323475200,,764,4.622222222222222

If you agree then please write as well. Fans managed to get the fourth season made when the studio had no intention of making it. Now fans can get it totally released onto dvd if we work together.

please write to paramount and tell them how you feel and that you want the sentinel on dvd.

2477201,4,B000E0LLQ8,Sci-Fi version of a 'buddy' cop show. It is funny and entertaining. The mystery plots aren't great - but they are bad either. I enjoyed nearly every episode of the first season - and will purchase the second season when it becomes available.,1303171200,,241,4.627906976744186
2477202,4,B000E0LLQ8,"I probably saw almost every episode of this series when it was on TV years ago. When I put in the DVD and watched the pilot episode I was blown away all over again. This series has interesting characters, great stunts, and incredible (especially for a TV series budget) effects. Everything is tied in to the story, so we care about the characters (all the regulars, not just the stars). The stunts and explosions are integral, not just thrown in for their own sake.

As I watched a few more episodes, I remembered that this kind of treatment wasn't just reserved for the pilot episode.

The only problems with this set are the short (10 episodes) length of the season and the fact that the last few episodes of this first season weren't as strong as the first six or seven. (Maybe the weaker end to the season is part of the reason the rest of the series hasn't been released yet?)

Highly recommended to those who like action with some mysticism thrown in. If you liked Doc Savage and The Destroyer, pick this up while you still can!",1299542400,3,1034,4.4603174603174605

The product itself is quite compact - less than an inch wide - and much smaller than the Highlander S4 set I ordered a few years back.

My only question is, what happened to the DVD for seasons 2 & 3? I couldn't find it on amazon and it doesn't make sense that only one season of the show would've been made into DVD considering how long it's been off the air...",1284249600,,539,4.223300970873787
2477206,5,B000E0LLQ8,"I started watching this series by accident here in England on CBS Action.  I was soon captivated by the relationship between the two male stars - characters Jim Ellison and Blair Sandburg - that along with the Police Captain Simon Banks makes this a really watchable show. Jim is The Sentinel whose heightened senses give him an edge in fighting crime in Cascade city.  Blair is his Guide who helps Jim to train and focus his senses so he can utilise them to their fullest potential.  Until Blair came along Jim was having a hard time with his Sentinel powers and it was slowly sending him insane as he was unable to control them.

It has a bit of everything action, humour, excitement, drama, and it's basically great fun to watch.  It's amusing when Blair hardly gets called by his first name but everyone either just calls him Sandburg or he gets called all sorts of nicknames like ""Chief"" and ""Hairboy"".  It's these sorts of little details that make series so watchable for the fans.

I ordered the DVDs as soon as I finished watching season 1.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of seasons 2 - 4 when those at be decide to do so, it's been 4 years since season 1 was released, so they're not exactly rushing to release them!!

2477211,4,B000E0LLQ8,"Seeing Season One brought back memories.  It reminded me of how much I like the concept of enhanced senses, totem animal guides, and the mix of them with modern-day law enforcement.
This first season introduced Jim Ellison, Blair Sandburg, and the partnership and eventual friendship they are just beginning to form. The season shows the beginning steps of a police detective (Jim Ellison played by Richard Burgi) reluctant to use his newly rediscovered powers of sense-enhancement because of the fact that he does not realize what is happening to him, and is suspicious of what he does not understand or see as normal.  The show also introduces different situations and substances that someone with enhanced perceptions might come into contact with and be affected by.
With the introduction of an enthusiastic Anthropologist (Blair Sandburg played by Garrett Maggart), a gruff yet supportive police Captain (played by Bruce A. Young), a supporting cast of other characters and a mystical history of the Sentinel calling itself there is potential for the most interesting police-based sci-fi show to come out of the late-90s (if not the only one).
In sum, it was a good introduction to the series, albeit only a foot in the door. The succeeding seasons increase in both quality of writing and the depth of the characters, but that they could not have done so without building on the foundation set by these first episodes.",1234742400,2,1422,5.046808510638298

2477219,4,B000E0LLQ8,"""The Sentinel: The Complete First Season"" contains the initial 10 episodes for a unique police procedural, first aired in 1996. Jim Ellison (a stalwart Richard Burgi) is the sole survivor of a Special Forces mission in the jungles of Peru. Now a police detective in Cascade, Washington, Ellison discovers that he has acquired heightened senses highly useful in crime-fighting, if he can learn to control them. His consultation with anthropology graduate student Blair Sandberg (Garrett Maggart) reveals that he has a rare genetic predisposition for heightened sensory powers. Blair teams up with Jim to help him learn to control his unusual condition, while gathering material for what promises to be a fantastic graduate thesis. Bruce Young is outstanding as the Police Chief.

The ten episodes cover an variety of crimes and opponents, from simple killers to serial murders to gunrunners and drug traffickers. Jim and Blair make an appealing team, if often hamstrung by clunky dialogue and very limited special effects. Most episodes provide Ellison one or more opportunities to solve a crime or save a life using his remarkable ability to see, hear, smell, touch, or taste better than the average human. One memorable episode has Blair trapped inside police headquarters, which has been taken over by a criminal gang, while Jim tries to break in. Another, exceptionally innovative episode has Jim and Blair escorting a criminal on a train, only to have Jim's senses go haywire from a dose of cold medicine.

The series was interesting in its time, and worth a look-back now.",1204761600,,1577,5.15625
2477220,5,B000E0LLQ8,"This show is about so much more than just your average ""get the bad guys"" cop show... It has so much more to offer, but I guess that it is hard for some to grasp the deep friendship build from nothing and all the different characters preformanses...

Richard Burgi is just great as Detective Ellison - and yes, he is a bit stiff (or whatever) sometimes... but that is just so Ellison like..

And Garett Maggart is super as Blair Sandburg - his enthusiasm, energy and way of seeing things is refreshing and you just have to love him...

The extra twist of the show are the senses and if you took 'em away, I agree it might have been a dull show, but with them.. - oh, man (blair style)..

If you, like me, like buddy shows with a good plot and a lot of action.

I was glad to see that the first season was released on dvd and was very pleased with the offering.  What I don't like is that this is it!  What's happened to the remaining seasons?  Anyway, if you're considering purchasing this set but don't want to start without the entire series being available, I urge you to go ahead and buy it.  **Spoiler**  The final episode of this set does not end w/a cliff-hangar so you won't feel as if you're missing out on the opening episode of the 2nd season.  **End Spoiler**",1191542400,2,610,4.298245614035087

I ordered from Germany - I love to see it undubbed... the German dubbing sucks ;)

Too bad that it took so long to give the fans at least the first season on DVD - and I'm honest, I doubt that we will get to see the rest on DVD... and that's a shame. The fandom is still there and strong - I don't get it why Paramount (or whoever is responsible) seem to think it isn't worth it to put all the episodes on DVD's

It was fun to be able to enjoy the show again and see how the Sentinel and his Guide first got together. I hope that there will be a release of all of the other episodes one day soon.

2477228,5,B000E0LLQ8,"The ""buddy show' genre in television programming has unfortunately met its demise these days so it's refreshing to see that some of the best can live on through DVD release.  ""The Sentinel"" is among the best shows this genre had to offer.  It featured an outstanding cast which included Richard Burgi,

Garrett Maggart, and Bruce A. Young.  In addition to a talented cast, ""The Sentinel"" featured intelligent police drama, high suspense, and the unique mysteries surrounding Jim's abilities as a Sentinel.  In subsequent seasons - which I hope are released on DVD soon! - Jim's role as Sentinel and Blair's role as Guide are expanded and Sentinel Mysticism factors into the plot of almost every episode.  Personally, I loved the mystical element of this series.  It made the show unique and creative, two concepts sorely lacking in the programs airing today.

This DVD set is excellent, though I would like to see a full cast photo on the cover of future releases.  These ten first season episodes are outstanding for their visual quality and content. As I finished watching the set I found it difficult to not watch the rest of the series on my old worn out VHS tapes!  It was interesting to watch and I wanted to see more.  It's unfortunate that season one and two were not combined into one set.  Season Two must be released as the true essence of this program is only explored after the first ten episodes.

""The Sentinel"" aired in the late 1990's on the UPN Network and quickly picked up a huge and enthusiastic fan base.  This fan base is still very much alive today and I encourage anyone who may have missed this series when it aired to pick up the Season One DVD set.  I guarantee you will have a new favorite ""buddy show"" to enjoy whenever you wish!

Looking forward to Season Two and beyond...",1161907200,7,1804,4.643533123028392

2477230,5,B000E0LLQ8,"Jim Ellison is a special forces soldier who's abandoned by the army believed dead. When the army discover Ellison is very much alive he returns to civilzation as a detective with the Cascade PD. Here, Ellison begins to see things other people don't and hear things other people don't naturally, he thinks he's crazy. He goes to hospital to find out what's going on and meets up with Sanburg, a university student studying people with hyperactive senses. Sandburg offers to help Jim as long as he can become he's thesis and this is the beginning of the series.

What I liked about this series was it's new its not like any other police detective movie I've ever seen. I think Sandburg hits the nail on the head when he says ""you're a monster man, you're a walking crime lab, with organic sensory equipment what more could you want?"". It's a good storyline, its exciting, and its very different. The first two series were very good but the series was cancelled after the third. I wasn't a fan of the third series I believe it lost the plot somewhat. While Jim had hyperactive senses these senses would still have their limits and by the third series they were stretching the capacities of his senses.",1152144000,5,1198,4.624413145539906

I had two problems with the DVD that I hope will be changed for upcoming versions.  There is no way to select a specific chapter and there are no subtitles.  I love and always use the subtitle feature on all of my DVDs!  I live with my grandmother and if I turn up the volume to hear all of the dialogue, the action scenes are too loud.

2477233,4,B000E0LLQ8,"Happy yet again my UK DVD plays American DVDs! Starring Richard Burgi as the eponymous Sentinel this show was science ""faction"", based on reallife individuals with heightened senses such as LRRPs/the VC in Vietnam. Newcomer Garrett Maggart was excellent as Jim's ""Guide""/sidekick and Bruce A Young was spot on as their boss Simon Banks. Season 1 had strong plots and it really hit its stride in Seasons 2 & 3 (I shall definitely be purchasing these). WHy not 5 stars, then? Not entirely the show's fault; it's biggest problem was its sister show Viper, basically an endless advert for the Dodge car firm and subsidised by them. Much the weaker show, Viper got the lion's share of the budget and time and occasionally thats obvious (though Maggart and Burgi deserved medals for pulling off continously good TV on a clearly shoestring budget and often tenuous plot). Sentinel had enormous potential to be a long-running, richly plotted series but despite consistently high-ratings was messed about with cruelly by the network to the point where, after the Season 4 opener (closing the Season 3 cliffhanger/cost cutting attempt by the network rewritten after fan protests)the remaining episodes were slot-in-anywhere standalones as the writers did not wish to start a storyarc that the fans would never see resolved (as in The Egg Man Cometh for Now & Again). Despite being assured of a full season, their fears came true.",1147219200,7,1419,5.042553191489362
2477234,4,B000E0LLQ8,"The Sentinel was one of those fun shows from the late 1990's; fun cop drama with lots of humor.  There was some cheesy-ness, but over all it was a good series.

As for the DVD's pictures and sound is superb.  Honestly, the picture quality is better than when the series ran on UPN, and the sound, while only being 2 channel is still wide open and fills the room nicely.

However, there are no special features here and no close captioning.  Fans know there are blooper reels in existance and I hope for future seasons we see some extras.  Commentaries with Richard Burgi, Garett Maggert, and Bruce A Young would be nice as well",1146009600,26,627,4.456140350877193
2477235,4,B000E0LLQ8,"After what seems like too many years, fans of The Sentinel have finally been rewarded for their perserverance with Season One on DVD.

My rating is actually split between my rating for the show and for the DVD set itself. The show earns 5 stars for it's interesting premise, exciting action sequences and talented actors who gave these characters so much charisma. Especially of note is Richard Burgi as Jim Ellison - a police detective with enhanced senses, and Garett Maggart as Blair Sandburg - the university graduate student who is the only one who really understands what Jim is and is able to help him.

The DVD set contains 10 episodes and while that's plenty of entertainment, the set has absolutely none of the extras that seem to have become standard. That was a little dissapointing and lowered my final rating slightly, but I'm still delighted to finally have this show on DVD.",1145577600,16,890,4.7727272727272725
8103515,4,B000E0LLQ8,"I have a hard time rating any kind of entertainment product, as everyone's tastes are unique.  That said, this show should appeal to many.

At this point, this show is going to feel dated.  The first season of this show came out when cell phones (not smartphones, just old cell phones) were still barely a thing.  Think about how much has changed since then.  So everything from the technology to the sets to the dynamics of race, gender, and sexuality are going to feel a bit outdated.  That said, a cop show is a cop show, and their appeal is often timeless.  What really sets The Sentinel apart, however, is the core premise--the main character has superhuman (though pseudo-scientifically possible) senses.  This gives added depth to the show as the writers correctly choose to make this as much curse as blessing for the character.  Add in an entertaining (but not over-the-top) sidekick, a well-acted police captain (actor Bruce A. Young), and decent dialogue and you've got a recipe for success.

On another note, much as I love cities like New York, LA, and DC, it is refreshing to have a show that isn't set in one of those locales, but rather in Cascade, Washington (essentially a stand-in for Seattle, though I'm not sure if it's a real place or not).

Overall this is a fun series and worth watching.  It also seems like they have finally released the other seasons, so go ahead and buy this for some fun TV viewing.",1511049600,,1428,4.645418326693227

I noticed from the first disc that it played ... loudly in the dv player? as in the machine made more ambient noise than I'd ever heard in a dvd player before, and every once in a while there would be lags as if there were skips but when I rewound to the same place it would play back just fine. On disc 2, however, at the end of episode 6, it just stopped and refused to continue and episode 7 was a a no-go as well. Episode 8 played. When I looked at the back of the disc, I noticed a prominent flaw. As the set had been factory-sealed when I received it, and other buyers of the complete series have mentioned similar problems with playback, I'm guessing this is a problem with the manufacture lot or the company which produced the series.

This is beside the point, but do be aware that this is a bare bones production-no extras we've become used to, no bloopers, no closed captioning.",1469404800,2,983,4.313513513513514
