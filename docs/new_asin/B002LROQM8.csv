Plot: The axis of the film narrative is the conflict between two attitudes. A group of students are spending the summer vacation at a university camp studying the science of linguistics. One of the camp directors, Jaroslaw, is a young professor who prefers the straightforward, intimate approach to students. He is opposed in his liberal views by Jakub, who likes to manipulate people. There is a confrontation from the beginning when Jaroslaw allows to attend the seminar a student who presents the views not according to the official line. In the end, a jury prize is given to mediocre paper, while the suspected school of thought still draws a recommendation. Finally the deputy rector arrives for the closing ceremonies, and since he disfavors the line of thought awarded by the recommendation the tensions rise. They climax when student in question bites the rector in the ear while receiving recommendation. The confrontation results in a scandal and the police is called in.

Plot:  From the first shot, the film is bleak: in its use of black and white; its setting of a snowy, frozen wasteland; the austerity of the lives of Jan and Anna; a stark soundtrack; and what appears to be a deliberate underexposure of the film--an effect highlighted by a clip from a film the characters see as part of the action which is clearer and brighter than the rest of the film. The aesthetic bleakness of the film mirrors the bleakness of life under Communism...",1250467200,6,5446,5.687192118226601
