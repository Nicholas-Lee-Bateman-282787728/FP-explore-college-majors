It also has lovely personality and creates a one-on-one atmosphere, so you really feel like you are in a class - it's not like watching a YouTube video. You learn names of the type of movement you are making in order to create other movement, so you have a foundation to build on as well as specific ""tricks"" to begin or add to your movement vocabulary.

It is, however, lacking transitional moves. This could have been made up with the performances shown at the end, but they were not filmed well. It's like whoever was filming was more interested in the PEOPLE than the PROPS, and got distracted with silly effects instead of showing students what they are looking for - the movements made with the fans!!! Two of them are totally pointless from a student perspective. There is what appears to be a lovely trio of fans that you can't see at all because the fans are barely able to be studied in half the shots, let alone the perspective of ALL of the fans.

All told though, completely worth the money and I do recommend the rest of the DVD! Vulcan does some awesome work and there is nothing else of this kind out there.",1374537600,6,1227,4.400881057268722
