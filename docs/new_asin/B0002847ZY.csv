2068405,5,B0002847ZY,"I also find it odd that AMAZON does not distribute this fabulous program.  It is the funniest thing on television (if you can get BBC America).  I've given up on American televison; we just don't have good comedy writers anymore. Many of the episodes have me in tears they're so funny.  Maybe AMAZON UK carries all of the episodes; I certainly hope so.  Fantastic writing, directing and performances by all of the stars--even the guest stars.",1150675200,,442,4.776315789473684

2068417,5,B0002847ZY,Simple family communication and fun.  (Very rarely seen in today's families.)  Husband and wife digs are great fuel for my own marital events!,1373068800,,142,5.130434782608695
2068418,5,B0002847ZY,"My Family is so funny. In my opinion the oldest son makes the show. Yes, all the other actors do a great job too but, he is really funny. I and a lot of other people wish they would remake the series so we can see more shows.",1371081600,,225,3.7083333333333335
2068419,5,B0002847ZY,"Very funny - fast moving

2068420,5,B0002847ZY,"THis is one of the best comedies ever. Can't think of many I've enjoyed more.
It keeps you in stitches.",1358035200,,103,4.2
2068421,5,B0002847ZY,This is the funniest series. The wife looks like a disenchanted elf. They handle everything with the best humor. It is a very hard to find series.,1356566400,,146,4.444444444444445
2068422,4,B0002847ZY,I am a fan of this comedy show. They are good actors and there is always a laugh. Pure family entertainment. Loved it and would recommend it.,1355875200,,141,4.2592592592592595
2068423,5,B0002847ZY,i first saw this show on TV and since then i tried to find it but unfortunately i forgot the title. by chance i found out and i ordered it on amazon. it came on time and in perfect order so i am enjoying it.,1350518400,,207,3.6222222222222222
2068424,4,B0002847ZY,"This is one of my favourite comedies from the Beeb.  The episodes, while not having the most believable situations, still have me laughing.  I only wish there were some bonus materials included with the set.",1347235200,,207,4.885714285714286
2068425,5,B0002847ZY,"When it comes to comedy, I'm a hard sell.  Not much gets me laughing.  However, when it comes to My Family, I can't help but roar over the entire series.  Where does one start?  The dysfunctional lot are hilarious,especially Nick whose never-fading grin and antics leave you screaming.  I've already turned a few of my friends, and even my ex-husband, into My Family fans.  Let's just say even though I live in the states, it feeds my British heritage right jolly.  Kudos to the cast and the writers.",1322352000,,500,4.613636363636363
2068436,5,B0002847ZY,"The Harpers have to be the funniest family I've ever seen on television and I really enjoy having them here to watch whenever I want. They manage to take every cliche in sitcom-land and make them hilarious. Parents who snipe at each other yet still love each other. The dullard child, the genius child and the loose daughter. If you think you've seen every possible plot twist with these familiar characters then you need to watch this show to find out how wrong you are.",1301011200,,471,4.552941176470588
2068437,5,B0002847ZY,"We're enjoying watching My Family very much, it's extremely funny.  We wish we could purchase later seasons in a format usable in the United States.",1300147200,,148,4.92
2068438,5,B0002847ZY,"I bought this for my husband, he LOVES this show.  We discovered it on BBC America and he fell in love with it.  I was a little disappointed that there were only 8 episodes I believe on the first season and 13 (I believe) on the second season, but he has watched both seasons several times and he laughs hysterically every time.  Once they start falling in price I will purchase other seasons.  If you loved the Cosby's or Roseanne this is somewhere in the middle.  Great Show.",1265587200,,477,4.375
2068439,5,B0002847ZY,Great!  I love the Britcoms.  My Family ranks right up there.  I love all the characters.  I can't wait to get season 3.,1249084800,,120,4.086956521739131
2068440,5,B0002847ZY,In my opinion this is one of the best comedy shows. The whole family in this is hilarious and a bit dysfunctional in wonderfully funny way.,1224547200,,139,4.384615384615385
2068441,5,B0002847ZY,"My Family is a fantastic show ironically created by American writer Fred Barron. The cast, led by Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker, is absolutely brilliant. The situations the family faces are a bit exaggerated, but really do mirror a conventional family in the US or the UK. I'm happily anticipating the release of seasons 3 and 4 in the US soon. (Seasons 1 through 7 have already been released in the UK.) I hope Amazon will continue to offer the remaining seasons as they become available in the US.",1217376000,5,502,4.651685393258427
2068442,5,B0002847ZY,One of the best sit-coms on TV. Why can't the USA come up with any thing like it?,1215561600,2,81,3.5555555555555554

2068444,5,B0002847ZY,Fantastic British sitcom. It keeps me laughing the whole time for every episode.  I reccomend this to anyone who loves to laugh.,1168041600,7,128,4.818181818181818
2068445,5,B0002847ZY,This is one of the funniest shows that I've ever seen. I absolutely LOVE it!! I also find it odd that Amazon does NOT offer it for purchase. Please bring it here soon.,1151107200,,167,4.090909090909091
