8168098,3,B000MDH5R6,"The 2nd half is way better and more thrilling as Sunny plays the suave cop brilliantly (reminds you of the drunk and clever lawyer in Damini in'93). The action scenes are alright, although the special effects should have been toned down some; a little extra effort would have made it perfect. Overall, this is not a bad movie, especially since this becomes like a cat-and-mouse game, Sunny's dialogues and scenes with Gulshan Grover are totally witty. Surprisingly, Sunny does not even roar in this movie! Enjoy this one for Sunny!!",1304467200,,532,4.9222222222222225
