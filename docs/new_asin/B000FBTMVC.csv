8120444,5,B000FBTMVC,"I used this DVD before winning my state mrs pageant.  It is very helpful to see other people in the interview setting, walking in a swimsuit, and walking in a gown when I was preparing to do the exact same thing.

I would highly recommend this DVD and especially recommend it to new contestants.  The best way to learn is to watch others in action!",1266710400,,348,4.323076923076923
