2696956,4,B000KP62J8,"This is nothing new and different. I liked it though. Good performances from some familar faces before they made it big. I'd recomend this for anyone who loved the movie, or is a fan of period peaces and westerns.",1242691200,2,213,4.487179487179487
2696957,2,B000KP62J8,"Not up to the quality of the original ""Man from Snowy River"".  If you are looking for exciting horse races, don't.  But I was thoroughly pleased to see that Hugh Jackman has a large part in all 3 episodes.",1211673600,2,205,4.230769230769231
2696958,4,B000KP62J8,The item shipped quickly and was in good condition.  Too bad there aren't many more episodes on the disks - only Three doesn't seem like an awful lot.  But it was worth the price.,1199232000,7,179,4.235294117647059
2696959,4,B000KP62J8,"The product shipped quickly and was in great condition. The only problem was that the titles were wrong on the cover/did not match the descriptions of the episodes that were actually on the dvd.  However, the dvd itself was fine.",1199232000,3,229,4.725
2696960,5,B000KP62J8,"I really enjoyed this movie, I have the movie The MCGregor Saga -Race Day and it is nice to be able to add to movies that enjoyed watching on tv.",1193616000,4,145,3.8666666666666667
2696961,4,B000KP62J8,"I bought this dvd because I enjoyed the Snowy River movies, and I like Guy Pearce and Hugh Jackman, so I figured, ""Why not?""

The DVD consists of 3 episodes of the series set in Australia - The McGregor Saga - which, I gather, was created following the success of the Snowy River movies.  Those 3 episodes are ""Comeback"", ""The Grand Opening"", and ""Black Sheep"".  While I enjoyed the episodes quite a bit, it was a bit like jumping into the middle of something with little context, because of the nature of it being a TV series and these episodes not being the first.  I'd like to see more.  But, the thing that really got to me is that Guy Pearce doesn't appear ONCE in any of the three episodes.  His character is talked about, but is evidently 'away' for the period of these three episodes.  I guess they are trying to capitalize on his more recent success, but I don't care for the misleading tactics.  Hugh Jackman, of course, is great as always.

All of that said, I would recommend this to anyone interested in good family viewing (as long as their heart is not set on seeing Guy Pearce).  It's like an updated, less corny Bonanza, set in Australia.",1179619200,52,1155,4.431279620853081
2696962,5,B000KP62J8,"The movie was great. It's an Austrailan Western, which features a young

Hugh Jackman. If you are a western or Hugh Jackman lover, this is the perfect movie.",1175299200,13,157,4.607142857142857

2696967,5,B000KP62J8,"In the 90's we enjoyed the MCGregor Saga every Saturday afternoon and loved the series, its people and environs. Time passed, but
we never came all the way back from the Australia of pioneers. So much joy was had...to be able to purchase and see again, the few series episodes available, and return to a land so much akin to pioneer America...and we share the same spirit yet.

I only wish could buy ALL episodes of this series. Grand family entertainment and gorgeous photography of an unforgettable, grand country.",1379808000,,516,4.797752808988764

2696973,5,B000KP62J8,"Here is another three episode release of Snow River: The McGregor Saga, a western filmed in Australia, but aired in the USA on the former Family Channel, aka ABC Family. Guy Pearce who plays Rob McGregor was busy filming a movie, so a young unknown named Hugh Jackman was written onto the series for five episodes, who happens to take a shine to Rob's so-called girlfriend.

The Episodes are:

Comeback

The Grand Opening

Black Sheep

Even thought I would prefer a complete season release instead of a handful of episodes, I still enjoyed the DVD as I only paid five dollars for it.",1347148800,2,583,4.621359223300971
2696974,5,B000KP62J8,"Snow River: The McGregor Saga: A Different Breed of Cowboys consists of three episodes from the Australian TV show that aired in the USA on the former Family Channel, known today as  ABC Family. I wish that they would release complete seasons instead of a handful of episodes on a few DVDs, but I bought this DVD for only five dollars, so I'm not complaining.

The episodes on this single disc are:

Foundation Day

The Grand Duke

New Business",1347148800,5,444,4.569620253164557
2696975,3,B000KP62J8,"This box set contains 9 episodes from the start of Season 4 of the show.  It's not even the entire 4th season and nowhere on the packaging is it indicated.  I had to look things up on IMDB to sort out which disk was even first, as that's not listed either.  I loved this show when I was young and thought I was buying something else.",1346371200,9,333,4.015151515151516
2696976,3,B000KP62J8,"This show was okay but not as good as the original movie. I liked the characters in it but the story lines were very weak and slow,and not as exiting.",1323388800,,150,4.033333333333333
2696977,5,B000KP62J8,"Although the TV series was known in the US as Snowy River, the McGregor Saga, here in Australia it was called The Man From Snowy River and all the episodes are on DVD. I note the confusion about Guy's absence during the episodes that are on this specific DVD. The reason he was absent in these episodes at the time was because Hugh was brought in to replace Guy while he was filming LA Confidential in the US. Guy does return in later episodes and Hugh leaves. My guess is the cover of the DVD was probably used on all episodes of the series and it wasn't meant to mislead. I can't answer why the US version only showed 3 episodes on DVD. If you can get hold of the other DVDs, it is highly recommended family viewing with beautiful scenery. It was filmed around Mansfield in Victoria, beautiful scenic area of Australia.",1321401600,4,821,4.372549019607843
2696978,4,B000KP62J8,"This is a fun little show if you liked the series of Lonesome Dove or Little House on the Prairie. There are only three episodes on the volume, but I enjoyed them, especially seeing a young Hugh Jackman. But Guy Pearce, who is on the front of the box and listed as one of the main stars, is not in any of the three episodes.

2696982,5,B000KP62J8,"I repeat what others say that there should be more episodes of this series available.  Here you have three episodes that feature Hugh Jackman before his rise through X-Men and Swordfish and Australia.

You have the McGregor clan living where you were left off with the Snowy River movies, children, dad is getting older, though not any less vigorous.  Jackman comes back home after years away.  He is a friend of the family so, he is not fully tied in with them.  You can get caught up pretty fast with the first episode, Comeback, because Jackman is told about the whole McGregor clan and what they are doing.

In The Grand Opening, we have the family pitching in to help someone in their community while facing a trial of their own.  In Black Sheep, you will see two stories in one, both very interesting with their own message.

If the rest of the series was like this, it would be interesting to find the whole series available on DVD eventually.  Maybe one or another station will air these shows some time creating a market for them.  As already mentioned, Guy Pearce (The Time Machine) does not appear in any of the three episodes.

Great action, good story line, morals to the story and morals being mentioned and even taught.  TV in the USA needs more like these to give people a choice.",1251072000,3,1296,4.538793103448276

8158623,5,B000KP62J8,"The McGregor Saga is by far one of the best television shows i have seen, so I have no issues with the series itself and gave this DVD set 5 stars. However, the packaging and corresponding information about the DVD set is misleading. I saw no reference to the fact you are purchasing an incomplete set of Season 4 episodes. The final four episodes are not included in this set. I actually was looking for the first three seasons and because the word ""Trilogy"" was used on the package, assumed I was getting the earlier episodes. Will still keep the DVD set, but would encourage sellers to let buyers know exactly what they are buying with a more complete description.",1472515200,13,667,4.566666666666666
