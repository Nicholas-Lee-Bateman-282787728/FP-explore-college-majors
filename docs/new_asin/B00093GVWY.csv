2261938,5,B00093GVWY,"whether you lived through the '50s or not, this is an excellent historical document for the generations after us baby boomers and a gift of past memories for those of us who watched the show ""live.""",1120867200,4,198,4.527777777777778
2261939,4,B00093GVWY,"I waited with great anticipation for this set. It finally came, and when I popped it into my 1.5 year old DVD player, none of the disks in this set would play on a Toshiba player. I had to take them to another player I have, a newer one, a Panasonic.

THAT is scary. Still, I like the set.

You don't even have to like some of the stars on these disks; just seeing their reactions, their horror at being on ""This Is Your Life"", and their sometimes disingenuous reactions to people is great fun.

It is also sad to see some of these people who are no longer with us, such as Karen Carpenter and Jayne Mansfield. Karen appeared to be just an innocent, wide-eyed, all-American girl who rocketed to fame, only to die too soon. What a cutie. And Jayne really ""played"" her assets on TV, but you can tell that under the glitzy surface was a woman who cared about her family...and who was anything but dumb.

And there is Jack Cassidy, the ""hammy"" husband of Shirley Jones, and somebody who also died too soon.

Still, these are fascinating glimpses into the private lives of famous people. They sometimes look uncomfortable, there are lots and lots of pregnant pauses as people stumble for words.

Recommended, but...with caution.",1116547200,29,1223,4.536363636363636
2261940,5,B00093GVWY,"This is a nice compilation of the old Ralph Edwards series.

2261950,5,B00093GVWY,"I do remember this TYV show.  And how  I remember this  TV show! It was  differet to say the least. And it was  ""live"" TV when someone was surprised suddenly. Remember the  ones that did not want to go through with it? Ralph Edwards  set up the subject with  old-old friends, family membners  and  who knows  who else  coming out  from back stage when Ralph finally got back to the studio with the subject in the spotlight.. And there were some  we will remember  like ROY ROGERS  when many joked , ""even his horse TRIGGER cried"" when Roy seeing his  old  friends and long lost  familyu members. It was actually harsh  and almsot embarrasing. Yet, Edwards pulled it off each week and it was a top TV show. Copy-cat shows followed , including the ones by Dick Clark..but nothing like the original Edqrds did..""live""...with out editing out  anything said and done.

Settle back and watch as George Burns, Dick Clark, Betty White, Bobby Darin, Jayne Mansfield, Milton Berle (Uncle Miltie), and Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy among many others are surprised and have fun with host Ralph Edwards and see how many friends, former teachers, and co-workers show up to celebrate with them.",1341792000,,576,4.77

2261962,5,B00093GVWY,"I bought this specifically for the Lou Costello show. That was a very interesting show, and especially so for Abbott and Costello fans, but others in this collection are also fun to watch. It is like mini biogrophies with the main subject in the spotlight. We have not watched all of them yet, but are looking forward to them.",1284163200,,326,4.5423728813559325
2261963,4,B00093GVWY,"There were a total of 343 episodes in the original Ralph Edwards TV series ""This Is Your Life.""  Most episodes were half an hour long, minus commercials, so the entire collection would be over 150 hours long. In this DVD collection there are only 18 episodes (about 8 hours of video).  These episodes are a good cross section of the years the show was on the air, and they represent some of the most notable guests, or the most entertaining individual programs. If you're a collector of memorabilia from the early days of television, then this would be a good addition.  But if you are looking for a particular episode (about a particular person), check to make sure it is in the list before ordering the DVD.",1269907200,5,709,4.566929133858268

2261968,4,B00093GVWY,"Nostalgia buffs will love this DVD set which will bring back many memories.  Particularly ironic is the episode with Bobby Darin.  Darin had always believed that his older sister was the one responsible for his upbringing because his ""mother"" had been too ill to care for him.  This sister appears on the program with her own children who, to Darin's thinking, were his nieces and nephews.  Many years later, Darin learned, to his shock, that he never had an older sister and that she was, in fact, his own mother!!! It's very revealing to watch someone on a TV program participate in an outright lie although no one knew that when the show first aired.

2261970,5,B00093GVWY,"There was a time when television presented celebrities in a more positive light than we see now, and these shows hosted by Ralph Edwards treated viewers to rare insights into some of their favorite stars' lives. When you see how sweet Boris Karloff is, and learn how much Lou Costello donated to charities quietly, well, it made me miss those seemingly charming days when people treated each other with more kindness. I was delighted when I saw they were available on DVD and I can say that I will enjoy them over and over again. I hope you will, too.",1198540800,4,551,4.52

I remember watching a series of these when American Movie Classics was a great channel to watch (instead of the commercial-filled crap of movies from the 1970's and 80's it's morphed into) and seeing Jeanette MacDonald, Dorothy Lamour, Victor MacLaglen and Dore Shary to name a few.

2261972,5,B00093GVWY,"What a great collection, spanning the 50's through the 70's . Rare glimpse at celebrities being themselves which was rare (pre reality genre). I would love to purchase subsequent collections.",1176163200,3,191,5.4
2261973,5,B00093GVWY,"Ralph Edwards dates back to the days of radio and the original Truth or Consequences show in the 40s.  A segment from that show after WWII led to This is your Life on radio followed in the early 50s by the tv series that ran regularly for a decade and then sporadically for about 20 more years as specials.

Edward was always a little cornball, and ""Gosh, gee whiz, boy!"" for my taste, but his researchers and producers delivered with a product that stands the test of time in revealing the true personalities and hardships of celebrities from all walks of life.

You cannot find this kind of immediacy in biographical story telling anywhere today, even in the wonderful A& E bios or the less woderful, PR driven bios on E! TV.  Where else can you see Roy Rogers, the hero of millions of kids, tear up when he sees the old Dodge pickup that brought him to Hollywood in the depths of the depression!

Or the depth of feeling and high regard that people tyhroughout the industry hold for Betty White.  But the real gems are the ones like Jesse Owens, or the survivor of a Nazi death camp. . . the lesser known people - the unknown people - who can inspire us with their immediate attachment to history.

My one concern is that with the passing of Edwards recently, that Volume One may also be the last volume of these shows.  If that is the case, a teaching tool and an inspirational tool will be lost to many who might not otherwise make this kind of connection to greatness.",1143331200,18,1474,4.393382352941177
2261974,5,B00093GVWY,"Ralph Edwards' breakthrough series that showcased the extraordinary lives of famous folk has finally been brought to the small screen again. And we couldn't be happier. This three-disc collection features 18 tributes, and spans a variety of genres, decades and honorees. Our favorites, of course, come from the haze of Hollywood, and include Bette Davis (the reunion between she and Now, Voyager star Paul Henried, who recreates the film's legendary ""two cigarette"" finale, is stirring; Boris Karloff (the renowned actor is reunited with his Frankenstein make-up guru Jack Piece); Lou Costello (who refuses to shy away from the overwhelming grief over his young son drowning in the family pool) and Jayne Mansfield (whose honest emotionality belies her dumb blonde status). Yet the tales of the lesser-known World War survivors, Pearl Harbor hero Rear Admiral Samuel Fuqua and Holocaust survivor Hanna Bloch Kohner, are equally riveting. This remains an incredible piece of TV history that demands to be in everyone's home library, and we fervently hope that Ralph Edwards productions and R2 will release the rest of the shows.

2261976,5,B00093GVWY,"To be honest, I expected to watch this set & quickly sell it back on Ebay or Amazon.com but its so wonderful and greatly packaged, that its a keeper that I'll cherish. I'm a 51 year old baby boomer and it seems like all the greats were still alive when I was a kid and my knowledge and curiosity were limited back then and I didn't really know anything about these greats or appreciate them like I do now. Most of the people on this DVD made it on their own with their talent, charm & charisma not like the phoney no talented have no business to be considered celebrity types like Paris Hilton & the endless ilk.
Anyway, it was wonderful to see these wonderful people like Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Jayne Mansfield, etc., come alive with real people in a non rehearsed spontaneous setting not put on by some pr person being themselves with their loved ones, long lost friends, etc. Lou Costello was especially touching & he cracks one of the funniest improvised spontaneous cracks I've ever heard. Jayne Mansfield comes across like a really wonderful person as well and I can see why her daughter Marissa Haggerty comes off like a class act.
  This would make a wonderful gift for your parents & any baby boomer who misses the wonder years of yesterday.",1123891200,39,1262,4.506550218340611
