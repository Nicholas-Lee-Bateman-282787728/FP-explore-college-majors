8192527,5,B000PMGRS2,Watching this 22 years on from the withering days of Margaret Thatcher's premiership was well worth it. The 50 minute Granada production made in 1991 seems to be very accurate in it's portrayal of Maggie's downfall. There are some very good performances from other cast members who do an outstanding job in their parts. Well done to the person responsible for casting in this drama,1356912000,,381,4.876923076923077
8192528,5,B000PMGRS2,"Originally broadcast on British TV, this affecting drama follows the last days Margaret Thatcher (Sylvia Syms) spent as Prime Minister of Britain and leader of the Conservative Party, and how members of her Cabinet attempted to depose her from her position.

Margaret Thatcher's leadership of the Conservative Party took Britain out of the turbulent 1970's and into a period of war, strikes, and increasingly polarized social division. Loved and hated in equal measures, by the early 1990's, the knives were out and she was ousted from power in one of the most dramatic episodes in British political history.

A bravura performance by Sylvia Syms as Margaret Thatcher, along with strong performances by the entire cast. Featuring Keith Drinkel as John Major, and an especially astute performance by John Wood as Heseltine.",1285545600,,822,5.267175572519084
