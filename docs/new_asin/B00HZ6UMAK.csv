8637438,3,B00HZ6UMAK,"This is a very good DVD about stroke, but I bought one copy from two different sellers and each copy had the exact same defect.
There are two sections of information in this DVD and the first section played perfectly for me, but with each DVD after a few minutes into the second section the video stops, freezes, and after about 30 seconds it returns to the titles of the two sections. Now, what are the chances of that happening when you buy this DVD from two different sellers? I am now convinced that the manufacturer let all of the DVDs go out / be sold without
first doing any quality control checking to make sure that they weren't defective. It's a shame because this is the only video about stroke that I found on Amazon or eBay. And there's not nearly as much educational information TV shows these days as there used to be for some reason.",1474243200,,849,4.379746835443038
