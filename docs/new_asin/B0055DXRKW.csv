8458114,5,B0055DXRKW,"Fantastic video course on how to play 5 different Iron Maiden songs. Andy James has a grasp on this material like no one else (Note: Most web sites that offer this video seem to mis-credit the guitar instructor as Danny Gill, a great player in his own right, but it is actually Andy James on this dvd). If you close your eyes while he's playing at full speed against the backing tracks, you'd swear it was the guys from Maiden themselves playing for you. He's that good. His comprehension of tone, attack,proper whammy techniques, and phrasing is second to none. He could easily stand in for any one of Maiden's three guitarists and do them proud. This LickLibrary series has quite a few instructional videos featuring some of the greatest guitarists whose songs you could ever want to learn, and, if the other vids in this series are as good as this one, this makes LickLibrary the go-to company for rock star wannabes.",1382227200,,920,4.6503067484662575
