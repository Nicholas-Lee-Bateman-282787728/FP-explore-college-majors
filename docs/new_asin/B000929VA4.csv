2260700,5,B000929VA4,"""RahXephon- Complete collection"" repackages the 2003 7 disc TV series from ADV Films into a space saving thinpak collection. The orginal cover art is used but buyers won't get the dvd character booklets that accompanied the original release nor is the motion picture included. The series does come in a stylish collectors box with new artwork. If you missed RahXephon the first time don't hesitate to pick up this amazing series.

RahXephon was at first dismissed by some as a clone of Neon Genesis Evangelion with it the similar idea of a protagonist (in this case Ayato Kamina) reluctant to use the giant mecha RahXephon to fight otherworldly invaders. Those who watched the show realised thats where the similarities end.

RahXephon is the story of high schooler Ayato Kamina, a ordinary guy living in Tokyo, the last city on Earth that didn't fall to invaders the MU. The citizens of Tokyo are constantly aware that invasion could happen at any point and in the first episode it does. During the attack Ayato is seperated from his friends and meets up with another classmate Reika who takes him to an underground room where she awakens the RahXEphon and makes Ayato become one with the hulking mecha. Ayato is able to escape the city using the RahXephon where he soon learns Tokyo is actually controlled by the MU.

Over the course of the series Ayato has to unravel the truth of the world, come to grips with his own personal demons and decide how he is connected to the RahXEphon.

The series does a great job of storytelling. The first episode quickly throws many questions at the viewer and has you wondering just what is the truth in the world of RahXephon. The pacing of the story is excellent. Viewers are given just enough answers to questions to keep them satisfied while having new questions crop up. The show will keep you guessing until the end.

A phenomenal anime that has action, romance, comedy, big mecha and lots of mystery- truly something for everyone. If you haven't seen RahXephon yet, what are you waiting for?

2260703,3,B000929VA4,"I first watched this series in early 2004 when I was a freshman in high school and since then I've always had a desire to finally see the last half of the series.

Rahxephon has so much potential, but fails to realize it because of rushed character development, especially towards the end, and just plain bad storytelling. Much of what is done with the story is kind of tacked on at the end, never really providing any kind of real answers or sense of finality. The movie that comes with this is probably the best at explaining the story and filling in the many plot holes from the TV show, but that's assuming that you've watched the TV show in it's entirety.

Honestly, I was really disappointed with this show. I could go on and on. What exactly and who the Mu are is never really fully explained, and neither is their motive for attacking earth. Lord Bahbem and his motives for creating the RahXephon and wanting to ""tune the world"" is never given more than a few sentences of dialogue. And the story and the pace that they reveal secrets is really odd. It starts out incredibly slow, and then in the last few episodes, most of the secrets are finally divulged, albeit very quickly.

I would love to see a remake with this series. Where the conflict with the Mu is explained better, and therefore I have a reason to root for Ayato and have a real sense of conflict and tension. I would love to have a more concentrated and focused love story. The romance between Ayato and Haruka feels really forced and as they become more and more intimate with their feelings you have to kind of wonder as the viewer if there is just something off screen going on for them to be that way that you're just not privy to.

All in all, this is a good series, but it just doesn't live up to it's potential. I'm disapointed in it for sloppy storytelling, resulting in a beautiful anime that fails to make me care about what's going on.",1373241600,,1919,4.397183098591549
2260704,3,B000929VA4,"Over the years of researching new anime to watch, Rah Xephon was a show that kept popping up in various lists and has received a lot of praise. I had always wanted to watch it but never really got around to it but finally I found this set new on rightstuf for 20 bucks.

The set itself is all the discs stacked on top of each other in 2 thick plastic cases, wrapped in a cardboard sleeve. Pretty shoddy but its the entire series and movie for a good price so I'll overlook it.

I have seen a lot of people compare this series to evangelion and I must say that is pretty fair, but trust me this is a pale imitation, although it definitely sets itself apart enough to not be considered a ripoff.(If you are looking for Eva clones Aquarion is even better than this...)

 The story has good concepts but never really knows what its trying to do. Is it a love story? Well yeah but the tv series is very vague on that fact although the movie definitely focuses more on that aspect. Some kind of religious or thought provoking message? If it is, that message is very muddled and unclear. Is it a giant robot show? NO. If you didn't like eva but enjoyed the fights, you will really hate this because the battles range from short and strange to non-existant. There is very little character development to the show. Well, they try to have character development for certain characters but they barely see screen time and it leaves the viewer with a very cold and boring cast. There were only a couple episodes that were a bit moving.

I enjoyed the overall concept of alien invaders creating their own bubble on earth where they control people and time is slower. I will say that Rah Xephon is a great sci-fi show, but all the confusion and different things that its clearly trying to do to top eva make it a huge mess in my opinion.

The animation is mediocre although the actual art design is nice. Studio bones always produces some nice looking characters but they've definitely done better since, and I feel that the compilation movie almost seems that even they kinda didn't like the way the show turned out. The score was very mediocre too. especially for a show with a lot of musical themes.

Overall, I didn't hate this show, but I will say that I will never re-watch it.",1356739200,,2268,4.398568019093079
2260705,3,B000929VA4,"First off, let me tell you what you're buying. This is the complete series, all 26 episodes on 7 disks, plus one more for the Movie, which is a retelling of the series. They come in two spindle packs, that means the disks are stacked on top of each other. There are a handful of special features including interviews with the English cast and Japanese cast, along with production sketches, clean opening and ending songs, a music video, and trailers.

Ayato Kamiya is an ordinary Japanese high school student, until he is extracted out of his home town and it is revealed that all he's known is a lie set up by aliens called the Mu. With the RahXephon, he battles giant monsters called Dolems created by the Mu, and he'll save all the other humans who are still trapped by the aliens.

On the technical level, this is a good show. It has good animation. Good voice acting. And if you tracked down all the plot threads, you'd see they make sense. But for me, and this is just my opinion, I never connected with these characters. Boring, unlikable characters early on, become important to the plot later, and the mildly interesting characters drop off, or never grow more.

I watched the first eight episodes in quick succession, because  I was interested in what they were building. But, by Episode 18, when the series decided to start climaxing, I wasn't engaged anymore. It felt like there was nothing to lose. I didn't connect with any of the characters. Plus, most of the Dolem battles are in the sky, or out on the open ocean, so the threats never felt real. And by the time the threat got real, I wasn't caring anymore. The last stretch of episodes became a slog. This anime was an exercise in making a complex web of relationships, but not complex characters.

As for accusations about RahXephon copying Eva. I think it's apples and oranges. There's a young man, an older woman, an emotionless girl, an organization, and a mind twisting ending. Did I describe Eva, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya?

To sum up, it's an Okay series, but very low on my list of series I want to watch again. I recommend finding some place to stream it, or rent it, before you commit to buying. 3-out-of-5",1355011200,,2195,4.558375634517766
2260706,4,B000929VA4,RahXephon is a really cool anime. It has a lot in common with Evengelion. The whole kid uses a giant humanoid robot to change the world to the way he wants it to be thing is pretty much the story. The anime has a lot of great characters and very good animation. The voice actors are all good as well. I would give it 5 stars if there weren't as many plot holes and if it had a better ending. Other than that. This anime is a good watch riding on the soaring wings of Evangelion. I can't say Evangelion is one of my top 10 favorites or anything either. The giant robot genre isn't really my thing. But both are really good and worth seeing. I say go for it.,1350432000,,656,4.015267175572519

The shipping was suppose to be faster than when i received it.
I found it very dissapointing that the DVD collection i paid for and waited since September 4 (as seen above) arrives and instead of it having 8 disc's i got a DVD cover with 1 disc that contained the last 3 episodes when its suppose to include 23 or 24 episodes.

As i still want this DVD collection Rahxephon - Complete Collection what do i do with it. As this isn't the product i ordered what is the best option for me to do? Send it back and get the whole collection sent to me. Or wait for the rest of the collection?

2260708,5,B000929VA4,"Love this series and I am so happy I finally have it.  It was a nice surprise that this set comes with the series plus the movie as well, I did not like the way they set up the case but hey its still great and looks amazing and favorite voice actor is in it so even more awesome",1348704000,,278,3.711864406779661
2260709,5,B000929VA4,"As of 2012 Rahxephon remains one of the all around best anime of the 21st centary thus far.
However many (including some on this very site) claim that the whole series is invalid because it is apparently oh-so very much like Evangelion. Whatever my opinions on that series are (don`t like the tv series, find the rebuild films quite good.) dosen`t matter because the comparisons between the two equal  a small amount of jot notes. But something as slopply written and unorignal as code geass gets shelves of awards and acclaim. There truly is no justice in the anime fan world.

But all the fan outcry much as It bothers me can`t destroy this brilant show. If evangelion is this brute force of ideas attacking you, Rahxephon is a light that slowly almost unnoticbly consumes you. It is incredibly subtile in both it`s ideas (there is a brillant metaphor involving the main charecter and a bird that I didn`t relize until long after the fact.) aand ploting. Every question involving the series mytholgy is answered. However even if you are given the pieces they excpect you to put them togheter. Don`t go in expecting a summer cruise.

The charecterzation isn`t as subtle but it is just as wonderful. Proving depth without angst is possible and it really is the point of the show. The tone is really wonderfully strange and exotic. Most if not all episodes have terific action scenes (The animation is a decade later still amazing)but there the cherry, not the cake.

Everyone still knows that one person who finds anime to be a waste of time. Show them Rahxephon. It`s a true masterclass in storytelling beating any of the crap mainstream Hollywood studios or stupid, popular shows like Breaking Bad  attempt or undeserved nerd overlords Joss Whedon or Daemon Lindeloft could ever hope to make. It could change there view on ``those Japanese cartoons``. forever.

P.S. Many reviewers have said that Rahxephon will be remebered due to it supposed similariteies to evangelion. If that turns out to be the case it will be due to pepole`s arrogance rather than the show itself.",1344988800,,2073,4.825352112676057
2260710,5,B000929VA4,the entire series has a great story line and great visual effects. the whole series is very captivating and once you start watching you won't want to stop till you completed the series.,1344211200,,185,4.636363636363637
2260711,5,B000929VA4,"First off, the only truly bad thing I can say about this is that it is in a Stackpack. Other than that, I loved this anime. I don't see why people compare it to NGE (Neon Genesis Evangelion), cause the only thing they have in common is that the ending is really confusing(and the main characters have parent issues). The characters are really amazing, I loved everyone of them(or hated them). The mecha fights were not VERY good, but they were passable. Overall, this is one of my favorite Mechas, only behind Gundam and Code Geass.",1320278400,,532,4.552083333333333
2260712,4,B000929VA4,"Well, I was rather resistant to try this show out. My main problem was that it is so often compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion, which I cannot honestly say I like (in fact I really disliked it, but I won't get into why here, my objective is not to start a flame war or anything). So I was really iffy on trying this show out with all the comparison. But to me, other than teens+mecha, it really was nothing like NGE.

First off, the art and music in this show is quite nice, it certainly makes watching it even more of a treat. The dub is also perfectly fine filled with ADV familiars that all do a good job. But the characters rather stuck out to me, they had their moments of being, for lack of better word, ""emo"", but they didn't just stick on that note the entire time (it was usually very brief and totally warranted). They changed as the series progressed and became more interesting with each episode. Story-wise the series also hints at something larger going on, partly meaning seemingly pointless symbolic bs all over the place, however, only those who actually care can rewatch the series specifically for it. There is symbolism, but the show resists beating the viewer over the head with it. In a first viewing, it can be a perfectly enjoyable show, if not slightly confusing at times (one that made me run to the internet to find out some minor details here and there, but with no problems understanding the overall story). There is more to symbolism going on in the show, the story makes revelations later that make earlier parts of the show make sense, certainly requiring its viewer to be paying attention the whole time and for those who care, almost certainly demanding a rewatch. Fair warning, this is not a show you watch to just sit back and turn your brain off.

This is a great show that's really engaging and isn't centered around mostly episodic mecha fights or missions for most of the show the way NGE tended to be. I really see little to compare with NGE other than genre, so those fretting about that, try watching RahXephon anyway, for me it was what NGE should have been and I really enjoyed myself with both the characters and the story.

Now, my complaint with this release is that ADV/Section23 released the show in stackpack style. Stackpack is when they put several discs all on one spindle. In particular, this is two stackpacks put together and then into a paper sleeve (if you ever saw the old Bandai Escaflowne set, imagine that except with stackpacks and not much nicer thickpacks). There are 8 discs total and the last one is the movie. Odds are you can get this show in another thinpack (which may not have the movie) and if you want the movie, you should be able to get that for really cheap on the side.

I highly recommend this series, just perhaps not in this particular collection.",1306886400,6,2829,4.51953125
2260713,2,B000929VA4,"*This was originaly posted as a review for the Rahxephon thinpak collection, but once I realized that my review applied to this particular release, which includes the movie (the thinkpak doesn't), I deleted the review as so not to mislead anyone. This is a re-post of the same review on the product to which it actually applies*

When Rahxephon made its American debut in 2003, it quickly became one of the most talked-about series to emerge out of the twenty-first century. While many despised the series for its disturbing resemblance to EVA, its epic story, cryptic undertones, and appealing visual style captivated many-a-fan. Like or not, Rahxephon was taking the anime world by storm, so I felt obligated to give it a try.

I want to begin by stating that I am not an EVA fan. I respect the show for its intelligence, and fascinating concept, but on a surface-level the show never engaged me. That being said, the most notable thing about RAH is its resemblance to EVA. In fact, when any one mentions the series, it's usually the first point to come up. And yes, they are similar, to the point where no one even bothered to hide it. You have the tortured adolescent (of course), the mysterious girl, a host of Alien invaders, a giant mecha (that only the tortured adolescent can pilot, mind you), and lastly, the over-arching ""plan"" for humankind, which doesn't reveal itself until the series' final episodes. I don't have a problem with similarities among stories, because all stories feed off each other. The point is to take a theme or idea and reinvent it, make it new, while preserving the core of the original. But RAH doesn't attempt to reinvent any of its borrowed material. The only notable addition to the story is its themes about music and ""tuning the world."" In theory, it's an interesting concept, but it is treated with silly pretentiousness. One of the worst things about RAH is that it tries so desperately to convince itself of its own ""greatness"". An intelligent work carries itself with quiet confidence, but RAH is anything but confident, with its constant reiteration of plot points, bombardment of trying-to-be-deep dialogue, and half-baked philosophies. The show doesn't believe in itself, or its audience, which is unfortunate.

Another problem with the show is its characters. First off, there are way too many, and I commend the show for its attempt to develop most of them in some meaningful way. Sadly, though, the bulk of them remain uninteresting, even after we know their history and significance to the overarching plot. In fact, so much energy is wasted on plot disclosure and the origins of minor characters that we get to know very few of them on an intimate level. The show is confused, having no idea on who to focus on. Characters move in and out of the story, sometimes disappearing for unforgivably long stretches, only to reappear as major players when the writers find it convenient.

I want to talk a bit about the animation, which has received near-universal praise, even from non-fans. The art-work is beautiful. The colors are bright and crisp, and the characters are well-drawn. However, everyone has virtually the same face, and there is little emotion conveyed in their expressions. Not to mention the overall lack of movement. Basically, the characters stand there and talk. Their mouths move, they blink occasionally, but they remain still as statues. There are some bright spots, of course, but they are few and far between. The mecha-battles are also stiff, lacking energy and dramatic power. Instead of being exhilarated, as I was while watching EVA from time to time, I was bored.

Voice-acting wise, the series is well-done on both ends. The original Japanese track is good, and the dub is also worth noting. I'm not a purest when it comes to subs, so I usually watch the dub, as long as it doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the series. Most of the roles are well-filled by veteran ADV actors, and considering some ridiculous dialogue about ""blue blood"" and ""Mulian invaders"" they do adequately enough with their respective roles.

The DVD collection is well-designed, with nice packaging. Each disc comes complete with extras, including the standard previews, production sketches, and clean openings and closings. Scattered throughout the collection are interviews with the English-speaking voice actors, and on the final disc, there is a short interview with the Japanese cast and crew. It's all pretty standard, but the interviews are an added bonus for those who are interested in voice-acting. Also included in the collection is the Rahxephon movie, which really isn't a movie at all, but a bunch of clips from the show that were crammed together in an attempt to retell the story, with segments of new animation sprinkled here and there. If you value your brain, you will NOT watch the movie, which is a tangled mess. The new sequences are melodramatic and poorly acted, almost to the point of self-parody. Avoid at all costs. Shred it. Burn it. Whatever. Just don't watch it.

I know it looks like I've been pretty hard on Rahxephon, but the show does make a genuine effort at being great. It really tries, and its sincerity is endearing, but it's just too flawed to recommend. The series would have benefited from a tighter story with fewer characters and more of an emphasis placed on character animation. Sad to say, the show comes up short of its praise.",1302134400,7,5433,4.886117136659436
2260714,5,B000929VA4,"There's not much I can add that has not already been said, but I'm another individual who preferred RahXephon immensely to Evangelion, to which it will always be compared. However, I do not think that RahXephon is ""Eva-lite"" or somehow less complex or profound. You will be unlikely to catch everything the first time around -- there are many subtle surrealist images, specifically around Mishima Reika, and RahXephon should be commended for its beautiful use of the visual metaphor.

However, as to which between Eva and Rah you will prefer (and you are likely to love one and hate the other), I think it's a worldview question. Do you want to see an anime which portrays the world as ultimately frightening, desolate, and incomprehensible -- which ultimately derails the fragile hopes that flawed humans attempted to build? (Eva). Or, are you the type of person who thinks that even though the world is a difficult place, it is, too, full of beauty, majesty, and profound joy, and when people fall down, they get up again and dust themselves up? (RahXephon). Endless philosophical treatises have been written on both accounts. Eva strikes me as Pascal's ""Man is only great in his capacity to recognize his wretchedness."" I just personally didn't agree. That said, hopefully this breaking down of their views on life will help you choose which one you identify with.

Another thing about RahXephon, if you are considering viewing it, is that it is profoundly affected by its choice in music -- it has the same kind of profound connections to Jazz as Cowboy Bebop, albeit a very different kind of jazz that forgoes the sax and emphasizes the piano and haunting vocals. If you like an anime that is codependent on its brilliant soundtrack, you will love it (Escaflowne comes to mind in this category too, it's up there with Yoko Kanno masterpieces). Even the philosophical implications of the series are caught up in musical terminology -- being in harmony or dissonance with others, with the true ""voice of yourself"" (which in this series is labeled as the voice of god, because it gives one the power to transform things), and being able to use those harmonies to harmonize the entire universe to the ultimate ""song"" of one's choice.

In the end, I found this a profoundly moving portrait of adolescence, contrasted with realities of adulthood, and how people's hopes and dreams progress or get lost as they go through the events of their lives.",1282953600,,2446,4.875

If you get Rahxephone Complete Collection I would tell you not to buy The Movie, The Movie is only made up of seans from the Searies Collection and nothing new.",1247875200,,445,3.795698924731183
2260716,5,B000929VA4,"It sounds silly, but watched RahXephon as an ""alternative"" to EVA because I'm actually a little turned off by the constant Evangelion hype that I hear and read about. I read several reviews that described RahXephon as ""Evangelion done right"". I have no idea if it's true or not, but I decided to give this anime a look before Eva just to go against the flow.

This show is phenomenal, but it took me a while to come to this realization, mainly because the story is very intricate and requires a good deal of thought to comprehend. It is not a series that you can watch casually and enjoy. I had to re-watch the ending to try and piece things together. After I had time to digest it, I realized that I really liked it, and more than that, I was impressed by the sheer quality of this show, from production values to English voice work.

The first thing this series had going for me was the character designs and the animation quality. Both get very high marks. The characters are believably conceived and drawn and lends this series to an almost live action feel, for me anyway. Out of any anime I've watched, this one feels the most targeted to intelligent adult audiences and its real-world characters emphasized this fact. The music is also very unique and memorable and gives the show a similarly mature touch.

The plot line in this show is quite complex. It ranges from mystery to sci-fi to action to romance, and in my opinion does an excellent job at intertwining them all. It is not so much a ""giant mecha"" show as a show about the inherent worth of humanity. After I began to piece it together, I really, really enjoyed the irregular romantic story developed in RahXephon. It was very unique and enjoyable to watch develop. I also found the references to 2012 and Mayan culture particularly interesting, since there is a lot of hype about the year 2012 right now. The idea of re-tuning the world was intriguing to me and is actually a theme that I've heard before regarding the year 2012.

Like a number of other shows I've seen, it starts by focusing in on one character and then expands the story to take in a large number of side characters and eventually expands until it is literally cosmic in nature. And being cosmic in nature, RahXephon comments on humans place in the cosmos, and caps off great tragedy with great hope, which I really appreciated.

As far as an age rating is concerned, I'd rate this one as 18+. There's not too much objectionable here...there is a scene where Ayato is dreaming and the Haruka in his dream attempts to seduce him, as well as a few shots of Quon in her underwear and the classic beach bikini episode, but there was nothing that I was really offended by. The series does not make a point out of fanservice, but the female characters are well-proportioned and there are a couple of potentially awkward moments that pass quickly.

A highly recommended series that stands on its own as a great work.",1243123200,,2946,4.5386064030131825

 Why only three stars...well the anime is great, but not outstanding, and this is nothing original. Aliens...teenager is the only one capable of piloting mecha. Yet it is worth watching and there is some replay value to it as well.",1239148800,,589,4.444444444444445
2260718,3,B000929VA4,"This was yet another interesting Mecha Anime that I came across.  I've noticed I tend to prefer the far more mechanical Mechs you see in things like Mechwarrior, but the Animes seem to favor a more organic or humanoid styled Mech.  Maybe it's to make them seem like they're more than just a machine, which is the case in the instance of RahXephon.  Despite the fact I'm not too big on the creature designs the stories are still very good and quite enjoyable!  Don't get me wrong, the creatures are still drawn quite well and the rest of the art is very nice.

We are first brought into the world of Ayato Kamina.  He seems kind of out of touch with reality, but in most Anime's like this the main character has a destiny to fulfill.  Like other Anime's I've watched the characters are usually between the ages of fourteen and eighteen and in this case Ayato is seventeen.  We see this used commonly in things like Serial Experiments Lain, Last Exile, Burst Angel, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I guess that's the perfect age for things to get interesting.  Also like many others I've seen so far start off with a seemingly normal world, lively and normal... except for our out of touch main character.  However, there's a major twist because the world has pretty much been destroyed and the only city left is Tokyo.  The world's population has been reduced to a mere twenty-three million!  How could this happen?  Apparently otherworldly beings called the Mu attacked Earth, but only Tokyo managed to survive.  As in most other Anime's not everything is as it seems... an air of mystery comes about and something is amiss with the world.  The synopsis would technically be much greater than that, but I don't want to give away the mystery or the awe of the world you get to enjoy through this Anime.

I suppose this Anime parallel's Neon Genesis Evangelion quite a bit, but with a major pro in my book.  At the end of this series we get at least a decently logical conclusion!  They don't go off into any overly philosophical episodes that may or may not have anything to do with the series.  This story really does begin and end within the series and we really didn't quite get that in Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Do I think that RahXephon is better?  Actually... no.  I think Neon Genesis Evangelion was a much more profound series, along with being much deeper and I liked the premise behind their Mechs a lot more as well.  Despite all the borrowing and influence from various other Animes I think RahXephon managed to construct a decently original universe for us to enjoy and not feel like it's a blatant rip off of another series.

I really did enjoy the world they created for this Anime, but there are a few misgivings that I think really held it back from reaching its true potential.  A major downside to this series is the huge cast.  It feels like the normal twenty-six episode length is far too short to encompass all the kinds of character depth we need.  At the end I was left with too many questions about Ayato's mother for example.  She's a very mysterious character and they explain a lot, but I think there should've been a lot more for us to see.  There are some expertly written twists and turns throughout the series, but the drama is really what drove my interest in this show.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit, but like many of the Mecha shows I've seen thus far it seems like they force the action sequences in some episodes.  As if they need to fit at least one action sequence into EVERY episode.  There is plenty of drama and story to build on that they don't necessarily need this.  In fact I wanted more of the dramatic elements and background story of some of the characters.

An interesting thing with this DVD set is that there are extras on every disc and these include various interviews with the creators and voice actors.  In the end I enjoyed this series quite a bit.  Not as profound as some other series I've seen, but it's quite good while it lasts.  The last parts involving the God designer character are brilliant and that's the main part where you get a taste of some philosophical notions.  If you enjoy a good Mecha with a complex story then I would recommend RahXephon.  Just be forewarned that the cast is unnecessarily huge and you won't find out everything about every character.  This is unfortunate, but I can't deny that the world and story are still good in the end.

There's no manga to go with it either, and that's already a sign pointing towards a chaotic plot line. It's almost like it was being written while still in production. It's also surprisingly emo and makes too many failing attempts at being philosophical n such (a common anime thing, but most at least have a foundation to which the idea is represented). So, this isn't an anime I'll watch again when I can just go see the very anime it copied off of, but is well worth the time and money, Evangelion.",1217462400,2,601,4.375
2260720,4,B000929VA4,"One of the keys to Raxephon is a much friendlier story for an american audience compared to Eva (I loved them both, but saw Eva first so it holds a warm place for me.)

Ayato is about a zillion times better than Shinji.

I agree the themes are the same and Evaxephon dot com clearly points this out so I won't even bother to go there. (It hardly seems worth getting upset over... especially when kids are starving all over the world... hehe getting angry over anime seems pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things.)

Forgive me if this is pretty abstracted from the story... I'm trying to not give too much away to anyone interested in picking this up.

Without spoiling it I would say that love story is complete, even though it isn't traditional in its final stages.

There are some plot twists in the love story that are genuinely satisfying. The twists answer a lot of questions about Reika's significance and Haruka's ""seemingly"" unprovoked (and often unacknowledged) concern for our hero Ayato.

There is a lot here that is good.
The story is well delivered.
The characters are deep an interesting.
The crisis has a great bit of time distortion, and the story plays head games with this very well.

If one had never seen Eva: In the end this is really hard to say anything bad about.

The animation is solid and in some cases just breathtaking.
The production quality is very high.
The growth of each character in the story is obvious... and reasonable... and therefore believable.

There isn't much, if any, fan service in the way of visuals, BUT there are some characters that have a very sultry demeanor that is very appealing. Some of the characters hit the sexy buttons on all eight cylinders, without showing a bunch of skin... that is really solid feat if you ask me. Less is more in this one when it comes to fan service.

I didn't give this 5 stars because, as good as it was... there was something about it that felt a tad empty. Almost like some pieces were unresolved. I'm not sure. Perhaps it was the music? Kinda haunting and menacing... I'm not sure. What I do know is simple, in the end I wasn't moved. Satisfied but not emotionally shaken from my seat, if you know what I mean.

I borrowed this from a friend and now that I have seen it I'm buying it, so that should really be enough to tell you what I think of it. It belongs in my collection, right between Eva and Noein.",1204848000,2,2399,4.454337899543379

2260722,3,B000929VA4,"I'm really torn when it comes to RahXephon. See, I did something stupid... I saw Evangelion and fell in love with it. Hungry for something similar, I read the glowing reviews for RahXephon and bought it, hoping for another intelligent, profound series. On my first viewing (too soon after Eva) I hated it. No, I despised it! It blatantly 'borrows' a ton of ideas, themes, scenes, and dialogue from Eva. Those who say it doesn't aren't looking. (A site called EvaXephon has 17 pages worth of these similarities for those interested.) As my Eva-mania cooled down, and I reflected on Rah, I thought perhaps I'd been too harsh. So I recently re-watched it. This time I didn't find the similarities as disturbing. In fact, I actually found myself enjoying this series, especially towards the end. But I still found many flaws that detract from it. First, I will discuss those flaws, but end on a high note with what this series does right.

FLAWS:

Rah's biggest flaw is its poor execution of PRaT (Pace, Rhythm, and Timing). This series jumps and jerks around with wild shifts in pace, little rhythm to its edits and narrative flow, and a lack of timing in execution. Ep. 11 is a good example: The viewer is thrust immediately into a fight between the Xephon and a Dolem with no explanation of how this came about. The Dolem ""swallows"" Xephon, sending the hero, Kamina Ayato into an alternate dimension-like state. This is one episode borrowed from Eva, but the real problem is lack of setup. To believe in the altered state that is happening to the hero, we have to have a setup and a flow of events. Another example is the train sequence in the final episode. Again, this idea is ripped from Eva...  but this scene makes no sense in regards to the rhythm of Rah's narrative and sticks out like a sore thumb.

I'm extremely sensitive to PRAT when it comes to art (long series especially). Series that flow logically have more impact and make it easier to get involved. Rah's lack of good PRaT shows a hackjob on the part of its creators who had many good ""ideas"", but weren't able to put them together in logical, rhythmic order.

Rah's second flaw is in its cast. Rah has a monstrous cast, but the problem is with the focus of the series. Rah was intent on bringing every character into the mix with a story and multiple, intertwining relationships. The problem with this is that characters who seem important early on disappear for episodes, and characters that seem unimportant early on dominate the later episodes. They really needed more episodes in order for this method to work. Without them, they should've just focused on a few. It's not that these stories are bad, but just rather shallow due to the lack of time spent developing them.

Rah's third flaw is in its characters. I thought most were poorly conceived. Eva, by comparison, went to great lengths developing characters with specific personalities. Eva's characters always acted and interacted in an honest manner regarding their personality. But Rah's characters often seem wooden. Ayato especially has as much flavor and personality as cardboard. I neither love or hate him. My apathy towards him is reflective of his apathy towards everything. I think the most interesting characters are under-developed. Quon is always intriguing, but she's never given a proper story. Megumi is a fun personality that fades into the background, only to emerge too late. In the end, I just didn't feel like I really knew any of the characters, and just didn't care what happened to them. This might just be a matter of personal taste, but I think Eva had superior characterization, even if their characters were often unlikable.

Rah's fourth flaw is how contrived much of its drama is. This goes back to PRAT and lack of development. Ep. 18/19 is a prime example; Ayato and Hiroko develop a relationship VERY quickly late in 18. The ending of 19, which should be the most poignant in the series, instead seems mawkish and sloppy due to the dearth of story development. A series for audiences with any kind of attention span can't just arbitrarily introduce characters and relationships, give them a ""tragic ending"" and expect intelligent viewers to fall for it.

Rah's fifth flaw is in its extra-contextual elements. Its ""philosophy"" is so trite as to be laughable. I especially got a chuckle out of Ayato's ""I am me because I will remain me because I am myself"" talk, which has been recycled to death. if Rah succeeds as a sci-fi narrative, it fails miserably as a work with something to say. I can't help but think these aspects were thrown in for pretentious reasons solely because Eva had them.

Rah's final flaw is in its ""big picture"". Rah has some great parts and ideas but as a ""complete work"" it comes up short. Great albums are those where each song serves a larger purpose in the structure and context of the album. Series are the same with episodes. Episodes exist both singularly, but also as one piece to a bigger puzzle. In Rah's case, many pieces just don't fit. And while they may work as stand-alones, they don't enhance the overall work, and this again goes back to poor PRAT.

STRENGTHS:

With all the negatives I had to say about Rah, I still think it works well as an interesting piece of science fiction. Here are what I consider its greatest strengths:

Rah's style is a rich tapestry influenced by a variety of art (music, literature, visual arts, mythology and culture). These aspects are integrated seamlessly into the narrative, making it unique and captivating stylistically. Visually, it's gorgeous with very fluid animation. The character and mech designs are phenomenal, with great color usage that's thematically relevant. The visuals evoke a type of mesmeric painting, while the music evokes a sense of enchanting mystery and nostalgia. The series bases much of its story on time and music, so this was a crucial aspect, and it works. Literature, religion, myths, and cultures are also used to shape Rah's style. The RahXephon page on Wikipedia discusses many of its influences in terms of art and culture. It's really fascinating, and perhaps the most alluring reason to watch Rah.

I think Rah actually succeeds extremely well as a pure sci-fi narrative. Many of the ideas it uses were interesting until the end. The series gets more compelling in the later episodes. From ep. 19 on it's hard not to get engrossed in the story, wondering how it's going to end. The final episodes are a whirlwind of revelations and one big twist after another. It's enough to leave any viewer's head spinning. Rah's narrative is fairly complex and worth dissecting for those who aren't satisfied with the surface aspects. The character relationships, while a bit shallow, are also fun to follow, to see how they conclude.

The finale is extraordinary in its artistic vision. If I hadn't seen End of Evangelion before seeing Rah, then it would certainly fall under the mind-blowing category. They have a bit of a ""been there, done that"" feeling, but it's extremely well executed and visually stunning. While Rah will probably leave you with some questions, it resolves most of its main narrative in a fairly complete and conclusive manner.

The voice acting is also exceptional. In rare anime fashion, the dub is almost equal to the sub. Though I still give the edge to the sub (some GREAT performances from its cast), the dub is adequate for those who despise subtitles.

CONCLUSION:

As one critic stated, ""Rah is like Eva lite: Tastes good but less filling."" For me, Rah is a good but very flawed series. It's a bit pretentious and fails intellectually, but succeeds with its imaginative sci-fi narrative and rich, vibrant visual style. It has enough depth to give the viewer something to contemplate, but isn't nearly as demanding of its audience as Eva. While I still consider Eva a vastly superior artistic work, Rah is a good alternative for those who find Eva too complex, depressing and demanding. This is perhaps why most either love Rah and hate Eva or vice versa. One works more as fun, light entertainment (Rah), while the other works better as a mature, complex work of art (Eva). For casual audiences, Rah would likely be preferred. For those (like myself) who enjoy a challenge, Eva is a deeper, more rewarding work.

I do feel that both works deserve a lot of merit for what they accomplished. Despite their similarities, the essence of both in what they (tried to) achieve are quite different. I've yet to experience a visual work as endlessly fascinating as Eva. But for those who didn't latch onto it emotionally or intellectually, Rah might be just what you're looking for.",1184284800,33,8665,4.804026845637584
2260723,5,B000929VA4,"A friend of mine picked up the first disk when it was still coming out on a whim. We sat down to watch it, fearing it would be like EVA and have the world end as a puddle of tang.

We were so very mistaken.

Rah-xephon runs on many of the same lines as EVA, with many episodes that are almost copies. But the plot, and the storyline are so much more compelling and captivating that it is astounding. Things are actually explained with enough detail to answer some of your questions and enough clues to let you find the others on your own. The ending actually makes sense. The characters, even those that fall under the category of 'bad guys' still have such personalities that you love the character even if you hate what they do. The English voice acting is amazing. Truthfully I can't say enough good things about this series. I highly recommend this to anyone that did not like EVA, and even those that did.

2260724,5,B000929VA4,"RahXephon is a mecha anime series that is nothing short of amazing. Many Evangelion fans will vehemently state the similarities between the two shows and cry 'clone'. Indeed, both series feature a teenage boy who pilots a mecha to stop an alien invasion of similar mechas. But that's where the similarities end. RX does away with the philosophy and existentialist babble and just presents a deep, engrossing story that's filled with mystery.

Right from the very first episode, questions are going to enter your mind, and as these questions get answered, more pop up, leaving the viewer in a constant state of cluelessness, but always wanting to keep watching the next episode to find the answers. Unlike Eva which eventually becomes a total mess, RX does not go out of its way to confuse you. RX keeps you riveted not by being confusing and making no sense, but by simply providing an exciting story full of intrigue and suspense. The

animation quality is superb. It can pass as an OVA. The character designs (females in particular) are among the best you'll find in TV anime. And the ending, unlike Eva, is actually quite satisfying, and doesn't leave unanswered questions or unresolved plotlines. It ends on a high note, yet still gives the viewer plenty to think about.

I recommend this series to anyone with an open mind, that won't view it with the Eva taint, constantly comparing it to Eva. If you are a fervent fan of Eva, you will probably find it difficult to get it out of your mind. To anyone else over 13, RX is time well spent, and one of the pinacles of anime.",1179878400,5,1577,4.66546762589928
2260725,3,B000929VA4,"First off I am a devoted EVA fan and always will be.  EVA is and probably always will be in a class of its own, to me anyway.  That being said I was hoping Rah-Xephon would be another outstanding Mecha Anime that provoked thought and innovative ideas, but it just doesn't hit the mark.

I purchased the 7 disc thin pack box set.  The box is actually sturdy and has some pretty cool art work.  Still this Anime is one of the more pricy series I have purchased.

From the first episode to the last I could not believe how similar this series was to Evangelion.  The storylines were very similar that is with some slight modifications to scarcely prevent copyright infringements.  So we have similar storylines, that is fine I think it is a great storyline but the actual animation of Rah just didn't hold up.

A sci-fi mecha series should have at the least intense battles between machines.  I don't believe that the Rah-Xephon took damage in battle more than once or twice through 26 episodes.  Not much fun when the Hero mecha Rah continually cuts the enemy in half with a new weapon he just discovered he had.  The Rah has no struggle in battling Dolem after Dolem, to me this is not exciting.  I had a major problem with this issue while watching this series.  And the whole making the Dolems and Rah such wonderful singing devices was a bit much.

The storyline will become increasingly hard to follow.  You have to make sure you are fully cohesive while watching and even then It would difficult to follow.  I still don't understand how all the characters are related to one another.

The main character and pilot of the Rah Ayoto Kamina was not a character I could connect with.  It wasn't just Ayoto, I couldn't seem to connect with a single character in this series.  I could tell they wanted to make this story into a major drama but in doing so I think they sacrificed everything else it could have been.  Even so I found the characters to lack major development and likeability.  Also I didn't think anyone could scream insanely more than Shinji Akari in EVA but Ayoto Kamina blows him out of the water in Rah.

I thought the artwork in Rah was of average quality, it was easy on the eyes but still nothing groundbreaking here.

Ill stop babbling and get to the end.

Where have I seen an ending like this before? The hero becomes one with his Mecha and rebirths the world.

So if you're looking for an expensive & average mecha series pick this up.  If you have seen Evangelion and are a fan do not bother getting this anime, basically a waste of money and time.  Sorry for being so real.",1175904000,10,2599,4.437632135306554

2260727,3,B000929VA4,"I had an unusual reaction to this series: I didn't exactly *like* it, but I couldn't stop watching it.

From a ""mecha design"" standpoint, it's innovative. All the Mu mecha have rounded edges, rather than the traditional blocky giant robot shapes. The characters are more than compelling--indeed, finding out what happened to all the characters is primarily what kept me watching. There are individual moments of immense tragic beauty, such as episode 19, which features some of the most brilliant concepts and sledge-hammer-to-the-chest emotional moments of the series; and incredible sweetness, such as the show's epilogue, which made every viewer in the room go ""Awwwwww"" and smile.

Sadly, the ""big picture"" of the series is never really explained well; the plot gears never really mesh properly. I'm used to enigmatic and hard-to-understand anime (e.g., Boogiepop Phantom), and this was so confusing that I had to flee to Wikipedia mid-series to figure out what was going on. And while I was there, I read the summary of the entire plot, and when I got to the climax and resolution, I just didn't care.

This series is worth watching, but not necessarily worth owning. Unless, of course, you like it. I would recommend viewing at least one or two DVDs before you commit to the entire series.

I also *very* strongly recommend only using the Japanese language track. The English language track significantly exacerbates the show's flaws, and prevents the show's essential sweetness (its most redeeming quality) from coming through.",1164412800,4,1534,5.173387096774194
2260728,5,B000929VA4,"This anime delivers everything Neon Genesis Evangelion failed to.  If you are looking for action, romance, cerebral content, and an ultimately moving series, this anime is for you.  If you are looking for absurdly esoteric symbolism, heaps of angst, and a snobbish fan base, you have stumbled onto the wrong series.

While Rahxephon does have a fair share of symbolism, foreshadowing, and brain teasers, it is NOT needlessly convoluted, unlike Evangelion.  As to comparisons between the two, Rahxephon and Evangelion are similar only so far as they both involve humanoid mechs, a male main character, and an epic story.  Other than that, Rahxephon is its own series.  If you enjoy character-focused action/romance/drama/comedy anime with minimal angst, this series will not disappoint.  Please do note that the focus of the series is actually not on combat for combat's sake.  While this anime has plenty of action, such encounters act merely as a portion of the orchestra that makes up the symphony that is Rahxephon.

Technical Note: This set contains the complete 26 episode long series and (at least mine) does come with the Rahxephon movie, located at the end of the series.

Important Note: If you receive the same set I did, the movie starts after the credits of the 26th episode, the last episode of the series.  A lot of people seem to have accidentally mistaken the movie as the series restarting.  Don't do that!  The movie focuses on explaining certain aspects of the series.  While it does use a lot of footage from the series, it alters it a good deal and adds on it.  Pay close attention to the dialogue in the first five minutes.

2260730,5,B000929VA4,"Rahxephon is a masterpiece. It has one of the smartest and original stories ever written, with characters that are easy to love and hate, depending on their role in the series. To add to that, Rahxephon has a soundtrack that perfectly matches both the mood of every scene, as well as the overall theme of the anime, and since this anime is based off of musical patterns, a good musical score is a must.

But all that wasn't enough for me to give Rahxephon a five. It was actually the final two minutes of the twenty-sixth episode that caused me to give this series a five. While I won't describe it, and therefore spoil it, I'll say that it does everything and then some to fully explain what was actually going on between the two main characters of this series, Ayato and Haruka. To me, it was the perfect ending to a series that had me a bit puzzled until those last minutes, and I actually laughed out loud at the final words that flashed across the screen before it was finally over. So, advance warning, don't turn the final episode off until all the credits have rolled or else you'll miss one of the most important moments in the story.

As for the story, Rahxephon follows a seventeen-year-old boy named Ayato who grows up believing that his small place in Tokyo is all that is left after an apocalypse. Yet this, as he learns quickly, is a lie, and Ayato soon finds himself the key tool in a battle against a race of alien creatures known as the Mu, who appear human in every aspect but their blue blood. Working for a military organization known as Terra, Ayato battles the Mu's Dolem, giant robotic creatures who use sound patterns as weapons, with his own giant robot, the Rahxephon. Along the way, Ayato meets a few friends, as well as experiencing some rather strange occurrences, including an illusionary girl, a few love interests, and a red-haired girl named Quan who seems to know more about Ayato than he does.

Well, that's about the gist of the plot. Rahxephon is actually a difficult anime to explain. I can say that it's somewhat of a love story as well as a tale of apocalypse, with a large cast of characters. But still, I can promise that if ever there was a giant robo anime to come close to the success of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Rahxephon is it. It contains a story as smart as Eva, only a little less confusing. It has excellent animation and a lot of great action. And it has the aforementioned soundtrack, including what may be the best opening credit song to ever grace an anime. Get this if you love giant robo anime, or loved Eva. Also, if you like Studio BONES productions (Fullmetal Alchemist; Wolf's Rain; Eureka Seven), then this is definitely one you'd like to get.",1152057600,8,2706,4.507128309572302

While the characterization was more personable than Evangelion, that's about the only good thing. Evangelion conveyed more urgency, panic and passion than Rah Xephon, and did it better.

The orbital ""Angel"" was a pretty obvious rip-off.  While imitation is supposedly the sincerest form of flattery, it doesn't make the imitator stand out.  I think people like that Rah Xephon resolves better and more neatly than Evangelion, however I don't find it to be a better storyteller though.

It was a decent enough anime, but it's not an epic.  You won't find much intensity and the ending of the series is really rather abrupt and quite a let down after the build up from the rest of the series.",1144886400,2,813,4.764285714285714
2260733,5,B000929VA4,"If you want to know the storyline, read another review.  I am posting my opinions about this series without delving into the plot too much:

First of all, I am a huge fan of Evangelion (except the last two episodes).  Many giant mecha animes are thinly veiled rip-offs of this original story.  At first it seems that Rah Xephon is a more colorful and better animated version of Eva.  After the second episode I changed my mind.

What sets Rah Xephon apart from other animes first and foremost is the superb characterization.  This is one of the greatest casts of characters in anime.

Ayato Kamina is the stereotypical young male hero, but his melancholy soon is replaced with a kind of peace and he finds happiness despite the troubles in the world.  Haruka and the others at TERRA are also well rounded and likeable.  Some of the secondary characters appear constantly throught the series but have little development, though this is hardly a negative point as the cast of primary characters numbers at least 20.

The story is unique and well written.  It does of course bear a striking similarity to Hitchcock's Vertigo and some other classic sci-fi movies and novels.

Sometimes the battle scenes are a little boring, since the Rah Xephon doesn't really move too much.  I suppose that the art is so intricate that the team did not want to spend all of their time and money creating animation cells for it.

Like Evangelion, the ending leaves a lot to be disired, but it does give one food for thought.  Unlike Eva, the last episode is as beautifully animated as the first.  The only other sci-fi animes that comes close to Rah Xephon are Gundam Seed and Evangelion.  Do yourself a favor and buy the whole series.  I bought the first DVD and then had to wait for the others to show up...",1144454400,4,1789,4.6044303797468356
2260734,5,B000929VA4,"First off, I loved Rah and hated Eva, so keep that in mind reading this. ;)

As I added to my Eva review here, Eva did it first, but Rah did it RIGHT.

Other people have said Rah blows you away for visuals, and they're right.  The Last Exile was the only series I've seen that's on par with the beautiful art here.

The beginning's a bit hectic to be sure, but after the mess that was Evangelion, I was willing to sit it out for a few episodes.  Boy am I glad I did!

You won't even notice when Rah works its subtle charm on you, but you'll suddenly realize you're connecting pieces of the story and really getting involved.

Eva NEVER gave me a similar moment, most of that's weak ""what if"" at best.  RahXephon took the entirely different road with their ideas.  If you watch to the end and then think about each and every instance, Rah DOES make sense.  The wierd happenings all are understandable, something Eva didn't seem to bother with at all.

As to why the Mu only sent out Dolems one at a time?  Unlike Eva's Angels which really DIDN'T make sense to be attacking solo, the Mu weren't after conquest.  Their whole motive was to awaken Rah.  This's why they don't outright try to kill Xephon in the first episode.  See?  Like I said, Rah makes sense!

Don't even get me started on character differences.  Night and day, baby.  Rah's populace is heroic and act like actual humans, for the most part.  None of the gloom and doom from Eva.  As a result, you actually give a damn about them.  The underpinning main romance will have ya jumping up and down in your chair screaming ""Just tell him!"", it's that well written.

And the biggest point in favor of RahXephon?  It's resolved.  All the philospies and long episodes go somewhere.  There's no jumbled mess at the end of Rah.  The ending, while ambiguous except for a few characters, is an ending.  An ending a HUMAN would choose if given Rah's choices.  Eva forgot that it was dealing with humans somewhere, instead turning them all into fatalistic robots with a deathwish in the second half.

Eva did it first, but RahXephon did it right.  Here comes the sun, baby.",1143936000,33,2124,4.424870466321243
2260735,3,B000929VA4,"Overall, I would say RahXephon was a nice series. It had a very good soundtrack ranging from J-pop to Wagner, some interesting plot points and characters, and some excellent twists and a few rather deep questions and points of well-done drama, though I don't want to give any spoilers.

On the other hand, it had a lot of very glaring flaws (which is why I gave it three stars). First, and what I found most irritating, was that it simply borrowed too much from Neon Genesis Evangelion. The basic premise and setting are both clearly derived from Eva, as are many of the themes. At times, it was quite jarring.

Additionally, the combination of opera with Mayan mythology also struck me as rather contrived as well as somewhat poorly implimented. Their impression of opera struck me as consisting mainly of stereotypes gleamed from second hand accounts of Wagner's Ring cycle, to be blunt.

Finally, I found a number of aspects rather unrealistic, particularly the dolems (where they supposed to be valkyries as part of the opera motif or something?), which seemed like a rather odd choice of weapon presumably intended to look cool on television. And of course, there's the way they usually attack one at a time despite consistantly failing this way...

In conclusion, I would consider it a good series, but certainly not an excellent one overall. Still, it does have its moments that I think make it worth considering.",1139529600,5,1420,4.855371900826446
2260736,5,B000929VA4,"This series is a complete mind-f**k. More twists and turns than anything I've ever seen, except Akira.

Many characters, cool animations and tightly wound story lines make this an anime for fans of both mecha and anime in general.",1137974400,3,230,4.897435897435898
2260737,5,B000929VA4,"Often enough this series is compared to NGE (Neon Genesis) and is blamed for following in its footsteps. In all honesty I find RahXephon extremely creative, thought provoking and well done. In its own right RahXephon stands out as possibly one of the very best ""mecha"" series to date, in a class and category all to itself!

As a fan of thought provoking animes (preferring seriousness over humor and calm introspective moments for the characters over highly complicated battle sequences), I was deeply disappointed with NGE and many movies in the Gundam line... was it impossible to fuse high-technology robots with an intellectual storyline? Was it impossible to bring great voice acting, great animation and design together in one series?

At first I thought I was asking a lot ... that was until I caught RahXephon on G4TV.

RahXephon's art alone is superb. The series is drawn and animated quite beautifully, almost everything on the screen is highly detailed and appropriately colored. The series comes across as extremely stunning in comparison with other mecha-type shows. In other shows the artists sacrifice detail in order to bring you quick action sequences - RahXephon doesn't focus too much on the action sequences and instead brings you stunning visuals you're sure to remember.

RahXephon features a creative storyline: a world in which music plays a key role in human events. Music literally shapes the world as a whole and when two races collide (Humans and Mulians); music might just be the world's only salvation. Through themes which were heavily researched (as apparent in the Italian musical notation names of the Dolem - enemy Mu fighting units - and through the use of clever poetry to foreshadow events to come), RahXephon's storyline is one of the most engaging storylines in a mecha-type show I've seen.

RahXephon is a story about uncertainty, taking risks, and exploring the nature of reality. And yet for all the major themes present, through the use of downright loveable characters (who are aesthetically pleasing as well as interesting), we see a world ""suffused with sound"" in all of its magnificence.

An anime great. I recommend this series to anyone with any interest in mecha combat mixed with a heavy story! Those with a good grasp on what makes a quality Japanese animation are bound to enjoy RahXephon!",1135209600,16,2344,5.043927648578811
2260738,4,B000929VA4,"To be honest this is one of the best series I've ever seen however

from the begining to the end it's almost same as N.G.E.

2260739,3,B000929VA4,Rahxephon was good value for money as a complete collection.  The series itself did not live up to my expectatitions in terms of action.  However; it did have some interesting love triangles and twists in the plot.,1125532800,4,214,4.756756756756757
2260740,5,B000929VA4,"Hi, I'm an anime fan. I watched Rahxephon: The Complete Collection. It has a great opera like orchestra. Beautiful music if Rahxephon is ready for battle. it combines with music, drama, mecha, and a little comedy. It is a masterpiece anime since Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Princess  Mononoke. It almost similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion.",1124409600,,385,4.923076923076923
2260741,5,B000929VA4,I love this series as much as N.G.E. because RahXephon is almost completley based on it. From begining to end alot of EVA can be seen. Like EVA there are 26 episodes and a motion picture that recaps the series. and the last couple episodes are like a combination of the two endings to Evangelion. I would recomend this to anyone who likes great anime.,1122940800,2,351,4.415384615384616

8056679,5,B000929VA4,"Not a bootleg.

The significantly-reduced price of this one to the other DVD set that Amazon sells concerned me that this was a malignant bootleg.  It may be one, as it opens saying video cassette, on these DVDs.  But it runs just fine and has exactly what it says.

Great series.  Very akin to Neon Genesis Evangelion, but I found the metaphors and symbolism far more palatable and less pretentious in this one.",1445904000,2,412,4.589041095890411

8056683,1,B000929VA4,"I took a chance on Rahxephon despite the flow of opinions stating that it borrows too heavily from Evangelion.  I can understand being inspired and borrowing themes and elements from a successful story.  Hell, all stories are derived somewhat from one another.

In the first 2 episodes I saw the similarities and waited patiently for them to branch off into their own story.  It never happened, and I felt insulted for the creator of Eva with every episode.  The style, the characters, the boys connection to his mech, the angel/Christian overtones, the obligatory cutaways meant to evoke meaning, the music, the strategic differences in the enemies, the clandestine organization, the mother complex, the joining with the mech to form a Godlike creator.  It was gross.

I tried to pretend that this show had its own mind and isn't a poorly crafted knockoff, so I could review its production value as if I had never seen Eva.

The animation is adequate, but doesn't inspire much.  The music is repetitive and a little out of place, but not horrible.  The characters are dull and their psychological state is an open book.  The ideas and revelations only mean something if you decide that they do.  The pacing and narrative are all over the place because they were given 26 episodes and didn't know what to do with all that time.  Even if Eva didn't exist this would still be a very poor product.

I just goes to show you that execution is king.  You can copy a successful format as close as you want, but if you can't execute, gold turns to crap pretty fast.  What a waste of a team of artist's.",1403049600,,1594,4.639285714285714
8056684,5,B000929VA4,"There isn't really anything i didn't like about it. Though i could see it easily being 50 episodes to better explore some of the show's themes, and perhaps more character development. Really though a ""must watch"" series.",1394323200,,220,4.972972972972973

8056686,3,B000929VA4,"This is the weirdest anime I have probably ever seen!  The thing that bothered me about the show most was how it seemed the episodes didn't connect to each other.  They would end and the next one would start off at a completely different place.  I liked the animation but this show was just clustered with too many characters and ambitions that it wasn't able to carry out by the end.  Still, it was entertaining and kept me wanting more.  If you like Evangelion I would say watch this.  It is sort of like it.  A lot of people are making comparisons.  There are similarities but I wouldn't call this a rip off.",1385078400,,611,4.345132743362832
