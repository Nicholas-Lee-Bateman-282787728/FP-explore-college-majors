2688174,5,B000KD0R32,"This is an amazing box set, with a ton of content and extras. That said the steep price means it will probably be limited to the most loyal of Joe fans. So while its easy a five star package for the Joephile, due to the price its probably a 3 or 4 to those on the fence.

If you are willing to take the plung though what you get is every GI Joe episode, two comics, all the safety messages, concept art, a dog tag USB drive and a bit more. And all of that is a sweet little foot locker like case. Considering the amount of content you get the price isn't really that bad. But be sure you are ready to try to recapture the nostalgia from your youth before you buy this. What I have discovered is my memory of watching GI Joe before school each morning is best kept as a memory. I now find the show itself rather hard to watch because it just can't live up to my memory of it. That is nothing to do with the product but something to keep in mind.

So for the ultimate Joe fan this is the ultimate box set, you won't be sorry. For those on the fence spend some times and though because this certainly shouldn't be an impulse buy. But at least you feel you get your monies worth with this one.",1260835200,2,1189,3.991596638655462
2688175,4,B000KD0R32,"I too brought this set when it was an exclusive and I would have to agree with the other reviews that the episodes and bonuses are very nice and it's finally great to have all the episodes in one complete set. My gripe is that the packaging could have been a whole lot better for the over 145 dollar price tag. My green box started to get green faded marks only after a week and I had to hand laminate the box to keep it in good condition. Also the disc artwork is great but the booklets they come in are very flimsy. The covers are cardboard and I also had to hand laminate them myself to keep it sturdy and they look much better with that gloss feel. Shout Factory would have been better off making the dvd booklets inside vinyl or some other sturdy material so they don't age so fast. Also inside the booklets the trays that hold the dvds are thinly glued together and they some times seperate. And finally the collectible booklet is rather flimsy also, for the price I just expected the packaging to be top notch and that is the most disappointing thing, collector's items should be sturdy and well made. I felt if this set was 99 dollars to 115 dollars that would be more reasonable, but you do get a lot content wise and that's the saving grace.",1258675200,6,1251,4.282700421940929
2688176,5,B000KD0R32,"As for the quality of the GI JOE cartoon, SHOUT, the picture quality - very sharp on an HD TV and Blu-ray player, pitch-perfect sound; you look beyond minor blemishes like dust particles, etc.  It's just wonderful to have these all on DVD finally.

GI JOE side note (for completists); for the complete set, the 17 discs have the same characters as the individual release... however, the complete set discs have the original hand-drawn character PROFILE pictures, whereas the individual set releases have the cartoon character images on the discs. And, the individually released introduction DVD ""The M.A.S.S. Device"" has three figher jets with the red white and blue jetstreams as the picture disc, so they're all quite different. Also, interesting to point out, there's an empty tray slot, an ""18th"" disc spot for the 1987 GI JOE movie that does not come with the set, hopefully it's released at a later date. Not sure why the Transformers movie wasn't included in the complete TF set. Too bad... or had an empty ""17th"" disc spot.",1257552000,6,1031,4.885714285714286
2688177,5,B000KD0R32,"This is actually a pretty bad ass box set.  The original G.I. Joe cartoon has all the makings of classic 80s cartoons; insane and unreal action, real hand drawn animation, cheesy dialogue and, of course, lessons to be learned all around.

QUALITY:
Who cares.  It's not the greatest, but did you really expect any better?  It was a weekly show, produced at a minimal budget, there is only so much that can be done.  Maybe I'll complain when it makes it's way to blu-ray but, for now, it's fine by me.

BONUS FEATURES (AND FREEBIES):
All the Public Service Announcements, Fan material, the original toy fair from 1963, archival toy commercials, featurettes, collectible booklet, some pretty badass rub on tattoos and a 1 GB dog tag flash drive with 2 G.I. Joe comic books contained.

PACKAGING:
The packaging is amazing.  It comes encased in a pretty solid camo green box with latch and embossed window showing the G.I. Joe logo.  Open it up and there is a fascimile in plastic of a military computer.  Lift it up and you have all the goods.  The one issue right off the bat is that the lid inside the case to get to all the items is fairly heavy as the underside has a pocket with all 17 DVDs in 2 books.  This lid doesn't stay up on it's own so you have to hold it in order to get to the DVDs, booklet or anything else.  A small issue but annoying nonetheless.

The discs are well done with full color and exclusive artwork of individual characters on each one.  There is an empty slot at the end of the collection for the 1988 movie.  Don't fret because it is supposed to be empty, there are still 17 discs as promised.  Including the movie would have been a nice touch and it's a shame that they didn't (especially since it's out of print) but it's technically not what you are buying here.  The book included walks you through each disc and each character.

OVERALL:
95 episodes of awesome and gnarly 80s cartoon action (yes, I just said gnarly).  The 17 discs are put together incredibly well and the box, as a whole, is very well made.  The disappointments (none self sustaining lid, somewhat poor quality and lack of movie inclusion) aren't enough to bring down this incredible set.  Most sets usually aren't worth the inflated price tag, but this one, at a mere $145 is well worth the purchase.  A buck and a half per episode plus all the bonuses?  You coudln't beat that price on iTunes.",1255910400,42,2395,4.465437788018433
2688178,5,B000KD0R32,"As a youngster, some of my fondest memories were coming home after school, sitting on the couch and watching G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero on afternoon television.  On a regular basis I would run home from the bus stop, just wondering to myself which episode was going to be on today.  Because of these fantastic cartoons by Sunbow, the G.I. Joe and COBRA characters got a new life and a new energy, and seeing them come to life on the television screen filled my impressionable 10-year old mind with joy.

Of course, as with anything we loved as a child, sometimes the rose colored glasses make the cartoon look a little better twenty-five years ago than it does today...there are certain parts of the Sunbow cartoon era that do make me chuckle, now that I'm in my 30's, but that's no reason to turn your back on a piece of animation history.

Back in those days you couldn't tell an animated story quite as maturely as you can today.  Stuff like Batman: The Animated Series, The Simpsons, or even Clone Wars wasn't something cartoon writers or producers could even think about, so the folks behind the scenes at the production company had to figure out how they could tell a story about soldiers fighting terrorists without death or without bullets.  The end result was an animated adventure that seemed more super hero than military and was, of course, quite campy for a military action/adventure.  But if you take a closer look you can see, even amongst the conveniently timed parachutes and odd colored lasers, that this was actually a smartly written show, especially geared towards the under-10 crowd.

Beyond that, though, there's a heaping helping of nostalgia, a nice taste of simpler times where good and evil were a lot more clearly defined.  Where you could sit down and watch your action figures jump around on the TV screen for 22 minutes without looking for deeper meaning aside from wondering what rhymes Roadblock was going to come up with, or how Cobra Commander could possibly screw things up worse than he had the previous episode.  The cartoon was ludicrous, but it was fantastically ludicrous, and it gave birth to a whole generation of G.I. Joe fans who identify with the characters born on screen.

The best thing is, this set has EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.  Every last ""Cobra, RETREAT!!!"" uttered by Cobra Commander.  Every last ""Yo, Joe!"" by Duke or Gung Ho.  Every octive of that catchy theme song that folks know so well, and every ""Knowing is Half the Battle!"" spoken by each character.  Two full seasons, a wealth of 5-parters, and more special features than you can shake a stick at, this boxed set has about everything you could look for in a Sunbow Series collection.  If you want a rundown of exactly what this series has to offer, I've reviewed it on my website as well: [...].

While G.I. Joe: The Movie from 1987 is noticeably absent, there is even a slot for it amongst the jewel cases, and even without that dubious end to the Sunbow era, this is one full and complete collection of animated goodness from the 80's.

Whether your a child of the 80's trying to relive your youth, an adult who just saw The Rise of Cobra, and want to explore G.I. Joe's history, or most importantly, a parent who wants some wholesome and enjoyable entertainment for your new young Joe fan, this set is a can't miss proposition.  The best, the worst, and everything in between, whatever you want to know about the G.I. Joe cartoon you can find in these discs.  I cannot recommend it enough!",1255651200,25,3506,4.660714285714286
2688179,4,B000KD0R32,"I got this set back then as an exclusive purchase at SDCC. I'm amazed by the details and  extensive bonus features. Most of all, the complete series of GI JOE are collected in one box. Great bonus features,especially men & women of action. Really explains the development and production of this animated series. This has been my kids' Saturday morning TV programing lately.
We got the previous shoddy none-complete Rhino release, those bonus features aren't really relevant to the original animated series. Poor picture quality. But this new set is awesome! My recommendation: BIG THUMBS UP. Glad that I got it early at SDCC because I saw the set on other sites for much higher price.",1255564800,10,684,4.896551724137931
2688180,2,B000KD0R32,"While no where near as flawed as their Transformers DVDs, Rhino's DVDs of G.I. Joe were not without their problems. Incorrect intros, uncorrected footage, unwarranted digital ""corrections"", and even censorship appeared on the four sets Rhino released before loosing the Sunbow license. When Shout! Factory announced their complete sets for both shows, the hope was that G.I. Joe would arrive on DVD complete and as broadcast. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. For the most part, the episodes that were released by Rhino earlier this decade are the same on this set as they were on the Rhino releases (though the intros have fixed for the first half of Season 1, thankfully).

What this means is that, among others, the following errors return:

-Two Timbers near the beginning of the fourth part of The MASS Device, ""Duel in the Devil's Cauldron""
-The wrong text on Cobra Commander's card about the Fatal Fluffies in Part 1 of The Pyramid of Darkness
-A dizzying number of missed re-takes in the second part of The Pyramid of Darkness, but a digital edit to ""fix"" a shot where some of the USS Flagg's sailors ""blink"" on and offscreen (even though this error was not fixed in the aired episode)
-Some shots of Lt. Claymore in ""The Traitor"" Part 2 where the African-American Cobra is colored as a caucasian male
-The censorship of ""There's No Place Like Springfield"" Part 2 when Althaea points a bazooka at Shipwreck and calls him a ""drip""
-Images of (very crudely illustrated) nude women that were cropped out of ""Glamour Girls"" before airing

And the following errors are introduced (again, this isn't a complete list):

-The final part of The MASS Device miniseries featured a slightly longer version of the MASS end credits when it aired. While the audio appears intact here, the credits are of the normal, shorter version. The video is not slowed down, so you get black space for the last 8 seconds or so of the theme.
-Only two of the writers of ""Grey Hairs and Growing Pains"" receive credit for their work.
-Duke appears as a background character during the final act of ""The Most Dangerous Thing in the World"" when he was systematically (and, truth be told, creatively) removed from the episode before airing so as to not create a massive plot hole
-In ""In the Presence of Mine Enemies"" a shot of Raven (the Native American Strato-Viper featured in the episode) features a digital edit to ""correct"" an instance where she was given the skin color of a caucasian (while leaving alone a couple of long shots).
-In ""Into Your Tent I Will Silently Creep"", Cross County's line, "".....but I know there's a bunch of music critics!"" is excised from the cafeteria scene. This edit was shown off in Rhino's Season 2, Part 1 set in the Special Features section.

The special features are equally lacking. First and foremost, seven of the infamous PSAs are not present on this set. Secondly, the presence of Larry Hama in many of the features (including one focused on him) seems a bit excessive, especially since Hama had minimal interaction with the Sunbow writing staff (and, according to an online interview with Buzz Dixon, who was not interviewed for this set, there was some antipathy between the Joe writers and Hama). Also annoying is how the comics included on the dog-tag memory stick play off the Snake Eyes vs. Storm Shadow conflict that appeared only in the comics-the cartoon featured Storm Shadow in an ongoing battle with SPIRIT. However, these annoyances are partially offset by the sublime cast reunion and the large number of toy commercials (the comic commercials, like all direct references to Marvel Comics, have been omitted from this set).

However, it is the meat of this DVD set, the episodes, where it ultimately fails. In using the 35mm negatives on these Sunbow sets, Hasbro and their home video partners have opened a Pandora's Box of problems. Sure, the footage culled from the negatives looks great (even though Rhino's telecine transfers were decidedly subpar), but let's face facts: G.I. Joe, The Transformers, and all the other Sunbow shows were edited on video. While this would not normally be an unsurpassable hurdle, the film elements for the re-takes have not shown themselves, and may be lost. Therefore, it's prudent to concentrate on cleaning up and preserving the 1"" broadcast masters. Sure, this will not address the censorship issues (all three of them), but it will eliminate the bulk of the problems with this DVD set.",1254700800,39,4462,4.879947229551451

Now, while the writing isn't as good as Larry Hama's GI Joe comics from the same period (Hama - who also wrote all the toy names and file cards and - took a more realistic military approach to the characters and universe, with the added mystique of a long-arching Ninja clan storyline thrown in for good measure, while the cartoons and movie took a more sci-fi approach to the universe, including rather fantasy-oriented origins for Cobra in Cobra-La), but that does not detract from the series overall.

It says it comes with a thumbdrive, but can't seem to find mine in it.",1283904000,,364,4.214285714285714
2688210,4,B000KD0R32,"I can't believe they call this the complete series cuz like The Transformers there were some more episodes after the movie. That is why I bought this cuz I thought this set would include those episodes so I could finally see the sequel to the movie. But no this set stops at the movie. If your a real fan like me you know this series continued after the movie. Yeah General Hawk in his new outfit, the new G.I.Joe base, a new Battle Andriod Trooper commander named Overkill, & Ninja Force with Snake-Eyes, Storm Shadow, & Scarlet. Other than that i like this set.",1282608000,3,563,4.423076923076923
2688211,4,B000KD0R32,Great set it brings back memories of coming home after school as a kid and watching G.I. Joe with other great cartoons of that time. My only complaint is the case is a little hard to keep open and easy to tear which I found out very quick. Other then that it was great viewing!,1279411200,,277,4.054545454545455
2688212,5,B000KD0R32,"As you read all the many positive reviews here, you'll see why I chose this item as my first Amazon review, it deserves it! This set is simply fantastic (AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!). This review really goes out to the producers of the set, Shout! Factory. You can instantly tell that this set was manufactured with the utmost care and detail for the fans and I'm not talking about just the fancy packaging. I'm talking about the video quality/clarity, the sharp/clear sound, the way its all organized/presented and all the wonderful extras included, which have some really touching moments, especially seeing the ensemble of voice talents together and seeing how they genuinely loved and miss working on the series. You truly get an understanding for why the GI Joe animated series has endured as long as it has with us BIG kids (and hopefully our generation of kids, because Rise of Cobra is s&*t!) I just hope that if you're on the fence (like I was) with purchasing it, you just go for it, because the guys at Shout! who put this together deserve the recognition and praise for compiling such a wonderful set for all us fans of JOE!",1270857600,8,1131,4.66
2688213,5,B000KD0R32,"As good as I remember. Now, my kids can watch it. For some reason my 4-yr old daughter seems to enjoy it more than me now, and she especially likes the opening and closing music. Got it when amazon had a sale for 93 dollars, which is about a dollar an episode. Great value! I wish I didn't donate all of my vintage figures (and I had a gigantic collection). Oh well.",1268870400,,366,4.097222222222222
2688214,5,B000KD0R32,"DISCLOSURE: While I am interested in purchasing this, and will more than likely do so, despite the flaws listed by others, I DO NOT currently own this at this time.

Now that that's out of the way, let me get to why I am on here. I have seen two big, in-depth reviews of this product and they have been more helpful and insightful than anyone can imagine. In fact, it should be mine and everyone else's wish that more people write reviews like these so that others know just exactly what they are getting when they purchase said product.

Yes, packaging is very important when making a big purchase. Would you buy this if it was made out of cardstock, or regular untreated cardboard, or manilla folders?

And yes, the quality of print transfers definitely matter. If you are spending the time to make something this big, do it right. Although, I am a fan of tv to dvds being made as they aired, political incorrectness, flaws and all. Does something as trivial as two seconds of credits really matter, as someone asked? YES! In terms of music and video, especially animation, two seconds is a lot. I have refused to buy official LP to CD releases because of such known omissions. And I would do the same for dvds. And censorship? You betcha! Why can't things be released as they were made, language, images, and all. Popeye The Sailor, Vol. One has disclaimers, so should Johnny Quest (1964) (Hint, hint!)

And for the people that get on here and make rude comments about said reviewers, take a long look at yourself before coming on here to try to insult people who write heartfelt reviews of products. Without them we would be a nation of pansies, too scared to buy anything or we would have a s-ton of less than stellar products clogging up our houses.",1267488000,,1755,4.526813880126183
2688215,4,B000KD0R32,"Good points for this product: all the Sunbow episodes (minus the movie) collected, wonderful extras and great re-use of the original box art.

Could be better: the disc holders are of a hard, unbendable clear plastic, with a unpractical disc connector design. In other words: it's not possible to remove the disc from the disc holder without doing some damage to the disc holder, if you don't want to bend the disc too much.",1266796800,3,424,4.72972972972973
2688216,5,B000KD0R32,"G. I. Joe the complete series is a must have for fans. This G I Joe set contains all 95 episodes of the Sunbow/Marvel Productions series! This a great set! The animation is really good. I also like the characters like Duke,Flint, Scarlett, Lady Jaye, Snakeyes, Spirit, Quick Kick, Stalker, Breaker, General Hawk, and the rest of the G I Joe team. Highly Recommended for fans of the 1980s G. I. Joe animated series! The Box set is a must have!",1266624000,2,442,4.469135802469136
2688217,5,B000KD0R32,"I didn't buy the Rhino release years ago so this collector's set was definitely on my short list.  The footlocker is high quality as are the discs and extras.  Since I already have Seasons 1.1-1.3 I've started watching the second season and I'm lovin' it.  The masters for G.I. Joe have held up better than the Transformers and it shows.

I don't have any complaints except that it lacks the 1987 movie.  Shout Factory plans to release it later this year from what I've read.  Anyone who grew on '80s cartoons should definitely buy this.  You'll have fun watching the series again and it'll keep you young at heart :-).",1266451200,2,619,4.572727272727272
2688218,5,B000KD0R32,"Picture and sound quality, along with disc art, are all great! The series is also great (and now comes COMPLETE and complete with the original opening sequence)and it's nice to see GI Joe's classic adventures again (with COMMERCIAL  BUMPERS in tact!).

That being said, this series comes complete with bonus features such as printable scripts, pre-loaded silent comics, and interviews with the cast and creators. In speaking of those bonus features, to settle an ongoing debate, 27 of those nostalgiac PSAs that we youngins grew up on. The grand total of original PSAs runs 35 and I believe that one or two of them on ""The Movie"" (animated movie) DVD aren't included on these volumes, adding two more to the growing collection. The others are probably floating around online some place. But wait; only 27 of 35 PSAs??? When the entire series is finally complete with 95 episodes and in great color on most episodes (save for some rumored scratches on random eps.) and crisp-perfect sound , loaded with beautifully crafted bonus features? For shame, Shout Factory! I deduct all of one/twentieth of a star at most. Other than that, the great qualities obviously outnumber the minorly inconvenient (especially for the whopping $93.00 price tag-which, if you do the math, is less than a dollar an episode and complete with bonus features).

So,I'm very grad can see all episodes with this box set.
However, I cannot grasp contents because English hearing is not so
proud unless English subtitles are displayed. Because I buy that one
if entering subtitles appears, I want to release entering subtitles
by all means.

2688220,5,B000KD0R32,"I couldn't believe when I learned that the entire GI Joe collection was going to be re-released.  I used to look at this show when I was a kid and it just brought home a lot of memories from child hood and all of the cool shows that used to come on TV.  I miss shows like this and it is a shame that it is taking some production companies forever to release these great shows.

I am a Lady J and Flint fan.  What can I say, I'm a romantic.

Unlike today's cartoons, the one from the past don't focus on character development.  I think it was because there were so many main characters at one time, that trying to give them their spotlight would take forever.  It still would have been great to see that kind of development.

Still have part of the second season to view, but I am loving every minute of it.",1263513600,,806,4.089171974522293
2688221,5,B000KD0R32,"It is about time. This was one of the greatest shows for ALL childern to watch back when I was a kid. The toys were awesome and you knew your buddies had some so you would get together and play for hours with Duke, Snake Eyes, Flint, Scralett and so on. Bazooka and Rock & Roll were two of my favorites. The shows had the same plot. Cobra would come up with a scheme and G I Joe would kick their butts. Good vs evil and the good guys would win. G I Joe The Movie 1987 was a jewel in the crown of achievements. It ended the series well and left you knowing the world was safe once again. And to this day I still use the tag line ""knowing is half the battle"". It left an impression on my life and it grew a generation of childern into believing there is some good out there. Thank God for the guys and gals who put this to DVD. You are the best.
