8513602,4,B007ATHNT0,"`Ghostlight `is a film about Martha Graham. It is well done and brilliantly acted by Richard Move as Martha.  There were so many aspects to this creative individual. One of the most touching is the reenactment of Helen Keller's visit to her studio, where she was led around to touch and be touched by the dancers. We can see the beauty and joy of dance itself.
The film is 80 minutes long. There are several extras. The film of Martha performing one of her most famous dances, Lamentationis included.  There is a 27 minute interview with the director and actor recalling their meetings and influences of Martha Graham. A theatrical trailer is also included.

One of the few irritations, but it definitely hinders the enjoyment is the poor and at times, fuzzy sound quality. There were points when the actors were talking so softly I could not tell what they were saying and there are no captions included.

Lovers of dance, the theater and Martha Graham would enjoy this performance.",1348617600,2,983,4.764705882352941
