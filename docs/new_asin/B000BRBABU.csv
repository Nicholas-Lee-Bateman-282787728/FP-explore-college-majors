8091481,5,B000BRBABU,I liked the most the illustrations on the cover and that the price was reasonable. I have no complaints.,1523664000,,104,4.526315789473684
8091482,5,B000BRBABU,The stars still shine. Thinks to biography. And to find the good old movies once remembered. And who did them. Think you.,1453161600,,121,4.545454545454546
8091483,4,B000BRBABU,Low budget set of Hollywood actresses. MOSTLY film clips of their movies. The Julie Andrew's bio is well made. Hit and miss productions.,1441411200,,136,4.956521739130435
8091484,2,B000BRBABU,"This DVD set on the Ladies, as well as the companion set on Leading  Men, are done exactly the same, on the cheap.  Using public domain footage from movie trailers, old movies and tv shows and some ameatur footage taken of the more recent stars, the quality of this set is poor.  This is basically a DVD release of a VHS series of the 1990s called ""Hollywood Remembers,"" and using the exact same footage.  Photos, when used in this documentary, are filmed out of books or magazines...very poor quality all around. DO NOT expect A&E type Bios here.",1156291200,21,547,4.551020408163265
8091485,1,B000BRBABU,"This is the singularly most boring, uninspired, cheaply produced mess I have ever seen. It is nothing but badly edited clips from poor quality trailers with an insipid narration. Do not waste your time and money.",1137715200,28,212,4.916666666666667
