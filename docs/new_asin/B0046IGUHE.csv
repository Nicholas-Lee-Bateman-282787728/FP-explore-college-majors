The next generation needs to see it, because some of entertainment isn't that good. TinTin is great for any age. It feels good to be fascinated with mysteries. Plus, this is a feel-good classic adventure.",1319760000,,324,4.603448275862069
8489625,5,B0046IGUHE,"Mystery Of Shark Lake (The Adventures Of TinTin) (Remastered Version) is a movie that brings back lots of childhood memories. I love Tintin, Milou and the one and only Captain Captain Haddock. We also get to see the antics of the stupid duo of Dupont and Dupond. The animation is just as I remembered it. Great storyline and well-developed characters. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.",1304640000,,383,5.0
