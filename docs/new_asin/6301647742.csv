346753,5,6301647742,"Recorded in the summer of 1988 at Anderson Fair, Houston's modest yet legendary venue for singer-songwriters, this concert video has an intimate aura about it, yet it leaves a grand impression.  The spare musical  accompaniment , consisting of Nanci's guitar and the incomparable James  Hooker's keyboards, only serves to highlight the richness of Ms. Griffith's  wonderful voice.  (Watch this concert video, and you may well decide that  most of Nanci's studio recordings are overproduced.)  Backup singers Denice  Franke and Doug Hudson add lovely, but unobtrusive backup vocals on some of  the songs.
Most of the songs on the video were composed by Ms. Griffith,  but the two covers included, ""Deadwood, South Dakota,"" by  ex-husband Eric Taylor, and ""From a Distance,"" by Julie Gold, do  nothing to diminish the magic of the evening.  (I love Bette Midler and her  booming, lusty voice, but doggone it, I think it borders on a crime against  nature that most folks associate the song with Bette's later recording, and  not with Nanci's magical treatment.  I mean, c'mon.)
The video includes  two songs not included on the CD: a traditional cowboy number, playfully  sung without musical accompaniment; and the touching, wistful ""There's  a Light Beyond These Woods, Mary Margaret.""
In a fair and just  world, Nanci Griffith would be a household name, and Madonna would be  waiting tables.  At least we have this video to show that artistry will  often triumph over marketing, at least in our hearts.",958348800,15,1503,5.115702479338843
7814130,2,6301647742,"Probably one of the worst recordings in history -- the songs can be heard alright -- But the baby-girl banter is so soft you need to crank it up beyond belief, not that it's worth the effort. Live can be magical, it can also be indulgent beyond belief. Ironically, one of the lyrics notes than she needs more than a whisper, 'nuff said, so do we...",1505433600,,348,4.287878787878788
7814132,5,6301647742,"Got the cassette in 1989 and played it to death. I guess nostalgia prompted me to get the digital version. Her ""From a Distance"" blows Bette Midler out of the water.",1493251200,,165,4.354838709677419
