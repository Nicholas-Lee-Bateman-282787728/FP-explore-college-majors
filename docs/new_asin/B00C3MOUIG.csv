5690301,5,B00C3MOUIG,"Once again, the Race provides us with entertaining teams and exciting places most of us will never see in a life time.... and even if we do- we won't be performing the Road Blocks and Detours like these teams do.",1373932800,,212,4.325
5690302,5,B00C3MOUIG,This is the best program on TV. Every Season just get better and better. On my travels I love seeing the same places the racers have been.,1373587200,,138,4.148148148148148
5690303,5,B00C3MOUIG,"All seasons of the Amazing Race are good, but this one stands out as one of the best because of the casting on this season. Such a variety of contrasts between all teams racing and somehow it all works and works well",1372550400,,216,4.166666666666667
5690304,5,B00C3MOUIG,"I like this season, in fact I love all seasons of The Amazing Race, except for the Season with the families.",1370476800,,108,4.190476190476191
5690305,5,B00C3MOUIG,"WOW!!!! How I miss seeing the show!!  Brought back alot of fond memories. If your're a fan of the show, buy every single copy of The Amazing Race!!!  I only wonder why cbs.com isn't selling the DVD's on their website?????",1370390400,,221,4.5
5690306,5,B00C3MOUIG,"I have been pleasantly pleased by this DVD set. The DVDs played well and were safely shipped within the U.S.

This is a pretty exciting season although any fan can easily predict the winner just after the first few episodes. The tasks were not real easy compared to the recent seasons and this season travelled to quite a few off beaten paths. Overall, highly recommended!

By the way, the sound and color are much better than the earlier seasons released on DVDs.",1368835200,,464,4.646341463414634
5690307,5,B00C3MOUIG,"This was one of the better seasons of The Amazing Race.  The contestants were more diverse than usual and it seemed they went to more interesting locales.  It's funny how some seasons The Amazing Race seems to be a snake pit of vipers out to do one another in but in other seasons everyone gets along fine and solid friendships form.  David, the coal miner, and Mary from Kentucky were the stars of this season. You could see from leg to leg Mary blossom as the world opened up to her.  I also loved the two Korean brothers, Erwin and Godwin.  The producers should choose more ordinary people and not so many Hollywood types and please - enough with the blond teams!  I missed this season when it was aired so it was fun to watch it now one leg after the other.  Great season.",1368489600,3,776,4.310344827586207
5690308,1,B00C3MOUIG,we have a deaf member in our family and we are very disappointed that the new TAR sets do not have closed captions like the other TAR sets do. Please add closed captions to subsequent releases or we will not buy them.,1368057600,2,217,4.190476190476191
5690309,5,B00C3MOUIG,I was an early fan of the series and stopped watching with season 9 as it aired.  I stopped too soon as this season was one of the series' best and also had great teams in the end and one of the greatest teams to win.,1367971200,,217,3.717391304347826
5690310,1,B00C3MOUIG,"In Past MoD does shows Closed Captioned on season 2-6,8-9 so now on 10 and 11 don't have it?! Are you Freaking Kidding?!!",1367971200,2,121,4.304347826086956
8577138,5,B00C3MOUIG,"I started watching Amazing Race well after it began so I'm acquiring past seasons as the opportunity presents.  It's great to binge watch a season that is new to me over several days.  I wish it had bonus features like elimination station, but overall Season 10 was highly entertaining.",1483142400,,286,4.816326530612245
8577139,5,B00C3MOUIG,Adding another season to my collection of the best reality series that's still going strong today.,1466380800,,98,5.1875
8577140,5,B00C3MOUIG,because I will see them win for the team host of Phil Keoghan and they like to run and during the places,1397692800,,104,3.772727272727273
8577141,2,B00C3MOUIG,"The teams on this season are weak------ physically and in their character! I love watching this show because it is interesting to watch the integrity---- or lack of it in this case of the participants. What better way to measure one's integrity than to watch how they treat their significant other as well as their competitors.
In this season their are two ""best friends and single moms ""Lyn and Karlyn"". Karlyn seems to have some , well, its hard not to notice, umm, race issues with the other teams. She comes off as a very unhappy woman and drags the show down. I am surprised that they weren't eliminated earlier, however two other teams actually supported them despite the fact that Karlyn openly dissed everyone! Karlyn should be ashamed at the poor example she set for her kids. Lyn came across as a decent person.
The team of Sarah and Peter was tragic---- the boyfriend Peter denigrated his girlfriend and made the journey hard on her----- despite her prosthetic leg! He was mean and self-centered.
The biggest surprise was the inclusion of a devout Muslim pair who came across as creepy. They were eliminated early, thankfully.
Overall, the most ""real"" personalities were the two former beauty pageant contestants who were freindly and respectful to all, but played their own game. Yet people were critical of them as untrustworthy. Its a game! Other teams formed a ""six pack"" which completely fell apart when they realized no one really was on board with the idea!
Overall, a good season to watch, but the teams physically were weak.",1392854400,2,1544,4.830188679245283
8577142,1,B00C3MOUIG,"This was a great season and we would have enjoyed it much more had the disks not continually gotten stuck or skipped major events. Amazon does not allow returns after one month. Unfortunately, we bought several seasons and didn't discover the problem until it was too late to exchange. The cost is a lot for something that didn't even work the first time we watched it.",1389225600,,369,4.606060606060606
8577143,1,B00C3MOUIG,"I gave this a one star rating because the quality of the DVDs for this set were unbelievably bad not for the show itself. When I initially ordered this set, I had ordered it along with Seasons 6, 8, 9 and 11 - seasons 6, 8 and 9 were in perfect condition but this set as well as season 11 arrived with discs 1 and 2 badly scratched in both sets. So Amazon sent me a replacement for both sets and were nice enough to not have me ship the defective ones back. However, once again, discs 1 and 2 in both sets were badly scratched. Again, Amazon sent me another replacement for both sets but yet again both sets arrived with the same result - discs 1 and 2 badly scratched in both sets. After all this, Amazon refunded me my money for both sets which is great and all but I really wanted to add Seasons 10 and 11 to my collection.

What bothers me most with this is the fact that discs 1 and 2 arrived badly scratched every single time but yet the other seasons of Amazing Race I have purchased from Amazon were in perfect condition. Learn from my mistake, do not buy this set or season 11!",1383609600,2,1086,4.098591549295775
8577144,5,B00C3MOUIG,"Amazing Race has been exciting since season 1. There are twists and turns to every season, but all allow the viewer to explore the world from home.",1381708800,,147,4.481481481481482

8577147,5,B00C3MOUIG,"Awesome as always, any season you watch is enjoyable.  I just can't find seasons 12-13-15-and 16. On DVD or steaming video. Lets hope amazon solves that problem.",1374969600,,161,4.962962962962963
