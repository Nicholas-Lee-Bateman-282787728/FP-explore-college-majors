1238326,3,B00000JQSP,"If you know Les caprices de Marianne, the story is quite similar. But there is a lot of sad love stories in Hitchcock movies. The poor Carl Brisson, yet ""cocu"" in The Ring (1927) is cocu again here, in  Polpero, 1929. In his last silent movie, Hitch depictes the mindstorm of  Malcolm Keen: he loves his best friend wife, want to live with her, but he  believes in friendship and feels himself miserable. The movie is very  atmospheric, a bit long and slow. A kind of mini-tragedy. This movie is  very interesting and, if not a chef-d'oeuvre, a film each Hitcock fan have  to watch. Images are grey and sound is very poor... but a fan is a fan!",960681600,,644,4.369747899159663
1238327,3,B00000JQSP,"What a great pleasure to watch old silent movies. The Hitchcock collection 1 provides you very good movies: The Manxman takes place in Polpero, England, and is a bit slow, but an injoyable and - as always with Hitch-  sad love story. The Ring is a model for Raging Bull (Scorcese)and quite  interesting, because Hitch plays with the polysemie of the word: sad love  story, but great film.  The more interesting film is perhaps BLACKMAIL:  first english talking movie ever! And, years before the best Hitch american  movies, watch the scene, after the murder, where the heroine listen a woman  speaking about knive... knive...Knive. Of course, you have a boring movie  (The skin game) but the pack worth his price. Images are OK and the sound  is quite good for such old movies.",960681600,6,777,4.7819548872180455
7913421,4,B00000JQSP,"The Manxman (Alfred Hitchcock, 1929)

I watched three Alfred Hitchcock movies I'd never seen before this week. One of them is considered among his best films; The Lady Vanishes appears on over half the critical thousand-best lists I have collected over the years. The other two, Young and Innocent and The Manxman, appear on none. These would seem to be considered relatively minor films as far as Hitchcock's output is concerned. So it may be somewhat sacrilegious for me to say this, but I liked The Manxman, Hitchcock's final silent film, just as much as The Lady Vanishes.

Based on a novel by Hall Caine (which had already been adapted into a film in 1917 by George Loane Tucker; while by the standards of the time it was an almost unimaginably lavish production, the few voters on IMDB who've seen it as I write this are largely unimpressed), The Manxman is the classic love triangle story. Kate Creegan (the delicious Andry Onna, who would later appear in Hitchcock's Blackmail) is the daughter of the innkeeper on the Isle of Man, which lies between Wales and Ireland. Two childhood friends are both infatuated with her; fisherman Peter (Carl Brisson, returning from Hitch's The Ring) is below her station, but a good, solid man who truly loves her; she's altogether fond of him, but her father isn't happy with the match. He sails off to sea to make his fortune, leaving Kate in the capable hands of Philip (Malcolm Keen, also a Hitch veteran; he'd appeared in The Lodger), an aspiring Deemster (island judge) who is as much above her station as Peter is below it; in this case, it's his parents who don't approve of the match. For, yes, Philip is just as much in love with Kate as is Peter.

It's wonderful stuff indeed, with the classic love-triangle plot being used for all sorts of ethical dilemmas, acts of nobility, and the like. I feel like I should probably be more concerned by the fact that Onna's character is more a vehicle for these dilemmas and acts than a character in her own right, but I wasn't, and I've been mulling it over for a couple of weeks and honestly I still can't. I found this little drama (""little"" in the sense of ""intimate"" more than ""minor"") charming, and the blush hasn't faded as it's stayed in my memory. A neglected Hitchfilm whose current presence on Netflix Instant (at least as of this writing) should be celebrated. ****",1364169600,,2370,4.6650717703349285

7913423,3,B00000JQSP,"This film has been restored by Lionsgate and looks very good.  I used to read about The Manxman and other early films by Hitchcock, but there was not ability to see them.  Most were assumed lost or unavailable.  This is a real find!  The Manxman is a famous novel from the late 1800s which was considered great in its day.  A tragic love story taking place in Cornwall where men are often referred to as Manxmen.  A young sailor named Pete is in love with a young woman whose family doesn't think he's good enough.  As Cornwall men often do, Pete goes off to find his fortune in Africa.  The young lady waits until she receives a letter reporting his death.  She turns to his best friend Philip and begins an affair.  Of course Pete returns alive and with a fortune.  Philip would rather begin a career as a Deemster (Justice) so she marries Pete.  But love can't be conquered, the young lady runs off to Philip who would rather not because he is a Deemster now.  But the young lady will not have Pete, who believes he is the father of her baby.  Thus lies the tragedy in the story.  A solid story of love from Hitchcock though the story in his film takes place in the 1920s, the narrative seems to be more appropriate for the novel's 1890s setting.  Likable but not the suspense Hitchcock, he would get to that with The Lodger and Blackmail which comes in a sound and silent version.",1331251200,,1384,4.368627450980392
7913424,3,B00000JQSP,"Naturally, as a Hitchcock silent film, particularly as his last one. this has considerable interest for movie historians. it also may interest the historian or sociologist with a concern for what one of the few great movie directors thought a useful script in 1929....from the viewpoint of what constituted a moral dilemma and what he conceived to be a resolution of the dilemma. Hitchcockians and other scholars will have to resort to evidence of his own life and thought, and his  existing career situation, to tell us whether that outcome was one he had the liberty to utilize, whether he was forced to use it, or whether he was shooting for what would be acceptable to some part of the audience he was seeking to find favor with. He makes very clear in his next to concluding scene what he (or possibly the screen writer or book author-if there was one) thought would be the response in a community such as that in which the story is set.
As a footnote, , without violating the oath not to reveal important  points, the circumstances under which the man and woman in the case did what they did seems completely to exonerate them of a charge of immorality insofar as the best friend is concerned. No doubt that in 1927, however, premarital sex would have been disapproved of by people of this type.
I really cannot recommend a silent drama such as this for its entertainment value..although, some, no doubt, will be gratified. For professional or amateur students of the film or of social morality, it should have some value.",1328400000,,1528,4.697761194029851

Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Distributor: Sono Art-World Wide Pictures
Release Date: January 21, 1929

The Manxman is Alfred Hitchcock's last silent film before he switched over to sound with Blackmail (1929). This movie is about a fisherman named Pete Quilliam and his childhood friend Philip Christian. Pete is in love with a girl named Kate but Kate's father disapproves of their marriage so he goes off to Africa to first make some money. He tells Philip to look after her while he is gone but Kate and Philip end up falling in love. Since Kate promised she'd wait for Pete she still ends up marrying him upon his return but she also has an affair with Philip and things start to turn ugly as Pete starts to learn more and more about what is going on. The film is based off of a novel and the story is very good and interesting although it seems to follow Hitchcock's typical theme of a love triangle which he has in many of his films.

The acting in the movie is very good overall with Carl Brisson as Pete. He pulls off happiness, sadness, anger, and concern all very well which is a wide spectrum of emotion for one actor. Malcolm Keen plays Philip who does a less spectacular but still decent job. And then there is Anny Ondra who plays Kate and she does a worthwhile job at showing love for Philip but not for Pete. So while all of the actors do a good job it is really Brisson who steals the show.

All of the special effects in the film seem pretty good with each of the sets looking nice. The courtroom, dock, house, and just about everything else looks right. And during a drowning scene it also looks pretty real. The musical score is mediocre and feels like it's just a lot of recycled music from earlier Hitchcock films but at least it gets the job done.

Overall this film isn't perfect by any means but it does have a lot of positive qualities which make it worth watching. The plot is really interesting and entertaining if you aren't already sick of Hitchcock's love triangle theme and the acting in the film is overall pretty good. And the special effects here are great even if the film does have some mediocre music. I'd say that this is one of Hitchcock's better silent films so give it a watch if you get the chance.

7913426,4,B00000JQSP,"This is a tragic, woeful tale-very early Hitchcock.

We are introduced to the fine actor, Carl Brisson.  His performance is super-expressive (expected, considering it's a silent film), however, his is a performance to be remembered. You really root for this guy, especially when his Woman does him wrong.  Carl is the backbone of this dreadully long, long,  tragedy.

Don't get me wrong, Anny does her part too!  When she mouths, ""I am having a baby"" directly to the viewer, I was delighted.

You'll notice the pacing and editing of the movie are frustrating, however, in its entirety, i still believe this film works.  It's a rarity, and something I'm glad to have watched.  I only wish Mr. Brisson had produced more than three films before his untimely (and early) death.

And you'll want this as a reminder that the fruits of Hitchcocks genius were in the larval stages and just absolutely fascinating to watch.",1044921600,,914,4.876623376623376
7913427,4,B00000JQSP,"Note: this review refers to the 14-DVD boxed set and not just to Volume 1.
  No film buff and certainly no film major should be without the boxed set of 14 DVDs that Laserlight has issued under the umbrella title of <The Alfred Hitchcock Collection>. The DVDs are organized in no particular order, some containing only one film, some two, while two of them have a full film and an episode from the old ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" TV series of the 1950s. They all have a trailer of more recent Hitchcock films and they all have an embarrassingly bad introduction by Tony Curtis, whose connection with these films and with English enunciation is vague at best.
  The gems of the collection are ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1934), ""The 39 Steps"" (1935) and ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1939). Of the earlier talkies, ""Young and Innocent"" has the quintessential plot of an innocent man and a girl who somehow winds up with him being chased by the police. ""Rich and Strange"" (1932) is not a thriller but has a shivery sequence as a couple on a sinking boat sees the water seeping into their cabin--just before it stops sinking.
  ""Jamaica Inn"" (1939) has an over the top performance by Charles Laughton (whose dialogue is hard to follow even on this restored version) and the first appearance of Maureen O'Hara. And for once, Robert Newton plays the Good Guy. ""Sabotage"" (1936) is based on a Joseph Conrad tale and has the famous scene of the boy on a bus with a bomb on his lap. (Later, Hitchcock commented he should not have let it go off.) ""Secret Agent"" (1936) gives us a young John Gielgud as a spy who kills the wrong man, Peter Lorre in a very bizarre role (helped or hindered by his drug-taking on and off the set), and the suavest villain of them all--Robert Young!
  ""Number 17"" (1932) is one of the films Hitchcock did not want to film, and he gave us a great spoof on the genre of the spooky houses, diamond smugglers, and derring-do. ""Murder"" (1930) boasts a super cool Herbert Marshall as a jurist who reluctantly says guilty at a woman's murder trial and then spends the rest of the film proving her innocent.
More fascinating is ""Blackmail"" (1929), which existed in silent and talking versions. We have the latter and the often commented upon scene in which Hitchcock plays with the soundtrack so that only the word ""knife"" can be heard during the last part of a long monologue. Another trick he was forced into was the use of a British actress reading out the lines of the foreign-born heroine.
  ""The Skin Game"" (1931) is weakest of the talkies included in this set; and indeed the dialogue is almost impossible to understand.
Of the silents, ""The Lodger"" (1927) is in the worst shape but it shows very clearly the influence of the silent German film on Hitchcock's early (and later) technique. Of course the long takes of a face staring into the camera are laughable today; but this is an historical document and demands a certain degree of detachment. ""The Ring"" (1927) does strain credibility, while it shows Hitchcock's love for show business of any sort, even circus freakshows and boxing.
  ""The Manxman"" (1929) is slow and predictable with its love triangle, a misreported death, and the return of the husband. ""Easy Virtue"" (1927) is based on a Noel Coward play, which it follows only half way through the film, and shows a sympathetic view of the ""woman with a past""--in this case, a divorce--together with a condemnation of those who cannot accept her. More Social Studies than good drama here.
  However, ""The Farmer's Wife"" (1928) is quite funny once the somewhat jerky widower offers himself to three unlikely women while his housekeeper loves him in silence and has to assist him in his wooing spree.
  One feature of these DVDs you will probably not need is the ability to hear the talkies in English, Spanish, Chinese or Japanese; or to subtitle the dialogue cards in the silents in the last three languages.
  A strange feature of these DVDs is that they immediately take you into the film rather than into the menu. This should be changed in future printings.
  So all in all, I would guess you would want to see some of the talkies many, many times, some of the silents less often, and some of them never again. But once more, this is a very valuable set for students and just plain lovers of film history, especially the part played in that history by Hitchcock.",975628800,37,4387,4.636129032258064

Cabe destacar que esto no fue obra de una gran empresa sino de LaserLight Video, pero es algo que los grandes estudios deberan tomar como ejemplo, hartos ya de ver pelculas con extras sin subttulos.

I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running  time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is  perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the  price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about.  Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been  proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not  even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe  this DVD as a 'Special Edition' ?",961891200,5,700,4.552
