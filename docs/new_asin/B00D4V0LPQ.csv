8589646,5,B00D4V0LPQ,"What a great band. Sorry to see him and Keith Emerson leave us. May their memory be eternal. There are two of these the other is Greg in his white jacket...and this one has only his face and to me recording is better. Buy it, good band as well.",1489708800,,244,4.0
8589647,5,B00D4V0LPQ,Having met Greg in the late 90's I can tell you he was one of the most genuine celebs I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Been a fan of his through all the bands he played in or formed. This concert was nothing less than fantastic. I would definitely recommend any fan to watch it! May his music live on and may he rest in peace.,1486166400,3,332,3.970149253731343

8589652,5,B00D4V0LPQ,If you have been a long time fan you may have wondered what the sound of ELP would be like with Greg Lake's complete influence.  Now you will know  You may not like it but I thought it was brilliant.  Go for it and make up your own mind . Go ELP. Go Greg Lake. The show that never ends.,1415577600,4,286,3.7333333333333334
