8491925,3,B0063EO74M,"Bitter conflicts between divorced parents affect their kids development in emotion, social and behavior in a negative way; kids blame themselves for their parents' problem; they may become angry, stressed and depressed; it's an invariably frightening and confused time for them.  To help them through this time, Manny tries to provide structure, warmth and emotional support along with positive reinforcement.
I expected this drama to be more of a comedy rather than a serious drama.",1506902400,,483,5.44
8491926,4,B0063EO74M,"Not many men ever seek a job as a nanny but in MANNY (male nanny) the lead does. He is articulate, handsome, youthful, and an Ivy League school graduate who knows his job. He takes a job as a manny with a divorced mother of two. One of the two is a kindergarten boy who misses his father immensely and bonds immediately with the manny. The other is a bratty ten year old girl who in her brattiness will likely become the Evil Witch of most Korean comedies, including this one. The mother has a nasty foul-tempered sister who as President of her modeling agency runs roughshod over her models. The sister is harsh and mean to the manny until she rather unbelievably falls for him. The connection between mother and manny brings in more than the inevitable plot complications of Korean dramas. Here the manny has to struggle with the ethics of his profession which forbid any fraternizing. If one is used to the theatrics of Korean comedy (the facial muggings, the frequent cries of ""what"", the incessant whining of the female leads, the shallowness of the female sidekicks) then one can sit back and enjoy the interlocking and often cross purposes machinations of the cast to see who winds up with whom. In MANNY I cared enough to give it four stars.",1400889600,,1249,4.580357142857143
