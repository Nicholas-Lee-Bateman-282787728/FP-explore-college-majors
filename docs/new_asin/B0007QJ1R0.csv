8050497,5,B0007QJ1R0,"This is a short program (53 minutes) combining views of famous paintings at the Prado with excellent Spanish music by 3 of the greatest Spanish musicians of their time. I bought this to have a video recording of pianist Alicia de Larrocha, but Andres Segovia and Victoria de los Angeles were also excellent. The music was at turns moving and lively, and the glory of Spain really shines through. I thought the video and audio quality were very good for something that dated from 1967. There is no information about the composers or their music - the only audio besides the music describes some of the paintings - so it is not as informative as it could have been but it is a good DVD nonetheless. I couldn't help but notice that when this movie was made, 50 years ago, Franco was still in power. It is a testament to artists' resilience that they were still able to produce such great music in spite of the circumstances.",1504915200,3,921,4.520958083832335
8050498,5,B0007QJ1R0,"But this DVD includes much more than paintings by El Greco, Goya and Velasquez. It has musical performances from Andres Segovia on guitar and performances by Victoria de los Angeles soprano, Alicia de Larrocha on piano and  Spanish dances and chorus.

8050499,1,B0007QJ1R0,If I could have given this DVD a zero I would have.  Not what expected and music not good.,1233705600,,90,3.736842105263158
8050500,2,B0007QJ1R0,"I bought this as a ""filler"" or lesson for a sub if I needed something easy to prepare.  I showed it to my Spanish 4 students recently and they rated it ""OK"" meaning it wasn't the worst thing in the world.  I like the fact that they are introduced to Andrs Segovia.  I have postcards of many of the works of art presented, so I can use those to enhance what they saw.

I am not enamored of it, but will use it in case of emergency.",1197331200,4,430,3.9080459770114944
8050501,4,B0007QJ1R0,"A lovely but, alas, incomplete selection of Spanish music, art and architecture. It was served up with gentle elegance. I loved it and now wish that I could find a disc about Spanish art and another about Spanish music.

With the accents involved I wish subtitles had been available.",1156291200,7,283,4.775510204081633
8050502,5,B0007QJ1R0,"You can't possibly miss out this one even though it only runs a bare 53 min.

Here each frame is a gem and and every note is overbrimming with music and the two are so well interwoven. In case you don't know who Segovia is, he is Casals to the cello (or even more) and we also have Larrocha playing in her sleeveless dress so that we could see the whole of her forearms. Her hands are so small and yet so agile and rhythmic, an overall more inspiring and exciting sight than even Pires. Of course, we also have Victoria de Los Angeles who sings as good as Bartoli, if not better. For viewers who like her singing, they may as well check out an EMI production featuring her.

And of course, there is also the great heritage in oils by El Greco and Goya and Velasquez. There are even some highly prefessional dancers and other musicians with period instruments and costumes illustrating the music as depicted in the oils.

Not to be missed by any music or art lover.",1130976000,13,964,4.314917127071824
