You can see a preview at collagevideo com & here's their description:

A uniquely graceful program blending movements from yoga, Pilates, dance and sports. These controlled, fluid routines are sure to improve your balance, flexibility and strength. A Joffrey Ballet-trained dancer and IDEA Instructor of the Year, Kari designed this program to provide ""focus and body awareness along with a new confidence."" It's somehow both relaxing and challenging - your body just gently flows through a precisely programmed series of angles and lines in space. This is a beautifully produced workout featuring meticulous cuing, exquisite photography and very soothing instrumental music. 1998. (49 min.)",1182643200,,922,5.258503401360544
7925823,4,B00004WZ4Y,"ANGLES, LINES, AND CURVES is a nice blend of yoga and pilates-type movements, yet it is different from both of these disciplines.  Instructor Kari guides you through simple, focused movements which target mainly the lower body with some focus on the abdominals.  The workout is broken down into different segments, with each 5-6 minute segment consisting of several different exercises; following the warm-up, most of the segments are done on the floor.  Some of the movements are challenging, but overall, it the workout is not overly strenuous, and the segmented format helps the time (45 minutes total) go by quickly.  This a nice video for lighter days, for taking a break from weight training, or for just feeling stretched and relaxed.",1072742400,6,741,5.099173553719008
