1371226,5,B00004Y6AD,"This is an excellent step workout video. I've tried many and this is the best by far. The choreography is very creative and never dull; the instructor is an excellent and energetic teacher; and the live music gets you really into the mood. Too short but if you're a busy mother of two pre-schoolers like me it works well fitting it into your daily schedule. I must have used this video over one hundred times since last October and I am still not bored. The inclusion of latin moves such as the mamba, changa and open salsa makes the experience even more enbjoyable. A lot of fun and it's great for your legs.",1066089600,,609,4.398230088495575
1371227,4,B00004Y6AD,"This is one of my favorite step videos.  Kendall Hogan keeps you moving and motivated. If you are new to stepping this isn't a good video to start with because a lot of the time he doesn't give you any warning about new moves or the sequences.  But if you are an intermediate to advanced stepper then after doing the video a couple of times you will be able to follow along no problem.  At times the combos use simple moves that don't keep your heartrate up, but if you are intermediate to advanced stepper you will know how to modify the moves to make them higher intensity.  I only wish he would stop for a water break or to check your heartrate or intensity level.
I highly recommend this video to intermediate to advanced steppers if you want to sweat and burn calories. This is an awesome workout!",1056499200,2,802,4.3624161073825505
1371228,3,B00004Y6AD,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with stepping, but my fitness and coordination are pretty good and I found this workout to be too complicated.  It was hard to keep up with the footwork, although I was barely breathing hard at all.  The sequences change fairly quickly so once you ""get it"", they're on to a different footwork sequence.  If you love step workouts and are experienced with stepping, you'd probably like this video.  If you're just looking for a change of pace from non-step workouts, you may want to look elsewhere.",1043193600,,536,4.670212765957447
1371229,5,B00004Y6AD,"I thought this video was wonderful!  My only critique is that I wish it was longer.  I originally bought the video because I had Kendall as an instructor years ago and I knew that I liked him as a step teacher.  Turns out all these years later, he's still got it!!!  Definitely a keeper.",989452800,4,287,4.2592592592592595
1371230,4,B00004Y6AD,"Ok,ok, so besides the fact that  females viewers get to gaze at this gorgeous, graceful man for 30 minutes;this video is definitely worth your money. It departs from your run-of-the-mill step workout in that the moves are fresh,the live drumming infectious,and the latin twist  towards the end keeps your energy level peaked. Two big toes up Kendell!",981072000,5,350,5.12280701754386
1371231,4,B00004Y6AD,"This video is for the intermediate to advanced exerciser.  I've been doing step aerobics for the past three years and found this video challenging, but not frustrating.  The instructor uses good calls which makes it easy to follow.  The step routine is mixed with a few interval ""power move"" sections which really gets your heart pumping.  There's a live drummer in the background playing  motivating music.  The beat really gets you moving.  You will need a step for this video.  My only complaint is that it's only 30 minutes long.  It's a great video when you're crunched for time, but I prefer a longer cardio workout.  You will work up a good sweat, however.",978307200,9,663,4.7368421052631575
1371232,1,B00004Y6AD,"This tape is full of prissy dancey steps, and half the time he isn't even on the bench!  If you want to do some sissy shimmying instead of working out, buy this tape.  If you want to exercise, go elsewhere!  Several of his transitions even seem unsafe, particularly the turn flow into the V-step.  If he were half as worried about giving you a workout as he is about being so perky, this tape would be killer!  As it is, I'm afraid, the only thing killed was my wallet by wasting my money on this worthless junk!",978048000,6,512,4.237113402061856
1371233,4,B00004Y6AD,This is a medium paced workout.  I like it because I can use my step at 8 inches with this one and not hurt my knees.  The moves are not too complicated.  But you still work up a good sweat in 30 seconds.,1141084800,,204,3.697674418604651
1371234,3,B00004Y6AD,"I am a fan of Crunch tapes but find this one a little annoying. Cueing is inconsistent -- sometimes on time, sometimes a beat late to follow -- and it can be hard to make out what he's saying over the music and drums. Choreography is fun but the workout ends just as I'm getting going. I wish they had put all the segments together at the end for a full routine. I'll probably stick with the tape just to master the choreography, but for a 30-minute step workout I much prefer Reebock Versa Dance Step.",1132012800,,502,4.239583333333333
1371235,5,B00004Y6AD,"If you want one of the very best instructor for step please buy this CD.  I think that his timing, music and energy is the very best for long term viewing.",1127433600,,155,4.0
1371236,4,B00004Y6AD,"This is a fast moving workout, with an upbeat and good-looking instructor, that's not too tough, not too easy. The moves are catchy enough after watching once or twice, the music is engaging, and the step moves are a mix of the usual and some creative ones. One problem I had was that you're seldom told what to do with your arms. So it's primarily a lower body step workout, although the final segment is mostly on the floor. Definitley worth a try.",1118361600,,450,4.433734939759036
1371237,4,B00004Y6AD,"I have had this tape for a while.  It doesn't seem to get boring (to me at least!)  I can take it low or make it high impact.  Working out at home, I switch out cardio videos.  I always seem to workout to this tape over and over, happily!",1105142400,2,238,3.795918367346939
1371238,3,B00004Y6AD,"This is a good step video. Kendall Hogan is very energetic and the music is great.  His ""class"" is made up of very buxom women with six-pack stomachs that make an effort to out shake each other and try to look provocative.  I'm not a prude; it just gets annoying after 5 minutes.  Had I know they were there I would not have bought it.  I prefer exercise tapes with real people working out.  Of course now it may sell well for those who like to watch that sort of thing.",1095724800,3,470,4.1208791208791204
1371239,4,B00004Y6AD,"Love Kendal, love the energy of the tape and the workout is not boring, and getting the moves is challenging.  I am a dancer, but K needs to work on his queuing.  There are many steps to a single routine and I just need help remembering what foot should step first at the start of each run. Still glad I bought it.",1078963200,2,314,4.048387096774194
1371240,5,B00004Y6AD,"I have been using this step video for the past 2 years in conjunction with weights and other cardio workouts (running, eliptical trainer) at the gym.  I usually use it around 5 times a week and can honestly say that I never get bored.  The main reason I think is that Kendell is amazing! He is motivating and energetic and not in any way obnoxious.  I feel like I have my own personal instructor!  I also love the live drums. It adds a level of energy that you just can't get otherwise.  I would also love to find other videos with this instructor.  You will not be dissappointed with this purchase!",1078272000,,599,4.351351351351352
1371241,4,B00004Y6AD,"I bought this video primarily because it had Kendell Hogan on the cover. Hogan is one of the hosts of Bodyshaping on ESPN and, besides episodes of this show, I also had a full length workout video that came with the Bodyshaping step with Hogan as the instructor which is one of my favorites. I was excited to find this video.
Crunch Fat Blaster: the Next Step is a 30 minute workout that is not too difficult to learn. It is fast paced without the careful cueing of beginner's tapes, so I would recommend this one to Intermediate level steppers. It starts with an energetic 5 minute warm-up and then goes into the 5 minute first segment featuring an over-the-top of the step ""Z"" combination and knee lifts. The second segment is 6 minutes long and includes an L step, across-the-top, mambo and lunge combination. This segment ends with a ""challenge"" of repeaters that are not very challenging. They are just about 8 reps or so which would not be too difficult for even the beginner.
The final segments, which on most tapes are the most difficult, are actually very slow on this video. The third segment has a Latin theme with turn step cha-cha moves with some lunges that Hogan teaches in slow motion. I'm not sure why the half time moves are in the final segment. I would think they were more appropriate for the first section or warm-up. The third section ends with a couple more ""challenges"" which are, in fact, pretty easy: power squats and lunges. Another combination follows. I am not sure if this is a fourth segment or a prelude to the cool down. The moves are all off the step with a ""salsa"" step reminiscent of the warm-up. It lasts about 4 minutes. Finally, there is a 3 minute cool down.
This video is fun and energetic and is nice for those days one just wants a quick workout. Kendell Hogan is very motivating which is a plus, but the final sections of the workout are almost too easy. I can feel my heart rate plunging. Still, if you want something different to add to your step collection for a reasonable price, I recommend this one.",1071014400,6,2050,4.498659517426273
1371242,3,B00004Y6AD,"I got this tape looking for some variety to add to my step routines. I'd consider myself an intermediate stepper. This one isn't very challenging, the cueing leaves a lot to be desired and, being as hip and cool as they all are, there's even a woman wearing wedged sneakers doing the workout. PUH-LEEZE! This one is mildly entertaining but if you're looking for a real workout, skip this one.",1069286400,,392,4.614285714285714

7926669,5,B00004Y6AD,"This video is upbeat and fun to do. The instructor is very motivating and the routines are in sync with the beats. The downside is the unavailability of the product. My video jammed in the VCR and I have not been able to replace it. Looking to purchase it again, perhaps on DVD.",1386720000,,278,4.264150943396227
7926670,5,B00004Y6AD,This exercise CD is great for getting and keeping me motivated to exercise. I enjoy his high and cheerful energy every time I work out to it.,1386547200,,141,4.2592592592592595
7926671,2,B00004Y6AD,"I was looking for a CD, not a VHS. I had a VHS with Kendell Hogan step aerobics which I loved. I wanted it on a CD. When I got it, it was VHS. I  guess I was so excited about finding it that I hadn't seen that it was not in the format I needed. I can't even believe that VHS is still being sold at merchants online today.",1354665600,,321,3.585714285714286
7926672,5,B00004Y6AD,"I LOVE Kendall Hogan because he brings FUN to working out. To the person who said their heart rate didn't get up high enough, all you need to do is add more risers to your step and put some funk in your dancing! You can add intensity to any exercise! Now if you just want a hardcore step workout, no fun included, this is not the DVD for you. Kendall has been in the fitness industry for many years and is in great shape so he knows what he's doing! I LOVE IT, its soooo much fun! I have other step videos that are boring as hell and I never pull them out. I have this one on VHS and I still use it. If you like Zumba, or just grooving in a workout, you will like this one! LOVE YA KENDALL!!!",1346630400,,692,3.880281690140845
7926673,5,B00004Y6AD,I had forgotten how good this video was. I had it once but gave it away when I gave away my step. Now I am into stepping again. I love the choreography and Kendall's instructions are so easy to follow. It makes it fun so you are not even aware that it is over until it is over. I will recommend this video.,1339977600,,306,3.873015873015873
7926674,4,B00004Y6AD,"Not bad at all, definitely not boring. Good instructor with a good mix of fresh step combos. I had no problem following his cueing, I thought it was very good. In order to keep my heart rate up though, I had to insert more jumps especially in the last combo before the cool down. I also used light hand weights and a 8"" step. In just 30 minutes I got a decent cardio workout.",1226620800,,375,4.081081081081081
7926675,5,B00004Y6AD,"let me start by saying that kendall is one of my fav instructors...he is always motivating, no matter how many times i watch the same tape.  this is a pretty good workout for only about 30 mins...you'll definitely get winded and you can modify your intensity so it should take you a long time to feel you've mastered it.  he goes through 3 different routines that keep it interesting.  i'd buy it again if i needed to.",1210723200,,418,4.402597402597403
7926676,5,B00004Y6AD,I have owned this video for many years & have loved it.  The steps are not so complex that you get frustrated but have enough to them that you do get a good solid workout.  I only wish it also came in a DVD.  I have recently lost my VHS copy...loaned to a friend.  I would love to see more videos by Kendall Hogan.  He's a very likable & motivating guy.,1196812800,,353,3.915492957746479
