8431624,1,B004J4T1MQ,"The cover makes you believe this was a new documentary about Mike Tramp's White Lion.
In fact it is an old documentary with the original members (including Vito Brata). It was already released by Brentwood Home Video under the title ""Hard N' Heavy - Unauthorized. 4 Rockumentaries incl. Skid Row, Damn Yankees, Slaughter and Wite Lion.
The quality is not that great, plus this seems to be a code-free release from Germany.
So inform yourself before you purchase this DVD - you might have seen the footage before.
Not to be recommended.",1348963200,2,535,4.826086956521739
8431625,1,B004J4T1MQ,"I ordered this because my face is on the DVD cover and we didn't authorize any footage other than the BANG YOUR HEAD festival released in 2008 (you can find it via amazon search).

This video is basically some unused interview footage of the ""classic"" line up...not the one you've known since 2005.

They're in a bus in the UK basically talking to an interviewer.  It gives no glimpse into the history of the band. It has 3 partial performances (Lights and Thunder, Wait and Broken Heart) from the UK tour it appears.

It's incomplete, it's as if not all the footage is here.

Poorly put together (you'd think the guy doing the packaging would know that the guys in the photo and the guys on the dvd printing are NOT the guys interviewed in the footage).

I'll be returning this one for a full refund and request they stop using my image to sell their DVD's as I'm not even on it..

I'd expect our attorney's (Dewey, Cheatem & Howe) will be reaching out to them quite soon..
