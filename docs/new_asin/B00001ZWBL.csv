mother ship, the carrier, It is the most dangerous job in the world and it is the
aggressiveness of the pilot that keeps him alive.  If he can't shepherd a hostile
enemy plane away from the carrier, he attacks and kills.
In August of '81, two Morimar Kadafi war planes armed with missiles went on the
attack against the carrier John F. Kennedy in the Mediterranean. ""Defend yourselves,""
President Reagan ordered and two Naval aviators in F-14 fleet defense interceptors
destroyed the pair in seconds.",1383350400,,585,4.735294117647059
7915057,4,B00001ZWBL,Thank you 'dogstardvd' for your quick delivery. Received my copy of 'The Story of Top Gun' on DVD new and factory sealed very quick! Great digital quality. Much better than my VHS version! Excellent topic for those interested in the history of the Navy's top gun pilots. Could have given us a little more material on the extras but overall a good DVD.,1219881600,,351,4.587301587301587
7915058,3,B00001ZWBL,"'The Story of Top Gun' is a good DVD, but it would better be described as a DVD recording of a regular 48-minute TV show, along the lines of what you might see on The History Channel's Modern Marvels.

It is definitely better than average, but it is not outstanding either. It does contain a large amount of well-shot footage of F-4 Phantoms and Mig-17s in action (there are NO F-14s or more modern planes which is deceptive from the cover which displays an F-18). It is also a good, albeit breif, introduction to the story behind the creation of Top Gun.

In conclusion: A nice watch, but too short and not enough depth. The lack of F-14 footage is astonishing since one would expect to see F-14s and newer planes since Top Gun didn't end in 1970.  The film takes us no farther than the early 70s in its documentation of Top Gun and leaves the viewer longing for more.",1124841600,6,869,4.385093167701863
7915059,5,B00001ZWBL,"This film contains rare and excellent footage of the real Top Gun and a history on how it started from the grim days of the Vietnam War. The highlight of this documentary is the rare film footage of the legendary U.S Navy F-4 Phantom in action. This is a can't miss for anyone interested in the history and the people behind Top Gun as well as watching the F-4 ""Rhino"" over Vietnam.",1120176000,,382,4.319444444444445
7915060,2,B00001ZWBL,"This DVD is purely a history of the origin of the Top Gun school and NOT anything about the training programme there .The footage is very old and whole focus is on vietnam .
The additional sections are a 60 - 80 seconds clips of pilots suiting up and then a F-18 flying . Dont buy it for more then 2 dollars including shipping ...thats all its worth",1053043200,35,349,4.147058823529412
7915061,4,B00001ZWBL,"this program is all about the creation of top gun and its first class and i never knew hardly any of this stuff.  it's a real documentary not just a video exploiting the interest in top gun.  it tells a story.  lots of very good combat and f-4 footage.  good interviews too with most of the original top gun people.  don't be fooled by the cover though, there is extremely little f-18 footage in this whole show.  if you're interested in fighter planes, it's a great program.",1017100800,13,475,4.402298850574713
7915062,5,B00001ZWBL,"This is an absolute marvel of a video. The film quality is superb, unlike some others. It is a very gripping historical account of who, what and why Top Gun is. Now that the original Top Gun is no longer at NAS Miramar, and now that things on the military scene are changing, Top Gun represents and elite element of history.  Get this video. I wish the producers made more films like this.  This is not some motion picture fantasy, this is the real deal...",990576000,25,456,4.352941176470588
