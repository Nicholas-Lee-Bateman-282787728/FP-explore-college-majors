8223379,5,B000WGZGVK,"The SPEED DEMONS disc is rounds 1 and 2 of the 2005 Canadian Motocross racing series. Round 1 is from Mission Raceway, Mission, BC. Round 2 is from The Wastelands, Nanaimo, BC.

These are pretty much the standard broadcast of the MX1 and MX2 classes from each round, as seen on SPEED TV. This is not a bad thing as they are well produced and full of good MX racing action in various conditions.

The stars of the series were Jean-Sebastian Roy in the MX1 class and young Ryan Villipoto in the MX2 class. This was the first season of the new classification (from 250 and 125) and some of the 4-strokes are starting to show their heads, but the majority of bikes are still 2-strokes.

Each race episode features a ""freestyle"" montage to some decent new music and there is a podium and interview bit at the end, but this is primarily just good hard racing.

The better value is to get the 2-pack with HIGH VOLTAGE RACING for $10, which has rounds 3 and 4 of the 2005 CMRC season.",1202169600,,976,4.346153846153846
