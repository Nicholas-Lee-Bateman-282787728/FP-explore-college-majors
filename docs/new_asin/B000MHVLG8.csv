8426319,1,B000MHVLG8,"Wouldn't even give the video a one star rating. It was terrible.  Only bought it because Vic Morrow was in it. He had only two or three scenes in movie for about five minutes total for the movie.  Sorry I purchased it.  Was not worth the money.

(Only gave the movie a one star rating because the review required a rating.)",1291161600,,323,4.245901639344262
