8654348,5,B00JX0W2QS,what a pleasure to see wingnut gracefully carving up one wave after another. if you love longboarding you will love this dvd. it's worth it just to have it on the screen in the living room with music playing. what's really cool is that wingy uses a number of interesting teaching methods to get you thinking about how to make the most out of your sessions. i don't do many recommendations - this dvd is inspirational for me.,1439251200,,424,4.448717948717949
