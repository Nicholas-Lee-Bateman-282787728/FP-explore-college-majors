4332783,2,B004DMIIP0,"Let me start by saying I'm a fan of gonzo action and over-the-top cinema in general. I love the latest bunch of Japanese B-Movies coming into the U.S. Market. Titles like ""Machine Girl"" and ""Tokyo Gore Police"" are pretty campy and certainly over-the-top, but are also fairly well made and cohesive. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for ""Alien vs. Ninja.""
From the trailer, you know what you're probably in for; gore, crazy ninja fights, Japanese dudes in rubber alien suits jumping around and tearing people apart. And yes, there is a lot of that stuff going on. However, there isn't much more to this title. There is essentially no plot. Bunch a ninjas are running around the forest doing something and some aliens land in meteors and start killing villagers and other ninja. The fights are fairly well done, though not as intense or violent as they probably should have been. They seem more like Power Ranger battles than anything else. The only real blood letting occurs when the aliens attack. From a gore-hound point of view, this film actually disappoints a bit since there isn't much on-screen gore that isn't a digital effect. Characters are fairly one dimensional and the gimmick of alien parasites taking over the captured ninja is underutilized.
If you can find this one at Red Box for a $1 rental, it's worth it for the few chuckles. But overall you'll be left feeling like Funimation edited out the best parts or that maybe the best parts didn't exist to begin with.",1298505600,6,1483,4.77431906614786
4332794,4,B004DMIIP0,I thought the alien was a little funny and it's suit didn't fit too well but the action was pretty good,1350950400,,103,3.9523809523809526
4332795,2,B004DMIIP0,"I had some hopes for this movie but found it to be a little uneven. While the best ninjas are really badass and does some nice tricks they are let down by a alien which almost destroyed the movie for me. It is not a big budget movie, but this alien looks just what it is, a man in an alien body suit. It tries to give some H.R.Giger resemblance  but it fails at that. It just doesn't give me the creeps as I was hoping for and rather make me laugh when its onscreen. In the first part of the movie the alien is hardly visible and that gives a much more scarier effect. Also a little letdown is that the aliens early on seems to be a mixed bag when it comes to their fighting powers. Early on they seems quite unapproachable (healing powers, travel under ground etc) but later on they seems to be fighting with just basic skills. And when one alien at one time picks up a sword and starts using it like an expert it just becomes hilarious. The film also have one Ninja character which is just stupidly annoying and you are basically routing for the alien to kill him early on. You really have to wonder how that ninja have survived so long. On the positive side the main two ninja characters make a good performance and really seems able to give the aliens some whooping. The female ninja in particular gives the movie a little extra edge than your run-of-the-mill ninja movies. In other words I found this movie just about watchable but would have no desire to watch it again.",1335052800,,1476,4.271428571428571
4332796,5,B004DMIIP0,"This movie is the equivalent of a lot of the SYFY original movies except in Japanese with a lot of practical ""effects"", man in suit, and some cgi.  CGI isn't great but thankfully they don't really depend on it for the action sequences which are very funny (my opinion).

These types of movies aren't for everyone.  If you enjoy watching what people call ""bad"" movies then you'll enjoy this.  Let's face it, the only differences between American action/sci fi (cough giant robots fighting other giant robots) and this type of movie are the budget and enjoyment.  These types of movies are MEANT to make you laugh and I equate laughing with enjoyment.

You will laugh at the ""crow"" scene for well over a minute.  That's the clear indication that the director made it funny on purpose.  Lots of funny stuff in this one; most people won't get the zombie puppets cursing like sailors in English though.  Very well made B action sci-fi/comedy movie.

I can't believe more people don't love this movie!  Awesome stuff!",1319328000,,1011,4.752873563218391
4332797,1,B004DMIIP0,"This is a really bad movie.
Why did they put it in blue-ray?
It was so bad that everybody, who was not brain dead,
walked out of the room after 5 minutes.
This movie should get 0 stars.",1315267200,,185,3.8947368421052633
4332798,1,B004DMIIP0,The best thing on this movie - is the box picture - the rest is really really bad. Special effects are at the level of maybe 50's or 60's - horrible. But I must admit I did finish the whole movie - just to see what happens - and the ending did not improve the impression.,1314576000,2,271,3.857142857142857
4332799,4,B004DMIIP0,"Early on this movie separates itself from its subgenre kin by demonstrating more innovative combat choreography than the earlier, Tokyo Gore Police era flicks (e.g., Meatball Machine, Machine Girl).  Some of these adroit maneuvers are cleverly executed, although clearly lacking the precision of modern Hong Kong cinema.  Of course, the combat has plenty of corny to go around as well.

 Much as in Predator a team of highly trained personnel encounter a youngster scared mute in the forest and then encounter an alien.  The first battle is like a cross between Predator, Tremors and Aliens--you'd probably have to see it to understand this reference combo.  The gore is ample, funny, well-delivered, and up to snuff with the higher budgeted Tokyo Shock flicks.  One dude explodes, legs are stripped to the bone, someone gets torn in half, and there's even an ""inner ass"" punch.

 The aliens are seem very familiar, modeled largely after the Alien alien, but with what appears to be a neck vagina from which Species-esque tendrils emerge.  There are holes on its head which house some alien larvae which Wrath of Khan their way into their victem's head.  These larvae then control you from within your brain (as in Meatball Machine).

 For some reason the combat becomes cornier and less deft when the ninjas face off against the aliens more directly.  The exploitative nature gets kicked up a notch as well in the form of suggestive choreography and an apparent sexual assault attempt by one of the aliens.  On the cornier side, the alien throws in some Street Fighter II Blanka rolling assaults and later sprouts Jeepers Creepers wings out of nowhere.  The final fight is the most silly but least skillful.

 Although I didn't hate it, this movie is simply not as cool as a lot of its cousins.  For a Tokyo Shocker, I'll give this a C-.

What to watch instead:  If you like your ninjas more supernatural than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and way more serious than Alien vs Ninja, then try Shinobi.  Shinobi is serious, has fantasy-driven ninjas with cool supernatural powers, and good martial arts coupled with solid action-camera work (i.e., you can see what they're doing).  Ninja Assassin and Ninja (the Scott Adkins one) are serious and American-made, but put little effort on innovative choreography.

However, if you think you like this sort of movie I'd suggest, Meatball Machine, Tokyo Gore Police, Robo-Geisha, pretty much anything else of such ilk.  I have better suggestions in my webpage post on the subgenre.",1309478400,3,2526,4.971360381861575
4332800,4,B004DMIIP0,This movie had action from beginning to end. The fighting in the movie was awesome. and the story line was good. Not bad for a foreign film,1308960000,3,139,4.185185185185185

4332802,1,B004DMIIP0,"Wow.  It would take days to explain how bad this is.  I sometimes enjoy bad b-movies, but not this one.

Well, that's all this movie is - one long string of embarrassing, cringe-worthy moments.  Please avoid.",1304726400,6,321,4.660714285714286
4332803,5,B004DMIIP0,"My review is going to be really short because this movie is so bad that it's honestly one of the funiest movies I've ever seen.  I kid you not I watched this movie with no expections and ended up laughing through the whole thing.  The plot is terrible, the acting sucks, and the special effects are cheap but that is what makes it so good.  When making this movie the creators must have known what they could expect because this flick doesn't lead you to believe that it is anything more than machine gun wielding ninjas and rubber suited aliens.  There is a automatic pistol in this movie and the period I would imagine is somewhere around 1600 which means that automatic weapons wouldn't be produced until nearly three hundred years later.  But in the grand scheme of things who the hell cares.  This movie is drop dead funny and that's why despite my overall opinion of this crap pile I'm giving it five stars.  Enjoy and remember to use the bathroom before you watch it.",1303689600,3,974,4.5
4332813,5,B004DMIIP0,"Greetings People!

I wish to inform you that Alien vs. Ninja is truly one of the most entertaining movies of the decade. It has horror, comedy, drama, action, and even a tad bit of something resembling romance (maybe).

Some people might think -Aliens and Ninjas? That could never happen! No way is this going to work!- as I did before watching this work of art. But, I assure you, it works out quite well--nearly as well as I imagine ZvN, Zombies vs. Ninjas, would turn out. Oh wait...the movie includes zombies vs ninjas! Thus it's proved to be just as exciting!

The aliens in AvN are certainly original, and definitely-not-at-all-inspired-by-'Alien'-the-hit-film. No resemblance what-so-ever. In fact, these aliens tunnel underground, bounce, curl up into spike balls, know how to swordfight and fire a gun, and even jump 50 meters...frequently without being seen! And I haven't even spoiled the ending fight for you.

The ninjas, for the most part, are badass. Except for the one comic-relief character who somehow manages to last for about 3/4 of the movie...Really that's my only complaint. The real ninjas twirl, wear tight leather pants, use some cool gadgets, and are generally all around Ninja. More need not be said.

Quite a spectacular morsel of entertainment, my only other complaint is that the fun only lasts for 81 minutes.",1303344000,16,1341,5.0225225225225225
4332814,4,B004DMIIP0,"The aliens do have a dolphin feel to them but there still cool looking and have some fun things about them, like rolling into a ball at the ninja's and they got these little guys who come out of the holes in their head and can go into the ninja's and control them, and their long tales can go back into their body and come back out at will. AVN is funny and gory. Some yucky deaths and some cool fight scenes. I enjoyed the fight between the alien and the girl, how she's flipping all over the place and riding the tail. The film is slow at the start but once the aliens appear, it's all fun til the end.",1302220800,12,604,4.0
4332815,5,B004DMIIP0,"A mysterious object falls to Japan unleashing hordes of Alien scum bent on conquering Earth and its up to the Ninjas to stop this alien invasion
who will win?

A gentle humorous action packed spoof of Alien Vs Predator not meant to be taken seriously nor is it offensive to fans of AVP like me.
intentionally cheesy. aliens in rubber suits taking on a band of Ninjas hell bent on destroying each other in comical show down that will
decide the fate of the world a funny combination. the Ninjas  if you think about it Ninjas are the human equivalent of the Predators with their stealth and cunning and  the fact that they are great fighters with interesting tools/ weapons though in the case of this movie the tools turn out to be rather useless part of the joke except for the last show down, and aliens being aliens with sense of humor through gestures and lethal and cruel as usual pretty similar except for the humor. loaded with cool action scenes and humor blood and gore and cheese i found this film to be enjoyable.

if your skeptical about this film i would recommend renting it but if your a fan of comical martial art action films and aliens and ninjas
i would buy it.

with respect thank you for reading my review and i hope it helps.",1302134400,3,1245,4.419213973799127
4332816,3,B004DMIIP0,"This movie is actually a tough one to rate. Is it a good movie? Probably not. But it doesn't pretend to be so you pretty much have to take it on its own terms.

Here's the scoop. A group of Ninja warriors on their way back from a recon mission see a fireball plummet to the earth. Before long they are beset by a quick, strong, nasty group of aliens hell bent on killing everything in sight. Said Ninjas need to boogie their way back to town in one piece to warn everyone.

This flick is a real hoot. It borrows from both Alien and Predator so it doesn't take a genius to see where they're going with this. It contains a fair number of anachronisms that play to a younger crowd. The body armor, hair styles and ink are all punked out. My guess is this is set in the late 19th century but one of the Ninja is an inventor who has miraculously engineered a fully automatic weapon. The group themselves look as though they came out of an Anime feature. Two of the guys are impossibly good looking. One is a gorgeous gal and there is a buffoon along for comic relief. The monsters are of the rubber suit variety and not terribly well designed or constructed. These monsters are really fast until they come face to face with our heroes where they inexplicably slow down a bit. Some of the fight scenes are impossible which makes them all the more fun to watch. Some are just so-so.

I couldn't help but think that this would make a really cool straight up movie. The 'Predator' premise can be used during any historical period, and the mystique surrounding Ninja warriors makes for a good match-up. The producers and director play this for the yuks which is cool, and, at eighty minutes, it doesn't ware out its welcome.

If your looking for mindlessly fun entertainment you'd be hard pressed to find a better outing than this.",1301529600,9,1821,4.394658753709199
4332817,4,B004DMIIP0,"Alien Vs. Ninja is yet another ultra-gory action/horror hybrid from Japan. And it's a good one, but it could have been a lot better if the aliens wouldn't have looked so goofy. But thank goodness that no matter how funny the aliens looks, they still cause a lot of carnage. There are mucho decapitations and ninjas being torn limb from limb.",1300838400,,341,4.60655737704918

4332819,5,B004DMIIP0,I bought this thinking it would be alright and boy was I wrong.

The charecter design was good and the music fit in well with the scenes.,1299628800,5,278,3.8596491228070176
4332820,4,B004DMIIP0,"The story doesn't get much simpler; in ancient Japan, bloodthirsty alien monsters land in a meteor and come between two warring ninja clans. Essentially, this is a dumb movie. But it's just so wild and and fun that you simply don't care! So what if the ninjas flip people off or have have stylish haircuts that didn't exist in the 16th century; it somehow adds to this flick's surreal zaniness. Remember, we're dealing with a really low-budget movie here, so don't expect the CGI to be top-notch or anything like that. But most everything is practical anyway; the monsters are guys in suits, the martial are regular people performing flips and high-kicks, and the occasionally exuberant amount of gore is practical, mixed with CG techniques to give it more of a visceral oomph.

A 4/5. Some inconsistencies here and there that bugged me a bit, as well as a few moments that were just a little too silly, but for the most part, ""AVN"" is a silly, gory, ludicrous leave-your-brain-out-on-the-patio fun.",1299628800,4,999,4.842105263157895
