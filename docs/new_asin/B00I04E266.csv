8637742,1,B00I04E266,This DVD had terrible sound quality -to a point where some parts had to be captioned to understand what was being said. The outside cover was all written in Spanish. I believe this DVD was pirated and I will not be purchasing from this seller again.,1515456000,,249,4.434782608695652
8637743,5,B00I04E266,"An over-looked ALIEN film in it's own right, although 20th Century Fox was originally underwhelmed, to say the least, about David Fincher's film continuation of the series. This is a much darker version closer in tone to the original than ALIENS was. This includes the original release and Fincher's Director's Cut. Even Sigourney Weaver placed this film high on her list of accomplishments. Fincher was the Director behind Brad Pitt's and Morgan Freeman's dark film SEVEN, which put Fincher on the 'A' list of Directors. As the years have passed, 20th Century Fox and those in the audience that didn't like this film, realized it was a classic film to advance this series and when Weaver died in the film, everyone thought the ALIEN franchise was over. Until ALIEN RESURRECTION was released and that, my friends is another story for another day. Great seller service by the way and I am extremely happy with this steelbook contained film.",1477180800,,939,4.949367088607595
