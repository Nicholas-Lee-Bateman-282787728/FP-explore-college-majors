6140138,5,B00H83OEKY,This was a once in a lifetime trip and game for a 1976 graduate of MSU.  So great to have the DVD to watch whenever I want to relive an amazing dream trip come true.,1401235200,2,165,3.7142857142857144
6140139,5,B00H83OEKY,"What can I say?  It's the Spartans.  It's the Rose Bowl.  It's the Spartans WINNING the Rose Bowl!  What else could you want, except maybe a cold one or two while watching it?",1398384000,,175,4.212121212121212
6140140,5,B00H83OEKY,"If you are a MSU FAN this is a must have for your memorabilia collection.  This is a real professionally done ESPN video gem that has every single play of the 100th Rose Bowl, a fantastic win for my underdog Spartans.  I was really impressed with the quality of this DVD.  I highly recommend this masterpiece for the entire Spartan Nation and other Big 10 fans!!!  A Historic well played game, enjoyable for all football fans!!!",1396828800,,428,4.592105263157895
6140141,5,B00H83OEKY,"This was a) a great game, and b) a great setting (the backdrop, the style of play for both teams, and the fact this was the 100th game, as well as the ""last"" Big10/Pac 12 matchup for the foreseeable future).  And of course, there were no issues with Amazon's customer service at all.

But: why not a blu-ray of this game?  Given the historic significance of this game, why not?  As far as the DVD goes: it could have also had ""extas"" to enhance the viewing experience.  For example: game stats, DVD commentary, season highlights, or the pre-game ceremonies could could have been shown in the Special Features section.

These issues aside, the DVD was worth every penny to relive the moment of this greatest of sports' spectacles.",1394928000,3,729,4.65625
6140142,5,B00H83OEKY,I went to the 100 rose owl game so this was just perfect for what I was wanting it for,1394496000,,86,3.35
6140143,4,B00H83OEKY,"As a Michigan State Spartan fan, the game itself deserves five stars, but I'm subtracting one star for the bare-bones production of this DVD. After a 26 year wait to return to the Rose Bowl, I echo the sentiments of other reviewers that MSU fans deserve a little better. I'd love to have this game available in bluray, but it doesn't look like that will happen.

Unlike other DVDs of sports games I own, the game itself is not divided up into ""chapters"", so there is no easy way to, say, only watch the fourth quarter; or switch from the first quarter to the third quarter. There is only one choice: play the game in its entirety, and if you want to skip ahead, use the fast forward on your remote at your peril.

Minor quibbles aside, though, this is a must-own for Spartan fans. The picture and sound quality is good and the game is fantastic. And as a bonus feature, you get the complete trophy presentation, which is a nice (if still rather bare-bones) touch.

So for my fellow citizens of Spartan Nation, I advise you to purchase this DVD now and re-live the glory of January 1, 2014. This production may not be exactly what we hoped for, but at least it's available.",1394064000,3,1172,4.416666666666667
6140144,5,B00H83OEKY,My mom and I both attended State and got to go to the Rose Bow together. I bought her the DVD for her birthday and she loved it! She called me Friday night to tell me it arrived and they had ordered pizza and were going to PASADENA!,1393804800,,232,3.8541666666666665
6140145,1,B00H83OEKY,"I agree with the previous reviews.  A blu-ray is needed!  I think the Spartan turnout in Pasadena is more than evidence enough of our loyal fanbase!  Give the people, not what they want, but what they deserve! GO GREEN!",1391731200,6,219,4.564102564102564

8630725,1,B00H83OEKY,"Very strange, but there is a section of the game that is missing on my copy of the DVD.  At the 6:24 mark in the third quarter it skips directly to 4:16.  :(  And I missed the return window.",1430956800,,190,3.8205128205128207
