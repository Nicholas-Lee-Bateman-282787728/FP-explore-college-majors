813179,5,6304233965,As I saw this movie in the cinema I was very surprised. When i saw Mission Impossible 1 some years ago I found it a middle-rate movie like many other  action movies. But this second part is so full of suspense and dramatic...  it's a a feast for your eyes! Tom Cruise shows his best sides and Thandie  Newton as his partner is a lovely sight! *g* Buy this DVD and enjoy the  game! You won't be disappointed!,967420800,2,407,4.17948717948718
813180,3,6304233965,"...this comes from having very different director's styles.
John Woo with his all-action blow them up, shoot 'em up scenes verses the first MI  movie which was very much like the TV series. If you want to see some  spectacular, mind-boggling stunts then this is the movie for you. I was  also curious to see how this film showcased Sydney - the city where I live.  In fact a lot of the movie was filmed around the building where I work.  Weird seeing such familiar surroundings in a blockbuster movie.
This is  one to see first on the big screen and then one to relive over and over on  the small one....",967420800,,604,4.339285714285714
813181,3,6304233965,"I tried to avoid being caught up in the hype for MI2, but was still disappointed.  The love interest seemed very out of character for the Ethan  Hunt we saw in the original MI, and left me somewhat cold.  The amount of  face changing going on made me think the movie should have been Face/Off 2,  not MI2.  And Woo's directing trademarks had a habit of distracting me from  the movie, leaving me thinking 'oh yes, another Woo set piece'.  For me the  movie was a great disappointment, but I'm sure many people will love it.",967161600,2,523,4.364583333333333
813182,5,6304233965,"If you like action, don't pass on this DVD.  It is a must for all Tom Cruise fans. Thandie Newton (Nyah) and Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose) really  added to the excitment,action and suspense. Tom Cruise is great and the  romantic triangle between Eathen Hunt, Nyah & Sean Ambrose was worth 6  trips to see the film.",967075200,,313,4.535714285714286
813183,2,6304233965,This is a example of how special effects has been taking over films rather than acting. Don't get me wrong i love big budget action scenes but it  helps to have a plot. Its clear that the plot has been written to fit  around the action sequences not vice versa. Lets hope there is no M:I3,965952000,,288,4.125

813487,1,6304233965,"Let me just say I LOVE the MI movies, they are nearly my all time favorites. This installment however was terrible. They kept showing close ups of some chic moping around, I don't even remember it all but it wasn't nearly as good as the others. Maybe because JJ Abrams took over? I don't know,  I'd recommend watching it  because its part of the series but realize that part 3 on ward it gets good again.",1514592000,,404,4.302631578947368

813492,2,6304233965,"My husband and I have been on a Tom Cruise kick for the last few months and have watched a lot of his movies. This one was not one of his many good movies.

First off the story was awful! Over dramatic love story in which ""His girl"" is morally forced to have sex with her ex-boyfriend, who is an underlying sex addict in order to trick him into trusting her, for the mission. Of course, Tom Cruise is ok with this, because there is NO OTHER WAY. Completely over done fight scenes, chase scenes, explosions, and gun fights, that last forever. It's mostly ridiculousness throughout the movie.

My husband even says to me the next day after watching the movie, ""I'm really disappointed in that movie because Tom Cruise has so many good movies, they dropped the ball on this one."" The disappointed lingered to the next day, that's how bad the movie was!

The only cool scene was the rock climbing part, and that is controversial since it was so dangerous that it was ridiculous.

Say your money and time and watch MI5, it was wayyyy better.",1504137600,2,1036,4.465608465608466

813896,2,6304233965,"A generous serving of cheese, sometimes hard to see because the story gets lost in all of the stylistic John Woo cinematography. Tom Cruise does a fine job as the indestructible hero, although it seems that by the end of the film he's trying a little to hard to channel ""Neo"" from the Matrix, including outfit, armaments, leather coat and sunglasses (and even a midair flying air attack with the bad guy ala Neo.) It's a fine film if you want to turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy the silliness of rock-climbing sequences without ropes, masks being used by characters that look undeniably just like the real person including facial movements (and sweat!) and grueling fight sequences that leave the hero looking a little dusty with a slight bruise or two.",1483488000,,766,4.681481481481481

814252,1,6304233965,"I watched these movies growing up, and I remember them being super cool, so I started re-watching them after Rogue Nation came out. The first one is super dated, obviously, but still cool. It had enough suspense and story and action to make you keep watching it, even when a floppy-disk was being used at a pivotal moment. This one, on the other hand, was so bad, that I laughed many times out loud. There was the most unnecessary use of slow-motion, the most epically bland dialogue, and the most predictable storyline, I was ashamed at Tom Cruise for being a part of it.  Wait, I take back the part about predictable, because nothing in a million years could have prepared me to see Ethan Hunt jousting with the bad guy on a motorcycle. The slow-mo visual of them speeding toward each other, only to jump off of their bikes and collide bodies in mid-air before falling off a cliff: priceless.
A word of advice: Netflix has 1 and 3 for a reason, if you're watching through them, just skip this one! But if you go ahead and watch this one, do it late at night, or slightly drunk, or however you like to watch comedies. It'll make it more worthwhile.",1468454400,2,1149,4.4454976303317535

814525,4,6304233965,"Well, I just reviewed the first one, so you had to know the second one was sure to follow. That is the draw of these films, every one likes them for different reasons, and as soon as you watch one, you want to see them all. Despite the old line about sequels, personally, I liked this one a lot better than the first. The story line was much closer to what I expected to see from this franchise, and this time, John Woo was Directing. I generally don't care for his writing, but when it comes to Directing action films, he's one of the best. In the second installment of Mission: Impossible, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is after a former agent, but not quite sure about what he's planning to do. As he follows the trail, Ethan learns the man has developed a deadly virus, and Ethan's mission, should he choose to accept it, is to save the day. Tom Cruise is his usual self and the action sequences are textbook John Woo, so why is this rated 3 1/2 stars you may ask? The answer is the storyline, because in a film like this, where it's all about special effects and hot bodies, the only thing that makes it different from a million other pictures is the story, and this one hits the nail on the head.",1454284800,,1196,4.25

Stepping away from the M.I.F as he'd intended is not as easy as he thought as he is offered a choice - Your Mission
Should You Choose To Accept It -
This time 'Ethan' (Tom Cruise) partnered by 'Nyah Hall' (Thandie Newton) a master-thief who's skills he'll need they
are on the trail of a rogue agent 'Sean Ambrose' (Dougary Scott) who has acquired a deadly virus stolen from a bio-
chemist. a fact that 'Ethan' is yet to learn of, if the virus falls into the wrong hands it could have deadly consequences
for an unsuspecting World.......failure on the mission is not an option.
Again 'Ethan' is ably assisted by computer and technical whiz 'Luther Stickell' (Ving Rhames)
This again a suspense filled roller-coaster-ride with some superb action sequences and jaw-dropping stunts, 'Cruise'
quite simply electric in the role of special-agent 'Ethan Hunt' along with a suitably credible villain role for 'Dougary
Scott) also among the cast list 'Anthony Hopkins' as mission-commander 'Swanbeck'
Another very entertaining instalment in the Mission Impossible Movie-Series,

814995,3,6304233965,"Mission Impossible team recruit thief given her connection to a guy who is trying to buy a germ to infect the world with.

I wouldn't really say t hat this was a MI movie. It didn't look/feel like one. There were all of these slow motion scenes. It was more of a romantic/action adventure type of a movie, not a action adventure movie. Still it didn't have the espionage/cloak/dagger feel to it. I mean there were a few ""tricks"" for sure . . . especially with those masks that the MI team uses. But overall the focus seems to be on the lead actress/character. It was as if someone somewhere thinks she is the idea of female beauty. So we see her being fawned over, catered too. She is striking poses that supposedly are sultry etc. So that was the focus of the movie. I thought it was all silly. And I don't think she is the idea of beauty.

Anyway there is also the return of the long haired Tom Cruise. He was so all American looking in MI I. So cute and thin/healthy looking. Then here he starts that long hair thing. Flipping it around. Looks goofy. He also had a rather stoic performance in this one. Some lines were delivered in a rather deliberate way instead of an acting way. Again it was almost like the filming/producing was bad. There were the silly fight/chase scenes. Too impossible even for MI. And you can see the guy just stand there anticipating the hit before he falls down. Just goofy.

And there was the lead villain guy who either looked or was made to look like a serpent with metal teeth. Just odd. And distracting.",1440547200,,1539,4.374125874125874

814998,2,6304233965,"MI2 like the first movie was not very good all the way around.  You really have to expand your suspension of disbelieve a long way in this movie especially when they are crashing and diving off motorcycles without any injuries whatsoever.

At times in this film I kept thinking about a movie like Tropic Thunder where a guy gets shot 50 times and is still breathing and talking like its a flesh wound.  That film is hilarious and does not take itself seriously at all. Whereas in this film the hero just dusts himself off after a big crash and starts running at full speed without the slightest hint of damage just like Superman.

In this action movie I just don't buy a lot of the action scenes, they seemed to impossible.  Maybe I am bias towards 007 and the James Bond films and prefer those types of movies over the Mission Impossible series.  I just did not care at all for this movie.  Penelope Cruz acting was like watching paint dry, even if she is easy on the eyes she offered almost nothing to the movie.

I enjoy lots of Tom Cruises movies and he was definitely in great shape for this role and all the other MI movies.  I just did not care about the story, the villain or any of the agents. On the plus side I did like the movie soundtrack with Limb Bizkit and Metallica it was not bad but did not care for the movie.
I think this is the weakest installment to the MI franchise and would pick one another sequel instead.",1440028800,,1432,4.29368029739777

If it seemed to suffer a little in it's continuity in Woo's first cut it was 3 1/2 hours and the studio said no, try about 120 minutes instead.  So things had to go until they got down to an expectable time.  The filming ran long and Dougray Scott lost out on the role of Wolverine because of it.  Hugh Jackman has been happy.  Scott is an exceptional actor and his role as Sean Ambrose a villain out to lose a new virus on the world is excellent.  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and crew and love interest Thandie Newton have to stop him from releasing ""Chimera"".  Plenty of action and a big car chase on a road on a mountain side provide thrills.

There's an over-abundance of slow motion (even the regular motion feels S-L-O-W...) and everything is just cheesy and fake and charmless. (Yes, even Tom Cruise manages to be charmless. Now that's acting!!!) The amazing Ving Rhames is horribly under-utilized (does he even get 10 lines?) and the whole thing is just a stinker. The only redeeming thing about the movie is the beautiful Thandie Newton, everything else is bunk, atrocious bunk. It's not even entertaining in a ""nothing else to do, I'll watch some stuff explode, and Tom Cruise isn't that bad"" kind of way. Go re-watch almost any other action flick several times (in a row) before sitting through this sorry excuse for a movie. I can't think of one scene, one line, or even one stunt worth seeing.

On an Amazon-related note, this movie didn't load, glitched out, froze, and we never did get to watch it on Prime Instant Video, which is too bad...I was looking forward to writing a detailed piece on Mindless Drivel and the lack of intelligent spy/action movies.

I'd put on my Cold Gear top, frown at my inner tube-like midsection, and suck my breath in to look at little more impressive, then go meet my friends and play. I more or less looked the part, but on closer inspection, you'd be able to tell that I was out of shape, struggling to maintain my performance.

I'd describe this movie in the same way. Overall, it looks pretty decent, well-polished, put together. But the more you scrutinize it, from the silly fight scenes to the impossible science (which, despite its name, is not the impression this movie should try to achieve by any means), to the ineffectual antagonist (no real sense of menace, just a spoiled brat of a boy), the more you realize it doesn't hold up as a legitimate sci-fi action/thriller, especially when compared to the humbler, more serious and ostensibly more realistic prequel.

THAT SAID... as long as your goal is not to scrutinize the movie, it's still enjoyable. So I give it 3 out of 5. It won't leave you with a heartfelt impact, but there are far worse movies you could waste your time with.",1411344000,,1242,4.515555555555555

816850,1,6304233965,"It's hard to describe just how bad this movie is, but I'll try to give it a crack.

The problem with MI 2 is that it does not live up to the series trademark to deliver an entertaining thrill ride similar to the Bond films. Ironically, there are plenty of death defying stunts and cool actions sequences that should have been amazing. But they are not, they're very dull and lack merit.

All right let's get this party started:

1.) The movie is poorly edited. I read on IMDB that they had to replace the editor who was going to work on this film because he got into an accident. Well, they clearly didn't spend enough time finding a suitable replacement, because the edits in this film are terrible.

Jump cuts, terrible pacing, and amateur takes that should have never made it into a blockbuster film like this.

Examples: When Tom Cruise finally kills the villain and shoots him, the villain's body is already collapsing from the bullet wound. You never actually see him get shot, but the way he's falling looks so cheesy and corny that it was cringe worthy to watch.

The climactic scene where the villain is about to get the virus uses one of Hans Zimmers most beautiful songs: Injection

AND TOTALLY FAILS to deliver a satisfying action sequence. It was weak, empty, useless, and had zero emotion. The music did not belong with that scene and it shows. Just thinking about what a failure that scene was makes me angry.

2.) The characters are dull, boring, and unrealistic in a not so fun way. The villain is the absolute worst. This was some of the worst acting I've seen in a film and the motivations and dialogues of the characters didn't help matters. The supporting characters for Tom Cruise were under utilized and given bit parts that weren't very funny at all.

Also, very annoying is how quickly Tom Cruise's character Ethan instantly falls in love with the ""bond girl"" at the start of the movie. No date, no life-saving interaction, no build up to why they should care about each other. It's simply ""You girl, me man, I love you.""

When Bond gets a girl, it's usually just a fling or to get information. But Ethan genuinely fell in love with this woman without any precedent! This movie is two hours long, the least they could have done is thrown in some character development.

3.) Action sequences felt forced and unnecessary. Perfect example is when Ethan is trying to recruit the bond girl for his mission. She says, ""If you want me, you'll have to catch me."" And for no reason we have a car chase over winding streets on a mountain road.

Look, I love action, but it has to have a purpose. It can't just be action for the sake of action, otherwise it's boring.

Rather than go on and on about how bad this movie is, let me just end my review with this.

The other Mission Impossible movies are way better than this one. Skip MI2.",1397433600,,2850,4.498062015503876

817063,5,6304233965,"When you eat escargot, you don't say ""Eeew, too much butter.""  Escargot are: snails in butter.

When you watch cartoons, and Road Runner stays in the air for several seconds before falling, you don't say ""That is an unrealistic representation of how the force of gravity acts upon falling bodies ... unless, perhaps there was an updraft against the canyon wall.""

And when you watch a movie with Tom Cruise, neither should you expect lowfat escargot, or strict adherence to laws of physics.  Ain't happenin'.

The producers of Mission Impossible appear to have decided to take the gentle, wry and thoughtful concepts of the original mid-60's TV series with clever characters who outwitted their nefarious opponents and apply some millennial bling.  Elements such as the iconic self-destructing tape recorder, lifelike face-masks, and musical score were retained and enhanced.  The rest was replaced with Tom Cruise and a remarkably hot actress, as well as some ... more modern ... special effects.

(Watching a movie made in 2000 in 2014 should convince you that technology has indeed advanced; back in 2000, digital cameras having any remotely useful photographic qualities cost ten's of thousands of dollars and were years away from being a common item.  This in this movie, digital cameras are featured as a prominent high-tech gadget.  Of course we now all carry far more sophisticated cameras along with our pocket sized computers, phones, internet connections and movie screens.  And we no longer make special effort to emphasize the digital aspects of the cameras, as was necessary in this film.)

Indeed, one must assume a certain artistic license taken by producers who indeed decided to put the action into the action film M:I-2 was very much billed as.  And action we got, from the very opening scene.  There were several moments of calm and quiet during the obligatory and tastefully edited sex scene.  Otherwise, it was action.  And lifelike face-masks (whose technology, naturally, has become far more versatile and ubiquitous in these decades since the 60's.)

The action was truly impressive.  Our hero was truly heroic -- quoting Wikipedia ""in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage and the will for self sacrifice ... for some greater good of all humanity.""  While Wikipedia doesn't specifically mention motorcycle or aerial skills, or remarkable marksmanship, these characteristics shown by the M:I-2 hero are without doubt close to the original definition, again quoting Wikipedia, referring to ""martial courage or excellence"".

So if it surprises you that it would be possible to take an accurate shot using a handgun at long distance, while spinning on the front wheel of a dirt bike after a hard brake and multiple minutes of physically exhausting fights before, perhaps you're failing to understand the idea of heroism, mythology, or action films with Tom Cruise.  I am guessing the other critics here also found movies like Avatar or perhaps Alien unrealistic.  Both were incredible movies, also with incredibly hot actresses (although admittedly in these latter cases, the actresses had the lead).  Enough said on that point.

I encourage you to come into the experience of M:I-2 with expectations set appropriately.  Be prepared to suspend your disbelief (be very prepared).  Under these conditions, you will not be disappointed.",1393632000,,3399,5.213627992633517

It comes in the form of a deadly virus which has fallen into the wrong hands and that the government doesn't want breaking into the general population by way of criminals and terrorists who may buy it on the black market. I think. Okay, I'm going to admit that I didn't pay a whole hell of a lot of attention to the plot in this one because it was thin on the ground. The reviews told me so beforehand but I was like ""it can't be that bad! I mean, this is a Mission Impossible movie!"" but the reviews were right. It's okay, though, because the plot is not the big payoff in this flick, the action is. It's John Woo, people!

But then comes the mission because he needs to SAVE THE WORLD. Helping him save the world this time is a thief named Nyah who is played by the always alluring Thandie Newton. Also, helping Ethan is Ving Rhames' character who I was so happy to see make a reappearance! Once all of the players are on the scene there is action action suspense suspense action action action!!!

The last 20 minutes of the movie ruined it. Let's just say that when Ethan Hunt is throwing more flying kicks than NEO in the Matrix then there is a problem.

Many seem to prefer the convoluted slow paced bore-fest of the first movie, or perhaps they liked the cerebral psychological thriller of the third.  Or maybe they prefer to see Tom Cruise looking effing ridiculous alongside hawkeye wearing a hoodie.

A movie should be judged on it's own merits, not as a comparison to some other source material, and the audience simply refuses to set aside bias and enjoy MI2 for what it is; a terrificly compelling action movie.

Particularly great sequences involving Thandie Newton (Nyah) and a gritty yet stylistic endgame fight set to solely percussion make it memorable, and not forgettable despite what other reviews might say.  If action, explosions, heroics do not interest you in a movie, no one is forcing you at gunpoint to watch and then write a half-intelligent review of MI2.

In the process of executing their plan, they run up against Ethan Hunt and his ensemble cast of agents.  As the two sides fight of against each other, we see cool gadgets being used, surreal gunfights that result in minimal bloodshed, knockout fistfights that leave no bruises and affects no hairlines, and of course the gorgeous babe that used to the bad guy's girl but who switches allegiance to the good guys.  Sounds like the typical James Bond film.  Now that we have that comparison out of the way, we can try and judge the movie on its merits.  The acting was typical of a Tom Cruise movie; believable but not great.  The dialogue was realistic but not captivating.  The special effects were good, but not mesmerizing.

But the problem is ridiculous stunt followed by ridiculous stunt followed by explosions that don't make any sense followed by ridiculous stunt end up becoming boring.  I swear the most exciting part was the beginning where TC was climbing.  Just because it was different.  I've seen where a semi crashes into an SUV sideways and the SUV blows up completely because it's a stunt.  I've seen where people do impossible things with vehicles and things blow up for no reason.  But at least the climbing was different.  How many times can a person watch something blow up that should not blow up? And then getting shot at with the fake sparking and bullets completely around TC but of course he isn't hit.  That's pretty old too.

I mean, I didn't have high expectations based on the genre, casting, etc., but this wasn't even coherent. The editing was awful - they could've shortened the movie to 90 minutes by cutting down on the footage of the ocean that was interspersed with the final hand-combat scene (seriously, it was hero, villain, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, hero, crashing ocean, villain, crashing ocean, hero, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, villain, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, hero, villain, hero, villain, crashing ocean...I know this seems like I'm just being dramatic, but I'm not).

The story went from being thin to ignored to irrelevant and then, when they tried to pick it up again after the -seriously, no lie- 15 minute final hand-combat scene, I'd forgotten most of it and no longer cared.

This movie was so terrible that I regret the rental expense; think about it, I watched with one other person which makes the investment less than a couple of dollars each and it was still 10x more than the movie was worth.

If you're interested in action movies, MI:3 and MI:4 were both considerably better movies (still pretty crazy, but at least done well, engaging, semi-logical). Save your money and see one of those instead. If you've already seen them, see them again...or watch the TV screen when it's powered off...or stare at a wall...clean the grout in the neighbor's guest bathroom...go to the library...do anything else, but don't bother with this movie.",1335052800,,1586,5.088461538461538

To the plot, to the way the scenes ebb and flow, to the style, to the way the whole film is put together whereby the sum is greater than the parts.  You must understand that John Woo is enamoured with old-fashioned Hollywood, and is Chinese, so honor and love and good versus evil really matter.  Hence, the ""corny"" dialogue, and the doves and the fire and the crashing waves symbolizing the monumental battle between good and evil.  If you appreciate old-fashioned movie making, where the good guys are good (albeit flawed - they make mistakes too) and the bad guys are bad, then you will appreciate this M:I film in particular.  Yes, the action scenes are great, but so are the characters, and so believeable are they.  The bonus: the bad guy is a really good, obsessed bad guy.

There is no denying that original 96 film is, BY FAR, the best in the series, but Woo's follow up is very engaging in its stark differences.

Instead of playing a head game on us this time, Woo takes Hunt and his escapades in a drastically different direction.  Woo, who is well known for his unique brand of action films, makes an impressionable mark on this film, layering scene after scene with his visionary stylings and delivering a stunning array of action sequences that ooze forth with eye-catching symmetry.  The plot becomes an afterthought (unlike the original, which was all about plot).  It has been commented that this film was basically built around the action scenes, and it shows, but that is the beauty of what Woo did here.

The original film was engaging and spellbinding because it made you think (hard), but this film is equally as engaging and spellbinding for the opposite reason, it makes you stare (hard).

The film revolves around Hunt and a thief Nyah who fall in love after getting steamy only to have their affections tested when they join forces to smoke out Sean, Nyah's ex-lover who happens to be selling off a deadly virus.  Things get sticky (as always) and Hunt has to fight his way out, and fight he does.

With countless action scenes that involve a freelance climb up the side of a mountain that still gives me chills; one of the best car chase scenes in movie history; a brilliant ending battle between Cruise and Scott (complete with motorcycles) and a slew of other expertly crafted espionage stuff, `Mission Impossible: 2' is totally absorbing.

Tom Cruise, as much as I dislike him, was a perfect fit for this film, and he carried that perfect fit through all three films.  His arrogance is balanced beautifully with his dedication, and the layers of humanity given him here (no matter how forced at times) play off him nicely.  Dougray Scott makes the perfect villain and I hate that he has pretty much disappeared.  After his stint in `Ever After' I saw `heartthrob' written all over him, and then he did this and I saw versatility and really thought he would be everywhere.  Sadly, he kind of just went away.  Thandie Newton hasn't gone anywhere, and I'm happy about that.  She is totally hit or miss for me, but when she hits (like she does here), she is unforgettable.

So, is this as good as DePalma's near masterpiece?  No, but it's a totally different film and it compliments the original.  I own all three, and like them all to varying degrees (I feel like the third film tried hard to mix the plot depth of the original with the action style of Woo's to uneven effect, but Hoffman is seethingly brilliant and reason enough to see the film).",1266969600,2,2958,4.621414913957935

All I care about is what happens when I put it in the machine and sit down to watch.  For me, that's the first time, and the movie is New and Original.  And all I can say is, Tom Cruise is very, very good at what he does, and the world knows it.

Woo's direction is excellent, with a good deal of that HongKong dazzle we've all come to love.  Fine by me.  When I watach escapist flicks I don't expect realism, and don't really want it.  But, I thik that what makes MI-2 as watchable as it is, is Cruise's persona; not his personality, but the clever use of his unusual and still unusually handsome face, coupled with his relatively small, wiry  body.  I think it was Salinger who said that actors were best served by havin small or relatively small bodies.  It lends their movement -- particularly acrobatic or athletic movement -- an extra sense of spacial excitement.  Big action actors like Schwartzenekker don't have that extra physical excitement, thogh they're as agile and move as well, simply because they're so big.  Size makes them look slower.  (Watch Donald O'Connor dance beside Gene Kelly.  Kelly's good but Donald's flying!)  In this film Cruise's stunts, like his high jumping or slithering down cables have an ariel circus kind of excitement.  Personally, the opening mountain-climbing sequence filmed out in the Arizona high sandstone formations, hooked me.  An acrophobic with a keen fear of heights, bare-handed climbing, alone, drives me wild, and when he slipped, or appeared to slip and fall maybe 20 or 30 feet down the face of the cliff, I let out a yell.

As for the rest of it, trick driving and particularly trick motorcycle stunt driving; I bought it.  I love bike riding, thogh I never do any trick riding, and these sequences, like those in MATRIX RELOADED were thrilling.

Leading Lady?  Thandie Newton (as ""the Girl"") did what she was supposed to do: she made Tom look great; ie., sexy and desireable.  But, Newton?  She was far more interesting and had more to do in RIDDIK, and made Karl Urban sexy by appearing to be attracted to him.  Action Heroes require particulr kinds of actresses, and more often than not they must be exotic in some way.  One remembers Rae Dawn Chong paired with Arnold, and of Grace Jones with Schwartzenekker, again, as Konan, and then playing beside Roger Moore's James Bond in VIEW TO A KILL.  The idea seems to be, the greater the contrast between them, the greater and more exciting will the attraction appear.  What happen to these actresses?  Diesel's uber-heisse Bohemian squeeze in XXX; what ever happened to her?

Negative:  Waste of Ving Rhames.  Great face/head; great voice, but where was he?  Miscast as a computer geek locked up in a van.

More selling points?  The bad guys are convincing and well-played.  The gadgets are as good as the WMD bacillus of the story.  Plus, or make that a double-plus, the music is good and the sound is GREAT!  Gives my Home Theatre set-up a workout.

All I can say is, its a hell of a lot of fun!",1229817600,,3179,4.639138240574506
819368,4,6304233965,"I just got this disc after watching it years ago in its worldwide premiere.  I wanted to see what I liked about it and the film holds up remarkably well.

MI-2 features the creative and extravagant pairing of Tom Cruise and John Woo (more explosions! more cars!). Their signature presence is evident in every shot.  Robert Towne's script, though no doubt rewritten, is actually tight with strong dialogue and a solid plot.  In short, the film works well on all fronts.  It doesn't force viewers to think or understand what the problem is - it just gets on with it, unlike many movies that try too hard to be cerebral and clever.  People clamouring for the original Brian DePalma Mission Impossible film (which I found convoluted) will never like the subsequent MI-2 and 3 efforts which veered more into James Bond action popcorn territory.

Considering Woo's mixed experiences in Hollywood, MI-2 is actually one of his most polished efforts.  In spite of a couple of schticky moments which many people find justifiably hokey (I just had to watch the Audi-Porsche car spinning sequence again) - the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously WHICH IS THE POINT. Critics of Tom Cruise and John Woo will never fully enjoy the film, because of Cruise's cheeseball grin, and Woo's stylistic quirks.  But put away those issues, and excuse the signature doves flying around, and you have a thrill-a-minute film.

The casting of Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott makes the film even more intriguing, and puts MI-2 above many other films of this genre that almost reach for this but never make it.  As an action film, this has some amazing shots that deserve kudos.

The DVD extras are extensive and a good primer for anyone interested in how to do an action film. There are good interviews with the director and stunt supervisors.  There's also a hilarious mockumentary with Ben Stiller from the MTV Movie Awards spoofing Tom Cruise as ""Tom Crooze.""

MI-2 is underrated.  Watch it and enjoy it.  If you need a heavy down-to-earth thriller - heck, Mission Impossible was never about that if you recall the premise of ""this message will self-destruct in 5 seconds..."" It's meant to be fun.",1224892800,2,2181,4.82258064516129
819369,4,6304233965,"Let me say, the trailer was good. Wetted my appetite for the real deal...  Sorry to say that the film was cliche, the fight scenes could have been improved (should have hired Woo Ping Yuen as the martial arts director), the editing was not sharp enough to backup the action. Some of the scenes like on the bike was so unrealistic that the Hong Kong audience found it unrealistic (after being brought up on unrealistic martial arts film in HK, I would have thought we could have accepted this)...  The MI team is supposed to be a hi-tech team with lots of gadgetry like in MI part 1, but in MI2, we don't see much of this.  This is another run of the mill action film. John Woo's direction was disappointing, laboured over some of his trademarks such as the slow motion cam, plus the doves. The damn dove and the damn pigeons!  There are some good new tricks (like shooting backwards on the bike by looking at the rear view mirror), but the emphasis was not there. It didn't look as cool as it should have. I can't put my finger on the thing that ruined the film... but it definitely could have been much much better.  Gladiator is a better bet for the summer's action...",1222819200,,1170,4.373271889400922
819370,3,6304233965,"This movie is a perfect example of an over blown, over the top, over budget sequel. When will Hollywood learn that bigger explosions and bigger budget doesn't make a better sequel, that's why most sequels fail to be even loyal to the first. That is exactly what happens here. Director John Woo, best known for his fascinating heroic bloodshed movies (The Killer, a better tomorrow, face/off)tries to brings his wonders to this flick. Unfortunately he fails to bring them in right to this sequel. The problem here is that it lacks the goodies of the first. The main issue is the mood; it is completely different from the first film. Whereas The first M:I had a nice blend of espionage and action, this one is an exaggerated/story less sequel. It felt more like a bad James Bond movie then it felt like a good spy movie.

The movie's thin plot surrounds upon a man made lethal virus, deadly enough to kill someone in 48 hours. The plan is to release the virus and then make money from selling the antidote how original.. Right? The rest is Tom Cruise doing crazy stunts, and exaggerating his persona. Now the movie does have a lot of good action sequences that's for sure, and it sounds and looks nice on screen and john woo is known for that, known for making action look like poetry. But it doesn't do  justice to the movie, it only makes it exaggerating; just because the action may look cool doesn't mean it will make a movie good, you need story also, which I felt was missing here. And the story they chose was bland and soulless. The fact  is that this movie is a Tom Cruise vehicle rather than a team work espionage. It doesn't have the chemistry of the TV series nor of the first movie. Definitely rent before buying, unless you're an avid fan of the franchise.

819482,1,6304233965,"Okay, so De Palma's film wasn't Citizen Kane, but at least it had its moments when Cruise's insatiable vanity was kept in check in favour of some well-executed set-pieces (even if one was stolen lock, stock and barrel from Topkapi). Woo's disastrous sequel - at the time the most expensive film ever made - is like an endless hairspray commercial, with the ever limited Cruise (who used to be able to act but now just runs off a checklist of six annoying expressions) constantly flicking his hair in glowing slo-mo - you keep on expecting him to say 'Because I'm worth it.' Unfortunately, they're so busy making him look pretty that they forget to include any of the basics of a Summer movie. The action scenes are few and far between and not worth the wait; the script is another lazy and lifeless stinker from Robert Towne that rivals his Love Affair for banal inconsequentiality; and the Brits in the cast let the side down even more than Woo, Cruise and Towne combined - Thandie Newton seems semi-comatose, Hopkins hams it up and cashes the cheque, while Dougray Scott demonstrates just how dull an actor he can be even when mugging relentlessly. The only good thing that came of this film was the over-runs keeping Scott from playing Wolverine in X-Men: judging from his subsequent performances on screen and stage, if being boring on screen was an Olympic sport, this guy would win Scotland gold every time.

819484,4,6304233965,"I remember when this film was first released.  I didn't get a chance to see this film in theaters nor did I really care to.  I had seen the first M:I, and although I thought it was a fairly decent film, I didn't think it was anything to brag about.  When I saw previews for M:I-2, it really had me at confusion.  The film didn't seem to resemble anything of the first film.  While the first one was more targeted towards adults, this one was clearly aiming for a younger audience.  Naturally, I thought this movie was going to be dumb and that is exactly what I thought when I finally saw it.  I was 13 yrs old, I really did not understand anything that was going on-just something about a disease and all the action scenes that were already overplayed in the tons of commercials I saw for the movie.  After I saw it, I told everybody from that point on to ignore this one.

That was back in 2001.  Its 2007 and I am now 19 yrs old.  M:I-3 has now been made which I thought was an incredibly awesome movie.  Not that long ago one of my friends and I were having a conversation about all sorts of movies.  We just happened to come accross this one.  I told him how M:I and M:I-3 were really good, and M:I-2 was bad.  He on the other hand admitted that he actually liked the 2nd one.  Seeing is how it was yrs since I saw M:I-2, I didn't really remember much except what I mentioned above.  So I started checking up on it again.  I saw the trailer on youtube and to my surprise, it looked pretty good.  Not long afterwards, the movie came on TNT.  Obviousely I watched and surprisingly enough, I enjoyed Very Much!!  While it does not live up to M:I-3, it definetly earned a spot on my favorite movies list.  Here's the plot.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action when a fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Douggray Scott) has gone rogue.  Ambrose has stolen a deadly biologically engineered virus known as Chimera, a virus that kills your red blood cells if infected.  There is a cure called Valeraphon which can only save a persons if treated within 20 years.  However, after 20 hours, nothing can save.  Hunt with the help a thief, Nyah Nordaf Hall (Thandie Newton) they must infiltrate and find out what Ambrose's plans are for the virus.  Hunt must also at the same time dig deeper into discovering the truth about why this disease was created in the first place.

That basically says it.  Just to add a few more things, although I actually like this movie now, I stil believe its the weakest of the M:I's.  It surprises me very much that of all of them, this was grossed the most money.  I think the real problem with this film is the very fact that it tries too hard to be ""cool"".  First lets start off with the ridiculous concepts- Tom Cruise rock climbing with no gear except powder for his hands, his mission being assigned through sunglasses, the car chase with Thandie Newton (there was no suspense and the characters appear to be having fun).  Then theres the action scenes.  I know John Woo has his style but I think it was a bit overdone.  Too many quick cuts and overuse of explosions.  Then theres all the rock music in the film, I do not think that was necessary.  And then there's Tom Cruise's look with the long wavy hair.  I really think his hair was like that to make this movie seem ""cool"".  I am sure the original M""I series would never have had these elements.  I really think this film would have been alot better if it were its own movie rather than an M:I.  Well anyway, I still suggest.  But if anyone has a chance, definetly check out M:I-3.

819485,2,6304233965,"As others have mentioned, there was no Mission Impossible Team, except for Ving Rhames, and Anthony Hopkins, the boss, (Interesting, we got to see the face that goes with the voice on the tape that introduces the case.)

819486,2,6304233965,I was watching this on TV recently after having seen it only once before when it first came out and it dawned on me that it has the same basic storyline as Hitchcock's Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman (1946). But the result is vastly different.  Notorious doesn't rely on high-tech props or unbelievable stunts - just pure good acting and suspense like only Hitchcock can do it.,1180915200,2,390,4.6521739130434785
819487,3,6304233965,"I think it took me two seeing to realize how yucky this movie was; there was so much that was wrong. I think the first thing that we notice is that this is not about the Impossible Mission Force, but Tom Cruise.  So, aside form the name, the music, and the jargon, this has nothing to do with the classic show.

This was a let-down.  Leonard Nemoy in ""I Am Spock"" mentioned that he loved the teamwork aspect of the series.  I agree: there was something about Mr. Phelps and the IMF all piling into the getaway van and the classic Mission: Impossible recessional theme that let you know that there was a job well done because each member did his part.  Like the guy said, ""The greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concerted effort, never attended individual exertion or enterprise.""

Another problem was the physics.  The cycle-jousting forgets that when two objects traveling at 50 mph a piece collide, the cumulative force felt by them is not 50, but 100 mph.  Talk about being jelly!  And the gun in the sand: how does kicking it forward make it go one and half meters vertically into the air?

This film has plot, in the sense of having action, or a series of events.  But did I mention the plot holes?  How did Cruise happen to have a Richard Roxburgh mask so handy? I guess it was next to the handy duct tape.  And how did they change clothes so quickly?

Yes, there is conflict: Cruise versus the Aussie, and Cruise versus the supermodel supertheif. The theme is not so obvious. There are messages about courage, duty, and self sacrifice. These are helpful, but seem to be mere distracting tinsel.

Being John Woo, this film is essentially about style. This is good for artists who have plot, theme, and characterization, and would like to perfect their craft.  As a standalone attribute, however, this film leaves something to be desired. Anyone who has been on a date knows that looks only go so far.  And the same applies to movies.

A true feast for the eyes of those who just want to have a good fun over 126 min. The film owns a frenetic rhythm, but there is something weak in the script that simply worries us since the first minutes.

John Woo made a flamboyant and challenging picture, that asks our total indulgence with hard to believe acrobatic sequences over a motorcycle. But the script ( the vertebral column of any single movie) does not resist a serious analysis, and that's a real shame, because all the cast was effective and although there are many hair raising sequences, you leave the hall with a sensation of emptiness, as you had eaten three  hamburgers in rigorous tandem. It' s far to be the same, to eat like a Viking than feed oneself like a gourmet.

Cruise is special effective and his personage is even much more human respect his previous entry. Ving Rhames is splendid in his hard to die role, but I found Tandy Newton a mite cold and inexpressive in her role.

Now, I am of the opinion that a movie's first and foremost job is to entertain -- not to enlighten, not to inform, not to make us feel more intellectual because we have plowed the shadowy depths of a film's varied and multi-layered philisophical underpinnings. If a movie fails to entertain, then it has failed utterly. I don't care how successful it is on any other front.

MI2 is a very entertaining movie. You can't take your eyes off of it. The action is completely engaging and there's just enough plot and dialogue in between. I know, I know; you guys all want to look cool and agree with the rest of the sheeple, er, filmgoers by dismissing this flick as mere fluff, but if you're looking for any sort of depth from this sort of fare, what in tarnation were you thinking???

Tom Cruise stars in, while John Woo directs a lackluster sequel, to the original ""Mission"", that has so many outlandish action sequences it's almost too cartoonish to watch.

Taking place a few years after ""Mission: Impossible"", ""M:I 2"" has a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose, stealing the vaccine to a highly deadly genetic enhanced virus that can infect the world's popluation within a week of it's release.

The IMF assigns Ethan Hunt to the mission. Ambrose disguises himself as Hunt early on in the film, to steal the vaccine from it's creator, making Hunt itching for some payback, & at first, making the IMF question Hunt's loyalties.

Ethan must first, contact & hook up with Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a thief & former lover of Ambrose's. Second, Ethan has to not only retrieve the vaccine, but, also must get to the virus before Ambrose does. Easier said than done, after all this is ""Mission: Impossible"".

""M:I 2"" is easily the weakest of three ""M:I"" movies. Although, the plot is pretty solid, their are some holes. The big one for me, was at the end of the film when Nyah is infected. Her symptoms are nowhere near as bad as the scientist at the beginning of the film. She's concious, there is no blood loss, & she just seems to be stumbling around like a drunk (yeah, she looks infected to me & I totally f**king bought it).

This is Tom Cruise's vanity project. I know between takes somebody had a mirror in front of him, making sure somebody loved him.

Dougray Scott was originally offered the role of Wolverine in ""The X-Men"", but, due to over shooting on this film he had no choice but to pass on the role. Enter Hugh Jackman. Snikt! Exit Dougray Scott's career.

The action is a bit much in this film & is the absolute big drawback to ""M:I 2"". A few action sequences mirror too much of past Woo films.

The motorcycle chase reminded a little bit of ""Hard Target"" & when Hunt & Ambrose do the chest bump off the motorcycle's it reminded of a similar sequence from ""Face/Off"".

""M:I 2"" is a decent film, that I expected much more out of both Tom Cruise & John Woo, & if it self destructs in five seconds, I won't lose sleep over it.",1149465600,3,2348,4.529550827423168

The action actually is really exciting and the soundtrack is a great booster to the stunts. I was also happy to learn Cruise did a vast majority of the stunts himself.

819645,3,6304233965,"Let me begin by telling you two things.  One: I really liked the 1996 film adaptation of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Two: John Woo is one of my favorite directors.  It would seem to me, and to countless others, that John Woo directing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II would be a dream come true.  Perhaps it was because of high expectations that audiences were so disappointed with Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II.

While the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was deep and jumbled enough to throw many people off, the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is so miniscule that it's nearly non-existent.  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), an IMF (Impossible Mission Force) spy, is ordered to recruit a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and work with her in a mission to destroy ""Chimera"", a genetically-modified disease that could kill millions.  Hunt and the thief, named Nyah, become romantically attached to each other, and things begin to get complicated.

One of the most interesting things about the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series is seeing how each director handles the material.  Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was filled with shady characters and conspiracies.  J.J. Abrams' MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III was an energetic, action-packed thrill ride.  John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is substantially different from each of those films.  It has nothing in common with De Palma's film at all.  It is, however, loaded with intense action sequences.  This will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with director Woo's previous films.

Indeed, there are some scenes in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II which only John Woo could pull off.  The movie is loaded with Woo's trademark slo-mo action and over-the-top stunts.  Memorable scenes include Ethan Hunt wielding dual pistols (something done by numerous other characters in legendary scenes from Woo's Chinese films) and a scene in which a lone white dove emerges from a line of flames.  As an operatic bit of Hans Zimmer's very fine score begins playing, Ethan Hunt walks past the flames, glaring in at the film's villain - who is, by the way, played by Dougray Scott.

Any movie directed by John Woo is sure to blow away most action fans, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II should really knock their socks off.  The plot is small enough to give Woo time to focus on the action scenes, while keeping the film a few steps away from mediocrity.  (Screenwriter Robert Towne has said that he based his script on action scenes which John Woo told him that he wanted to direct.)  Cruise's Hunt comes off, at times, as an American James Bond.  His performance conveys a strong sense of urgency and, occasionally, desperation, which really adds to the overall intensity of the film.

What John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II lacks in depth is made up for with perfectly-executed action sequences guaranteed to satisfy the action fan.  Despite a primarily-negative audience response, this is a good sequel that very narrowly misses the mark.",1147305600,,2931,5.05625
819646,3,6304233965,"The first movie was pretty good.  The second movie is a decent followup with more explosives, more action, and more stunts.  The only thing is that it slowed down on plot, story, and its appeal towards a mental capacity above the third grade.

A lot of people really appreciated how ""smart"" the first movie was.  Some people complained about it being a bit confusing so for the second movie they dumbed it down.  Did it work?  Well, it is hard to tell.  First of all, the second installment did make more money but won less critical and audience acclaim.  Personally, I prefer the first movie over the second.

My biggest complaint was that they tended to do the face-switching game way too much.  Every other person wasn't who he claimed to be.  In the end, they just used it as a copout whenever they couldn't further their plot without something original.",1147305600,2,858,4.6158940397351
819647,1,6304233965,"Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.

John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.

Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.

Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff. Which is also a shame.

819773,3,6304233965,"""Mission Impossible 2"" is darker and moodier than the first film in the series (there are lots of slow-motion shots and slow-burn looks of longing between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton), but it still has the clever, tense, and slam-bang elements needed for a good ""Mission Impossible"" film.  So, even if you don't like the moodiness and lush romance added to the mix, you should still enjoy the movie.

Highlights include a great mountain-climbing sequence in the beginning, a couple of exciting car chases, some signature John Woo gunplay, and a chase at the climax involving motorcycles.  Also, Thandie Newton is very pretty and a pleasure to watch throughout, giving a relaxed, engaging performance.

Alas, some quibbles:  every single time one of those peel-off masks was being used by a character to impersonate someone else, I predicted it.  They would telegraph an imminent dramatic-peel-off-the-mask moment by having the character we think we were seeing act plainly out of character for that person.  Also, Ethan Hunt's infiltration of the science lab via helicopter and cable winch was just a bigger version of the the first movie's famous CIA infiltration scene.  Finally, there's a slightly more conventional feel to the proceedings compared to Brian De Palma's edgy, unpredictable first MI adventure.

But the quibbles are just that, quibbles.  Though I ultimately liked the first film more, there's certainly enough here to enjoy if you're in the mood for a clever, pedal-to-the-metal action thriller.  Bring on Mission Impossible 3!",1145577600,,1547,5.247967479674797
819774,4,6304233965,"""MI2"" is a rarity among sequels--it's actually comparable to the first film in terms of action with better action sequences than Brian DePalma's strong first entry in this franchise. Based on the 1966 TV show (which also spawned another TV show that failed to find an audience), ""MI2"" works because of John Woo's carefully choregraphed action sequences and the action packed script by Robert Towne (writer of""Chinatown"", ""Shampoo"" -and also the awful ""Days of Thunder"")based on a story by Ron Moore & Brannon Braga who wrote ""Star Trek: First Contact""). While the character development could be stronger, the story is fairly weak but what makes this film work is the action sequences although it seems they are trying to make Hunt into more of a Bond character.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise before his public relations meltdown)must stop the bioengineered virus Chimera from being used to create a worldwide epidemic. It seems that a former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott)has intercepted the cure and is holding it for ransom. Hunt must assemble an IMF team quickly which icludes Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Billy Baird (John Polson) and a civilian Nyah (Thandie Newton)who was previously involved with Ambrose. Hunt is working with a deadline because the virus kills rapidly and he must prevent Ambrose and his henchmen from working out a deal with Biotech CEO John McCloy (Brendan Gleeson).

The transfer from Paramount looks pretty good although it doesn't appear as sharp looking as more recent releases (it came out in 2000 on DVD). If you purchased the single disc set stick with it; the second disc in the two disc set is a waste of money.

The first disc comes with some nice extras including a 15 minute featurette, a 30 minute section on the stunts that includes interviews with director John Woo and the stunt crew. This can be viewed as separate featurettes on each stunt and includes storyboards. Metallica's music video ""I Disappear"" also appears as well as an alternate opening sequence, the MTV Movie Awards parody ""Mission Improbable"" and interviews with Woo, Cruise and stunt coordinator Brian Smrz. Woo also provides a commentary track for the film.",1136073600,4,2173,5.030555555555556
819775,4,6304233965,"Yes, it's true!  DIE HARD 2, TERMINATOR 2 and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 have all surpassed the originals, in my opinion.  Even when I was a kid, I thought SUPERMAN II outsoared the original for action.

When you sit down to watch an action film, you have to remember to judge if for what kind of an action film it is.  Immediately, you have to be prepared to suspend some disbelief and keep the possibilities open.  Is the plot even somewhat intelligent?  Is the acting any good?  Is the action in-your-face-relentless without being too stupid?  My answer for MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 is an unequivelled ""yes"" to all of them.

The plot takes on a more James Bond-ish approach, with Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, out to stop a former MI agent from releasing a deadly virus on the population of Australia.  With him, is his ""Bond girl-ish"" sidekick and damsel in distress, Nia, played by Thandie Newton.  Combined with the hardcore action of director John Woo, you cannot help but enjoy this film.  The spectacular motorcycle sequence alone is worth your time.

The acting is as good as it can get for an action film.  Some lines stick out favorably like, ""Well, Mr. Hunt, this isn't Mission Difficult.  This is Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" and ""That punk put a hole in my Versache!"" oh, and my personal favorite:

""She doesn't have the experience for a job like this.""

""What, to go to bed with a man and lie to him?  She's a woman, she has all the experience she needs.""

Sorry, ladies, I'm not sexist, but it IS funny.

Tom Crusie movies, for me, have always been a guilty pleasure.  And I must say, if the rumors are true, and he is gay, his action role of Ethan Hunt in I, II and the upcoming III does a terrific job of covering it up.

Terrible acting, horrible, forgettable dialogue, terrible everything! Yes, it does have more action in it than the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. In fact, that might be one of its flaws; everything that was good about the first ""Mission Impossible"" (the secretiveness and subtlety, the good acting, and especially the mystery) is gone! This movie is completely one-dimensional and it has no depth whatsoever, and barely any plot! One scene after another is full of just shooting and death. Tom Cruise's character, who is a bad rip off of James Bond, kills so many people, he's barely even a good guy, anymore. And the villians are so evil, they verge on self parody. Two other flaws this movie has is the scenes blend together and the characters use masks ENTIRELY too much.

Woo and Cruise are an incredible team, turning a standard Hollywood action scenario into an overwhelming work of art. John Woo's pictures are unparalleled and burst of magic, subtext and sheer visual power whilst keeping a very distinct touch unlike any other director's. He loads every frame with metaphors and has a fantastically talented eye for angles, speed, cuts, effects and expression. Tom Cruise, while somewhat limited in expression as an actor, plays the role he plays best (and does a quite good job with it) and contributes insane stunts that add a previously unseen intensity to the action scenes so far not matched by any other action movie. Add a story which is at least as complex as better James Bond movies (hence no insult to the viewer's intellect) and impressive co-actors. Dougray Scott gives a memorable performance as the charismatic villain (definitely a more noteworthy actor), and Thandie Newton convincingly makes the most of her role. Especially these two (though it would be unfair not to mention that Tom Cruise adds to this, too) bring the tensions and intrigues constructed by Robert Towne and John Woo to life thus helping create a very dense athmosphere. Overall, this is a larger-than-life, overwhelming movie, a modern fairytale, full of metaphors, technically extremely sophisticated and yet ""real"", nearly raw. Very emotional and yet credible (even though what we see is absolutely not). A masterpiece of the genre, and possibly Cruise's and Woo's best work.

Director John Woo tosses out the subtleties that De Palma tried wreaking in the first MI, instead tieing the script along with action sequences that don't get excite as much as annoy. The idea of turncoat IMF spies is intriguing, and the evil Sean Ambrose has some of his own tricks, but Woo doesn't do much with the possibility, directing as with a 9mm.

  The fact that the virus comes into the hands of 'terroists'and they have to be stopped before it is unleashed on the world, already makes this film rather formulaic and unoriginal.

  All the gimmicky face changing doesnt add to the suspense, it just annoys the viewer, because its a easy way to create twists in a film with a weak plot.

  Theres a variation on the big rope drop into a computer room which was the main part of the first movie. From this point on theres a lot of action and killing of the bad guys, and it becomes obvious that John Woo knows what hes doing in this respect.

  Finally Tom cruise should be praised for the stunts he performs in the movie, the mountain climbing sequence and the motorcycle showdown are both top class stunts.

I saw this ""movie"" when it came out in 2000 in the theatre.  I had seen the first Mission Impossible and was pleased.  This sequel is what is quintessentially wrong with Hollywood.  When a movie makes some money, immediately Hollywood wants to run out and make another one and rake in more bucks at the expense of good story telling.  I swear, if they could, they'd make a Titanic 2.
(But what does this have to do with your review title?) We'll here it is.  I was so disappointed, so mad, so angry that this garbage made it to a movie theatre and charged ME over 8 bucks to see it, that 5 years after it came out, I'm still angry.  So angry I'm writing a review about how awful this mess is.  To put it another way, If I could travel to another dimension in time and space, the pain that watching this movie would cause, would still reach me.  So what am I talking about, exactly?  The last 15 minutes of the movie alone will make my point.  To be sure, this uber-toxic disease which required its first subject to be hospitalized, bed ridden with weeping soars and pustules, only causes our female hero a slight red eye and sniffly nose even though she has had the same level of exposure.  Tom Cruise can somehow kick a gun laterally, in the sand, have it ""pop up"" 3 feet in the air grab it, aim and fire at a low lying target (the villain) who already has a bead on Tom with gun fully loaded.  Tom gets off two shots and our villian can't hit the broad side of a barn. (lame isn't the word) The motorcycle scene when Tom (ethan hunt) is skidding on the ground with his feet (roller skates) and doesn't get thrown off his bike.  The director with his ""white doves"" nonsense as tom enters a room to shoot everybody as some sort of holier-than-thou-bad-ass.  If I ever met either tom cruise or john woo in real life, i'd demand they pay me the 20 bucks (ticket, popcorn and soda) that I shelled out for watching this garbage.  I'd also strap them to a chair and make them watch 2 hours of static and make them loose two hours of their lives.  Why am I writing this now?

The story is a little overplayed, and the movie has to much of a Bond feel to it at times. Despite that the action will blow you away and Cruise is the man.

Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is on vacation when it's cut short. He must recruit sexy thief Nyah(Newton) to help him in his next case. A dangerous virus Chimera has been stolen by an IMF employee.

That ex employee Sean Ambrosse(Scott) plans on selling the virus to the highest bidder. Now Hunt and Sean's ex-love Nyah must stop him before all is lost.

The plot is worn over and has been used way to much. It's pretty predictable the whole movie. That where the writing team has to be put to blame. You know exactly what's going to happen before it does, but what saves the film is it's star and director.

Tom Cruise is the man. He produced this movie with his production partner Paula Wagner. Like the first MI film he's all over this. His acting is good for what he's given to work with. He's a little to James Bond like at times, but you'll learn to look past that. His action sequences in the film are amazing. Tom Crusie did all his stunts in the film. Let me say again that Cruise did all his stunts in the movie. From the rock climbing to the bike riding they are amazing. I think it's great that a star with his kind of power will do it. He loves doing it to, and it really adds to the movie.

John Woo really does some great action in the picture. The chases and fight scenes are awesome. Everybody that sees this film will see something they've never seen before and that makes it fun. I loved the whole bird thing and was waiting to see the white dove which is one of his call signs. Woo does a good job of directing with what he's given to work with.

The DVD extras are pretty good. You have a 15 minute special behind the making of the movie, and there's another five minute one about the stunts. Throw in a Metalica music video and you have above average extras.

I did enjoy this movie. I bought it and I wasn't to upset. The movie was a little to Jame Bond for me and the story was weak. Despite that the action makes it a four star film.

The main thing to say about MI2 is that, like the first one, it isn't a Mission Impossible story. Mission Impossible, to me, is a caper story, premised on impossible, or at least highly unfeasible missions, carried out by a team. This film, like the first one (which starts by wiping out the team almost as soon as they've been established with the viewer) has a couple of fairly bland henchmen with gadgets and that's all. A film almost entirely about Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's chiselled features, death-defying acrobatics and intrepid duelling with the chief villain, whatever its own merits, is simply not true to the premise of (or what was so good about) the show we remember from way back when.

820049,3,6304233965,"Although I can sympathize with reviewers who rated this movie poorly, it is evident the majority of negative responses are from those unfamiliar with John Woo. Very few times will I dare say the story might be secondary to the ""heart"" of a movie. This rarity only occurs when the source of that enjoyment comes from something above and beyond what the average moviegoer can experience.

Here is a case when the director is the actual ""star"" of the film. There is truly a magic with nearly all of his movies (we'll forget about Broken Arrow or Windtalkers for the time being) that no matter how implausible or phony the plot may be, there is such a majestic quality to Woo's art that one can't help but be amazed at what is being shown on screen.  Those familiar with some of his best ones (like his Chinese films Hardboiled & The Killer) are very aware of his trademarks.  These trademarks are not subtle in the least, but unless you know exactly what you *should* be looking for, you may feel lost (Did you ever wonder why a few select people in the theater loudly cheered during odd moments- like when a white dove was flying away in elaborate slow motion?).

It is unfortunate that watching Woo's previous works is sort of a prerequisite. There literally isn't one second that goes by without Woo's fingerprints everywhere. A similar example of how powerful a fan base can boost popularity are those who like Jackie Chan. His films are notorious for bad writing, terrible dialogue, and questionable acting.  Still, Jackie Chan became a popular icon across the world because of what his talent really is about.  Fans of Jackie Chan would feel cheated if it didn't showcase his insane death-defying stunts or his comical drawn-out fight scenes no matter how good the writing, dialogue, and acting may be.

Likewise, I must also grant this movie is purely cheap popcorn entertainment and should not be compared to other well written masterpieces like Schindler's List, The Sixth Sense, Memento, or American Beauty. MI:2 can, and should be compared to other movies of the action/spy genre. I don't know about the rest of you, but I found the story of MI:2 to be more interesting than the last 3 James Bond films combined.",1093651200,,2220,4.72093023255814

 Obviously influenced by the blockbuster movie ""Matrix"" (1999), ""Mission: Impossible 2"" switched from the complex style of the first movie, to a very different style plagued of explosions, summersaults and martial arts. Far less interesting than the original movie, but more dynamic and spectacular, ""Mission Impossible 2"" is perfect to relax a couple of hours, but definitely it isn't an essential movie.",1091750400,2,709,5.103448275862069

Um, ANYONE can direct a bunch of people to mock shoot at each other, while fireballs are being blown up, and pigeons flying, all to a ridiculous ""storyline"". It's not that difficult. I don't buy that Hong Kong bs. There are good action films that have come out of Hong Kong that actually posses a story. He just happened to do someone in Hollywood a favor. He's cancerously overrated, much like this film, which is a travesty to action films period. Why bother calling it Mission Impossible 2? It has NOTHING to do with the MI series. I liked the first film because, guess what? It actually had something to do with ESPIONAGE, which in case anyone forgot, is supposed to be what the DAMN FILM IS ABOUT!!!Why didn't anyone tell that to Woo? Oh yeah right.

The scenes with Roxburgh, and only the scenes with Roxburgh was what kept me alive during the film. Although when that stupid Tom Cruise killed Roxburgh's character the movie ended right there. The scene was when he switched their faces, and I thought Roxburgh's character had beaten the crap out of Cruise's character and they killed him and I was feeling quite happy for the moment, until, they pulled the face off of Cruise and it was Roxburgh instead. I was DREADFULLY upset. And then it showed Roxburgh running, but it was really Cruise since he hadn't pulled off his face yet. He should've left Roxburghs face on (at least he would've looked better), and then he ripped his face off and it was Tom Cruise, thus the movie ends.",1087948800,,862,4.567741935483871
820053,5,6304233965,"This movie is what action movies are all about. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and it does pretty well in other ways. The story is still pretty good, nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's still good. Some people may say that the save-the-world theme is old, but that's what action movies are about. Give me one James Bond film where 007 didn't do that. Give me any other action movie without that theme. Lord of the Rings had it. Star Wars had it. So does the fact that M:I-2's story revolves around someone saving the world make the movie bad? No way! It's the kind of plot that makes an action movie an action movie. Moving on. Like others have stated, the purpose of action in these movies is not to seem totally realistic, but to be really entertaining and fun to watch. Actually, it still is pretty realistic. What's all this junk about Ethan hitting all his shots (Which is pretty unrealistic, I'll admit)? Didn't any of you watch the Biocyte shootout? How many of his shots hit one of Ambrose's men? Maybe a quarter of them! He's still human and has down-to-earth abilities, not completely unrealistic superhuman stuff that a lot of people criticize. And besides, until the road chase, it is perfectly reasonable that Ethan didn't get shot! Half the time he was behind a wall or lurking in the shadows, waiting for the moment to go Splinter Cell on a patrolling guard. Anyway, sorry I lingered. The acting in this movie is great. Tom Cruise gives Ethan Hunt a very human qualities. Thandie Newton, who plays Nyah Hall, also does the same for her character. Ving Rhames returns to the comic-relief character Luther (the brilliant computer programmer from M:I),  and continues to give Luther the comical humor from the first movie. John Polson is introduced as the Australian helicopter pilot Billy Baird, and also gives a lot of humor to the movie.  And by the way, both Rhames and Polson do a great job of acting besides the humor, and bring the characters to life very well. Dougray Scott is the villain in this movie, and does it very nicely. He gives Sean Ambrose the kind of madman look and nicely combines it with cold-blooded intelligence to make the character a very good villain. And finally, Anthony Hopkins is Ethan's new leader, and does a very good support role. What about the music? Well, if you've seen the first movie, the music is just the same with a little metallic feel to it. And if you haven't, then don't worry, you won't be dissapointed. This is a great action movie that will keep you entertained throughout the two hours of the film, and does well in areas that some action films don't quite succeed in, despite what others say.",1086393600,,2687,4.595833333333333

820155,4,6304233965,"M:I-2 was a fine action film, of course it was made by John Woo so it was sure to offer solid action thrills.  Woo as always crafts superb action sequences which are intense and suspenseful.  The film featured an excellent motorcyle chase which was near the end, probably one of the best bike chases next to Woo's other film ""Paycheck"" which featured another great
bike chase.  The one thing that sets this film apart from the first is the action, sure the plot for the first was probably better and the first probably made more sense, but this movie should be a satisfying one just for the action.
  As for the plot well it's decent.  Essentially a deadly virus called chimera is unleashed and is extremely lethal.  He must stop an evil renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott)from unleashing this terror upon the world.  He must recruit Ambrose's ex-lover Nyal Hall (Thandie Newton)to assist him on the case in order to lure Ambrose into a trap and stop the virus chimera from spread on to the world.  Sure the plot may not be that compelling or so it sounds, but like I said you don't have to worry about that especially if you're an die-hard action fan.  Also the always amazing Anthony Hopkins comes in as Hunt's boss and advisor.
  Tom Cruise gives a certain edge to role of Ethan Hunt and he sure does play it well.  I must say I do prefer this installment over the first Mission Impossible, is it the action or the action?  Who knows?
  M:I-2 is rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violent Action
and Some Sensuality.  The violence includes gunplay, fistfights and explosions.  The sexual content is mild, mainly some innuendo nothing explicit or graphic really.  No profanity.
Ethan Hunt in a way is an American version of James Bond, he's got the girl, the gadgets (nowhere near as sophisticated or cool as Bond's though) and the ride.  If you like John Woo, I highly recommend this one, definetly for the action, the breathtaking bike chase to an intense climactic fight between Cruise and Scott.  Worth owning on Video or DVD.",1074988800,,2042,4.648044692737431
820156,4,6304233965,"This is an action film and the main interest is the action itself. The point is that it is well built, entertaining and extremely credible which makes the action all the more acceptable. The acting is also extremely good with a brilliant Tom Cruise. But the film has some depth, some real depth. We are speaking here of terrorism, but the type that comes from global criminals. They are white, European or American, and they only aim at making a lot of money by forcing some not-too-ethical businessmen spit out much money under the pressure of some blackmail, though this blackmail leads these businessmen to making even more money than they are forced to spit out. A  gentleman's agreement  in a way. This type of crime, of terrorism is common and frequent, but most of the time unknown and even well hidden. The topic of the film is even more uptodate than we may imagine. A pharmaceutical firm invents a killing germ and the drug that can stop it. The objective is quite obviously to release the germ into the public in order to sell the drug. But a criminal gets his hands on both the germ and the drug and then can blackmail the businessman. This denunciation of pharmaceutical firms is not unique and it plays on the fear among the public that some new disease should appear and kill millions of people. We know about AIDS. We know about the SRAS. We know about Mad Cow disease. But do we know everything ? That is particularly frightening, though the film tries to reassure us by showing some people who fight against this, even to the death if necessary. A disquieting film anyway.

820157,4,6304233965,"Maybe it was because I was in the mood for a blockbuster action thriller or maybe it's because I was never a huge fan of the original film in the first place, but Mission: Impossible II satisfied my craving for an adrenaline rush and on that basis alone, I highly recommend it. Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first M:I for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.
Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts. His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen. Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia. Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.
Through and through, M:I-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production. Almost all his signatures are here: balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of Mexican standoff. The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect. M:I-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, but the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.
What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes. Well, that's not entirely true. There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in. What's to hold our attention until then? Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material. We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.
When the action hits, M:I-II is almost a non-stop action extravaganza, delivering tense gun battles, a breathtaking and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death. Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves. He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production. Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker. Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.
From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to M:I-II, it's how lovely the film looks. Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at. As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but M:I-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating.",1073347200,,3268,4.755281690140845

820159,3,6304233965,"I'm giving this movie 3 stars, but more on the side of two, rather than four. I found it boring & predictable. And the don't take at face value is absolutely necessary. You don't know who people are going to be, as the mask of people's faces which was touched upon in the first movie, is now severely overdone in this, and now has a little sticker across the voice box, to make the voices the same too.
Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, and along with Ving Rhames, are the only two surviving members of the previous film. Along come a whole host of other characters, including Thandie Newton, and Dougray Scott - a sterotyped Scottish character, playing the bad guy as usual.
This movie seems to steal a lot from a hyped film, which has influenced a lot of other movies - The Matrix. This film has a lot to answer to these days in the movie world, and I was disappointed to see Tom Cruise/John Woo steal certain bits to make their film better - and I'm sorry to say they failed.
There are a lot of fight scenes in this, but they're not sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat fight scenes. They're overdone, and don't really have any effect on you.
I was also disappointed by Tom Cruise in this. I much preferred his hair in the first film - the buzz cut - than his overlong, and unkempt look in this film. A year or so after this, Tom famously divorced Nicole Kidman, in favour of Penelope Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised if Nicole was jealous after seeing this film, as Tom & Thandie (Newton) have a lot of chemistry, very unusual in co-stars. The fact that she also wears lots of low cut tops with push up bras probably helped.
I loved the scenes featuring Tom & Thandie, or just Thandie alone, cos the music in the background was really nice and peaceful. The Mission Impossible score is used quite a lot, but it sounded different to the original, and is overused and overloud at some points.
Overall, I'm not disappointed I bought this film (it was on sale). And of course its a sequel, so I wasn't really expecting much. But I hope Tom Cruise doesn't think he's going to be onto a good thing if he churns out another one. We all know how the third movie always disappoints.",1069200000,,2180,4.398514851485149

820161,5,6304233965,"It's funny that people take action movies so seriously. Action movies are like popcorn movies and are made for just a fun movie experience. So from the beginning when you go to see an action/popcorn movie you shouldn't expect to see an in-depth storyline, 3-dimensional characters, or great acting (though this film does a bit better in that area than most). What you should expect to see is of course good action, good cinematography, cheesy one-liners, and good special fx - which this film has in spades.
So if you don't like action movies, then you won't like this one (I would've thought that was obvious, but some people have a rough time with it).
This is the most skillfully-made action movie in the past 10 years - or since Hard Boiled, though Desperado definitely gives it a run for its money - and Kill Bill has now topped MI2, but that's my opinion :P.
Good action movies are hard to come by and few people appreciate them, either because they insist that every film should be art (in its defined form) and/or that in order for a movie to be good it must succeed on every area (i.e. acting, cinematography, dialogue, etc.). I agree with these and truely enjoy well-thoughtout and artsy movies (Glengary Glenross, Taxi Driver, The Man Who Fell to Earth, Memento, Adaptation, too many to list). Every once and while though it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't have too many levels working at once. One that's focusing on just one thing and it does that one thing very well -MI2 is that kind of movie.",1067472000,2,1517,4.601476014760148
820162,3,6304233965,"For my box office money, Year 2000 was one of the worst ever, with a plethora of bloated, overlong, overrated flicks (""Gladiator,"" ""Cast Away,"" ""What Lies Beneath,"" ""The Patriot,"" ""Perfect Storm""). Though not by any means a great movie, ""M:I-2"" rises to the top of my memory almost by default. It's dumb, but at least it's fast and entertaining.
John Woo knows how to stage, direct and photograph action sequences, and it's a good thing his star, Tom Cruise, knows how to act in them and even how to perform many of his own stunts. ""M:I-2"" wisely conserves the wildest action for about the last 45 minutes, beginning with Cruise's daring penetration of a high-rise and ending with probably the longest fistfight sequence in history.
I didn't believe a minute of this silly, slick, superficial piece of eye candy. The good thing is, Woo and Cruise don't ask us to. They intend only to seduce us with surface level charm. They succeed, brilliantly. Here is an action movie that takes the effort to find poetry in its visuals, like the extended scene that introduces Cruise's affable spy, Ethan Hunt, to the femme fatale, Nyah, played fetchingly by the alluring Thandie Newton. It's a flirtatious dance with larceny at its core, taken to a new level by the mountaintop car chase, another dance that leads eventually to physical passion. We may not care about Ethan and Nyah, but wow, they look great together.
Much of ""M:I-2"" is over the top and ridiculous, and a lot of the dialogue is banal, taking us from Point A to Point B. But Woo finds all sorts of ways to make the movie interesting without dialogue. Maybe the best news of all is that this never, for a moment, feels like a sequel, thankfully because Cruise intends each entry in the franchise to feel like a brand-new, standalone film (never mind the numeral in the title). Think what Tarantino could do with this material.
""Think."" Now there's a word you don't want anywhere near ""M:I-2."" At least this movie has the courage to live up to its own mindlessness. And I won't even gripe about the bad Anthony Hopkins performance. Are Cruise and Woo that good? Yep, they are.",1065484800,,2129,4.695187165775401

Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt and is now on a mission to stop a renegade IMF agent from selling a deadly virus to terrorists. The action scenes are loaded with great explosions, cool fist and gun fights as well as some seriously awesome music from Hans Zimmer. This is an action movie that redefines its genre. The Bond films really changed after this movie came out. This is an action movie that relies on scenery and execution rather than its stars. It's a constantly-exciting and riveting film with some of the best action in recent history. Woo went on to make his worst film yet, ""Windtalkers,"" but its failure wasn't because of bad direction, but more of lack of intelligence or research.

Here are what I have for MI2
1)Good music and great CGI special effect.  Although some scenes are unbelieveable(eg. opening climb), it's flawless to me unless I slow-motion every second.
2)Tom is a one-man-army, he's more a James Bond than working as a team.  I heard MI1 is about team work.
3)Tom is great looking in that leather jacket.  I'm not a chick but I say he's so cool that I want that jacket.
4)Overdone on mask tricks.  You can put a mask on to pretend someone but body built and voices can be hard to copy.
5)Wild flying kicks.  You see Tom does this jump kicks all the time(more than 4 at last scene, I lost count), the problem for Tom is that he's a natural stiff.  He ain't Jet Li or someone who can do at ease.  He barely touches the bad guy.
6)His romance with the girl is thin to me.  I think that's John Woo's style.  He is good making movies with excitment.

820287,4,6304233965,"Many fans of the television series found the first Mission: Impossible film to be a disappointing adaptation to the big screen.  The addition of legendary Honk Kong action film guru John Woo--still seeking a true breakthrough US hit--promised a better sequel than the original.
The plot: a superbug whose science is a bit unplausible infects red blood cells and spreads a devastating disease.  Suave bad-guy Sean Ambrose steals the virus with the intent of infecting the world's population and selling the antidote to the pharmaceutical company that developed the virus.  The IMF team--headed by Cruise's Ethan Hunt and assisted by a beautiful jewel thief--must recover the antidote and stop Ambrose before he can carry out the deed.
The action sequences don't disappoint and are definitely the product of Woo's involvement, including trademark slow-motion sequences framed by flames, smoke, etc.; doves flying through all-out warfare; impressive motorcycle stunts; and the obligatory shot of good guy vs. bad guy with guns pointed at each others' heads.  Where some may find the plot somewhat lacking and perhaps constructed to service said action sequences, the film is somewhat weaker than might have been hoped, but overall it doesn't disappoint like the first movie.  My chief complaint is the lack of involvement by the remaining IMF team members; the film seems almost totally devoted to showing Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton's good looks rather than performing the team-effort so intrisnic to episodes of the original television series.",1047859200,,1544,5.363636363636363

I cannot stress how poor and cliche every seen is in ""M:I 2."" The Matrix-like fight scenes were both the best and worst of the movie. Best example of over-use of a recent cliche, and worst example of quality, accuracy, and originality. Even in the motorcycle scenes, Woo made no effort to hide that they drastically changed the tire design from one scene to the next. Sound like a small detail? Watch for it in the movie, it takes away credibility (not that Woo even makes an attempt to create any). Also, the Lisa Gerrard-like music (Gladiator) screamed cinematic pop cliche, and unoriginality. The quality of John Woo's work should have him making McDonald's commercials, rather than film.

So I was excited to hear that he would be directing the sequel to Mission Impossible, a personal favorite of mine.  When I finally got to see it, I wasn't disappointed: this is the most stylish action movie I have seen.  But everyone I know, including John Woo fans, hated it.  Sure, it's no Killer or Hard Boiled, but it was very entertaining.  Here's a list of why everyone hates this movie:
1. The plot.  Okay, I'll admit, the plot wasn't that great.  But you don't walk into a movie like this for fascinating plot points. You go to be entertained.
2. Ethan Hunt does things that are not humanly possible.  Well, that may be true, but maybe that's why it's called Mission ""Impossible"". C'mon, we all know that you can't do any of those stunts in real life, but it's fun to pretend you can for at least two hours. Sometimes I go to the movies to be intellectually challenged.

Would someone please slap John Woo and tell him to knock it off with the slow motion scenes? If it wasn't for the first mission impossible success I don't think half the people who went and saw the sequel would have gone. I still don't know why I bought this movie. It was part of a large order that I had a $20 coupon for.

THE STORY:
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns to prevent the bad guy from unleashing a biological horror on the world.
THE ANALYSIS:
Personally, I found the story to be a bit on the boring side honestly.  The action sequences and cinematography (as you'd expect from a John Woo film) were just AWESOME.  The movie had a mix of romantic elements in it as well.
For me though, and this could be just me personally, I found myself phasing out for most of the movie and only really perking up for the action sequences.
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
The DVD features do not disappoint.  Beautifully designed and chalked full of great stuff, DVD fans should be pleased with this offering.
1. Behind Mission:  14 minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette with interviews of the cast and crew discussing the movie.
2. Mission Incredible:  5 minute featurette discussing how the action sequences and stunts were filmed.  Pretty enlightening stuff.
3. Impossible Shots:  Director John Woo discusses how several of the key action sequences were filmed.  Again, cool stuff.
4. Commentary:  Feature length audio commentary by Director John Woo.  Always interesting to hear.
5. Metallica music video, ""I Disappear.""  4 minutes.  Better than average music video for a movie.
6. Alternate Opening Sequence:  30 seconds.  Pretty cool.
7. Mission Improbable:  6 minute gag interview with Tom Cruise's stunt double, ""Tom Crooze.""  Features footage from previous Cruise films.
8. DVD-ROM:  More cool things for you on your PC.
THE VERDICT:
Well, if you are big on some pretty cool and visually stunning action scenes, this is the ticket for you.  Substance wise though, I found this a bit lacking...",1026000000,,1801,5.02027027027027

Ethan Hunt is too smart to get into a fight such as the one in the climax of this movie. Where is the intrigue, the espionage, the thinking man's Ethan Hunt?  Apart from the cool opening sequence there is little in my opinion to redeem this movie.  The Producer made a fatal mistake in getting John Woo to Direct this movie.

Starting out with a literal cliffhanger, the film takes off with some good action scenes and trademark coolness from the Cruiser. But events seem somewhat un-involving, lacklustre even, as the plot meanders slowly along, with some boring sub-plots and un-inspired dialogue. And Thandie Newton provides eye candy but very little else. However the Anthony Hopkins cameo is very welcome and saves the rather tedious mid section. Finally, after some extended plot twists, we see the Woo trademarks: cool action, Slo-mo gunfights and those perennial doves. Then the action roars off with the last half-hour being one huge action wallop, with an enormous amount of stunts and explosions, leaving the viewer wanting a breather. Then we are greeted with the ""bad guy and good guy punch up"" ending, which is exciting, if somewhat brutal. In short, been there, done that. Sold action can't cover the film's flaws.

By any chance you a little sick of that?!  In the real world maybe one thing happens by chance, maybe; but the rest of it the goodguy has to make up with skill or else the badguy wins.  Well in this movie that is exactly what happens.  The goodguy here is not lucky at all, but skilled in the highest degree of combat, survival, and military tactics of any hollywood warrior I've ever seen.

820512,3,6304233965,"Mission: Impossible 2 is sleek, sexy and stylish. After you see, you might decided, as I did, that it really isn't that good of a movie, mainly because the plot isn't all that interesting. There are a lot of neat things in the film which almost but not quite overcome the weak story.
Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire for a shadowy international organization. A rock climbing vacation is cut short when his boss, Swanbeck [Anthony Hopkins] summons him. A renegade ex-agent, Sean Ambrose [Dougray Scott] has kidnapped a doctor off a commercial flight from Australia to Atlanta and in the process has caused the plane to crash. It takes awhile for Hunt to figure out what the doctor had that was so valuable. When he does, he finds that millions of lives may be at risk. At Swanbeck's insistence, Hunt recruits a beautiful thief named Nyah {Thandie Newton] to help him. It is not until after they have fallen for each other that Hunt learns the true reason Swanbeck wanted her. She is Ambose's ex-girlfriend. Swanbeck intends to use her to infiltrate Ambrose's house. This is a situation that Hunt is not at all happy with.
Cruise plays Hunt differently than he did in the first Mission: Impossible. He is cocky and sure of himself this time, and I think this works better. He is required at times to get into situations no mere mortal would live through, but consider the title. His scenes with Newton sizzle. You can almost feel the chemistry. Ms. Newton gives her role her best shot. She is required to go from independent and spirited to being your basic damsel in distress. Dougray Scott is quite convincing as the nefarious Ambrose. Anthony Hopkins has only two scenes as Swanbeck, but, as usual, he makes the most of them.
Director John Woo should be credited for giving Mission: Impossible 2 a look and feel it probably doesn't deserve. Such visual beauty is most often reserved for more thoughtful fare. The shots of Hunt climbing a rock face in the desert are awesome. The movie's many explosions are well executed. The shootouts are highly stylized and have the look of a well choreographed dance. If the story had been as ingenious as the photography, this would have been a classic.",1016409600,,2212,4.718346253229974
820513,4,6304233965,"I think people are too hard on this film. Yes it's the worse of the 3 films but I still really like it. Tom did ruin the Mission Impossible though franchise by making everything about just one guy instead of a team like the tv series. Like I said in my Mission Impossible 1 review, he's a pure ego actor that made everything about Ethan Hunt who he happens to play. I don't even think Ethan was in the tv serries. Jim was the main guy and in the first film they made him turn bad.

  While the first was all brains, this one hardly has any. It's a pure"" look at me I'm Tom Cruise film"". It's just him showing off for 2 hours. If you saw the maing of part 3 on Spike TV where Tom talks the making of all 3 films, he basically takes credit for everything! While talking about part 2 he says ""it was my idea to have the knife come extremely close to my eye because that was never done in film before"". He's such a know it all that's so into himself. Mission Impossible is supposed to be about teams working together in secret missions and since he produces the movies eveything is about him.

  Tom wants each Mission Impossible to be different with a different director each time. That's probably the only idea of his I really like. Here John Woo directs and yes he made a bad Mission Impossible movie but managed to make a fun stunt show of a movie. The whole plot is basically about Tom falling for a women who's going to be used for a secret mission. They wanna use her since she used to go out with the main villian. The whole movie is basically about him trying to save her....so they can hold hands at the end to some sweet music when you know he'll just have a new g/f in part 3.

  Dougray Scott (Heist, Dark Water) at least adds some coolness to the film as the villian. He probably should've chose playing Wolverine in X-Men instead of doing this though. Instead he was replaced by Hugh Jackman and it did wonders for Jackman's career. While Dougray Scott is barely seen in a movies and his show Heist was cancelled already. At least he was one of the better things about Mission Impossible 2. It's nice seeing Anthony Hopkins in the film too as Ethan's boss eventhough he's sorta wasted.

  John Woo wasn't the best choice for a MI film since his direction is either too stylish with too much slow motion and close-ups. Brian De Palma at least focused on the plot. Woo and Cruise here just care about action shots and what looks cool. I can see why people hate the film but I still I find it hard to. It's a not a bad escape movie. You wanna get away from your problems, you can throw it with some surround sound and still have  a  good time. Like I said it's a stunt show and that's about it. I Plan on seeing part 3 today and hopefully that one has action and...a brain unlike this film which just has action.",1015804800,,2820,4.198148148148148
820514,2,6304233965,"Tom Cruise gives the impression these days that his mere appearance on a movie screen is enough to send shivers of delight through thousands of theatergoers (he may be right; Cruise has NEVER had a box office dud).
MI-2 lacks many of the elements that made the first film a lot of fun.  ""Mission 1"" had a convuluted plot that no one could follow, which almost added to the enjoyment; the plot for the second film is so thin it would barely fill an hour of the TV series; in fact it's hard to believe the screenwriter who gave us ""Chinatown"" was really responsible (though Robert Towne admits he came on the project AFTER the action scnes had been planned and written).
For MI-2, Cruise and his co-producer, Paula Wagner, enlist the talents of Hong Kong director, John Woo, who stages his action scenes with a balletic style, but Woo has no flair for non-action scenes, so the first hour of ""MI-2"" is paced slower than a Merchant Ivory romance.
Although, Cruise and the incredible gorgeous Thandie Newton, make a couple that could grace the cover of any issue of GQ, they ignite no sparks on the screen, and as a villian, the talented Dougray Scott can do no more with his role than pretend to look menacing.
Cruise was smart to get involved with the ""Mission"" franchise, it gives him the financial clout to take on riskier projects such as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Vanilla Sky,"" but with MI-2, he's produced an action film for people who hate action films.
DVD package is exceptional...picture and sound quality are excellent and many bonus features include two documentaries; behind the scenes look at many of the action sequences; and the hilarious MTV ""Mission Improbable"" satire featuring Ben Stiller as Tom CROOZE..",1014595200,2,1717,4.723333333333334

Loud, in your face, fast and the chase scene at the end is almost like a queue of stuntmen and directorrs all having 3 minutes to outdo each other as the finale becomes more frantic, outrageous and improbable utilising every type of vehicle the production people could get their hands on.

820517,4,6304233965,"In an effort to make up for the lags of the first Mission Impossible, MI:2 goes for the action.  The first one was cerebral and bizarre at times, succeeding at not making itself clear in some scenes, typical of Brian De Palma films that usually fall flat at the end.  It can be surmised that when Tom Cruise, who served as producer on the first and second film realized the lack of excitement in the first one, he wanted to make sure the action scenes in the sequel would be spectacular.

He succeeded by hiring John Woo as the director.  Woo's claim to fame is action movies, doing such adrenaline pumped hits as Face/Off, Broken Arrow and several high energy Hong Kong actions flicks.  Unfortunately, the story's IQ was shaved in order to counter the fear that people might this one confusing too.  The MI TV series was always like a bad dream, you never knew what could happen next or who you could trust.  Although the first MI followed that pattern, the second one throws it out the window.  The villain is made clear from the beginning...sort of.

The plot is typical Spy thriller stuff; Mega virus is stolen, secret government agents go after the man who has it, wackiness ensues in the form of killer actions scenes and the hero saves the day.  No one is called on to do any kind of stretch of their acting chops.  One main complaint I have is the forced romance between Ethan and Nyah (a prominent Jewel thief played by the smoldering Thandie Newton).  The two have no chemistry.  This is unfortunate because I like them as a couple, but there isn't much to like between them on screen.

The movie is simple and the action scenes are awesome if not bordering on absurd.  I give Cruise high praise and credit for beefing up and doing almost all of his own stunt work and fight scenes, it's quite convincing.  Especially the rock climbing scene at the beginning, the motorcycle chase and the climatic fight scene at the end.

There were at least three requisite pulling off the fake face routine and by the third time not only was there no suspense it was obvious for even a third grader to figure out.
As far as the directing is concerned, yes John Woo is a great director, but he must have shot half the movie in slow motion which made the movie seem ponderous and self indulgent.

820729,2,6304233965,"This blunderbuss of a movie was supposed to be saved by having John Woo make it look good; however, nothing can save a conceptual abortion of this magnitude. Throwing money at it only makes the effect worse, as if drinking more Cuervo Gold will make the hangover more bearable. This movie was a total overcompensation for the incredibly inscrutable ""Mission Impossible I"". In that movie, the double twist was supposed to look intelligent, after an hour-and-a-half of incoherent garbage in the guise of an ""heavy"" plot that didn't make a lick of sense. ""Mission Impossible II"" reaches for the other extreme when it was realized that good writing is necessary for that sort of thing. Since ""MI:1"" looks positively clever next to this fatuous mess, it seems that the ""concept committee"" didn't feel like rubbing two brain cells together to achieve the critical mass needed to pull off a decent script. ""MI:2"" has such a simplistic plot, yet they still need to pull the 'fake mask' thing whenever things start getting muddled. Every supposed ""shocker/twist"" is utterly predictable. The premise is totally ludicrous, and bascially everything lacks any kind of proportion. Tom Cruise is so dull in his line delivery, it is embarrassing how supposedly charismatic the whole thing is supposed to be. The amazing thief, as the female lead, never really does anything that amazing except open a door all by herself and pick a lock. The ""witty"" exchanges with the hot chick are so hammy that the dialogue about satellites and laptops are infinitely more interesting. John Woo's attempted rescue of this lukewarm creation revolves around various visual scenes that are interesting in and of themselves.

820731,3,6304233965,"Mission Impossible 2 has Tom Cruise playing Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent. He is sent on a mission to stop another IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who has sold out and stolen a deadly genetically-engineered virus. Having both the virus and the cure, Ambrose's plan is to release the virus and him having the only antidote, will be filthy rich. Using the help of Nyah Nordof-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's ex-girlfriend, Ethan Hunt go after Ambrose.
First, the problems with this movie: 1) The director John Woo may have made this movie exploding with action, but why did he have to have so many slow motion scenes? Also, sometimes you see the same scene repeated over and over. Whenever it does that, I always blink my eyes a couple of times to make sure I'm not seeing double! 2) The plot is so very, very simple, you can already guess the ending. 3) I don't know how Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt could have fallen for Nyah Nordof-Hall (Thandie Newton)? The romance wasn't that hot. Like when they first meet, their eyes are locked for what seems like eternity (or was it that long?)... Cruise's and Newton's face don't change at all! 4) As some other people have stated, some of the things Tom Cruise were just next to impossible that it seemed silly! (Later I'll explain how sometimes this isn't so bad.) Like when Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott crash into each other, jumping off their motorcycles. 5) The showdown at the end with Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott was too, too, long. Every time you feel like it was going to finish, one or the other gets out a gun or a knife.
All right, finally, to the good parts. 1) Like I said before, some of the stunts and action were just too impossible. But this movie is mission impossible so some parts I didn't mind like when the knife comes very, VERY close to Hunt's eye. That scared the life out of me! 2) The action was really awesome! Like when Hunt is trapped in the laboratory and when he climbs the cliffs in the beginning.
As for the special features, there's so many things you can look at. There's one feature I particularily like, the ""Impossible Shots"" with interviews with Tom Cruise, John Woo and Stunt Coordinator Brian Smrz. There is one hitch though, I can't tell if John Woo is speaking English or not! He has the worst accent you've ever heard and he keeps repeating the same words! Whenever I see these ""Impossible Shots"", I always skip the part with John Woo. Believe me, you're not missing much.
So, here's my conclusion for this movie. It's not that great, not that bad. This is the type of entertainment which you don't have to think so much to watch it, just be dazzled by the effects. If you want to watch a movie with lots of spectacular scenes and a good plot, watch ""Matrix"".",998179200,2,2749,4.5

820735,2,6304233965,"The inferior sequel rears its ugly head yet again.  Classic John Woo action is the only thing that makes this movie.  Other than that, there is nothing else that you will find remarkable.
First of all, the surprises, twists and turns and shocks of the first movie are just completely left out in this movie.  You never would have expected some of the events in the first one to happen, but they did.  In this film, you see everything coming a mile away.  The very few scenes that are intended to be shocking or surprising are too blatantly obvious to deliver the effect.
The plot suffers from misdirection and boredom.  With a cheesy love sub-plot thrown into a story about a killer virus that a former IMF agent is eager to get his hands on, there isn't much you'll find enjoyable or engrossing.  Missing the suspense of the original, you won't need to think or try to put two and two together.  And once again, a renegade IMF agent is the villain.  What is it with these guys?  Do they go evil after they have one too many missions?  Everything is pretty much right there on a platter.
The action is classic John Woo, but becomes way too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Ethan Hunt has accuracy with his gun that would make the Terminator jealous, and pulls off stunts that are just a bit too over-the-top for my tastes.  I also didn't know that they make guns with unlimited ammo nowadays.  Throughout the whole movie, you will see Ethan Hunt reload his gun no more than one time.  The motorcycle and driving stunts are done fairly well, but again, become too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Last time I checked, Ethan Hunt was an IMF agent, not Neo from the Matrix.
Overall, if you want some mindless action and crazy stunts, then you might enjoy this movie.  However, if you enjoyed the first movie, you will probably find that this sequel is going to fall short of expectations.  The film moves slowly, and the end fight drags on way too much, at which point you will be asking yourself 'when is it gonna end?'

820811,3,6304233965,"I was surprised to discover that this is a refashioning of Hitchcock's 1946 classic ""Notorious.""  While Cruise and Newton are no Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, they don't try to be.  Refreshingly, the film only borrows the shell of the story, without trying to be some kind of remake.
Thandie Newton is, in particular, a pleasure in this film.  Not only does she have truckloads of screen presence, is strikingly beautiful (I can't stop watching her when she's onscreen), and can actually act, she has been given an actual flesh and blood, thinking, real character to portray ... not just ""the woman.""
I was disappointed in one scene, though, where she - an obviously skilled pickpocket - makes the grevious error of replacing an item into the wrong pocket from which she'd originally picked it, which reveals herself to the villain.
However, later, she regains this ground when she injects herself with the virus, turning herself from a somewhat disposable character into suddenly the most valuable person in the room.
But what I like most about this film is something I like about other Woo films I've seen (Face/Off).  He takes characters who symbolically represent figures from ancient mythology and puts them into an arena to fight it out.  This film tells you in the first sentence what the story is really about:  ""When you set out to create a hero, you must first create something that all heroes require:  a villain.""
We return to this theme at the very end during the motorcycle chase.  When the two men fly off of those cycles and slam into each other, we finally have our hero and our villain, our virus and antivirus, engaged in mortal combat - each as brutal, each as determined, each as clever.
Wordlessly pounding each other on that surf-battered shore, in truly operatic fashion, the film elevates from a mere action movie to the level of mythology, and to one myth in particular:  the desperate battle between good and evil.
Woo realizes this myth on the screen in true, splashy, Saturday matinee fashion, and - on that level - it is quite a pleasure to watch!",993513600,3,2078,4.766016713091922

From the openning, MI2 tries to convince viewers that Tom Cruise is some kind of indistructable super man; and tries to prove this point through out the movie: from killing a dozen bad guys without break a sweat to collide in the mid air with a another person and get right back up.
Why did Tom Cruise recruit that girl is beyond me, since she has done nothing through out the film, except to make Cruise look like James Bond.  If she was anything, she was more of a burden.
The story and characters are cartoonish and idiotic.  Nosense plot.  Cruise seems to know before hand which bad guy he's going to meet, and has a mask of that particular enemy ready.
Slow motion artist my behind.  All those slow motions really slows down the action.  Too much editings.  Every action sequence seems to have been edited a dozen times from a dozen angles.  And how am I going to enjoy the action, when I all I can see is Tom Cruise's face.  Very dumb shots, like a dove through the flame, wow, our hero is coming, hope is coming, weeee!  Jhon Woo's obsession with close up shots is at an all time high.  I have never seen this much close up shots in my life.  ""Slow motion arts"" are horrible, it took tom cruise half a minute to pick up a gun.
This music [stunk].  The only music that's listenable is the intro music.  Sound effects are horrible.  Guns, bullets, cars, mortocycles hurts my ears.
The final battle scence is very boring.  If you really want to watch good fighting, go see crounching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that movie doesn't have a dozen ""slow motion art"" to slow down the action.  Plus, in CTHD, battles were shot from one or two prespectives, thus satisfying like an opera, unlike in MI@, in which the battle were shot from a dozen different angles and were edited a hundred times, and the final product was Tom's facial Gallery.",992995200,3,2020,4.49041095890411

820901,4,6304233965,"Memorial Day weekend is traditionally when a huge summer blockbuster hits theaters and causes people to line up for hours just to watch stuff blow up. This year was no exception, as the eagerly anticipated Mission Impossible 2 opened to hordes of people wanting to see Tom Cruise dangling from a cliff and, of course, blowing a lot of stuff up.
Before diving into this feature-packed DVD, be warned that M:I-2 is a very different movie than its predecessor. Where the previous movie was more of a mystery with a little action tossed in, M:I-2 is a straight up popcorn movie and fits the summer blockbuster profile nearly perfectly.
Mission Impossible 2 is a strange sequel. It doesn't make any references to its 1996 hit predecessor, and the only returning characters are Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Luther Sickell (Ving Rhames).
The movie opens with a theft of a deadly genetically engineered disease known as Chimera by a group of terrorists lead by a former IMF agent turned bad (Dougrey Scott). Of course, the only person who can stop him is Ethan Hunt.
Ethan teams up with again with Luther, and gets help from an international thief by the name of Nyah (Thandie Newton). Throughout the course of the mission, Nyah gets infected with the Chimera and Ethan must then get the cure, which is known as Ballerophon.
If all of this sounds familiar, its because the story is just so cookie-cutter. We've all seen the good agent/bad agent thing before in Bond movies (Goldeneye anyone?), and the whole ""genetically engineered virus in the hands of terrorists"" angle has been played out in movies such as The Rock.
Which brings up one of the biggest problems with the movie - the plot (or lack of one). Many people complained how the first Mission Impossible was ""too complicated"" and they didn't understand it. With M:I-2 they made a ""story"" that is so simple to understand that the dialog and plot insults anyone with half a brain.
But despite the plot problems, there are some very cool action sequences and Ving Rhames is always awesome no matter what he is in. There is one scene late in the movie (track 14 on the disc for those who want to jump right to it) where Ethan Hunt escapes from the villain's HQ on a motorcycle that is simply one of the best action scenes in any movie this year.
M:I-2 is one of those films where you just need to check your brain at the door and strap yourself in for tons of action.",992131200,9,2410,4.6069767441860465

820974,2,6304233965,"I read some of the reviews complaining about the close-ups, and since I saw the movie months ago on VHS, I had sort of forgotten about them....WELL, now that that painful memory has been dreged up, my present disdain for this movie has escalated, and my rating of it has declined.  Thanks to Woo's ""artful"" imagery, this movie's ratings have fallen as low as Romeo Must Die and Flubber's for me.  I am saving a ONE star for something nearly lethal, but I am fortunately clever enough to never view anything THAT  bad....
How I hated the close-ups.  And I LIKE fashion magazines, photography, detail, art, etc...but how those close-ups irked me.  I literally began hollering out in annoyance whenever a new one sullied my TV screen, and I really thought there must be an end to them, the producer must realize he should of removed them.  But this was not the case...we still get to see them at the end of the movie.  If I recall correctly, Woo said something about focusing on the complexity of the human face....great, but just HOW complex is ONE person's face, especially in the time span of two stinking hours? Thandie Newton's pores will haunt me 'till the end of my days....",991353600,,1178,4.607655502392345
820975,3,6304233965,"One thing's for sure: this isn't Brian DePalma's Mission: Impossible.  This M:I was directed by John Woo, famous for Broken Arrow and Face/Off, which means lots of slow-mos, lots of fancy-pants flip-kicking, and lots of miraculous, one-handed gun shooting.  I'm not sure whether I like John Woo's style for M:I or not, but DePalma's was more realistic, more emotional, more interesting and in my opinion, better all around.  However, the fact that Woo's style does not fit Mission: Impossible does not make M:I2 a bad movie.

All gripes aside, M:I2 is a good movie, especially for what looked like a mindless action flick compared to the first.  The plot is (disappointingly) simple: Tom Cruise reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who is tracking fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott.  Hunt is trying to recover a fatal genetically-engineered virus which kills whomever it infects within 20 hours.  Ambrose has stolen both the virus and its antidote for financial gain, 37,000,000 to be exact.  In order to find out Ambrose's plans, Hunt sends his ex-girlfriend, Nyah Hall (whom he has already fallen in love with...and slept with), played by Thandie Newton.  Personally, I think the romance between Ethan and Nyah was totally unneccessary.  It didn't add much to the plot and it seemed very generic.

At first I didn't like the fact that you know who the bad guy is, until the infiltration scene, where Ethan must sneak into the building where the virus is being kept and detroy them.  I realized then why they did it.  You see, Ambrose had been Hunt's impersonator (this isn't a spoiler, we find this out early in the movie) and because he know Hunt's way of doing things, it creates a spy vs. spy scenerio where one is always one step ahead of the other one.  You never know who's going to come out ahead.

What M:I2 lacks in sophistication and emotional substance, it makes up for with great action and suspense.  This comes as no surprise, because that is what John Woo is best known for.  The hand-to-hand(-to-flying-kick) fight scenes were really intense.  Just when it looks like Ethan's winning, his opponent manages to turn the tables on him, and vice versa.  This worked well especially in the final battle.

Woo does overuse use his slow-mos.  There's at least one every five minutes.  It's almost as if the movie wasn't long enough so he decided to play it in slow-mo.  He does use them appropriately however, and they do create the effect he was going for, but they do get a little irritating after a while.  His use of colors is a little techno-ish.  They are always bright and vibrant no matter what's happening in the movie.  He does occationally separate colors to set moods, like blue lights for suspense and things like that, but for the most part the movie is very colorful, certainly a contrast from DePalma's infiltration scene, where everything was black and white for a neutral effect.

The music, by Hans Zimmer, was a bit excessive.  Also, I didn't like the techno-metal score alone, but again, it worked very well for Woo's style.  I prefer Danny Elfman's more soothing, emotional, percussion-driven score from the first movie; but I will admit, I am a bit biased since Danny Elfman is my favorite composer.

And I can't write this review with out mentioning the chase scenes, which were some of the most exciting I've ever seen outside of a James Bond film.  The scene in the beginning where Ethan and Nyah are playing cat-and-dog in their high-class sports cars was intense, especially since they were on on windy cliff-side road and there were actually civilian cars for them to avoid.  The motorcycle chase at the end wasn't as original as the train scene in the first M:I, but it was easily just as exciting.

All in all, this is a great movie.  It has a great plot, great action scenes, and enough surprises to keep on your toes.  I missed the intricate plot twists like in the first M:I, and I didn't exactly walk away from the movie in awe, but it held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Some of the lines were kind of corny, especially Ambrose's, who is basically your run-of-the-mill bad guy, only with some foresight; and as I mentioned before, the romance between Hunt and Hall was useless and hardly integral to the plot, the movie would have worked fine if their relationship remained professional.  These things aside Mission: Impossible II stands alone as a fun and exciting film which doesn't disappoint...as long as you don't try comparing it to the first.  I only wish Anthony Hopkins had had a bigger part in the film.

P.S. There are a lot of great bonuses on this DVD, along with the typical trailers and music videos, there are also many ""making of"" videos, including in-depth documentaries on every major stunt (99% of which Cruise did himself...the movie is worth watching just to see the actor do all his stunts, including the scary knife-to-eye scene).  Also, as has already been mentioned before, there is the very funny Mission: Improbable from the MTV Movie Awards.  (Ben Stiller loves making fun of Tom Cruise, I guess.  He did a parody of the first M:I at another MTV Movie Awards)

The only complaint I have is the rating on this film. If this were rated ""R"" I definitely could see myself giving this 5 stars in this version. The cinematography was mind blowing.

If you speed up all the slow motion scenes to normal speed, I'm banking on the movie being, say, 20 minutes long.
Yep, John Woo is back proving that a good film is about 400 bullets to kill one guy and every single trigger squeeze has to be captured artistically so that you can see the little hairs on the guys finger blowing in the wind caused by a superb motorcycle spin.
It's visually stunning...and unfortunately detracting from story and character development.
As Ethan Hunt lays out the possible evil plot behind Chimera and Ving Rhames asks if it really could be that simple, Ethan Hunt replies, ""Why not?""  I was sitting in the theater hoping, ""Please don't make it that simple.""
But it is and there are absolutely no plot surprises or twists beyond the ordinary.
Oh, and the dove...there it is again, Woo, I just don't know HOW you do it every single time.

However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.
The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.
Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.  Anybody would've been able to pick up on this...

I'll admit I wasn't exactly a very big fan of 1996's release, Mission: Impossible and I found myself wondering why I had bought myself tickets to the sequel while I was squirming around, waiting for the movie to start. Well, as it turns out, Mission: Impossible 2 is an example of a film that stylishly surpasses it's original, and it was well worth the money I paid.
IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorist headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of an international thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) of whom he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save his love interest who has already become infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.
The story is a bit on-edge, but, hell, who cares? You'll be having so much fun that you won't even notice the small flaws! The cast all get really involved in Mission: Impossible 2, especially Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton who light up the screen as two hip, adventurous go-getter's slowly falling for each other.

True, it was criticized by both audiences and critics for its supposedly confusing plot but the way I see it, good spy thrillers keep the audience guessing instead of revealing everything in the first 10 minutes.  But if MI1 suffered from too much plot, the opposite problem exists with MI2.
What little storyline there is here is utilized solely to propel Tom Cruise from one elaborately staged action sequence to another.  To director John Woo's credit, some of these scenes are breathtaking.  My favorite is the car chase between Cruise and Thandie Newton's jewel thief/love interest. This isn't a high octane chase as much as it is a tango dance with souped-up automobiles.
One can understand why Cruise wanted to make this ""Mission"" a little more audience-friendly and Woo was clearly happy to oblige.  But one of the film's biggest failings actually lies with those same action sequences.  Some of the fight scenes are so over the top they can't be believed.
Call it post-""Matrix"" fallout if you will but I'm a little tired of elaborately-choreographed fight scenes where the heroes perform feats of strength and acrobaticism that are impossible for anyone who isn't from planet Krypton.
You can accept that Keanu Reeves' Neo is able to leap horizontally 50 feet through the air while also firing his automatic. This is because a film like ""The Matrix"" establishes early on that most of its action takes place in a virtual world where normal laws of physics do not apply.  You CANNOT accept that Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt can leap 10 feet vertically from a motorcycle moving at nearly 100 miles per hour and collide with the villain without sustaining injury because MI2 clearly is supposed to take place in the real world.  In the real world, you try that, you die.  Pure and simple.
As for Woo, it's time to concede that Hollywood has spoiled him.  As enjoyable as this film or say ""Face/Off"" may be on a surface level, stack those films up to his Hong Kong movies like ""The Killer"" or ""Hard Boiled"" and they don't even come close.
MI2 is ultimately like most of Woo's Hollywood output, slick and fast-moving but devoid of complexity and emotional depth.
As for the DVD, on a purely technical level it looks and sounds great.  It's also loaded with enough extras that fans of the film will probably consider it a must have.  Most notable, is the hilarious sketch comedy sequence from last year's MTV Movie Awards and featuring Ben Stiller.
The huge box office this film earned pretty much guarantees there will be an MI3. But next time Cruise and whoever he picks to direct will need more than pyrotechnics to accomplish that mission.",983145600,,2739,4.781779661016949

This is a good thrill ride and all but i've seen the plot too many times.  I don't get how anyone wouldn't understand it.  Some Einstein look-alike makes this virus and this antidote to cure it and is trying to make some bucks with Demeetree (Tom Cruise- Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Top Gun).  But he is tricked by Sean Ambrose, another agent, and Ambrose steals the virus and tries to make 30 million pounds.  So Ethan Hunt, (Cruise), goes out to stop him in high speed, ulitmate shootout form.  VERY DIFFERENT from the first Mission Impossible- it's not as confusing and there's a lot more action in the movie...  The plot which is old news like in such film's as Wolfgang Petersen's OUTBREAK and Steven Seagal's THE PATRIOT is about some virus that can kill you within 20 hours and has slipped into the wrong hands- Boring- if only it would have been different in that aspect of plotting it would have nearly been perfect.  The acting was great- but i woulda liked to have seen some in place of Ambrose's girlfriend- or Hunt's girlfriend-(Either way) should have been someone talented like Nicole Kidman or Patricia Valasquez, maybe even Jennifer Lopez or Carrie Anne Moss (Trinity- The Matrix).  The directing you could tell was far more different, from Brian DePalma (Mission To Mars) to John Woo (Face/Off, Broken Arrow).  Woo for this film used this slow motion a lot which for a few scenes was just too long like when the two (Hunt + Girl) were spinning in there cars over that cliff-like road.  That kinda stunk.  The masks- how would hunt know to bring all of those and everything- like at the near end when he was in that cave place underground and was facing Ambrose's ally- it really caught me in the theater when I found out that really wasn't Ethan Hunt that died.

 Period.
 I watched it on DVD along witgh a friend of mine and all we were both yawning about 20 minutes into the movie; this continued until the end.
 My biggest compaints:
 - John Woo's obsession with slow-motion shots.  I hate them.  And in this movie, they are a dime a dozen.
 - The excessive use of the flesh-mask...  Three or four times the darn thing got used; and by the second time you can already tell that they guy is wearing it.
 - Story is bland at best.
 - Action is so-so at best, only high point was motorcycle chase at the end.
 - The end sucks.
 Notice how I am not complaining about how ""fantastic"" or ""unbelievable"" this movie is...  When I watch something called MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I expect it to be unbelievable, so that was not a problem for me.
 I would also like to state that I liked the first one quite a bit.

821256,3,6304233965,"In future John Woo should stay away from 3 things:
1. BAD SCRIPTS - I actually enjoyed face-off. I think that if John Woo could get a script that got the audience emotionally involved as well as making them think, he could still make a few more good films.
2. EGOTISTICAL ACTORS HE CANNOT CONTROL - I have a feeling Tom Cruise made a lot of the decisions to do with this film. John Woo's job may have been just to make Tom look as good as possible.
3. LOVE STORIES - John Woo has a very strange idea of romance. The idea that the car chase was supposed to be some sort of courting ritual(explained on the DVD) made me laugh. I just think he should stick to pure action. The way he handled the romantic subplot really hurt this film.
He also needs to stop the doves/overblown shootouts/face masks/excessive slow motion. Someone doing a parody of John Woo would make a film very similar to this.
I borrowed the DVD from a friend. If you liked M.I.2 you will love the DVD. It has many behind the scenes interviews and the highlight for me was the hilarious ""mission improbable"" segment involving Ben Stiller. Unfortunately I did not like M.I.2
Some of the things said by the people involved with this film made me shake my head in disbelief.
John Woo: ""I wanted Tom to jump through the flames but Tom said Ethan Hunt was not Superman. He wanted him to be realistic"" [LOL] (Kicking guns in the air? Jumping off motorbikes? FACE MASKS?!)
Stunt Coordinator: ""Tom did the jump at the beginning a number of times until it was perfect"" [ROFL] (I suppose he dodged real machine gun fire while he was at it)
Stunt Coordinator: ""Tom has done more jumps than 99% of stuntmen"" [ROFLOL] (No he hasn't)
The amount of Cruise worship on this DVD actually made me sick. Yes I know he did his own stunts. I know it was dangerous. You don't have to tell me EVERY SECOND!!!
If you don't mind any of this you will enjoy the DVD which has as many extra features as a M.I.2/Tom Cruise fan would want...",982281600,4,1977,4.360433604336043

The plot is straight and simple, and the fight scenes are not up to the standard of John Woo's previous movies. One note is that John Woo is not good at directing hand-to-hand combat scenes. And the gun battle in this movie really sucks. If you are a Woo's fan, then go see other movies like A Better Tomorrow 1&2, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and Face Off. If these are unavailable, then go watch The Replacement Killer and Broken Arrow. For those of you whimps used to watching sissy movies like The Titanic and The Wedding Planner, you might find it ""action-thrilled.""

Actually, this shame must be rated zero, but music is nice and 1 is a fair rating for it. Everything is not interesting at all. Visual effects, fights and races are poor; the plot is more than ordinary and it is terribly realized. Acting is awful if it is possible to speak about acting in this movie. I would rather prefer seeing a good Quake-player (or some other gamer) playing instead of entertainment of this type.

Tom Cruise playing in a role worthy of Arnold Shwartzeneger, and yet he could have done a better job. They is plenty of action for the thrill seekers, but not enough suspense for the jaded. It turns tired, a little long and the plot seems like it should have been done in a 30 minute TV show.  Shockingly the best part of the movie is shown on the previews. But the previews don't show enough. The seen I'm talking about is when Tom Cruise throws his sunglasses, and they explode, then it goes into a mindboggling  cool opening sequence.  Mission: Impossible 2 isn't all bad, it has a sexy heroin, a very neat cameo by Anthony Hopkins and some very nice action sequences. But since it is a plot that doesn't seem good enough for one of the biggest hits in years, it all falls flat.

But when we talk about James Bond movies we can say that they should be with only tricks and the destiny of the world depends on one man.  Tom Cruise is a very very very good actor but why did he do that??? Or maybe he haven't read the script before saying YES?  Who knows. I can say just one thing - this movie is not for pleasure to watch, it is for giving our money for such low-grade movie.  If you want to buy this - think.

Anyway, when thinking of the title Mission Impossible certain things come to mind, things that had NOTHING to do with this movie.  The stunts and special effects where well done, the only problem was they where used very strangely and un-realistically.  Can someone tell me what the car chase between greasy Cruise and the girl was about?  Couldn't figure that one out either.  Anyway, this movie came to mind as more of a sequel to Heavy Metal 2000 then to the original Mission Impossible.

The DVD - the DVDs really bad. It has an alternate opening sequence (wow...*yawn*...and it's even almost the same as the one used), a ""Mission: Improbable"" MTV parody (good...), ""It Disappears"" Metallica music video (who cares?), ""Making of"" featurette (15 minutes of nothing...and JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES!), ""Mission: Incredible""(s'ok, but...), and a more detailed look at each of the stunts in ""Impossible Shots"" (this is the only thing really worth the DVD buy). Oh, and a boring as hell...no, an even more boring than hell John Woo commentary. How many times did he say the word ""love"" in the commentary? 30 times? 40? He wanted to emphasize that he wanted to do a love story, and he emphasized that fact so much that even a dog could have figured that out after a while listening to him, without, obviously, the dog knowing a word of english.

The result... a sequel that became more successful than the original, a rare case indeed.  Upon viewing the movie, one might be able to easily contrast the opening sequence to that of a 007 James Bond flick.  Which was a trend that continued throughout the rest of the movie.  But what is painfully clear is that Woo was more interested in exhibiting special effects than he was in making an enduring American classic.  The movie is chalk-full of explosions, elaborate sets, and vehicle stunts.  And the acting to action ratio leaves much to be desired for the typical film critic.  And in spite of anticipating a generic mission that involves danger, bombs, villains, and heroes... the plot of the movies becomes lost in a sea of over-played special effects, terribly fictitional stunts, and just good, old-fashioned bad acting.  Yes, it's easy to tell which movies will support the weight of rotten tomatoes when the soundtrack for the film draws more attention than the mediocre movie itself. (see ""The Bodyguard"")  Making a sequel that receives critical acclaim and praise is not only a difficult task.

I saw MI:1 because of Jean Reno, Jon Voight, and Ving Rymes. Even with these great actors that movie was tripe. MI:2 continues in that vein. Despite my dislike of the first, the critics were kind to this picture and I, mistakenly was lead to believe that this plot would be, if not good, at least decent. I was mislead. The plot is so overblown that it moves off in paths only tangentally connected with the opening premise. The acting, even Rymes, is horrible and the directing is even worse. John Woo may have had a distinct vision when he burst on the scene, but it is now apparent that it is myopic at best. All his calling cards are here: Black leather coats flapping in the breeze, pigeons fluttering in the background of action scenes and enough slow motion to choke a horse. If that were not bad enough the fight scenes are so overly dramatized that, even a Woo fan, has to wonder how ordinary humans with stand this type of pounding and live, never mind with no visible ill affects.

I think, from the first scene with Hunt ( the one in which he's climbing mountain with bare hands ) the producers warn you: "" DON'T expect nothing worthwhile here. Don't try to see possible things heres. Just be prepared for  journey of impossible deeds, lousy acting and a new ""action-hero"" that's marked to last just this movie.""

Obviously, this movie was meant as a money-making blockbuster, without much thought of art involved.  The best I can say about this movie is that it had great cinematography.  But other than that, the idea was simple--throw together an edgy, electronic score by Metallica and Limp Bizkit, a lot of gravity-defying action, Tom Cruise, and an anorexic love interest meant as eye candy, and WHAM!--You've got yourself an assured summer blockbuster.  Everyone goes home rich and happy--even though Tom Cruise is undoubtedly rich enough, and this movie turned him from a once-respectable actor to a definite sell-out.
And the sad thing is that I know Tom Cruise can act.  I saw him give an excellent performance as the anti-hero Lestat in ""Interview with the Vampire.""  In my opinion, that was his best performance ever.  Anyone who reads Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles knows that Cruise captured Lestat perfectly.
But Cruise undoubtedly made so much money off MI2 that they'd have to pay him, like, a billion dollars to star as another character like Lestat.
FYI: Thandie Newton, Cruise's love interest in MI2, played the servant girl Yvette in ""Interview with the Vampire.""
Anyway, the movie is okay--a definite guy movie with a lot of action, but don't expect anything else.  The DVD, of course, has everything on it--including the video to Metallica's ""I Disappear.""  As a Metallica fan, that's the best thing about it in my opinion.",980812800,,1593,4.936329588014981

It seems that the producers had to fill up the time in the movie and therefore put in a terribly long and nonsence scenes like the opening sequences and also scenes in Sevilla.

They eliminated almost all of the M:I team, leaving only Vinge Rhames to play 10 minutes on the screen.  This is a Cruise-fest, plain and simple.  And Woo's insipid filming technique, which for the most part does work in martial arts only movies, falls on its face.  In a story that is supposed to be somewhat believable, we watch Cruise and cast complete hilarious stunts including a midair chest to chest impact of Cruise and baddie going at about 60 mph (120 mph impact) each.  Please!  And the repetitive use of rubber masks, upon rubber masks became boring, trite, and downright stupid after awhile.

The music selection for the film was done quite well.  The move from the more traditional Mission Impossible music, to music by Limp Bizkit and Metallica added to the action scenes.  I wish they had the Orchestrator of MI:2 do a commentary on the music and the process of choosing it (like on the Matrix DVD).

The movie, while having very little in the way of new plot elements had many fantastic (albeit, totally unbelievable) stunt sequences. The movie is not a serious movie, and thus this detracts only slightly from the story. The story although not really all that original seems to flow along well.
I watched the movie to escape reality for a couple of hours, and it was a pleasant diversion from the real world. The characters seemed to be well acted, the performers were easy on the eyes, and the environment was so far fetched that it was unrealistic. The perfect keys to a good escapist movie.
The stunts while not really all that realistic, were dazzling and contributed to the aesthetic quality of the movie.

The story, I have to admit is a little bit weak, but this doesn't change my opinion about the movie. Not every movie needs to have a great storyline. The acting is not bad at all.
Some actions scenes are very good, that'a what you can expect of the director if u know his movies.
Mission Impossible 2 is pretty different to it's predecessor. I think that Mi2 is great but aimed for a younger audience like age 17 or so.

Some people probably think he is a real cool action hero sort of guy, when actually he is a complete idiot for first off climbing without ropes and second climbing up a wall of sandstone, which is one of the weakest and most likey to break sort of rocks.

The DVD edition has a lot of great extras including the making of many of the ""impossible"" stunts.  The sound and picture quality as expected are much better than the VHS edition and really makes for a greater viewing experience.  I myself really enjoyed this movie and found that the story was much improved over the first movie.
The character developements in MI2 are a considerable improvement over the first installment and the story moves along nicely.  The stunts are mind-boggling and the special effects are great.

To do so he recruits the love interest, who's just a dewdrop of beauty on the screen, Ving Rhames, and an Aussie bloke who flies the helicopter a lot.
That's pretty much it for the plot, but what do you expect from a movie that had the stunts mapped out and the actors hired BEFORE the screenplay was written??!! Yes, the stunts are tremendous. Even more so becuase the actors did a majority of them on their own. The first act, and even half of the second, are good, and the movie had promise, but the second half is ALL fight/chase/shoot-em-up scenes. Or closeups on Thandie's hair blowing slowly around her face while she looks sad. (And the one white dove cracked me up!)

It fell short of its mark, because I wanted to be entertained, but part of that entertainment means I get to escape *into* the movie.

It used many of the same plot points of my favorite Hitchcock film 'Notorious'. A woman of questionable moral standards is sent in a top-secret mission to use her charms with a criminal who happens to be an old intimate acquaintance. There is a car chase together to heighten the...tension between the government agent and the saucy heroine. There is a poignant scene at the racetrack.

For those who liked the first ""Mission Impossible"" , be warned that this is the worst of all sequels. MI2 only shares the first two letters in common and that's about it ( and oh yea, Ethan Hunt too ). Besides that, forget Mission Impossible as you knew it. Ethan Hunt becomes a one man army (a la Rambo in Rambo III) instead of being a member of an elite team of highly trained, well-coordinated crack spies.
The plot ( huh? ) is terrible and the movie is merely an excuse for special-effects pyrotechnics with the sound-engineers having a field day.
On the positive side ( yes ! there IS a positive side ) the sound effects are great and the aural space is indeed very impressive. The visual effects are nice but nothing to write home about. And the scene in which Ethan brings the bike to a ""one-wheelie (yippee)"" halt and turns around to blow the car ? A definite must-avoid scene ... it reeks of machismo and nothing else to it. And the one in which he jumps sky-high of a speeding mobike ? The lesseor said the better !

821774,1,6304233965,"John Woo, the fanboy revered action director with a touch so subtle and vision so pure one could only take him to be the second coming of Renny Harlin, helmed this horrendous follow-up to Brian DePalma's often maligned, though simplistic, original Mission:Impossible.  Back again is Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, but he's no longer playing a super-spy.  No, he's now a gun-crazed, martial-arts skilled one-man army with bad hygiene and the incredible ability to jump off moving motorcycles while suffering nary a scratch. Of course one Hunt factor does continue, he picks some bad girlfriends.
So with Woo directing, what do we get?  Possibly one of the worst films of all time.  Woo does his usual, packing on the two-fisted, guns blazing slo-motion ""ballet"".  Of course if we put the whole film at regular speed, this turkey would barely clock in at over 30 minutes.  So Hunt's got guns ripping up everything in sight, Thandie Newton is along to play the lover interest and there's a barely there plot about some nasty little virus. Personally, I'd like to get my hands on the virus from the movie and take a healthy dose before witnessing this thing again.
Oh, by the way, it's got doves too.  A must for Woo.  We know how peaceful he really is.  And how he's trying to make a deep statement.

However, even the most spectacular action sequences in the world can not make up for shallow minded storylines that seem to be a symptom suffered by many big-budget Hollywood productions these days. Rumor has that the original uncut version of Mission Impossible 2 turned out to be over 3 hours long and received an R-rating. This was not very marketable during the extremely competitive summer season where young teenagers made up the mass majority of the movie goers. Another fact was that John Woo was not involved with the editing at all. So you eliminate a hour worth of original storylines and cut out every sequences showing any sign of blood from a John Woo film. What do you have left?

821778,1,6304233965,"This movie is a tad stinky.  But of course, this is coming from somebody who thought the first movie was a complete waste of time.  Well, the bright folks in Hollywood decided to torture us again, with an equally poor effort.  Like the first one, the first hour has absolutely nothing going on, except for a lot of hi-tech mumbo-jumbo and cloudy character development.  You have to put up with a lot of pointless developments, bad acting and a plodding script to get to the action. By the time the far-fetched final motorcycle chase comes along - which seems to last for aeons - you're too bored to care about the exciting and innovative stunts.  The stunts certainly are impressive, and there are a lot of things that go 'boom', so fans of stupid movies may be satisfied.  But stunts and exploding rubble make not a good movie.  The humourous cliche-fest of a script ('the clock is ticking') and terrible acting are tolerable in a movie of this nature, but there are too many other things wrong with this movie.  The Thandie Newton character is dull, cardboardy, and doesn't have much to do other than look pretty or violent, and the same can be said for Tom Cruise, and basically everyone else.  In fact, only the Anthony Hopkins character (who gets about 2 minutes of screen time) is remotely likeable.  In short, you find yourself not rooting for anyone, because you don't care about anyone.  Also, the plot can be compared directly to swiss cheese - as in, it's full of holes.  And the incredibly boring first two thirds of the movie are just dreadful.  The thin plot progresses in a lethargic and confusing manner.  The deadly virus theme - which has been used a million times before - is a pretty lame excuse for flying motorcycles and exploding things.  And really, the exploding things aren't all that exciting after the five-billionth movie.

821873,2,6304233965,"John Woo's ""Mission: Impossible 2"" represents much that is wrong with commercial moviemaking today.  Though proficient on the levels of technical expertise, visual design and state-of-the-art special effects, the film emerges as little more than a multimillion dollar exercise in cold efficiency, devoid of humor, suspense and, above all, heart.  Thus, while countless superior films - films that attempt to make some connection with the reality of the human condition - languish at the box office, ""Mission: Impossible 2"" and other films if its ilk play to packed movie houses.  Do people really enjoy this film, or are they just suckered into believing that any film that is sold as an ""event"" picture - particularly one that stars the ubiquitous Tom Cruise - must by its nature be worth the price of admission?
""Mission: Impossible 2"" features an opening credit sequence that proves that just because something ""can"" be done doesn't necessarily mean that it ""should"" be done - a warning filmmakers should heed now that, with computer graphics, virtually every situation imaginable has become possible to visualize convincingly.  We are reintroduced to Cruise's spy character as he is climbing up the face of a sheer cliff sans ropes or cables.  Although the shot looks absolutely convincing from a technical standpoint, we simply cannot believe that anyone in his right mind would be doing what he is doing - or even if those actions are themselves within the realm of physical possibility.  From its opening note then, ""MI 2"" informs us that it is not concerned in any way with making everything we see believable and involving.  As a result, we tune out, detaching ourselves from the events on the screen, becoming disinterested bystanders of a trite espionage scenario that, for all its visual finesse, is strangely lacking in creativity and passion.
The first ""Mission: Impossible"" film, made in 1996, may have been a monument to incoherence, but at least it half redeemed itself by offering two spectacular and unforgettable action set pieces - Cruise's dangling marionette act and a mano-a-mano fight atop a roaring, supersonic train.  The sequel offers no such action scene equivalents.  The car chase early in the film between Cruise and the sexy thief he is pursuing is a yawn-inducing bore compared to the ones in the exciting ""Ronin"" from a few years back.  The shootouts are equally undistinguished, far below par for a Woo film.
Like many films that rely so heavily on special effects and action sequences, ""MI 2"" never exerts the slightest effort to flesh out its many characters.  One would expect that a writer with the talent and track record of Robert Towne (he wrote ""Chinatown"" for heavens sake) would at least be able to provide some character dimension even within the tight confines of the action genre.  Unfortunately, all the characters emerge as cardboard cutout figures, substituting coolness and slickness for personality and depth.  Cruise and Thandie Newton generate zero chemistry in the romance department, and John Polson seems woefully inadequate as the film's main villain.
If you must check ""MI2"" out, by all means do.  Just know that there are a lot more interesting, much less heralded films out there more worthy of your time and attention.",977529600,30,3282,5.087523277467412

For those of you who DID like the movie (and I did enjoy it) and are wondering if they should get the DVD I would say 'YES'.  Unlike so many other DVD's that are suppose to be packed with extras (*cough* X-Men *cough*) MI:2 has a nice variety of extras that I actually found interesting and enjoyable.  Especially interesting are the behind the scene looks at how they filmed the numerous action sequences (some of which were much more dangerous than some of these reviews have given the actors credit for).  The addition of the MTV skit with Ben Stiller is great.  Picture and sound quality is top notch (check out the review from 'Widescreen Review').  Despite the number of bad reviews I know people liked the film (it did gross over $200 million domestically) so for those people I say this high quality DVD is one to add to your collection.
BTW, I'm not dissing the X-Men movie, just the quality of extras on the 'Special Edition' DVD.  The movie is top notch and there is no question it is far better a movie than MI:2.",976752000,16,1163,4.478672985781991

822005,1,6304233965,"Never one to be close-minded, I expose myself to all sorts of movies.  I really do enjoy action movies when they are done well and have an interesting story line to go with them. MI2, however, does not fall into the aforementioned category.  The characters were flat and bland.  When Cruise's female love interest injected herself with the virus, I frankly could have cared less if she was rescued (not that I ever was at the edge of my seat with suspense as to how it would turn out - that was sooo obvious) or not.
As for action, I wasn't even impressed with that.  The beginning opens with Cruise's rock climbing scene, which was panoramically impressive.  After that, however, there is little, if any, action until the very last portion of the movie.  Since the story was so inane, I would have at least expected more action sequences.  Instead, the movie bombards the viewer with lack luster dialogue and plotting.
If you want to see a really great, action packed flick, I strongly suggest X-Men or Gladiator.  X-Men is non-stop fun with interesting characters that you both want to see more of and care about.  Plus, X-Men's Hugh Jackman gives a great performance - I strongly suspect that he will follow in the footsteps of his other Australian predecessors, Mel Gibson and Russel Crowe, which in turn leads me to segway into Gladiator.  This is a movie of epic scale that manages to be emotionally uplifting while at the same time satisfying even the most carnage-craved fanatic.
My suggestions - skip MI2 and go buy either X-Men or Gladiator, both of which I gave 5 stars.  If you still need a strictly action-based flick, however, I suggest The World is Not Enough - you can't go wrong with Bond - that is James Bond.",976665600,2,1727,4.629508196721312

Of the 2, I liked ""Gone.."" better than ""Mission..."". A big part of why this didn't do it for me was there were too many dead parts. It needed more action. Also, the widesreen really took away from this as about a third of the screen was taken away from top to bottom. I couldn't believe just how narrow it was.

The begining is action packed but seriously slows down for about a half hour with a lot of story build up.

822008,4,6304233965,"Where Mission Impossible 1 was much smarter, Mission 2 is much more of a gun toting, feet flying, jumping, kicking, punching, stabbing, heck-of-a-fun-movie. But, John Woo is the true star here. Tom Cruise is not an action star. He's not. Even in the clip from the trailer, where Cruise does a roundabout kick, and on the way up, his cheeks trailing the rest of his face, Tom looks out of place. But John Woo actually makes him look good.
The acting isn't that great. Ving Rhames is great, reprising his role as Luther. His entrance to the movie picks up the pace and the entertainment. Newcomer Thandie Newton, playing Nyah, Cruise and Scott's love interest in the film, works well. She's absolutely beautiful, with the looks of Catherine Zeta-Jones. She also is very believable at points. But Cruise is very disappointing - his smile looks more like a ""I'm going to be making 50-80 mil"" instead of a real smile. In many areas, he didn't seem to put in any effort at all, and then at times overacted for the film. The guy has come of Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, two acting-based films, and to make the switch to action is tough.
But in the end, who cares? It's John Woo - who is truly a genius. His movies never fail to entertain, and guess what? Mission: Impossible 2 delivers. If you're a fan of the intellectual spurring of the first film, with twists at every turn, and vice versa, this film won't be your favorite.

Both have heart-stopping action, outstanding special effects, great soundtracks and some funny, goofy scenes as well. Don't watch these movies if you are looking for deep character-development or dialogue film. Don't even question some of the aspects of the plot, you don't do that for James Bond, either, right? But if you are ready to get your popcorn and go for a fun ride, you will not regret getting MI or MI2. Since MI2 came out after ""the matrix"", a true watershed movie for special effects, even the most sophisticated action afficionados will not be disappointed. There are some really eye-popping scenes in this one. The cinematography is outstanding, not only in the well-advertised Australian scene, but throughout the movie. Tom Cruise does well again as Ethan and we are happy to see his friend Luther back as well.

There is no way I am going to buy this movie because it offers absolutely nothing new to the Action/Adventure genre, which recieves much of this multitudinous waste. The plot, if it can be called that, has to do with the Chimera virus and its possible release into the human population, which would kill millions. The characters have about as much depth as a pancake, the action sequences use too much slow-motion, in an overt attempt to cash in on the success of the previous year's ""The Matrix."" Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, in the last film he was into finesse, but now its guns and using the same ninja manuevers over and over again. The final battle also attempts to generate the electricity of ""Speed,"" whenever you think the villain is dead, he jumps back up to keep fighting. There is another scene with the lead actress just standing on a cliff, as if she will commit suicide. The camera goes to Cruise mindlessly killing Aussie security guards, but the camera comes back to her half a dozen times, for about 30 seconds each time, before the helicopter comes. It made me want to walk out. If you enjoy movies with a bare-bones plot, cardboard characters, and slow action sequences, this is one for you. But this overrated junk will be coming to a bargain bin near you soon, to be replaced on the shelves by others of its kind, movies to be forgotten in a year.

822101,2,6304233965,"MI2 is an okay film. It has some very good action sequences, especially at  the end, all covered pretty well by John Woo's direction (although, unfortunately, his slow-mo  style becomes a parody of itself). The scenery and set pieces are nice, adding to the international feel of the IMF  organization, the kind of diversity we see in  Bond films.
But it's very disappointing, especially considering how  inventive the Brian DePalma original was (can't beat that ultra-fast bullet train finale). It's kept from being great  for many reasons. First of all, having a full-fledged romance plot between Cruise and Thandie Newton was a bad  mistake. There are no scenes that develop the characters of Ethan or Nyah, it's just extended from the isolated, spur-of- the-moment sleeping scene. Therefore, there's no point in extending it to the length it is. It would've been better  to keep the ""romance"" on the level of the temporary eloping that James Bond always engages in. At least  then it wouldn't interfere with time that could be spent on action.
Second, the film is denied so much potential from  the fact that it has to be a PG-13 film. Action films are just better when there aren't these restrictions placed  on how much you can show. As it is, MI2 suffers greatly from being a PG-13 film, because it's not satisfying seeing  the action like this: (1) Ethan shoots his gun, and (2) it cuts to a guy falling down- you never see where the  bullets go. You never actually see them enter anyone. This is such a huge mistake on the filmmakers' parts.
More on the  action: I was surprised at how little action there actually was. There are two brief scenes at the beginning (the  plane crash and the short car chase), and then there's a long, barren stretch of about an hour before we see any real  action again. Where's the balance? There's  a big, 15-minute action finale at the end, and I'm all for that, but at  least sprinkle some smaller sequences throughout the rest of the movie.
Furthermore, the action itself is good,  quite good at times, but nothing original or special. Sometimes it got repetetive, and other times it even ripped its  prequel off, like when Hunt descends down into a building on a rope, thus mimicking the security-room break-in scene  from the original. The best sequence of the film is the final fight on the beach, and even then, it never reaches  the level of great. That martial arts kickfest tries to be a fraction as entertaining as a typical fight in The  Matrix. Take that scene, multiply the content and complexity by five, and speed everything up, and you have one of the  many typical fights in The Matrix. (This proves yet again that creating good action requires just as much thought and effort as creating a good story.) My point is, in a time when action films are really staking new ground and becoming  so unique, uninspired action like the stuff in MI2 just isn't special enough anymore to be called really good.",976233600,3,2960,4.7009708737864075

822106,4,6304233965,"Let's get one thing straight right away: ""MI:2"" is NOT ""Citizen Kane."" In fact, it isn't even ""Die Hard.""
But it is one heck of a fun, entertaining movie, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's worth the price of admission for the trademark John Woo flourishes (doves, flapping capes, hyperkinetic action, etc.) alone, not to mention the stunning action sequences.
Tom Cruise returns as superspy Ethan Hunt, whose rock-climbing vacation (an eye-popping set piece if ever there was one) is rudely interrupted by his new unnamed boss (played nicely by Anthony Hopkins).
Hunt's mission is to stop a renegade former IM spy Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from selling a lethal virus on the black market. To get to Ambrose, Hopkins tells Hunt to find the renegade spy's ex-girlfriend, Nyah (played by a radiant Thandie Newton). Of course, Hunt and Nyah fall for each other but not before they try to run each other off a winding mountain road (it's a John Woo flick, folks...deal with it). And of course, Ambrose infects Nyah with the virus, making Hunt's mission two-fold: to save the world AND Nyah.
Unlike the original ""MI,"" which featured so many strange plot twists that it was often difficult to follow, the plot of ""MI:2"" is so transparent that you can see what'll happen about a half hour before it actually happens.
But the point of this film is not plot or characters, though it gamely tries to beef up both; this film is about action. And ""MI:2"" delivers in droves on this count, with about a half-dozen of the best action set pieces you'll ever see.
The only set piece that doesn't succeed grandly is one in which Hunt is dropped into a biotech company's heavily defended high-rise laboratory. The scene works, but it tries too hard to one-up the now-classic scene from the first ""MI"" film in which Hunt is suspended over a CIA computer.
The principal actors all turn in solid action-style performances (especially Cruise and Newton, whose chemistry is tangible), and the requisite summer-movie lines (""That's why it's 'Mission Impossible,' Mr. Hunt,"" Hopkins tells Hunt) are all present and accounted for.
Overall, if you put your brain on autopilot for a couple of hours, ""MI:2"" will reward you with a superior action experience.",975974400,,2236,4.902374670184696

822219,5,6304233965,"I believe that you should set your mindframe to the movie you are going to watch.  For example, you shouldn't start watching M:I-2 (which looks like some horrible emoticon experiment gone awry) expecting Oscar-caliber performances...unless the Oscar is for overly-exuberant use of pigeons and slow-mo.  Go in expecting to be taken on a great ride, which is what it does...quite effectively.  If you wanted to exercise your brain, try explaining how the 6-foot-something Dougray Scott can pass as a 5'9"" Tom Cruise.  See what I mean?  So just sit back and enjoy.
The plot of this movie is much less convoluted than the original, which makes it easier to enjoy.  I wasn't missing half the movie trying to figure out the imponderables like I was in the first one (Is that chick from Emmanuelle going to get nekkid?  I wonder what that stick of gum tastes like??)  This is an old-fashioned spy movie.  Minus most of the gadgets.  This one ended with a stronger feeling of finality, unlike the first one, which kind of left the door open for a reunion between Ethan and Luther.  I liked that maybe Ethan is off on a permanent vacation.  Lord knows he's earned it.
Now for the disc itself:  There are three or four behind the scenes vignettes all based around how they did the stunts.  Not too much about the story, cast special effects in these BTS shorts.  This is no mistake.  Word is that the action scenes in this movie were written first, and the story evolved around the action.  Ironically, George Lucas was playing skee-ball one day and had an idea for the Death Star chase sequence.  The rest is history...
One of the funnier shorts I have seen on a DVD is Mission:Improbable from the MTV Movie Awards.  In it, Ben Stiller plays Tom Cruise's stunt double/stalker.  I'm a huge fan of Ben Stiller, and to see him send up Tom Cruise, with the help of Tom Cruise and John Woo, was in itself worth the purchase.  The commentary is a little thin, and I would have liked to hear what Tom was thinking during the filming.  But, on the bright side, the disc does include the video for Metallica's ""I Disappear"".  The disc should have included the video for Limp Bizkit's ""Take a Look Around"", since it wasn't released here in the states.  I have seen the video via newsgroups, and it would have made a nice little bonus addition.
After all is said and done, the question arises:  Should I buy this DVD?  The answer: yes.

One reason for this is Woo's style. It's weird that bullets never ran out in Hard Boiled and it managed to be quite delirious and original. One can sense the angst and uncertainty of early 1990's Hong Kong where its citizens seemed to ignore the looming imminence of the Chinese takeover of the city.
Yet when Cruise's character almost never gets a scratch, he seems too cocky. Too smooth, and therefore nothing we can latch on to identify and feel for the hero. I found the toys in Toy Story/Toy Story 2 more charming and believable. They seem better ""actors"" than Cruise can ever be in this forgettable movie (only this -- he is a great actor in his other films).",975196800,,916,4.660493827160494

The only thing I really enjoyed in this film was the action and the plot throw ins with the masks(which were actually cheesy if you think about it).
 The first movie was much better than this one and I hope you decide to enjoy that one instead of this. I personally feel that Tom Cruise should quit the whole Mission series (incase you haven't heard there are plans to make many more) and find something he would do good at.
 Here is a little tid-bit: You may want to skip to the last half hour- 45 minutes of the movie as this part is where all the action and plot takes place. This is one part of the film you will definitley enjoy. The other parts of the movie are just horrible. To understand what's happening read the Amazon provided summary.
 So in conclusion, if you are looking for some action scenes, this is the way to go. For a great story, don't bother with this one. I reccomend you rent this one and buy the first Mission. That's basically it.

I have not seen the original MI series and I assume the first MI movie in 1996 was close to in story. I am a huge fan of the James Bond films, to which they are my kind of style and liking. As you see the second film in the MI series, MI2 follows more of a James Bond storyline, rather than the original MI movie. I am a fan of John Woo and really like a movie he produced in 1997 called ""The Replacement Killers"" to which MI2 has a similar style.
The only reason I like this movie so much is because of the James Bond type action, the awesome music and special effects. I liked the slow motion action also.
The aspects that turned me off were the fake over the top action scenes, like the spinning cars, the sportbike scene from the on road chase to the off road chase, the fake wheelies in the dirt and the fake joust scene.",975110400,,945,4.005291005291006

The ""Plot"" consists of the following - Cliffs; sexy people falling into bed with eachother immediately after meeting; car chases around cliffs; dangerous viruses; girls in sexy dresses; violent acts involving fingers; mucho MI-style mask-action; motercycles; blowing up a few things here and there; helicopters; a jealous villian; and some matrix-wannebe fighting action. In no particular order. The rest of the movie is just an attempt to link the previously listed. Oh, and don't be fooled into thinking this movie co-stars Anthony Hopkins!

So it is hard to explain what all of this movie was. I love John Woo; Dougray Scott is a fine actor, Thandie Newton is appropriate... it's just that THERE WAS NO SCRIPT WITHIN 5 MILES OF THIS MOVIE. I still find it amazing that with all the considerations made for various things in a movie, the script seems to be the thing least paid attention to. What did this movie cost, $100 million+? It had to, because it looked great and that's it. I don't expect the equivalent of MI1, but this is plain terrible. MI1 was EXCELLENT- took a while to figure out what was going on, but very fun! This one uses the things that made the 1st one cool, like the realistic masks, etc. to cover coincidences or plot holes... very dissapointing. Like I said, I didn't expect much, but when you put talents like that together and this is all you come up with, you should rethink paying actors and directors that much, and concentrate on what should matter the most- the story. I long for the days when Woo was brilliant (The Killer, A Better Tomorrow) and his flashes of brilliance since then (Face/Off). Oh well- as you can see from mine and the other reviewers, if you enjoy Armageddon and the like you'll enjoy this... if you're looking for good direction, solid acting and a great story, STEER CLEAR.",975024000,,1530,4.371929824561404

822473,3,6304233965,"John Woo disappoints again (another previous disappointment being Broken Arrow) by making a big budget movie with a very slow and badly realized screenplay. This movie seems like it wants to be too many cliches, and departs so much from the original Mission Impossible concept as to be deemed a James Bond wannabe. It does have some of those awesome action scenes one would expect from Woo, but many of these, unfortunately suffer from pointlessness.
The relationship between Cruise and Ms. Newton is a nice addition to the story as it brings a very human aspect to Cruise's character development, but it detracts from the orginal concept, making it look (dare I say it again), more Bondish, in it's one main super character and a babe against the world type of formula. This makes for relatively slow and boring cinema, and it's a true shame. It is a shame to see so much talent wasted on this script (i.e. Anthony Hopkins in a very poorly written cameo).
In conclusion, this movie doesn't know what it really wants to be. The first movie was better executed with a better script. If you enjoy John Woo films, it certainly has the shots and the action although more pointless and limited than in other films of his. I recommend that you rent this movie first, and if you really must have it, then buy it.

822475,3,6304233965,"The purpose of this silly action adventure flick seems to have been to live up to its name.  The malarkey they want us to swallow is so utterly impossible that this film could easily be one of the most laughable movies of 2000.  Fifty bad guys shoot 10,000 bullets at Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with automatic weapons, but never even wing him.  Hunt, armed only with pistols, kills a bad guy with every bullet he fires, often killing them three at a time while somersaulting through the air.
John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) is a veteran of action adventure films and his expertise in this area is evident throughout the film.  It contains stupendous action sequences throughout, though I thought Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into Jackie Chan was a bit much.  Woo also chose some breathtaking locations and the photography was first rate.
Ronald Moore's (Star Trek: Generations) story was an utterly unoriginal excuse to keep half of Hollywood's stunt actors employed.  The screenplay by Robert Towne (Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, Armageddon) was even worse.  The dialogue was wretched.  If one more character ripped off his face, I would have stomped the DVD.
The acting was nothing special.  Cruise really had nothing intelligent to say or do, so the best I can say about him is that he was in great shape and showed us what a good athlete he is.  Thandie Newton (Beloved) was initially very dynamic and sassy, but by the end of the film, she was reduced to a quivering jellyfish.  Dougray Scott was fair as the villain, but lacked the wickedness to make him truly hateful.
This film did well at the box office grossing over $200 Million, a testimonial to the American public's inherent need to see stuff blown up without the burden of having to lug their brains to the movie theater.  I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Woo's fabulous action sequences.

Tom Cruise plays one of his best acting roles ever in Mission Impossible 2 playing the role as ""the good guy"" against ""the bad guys"" in this action packed thriller.
I was just blown away from the special effects and time the producers put into this film to create such a great movie.  The fight scenes are phenomenal and as real as you can get them, the explosions are as great as you can ever see, and the gunshots and wounds are so life-like.  Sometimes I feel like I'm actually there.
Tom Cruise probably already knows that he did an awesome job but he should be congradulated once again by a long-time fan.  He got into his character so much in the movie that I just couldn't believe that it was him.
I honestly have to say that any action movie fans or just fans of great movies should really check this one out.  Not only does it feature a great cast and great crew, but it also features spectacular special affects and fight scenes.

MI2 though suffers from a deplorable lack of action, at least early on anyways. Although, it's visually stunning at times, there's really nothing here to grab you. I thought this film had very little to do with the Mission Impossible series, and more resembled John Woo's normal action films. The main problem with the film, is that it's main character, Ethan Hawke, played by Tom Cruise, gets involved in a very, long and drawn out relationship with his female co-star. The film spends far too much developing the relationship between the two, and far too little time giving us action. I also don't agree with the other reviewer's opinion that the first Mission Impossible was forgettable. The first film was much truer to  the series, and was a very sharp, smartly-acted film. It had  action when it was necessary, within the bounds of the story. I'd highly recommend the first film, and only recommend this one, if you need it as a companion piece.

I was so disappointed in the first film that, if not for the fact that John Woo directed this one, I wouldn't have bothered to see it.  John Woo's involvement pushed this movie to heights it wouldn't have achieved otherwise.  The stunts were amazing, the motorcycle chase scene was one of the best I've ever scene, and the fight scene in the end was full of tension and realistically done.  Mr. Woo has taken the action genre to new levels of achievement.  He is THE director to watch these days and you can see his influence in other films.
The one shortcoming of this film was bad dialogue.  Not that the film was filled with it, but rather that there were scenes here and there where the characters didn't seem to interact naturally and the dialogue was way too cheesy.  Now, I have no problem with cheesiness when it's intentional (a la Schwarzenegger movies), but it really had no place in this film.  Other than that, this film was a blast to watch.

The concept of the Mission Impossible Force as a a TEAM of members, as in the original series and the first MI film, has given way to creating just another star vehicle for actor/producer Tom Cruise.  This movie exists SOLELY to present a buff Cruise as Mr. Action-Movie Hero, a territory he is relatively new to. As with many movies like this, plot and plausibility are secondary to whiz-bang effects and stunts.  A good script is the foundation that any good movie with staying-power is built upon.  Instead, MI2 is built AROUND something.  It is just an action showcase, that's all.  That this movie topped the box office in 2000 is testament only to the drawing power of Mr. Cruise and the public's diminishing discriminatory taste in intelligent script fare.  The popular media will have you believe that moviegoers' tastes are becoming more demanding and sophisticated, but you'd be hard-pressed to find evidence of that in this latest stunt-fest. But is the DVD worth renting?  Sure, for the DVD extras, behind the scenes technical goodies, and the MTV spoof.  But the movie lacks any elements to warrant ownership's repeat viewings.  Sure, the stunt setpieces are over-the-top and fun, but the minute a new movie can top it (and rest assured one will) MI2 will be just another discarded excess of its time.

But John Woo needs to A. stop using two guns in every movie, B. stop having the characters diving in mid air while they fire both of those guns in every movie, and C. don't use a wash out overrated actor like Tom Cruise for an action flick.

822690,2,6304233965,"I love John Woo.  From Hong Kong movies such as Hard Boiled and The Killer to his American movies, the man has proven time and again that he is an absolute master of the action movie genre.  Unfortunately, that's why he was a poor choice to direct a Mission Impossible movie.
I grew up watching the original television show and this movie had virtually none of the elements that made the series so successful.  The only ""Mission Impossible"" element found in this movie was the use -- over use, actually -- of the molded masks.  There was none of the fun that I found in the television series present in this movie.  I'm talking about how the IM team would manipulate the bad guys into bringing about their own downfall.  The IM team never carried guns.  They didn't race around on motorcycles.  They worked behind the scenes, quietly doing their job then quietly driving away as the bad guys took the fall.
As action movies go, this is a good movie.  Not great.  Not Woo's best by a long shot, but it's still a good action movie.  But it's supposed to a Mission Impossible movie.  And that's where it falls on its face.  And that's why I scored it low.  Of course, if that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably enjoy the movie.",973728000,,1230,4.457399103139013
822691,3,6304233965,"Let's start out with the good points about ""Mission: Impossible--2."" First, the action scenes are superb: director John Woo has created a stunning visual symphony of color and energy. It's high-tech violence infused with the beauty of poetry. Second, the special effects are flawless. And third, Tom Cruise's hair and physique look great.
Beyond those good points, I found ""M:I-2"" to be one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2000. This is a beautiful but hollow shell of a movie; the film's visual power does not make up for the moral and emotional void at the film's core.
The biggest problems involve Ethan Hunt, the character played by Cruise. Hunt's romance with the film's female lead (competently played by the exquisite Thandie Newton) is utterly unbelievable; the script gives no indication why these two should become so passionately devoted to each other. Is it just hormones? And Hunt's motivation with regard to the film's mission is similarly missing. Why is he so dedicated to his task and his organization? Does the Impossible Missions Force have a great benefits package, or what? The film's failure to go beyond the characters' surface actions left me feeling cheated.
The story (involving terrorists, a biological weapon, and a love triangle) is competently written, but I've seen the ""James Bond"" producers do it better before. And the rest of Hunt's team is pretty much wasted; ""M:I-2"" is an unrepentant star vehicle for Tom Cruise (as if the film's poster didn't give this away). By eviscerating the ""Mission: Impossible"" teamwork element, the film's producers do a disservice to the memory of the original television series.",973728000,,1656,5.159851301115242
822692,1,6304233965,"Wow.  Amazing.  I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was.  There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's ""relationship.""  I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought ""action"" sequences.  And I know this because I heard them HOWL when Cruise emoted his laughable dialogue to Newton before parachuting from inside of the building.

822694,3,6304233965,"John Woo set out to make the second in what I suspect will be a long running francise of films with modest intentions.  1) Dumb down a plot which he saw as unnecessarily intricate, 2) up the action and 3) create warm, more compasionate charcters.  And he's succeeded on all fronts, but to the detrimate of the film.  You needn't be worried about getting lost in the story because it's so simple that even a child could navigate it's way through, which in light of Congressional discoveries could've been their (Paramount's) target audience all along.  There's a good side to this though.  After all, how often do you hear a gasp followed by ""Plausible!"" instead of ""Cool!""  The rational is that by relaxing on the plot we can justify settling in and enjoying it for what it is - a popcorn movie.  This way the director doesn't have to concern himself with the little details, like 'why does Tom Cruise put on a pair of sunglasses amidst an intense action sequence?'  The story (or what there is of it) revolves around Ethan Hunt and his beautiful accomplice (Newton) who's mostly just window-dressing, though I think she was intented to be more.  Hunt's nemisis - an Aussie baddie hot after an Ebola-like virus and it's cure, in hopes of extorting millions from a chemist who plans on unleashing the virus and cashing in on the antidote.  It's sounds deeper than it really is, as in one scene it's asked if it's that simple and a smirking Tom replys, ""Why not?""  Why not indeed.  After all, the story's just an excuse for death-defying stunts and good old-fashioned white-knuckle action the likes of which we haven't seen since the Die Hard trilogy and that Mission: Impossible 2 has - in spades.",973641600,,1696,4.654362416107382

Instead we get John Woo's tired slo-mo action sequences, a ludicrous storyline and Cruise walking through the movie knowing it's critic-proof. Sure, the action stuff is fun, but I expect more out of Mission: Impossible. I expect my brain to get a workout. Not so, here. Predictable at every turn. And not a subtle frame to be found. This is a John Woo film (Brian DePalma was accused of ""facelessly"" directing the first film....EXACTLY; as this one should have been!). Woo's fingerprints are all over this thing.

I  enjoyed Tom Cruise more in this movie han I did in the first, he sems so much more alive in this movie, he barely did anything in the first movie. This movie does have it's problems though, it takes way too long getting started and a few parts of it are confusing. But once the film gets going it is an acion assault.

Opening with a bang, the movie did slow down quite some bit into the first hour.  I also, due to my own fault, saw a rather late veiwing of the film.  This probably hindered my enjoyment factor, despite being a fan of director John Woo.  However, with the relaese of the MI-2 DVD, I have a new found appreciatiion for the piece.  The movie, although long and a bit slow at imes, delivers cinemattic action the likes of which have never been seen before.  The stunts, gimmicks and unparalelled action sequences are more than entertaining, they explode across the creen.  The John Woo stamp is obviously here.  The ballet of slow motion sequencces that Woo is known for encite such emotions as romance, drama, intensity, and desperation. Seeing MI-2 was much more entertaining this time around.  In adition to the film, the bonus materials are well delivered in their menus as well as being interesting.  As we are repeatedly convinced of Tom Cruise' willingness to put himself in danger for the sake of his work, the bonus chapters take us through some of the film's over the top action sequences.  This provides a treat to those fans of both Tom and the combination of unique stuntwork and film making.

Keeping the plot simple in this one and putting on the action pack was the key in this one all along.  I mean, the choice to use John Woo is defn gear toward that.  I think the film was worth the $$$ and I bought the DVD fresh off the press.

Besides the movie there is about an hour of supplimental material which gets into the making of the film and how some of the action sequences were accomplished. There is also a commentary track included, which is really nothing special. As for the movie itself, Paramount did a great transfer. The audio and video are perfect, no flaws whatsoever. I won't get into the plot of the movie, as many other reviewers have done so already, but my personal take on the film is that I absolutly love it. John Woo brought his patiented style into the film which makes this movie excel. Awesome action sequences which I have never seen anything like before make this a great movie to watch over and over.

The plot is simple and straightforward, unlike the somewhat labyrinthine story in MI1, and Woo does a nice job of building up toward a torrent of wild, insane action sequences.
Tom Cruise is impressive in his second bout as spy, Ethan Hunt, heir apparent to the role of Mission Impossible team leader. Most impressive about Cruise is that he performed about 90% of his own stunts in this film, many of them quite dangerous. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the all-time great chase scenes in movies. The DVD version has a nice bonus feature showing how some of the more wild stunts in the movie were put together. Really fun stuff to watch if you're interested in the process of making movies. The DVD also has commentary and a ""Making of MI2"" featurette that round out the package.
Ving Rhames returns as computer hacker, Luther, and the beautiful Thandie Newton plays Hunt's femme fatale.

True, the motorcycle chase is well done, and the mountain climbing at the beginning is handled with the skill of a master, but I still expect more action from Woo.  The acting is passable, Tommy doesn't quite cut it, his hair flailing all over the place.  Thandie Newton is sexuality personified, she is wasted also in a nothing part.  The plot is dumbed down to a painfully basic level.  The trademark masks are used as a primary plot device, which is disgraceful and manipulative.  The movie drags in the middle very badlyThe last thing is the action sequences.  Woo employs his standard two gun approach, and the pigeons are used to a ridiculous excess.

Having said that, MI-2 is a brilliant film. My first reaction to seeing MI-2 was to go out and buy all of director John Woo's movies, because even if they are even a tenth as good as this, then surely they must be well worth watching.
MI-2 has a very subtle thematic structure for a move of this genre and Woo seems to keep all the metonyms and such like as subtle as possible, so as not to detract from the narrative drive. So, top marks for direction and production.
Also, top marks for story and scripting because all the characters down to the smallest were three dimensional and totally believable. You come away from this movie really wanting to meet its protagonists because you feel you know them so well.
While MI-2 is good in that all the characters are very well drawn and acted, although Ethan Hunt is a very different character to the one in the original MI movie. Gone is the loveable American boy grown up, and in its place is a James Bond wannabe - and this grates a little because with one Bond around, we don't really need another. Part of Hunt's charm in the original movie is his vulnerability, and this has been sadly expunged in this sequel in favor of a macho stereotype that, whilst well played and realized, has now become a cinematic clich.
All these niggles to one side, this is a very good action/adventure romp that leaves out all the Cold War legacies of the original and aims instead at the vagaries of capitalist greed verses the good of the human race. It really races along from one brilliantly conceived scene to another with a smoothness that does its makers credit and there are also some very good stunts and special effects that don't dominate the plot.

Except for the opening airplane scene, there was NO action in the first hour.  The second hour has action, but John Woo decided to make 90% of the action in SLOW MOTION!  I was shocked.  I go to see an action movie and it is all in slow motion.  Some of the scenes with explosions in the background could have been in slow motion and it would have been fine.  John Woo decided to make every punch, kick, and gunshot in slow motion, like the audience wouldn't be able to follow the action.  Since the first hour was slow, the slow motion in the second hour made the film feel even longer.
The Sixth Sense was really slow in the first hour but it ended up being one of my favorite movies.  The second hour was really thought provoking and I was intrigued to figure out what happens next in the second hour.  MI:2 did not have the same effect on me.  This movie was awful.

The storyline is watered down.  It's about a virus that was engineered that is lethal enough to kill you in less than two days or some sort like that.  The storyline did get predictable and tries to be emotive, but just doesn't cause anything.  The movie is like a James Bond movie, Tom Cruise meets a hot girl and that's about it.  The movie tries to be shocking and wants you to predict what will happen next, but watching 20 minutes of the film, most people knew what was coming to them.  The movie tries to shock you with people having on masks of other people, then have artificial voices.  That act gets pretty lame.  It gets very tedious and monotonous after people do the mask 'n voice trick about five times.
The action sequences just aren't cut out compared to the other movies this summer, and the martial arts sequences are very dull.  One of Cruise's stuntmen do all the martial arts techniques, but still, they aren't very well choreographed, and very unrealistic.  A real martial artist wouldn't do the fanciest of moves that are just a waste of time (like going, do a rainbow side slash kick just to knock a gun out of one's hands) then all the other dumb attacks aren't cut for a real person.  If someone spent two seconds to do a back flip, the guy would just shoot you before you even get your feet up unless your attacks are direct!
The shooting scenes are also pretty lame.  It's like a move in, shoot security guards, then hide behind a wall then shoot than do one dive and shoot.  No, it doesn't compare to any other movie.
The sound f/x are fairly good and so are the f/x, but Mi2 took a perfectly good actor and director and made them look like crap!",972518400,6,1862,4.4035087719298245
822987,5,6304233965,"OK, Ok, if you've read the reviews (both professional and customer), you've probably heard all the negatives...bad plot, cliches, predictability, etc. etc.  And perhaps all of that is true; for example, who could buy a love story that starts out with the hero and heroine making googy-eyes at each other while one of them is dangling periously over the edge of a cliff?  But, it seems to me that the whole point of a good action flick is the ACTION, isn't it?  I mean, if you want to see great plot, multi-dimensional characters and the like, I direct you to the various films in the Merchant Ivory genre.  If you like good action, stylish film-making, and overall bang for your buck, MI:2 is the way to go.
  What MI:2 may lack in the complexity of its plot or character development, it more than makes up for it with the complexity of many of its action scenes.  This corroborates the rumor that the screenplay was written around the action ""set pices"" already composed by Cruise and Woo. (And really, shouldn't a good action movie revolve around the actual action scenes?)  From the opening of the movie, the famous rock-climbing stunt, you can tell that the action pieces in this movie will be something different.  And from the panoramic and breathtaking rock-climbing scene to the  motorcycle-chase, cum shoot-out, cum hand-to-hand combat finale, you can't help but be riveted by John Woo's unltra-macho, ultra-stylistic direction.  Even a scene involving flamenco dancers is turned into macho eye-candy by Woo's deft film artistry.
  And sure, Woo often riverts to the same formula: slow-mo shots, standoffs where all the characters seem to be pointing about a million guns at each other, a strange fetish for doves and pigeons....  But, darn it, all these things look good!
  Another, quite refreshing, positive in this movie is that the female character, played by Thandie Newton, is not a simple foil character, made to be used sexually and then killed off to make way for another potential conquest.  Instead, she actually makes a unilateral, powerful decision at the movie's climax that affects the entire outcome of the movie.  Show me a Bond pic where that happens!
  All in all, despite its flaws with plot and character, MI:2 delivers the best of all cinematic guilty pleasures: a good couple of hours on the edge of your seat, and some virtuoso, fun-to-watch film-making.

The sequel is very good, but it just couldn't live up to the success of its predecessor. This is probably because of minor irratations throughout the movie. First, with Tom Cruise playing a bigger role behind the cameras this time, a lot of the movie is focused on him. M:I-2 also uses slow-motion way too much. Some of the action scenes would have been way better if it weren't for this. But enough criticism, I didn't give this movie four stars for nothing.
The storyline in the sequal is very unique (and not nearly as confusing). The premise is simple; a bio-medical engineer has created a super-virus that only he himself has the cure to. When the virus gets into the wrong hands, it is up to Cruise to prevent a world-wide breakout. Woo did a stellar job on the action scenes in M:I-2, as well. Everybody will also be relieved to hear that the storyline is a lot easier to understand this time. There are still a lot of old fasioned plot twists this time, but they are explained much better.

823150,3,6304233965,"The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.
MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.
The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effect that is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.
All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.",971827200,,2423,4.665882352941177

So my expectations for MI-2 weren't that high, but I was positively surprised by what I saw. Of course, let's be honest and let's forget about the story line ... we all know this movie is definitely not Oscar material. MI-2 is simply a hot action movie with excellent stunts, great cinematography, a powerful soundtrack and the movie comes across as a high-budget John Woo action picture. Sure, it appears that they heavily borrowed from all kinds of other action movies, but the compilation resulted in a fun and nerve-racking action adventure and experience. I liked it better than the last couple of James Bond movies. For action fans and for those who like a thrill ride with great stunts, it's definitely worth watching.",971568000,,814,4.780141843971631

Tom Cruise returns as secret agent Ethan Hunt, a spy that even James Bond would like to have as his partner. The films' opening sequence is to say the least, breathtaking, as Hunt climbs on top of a mountain to receive his new assignment. From this point the action begins. John Woo, as usual, employs his slow motion action sequences, those which are similar to his 1997 classic ""Face Off"", starring John Travolta and Nick Cage. The Dolby Digital soundtrack will knock your ear drums, to say the least your stereo system will receive a good workout. Although there are some scenes which could have been left on the editing room floor, such as the sappy love scenes, which really des not belong in this kind of movie. Watch for an exciting chase sequence near the film's conclusion involving motorcycles, which takes the film to a new level. In conclusion the film earns four stars for its' clever action sequences and a plot which is easy to swallow, considering the near IMPOSSIBLE to follow plot of the original.

823155,4,6304233965,"Every summer, there's one movie that defines the entire season and sets the pace for the rest of the movies coming out after it. Mission:Impossible 2 was without a shadow of a doubt, THE movie of the summer of 2000. Why? There were two main attributes that stood to make for a formula that would rival the best in action. Cruise and Woo. Granted, nobody ever really thought of Tom Cruise as someone who could be much of an action hero. But John Woo? If you don't know this name by now, go try to build an igloo in Jamaica because sadly, there's no hope left in the world for you.  Enough about the summer thing, let's talk movies. First, was the movie any good? That depends on what you're talking about.  If you mean good in the sense of story? Sadly, the answer is no. The plot is weak, takes too long to explain, and...to put it honestly...stretches credibility to the point of exaggeration. Nyah Hall(Thandie Newton) falling in love with Super-agent-who-kind-of-reminds-me-of-James-Bond-and-never-dies Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) after one incident? wow, I wish I had those kinds of powers over women like her. While the idea for the virus and it's cure was a good idea, you somehow felt that the story was selling itself short. You would walk out of the theater and think to yourself ""That was it? All Ambrose wanted was money?"" I guess money really is that big a deal, especially the amount that they were talking about. However, why all the fuss over something like a few (billion) bucks? Kind of puts things in perspective.  Now if you mean was the movie was good in the sense of something that made your eyes scream for a break, your ears cry because of the glorious sounds that surrounded and engulfed you, and just blew the rest of your senses out of the your head, then I guess the answer would have to be a rousing yes. This movie had everything that's expected in a big summer hit. Guns (John Woo, need I say more?), beautiful women (not pretty...beautiful), a rockin soundtrack (c'mon, who didn't like the Limp Bizkit remake of the theme), a hero who didn't know the meaning of the word die, cars (Porsches and Audis, I must have been dreaming) and of course who better than John Woo to piece this puzzle together. Is there anyone who doesn't like Woo's cinematic style sweeping landscapes, slow-motion sequences, bullets whizzing by your head, people spinning and revealing their 2ND gun that was tucked into the back of their pants, white doves flying past the screen, and...well...need I go on?  People criticize this movie as having a weak plot. Then again, who cares? This was a summer flick. It didn't need a strong plot to carry it. The producers saw to that. Did Armageddon, Men in Black, or Independence Day have plots that was fantastic? Not particularly. A giant rock falling towards earth, a giant cockroach that wants to rule the universe, a giant spaceship full of aliens who blow up the white house. I guess they don't do anything small do they.  Now why would this review be called face-off 2? this movie drew a few eerie parallels to face off. The main villain who has the hero's face and gets to his woman, if only for a minute? The hero engaging in acts of insanity (remember Cage's esacpe from prison and Cruise's bungee jump?), Car and motorcycle chases towards the end of M:I2 and the boat chase in Face Off. Not too similar, but they do have their similarities.  In the end, the real question is if this movie is worth buying on DVD. Absolutely. Without a doubt, this movie has the guts and the  impact of a 300 pound rushing football player. Nobody cares what's in his brain or what the point of the entire story is, all they want to see is something fun, something exciting, something that takes them away from the realities of the world, if only for a few hours...and isn't that what the point of movies is?",971481600,,3843,4.585152838427947

In short - this movie was absurd.  The 'fight scenes' went on FOREVER (no, really - for EVER!), and it was all just very silly and rather pointless.

To see the brilliance of John Woo, check out Boiling Point and the Killer, two great movies with another great actor Chow Yun-Fat.  And most of the action from MI2 was from other Woo movies.  Not only did the final battle look fake, but the frantic and fast pace of Woo's other movies were missing here.

To top it all off, Cruise and Woo are obsessed with gunplay throughout the movie, something the producers and directors of the original television series INTENTIONALLY did not use.  They wanted their characters to THINK their way out of situations--Woo and Cruise just shoot everything until somthing works.

In one scene, Cruise searches for Thandie NEwton while the camera keeps cutting between him looking and a dancer downstairs in a village.

I didn't hope enough.  First, I'll start with the ""action"" scenes.  I saw 99% of them on the TV previews.  And they were all lame.  I don't know what Woo was thinking.  They were flat-out lame - worse than the Bond movies (which are dumb in my view).  The worse action scene was probably the beach fight, which was dragged out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay toooooo long.  And what is with Cruise kicking the gun out of the sand and into his hand, then turning around and shooting the ""villain""?  Lame.  Just lame.

Now we'll move onto the plot and acting.  What plot?  As far as I could tell, there was this virus and Cruise and the what's-his-nose-bad guy play this mind game with the anti-venum.  The dialogue is slow and poorly written.  The ""love"" story is quite lame.  The movie would have been better if Nyah would have shot herself while inside the laboratory.  But sadly, Woo was too dumb to make one of the good-guys die.  On the acting part, I thought Cruise actually did a decent job.  Everyone else was just lame.  But, I have a question: What were all the spies doing with Ausie/British (I really couldn't tell WHICH accent they were) accents?  The CIA is American - their men in the field don't have those foreign accents.
All in all, a lame, boring, laugh-able, ""action"" movie.  I was incredibly disapointed in it, because it made a mockery of the first Mission: Impossible (which I absolutely love).  Obviously, the complaints of those people who weren't smart enough to follow the first movie carried way too far into Woo's mind and into the directing of this film.

Mr. Woo and Mr. Cruise seems to try to be arty by having a white dove showing up with Cruise now and then. Of course the white dove is also filmed in slow motion.

The cinemotgraphy is of course beautiful, and put together in a sort of arty Jerry ('Con Air', 'Gone in 60 Seconds') Bruckheimer way. But the excitement is only really there for the first fifteen minutes, and the last thirty-five. Predictable it is.

823602,4,6304233965,"Hi, Everyone!

  Personally, I think the problem mostly made MI2 not to be a SUPER movie is the story.  The entire movie is no long like  a spy movie as Mission Impossible 1.  It has became an ACTION movie at all.  And it's too simple to be a Big Hollywood movie.

  Tom  Cruise still gave his best to MI2 as the past movies he led.  In MI2, he  did a lot dangerous action by hiself.  That happened because (I think) he  knew the story couldn't capture the attention of audiences.

  John Woo....I'm from Hong Kong and have been seeing lot of his movies  whatever he created in Hong Kong or Hollywood.  Yes, some of the action  looks similar to those in his past movies, but He is still the MAN who  create action sequences that lot of Hollywood top action directors couldn't  create.  For those American audiences, I hope you understand it's not easy  for a Chiinese director as John to direct a millions-dollars-production  movie in United States.  But I'm happy to see American people found  greatness from Hong Kong that's just a place as little as a tiny dot in  World Atlas.

  Anyway, I would say MI2 is a Good movie.",968716800,,1124,4.410891089108911

I wasn't impressed by the first Mission  Impossible movie but was hoping that John Woo would be able to bring some  of his inspiration and originality to that movie. The result is an  extremely predictable movie which spectacular stunts, hardly believable, do  not help to render even the slightest interesting. At least movies like The  Matrix have a plot (.) which justifies such stunts. Seeing Tom Cruise drive  a bike on its front wheel with one hand and looking in his mirrors to shoot  bad guys behind his back with the other is more than I can take. If he was  a product that you can actually purchase (!) then this would only just be a  commercial for it. It is way too obvious how big a grip he had on the  script and how much it limited Woo's ability to make a good movie. No  ""Carte Blanche"" here, Hollywood's rules have to be respected.

823746,2,6304233965,"I was very disappointed with this movie, though I admit my hopes were not high after the first one.  Some of the special effects were glitzy but the  action was poorly planned and the characters were poorly scripted.
When  people ask me why I pan this film, I have to bring up the motorcycle chase  scene.  We got bored in the middle of it.  A motorcycle chase scene has to  be pretty bad for you to get bored during it!  Furthermore, the  hand-to-hand combat was very poorly choreographed.  You can tell neither  Cruise nor his director has a good sense of how to make this believable.  Most trained combat elites can do a flying kick into someone's chest and  then land on their feet.  The spin kick seen in the previews was the  longest period of exciting material in the fight.  Think back.  That was  less than one second.
I was looking forward to seeing Thande Newton in  this movie, but was disappointed in that she has a shallow, stupid role.  The best part of her interaction with Cruise is when he goes to recruit her  at a party --excellent camera work creates a very intense focus between  them from across the room.  But from the moment they speak to one another  onward, the film goes downhill.
Finally, the strategic presentation in  this movie is miserable.  These guys couldn't pull off Mission: Easy if  they insist on looking like themselves in broad daylight during a dangerous  rendevous with an agent who has infiltrated a gang led by someone who can  recognize their entire crew...  Scenes like that and the climactic scene  where Cruise is racing an oncoming militia in order to save the world and  he's  moving  ....  at  ....  the  ......... speed  ..... of  ....  cold  ....  molasses  ...  were more than sufficient to ensure that I wouldn't  recommend this film to anyone.",968198400,,1801,4.592356687898089

This summer offering is just what the doctor ordered. Based on the hit 60's tv series (remade in the 80's ) , and a sequel of sorts to the  1996 blockbuster. I will be the first to admit that the 1996 film isn't the  better of the two. That film I thought was too silly to be seriously , but  the stunts and acting as well as Brian De Palma's direction was great. But  come on would Jim Phelps have really betrayed the team? The newest  installment in what is likely to become a film franchise is directed by  action master John Woo (""Face Off"", ""Broken Arrow"",  ""Hard Target"") , and features a silly plot that mainly serves as  the reason for all of the action. Ethan Hunt (a suave Tom Cruise) is  whisked away from his vacation in the mountains by his new boss (Anthony  Hopkins in an uncredited cameo) to assemble a new team. The mission should  he choose to accept it is this : Stop a fellow agent gone bad named Sean  Ambrose (Dougray Scott ""Ever After"") from getting control of both  a Virus and it's anecdote and selling it to the highest bidder. The team  Ethan Hunt  assembles to assist him  consists of three other people. An  Australian spy, Luther (Vingh Rames ""Entrapment"") returning from  the original and Nya a sexy thief  (Thandie Newton ""Besieged"").  The movie has lots of wonderful stunts which will please  the audience  immensely. One thing that I found amusing is how many times masks are used  in a scene in which suddenly someone turns out to be another cast member.  It is as if they have an unlimited supply of them. Another problem is the  silly story which could have been better. Oh well beggars can't be choosy.  Overall this Mission is successful just don't expect a 5 star film.

823750,1,6304233965,"Oh dear. There are so many things wrong with this film, I'm having trouble beginning.
Best to examine the origins of the plot, I suppose. Here we  have an obvious remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"".  However, while the great Al was a master of suspense, John Woo, for all his  charms as a director, surpasses suspenseful dialogue and slow panning  camera shots and arrives at pure boredom. This movie drags so badly you'd  think it was carry two tons of bricks up a steep hill.
Then the supposed  love story. I think it was intended to be between the Tom Cruise and  Thandie Newton characters. Hmmm. Really, I suspect the true love story was  between Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise. What, as producer did he get to say Hey  guys, for this film I'm going to sport a terrible haircut and have 81  million close-ups of me looking ""intense""? Puh-lease. The worst  of it had to be in the beginning, when he depicted Ethan Hunt performing a  self-crucifixion while rock climbing. Okay, he's supposed to be saintly, we  get it already!
And the action sequences. The movie definitely had it's  share of cool shots, but they seemed so overdone. John Woo's brilliance in  this genre is so strong it doesn't need such a high degree of digital  touch-ups. Finally, why bother to pay such brilliant actors as Anthony  Hopkins and Ving Rhames if you're only going to hide them behind lame  dialogue and uninteresting scenes?
I suppose there is merit in this film  for it's advertising scheme. Here's a franchise that is bound to attract a  loyal following despite the poor quality of the product. Just don't let the  slickness of the posters or the catchiness of the Limp Bizkit song fool  you, this isn't a good film.",968198400,12,1705,4.651006711409396
823859,1,6304233965,"About this movie! I remember seeing the ad's for this movie, thinking it really does look awful. They seemed to have abandon the old tv show's  formula, and replace it with this junk! When I went to the theater to see  this movie, I had no idea I was going to be watching the latest James Bond  film! It's hard to believe Robert Towne could have written such garbage.  I've heard people say the first one was confusing, which to be honest, I  can't understand why they say that, but if they thought that one was  confusing, wait till they see this one! There's such a lack of plot here,  that the same ""tricks"" or ""devices"" are played over and  over again, untill the point where I just couldn't take it anymore. Just  how many time did they want to work on the ""mask switching""!  It  must of happened at the very least 6 or 7 times. I can't understand how an  actor( if you can really call him that) like Tom Cruise can go from making  a great movie like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to this. And as for Thandie  Newton, I have some advice for her, before you start ruining movies like  Bertolucci's ""Besiege"" and this one, why don't you consider  acting lesson. And I'm only saying this for her own good, if she plans on  continuing making movies. Now for the directing. I've heard many many  people speak very high of John Woo. I've even heard some say he's one of  the best directors around. How can someone say that! When I think of great  directors I think of Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Scorsese, Truffaut,  Coppola, and many many others, but John Woo?  When I think of Woo I think  of him as not really a director, but more so a choreographer who can  sometimes setup some nice action sequences. And to be perfectly honest,  yes, this movie does have it's share of good action scenes, but I can also  say, that not all of them work, but that's only expected. There's no way he  could have made every single scene work, lets be honest. Besides the action  scenes there's one more things that saves the movie.

Does everything need a close up or a zoom in to  clarify things?  I can accept a movie that's unbelieveable at time, since  that's all movies in general, but the patronizing is too much.  Here are  two men on motorcycles.  Kill them.  It's easy because they have no other  weapon besides the motorcycle itself.  Conveniently, there are two bikes so  bad guy gets on one, and tom cruise (aka, James Bond) gets on the other.  Chase.

823863,3,6304233965,"Having built the pre release hype upto dizzying levels through numerous teasers and the fact that action meister John Woo was directing we were all  in for a bit of a treat.
I found myself being quite impressed with the  slick opening sequence, yep we've got ourselves a nasty piece of work bad  guy (Dougray Scott) who likes to make a scene by crashing a whole plane of  innocents into the rockies. Then we have the spectacle of Tom Cruise doing  a Peter Parker up the side of a sheer rock wall, so far so good. But then  things go a bit awry from then on.
I'm a big fan of John Woo, there are  few directors around who can direct action scenes with such visual flair  and inventiveness. Check out any number of scenes from 'Hard Boiled' or  'The Killer' and you'll have your eyeballs treated to scenes edited and  shot to perfection. With MI2 though the stunts seem to be just rehashed  partly from the original. For example the first film had Ethan Hunt  dangling from a cable in a CIA computer vault, this one has him diving from  a helicopter into  a vent. Bigger, as they say, isn't always better.  Other things that annoy are a lack of explanation about why Sean Ambrose  has gone totally loony. I mean, are IMF in the habit of hiring fruitcases  to be their agents or what!  Again, there's no indication of his  motivations or Hunt's and Ambroses previous relationship. I'm not saying  that there should be a huge chunk of the film set aside for explanations as  it's an action film first and foremost and not an episode of sunset beach.  A perfect thing to do would be do what Goldeneye did and have the two  agents on a mission together and have something tragic happen, at least we  could have been draw into the story a tad more.
Other characters in the  film seem to be totally sidelined, Thandie Newton's character happily hops  into bed with Ethan Hunt and is magically transformed into a 'Hunt Girl'.  Her task later in the film is to look willowy and defenceless until the  hero saves her from the deadly virus (yawn). Anthony Hopkins is criminally  underused, he's marginalised to a cameo role to add some form of gravitas  to the whole proceeding. Ving Rhames reprises his role of Luther Stickel,  the computer hacker, but again he seems to disappear into the background  with nothing more than a perfunctory back-up role.
Dougray Scott has a  rent-a-villain look about him, he sneers, he bullies and yes he kills  innocent people before breakfast. What made a nice change this time around  was that he wasn't a British bad guy (big sigh of relief), yes he's..wait  for it..Scottish! Remember Hollywood, the UK is full of loons (we're not  happy about losing the empire you see) Personally I'm waiting for is a  Welsh bad guy, that would be worth a fiver in anyone's currency.
What  really wound me up though was what made the series and in part the first MI  film cool, was the element of teamwork. It wasn't about just one person  doing the work, it was the IMF team battling the enemy. Not so here, Tom  does all the kicking ass (in slowmotion...woohoo) All I have for this are  two words...James Bond. I caught myself thinking anytime soon he's going to  say 'The name is Hunt..Ethan Hunt' , he did come close though on one  occasion. Added to all this there really are some howlers of plot devices.  Examples include, applying a face mask of an enemy henchman in a couple of  minutes, motorbikes that miraculously change tread without stopping and  best of all, flame retardent pidgeons (you'll know the scene).
Adding  all these points together I really felt let down by the whole MI2  experience. The film does have some excellent stuff in it and John Woo does  pull off some magic here and there but sadly he's having what appears to be  another bad Hollywood experience. The same thing happened with him on  Broken Arrow and Hard Target and it looks like much of the same here. I was  hoping that the DVD might contain an alternate cut of the film, but alas  there is no mention. In all honesty I'd recommend saving your money and  watching x-men instead, much better in every department really.

823867,4,6304233965,"I liked this film for what it was - an action flick, a fairly good action flick. Think Face/Off meets James Bond meets Kung fu, which reduces  originality. Still, I liked the film. It had the two things which make for  a good action movie - a great hero, and an awesome villian. What more can  you want? Cruise's fast attraction for Newton is a bit unbelievable but we  will forgive that. Cruise reminds me of Jan Michael Vincent in his Airwolf  series. Scott as the villian was excellent. There were wonderful action  scenes including the motorcyle chase which was a refreshing departure from  the usual car/boat/plane chases. Any movie fan would be glad that Woo has  shown The West what can be done with a motorcycle in the hands of  professionals. There were some obvious overdone scenes and the sound track  was also a bit heavy on the theatrical side. Otherwise, happy are we who  love good action. As for Ving Rhames' character, when will hollywood stop  protraying african americans as people who are most concerned about how  good they look, and who spend alot of time bragging about Versace.? Watch  the film, it is exciting.",967507200,2,1135,4.695431472081219
7865526,2,6304233965,"The worst Mission: Impossible movie rife with cliches and overacting.

Mission: Impossible 2 is a lackluster sequel to Mission: Impossible. John Woo did his best job to up the ante to no avail as Woo's direction pales in comparison to Brian DePalma's original film. Mission: Impossible 2 completely fails to capture the genre of the first movie's spy thriller, opting instead for a lame action movie.

The occasional cool shot is offset by hilariously over-exaggerated close-ups and goofy zoom in shots. The cinematography can be really intense, but constant quick cuts at the most inappropriate times with campy slow motion sequences take you completely out of the movie.

Script-wise, Mission: Impossible 2 is nowhere near as clever or original as the debut feature. There are few if any interesting twists with none of the political spy intrigue or intelligence. The narrative is as cookie cutter cliche as can be for an action movie. The plot is muddled while also being filled with plot holes. For example, when we see a character infected with a virus for 20 hours walking around fine, when the audience saw earlier in the film a person infected with the same disease visibly bed ridden once exposed for the same time.

Mission: Impossible 2 notably takes a distinctly more languid pace than its predecessor. It is a slow paced bore compared to the stealth espionage vibe from the first film. You initially get high tension scenes with great stakes where anything can happen, which turns into meaningless explosions with no suspense in this sequel.

For an action movie, there is little action until the ridiculously overdone finale that ruins any suspension of disbelief you might have had left. M:I 2 opens with a thrilling and genuinely impressive feat of strength from Tom Cruise wherein he is hanging off a cliff with his hands. It looks as cool as anything in an action film. It immediately establishes how strong and skilled Cruise's Ethan Hunt character is, but then the rest of the movie goes into explosions and back flips that remove you from the film experience. It is too bad they could not do better than the opening sequences that seriously thrill.

Next, the score from Hans Zimmer is not nearly as cool or iconic as Danny Elfman's entry from Mission: Impossible. Initially a mesmerizing soundtrack that keeps you engaged, devolves into Zimmer playing up a highly ill fitting score into each scene. Many of the musical cues do not match the tone of the scene. Tense scenes will suddenly launch into odd parades attempting epic stature, but feel so out of place. Likewise, tender moments will go from romantic to laughable in seconds thanks to the score. Elfman just did a nicer job composing Mission: Impossible when you juxtapose the music Zimmer composed for Mission: Impossible 2. Zimmer did not accompany this movie's atmosphere appropriately.

Finally, I must mention the acting. While the first film takes it time laying out intense scenes of excellent acting, M:I 2 reverts into cheesy one-liners and bland exposition. The poor basic writing is part of the problem, but this cast plays their parts with such dull enthusiasm. Tom Cruise is the only saving grace. He clearly is trying to convey emotion while jumping from serious and thoughtful to distraught emotionally. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is the glue that holds this franchise together. Thandie Newton is terrible as the love interest thief to Cruise's eccentric Hunt character. She is so deadpan that you never believe her emotional scenes. Her delivery is pretty horrible honestly. Ving Rhames is fun as always as the Gucci and Versace loving hacker partner to Hunt. The Australian comedy relief is rather forgettable and makes for a poor replacement to Jean Reno's hilarious character from Mission: Impossible. The villains are all poorly cast and never threatening. They essentially act like evil Ethan Hunt caricatures. What a waste of the excellent actors Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson.",1525996800,,3979,5.0288315629742035

Villain and home base were mediocre. Team was ... not awesome. No fit. No chemistry. No team. I like MI because it gives better than lip service to the concept of TEAM. None of that here.

But even more egregious, the extra info with the film refers to the Metallica song (I disappear) which CLEARLY is Hetfield's voice CLEARLY!!! As Rob Zombie.

(head shake with stink face)

No. No it wasn't. This whole film is kind of like a film project no one bothered to double check before sending out the door. They got back to biz in MI iii, but if oyu're on the fence about watching this one, go for a walk - in the snow or rain even - instead.

It was awkwardly - bad first date level awkward - bad. But not so spectacularly bad that it'll give you stories so you sit through it. No, this is the date you leave by getting up and walking out. Never look back.",1518998400,,1061,4.176470588235294
