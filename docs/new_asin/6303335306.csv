631064,3,6303335306,"Agree with the previous reviewer.  There are some great documentaries in this set, but if you have any other history channel documentaries...you probably already have these ones.",1285459200,26,178,5.592592592592593
631065,2,6303335306,"Buyer beware-- a remix and match of History documentaries available in other collections. You need to research this one on the net if you have previous civil war sets. These offerings are previous releases offered up yet again. Same goes for the other recent history releases, Secrets of the Civil War, and other 2009 releases on the subject. On the other hand, if you have no other History Civil War documentaries, all are included here.",1259884800,72,438,4.8533333333333335
631066,5,6303335306,"I am somewhat surprised at myself for taking up for this small, obscure documentary, but the other review was so unreasonably harsh and intentionally misleading I feel that I need to. The production values of this film are admittedly low, but exactly how much money was supposed to be thrown at it? It is exactly what it claims to be, no more, no less. It is, in the end, a quite thorough telling of the history and operations of the United States Military Railroad during the Civil War, and damned if that isn't what it said on the box. Despite what the other reviewer has implied, the vast majority of this film consists of period photographs, well chosen ones at that. I'll concede that the model trains can seem a bit cheesy, but they do provide us with details that black-and-white photography cannot. Also, at no point during the video are scenes from ""The General"" shown. The only live-action footage, save the model trains, is of Civil War reenactors doing their thing. I can understand not liking this video, but why lie about it? Why refer to yourself as ""Veritas"" when you do? Even had the reviewer not completely distorted what this film is, he (or she) still committed the sin that so many of us can't seem to avoid: we end up reviewing what something isn't instead of what it is. This little video is not flashy or lavishly produced, nor is it the final word on the use of railroads during the Civil War. What it is is a well-told and earnestly made film about an interesting and often neglected subject. If you are at all interested in that subject, I have little doubt that you will enjoy this short treatment of it. In short, a better film could probably be made about the subject, but where is it and how much (more) would it cost? I bought this many years ago for five to ten dollars and have not regretted it.",1120867200,7,1829,4.479041916167665

7844477,1,6303335306,"Have worked on many documentaries that are recreations of history. This series is the bench mark. Unfortunately I was NOT able to view it, because Amazon sent the package as only viewable in another sector/region. Even though my address clearly states that I live in Australia. Amazon was good enough to refund the monies. But am bitterly disappointed that I could not watch the series.",1412812800,,386,4.953846153846154

7844479,5,6303335306,Perfect way to celebrate 150 years of the conflict. I have learned so much from this DVD's. The old pictures are outstanding. I recommend this very highly.,1382918400,,155,4.777777777777778

I first ran across him while looking at photos taken at Berlin, now Brunswick, Maryland.  His work is great for the study of history in that part of the country.",1332201600,,254,4.270833333333333
7844483,5,6303335306,"Ok, I understand  some of the other reviewers' complaints that Civil War buffs might already own some of the material contained within this set but keep in mind that there are over 28 HOURS of content here!

In early June of 2011 I was able to purchase this entire set on Amazon for $29.99, or 70% off the list price of $99.95.  The History Channel Store was selling the same set at the list price.  With savings like this who can complain about a bit of duplication?  For anyone else with any interest in the Civil War, purchasing this mammoth collection for such a great price should be a no-brainer.",1306972800,8,602,4.4363636363636365
