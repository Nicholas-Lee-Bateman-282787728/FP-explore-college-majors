8621610,5,B00GAHKY12,"We try to watch anything we can find about ancient Egypt, and this series is very well done and comes at the subject matter from a few different angles than other similar series have. One section delves heavily into the DNA subject. Great find.",1403395200,,244,4.568181818181818
8621611,5,B00GAHKY12,"Acorn Media/Athena brings more good documentary programs our way and at their usual exorbitant price.  These are good shows, although they are a collection of 5 independent 45-50 minute programs that do not constitute a series persay (dating from 1994-2011).  My complaint is the price.  For $50 list price you get 2 DVDs with around 240 minutes of programming and a tiny pamphlet with facts.  Amazon currently doesn't offer much of a discount from the list price on these.

Again, the programming is excellent and I try to support the release of such material.  Acorn has always thrived on charging these premium prices because they have exclusive rights to some quality UK programming that people WILL pay for.  I'm not sure they'll pay as much for educational programs such as these.  Sad.",1389744000,4,792,4.946969696969697
8621612,5,B00GAHKY12,"A 4-documentary set, with Egyptian civilization as a common link. Of course, the Pharaohs are as much a part as the common people. Egypt has always been a mystery--a never-ending puzzle the world continues to research. This DVD set is rife with new technology findings, newly revealed history. Very educational as well as entertaining for the Egypt culture enthusiast. I found much of my formerly learn head knowledge to be out of date. Glad I watched.

SDH SUBTITLES for all episodes
1~~ SECRETS OF THE PHARAOHS: A QUEST FOR ANCIENT DNA
A high-tech contemporary look at a civilization's leaders the world has fascinated over for millennia. Young King Tut comes to the forefront once again. Will DNA offer new enlightenment or new questions? Excavations in a late commoner desert cemetery filled with mummy remains is a fascinating segment I've never previously observed.

2~~ OASIS OF THE GOLDEN MUMMIES
WOW, an entire mummy catacomb revealed through film and Egypt's leading archaeologist. What can be discerned from these people's remains in North Central Egypt desert, miles from the Nile? A Canadian genetics lab assists in this legacy search amid a site located by accident only 4 years ago. In a South Central oasis proof is found of the world's earliest leprosy cases.

3~~ SECRETS OF THE SANDS
A space scientist reverses direction and looks underground (under Egyptian sand) for new discoveries. How did the pyramid culture begin? Modern space photography aids in understanding buried history and landscapes. With amazing results! I was captivated in this episode.

4~~ THE SACRED ANIMALS OF THE PHARAOHS
Animals are also found in mummified remains. This is a look at ancient Egypt's ancestral animal relationships. Were the Pharaohs kind to animals? The culture left thousands of clues behind, showing animals' importance via many venues. Ironically, the most revealing remains are found in Tuna, Egypt.

5~~ REALM OF THE DEAD --a 50-min bonus episode
Egypt has a particular history of celebration and remembrance related to death. Mummy process explained. Other cultures looked to Egypt's after-death notions -sometimes adopting bits.

A great library shelf addition to a pair of other Egypt DVD sets I've enjoyed:
