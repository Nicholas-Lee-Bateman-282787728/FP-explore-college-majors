8135494,5,6305404577,"EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY, VERY TRUE TO LIFE ON HOW THINGS WORK IN THE HOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE, IF YOU THOUGHT THE ACTING WAS BAD ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ACTORS, IF YOU THINK THE CAMERA SHOTS ARE BAD LET ME JUST REMIND YOU ON HOW HARD IT IS FOR A REGULAR SQUARE INDIVIDUAL TO WALK THROUGH A VERY DANGEROUS PART OF L.A. TO GET A INTERVIEW WITH SOME REAL GANG BANGERS AND STILL BE ABLE LEAVE WITH YOUR LIFE, MONEY AND YOUR FILM EQUIPMENT!!! AGAIN THIS IS NOT A MOVIE! THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY! SO GO WATCH BOYZ IN THE HOOD IF YOUR LOOKING TO GET ENTERTAINED! ""DEAD HOMIES"" AND ""WAR STORIES"" by KODY ""MONSTER"" SCOTT ARE ALSO REALLY GOOD FILMS TO EDUCATE YOURSELF ON URBAN WEST COAST GANG LIFE STYLE AND ACTIVITIES. A GOOD BOOK FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES IS (KODY ""MONSTER"" SCOTT A AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN L.A. GANG MEMBER)",1420588800,,815,4.368421052631579

8135496,3,6305404577,"The gang tales are decent. I'm from Killa Kali, San Diego in fact and I got relatives from ckrenshaw mafia. Some of them fools, were acting a little too hard for the way they act daily in the hood. It does get a little touchy though when they call out Mack 10. It is not the way it should be, but they hoods really do not get along anyway, so there is gonna be beef. I really don't recommend this for the real bangers out there. This is a movie for the people who don't really know too much about gangs. The statistics are a little off top, but you know they always exaggerate when it come to bangin'. Most of the gangs are makin' up some stuff as they are going along, not sayin' it don't happen but just be a little bit more realistic wit it. It depicts SOME but not all of what L.A. and the surrounding area is like. Add it to your collection. Not the best, but better than alot of the other's. This one actually has real gangstas I've heard of, so I had to get it.",1012435200,,968,4.020725388601036
