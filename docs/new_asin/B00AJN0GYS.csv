8629817,2,B00AJN0GYS,"My husband and I are in the food and beverage business and were excited to see how Chef Le Bras comes up with his culinary creations - and this was in the video, but it was just boring they way it was presented.  Not much talking, doesn't explain what he's doing  as they're developing a new dish or doing a culinary demo, and they don't show start-to-finish so you just see bits and pieces of how the dish was put together and have to guess at parts of what's in it.  Mostly the younger Chef Le Bras staring off into space.  Very disappointed - reall snoozer, and painful to endure.  Some nice history about the family, but not much about the restaurants and kitchens, at least not as much as we'd like to see.",1371427200,,711,4.276119402985074
