8760170,4,B01F5HQX1W,"Bought solely for Annie and Matilda. Never heard of Madeline. And surprised to find both Annie and Matilda (the movies I wanted) to be full-screen editions, which shows up as having vertical black bars on the sides of the screen for HD TVs. While Madeline (an ok bonus movie to have) is widescreen, which shows up as the preferred format to fill the screen for HD TVs. I'm still happy I have these movies for such a cheap price but if I'd have known this was the type of format I was going to get, I would have bought them individually instead. I would still recommend if you don't mind this as it is a minor nitpick of mine.",1531180800,3,625,4.260504201680672
