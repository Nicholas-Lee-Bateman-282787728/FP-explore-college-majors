2245069,5,B0007UVXCW,"if you take out the scenes of the nuns running up and down the dark halls of the convent then this movie is probably only 25 minutes long ... In the short I guess 84 minutes of this film I saw more doors opening and closing that can probably last me a lifetime, but then, of course, its a movie in a convent ......SSSHHHHHHH

All the girls in this movie except for the token fat and ugly nun ... there were no old ones here thats for sure .... are HOT HOT HOT .... The men are all pretty well continental dork material except for the bishop that had screen time at the beginning for about 4 minutes ....

The camera work on the sex scenes is absolutely stupendous and if you can overcome the 'nun' thing its probably one of the best erotica films around ......",1173484800,10,760,4.163265306122449

2245071,1,B0007UVXCW,"Yes, this is typical Joe D'Amato. It is explicit, but the the scenes are relatively short. If your curious and can rent it then do so. I wish that I had now that I'm stuck with a movie I don't particularly like. I've seen quite a few of his films, and I have ""99 Women""( the explicit euro vers.), ""Emmanuel in America"" uncut just to name two. This movie is so bad that I've only seen a portion of it, and I have no intention of seeing the rest of it. I wish they would release ""Top Model"" as that was a good one.",1167955200,4,512,3.9326923076923075
2245072,4,B0007UVXCW,"- The info above for the film at Amazon states the film is 82-minutes and that it's from Media Blasters.  The version I bought with the same cover(nun, cross, naked girl) runs 94 minutes and is a 2-disc special edition from Exploitation Digital(reg. 1/ntsc).  However, I recently found out(from a reputable website) that my copy from Exp. Dig. is missing a 3-minute scene involving female masturbation.
- The second disc includes a 65-min. documentary/interview called ""Totally Uncut: The Erotic Films of Joe D'Amato""(it's english sub-titled and rather explicit).  Actually, on the back of the dvd it says-90 minutes, but i used my time/text option on the film and it says 65.  Extras inclued an explicit trailer reel of 10 of his films(original full-length trailers it looks like, but don't hold me to it), plus a nice photo gallery.
- I'm no dvd-phile expert, but for a late 70's film, the picture and sound quality is quite good.  It looks fairly sharp and crisp.  The sub-titles are easy to read, and it's presented in a nice widescreen transfer(1.85:1).  The fleshtones look really good.
- Speaking of which, the film itself is only average with a head-scratching or eye-rolling induced ending.  But the erotic scenes involving attractive, naked, nuns kissing and caressing each other more than make up for the films shortcomings.  Although i must admit i was taken off-guard by the rape scene that started out as a rape scene and ended up being rather x-rated.  The film is rather explicit(ranges from NC-17 to X at times but don't worry, it never reaches bad porno level) as the warning on the back of the dvd said, but just the sudden explicitness during THIS un-erotic scene was strange.

Despite the missing scene in question, and the discrepancy in the run-time of the documentary, I still say this 2-disc special edition is well worth the price I paid for it.  For well under 20 bucks, this is one of the best sexploitation dvd's you could possibly have in your collection.  Highly recommended for the sexually-charged erotic scenes, the documentary, the bonus trailers, and the low affordable price.",1131321600,134,2112,4.932203389830509
2245073,3,B0007UVXCW,"Capt. Freaky here to review this wild convent for you sick freaks out there....

Lets start with the best part of this film...the hot musical score.  Whoever devised this music to accompany relatively hot nude nuns masterbating themselves and each other...deserves some serious credit.  If the images on the screen don't get you and your horny woman off....perhaps the music will.

That being said...the film quality was dark, less than lucid and often too blurry to see exactly what was taking place.  The much anticipated rape scene in the woods was ok...but given it was filmed in the 1970's, could have been better.  There is just something exciting about seeing these supposedly holy women get all juiced up and coming all over each other.  I would imagine this film may be very stimulating for some girls who fantasized about becoming a nun....but who are now living normal lives, barefoot around the house and being pounded by their boyfriends or husbands nightly.

The blend of holy devotion and sexual depravity can only be accomplished by the Italian sex industry.  Its too bad this film didn't take it all to the next level and show more actual sex...this would have been a great XXX film at the time...again, the rape scene is hot but not worth 5 stars!

One star for tackling the subject matter...one star for the great musical background...and one star for showing a nun getting raped!",1130198400,22,1399,4.864978902953586
2245074,5,B0007UVXCW,"After viewing many exploitation films, this gem has got to be the cream of the crop! It 'feels' like you're watching a European flick that finally made it through the cracks of the U.S. censorship board without being heavily axed (though there's nothing on the packaging to indicate this movie is 'uncut'). Though I don't think this type of movie is intended to be taken to seriously, the incredible musical score helps to make it feel like you're watching a mainstream production, and only enhances it's production value overall. It is explicit and not for those easily offended. The second bonus disc is another plus.",1129161600,32,619,4.904761904761905
2245075,3,B0007UVXCW,"A well packaged two disc set. The first is the film itself,set in a nunnery and surrounds, featuring the heady relationships between various nuns, and the impact of a stranger's arrival. Well presented in the main, with good clarity and colour. Leisurely and well framed, if lacking in story detail and characteristation. Well, what did you expect? Not as explicit as it is represented, but reasonably frank sex scenes. The second disc is an interesting documentary about the film maker, including various excerpts from his films. Exploitation fans will enjoy this romp, which enters fairly violent realms, but sometimes (thankfully) is so badly acted and presented (make up)that it can't be taken too seriously. A guilty pleasure.",1121731200,9,731,5.256410256410256
2245076,4,B0007UVXCW,"This has to be the finest Joe D'amato movie I have seen. My anticipation for this film was rock bottom after a recent viewing of the utterly awful Tough to Kill. The only other D'amto movie I rate would be Death Smiles at Murder.

If nuns in heat is your kind of erotica, Images in a Convent is a must own.

Instead of what I expected to see, a rough and ugly picture with little erotic charge, instead the subject matter is handled with sensuality, and a degree of serious intent. Helped along by D'amto's cinematography and a hypnotic electronic score, which complements the visuals. Nuns desperate for sexual gratification, too much isolation, working themselves and each other into a climax.

Thankfuly the sex remains erotic rather than pornographic although there are some fairly strong scenes through-out, including a rape, but never do they become ugly.

The soundtrack really works magic on this movie, and the whole affair imbues a haunting spare quality upon the viewer.

If your looking for some nuns in heat, this is well worth the price of admission.

Dvd is a two disc set and for the price very good value.

Perhaps best not shown to any devout Catholics, or other religious zealots, then again.......they might get furtive and renounce their faith.",1120435200,107,1265,4.828703703703703

8052064,2,B0007UVXCW,"Yes, there are 2 dvds. Images in convent  not worth any comments, yes, some skin, some plot, all outdated nonsense. Second disk with interview not bad as it has English subtitles plus short trailers. Unfortunately  trailers don't give D'Amato complete range of his imagination or movies and some of the best are missing.

This film has plenty of nudity of course, the steamy sex scenes aren't too graphic until the end.  I had anticipated some grisly scenes of torture and gore from D'Amato, but the blood spillage is very minimal.  This sacriligous tale will make you raise your head in surprise, but its also possible you'll feel guilty for watching.  Some words of warning--you might need some self-flaggelation afterwards.",1201392000,6,667,5.08256880733945
8052070,5,B0007UVXCW,"Considering ive seen almost all of joe D'amato films. i consider myself a good judge of his movies and let me be the first to say he is a terrible director, Dozens of movies with cheesy plots, Bat acting, and amatuer hour film crews. Hes even said it himself that he thinks all of his movies are bad and that he only did it for the money. But this one blew me away. take in to account that every movie i watch of his, i have a expectancy of being dissappointed, From the begginning to the end. This movies does not dissappoint, i mean one thing alot of people don't realize is that back then you did what you could with what you had as far as making movies. The music is unbelievable and even the storyline wasn't to bad either. The cast was definately a leg up compared with past movies and well. With d'amato you expect sex (whether softcore or hardcore(it had both, but you don't really expect lust and passion, which in my eyes this movie had. D'Amatos movies aren't for children nor are they for the weak of stomach but for me there an interesting view from a man trapped in the world of disney and animation and drama,comedy repeats that have been done so many times it makes me sick. This is one is definately a Classic and by far d'amatos BEST MOVIE EVER! But buyers beware this movie and many others hes made do shock and sometime sicken.
