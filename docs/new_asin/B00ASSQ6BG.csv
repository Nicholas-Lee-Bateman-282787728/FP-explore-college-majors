8557406,4,B00ASSQ6BG,"Louie Giglio is a dynamic teacher and conveyor of Biblical truth. He takes on the enormous topic relationships and singleness in the six part series called Boy Meets Girl. I found Louie to be very engaging and winsome particularly to those in the audience who may not be ready to hear what he has to say.

He starts from the very beginning by placing presuppositions clearly in front of his audience. Seven minutes into the first video he has already said God is at the heart of it all. Then he immediately opens the Bible and starts with Genesis 1:24 and says look at the word created.
The first session titled In the Beginning sets up the series on solid biblical grounds. He uses Gen 1:24 and 2:18, 21.
In the first message, he uses three terms to show the basic design God put in place: created, intrinsic, and arranged.
God created man and woman. He is the originator of relationships. He laid down the blueprints.
Intrinsic is our worth before God. He created us and our worth is not related to external things. We are made in the image of God.
Thirdly, Adam arranged the garden for Eve. But he was incomplete without Eve. He needed a helper.

In the second message, he is says his goal is fall in love with Jesus. God has a plan for your future. But Jesus is the central character (in other words, he is the Lord of your life). The best relationships have the same core. Or make sure your boyfriend/girlfriend is in love with Jesus like you are.

The third message is called Still Dating Dad. Giglio uses a prop of a bureau of drawers to illustrate all the baggage we bring into a relationship. There are five drawers he illustrates:
1. Generational Sin
2. Abandonment
3. Enabling Parents
4. Performance Based Acceptance
5. Abuse

It is important to realize that Jesus Christ faced all of our drawers and offers unconditional love. God gives us new DNA with our new birth in Christ. He used four of the drawers to construct a Cross on stage.

The fourth and fifth talks were a two part series called Waiting Here for You. He was making the point that most people see singleness as a time where we are looking for a new partner. His premise is that we should be spending our singleness falling in love with Jesus. By using Psalm 37 he illustrated how we should pursue God and He will give us the desires of our hearts.
He makes three points about waiting in the second part of this talk.
1. Waiting is active not passive.
2. Waiting is camped out on the truth. So don't try to short sheet Gods plan of purity in the meantime.
3. Use the waiting to prepare the soil for the harvest.

The last talk is called The Marriage Myth and he mentions seven myths that trip people up about marriage.
8. All ya need is love. He delves into the gender roles in marriage as an illustration that we need more than love. We need a commitment to Gods plan
9. Single problems with go away NO. Your problems won't go away; they will get magnified.
10. My current relationships are separate from marriage. He said, To find Mr. Right get rid of Mr. Right Now!
11. If at first you don't succeed, try again. Cohabitation is not the best way to prepare for marriage.
12. Marriage is the be-all end-all of life. Matt. 22:23-30 teaches there is no marriage in heaven.
13. Marriage confines you. No, marriage completes us.
14. I don't think I can do this. Or I do think I can do this. Both of these are myths! The gospel makes marriage possible.

Throughout the series, Giglio is very straightforward with his audience about the purpose of singleness. The purpose is to seek and pursue God. By doing so one discovers whether God is directing one to a mate for life or if that is not true, God may be directing them to singleness.
I would recommend this series as a way a church could help their singles understand Gods heart and plan for them before they get into a relationship.",1464048000,,3858,4.425352112676056
