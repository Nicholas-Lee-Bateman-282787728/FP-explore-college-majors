8086319,5,B000BFYFKA,"Great final performance of Mr. Big with Ritchie Kotzen on guitar. Check the region code, because my copy only plays on an all-region DVD player. Luckily I own one.",1241136000,3,163,4.655172413793103
8086320,4,B000BFYFKA,"I bought this CD because I love everything Mr Big has done. However, although this is a great show, it lacks the FULL energy of their heydey (see DVD of Mr Big LIVE - shot in San Francisco with original guitarist Paul Gilbert). Ritchie Kotzen dazzles as always, and Billy Sheehan proves once again his prowess on bass. Pat Torpey does his thing on the drums and hits HARD, and Eric Martin is Eric Martin: one of the BEST rock vocalists alive.

Only concern I had was what I saw on this DVD was what I saw when they came to Palo Alto during this period: they seemed tired. As mentioned, Mr Big of the early 1990s TORE UP the stage and hit the crowd like a ton of bricks. This show, although sounding great as always, shows a band at the end of their tenure, ready to call it a day. Yes, this is the farewell show, but if one asks why I give this 4 out of 5 stars, this is why. All else about this DVD says ""Buy it!!!"" My opinion is buy this & Mr Big LIVE... it will give you a full perspective of Eric Martin & Co.",1182470400,,1013,3.9901477832512313
