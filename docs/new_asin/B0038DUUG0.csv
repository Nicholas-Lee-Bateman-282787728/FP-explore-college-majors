4084371,5,B0038DUUG0,I love this movie! I have already watched it several times. The music is great and the story is classic. I just love this movie!!,1314489600,,129,4.2
4084372,5,B0038DUUG0,Priyanka is one of the most adorable young ladies in movies today. the writing is great in this movie about life and pyaar. The music is so good that i listen to it on a daily basis and haven't gotten tired of it yet. i like the movies about the underdog and the twists and movement of the characters is awesome and the directer makes a small appearence.,1305763200,,354,4.220588235294118
4084373,5,B0038DUUG0,"I relate to this movie so much, it's kinda sad actually.  But Abhay Sharma (Uday Chopra) was the biggest pushover I've ever seen.  I was frustrated at times when Abhay was acting like a complete geekazoid and not growing a pair to confront the one he loves, or the one whole stole his million-dollar idea.  But excluding this, every part of this movie was perfect, and very enjoyable.  The ""Thai Tradition"" part was kinda wacky and I didn't like it as much as some might, but it was very entertaining.  Priyanka Chopra is a goddess as Alisha, and there is nothing else really I can say about her.  Her young daughter, played by Advika Yadav, was annoying at times, but was very good in her part and even becomes very like-able towards the end.

I love this movie because I can really relate to it, and it's your standard beauty and the geek movie.  Topped with Priyanka Chopra, you cannot go wrong.  Watch it already!",1303171200,,917,4.509090909090909
4084374,4,B0038DUUG0,"I won't go on too much about the plot as you can read it in the product description.

I missed this in the cinema; it didn't get rave reviews so I wasn't particularly worried. So I was pleasantly surprised when I bought this from Amazon.

The plot actually has more depth than I thought it would; ""geeky guy pining over item girl"" hardly inspires confidence. The plot thread of Abhay getting credit for the software he invented is engaging (and on a side note - his idea for an operating system that unifies other operating systems is actually pretty good). You will see where the romance is going from the get-go, but at least the `stolen program' plot thread is a little fresher.

Uday Chopra (as Abhay) finally gets a decent role, and he I think he makes a good - if unusual - lead. He wrote this film, too. Priyanka as Alisha is charming as usual, and Advika Yadav as Tania (Alisha's young daughter) is initially infuriating but becomes loveable.

The music is so-so. No real stand out tracks.

Everything else about the film is good quality. Well directed and edited.",1296086400,2,1072,4.5625
4084375,5,B0038DUUG0,"I first saw this movie on Netflix.  I was so impressed that I bought it on Blue Ray.

This is probably the best Romantic Musical Comedy that I have ever seen.

For the most part the film is in Hindi but there is a lot of english dialog in it.

All five music videos are fantastic.  Any of them would become a top 10 hit if it had exposure.  I find myself singing them in the car.

Blue Ray video and soundtrack quality is excellent.

What can I say?

This film is a sleeper.

I love this film.",1276387200,6,493,3.938775510204082
4084376,5,B0038DUUG0,The movie and music complemented each other very well.  I listen to the music almost every day.,1273708800,,95,4.588235294117647
4084377,3,B0038DUUG0,"How can I describe 'Pyaar Impossible'? Well, I guess I would have to say it's like a warm, flat soda. This movie had all the chance to sizzle, but it just fell flat, from the performances to the music in the film. The most interesting part of this film for me was the possible story line playing in my head; wondering since Uday went yo college in California and wrote this flim, did he maybe take from his real life story?
If you have nothing else to do and you are desperate for a hindi flim then it's worth a watch other than that, it's a pass.",1270684800,,547,4.121495327102804
4084378,1,B0038DUUG0,"I did not like this movie at all.  The male lead had odd facial features.  The female lead is very pretty but acting is not her strong point.  She did not do a bad job of acting, it just wasn't that great.  The two of them together had absolutely no chemistry.  He was supposed to be a nerd who had known her in college.  She did not pay any attention to him but he was ""in love"" with her.  Years later, he is a software designer and she is a divorced single mother.  They meet again because she works for a company that has another employee who had stolen his software design idea from him.  He wants to reconnect with her and get his software back.  When he goes to her house, she does not remember him and thinks he is the nanny she has just called to watch after her incredibly badly behaved little girl.  First of all, I hate movies in which spoiled, rude, obnoxious, kids are portrayed as cute and the parents smile and scold mildly.  It is so aggravating- probably because I teach and have to put up with that sort of behavior in the classroom.  Anyway, I could see the writing on the wall when I saw how irritating the kid was.  She would be bad for the fifteen other nannies she drove away but this nerdy guy who was not a nanny would turn her around.  The mom drags him in to act as the nanny and he acts like he has no chance to say that he's not the nanny.  How ridiculous- and of course he continues the charade just to be close to the mom who treats him with indifference most of the time.  This movie was a waste of time.",1270425600,,1536,4.083612040133779
4084379,4,B0038DUUG0,"I've always regarded Uday Chopra as a second hand leading man, but I may have to rethink things because of this movie, and maybe Uday's being so likable in this one is due partly to his having done the writing and producing along with the acting. But there's a lot of wish fulfillment in PYAAR IMPOSSIBLE! - if you ever were a nerd or if you've ever yearned for that special someone who never even glanced at you one time. Slackers like me, we dig movies like this. Even vanity projects like this.

Pity the poor unassuming nerd. Uday Chopra plays bespectacled college loser Abhay Sharma and he's deeply smitten with the beautiful Alisha (Priyanka Chopra, no relations, thank god). But the social status quo the way it is, Abhay never stood a chance. Didn't even matter that he saved her life one evening. She just never noticed him. And then she left college.

It's seven years later now, and Abhay still pines for Alisha, but he's moved on, sort of. A computer whiz, Abhay has over the past seven years been working on a revolutionary software and he's at last perfected it. But, in the midst of pitching his product to a prospective investor, his software is stolen. A distraught Abhay tracks the thief down to Singapore, where out of the blue, on the street, he sees... well, you can guess...

PYAAR IMPOSSIBLE! (""Love Impossible"") is a romantic comedy that shouldn't really work, but does. The story is contrived, the situations are formulaic, I saw every plot twist coming, and it didn't matter. I still liked this movie a lot. With not much being original nowadays, it all falls on execution and the appeal of the actors. And this film benefits from slick direction and a very likable cast. Priyanka Chopra, who was amazing in WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE?, has become a fine comedienne and she turns in another marvelous performance, seamlessly segueing from college party girl to responsible single working mother. The precocious and very adorable little girl, Advika Yadav, makes her debut and she is a born scene-stealer. And Uday Chopra comes across as so damn nice and sweet. His Abhay Sharma quietly dreams his big romantic dreams, way out of his league, and it's really hard to hate on him. It'd be like kicking a puppy. I wish, though, that Uday had pulled out more from his repertoire of expressions than just that one persistent goofily smiling, half-dazed look.

I liked the musical numbers - ""Alisha,"" ""10 on 10,"" ""Pyaar Impossible,"" ""Ek Thi Ladki (bada bada boom),"" and ""You & Me"" - pretty much all the tracks are breezy and hummable. There are some really good laughs in this one, the best being the utterly sidesplitting ""Thai tradition"" scene and those moments when Abhay demonstrates his questionable nanny/housekeeping skills. You've got Abhay assuming a double life and then a triple life, and he's got his work cut out for him as he tries to keep this and that identity secret from various people. There's the corporate theft sub-plot and a dash of caper intrigue as Abhay tries to get back what's his. Mostly, though, it's about the unrequited love story and the comedy. Fine with me. It's nice to find out that, once all is said and done, pyaar is not impossible after all...",1268870400,11,3196,4.732495511669659

4084383,1,B0038DUUG0,"This was so painful to watch I couldn't even get halfway through it.  The songs are inane and ridiculous and is the puppy dog drooling of the male lead. He's a pushover who can't think for himself, even when someone steals his invention that took him seven years to create.  And a spoiled brat as the female lead's daughter makes it even more difficult to stomach.  So annoying.",1470960000,,378,4.529411764705882

4084400,5,B0038DUUG0,"Well, for those of you who have not seen any Bollywood films, this may be a good place to start, along with DIL BOLE HADIPPA.  In my family, we LOVE Uday Chopra!  He has a self-deprecating humor that seems to be part acting and part self-revelation.  This is a great story and has music that will stick in your head for WEEKS at the least :)",1358208000,,341,4.136363636363637
4084401,5,B0038DUUG0,"I honestly loved this movie because of the strong chemistry between Uday Chopra and Priyanka Chopra, but also between him and the little girl he was babysitting for much of the film, hard to believe this was her first major role.  You find yourself rooting for the geek (played by Uday Chopra), that he wins the heart of Alisha (played by PC), and along the road a lot of funny moments.  My big favorite was the Thai tradition scene where Uday serves everyone Thai food (I keep replaying that on the DVD).  I have seen Uday in Mohabbatein and Neal N Nikki, (both of which I own) but he really shines in this film.  This is one of the newest additions to my collection because it's such a cute film, do give it a look!",1358035200,,717,4.288888888888889
4084402,5,B0038DUUG0,This was a surprisingly funny and interesting movie.  There is a lot of jet-setting and spy type action and its a wonderful family movie.  The story line is cute and the actors do a very good job in their roles.,1353888000,,211,4.25
4084403,5,B0038DUUG0,"This movie is so different from an other that Uday Chopra has done before. It's gotten a lot of negative reviews from the Indian community for being to ""American"", but I absolutely love it as does my young son. :)

The soundtrack is amazing and very well written, and the movie is a riot to watch. It's one that you will want to watch over and over and keep the soundtrack on repeat!",1352332800,,383,4.2465753424657535
4084404,5,B0038DUUG0,"Although Amazon says the Blu-Ray contains 1 disc, it actually contains 2: The movie on Blu-ray plus a bonus standard DVD with:
* Making of the Film
* Making of the Songs
* Deleted Scenes
* ""You and Me"" music video
* Fun Moments
* Video Blogs

Others reviewed the movie in much more detail, so I won't review it here. But here's why I bought it: I had to own this movie after watching it on Netflix. Even though I never saw a Bollywood film before, even though I had to Google search why 1/3 of the dialogue is in English -- in mid-sentence! (it's ""Hinglish""!) -- and even though it runs 2 hours and 20 minutes... PYAAR IMPOSSIBLE is my second-favorite romantic comedy behind SHALL WE DANCE with Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon. Maybe it's wish fulfillment for a geek. The movie is pure fun, and the ending is pre-determined by being a rom-com, but it leaves you guessing how Ahbay's going to get from Point A to Point Z.",1348272000,4,937,4.385057471264368
4084405,1,B0038DUUG0,"I was looking for a romantic Bollywood movie bout an underdog winning a girls heart. I was expecting a performance a notch below SRK. Boy was I wrong. This movie has more English lines than Indian, da songs are terrible, the dialogue even worse, and priyanka Chopra's acting is simply unbearable. Simply put if u are a fan of old school Hindi movies such as KKHH, DDLJ, KKKG, RNBDJ, etc, and are seeking similar romantic Indian entertainment than run in the opposite direction if this movie. I wasted 2hrs if my life with this garbage, save your 2hrs for anything else.",1346544000,,569,4.643564356435643
4084406,3,B0038DUUG0,"A fun, accessible, but ultimately forgettable Bollywood romantic comedy. It has all you expect (and perhaps love) about Bollywood--a simple plot, lots of colorful song and dance, and tame romantic scenes (their lips never touch). What I miss is the over-the-top glam that usually accompanies these tales. Because this one is set in the nerdy world of the software business, they are more limited by their colorless subject matter. Still, you can't go wrong here, and it makes for an enjoyable viewing, especially for westerners who may not be as familiar with Bollywood productions (much of the dialogue is in English).",1336089600,,619,5.138613861386139

4084408,5,B0038DUUG0,"This 2010 Bollywood treat is my favorite foreign film. ""Pyaar"" means ""love"" and love does seem impossible for a computer geek (Uday Chopra) who has eyes only for the popular girl ( the lovely Priyanka Chopra) who doesn't even know he exists. Years later, through fate and a case of mistaken identity, the geek becomes the male nanny for his secret crush's little girl. This movie offers a buffet of movie genres; romance, comedy and drama. It's also a musical with such fun, catchy tunes as ""Ten On Ten"" and ""Oopsy Doodle."" I highly recommend it.",1328313600,4,546,4.697916666666667
4084409,5,B0038DUUG0,"This movie is Hilarious. Anupam Ker is excellent (the Dad) and the only annoying character really is the little girl. It's a good story with catchy songs.

8391227,5,B0038DUUG0,"Uday Chopra is a great comedian. This is a great fit for him. The entire cast executes a fun comedy with some expected sequences and a few surprises along the way.

This is a better film than Chachi 420 but still a worthy successor to the Mrs. Doubtfire formula that will feel familiar to Western audiences.

This would make a great first Bollywood rom-com for the uninitiated. Great starting place to fall in love with Indian films and Uday Chopra.",1520812800,,449,4.6

8391232,2,B0038DUUG0,"I usually love Uday when he plays a lovable nerd, but this movie I had a few issues with. Mostly the story was highly unbelievable; for example, the characters seemed to have way too much wealth for the time line and circumstances of the plot. The dinner scene where Uday served as waiter stretched on way too long. Mostly, I didn't care for the songs -  and using the child and an entire class of children to enact the mother's private and personal drama was objectionable. Finally, the way the romantic subplot was resolved became cringe-worthy.
