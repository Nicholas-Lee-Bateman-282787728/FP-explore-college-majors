4326038,5,B004C9MBX4,"This DVD is something to come home to on a very stressful day.  Best viewed at night with all the lights out, glass of wine and sit back in a nice recliner chair.  AWE... now take it all in.. 3D graphics here are wonderful.. soothing and puts you right inside the SEA.  Also, there are some slight ""pop outs"" as if the sea creatures were floating in your livingroom.  Unbelieveable.. if you are a fan of the sea and like to unwind and relax.. this is the DVD for you.  I love it.. will be listed as one of my top 10 DVD's for ""relaxation""!!  Best viewed in 3D of course.. :)",1328745600,4,574,4.080357142857143
4326039,5,B004C9MBX4,I am increasingly amazed at the 3d  - as sharp as any imax theatre experience. I jumped a few times and then was surprised to see a large fish come from behind over my shoulder and swim by right in my living room--truly unexpected. It was like being a frogman without getting wet!,1328659200,10,280,4.283018867924528
4326040,4,B004C9MBX4,"The 3D in this movie is pretty amazing.  Due to technical glitch we watched this 2D the first time which was not very involving - your regular TV nature show.  But with problems fixed, we watched it again in 3D and WOW - dolphins and whales in our living room.  Really engaging and gave a feeling of being in the water with these creatures.

For me, the movie without any voice over, or just some *facts* about the creatures and their lives would have been great.  The actual voice over was like being hit over the head with a bucket of self-righteousness for an hour.  Almost none of the doom and gloom facts were backed up with any statistics or explanation of what was going wrong,  and much of it is no doubt out of date as this movie is several years old.  So really, just tell us about the dolphins and whales and their lives, and leave the preaching and moralizing out of it, this movie is not the place for it.",1324166400,24,918,4.265895953757226
4326041,4,B004C9MBX4,we purchased this  movie for our grand-daughter who  loves dolphins and she  really liked the 3d  effect . It was like she was swimming with them.,1318204800,,146,4.5
4326042,2,B004C9MBX4,"The 3D is so-so at best, the picture quality varys from very good to poor. But the real problem is being beaten over the head with ""The Message"". Every nature show now can't get produced it seems unless after showing you all the wonders under the sun they then get to preach about conservation and how the death nell is sounding for the planet. OK, I get it and I'll sit through it I have nothing against conservation, great idea. But this show is just depressing, the writing is awful, and most of the photography is boring.

 I'll sum it up... whales and dolphins are dull, and you are killing them...

4326043,5,B004C9MBX4,"This 3D Blu-ray DVD is a documentary, as you can probably tell by the title, and it is quite interesting to watch particularly in 3D. I know 3D TV is not for everyone; however, I personally happen to enjoy watching 3D TV very much and own over 24 3D Blu-ray DVDs. 3D adds a special quality to the subject at hand by presenting the topic almost as if you were there. This particular DVD I found to be very informative and educational. It's great for children and adults of all ages. I recommend you buy this DVD if you haven't yet.",1313712000,14,530,4.257425742574258

4326048,2,B004C9MBX4,"My husband & I were both very disappointed with this Blu Ray movie. The 3D was blurry on and off throughout the film. It was also very dark in several scenes and difficult to see the animals. Overall, it was just not a good video.",1420329600,3,230,4.133333333333334
4326049,3,B004C9MBX4,"The 3D is great, and I was amazed to realize that sperm whales have nostrils rather than blow holes.  Why didn't I know that?  However, the information provided is more superficial than I would have hoped, which is why a docked it a star I would have given it.",1413849600,2,260,4.285714285714286
4326050,2,B004C9MBX4,"I believe you can get this movie as part of a 3 each DVD set for around $20.  Maybe I should have gone that route, but frankly I'm tired of watching these wildlife movies that constantly yap about ""climate change, habitat destruction, going to be extinct, etc."".  I mean, sure, give us the message do-gooders and make the statement, but please quit harping on it all through the movie.  Not sure if it was the message and/or quality of the picture that gave me the raging headache - but I sure had one when I was finished with this.  They dedicate a small segment on a particular species of whale or dolphin throughout the DVD and oh, yes, they're all dying, it's all our fault, and it's all climate change.  Sigh - what a waste of an opportunity to learn and enjoy something.  Take my advice and look elsewhere - spend a few more dollars and buy Under the Sea.",1399939200,4,861,4.35

4326052,1,B004C9MBX4,"I held on to this DVD for quite sometime before playing it. It didn't work, froze up all the time. I couldn't return it because of the time I held on and didn't make sure it worked. I haven't been disappointed by other Jean-Jacques DVD's so giving it a one really dosen't seem fair. Eventually I'll buy another, then edit this review.",1375315200,,334,4.403225806451613
4326053,2,B004C9MBX4,"Most scenes were taken in what looks very cloudy water, 3D effects are not good all all.  I have under the sea ones, that are clear crisp and vivid and the 3D effects in them are awesome.  Very short clip on various whales and dophins.  Looks more black and white than color being the water is not clear that they were photographed in.",1369612800,,335,4.285714285714286

4326056,1,B004C9MBX4,"I am blown away by all of the comments that the 3d is amazing..that was not my experience at all. We have a 3d tv and glasses and were not impressed at all with it. I also was not impressed with the movie itself. Some of the whales and dolphins were explained in just a blip. I would totally pass on this, not worth the money. I will be selling it.",1355702400,2,348,3.915492957746479

Hopefully there will be other movies of this nature!! I used to watch his father every week & I really miss that show!! I understand you can't do that without damage but maybe every year you can make a movie or two!!! You already might be doing that & I just don't know yet, if so advertise!! I'm sure there are more people like me that would LOVE to see what you see!!! Thanks for making these kinds of movies & I will be buying them all!!",1354665600,3,600,4.093220338983051

4326062,5,B004C9MBX4,"This review is so bias. I love Whale. Its a magical feeling when I first saw them during whale watching trip with my family in Wollongong, Australia. So watching this documentary really move me in a way that I feel more compassion towards the mammals. They are endangered species and it really sad that human kind drove them to extinction. Very educational and very beautiful documentary. If you love Whales and dolphins, treat yourself to this bluray.",1347321600,,452,4.883116883116883

This movie gives good info on the different species of dolphins and whales, but in comparison to the Other movies I have watched, the 3d was just average at best. I probably would have enjoyed it just as well in 2d. When u compare it to the others the picture quality and 3d seems blah, but if u like learning about dolphins and whales it's worth watching.",1337299200,7,440,4.313253012048193
