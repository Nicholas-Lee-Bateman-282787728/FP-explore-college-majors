8394775,5,B003DE5CGW,"I fell in love with Volume 1 of The Actors:  Rare Films of Evelyn Brent because I have already seen her in some sound films of the thirties and early forties, and was curious about why she was the sensation of interest during the silent film era.  I was not disappointed.  In Underworld (1927), she played a character named Feathers, who dabbled in fine clothes, and possessed a nice slender figure, who holds her mobster boyfriend in high esteem.  In Arizona Express (1924), she plays a young woman whose boyfriend is framed for his uncle's murder, and she tries to clear his name.  Also, as an added bonus, she and Maurice Chevalier do a comic musical routine in a clip from 1930's Paramount on Parade.  I wish this volume had included, The Last Command from 1928, in which Brent played the romantic interest of co-star Emil Jannings in Czarist Russia (it won an Oscar for Best Picture).  It would have  been even better, but I'm content with what was on Volume 1.",1417305600,,966,4.575581395348837
8394776,4,B003DE5CGW,"Evelyn Brent sizzles as a gangster's girl in ""Underworld"" and a dancer in ""Arizona Express."" You will not see Evelyn skipping a Mary Pickford dance or tugging on heartstrings a la Lillian Gish.  She is simply one hot gal!  Content aside, ""Underworld"" is a bit underexposed but not enough to discourage watching. ""Arizona Express"" is the better print of the two.  Both films offer well-placed and varied musical accompaniment. (Uncredited though)The only problem with these films is that there is not enough Evelyn!  Now it's time to order Volume 2!",1369526400,,548,5.055555555555555
