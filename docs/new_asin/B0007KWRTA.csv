Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman was my favorite show.  I wish someone would bring it back  with ALL NEW EPISODES, and with the same cast members.  The show that  replaced that time slot, Early Edition, is also a favorite of mine.  I hear  it's also supposed to be canned.  Can someone tell me WHY DO ALL THE GREAT  SHOWS GET CANNED?  Sure, we like the reruns, but why can't we keep some  good shows on the television, instead of bringing all these stupid weird  shows to the screen?  With the exception of Third Rock From the Sun, all  the alien shows are dumb.  Will you please, please bring Dr. Quinn back as  new episodes?  And will you PLEASE not can Early Edition?",961545600,2,799,4.213333333333333
2761630,5,B0007KWRTA,It was an awesome movie!  A perfectly laid out movie....with surprises... I would love to own the whole series! ...Thanks!,961459200,,122,5.1
2761631,5,B0007KWRTA,"Having missed the first episode but getting hooked on DQMW very shortly after I have wanted to see this video for years.  Coming from England where they don't sell the video I had to wait till I came to America to study.  Having now seen it it was worth the wait.  The only problem was the  different actors.  That was quite strange.  Even a non Dr Quinn fan who was  watching with me enjoyed this video!  I would love to get a complete set of  all the shows, especially the first series and if anyone knows how please  email me at k4willia@ucsd.edu.  Also if anyone knows where I can get a copy  of the wedding please email me.",943056000,6,628,4.228813559322034
2761632,5,B0007KWRTA,"I consider myself a ""new"" Dr. Quinn fan even though the show only lives in re-runs. I have always enjoyed Jane Seymour in movies but did not become familiar with the show until it came to my attention through Joe  Lando's grandmother, whom I treated as a patient at the hospital I work  for. The cast is much different but does not matter because it is important  to begin with the story plot of the series. As other have stated in their  comments, it was a shame that the show was let go from CBS' line up. But we  can still see it on re-run and there are many episodes that I'd still would  love to see such as Dr. Quinn's and Sully's wedding episode and the birth  of their child. I am glad for Amazon.com to offer such great movies for  purchase.",937526400,7,750,4.195804195804196
2761633,5,B0007KWRTA,I agree with alot of your viewers in the respect that I want all 6 seasons of Dr. Quinn. I think it sucks that they cancelled it and I don't have much respect for CBS. They don't know what they have started!!! All Joe Lando  fans are behind me!!!,919900800,,246,4.020408163265306
2761634,5,B0007KWRTA,"An overall great family series....It deals with issues that as a family you may find hard to discuss.  But when you see it on the show, somehow the way is open for a family discussion on some very important topics of  communication.",917308800,,232,4.5

8175754,5,B0007KWRTA,I love this favorite movie. Dr Quinn all of her show I love them. I would suggest anyone to watch them,1359590400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8175755,5,B0007KWRTA,"All of the Dr. Quinn episodes will move you in some way. ""For Better Or Worse"" is one of the most moving. This is the feature length wedding episode that has Mike torn between her family's wedding plans and the townsfolk. On the more serious end, Custer is out to get Cloud Dancing, and Sully tries to protect his good friend. The wedding, a beautiful event, will at the very least, have you all choked up and brings back the return of a few favorite characters from other episodes; even Hank and Jake become unlikely heroes. The closing scene is just too beautiful for words.

 This episode may also be found in the Complete Season 3 DVD set of the Dr Quinn series. There are a total of 25 moving episodes in Season 3, and on the DVD edition, ""For Better or Worse"" has commentary from Jane Seymour and Joe Lando that may be listened to during the view. For those who can't get enough and know they will watch them over and over, the sets sold by seasons are a great investment.

 They don't make em like this anymore...a wonderful mix of adventure, history and romance, all told in a way that makes us fall in love with the whole town, and makes for excellent family entertainment.

8175756,4,B0007KWRTA,"I found this episode of Doctor Quinn one of the best of this season. We (those of us who watched this show in it's first run every Saturday night) finally got the words we have been waiting to hear from Sully and Michaela...""I Love You."" The premise is that Dr. Mike has to go back home to Boston because her mother is deathly ill. She and the Cooper children are gone for a month and Sully begins to miss them terribly. He goes to Boston to make sure all is well with Michaela's mom and with Michaela herself. Once there he sees that a new man has entered her life.  Dr. Burke shows Dr. Quinn respect that she does not get from other doctors because she is a woman. Sully can see that the Dr. is really interested personally in Dr. Mike, and it appears she might have feelings for him as well. The children help Sully show Michaela that he isn't against Boston by ""courting"" her to a fancy restaurant and to the Opera. Quite honestly, when I watched this epsisode the idea that Dr. Mike would even think about another man angered me, but in the end she wised up and realized that her feelings for Sully were much deeper than she wanted to admit.  And even though she thought of Boston as her home, Home really was Where the Heart Is, and that is with Sully in Colorado Springs.",1122076800,,1278,4.276859504132231

8175758,5,B0007KWRTA,I really love this show... I still watch all the reruns over and over again!  Was soooo shocked and disappointed when they cancelled this show.

I have tried to get these video's with no success...,1026950400,7,318,4.543859649122807
8175759,5,B0007KWRTA,"Jeremy kagan excellent director delivers the goods on this pilot for TV.
Superb casting all way around.
Producer Beth Williams brings a fresh 90s look at the West.
Superb production value, from, hair, makeup, wardrobe, production design by [Ira Diamond. Set decoration and locations, the best.
The entire cast is superb, watch for the Characters Horace & Hank.
The stunt work, top quality performances by all stunt people on this series for 6 years.
The stuntcoordinator Jeff Ramsey, with tons of help from the entire crew will take credit for that.
A must for children, but watch out for heavy Feminist messages if you are ""old fashioned"",
