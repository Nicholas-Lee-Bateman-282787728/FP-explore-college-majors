7294976,4,B00ZUL9LMW,"I love this show. About a family of law enforcement devotees - 4 police officers current and former, two of whom are also current and former police commissioners of NYC, as well as their other family members. The family tends to be somewhat conservative, however, they are very accepting of a number of alternative lifestyles which they encounter during their work life. The family has dinner together every Sunday night and even goes so far to say grace before the meal. Many of the plots are - as noted in a different police/law drama - are ripped from  the headlines. The problem with the episodes dealing with current events is that this show always wraps up the problem in a tidy neat package. An example is that in one episode, where a housing project is basically terrorized by gang activity, at the end of the show when the police raid the complex to arrest the gang members the other residents stand and applaud as the gang bangers are being walked out. In today's world, the police would probably be pelted with rocks, spat on or even fired on by the other residents. In another episode, a protestor who wants a permit for a protest rally where they plan to burn the American flag, the organizer ultimately decides not to burn the flag after one conversation with the police commissioner. In real life, I don't suspect that would have changed his mind or caused him to alter his actions. Even these examples I could accept but for the one character of Danny, who is the commissioner's oldest son and is a detective. This character is what gives police a bad name. His actions are routinely over the line when it comes to abuse or investigation techniques. His actions would get any other cop fired. Too many examples to list, however some are slapping around a witness because the witness has the audacity to call him dude instead of detective. This witness was not a suspect. He actually chased down a suspect in the very first episode of the series and bashes his head against a toilet. He and his partner arrive at the door of a suspect and without a warrant kick in the door to gain entrance without knocking while (wink wink) asking ""do you hear someone calling for help inside?"" and the partner replies (wink wink) ""yes, I do"". No knock warrants are issued, but they at least are warrants. And finally this character selects his own cases, even investigating cases where he is the suspect. One episode he hits a running pedestrian with his car and investigates the person chasing the pedestrian. Due to his involvement no department would ever allow him to be assigned the case. Another case, his wife is kidnapped and he leads the investigation. And still another, after his father the commissioner is shot, he is specifically told NOT to work the investigation yet he does anyway , never with any repercussions. Other characters are good, even the kids, although the teenage girl can be annoying as they frequently are in real life also. And the crusty old great-grandfather, the former commissioner is wishing for the world in which he lived when on the department.

In spite of my criticisms about the one character, this is one of the finest shows on television. I would happily give it five stars if not for the totally unrealistic portrayal of a police officer's conduct that would never be tolerated in the anti-police climate in which we current live.",1468713600,,3376,4.701013513513513
7294977,5,B00ZUL9LMW,"GREAT show and yes, this set contains ALL episodes on multiple discs for the first 5 seasons.  The price was amazing considering every episode is included.  As a LEO, I dislike many police shows and dramas.  I can't stand CSI Miami for how they misrepresent the abilities of law enforcement and crime labs.  While some of what happens to the Reagan family in Blue Bloods is exceptional, the portrayals are well done.  Yes, the writers stretch things some, but nobody wants to watch a cop show that shows countless hours of paperwork and the REAL job officers do.  Entertaining, well written, and at least somewhat factual.  This is one of the only police dramas I can watch with my wife and not have to make an off-handed comment every other scene.",1468368000,4,748,4.66412213740458
