Director Rick Morales is in familiar territory as the man who helmed ""LEGO DC Super Heroes: Justice League - Attack of the Legion of Doom!,"" ""Beware the Batman,"" ""and Green Lantern: The Animated Series.""

My son really enjoyed ""LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Cosmic Clash."" He took the time to give it his review. He stated, ""Brainiac, the collector of worlds, has found a planet that comes between DZ and EB. He has taken captive of that world. Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman have been shot into different times. Wonder Woman is the Queen of the Cave in the time of dinosaurs. Green Lantern is the ship's cleaner in the time of pirates. Thunder Lad, Saturn Girl, and Cosmic Boy fight Brainiac-Superman in the future.

""What I like about 'LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Cosmic Clash' is Brainiacs super ship because it has many guns on it. I don't like Supergirl because of her whining. 'Cosmic Clash' is a movie everyone should see,"" Nine-year-old Ephraim told me.

""LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Cosmic Clash"" is not rated and for a general audience. Of course there's the typical comic book violence. However, there's always a lighthearted tone to everything.

There's not much when it comes to bonus material for ""LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Cosmic Clash."" A gag reel entitled ""The Justice League: Caught on Camera"" is included as a special feature. All our cherished super heroes ""candidly"" cause hilarity for everyone to enjoy.

Any aged fan of super heroes will find something entertaining and funny when watching ""LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Cosmic Clash."" With a good balance of female and male role models to latch onto, it's the perfect film for a quiet night at the house with the whole family. DC and LEGO have once again proved their partnership together is a genuine success.",1459209600,,2794,4.931914893617021
