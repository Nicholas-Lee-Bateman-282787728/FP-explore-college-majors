8383830,4,B002XUBDPQ,A very decent hypothysis of the range of theories and possibilities of Apocalyptic conclusions. Concise explanations. A must for the Prepper community.,1392595200,,151,5.909090909090909
8383831,4,B002XUBDPQ,"Leaves nothing unturned.  I guess the point is, we can be wiped out by many things.  After watching this you will realize that you should live your live day by day and enjoy it.  You never know when the Apocalypse will happen or which event it will be caused by.",1391644800,,262,4.2
8383832,3,B002XUBDPQ,"I hoped for dramatic graphic enactments of what might happen. Not the case. Also, the narrative attempts to strike fear or drama by suggesting that these event are likely, but they make terrible assumptions.",1366243200,,207,5.117647058823529
8383833,4,B002XUBDPQ,It was definitely no big budget film but the information and what-ifs in the movie make you think about how fragile we really are.,1363219200,,130,4.458333333333333
8383834,3,B002XUBDPQ,"I'm a devoted disaster movie buff and will watch most anything devoted to world-wide destruction. While most of the movies in that genre are rather poor there are sometimes those that manage to work in a reasonable human interest story to supplement the destruction; this is not one of those, it is a sort of documentary of rather well known ""end of the world as we know it"" theories.

I did find it interesting enough to watch it all the way through but will probably not watch it again. There were really no new thoughts presented which made it much more of a review than a revelation. I suggest this one be viewed on streaming video before buying; perhaps you will enjoy it enough to buy the DVD.",1351296000,3,699,4.4609375
8383835,2,B002XUBDPQ,"This really did not need to be much longer than 45 min.  The CERN segment has now been proven ""wrong"" as the Haydron collider has been running and we are still here, at least I think.  The climate science is also out of date. Wish they would have talked more about the climate change due to the change in the Earth's orbit.

But still, this gives you ammunition for when you are bored out of your mind during meetings at work.  The alien and robot attacks need some equally out-of-this-world solutions.  Let your mind run wild and the meeting will be over before you know it.",1341273600,4,575,4.386792452830188
8383836,2,B002XUBDPQ,The documentary was very turgidly portrayed.  Could have been completely told in about 30 minutes.  The black hole segment sounded a bit farfetched.,1339545600,5,148,5.391304347826087
8383837,5,B002XUBDPQ,This is better done than a lot of movies I have seen . I love the special effects. Definitely recommended.,1338854400,,106,4.35
