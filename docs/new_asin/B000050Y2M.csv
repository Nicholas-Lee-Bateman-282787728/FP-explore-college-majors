7929422,5,B000050Y2M,Terrific documentary. All Italo-Americans should see this.,1482105600,2,58,7.428571428571429
7929423,4,B000050Y2M,"Finally, an account of the fate of Italian-Americans and relocation camps. A black mark against American policy. All should watch this and learn from history. We are still making the same mistakes.",1460246400,4,197,5.1875
7929424,5,B000050Y2M,"I teach a college level course on law, and have used this video in teaching the suspension of Habeas Corpus as it applies to the incarceration of 110,000 Japanese Americans. HOWEVER, WHAT MOST AMERICANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR REALIZE IS THAT ITALIANS AND SOME ITALIAN AMERICANS WERE ALSO INCARCERATED! When I raise this issue with Italian Americans they are in disbelief. Yet it happened and the fact that Japanese Americans were rounded up and denied their property and freedom is easily attributed to the issue of racism. Yet the fact that Italian Americans; White Americans if you will, the fact that they were incarcerated without trial or their protections under the Constitution is a dark period in our history. AND IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT RUN ON A CULT-LIKE WORSHIP OF OUR PRESIDENT. The negative experiences of our history should serve not just as a lesson of the past, but a more dangerous ""Warning"" of what could happen again. The video just states the facts and they are facts everyone should hear. This video and injustice should be known by All Americans, but unfortunately it is not. Ask your Italian American friends or relatives, and I doubt that they realize this injustice even happened.",1351814400,,1237,4.923444976076555
7929425,4,B000050Y2M,"This is the true story of America's internment of some of its own citizens during World War II.  It is well known how the Japanese Americans were treated, with their forcible removal from their homes and businesses after Pearl Harbor. But the same thing happened to Italian Americans at the same time.  It wasn't practical to do it on the east coast and Chicago, but it did happen in California.  They joined Italian citizens who were taken from merchant ships in U.S. ports and removed to Montana.  It was only after Italy surrendered that those men could go home, and the Italian Americans were free.  People need to know this, and that's why I recommend it.",1264896000,4,660,4.655172413793103
