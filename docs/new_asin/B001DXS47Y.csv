8295373,3,B001DXS47Y,Too many quick scene cuts for my tastes.  Very informative; although parts of it have the feel of a music video aimed at gen-exers or millenials.  Reminds me of how the documentary work of Winnona Ryder's character in Realty Bites gets chewed up by Ben Stiller's character when he uses it in his new venture:  In Your Face News.,1411862400,,328,4.52542372881356
8295374,4,B001DXS47Y,"This reenacted presentation of events surrounding the Salem Witch Trials and Executions was far more, and better, than I expected. Following the records kept by members of the Plimouth Colony (spelling intentional) and having actors/actresses act out those events brought home the sheer terror the dwellers of Salem experienced, along with the unimaginable torment experienced by those accused of witchcraft, etc., by various usually younger members of the society. One observation may have been far more representative of reality, that being the accusers allegedly rolling, screaming, babbling may well have been based upon their desires to have attention cast upon them. This would be fine, but there were a number of people whose lives were taken because of the 'testimonies'. This is an intriguing reenactment which could be well used to understand the paranoia of the Salem group. History buffs should be able to see new perspectives through this medium.",1353369600,3,959,5.4
8295375,5,B001DXS47Y,The video was a great help to introduce the time period and happenings around the witch trials in Salem Mass in the 1600's. It really helped my students understand better the play The Crucible.,1350518400,5,193,4.705882352941177
8295376,5,B001DXS47Y,"The witch hunts of 1692  have and sadly may always plague Salem, Massachusetts.  While other documentaries have been made on this topic ( equally as interesting ), this has to be the most definitive i've seen yet.  Author Mary Beth Norton is one of the sources used in this feature. If you haven't read it, I recommend her book: "" In the Devil's Snare"". Much of the documentary comes from her research.  A few years back, a theory surfaced that the girls "" ailment "" was caused by ergot poisoning. This film does address that idea as well as other possibilities.  I'd recommend this for high school level and beyond. This might be too intense for middle school. ( the execution of the accused is a bit graphic, not so much visually but audio wise. ( they sound like they are struggling, accurately showing that they died from strangulation).

Other than that, its well done and very informative.  ALong side this, i'd recommend "" Rediscovering America: The Salem Witch Trials"" hosted by David Hartman. Its not as in depth, but a good primer to  "" Witch Hunt""",1326844800,11,1058,4.620320855614973
8295377,5,B001DXS47Y,"Witch Hunt is a very engaging DVD about the Salem Witch Trials. Both high school American Literature teachers who teach The Crucible and U.S. History teachers who teach about colonial life will find this DVD helpful in teaching about what happened in Salem from 1692-1693. The reenactments were very well done and the experts interviewed were interesting as well. It can be difficult to get and keep high school students' attention, but this DVD did so without a problem. I've read reviews on other websites where people complained that there was too much focus on ergot, a fungus in the LSD family, being baked in the bread as having been the cause of the girls' strange behavior. I didn't think it focused too much on this theory at all; several theories were presented. I was glad to have this DVD to present background information to my students before reading The Crucible. I think it makes reading literature much more meaningful if you can get some background information about what you're reading ahead of time. I don't think my students will forget this DVD anytime soon. We all enjoyed watching it, even though I made them take notes.",1290211200,15,1144,4.812182741116751
8295378,5,B001DXS47Y,Easily the very best program on the subject yet produced.  Great details and terrific photography.  Don't be hoodwinked by high prices for used or secondary market sellers.  This dvd title is available directly from the History Channel for $29.99.,1210291200,,247,5.282051282051282
