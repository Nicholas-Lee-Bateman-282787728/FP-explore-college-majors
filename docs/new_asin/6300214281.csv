7805649,5,6300214281,"I noticed one reviewer point out it is a true story.  All I know is that this movie features one of my favorite actors (Tom Skerritt) as a man who has been touched by violence and won't stand still for it.  On one hand, it is motivational for one to take a stand.  On the other hand, it shows the cost and the bitterness caused by fighting evil.

This is very violent; I would not take the kids to this one.",1169164800,5,407,3.9876543209876543
7805650,5,6300214281,"This is a fictionalized story of Newark, New Jersey's Anthony Imperiale who, despite being called by some a vigilante, was a great humanitarian who helped anyone in need regardless of their color or background. He served as a Newark City Councilman, and as both a New Jersey State Assemblyman and Senator. Originally this movie was supposed to be a true version of his story, but some how the deal fell through. There is one part in the movie where some footage of him is used. He passed away 12/26/99.",1076371200,7,502,4.651685393258427
7805651,4,6300214281,"Taking place in a crime-ridden Philadelphia neighborhood, Fighting Back is the story of a blue-collar Italian-American businessman played by Tom Skerritt who, after seeing his own family victimized, begins a neighborhood watch association that soon transforms into a squad of well-meaning but violent vigilantes.  As Skerritt is both recruited by local politicians and targeted by the street gang that controls his neighborhood, the organization slowly grows out of control until it becomes as much a threat to freedom as the criminals it pursues.  Unfairly dismissed as a Death Wish rip-off when originally released, Fighting Back is actually a far more intelligent film than most urban vigilante films and actually makes a fairly succesful attempt to realistically examine the consequences of such actions.  The violence is surprisingly brutal and the film manages to find room for actual character development so that, for once, the action doesn't take place in a vacuum devoid of emotion.  Lewis Teague, along with Joe Dante, is one of the best (and most intelligent) directors working in the field of ""genre"" filmmaking and he directs with a nicely natrualistic feel.  The acting, on the whole, is good with only the film's main street gang coming across as stick figures.  Michael Sarrazin turns in a good performance as Skerritt's best friend who becomes the first to suspect that their cure to crime might be worse than the actual disease while a pre-Sledgehammer David Rasche has a lot of fun in a small role as a reporter.  The film's main strength is with Tom Skerritt who, surprisingly for those who remember him mostly from Picket Fences, is totally convincing as a serious-minded, blue collar Italian from Philadelphia.  He brings a nice bit of ambiguity to the role and never tries to make his character a saint or a super hero.  He gives the film a much needed dose of humanity that is missing from films like Death Wish and its clones.  All-in-all, Fighting Back is an unjustly underrated film that deserves more attention than it's been given.",1013299200,10,2061,5.071005917159764
