2620173,3,B000GW8RYS,I have seen some of his other shows and found that this DVD was kind of controlled.. I felt that he was too conscious of the fact that he was making a DVD with this show. I must still admit that it was still  really hilarious.,1168300800,3,226,3.9130434782608696
2620174,4,B000GW8RYS,This guy was pretty good.  Being around Asians since I started working just makes me appreciate the humor even more.,1167955200,,116,4.8
2620175,5,B000GW8RYS,Russel Peters is going places. If you like politically incorrect standup then this is a must see.,1167955200,,97,4.764705882352941
2620176,4,B000GW8RYS,"I saw the edited version of this show on Comedy Central and laughed my butt off! So I thought I would get the DVD for my parents.  Not a good idea.  Parts of it are really raunchy which is a shame because you have to be conscious of who is watching it.  Definitely not suitable for someone under 18.  When Russell Peters is not being raunchy, he is really really funny.",1163116800,11,369,4.154929577464789
2620177,5,B000GW8RYS,"russell peters is undoubtedly one of the best new-age stand up comedians.his fans have also made him the most downloaded comedian on the net.his brand of humour is universal and appeals 'cause he is not afraid to talk about things people want to talk about,but are scared of offending someone in this increasingly irritating politically correct society.

  the dvd has excellent material and talks about some new ethnic types as well as the old ones(indian and chinese)worth a buy and definately worth keeping in your collection.",1159315200,4,529,5.127906976744186
2620178,5,B000GW8RYS,"My colleagues and I went to see this show live. If you have seen the 45 mins video online that has been circulating for a while, you are going to love this one as well.

This is new material, and very funny. He talks about many ethnic groups, makes fun of them, and knows how to make fun of himself. His accents are impeccable and if you have been exposed to any Asian cultures - you are up for an awesome treat.

I have sent it to already 5 friends (oh yeah, buy the DVD..Support him)",1158364800,24,485,4.041666666666667
2620179,5,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters is a global phenom. I heard of him 10 years ago and have been following his career ever since. His take on culture and the world is incredibly funny and his knack for doing accents is untouchable. If you want to enlighten your mind about the world while busting a gut..this is the guy. you will play this over and over and i suggest you don't share it, because you will never get it back. If you're Indian or Chinese, finally there is someone talking to us and making us laugh.",1156723200,7,492,4.301075268817204
2620180,5,B000GW8RYS,"I know the DVD is not out yet...but do we really need to wait till the DVD is out to know that it's going to be phenominal?  Based on all his work before and seeing him on stage live, I know the DVD is going to be awesome.  I just pre-ordered the DVD and can't wait to see it.  He is one of the best comedians out there.  I can guarantee that you will laugh your [...] off with his jokes.",1154995200,2,388,3.753086419753086

2620191,5,B000GW8RYS,Russell Peters is really funny. He does a lot of different accents and he touches on a lot of different races and stereotypes.,1393286400,,126,4.521739130434782

2620193,3,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters first standup DVD is funny, but sense then his standup DVD's have been lacking in comedy, this DVD is not very funny.
I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. Watch Russell Peters first DVD you will laugh your but off, but all of his other DVD's are not as funny as his first one.",1388102400,,296,4.2105263157894735

2620196,4,B000GW8RYS,Love this comedian. Let's see more DVDS. His material is original and so multicultural. worth the time and money. A new find for sure.,1383264000,,134,4.625

2620199,5,B000GW8RYS,"Most comics just blurt out expletives and expect you to laugh along without knowing why.  Peters will tap into a common vein without pandering to the lowest common denominator.  His humor is sharply insightful, intelligent and original.  the world is getting smaller, and we can only meet more people and realize we do need to laugh at each other more.  You feel smarter after watching this video.  And you'll laugh a lot.",1364947200,,422,4.805555555555555
2620200,5,B000GW8RYS,This was the first Russell Peters standup i've ever seen thanks to my brother's pirating days.  I've lost the file since and needed to have this in my collection.  Funny material.  Well executed.  Buy this or somebody's going to get hu't real bad.,1356912000,,247,4.674418604651163
2620201,5,B000GW8RYS,Great dvd and funny as heck! Greatly packaged and sealed from seller. Now I have to order two more dvds from Russell Peters! Funny man must buy if you haven't already!,1345680000,,167,4.419354838709677
2620202,3,B000GW8RYS,"I'm not sure how I feel about this one, but for me it rates around 2.75 stars. It definitely had its LOL moments, but there was also rehashed material that you can watch for free on You Tube. He also seems to be getting very self-important which is a major turn-off in and of itself. He treats the audience like they are all morons and interacts with them like a pontificating professor from the University of Know-It-All. On a positive note, he doesn't speak of himself in the third person... yet.",1343347200,,498,4.483516483516484
2620203,5,B000GW8RYS,HALARIOUS!!!!  If you want to be entertained laught so hard that you cry buy this DVD.  Russell Peters is spontaneous and interacts with the audience in a way that is so creative that you can't wait to hear what comes out of mouth next.,1337299200,,236,4.340909090909091
2620204,1,B000GW8RYS,First of all let me say that Russel Peters is a funny comedian but this special was horrible only one joke he said at the beginning that he said about asians and civics and that one I chuckled at. He spent to much time talking about asians and Indians Towards the middle of the stand up and a lot of his jokes were just bland. If your the type that laughs at every little thing then maybe this is for you. I learned a lesson from buying this and next time I'll make surepreview this on the internet before buying it. Get Russell Peters green card tour or comedy now starring Russell Peters if you really want a good laugh please take it from someone whose seen good comedy DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD IT IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT,1328745600,,738,4.1678321678321675
2620205,2,B000GW8RYS,It was good except for the foul langage through out the dvd.  We had heard him several  years ago and didn't realize that the swearing was so much.,1314403200,,147,4.214285714285714
2620206,5,B000GW8RYS,Already own this DVD.  Bought it as a gift for the holidays for my son-in-law.  He had it on loan for way too long.,1293235200,,115,3.75
2620207,5,B000GW8RYS,"Recorded this on the DVR, watched it last night, laughed hysterically, ordering this morning for myself and another as a gift.  Can't imagine ANYONE not finding this wet-your-pants funny.",1292716800,,187,5.448275862068965
2620208,5,B000GW8RYS,It was shipped within 24-48 hours.  The item came new.  I cannot complain. I will buy again from this seller.,1282176000,,109,4.4
2620209,2,B000GW8RYS,"The guy was a total dissapointment. He went on a rampage making bad jokes about all minority races (balcks, brown, asians, etc) but then went on telling protective and polite jokes about white people.
Definitely he was targeting the white audience for his DVD release.
His brand sketch ""somebody's gonna get hurt"" was very lame and short,only about 30 second at the very end
Considering that this is a great comedian, and that he's done very well, this DVD was by far a waste of money, not",1279756800,,489,4.632183908045977

2620211,1,B000GW8RYS,"i am EXTREMELY disappointed.... i never rcvd my product and when i wrote to inquire as to why after over a month, i NEVER rcvd a response back. would not recommend this to anyone!!! >:(",1245974400,,185,4.314285714285714
2620212,3,B000GW8RYS,"I bought this for my girlfriend,she said he was hilarious but when the dvd was over she was disappointed. I had no expectations but I liked seeing a comedian address asian culture in his routine. Russell's parents are from India though he was born in North America, Canada I believe specifically.
There's  not enough lung busting moments as I think there should be in  a comedy act still he's got a few good jokes in there.",1231459200,,423,4.552631578947368
2620213,1,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters is hilariously funny, but this DVD is a waste of time and money! Its just not funny.",1230768000,,99,4.2631578947368425

2620215,5,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters is hysterically honest! He definitely tells it like it is. If you are offended easily, this might not be your cup of tea as he definitely divulges into different cultures & peoples. My husband & I laughed so hard, we were both almost crying.",1220227200,,256,4.586956521739131
2620216,4,B000GW8RYS,"This one is not as good as his other DVD which is super. It gets quite boring at about the last 15 minutes. But, over all, it's fun to watch.",1207440000,,141,3.7333333333333334
2620240,5,B000GW8RYS,I got the product exactly in the time that it was suppose to arrive and have enjoyed it ever since. Great seller,1206403200,,112,4.136363636363637
2620241,4,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters is a funny Canadian that has an Indian heritage.  Most of the humor is racially based (or maybe regionally based would be a better description), but funny.  Certainly less offensive than most racially humorous comedians...I would actually argue that he's not offensive at all.

Plus, his impersonations of the numerous types of Asians speaking English (which he claims is the way to distinguish between types of Asians) is hilarious.",1202256000,,448,5.28169014084507
2620242,4,B000GW8RYS,"I purchased this DVD b/c the concert for Russell Peters was sold out in San Jose.  So, I watched the DVD instead, thoroughly enjoying all his jokes.  He engages the audience and tells great stories.  I was laughing the entire time.  Not much else to the DVD except the show and his commentary on the show.",1200787200,,305,4.392857142857143
2620243,5,B000GW8RYS,"Like most of his audience, I saw Russel Peters on You Tube. And yes, I was motivated enough to buy the DVD. Expect laughter. Lots of it. Makes a great, unexpected gift. To yourself, or someone you really, really like.",1199664000,,217,4.45
2620244,5,B000GW8RYS,"I heard of his shows from all of them ""filthy downloaders"" (guess Russell is still working on making this ""un-uploadable"") who want everything for free. I have been a huge fan of stand-up comedy, though it is not a very popular form of entertainment in India.

This DVD was rib-tickling. I mean this guy totally totally rocks. He is very natural. His best ability? The way he instantly connects with the audience, involves them...makes them a part of the show. And all this, at times I felt, spontaneously (without a pre-written script). His material (recommended for 16 and above only) has something for every culture and this makes him rise beyond his Indian origins and be a part of every culture in the world. His sharp observation and its expression is words is something I am yet to come across in any other stand-up comedian. The guy can mesmerize you with his energy.

Audience, from all walks and cultures, connect to him and look at him as if he is one of their own. His humor is very subtle and well-aimed.

I am looking forward towards more new stuff from him.",1198800000,,1072,4.602094240837697
2620245,2,B000GW8RYS,"Okay jokes. I would recommmend watching the you tube videos of RP. His performances there are off the hook. Outsourced is more for the world audience. RP strength is his jokes about Indians, and a few other groups. Watched it once but was not captivated. However I still watch the you tube videos. I felt happy to support RP, but he's doing fine. Would skip this video until a more indian centric movie is released.  Overall RP makes me laugh but this video is not comparable to the you tube clips.",1198108800,,498,4.472527472527473
2620246,5,B000GW8RYS,"Not much to say here but this is classic Russell Peters material. Of course, if you've seen alot of his stuff online or bootlegged, then you've probably seen most of this show but don't let that put you off actually purchasing this DVD, it will keep you laughing no matter how many times you watch it!",1194134400,,301,4.392857142857143
2620247,5,B000GW8RYS,"Russel Peters is definitely the bomb.  Not only are his lines original but his mimicry of different races is icing on the cake for his routines.  The highlights are picking on Asian(Oriental + Indians) and Latinos.  One of the shows he did in London(I think) involved a routine about Srilankans and their long names and I was hoping there would be some of that here.  A couple of the lines were from earlier shows but they were slipped in at the right time so it was enjoyed.  And heck, they were his in the first place anyway.  Definitely worth checking out for Adults and older teenagers.",1190073600,,590,4.518867924528302
2620248,2,B000GW8RYS,"Russell Peters is a one trick pony.  All his material revolves around race.  This would be fine if he had something profound or enlightening to say on the subject, but he rarely does.  He takes the easy way out.  If 75 minutes of nothing but stereotyping, mimicry, and outright racist put downs delivered by a smug, unappealing jerk is what you are seeking, then you will not be disappointed.

RP definitely needs to broaden his repertoire or his act is gonna get old real fast.",1181001600,6,478,4.576470588235294
2620249,3,B000GW8RYS,It's a good dvd but I enjoyed a lot more all his performances that you can find on you tube.,1180051200,4,92,3.65
2620250,5,B000GW8RYS,"Guys just like the rest of u i was first exposed to Russell (Indian tone!) over the internet. This guy will tear up the every type of racial slur, comment, notes, social observations...u name it! this guy is just purely nuts.  If can so relate to this guys since my own little ethnic background has become a composite (Indian, PanArab, American, Egyptian!) It doesn't matter...i just laugh so hard the neighbor's knock!  if i was anywhere else and had the talent to pick on these various cultural elements with a fine colm like RP, i would quit my day job and work as a Global comedian! Get this u will laugh it up! If u don't get this disc then ""SOMEBODY GOING TO GET THE HURT REAL BAD!"" GO RP!",1177027200,9,695,4.338461538461538
2620251,1,B000GW8RYS,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.

I didn't get the other more popular choice because of a message posted on the reviews that encouraged amazon buyers to get this DVD; saying it was not endorsed by the Artist.

Well I have some advice for Mr. Peters. If you want people to buy your product then it may be a good idea to make something that is worth buying.

I watched it once and then traded it in for another dvd the next day.

Im sorry but this is NOT a funny dvd...",1173312000,2,473,4.053763440860215
2620252,5,B000GW8RYS,This guy is really funny and I don't think that many people know about him.  I'm hopping he'll do some more stuff soon.,1173312000,,119,4.173913043478261
2620253,3,B000GW8RYS,"For starters, I would definitely be more inclined to give Outsourced approximately three and a half to near four stars, but don't think it's really reflective and worthy of a full four star effort.  I was initially introduced to Russell through various recorded performances I could scrounge up on the Internet.  To me, Outsourced, serves as a good example of the comedian's stand-up routine...the birth of certain ideas and comedic inventions which unfortunately were never fully realized (I think largely due to a flat audience).

To put it simply, definitely not his best performance...  Nonetheless, I am taking a few friends to his performance on February the 18th in Hermosa Beach... confident it's going to be a great show and greatly looking forward to it!  Hope to see more releases by Russell in the future.",1171584000,3,817,5.022222222222222
2620254,3,B000GW8RYS,"Like many other fans of Russell Peters, I got to know his comedy from his 40 minute video download of the Internet.  Watching it over and over again, I was amazed by his accents, facial expressions, situational comedy and improvised skits.  So I bought this DVD hoping for more.  And more you get, as in more of the same.  The DVD's main feature is an 1 hour 20 minute video of him onstage somewhere in San Francisco.  He is performing to a multi-racial crowd, and as usual, his entire show is devoted to multi-racial comedy.  Many of his jokes are of the same nature as his infamous download, and about 20 - 25 minutes of the show is actually him performing the same comedy as that found in his download.  Another good 10 - 15 minutes of the show is comprised of him pausing and the audience laughing.  So of the 1 hr and 20 minutes, only about half of it is original comedy.  And none of it was as good as that found in his download.  So for me, it was not that funny.  For someone who has never seen his internet download however, this DVD is great.  The innovativeness and wit of his comedy is as good as anyone else out there in the US now.  And when it comes to racial jokes, his is the best out there.",1170460800,23,1208,4.177489177489178
2620255,5,B000GW8RYS,"I normally don't buy DVD's.  I never could understand the desire to watch something repeatedly.  Well, this DVD changed me.  My husband and I have watched it 5x already and have laughed just as hard each time.  We now plan dinner parties around the DVD just to share the laugh.  My husband and I have gotten to the point that we recite the jokes in the car.

Russell is the best comic we have ever seen.  Please make more DVD's just as good.",1169337600,3,441,4.240963855421687

2620257,5,B000GW8RYS,"If you've seen any of Russel Peters comedy, you will definitely love this DVD. If you want to see an Indian comedian perform flawless accents of various ethnic groups, check this one out. It is damn funny and probably one of the few comedians that puts other minority groups in the spotlight. It's a damn good hour or so of comedy, I laughed so I hard I had to pause it and go back because I missed the next joke.

2620259,5,B000GW8RYS,"Most people I know first heard about Russell after watching the

clip that was floating around on the internet. He's hilarious, and

it was only fair that I bought the DVD that he's been promoting for

a good year now. Some of the jokes in it are his trademark ones,

and there are a few new ones too. However, there are times in the

show that I felt that he was trying a little too hard. Overall, I
