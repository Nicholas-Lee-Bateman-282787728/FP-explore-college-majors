8598022,5,B00DUUC1EA,Eye opener unfortunately  name changes for facilities but the care never improves. Emeritus changed their name. Place you loved in a smaller facility -- 16 beds or less then they will get better care.,1446595200,,200,4.882352941176471

8598024,5,B00DUUC1EA,"I had watched this on Frontline on TV and had to have the DVD.  Both my 91 year old mother and 87 year old mother-in-law reside in independent living in one of these facilities; they both are independent, not in memory care.  In case either of their status changes, I want to be aware of what can happen!  The examples in this film just sicken me; seems that Emeritus is just in it for profit and hires some very unqualified personnel to oversee care. This is a ""must-see"" for anyone who needs to place their elders in a facility!  Do the research and be educated!",1390003200,3,564,4.3428571428571425
8598025,4,B00DUUC1EA,"This DVD really gets you thinking about what things to look for and ask if you are looking for an assisted living facilty or have a loved one in one.  It really scares you into being careful and asking the right questions.  There are good places out there, but there are those in it for the money and not following good practces.",1385596800,2,329,4.290322580645161
