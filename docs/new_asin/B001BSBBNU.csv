The scene where Delores hands her angora sweater over to Ed...oops, I mean ""Glen"", looks like someone threw tar on it. Buy one of the others, not this one, or better yet watch it for free on YT",1393027200,,364,4.2898550724637685
3499382,5,B001BSBBNU,"For those that are transgendered and/or transexual, there are actually two stories. The first story is about a crossdresser that grew up wearing his sisters clothes and then secretly wears his girlfriend's clothes, and needs to tell her. The second story is about a transgendered person that is naturally androgynous and has surgery to live as a woman.

Both stories end on a positive note, leaving positive and supporting messages!

It does mention female to male sex changes also, but there are no stories or examples of them in this film.

Keep in mind this is a very old film, so science has come a long way, and if this film was redone it could be a thousand times better.

Oddly, the film is introduced and sometimes interrupted by bela lugosi which is known for his horror films in which he stared as Dracula. He shows up in this film to treat the subject of the sexes like a modern day tale of Frankenstein.

I do like how they inserted the devil standing behind a priest when it showed two people being married, and I was impressed at how it compares ignorance with religion and that science and technology will free us from all of that ignorance.

I highly recommend this film for anyone that is transgendered or transexual, as it is an easy way to break the ice with friends and partners.",1384992000,,1299,4.553648068669528
3499383,3,B001BSBBNU,"After the major cleanup work Legend Films did on ""Plan Nine"" and ""Reefer Madness"" I was expecting ""Glen or Glenda"" to get the same treatment. Sadly I was wrong. They didn't do 1/50th the work on this film that they did on the other two. They may have jacked up the contrast a bit, but they did almost nothing to clean up scuffs and scratches on this print. And there are so many splices that words constantly disappear from sentences and even a few key lines of dialogue are GONE. I could have probably cut them some slack if they had added an audio commentary, but you don't even get THAT. So there is NO reason to recommend this over the Rhino/Image release. I am not holding my breath waiting for Criterion to do this puppy, but darn it, ""Glen or Glenda"" deserves better than this.

As for the film, it was Ed Wood's first and must deeply personal effort. The stag footage you will see in the middle during the ""dream"" was inserted by producer George Weiss to pad out the running time. In many ways it is ""worse"" than ""Plan 9"" but at the same time you also feel Ed is laying his heart and soul out for the world to see and you can't fault the man for sticking his neck out on this one. You have to see it at least once to pad out your knowledge of Ed Wood/Grade-Z/Exploitation films.

If you already own the Image edition, don't bother with the Legend Films one. If you don't own either, go with whatever is cheaper.",1360368000,3,1419,4.271375464684015

8284840,5,B001BSBBNU,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GLEN-OR-GLENDA/dp/B00003XAMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GLEN OR GLENDA</a>&nbsp;(1953) - Bela Lugosi, Edward Wood Jr., Dolores Fuller, Lyle Talbot, 'Tommy' Haynes, Conrad Brooks

Infamous movie that began Ed Wood's reign as ""worst director of all time"" is an autobiographic semi-documentary on transvestism (now called ""crossdressing""). Wood as Glen also boldly appears in his second self, here named Glenda. Fuller, playing girlfriend Barbara, is a really bad actress. Bela's ""puppy dog's tails"" speech and later ""Pull da string! Pull da string!"" narration over a superimposed buffalo herd are unforgettable. An extended sequence of wordless action with music track perhaps reveals the director's other idiosyncracies.

Here, as Glen and Barbara get married, a sports jacketed Satan nods his approval. The next curious segment is of an hourglass shaped stripper then a supine woman being whipped and bound by another girl. The previously tied up girl freely writhes on a couch in a sheer negligee, clearly aroused. A man enters and forces himself upon her; at first she resists but then kisses him back. All this as Lugosi watches with raised brows.

The sequence continues: a small crowd points accusingly at Glen and surround him as the devil urges them forward. He's now Glenda when they back away. Barbara slowly approaches but suddenly turns into Satan. Glenda recoils. An amused Barbara reappears in an overturned chair; she rises and mocks Glenda. A montage of laughers, plus their hands and grinning faces, segues to the devil repeating Lugosi's ""Beware"" soliloquy.

All this is preface to Glen's decision to reveal his dark secret to Barbara. Will she laugh for real and make Glen's nightmare a reality? Will she end their engagement? Before we find out, another case is presented plus there's lots more stock footage to use up! (Hint: Wood's story incorrectly concludes that love cures CDers.)",1425600000,,1974,5.591973244147157

8284845,5,B001BSBBNU,"Johnny Depp portrayed him in the movie of his life. And he mentions this movie throughout that film. Of course it is no Oscar contender, but a collectible for Wood's fans.
