8638300,5,B00I1PCZO0,Great video running experience. Highly recommend for people who love nature.,1521504000,,76,6.0
8638301,3,B00I1PCZO0,"The pace is too fast for a hike except where they slow it down to go through heavy vegetation.  The scenery is amazing.  I wish the scenes weren't so brief and with so many cuts to new scenes.  It would be nice to have this with complete hikes in chapters (workouts) for each segment at a length of this hike.  They filmed in enough areas to do this,  but they'd have to bring along extra batteries.  The area covered could have easily supported a week's worth of workouts.  It would also be nice to have an option for two or three types of music rather than the goofy selections on the hikes I've purchased so far (3 Hikes, one run).  The pace of this hike would be perfect for a running workout.  This is my favorite of the hikes offered, but it just isn't quite what i need when training with a pack on my back at a pace slower than a run.",1516838400,,842,4.116564417177914
8638302,5,B00I1PCZO0,Wonderful views!  Great shots of Lake Louise and the trail all the way up to the Tea Room.,1515369600,,90,4.0
8638303,5,B00I1PCZO0,This is a great work out. Quick and short intervals. Expect to get a good work out!,1436659200,,83,3.9411764705882355
8638304,5,B00I1PCZO0,"I have 7 of these Virtual Active videos and this is my favorite so far.  It's 40 minutes total (35-minutes hiking/running, 5-minute cooldown),  which makes it 5 minutes longer than the others.  I'm a slower runner and I prefer the pace of these hiking videos better than the running ones.  The music if you use it is paced for a brisk walk.  It's a sort of electronic-techno music which I really don't like, so I turn it off (in the options).

The hike/run starts in a swampy area, moves briefly through an old forest, then climbs into some pristine mountain areas.  The views from the mountain summits are awesome!  Then it travels along mountain trails (love the wildflowers) to a glacial lake.  Makes me want stop and go camping there.  The time just flies by when I do this on the treadmill.  The only things I don't like are the accompanying music trac (turn off in the options) and I do wish it was a little longer.  The only time you see other people on the ""trail"" is in the very beginning part - about 6 minutes. Most of it is wilderness.",1432512000,,1047,4.395833333333333
8638305,5,B00I1PCZO0,"I have 15 of these runs/walks so far, and I run them in front of my treadmill on a large TV. The guided runs have a trainer that pops in and out for tips and motivation. Most are only 30 or 35 minutes of ""Interval Running"". I have been a Power Walker for years and decided to try running, so thru the summer I did my 30 or 35 minutes just trying to run better, and accidently lost 10 lbs...LOL This run is longer its 45 minutes and its beautiful. I love everyone I have to this point and the run is just a little different on each. Fortunately there are more  to buy and I will probably have them all.",1420934400,,601,3.9669421487603307
