8299959,1,B001EYVXXE,"Well, I bought this DVD for my husbands birthday because he always was telling me how good the movie "" Brother from another planet "" was. He watched it in the movie theater when he was younger and wants to see it again.
I thought I will surprise him. I found this DVD as double pack, wow, 2 movies on 1 DVD, how nice for that price.
My husband was thrilled to get the movie.
"" Brother from another planet "" was okay for an older movie in this genre but the other movie "" Blue
Manhattan "" is plain junk. Its so bad, for me its not even watchable.
Also lots of disgusting language in it. So, for all of you, who don't like weird movies, stay out of it, please.",1302307200,,658,3.992424242424242
