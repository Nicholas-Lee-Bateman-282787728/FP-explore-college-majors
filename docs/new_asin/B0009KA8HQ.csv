8062543,5,B0009KA8HQ,"I like this movie, I like it very much. Yes, it is schmaltzy, it is over the top, it is crude and it is a dozen other ""bad"" things. But is is also energetic, genuinely funny, unforced, beautifully sung and totally enjoyable. I wish I could find out who the three tenor voices are. They are brilliant. And George, Danny and Joe do a magnificent job of miming.

Don't expect great things from this movie. Just relax and enjoy it. I gave it five because I really think you should buy it and when you do you will also like it!",1231286400,4,522,4.1683168316831685
