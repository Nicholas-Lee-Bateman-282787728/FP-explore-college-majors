6199534,5,B00HR6HYS6,"This is one of those films where the visuals and music are the movie.  I can't say the story is earth shattering, but between the beautiful actors, set design, music and choreography, this film was visually amazing.  Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have a chemistry that I have never seen.  I am very impressed with Mr. Bansali.  I think this is a must see.",1446681600,,360,4.578125

6199537,4,B00HR6HYS6,"Visually stunning. Great acting. Hindu version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet good, but would have preferred ancient Indian love story of LailaMajnu, because Eastern storytelling about love/tragedy is the best. I did see some elements of it in Ram-Leela, and  I found myself constantly comparing this love story to LailaMajnu, most recently essayed in Madhuri Dixit's film, Aaja Nachle. Despite this, I purchased this movie and will watch it again because I am a fan of Deepika's.",1444435200,,483,5.2727272727272725

6199551,2,B00HR6HYS6,I love Bollywood movies but surprisingly I didn't like this one. They seemed to treat the women in the story rather roughly and the ending wasn't happy. The music also didn't appeal to me. But as for the color and the beauty of the backdrops and sets they were appealing I have to admit. As for the seller the merchandise was sent to me after just four days with standard shipping and the merchandise was in perfect condition.,1420502400,7,426,4.4743589743589745

6199557,5,B00HR6HYS6,"Ram-leela is a Hindu version of Romeo and Juliet, if you love singing and dancing you will love this film even though it is in a different language you can still understand it's meaning by subtitles and the two main characters. the actors who portrayed ram and leela did it beautifully my eyes were glued to the tv screen from beginning to end. Both singing and dancing numbers to introduce the main characters were spectacular, the main characters are beautiful and the chemistry between them is HOT!!!! if you haven't seen this movie it is a must and if this is your first Hindu film it will open your eyes to something new and entertaining.",1405382400,3,643,4.6
6199558,4,B00HR6HYS6,"This is a wonderful rendition of Romeo and Juliet. The songs are beautiful, Deepika's and Ranveer's chemistry is off the charts, the scenery is stunning, I just loved this whole movie. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has been one of my favorite directors and I don't think this is as good as Devdas, Black, or Guzaarish but this is a full on masala love story and much different from Bhansali's other work. There some plot holes and over the top scenes but still it's a great movie.",1403913600,,472,4.564705882352941
6199559,4,B00HR6HYS6,There is a point in the movie when the male lead gets very emotional over Leela's leadership decisions for her tribe. It's an amazing scene. Great acting. But a little too racy for the kids to watch (bedroom scene with incense holder).,1403740800,,235,4.619047619047619
6199560,4,B00HR6HYS6,"I love Deepika Padukone!  She is an awesome actress!  The male actor was a new one to me but I enjoyed his acting.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie!",1402876800,,153,4.206896551724138
6199561,1,B00HR6HYS6,"Truly disappointing as Sanjay Leela has been favorite director, and those two main stars are much loved in other movies. I had to throw it away after attempting to fast forward. No amount of visual beauty would make me watch, keep or condone this movie. Beware if you've been touched by his other stunning masterpeices, this one is very different.",1402444800,4,347,4.8
6199562,2,B00HR6HYS6,"If I would have know this was like Romeo and Juliet, I would have not purchased it. The singing and choreography was just ok, the acting was good on Deepika's part but lacking in Ranveer",1401148800,,186,4.3428571428571425
6199563,5,B00HR6HYS6,"A brilliant  Bollywood adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet  by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, this film is a visual feast that's opulent, lush and colourful and most of all so artistically crafted to showcase 2 knockout leads that will leave you breathless and gasping for more. Ranveer Singh outdid himself portraying lover-boy Ram, who is more concerned with hanging out with his buddies in between selling porn dvds and fencing stolen cars than to be competing over criminal empires with the feuding family of Leela( Padika Padukone)! Everyone knows the outcome of the R&J classic, yet one can't help wondering if these star crossed lovers were going to live happily ever after in this adaptation! The music and dance routines were fabulous. If the old Bard was alive today he would have given it a standing ovation. Highly recommended and I hope SLB would consider making a version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew next!",1400976000,4,927,5.012987012987013
6199564,5,B00HR6HYS6,"This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The music, the dancing, the colors, the scenery- all amazing. Every ounce of detail put into this film shows and makes the backdrop of this film a beautiful tapestry. I'm a big fan of Bollywood films, I tend to watch them more than American films, so I fancy myself a pretty good judge. Deepika and Ranveer have amazing chemistry. You can practically feel the lust oozing through the screen. Deepika is such a force on the screen. And the wedding dance along with the song...I can't even put it into words. I highly recommend watching this masterpiece. And count on watching it over and over again.",1400371200,14,623,4.672727272727273
6199565,5,B00HR6HYS6,Romeo and Juliet in modern setting. Loved the colors songs and the spirit of the movie.  Too much violence and too much adult content.,1399161600,,134,4.583333333333333
6199566,5,B00HR6HYS6,"I do not know a word of Hindi, but after stumbling across a scene of this movie on Youtube I simply had to see it regardless.  The scene I saw was directed so well that I saw the whole movie without subtitles to get the full essence of the imagery even though I wouldn't understand everything.  The way the director uses light, scenery, color and music in this production is just perfection.  The dance choreography is amazing and the costumes are beautiful. Visually it is just stunning.  Obviously I can't really comment on the script or the story much as as I don't know the language, but I could grasp the story well enough- It is a modern Indian adaptation of Romeo and Julliet.  Anyone who appreciates talented film direction should have this movie in their collection.",1398988800,33,775,4.627737226277373
6199567,4,B00HR6HYS6,Deepika  shines in garba dances. The story is not very clear as to why things happen. I expected better from Sanjay Leela Bahnsali!,1397779200,4,131,4.695652173913044
6199568,5,B00HR6HYS6,I love this movie and the music is so beautiful. One of my very favorites. I'm sure you will enjoy it if you enjoy romantic love stories.,1396742400,,137,4.111111111111111
6199569,5,B00HR6HYS6,"Wonderful actors and fantastic dancing ; though
I would've liked to seen the movie developed in a better Romeo and Juliet fashion .",1396742400,,131,4.739130434782608
8634705,5,B00HR6HYS6,"Quite simply the first ""Bollywood"" movie I sat through all the way, in spite of past warnings about how ""terrible"" most films from that venue are. I'm sure there are a fair share of 'woofers' out there (the same could most definitely be said for HOLLYWOOD films, too!) But what turned me onto this movie was the musical clip, ""Tattad Tattad"", which was posted on Facebook as kind of a joke...and true, as the song-and-dance number that is Ram's (RANVEER SINGH) introduction, he kind of makes Gaston from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST seem almost humble.  The big difference is that beneath the party-boy veneer and swagger, Ram actually has a heart, and it is artfully stolen by Leela (DEEPIKA PADUKONE), the daughter of the sworn enemy of Ram's family, the matriarch who rules her family operation with a fist in a velvet glove...covered with iron spikes!

Producer/Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has given the world a sumptuous, breathtaking and appropriately melodramatic adaptation of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET, but now the Capulets and Montagues have become the ""Saneras"" and ""Rajadis"" - two warring criminal families in a village where ""the gun"" IS the law.  To say that the chemistry between Singh and Padukone bolsters the production is a lame understatement.  As with famous former Hollywood couples like Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, or Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum, it comes as no surprise that the two fell in love for real on this production.  As with the aforementioned couples, you can even pinpoint exactly where even THEY realize how into each other they are, with the sensuous and electric number, ""Lahu Munh Lag Gaya"" (which translates to ""My Lips Have Tasted Blood"" - the blood in question being love, desire, lust, however you want to put it.)

If Bhansali's mission was to belay all of the misconceptions about Indian cinema...Mission Accomplished! Even as the film comes to its beautiful yet tragic climax (as ROMEO AND JULIET must), you will not be able to get the stunning visuals, or the heartfelt performances of the two leads out of your head for a very long time to come.  Not only am I hooked on Bhansali Productions films from here on in, I'm already watching the follow-up to RAM-LEELA, the equally fantastic period costume drama, BAJIRAO MASTANI, which contains a number where Ranveer Singh, master choreographer Ganesh Acharya and Bhansali (who also writes all the music and melodies for the songs) outdid themselves by topping ""Tattad Tattad"" with the rousing song, ""Malhari"".

I don't quite understand all of the cultural references made to religious festivals and customs that are found throughout, but the emotions of the story require no translation (though I AM grateful for the English subtitles).

Thanks to RAM-LEELA, I can see myself becoming a lifetime fan of Indian cinema, and I intend to dive deeper into it after this and BAJIRAO MASTANI. If you have never seen a 'Bollywood' film before, or a really good one, may I strongly suggest you start with this one? But beware, especially if you love romantic dramas.  This could become very addictive!",1529020800,,3100,4.99031007751938
