2661906,2,B000ION794,Postpartum depressed mother being isolated in a lonely house with no support. Who leaves a baby in a crib alone in a room.  A crazy looking lady who keeps telling the man to stay away only for the man to keep going back again and again.  Just a stupid and irritating movie.,1483401600,,273,4.230769230769231
2661907,3,B000ION794,This movie was super creepy! I had to watch it a few times to understand it. My brother puked when the mom was rockin the cradle. The rest of my family couldn't finish the movie because it was so eery. I like movies that are on the lines of psychological horror. The director made a flawless blend between reality and psychological illusion and denial.,1352592000,2,352,4.515625
2661908,1,B000ION794,"Alright, let's sum up this movie in a few short simple words:

All three of the characters in this movie had problems.  The mother had post-partum depression making it extremely difficult for her to take care of her baby, the father kept having nightmares and hallucinations and was WAY too concerned for his baby like *constantly* and it got annoying real quick, and the old lady that was the neighbor kept living in the past believing an evil spirit (her dead sister) was making her pay for her sins.

I feel sorry for the baby the most.  That poor baby had to put up with parents that were either too young to handle the responsibility of having a baby, or were too screwed up mentally to handle taking care of a child.

So basically everyone had severe problems, and the poor baby is the one who suffers the most from all this.

Another major MAJOR problem with the movie is that the first hour was absolutely BORING.  That's more than half of the movie right there.  Unless you actually think a guy constantly walking back and forth between his house and his neighbors farm as he shares some short and simple words with his unusual neighbor with no unsettling atmosphere in sight is supposed to be scary.

The movie had a few moments that were good, such as when the father had a nightmare his baby was in the oven, and the part when he sees a ghostly image on his baby monitor was pretty freaky.  If you think I'm giving this crappy movie more than one star because of two above average scenes, guess again- I'm not.",1250553600,4,1522,4.442446043165468
2661909,1,B000ION794,"I am so grateful that I didn't buy this movie!!! I kept on re-winding the stupid thing, thinking I had missed something. The parts that sort of make sense, have nothing to do with the movie. It's like two different movies were thrown together and made into one. I LOVE horror movies, but the only thing about it that is horrifing is WATCHING it!!! No electricity so the movie is all dark, and hard to tell whats going on. All the time checking to make sure the baby is okay... A mother who has PPD and can't touch her baby, a husband who is so tired he can't even tell what is going on, a crazy lady who has to tell him that his baby is dead, some other baby crying too, It's just too nuts to make heads or tails of it. And when the end FINALLY comes, I was just WTF????? Worst movie I have EVER watched, and that's saying A LOT!!! Don't waste your money!",1221436800,3,855,4.095238095238095
2661910,4,B000ION794,"...If you have to think through a movie.  This is actually a pretty good ghost story.  True, this couple keeps checking the baby, but that's not all there is to it.  There is a reason for this.  This is one of those movies that gradually comes together and forms an interesting story.  The ending has impact even though presented in a subtle way, and makes you think back to things throughout the movie and you just say something like, ""Oh wow, I see"".  It does take a bit for the story to get going, so you have to be patient and just pay attention.  All that said, the acting and directing is way above average.  If you are just looking for blood and gore, maniacs wielding knives or chainsaws, people abducted and tied up, nudity, or any of that heavy action horror stuff, you won't find it here.",1204675200,11,799,4.351351351351352
2661911,1,B000ION794,We didn't get through the first half an hour. It just sucked and was hard to follow.,1198627200,2,84,4.0
2661912,1,B000ION794,"Bad acting, bad scenario ... really a stupid movie.
Save your time and money, as another reviewer said, I have wasted two hours of my life here.",1188000000,4,144,4.37037037037037
2661913,1,B000ION794,"The title of my review comes from what seems about the only dialogue in this movie which is the husband constantly, irritatingly calling his wife's name, which is, of course, Julie.  I should have heeded the opinions of the other 2 reviewers, but had already rented the movie so decided to give it a chance.  I wasted almost 2 hours of my life here.  Except for a few, (VERY FEW), creepy moments, this was one of the slowest, dullest movies I've seen.  Don't waste your time.",1187740800,4,475,4.488372093023256
2661914,1,B000ION794,I just don't understand why they continue over and over again taking a really good storyline and turning it into total trash.,1186358400,5,125,4.7272727272727275
2661915,2,B000ION794,"Don't let the cover art fool you...this is NOT a horror movie, it borders on being a HORRIBLE movie instead.  A psychological drama is more like it, with a dark look at post partem depression, guilt, and denial.  Lukas Haas plays a young father who moves his wife and infant son to a rural house to help her get over her PPD.  His only neighbor is a ditzy woman who isn't the least bit interested in being neighborly, but has a dark secret of her own.
While the ingredients could have made for a compelling movie, Tim Browns direction is so lethargic nothing ever really gels or creates true terror.  Most of the movie is spent in checking to see if the baby is alive or not crying.  Haas is weak in a difficult role while Emily Hampshire's performance as the wife is monotonous; Amanda Smith as the strange neighbor gives an adequate performance.  Not really suspenseful and mostly just dull and tedious.",1186012800,10,905,4.521472392638037
2661946,4,B000ION794,"Yeah, it was good; took awhile to figure out what was going on, but overall, a good plot and good actors.",1487289600,,105,4.0476190476190474
2661947,2,B000ION794,"Meh. Lukas Haas isn't a very good actor. His ""Witness"" days are long gone.",1486857600,,74,4.357142857142857
2661948,4,B000ION794,"Horror  movie, yes , but based more on a real psychosis which makes it all the more disturbing. The movie starts in the middle of something so right away my mind started going to work on what was going on and I had most of it figured out , but wasn't sure until the end,  so, I give the movie props for that. If you have babies or small children, do not watch this. Mine are grown, but this movie would have given me nightmares had I watched it when they were babies, especially. It would disturb me more , now , if I had Grand-babies , as well. Thats just me though. Before watching  it I thought it m8ght be more of a Rosemary's Baby sort of thing , it isn't.  The actors did a good job in giving it a very realistic feel. There's more suspense than gore , for the most part, which I appreciated.",1486598400,,798,4.031645569620253
2661949,3,B000ION794,Not a bad movie to pass the time.,1486598400,,33,3.25
2661950,3,B000ION794,"Sad movie about post partum depression, tries to be a horror movie, but doesn't make alot of sense. Dad( a wonderful Lucas Haas) has to do everything for his newborn son, while Mom won't touch him, sleeps all day, and can't even boil water or cook .But with $ tight, instead of bringing her to a hospital, which she clearly needs ( get her some Prozac!), she is brought to their new home, a creepy, run- down house instead, and gets worse. Add to this a secondary story with a crazy old woman next door. Finally, near end of movie, things finally start to come together, but I have a feeling that Lucas himself would've done a much better job with the directing than this guy did. Still, it has a creepy feel, with sense of doom about to happen around the corner.",1486598400,2,763,4.3426573426573425
2661951,4,B000ION794,Haas was excellent. For a 'scarey' movie it was very good. The surprise was not expected !,1486166400,,90,4.352941176470588

2661992,4,B000ION794,"This movie is a small gem that was destroyed by being classified as horror and being targeted to the wrong audience. It tells two stories. The secondary story is about an old woman who saw something, as a young girl that destroyed her and made in to what we would classify as a ""crazy old woman"". The primary story is about a young man who descends into madness after something that happened, but that we don't find out about until the movie is almost over. I watched it because I like horror movies, but this is more like the book Turn of the Screw, which has been re-done dozens of times in movies and TV shows: a ghost story, maybe, or a person's descent into madness. If you go by the illustration shown here, you will probably hate it. If you are into the very small niche of psychological movies, where people are destroyed by an event and descend into madness, you will like it. Since you won't know what happened (unless you read a spoiler posted by a individual here) until the end you may have to watch it again to see why I call it a small gem. (I did graduate with a Psychology degree so I fall under ""small niche"" as far as this movie goes.)",1484092800,6,1154,4.273972602739726

8147151,1,B000ION794,"One of the most excruciatingly difficult movies to get through!  A complete waste of time!  No real plot, plodding, boring storyline that ends in zero satisfaction.  Don't even consider watching this!",1516752000,,200,5.387096774193548

8147153,3,B000ION794,"The movie starts SUPER slow. The acting is SO dead pan and emotionless, during the first third of it, that it's difficult to stick it out until it gets interesting. Then the interesting doesn't really make it that much better. Yes there is a twist at the end. But that can't fully save it, in my eyes. I'd give it a  2.75  stars out of 5, if I could. So I'm rounding up to 3 stars.
Good effort at telling a different story. It just missed the mark a little.",1496534400,,457,4.066666666666666

8147156,4,B000ION794,"Amazon made a huge mistake classifying this incorrectly as Horror, but then the marketers ensured that with the ridiculous cover. Great premise even if it has been done many times before (what hasn't) but if you think its horror you begin to get annoyed at the virtual absence of the ghost-discreet is one thing but this is ridiculously subtle, but if you knew it wasn't horror you'd go with it. The saddest couple ever, and the saddest old woman ever, makes for a lot of pathos, NOT what you want in horror. It does what its trying to do very well and was damaged by the misclassification, however, it still wouldn't be populist. This is an odd genre and very (almost painfully) slow moving, so wouldn't have wide appeal. In proper context this is a moving, and unfortunately irredeemably depressing, movie.
Amazon reclassify this!!",1490659200,2,833,4.791666666666667

8147159,1,B000ION794,This was an awful movie. It was super slow from the beginning and I wanted to turn it off but I saw it has a surprise ending so I kept watching. I've never seen such a slow paced movie and slow acting too. The ending was surprising but didn't make any sense and I was left wondering what happened and how did it happen. Total waste of time.,1487894400,,340,4.014705882352941
8147160,5,B000ION794,"This movie was very well done.  It is slow at first but it pays off in the end.  It's not a horror movie but it is a great movie if you stick with it.  With all the stupid cliche' twist endings Hollywood has these days, this one is actually very good.  Lukas Hass, the 80's child actor, who has been in way too many movies to say, plays the dad who takes his wife to an out of the way home to get over her post partum depression.  It unfolds from there.  Add a old lady with a dark secret in the mix and you have this movie.  :)  I would recommend this to anyone who likes cerebral movies, if you are looking for a slasher flick.  This is not even close.  But this movie will make you think and I like that.  :)",1487289600,3,711,3.8680555555555554
