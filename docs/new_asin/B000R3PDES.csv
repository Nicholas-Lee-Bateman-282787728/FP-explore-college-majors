8198736,4,B000R3PDES,"St Clair Vision returns with another collection of original NASA documentaries. This three DVD set delivers 12 films covering the space shuttle era and NASA's early unmanned planetary probes.  Here's what you get:

Disc 1
* Jupiter Odyssey (28 minutes, 1975)
Discoveries about the Jovian system from the Pioneer 10 mission.
* Mercury: Exploration of a Planet (31 minutes)
The Mariner 10 probe delivers our first close-up glimpse of the planet Mercury.  This film is the second episode of a 13 part series entitled ""NASA at Work: Journey Through the Solar System."" One has to wonder whether St Clair Vision will release the rest of the episodes someday.  Although this film discusses the 1975 Mariner 10 mission, the opening credits feature film of the space shuttle, so the film itself probably dates from the 80`s.  Don't miss the animated mnemonic song.  This was intended to help school kids remember the names of the planets in order, but it's an amazing unintentional self-parody.  Like Sesame Street with a hangover!
* The Universe (27 minutes, 1976)
Cosmology 101. Animation is used to explain concepts like black holes.  Everything is covered, from brown dwarfs to red giants.  Tron would feel right at home.
* New Look / Old Moon (28 minutes, 1979)
The state of lunar science a decade after the first landing.
* Bonus Feature: NASA Mission Patches

Disc 2
* Planet Mars (28 minutes, 1979)
Our first glimpse of the red planet is delivered by Mariner 9 and the Viking landers.
* Opening New Frontiers (28 minutes, 1982)
The first four flight of Shuttle Columbia comprised the orbital test flight phase of the program.
* Space Shuttle - A Remarkable Flying Machine (30 minutes, 1982)
This film provides a detailed look at the shuttle program's first orbital flight. (It should have been placed before the previous film on the disc.)
* We Deliver (28 minutes, 1983)
The second quartet of shuttle missions got right down to business.  Columbia flies again in STS-5 providing the first satellite launch from a shuttle.  Challenger gets the next three flights: on STS-6 we get to see the first payload-bay spacewalk and on STS-8 a beautiful night-time launch and landing.
* Bonus Feature: Space Stamps

Disc 3
* NASA:  The 25th Year (50 minutes, 1983)
An interesting retrospective, this film  that gives equal weight to NASA's work with communication satellites, unmanned probes and aeronautical research, but suffers from a heavy-handed musical score.
* Launch and Retrieval of Satellites (19 minutes, 1984)
Chronicles the 14th shuttle flight, STS 51-A, in which the Discovery Crew uses the manned maneuvering unit to capture a damaged satellite.  Good stuff!
* Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation (45 minutes, 1986)
Very technically detailed, and appropriately sober.  It still hurts.
* Toys in Space (25 minutes, 1986)
Toys were just a small part of Shuttle Discovery's mission 51-D.  This film has everything we love about the shuttle program:  spacewalks, launching and retrieving satellites, use of the robot arm, and even Astronaut-Senator Barfin' Jake Garn!
Bonus Feature:  Earth from Space Gallery

Although the planetary science featured here has been eclipsed by subsequent missions, it's fun to see the excitement of these early discoveries.  Space Shuttle fans will find much to love here, and should be sure not to miss&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nasa-Collection-Volume-1/dp/B000MMMTH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nasa Collection-Volume 1</a>, which has a film about the 47th shuttle flight, Endeavour STS-49.

This three DVD set suffers a bit in the shadow of its predecessor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nasa-Collection-Volume-1/dp/B000MMMTH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nasa Collection-Volume 1</a>, which has the romantic early space flight missions and is also considerably longer, over 11 hours.  This Volume 2 box only delivers six hours, and could probably have fit on two DVDs.  Even so, it's a bargain at the price.

Please note:  I cannot be sure, but based on the description I think the contents of both NASA Collection volumes can be purchased at one time as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NASA-Ultimate-Collection-From-Orbit-to-Beyond/dp/B000R7G668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NASA: Ultimate Collection From Orbit to Beyond</a>.

Could St Clair Vision send us Volume 3?  There should be more material available.  Some of the Mercury and Gemini flights have not been covered, nor have Apollo mission 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14.  There should also be many Space Shuttle missions left to choose from, as well.  Here's hoping!",1201651200,8,4694,5.604815864022663
