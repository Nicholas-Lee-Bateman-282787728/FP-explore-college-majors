2005812,4,B0001JXP8Y,If you like British humor and especially Penelope Keith this series is a must.,1120694400,2,78,4.642857142857143
2005813,5,B0001JXP8Y,"To the Manor Born is a thoroughly delightful Britcom co-starring Penelope Keith (Good Neighbours, Executive Stress, No Job for a Lady) as the snooty Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a strong-willed, opinionated, blue-blood.  The series opens with Audrey, the Lady of Grantleigh Manor, having been brought down a peg or two by the death of her husband, which has necessitated the sale of the Manor (resulting in her having to take up residence in the pokey little lodge on the grounds of the estate).

As if having to leave her beloved Grantleigh isn't humiliation enough, Audrey is miffed by the fact that the new Lord of the Manor is a gauche, noveau-riche grocery store magnet--and a foreigner to boot--named Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles (Rumpole of the Bailey, The Irish R.M.)).  Richard is a self-made man who, now that he's got the money, wishes to live the life of a landed, moneyed English gentleman.  But he finds there's more--much more--involved than simply buying a beautiful old Manor, as Audrey is only too quick to point out.

As a successful, practical businessman, Richard approaches life from a very different perspective than Audrey, who having lived a life of privilege has never had to work a day.  The tension in the series arises from the radically different perspectives from which each approaches various local issues that arise, and the result is that the two are at loggerheads more often than not.

But though Audrey is quick to criticise Richard's lack of taste and his vulgar, profit-oriented motives, he is a handsome and, for all his ""faults"", charming man, and we cannot help noticing a certain jealousy on Audrey's part with respect to other women--a jealousy Audrey herself may not even realise exists (and certainly would never admit to!).  The most frequent ""other woman"" whose plans or aspirations are quashed by Audrey is her best friend, Marjory Frobisher, a dowdy, middle-aged spinster who's positively love-struck by Richard.

As for Richard, though Audrey is a constant thorn in his side, thwarting his plans and finding fault with him at every turn, we do see in him a growing admiration and fondness despite himself.  Though his feelings for her are sincere, it must be said that Audrey is the one person who has the class, the connections, and the ability to enable Richard to achieve the acceptance and respect that he, as the Lord of Grantleigh Manor, so desires.  Richard's Czechoslovakian mother (whom Audrey affectionately dubs ""Mrs. Pooh"") recognises class (and the power and open doors that accompany it) when she sees it, and is constantly trying to coax Richard in Audrey's direction.

The DVD set contains all twenty 30-minute episodes (which ran from 1979-1981).  Special features include the 30-minute 1979 Christmas special (which should be watched after disc one), plus a 30-minute profile of Penelope Keith (1999), and a 9-minute segment with Peter Bowles discussing the turning point in his career (2000).  In 1997, four new 30-minute audio episodes were written for radio (which was apparently the originally-intended medium for the series), all of which are included on the special features disc, and they are really a treat.  Unfortunately, the role of Richard was not reprised by Peter Bowles; still, the episodes (which take place at a point in time prior to the last episodes in the television series) are just as good as those in the original series, and I personally had no trouble picturing the scenes and characters in my mind's eye.  Finally, there are text-based bios.

In conclusion, this thoroughly enjoyable, relaxing series is one of the gentler, cosy comedies, and it's one which I highly recommend to fans of British comedy.",1104883200,15,3695,5.060955518945634
2005814,5,B0001JXP8Y,"Recently widowed Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, lady of stately Grantleigh Manor, discovers that her late (and unlamented) husband has left her with little income and lots of debts forcing her to sell her beloved home.  She takes comfort that Grantleigh is purchased by 'one of us' - instead of a rock star or even worse, a foreigner.  The relief is short lived when she discovers that wealthy Englishman is really a nouveau riche Czech-born grocer.  The two quickly develop a love-hate relationship despite the efforts of family and friends to match up the two.

Penelope Keith plays the domineering Audrey again displaying the talent for protraying such a character that she first showed in THE GOOD LIFE as Margo.  Ms. Keith manages to find endearing qualities in these women who could so easily be just overbearing cartoons.  Peter Bowles manages to bring the upwardly mobile Richard DeVere to life, walking the fine line between making an interesting sympathetic figure trying to understand all the unwritten rules of county society.

As is often the case in British sitcoms this is truly an ensemble cast with each member of the cast turning in stellar performences to make this series a gem to be enjoyed again and again.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys British comedy - this is one of the best.  The material is still fresh despite being 20+ years old.  The extras in this set include a Christmas special, interviews with Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles and four never filmed radio episodes.  The Christmas special is good, interviews are great, radio episodes are interesting although not up to the rest of the series.  The real treasure here are the twenty episodes themselves.",1100822400,12,1702,4.975265017667844
2005815,5,B0001JXP8Y,Penolope Keith and Peter Bowles are wonderful. They are not married though in real life. I looked it up online. I wish that they were though because they make a wonderful couple don't they? I love this show because it is relaxing to watch and the countryside is beautiful. I wish we had stuff like that in the United States. I recommend this show to anyone.,1099353600,10,357,4.424242424242424
2005816,5,B0001JXP8Y,"Many years ago, I caught the tail-end of one of the latter episodes of TO THE MANOR BORN on PBS and liked what I saw, which was enough to spur me to buy this series on DVD when it became available.  I'm happy I did, it is more than worth the price. The two lead actors, Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles have appeared in many other BBC productions (Rumpole, Good Neighbors). I believe they are married in ""real"" life, and thus a commedic team ala Lucy and Desi or George and Gracie, though not as zany.  Audrey Forbes-Hamilton (Keith) is a sophisticated snob and Richard Devere (Bowles) a self made immigrant whom Audrey deems not in her league, let alone worthy of Grantleigh Estate, her old ancestral home.

In the opening episode, the newly widowed Audrey is relishing the thought of being on her own without the husband she did not particularly care for.  We learn in a later episode that the Forbes-Hamilton family has intermarried for generations and this might explain some of the peculiar behavior of Audrey and her Uncle who plays an important role in the last few episodes. Audrey soon discovers her now deceased husband kept a few secrets from her, such as the debt the estate had incurred using the ""old"" methods of managing an estate (keeping hedgerows for example). Devere buys Grantleigh at an auction, outbidding Audrey, who had secured a goodly amount from her relatives for the purpose of keeeping the estate ""in the family"".

After losing her home, we soon discover Audrey has taken up residence along with the ancient family butler Brabinger in the ""lodge"", a building on the estate just up the road from the manor house, where the hired help once lived. As Richard's new neighbor, Audrey continues to offer advice on how Grantleigh should be managed according to the rules of 'Noblesse Oblige.'

Fans of `Waiting for God' will recognize the actor who plays Audrey's ""fill-in"" butler as the man who played Basil Makepeace (Makepiece?) on the ""Waiting for God"" series. He ""fills in"" when Audrey's own butler is away visiting relatives, although from his appearance it seems he was probably pretty sick and they kept the role open for him. The GOD series was made in the early 1990s when Thatcherite changes were already in place, giving Diana Trent somethig to bash. (For those who may not remember -- Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan shared similar political positions and their legacies are similar:). MANOR was created in the 1980s and in many ways seems to be an attempt to understand and appreciate that not all business people are bad (just some of them) while taking pot shots at the British class system. Is it a coincidence that the ""commoner"" Devere (a miscreant in Audrey's eyes) has made his fortune as a grocer?  Given Margaret Thatcher's origins, this allusion must have had a special appeal in the 1980s. By the end of the series, Audrey has learned a few things from Richard and `All's Well that Ends Well.""

I highly recommend this series.  I found it to be one of the best BBC/PBS series I've watched recently, and I am a huge BBC/PBS fan.",1094256000,49,3077,4.725746268656716
2005817,5,B0001JXP8Y,"'To the Manor Born' is one of the better Brit-coms, witty and intelligent without being over-the-top or inaccessible.  It has an oh-so-British tone to it, deliberately so, as it looks with grace and humour at the clash of cultures in modern Britain, the clash between tradition and modernity (finding out that neither is always what it seems), as well as the clash between social classes.  All of this is done in such a light-hearted manor, er, manner, that one scarcely realises the biting and insightful satire that runs alongside the comedic situations.

The series begins as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a straight-backed, upper-crust woman of breeding who revels in her situation, is celebrating the funeral of her husband (yes, celebrating).  Meanwhile, Richard Devere, wealthy (read, nouveau riche) financial officer heading a multinational conglomerate of food stores, arrives in the village in search of a classic gentleman's period home in the English countryside.  As Audrey's husband was not one to keep up with the bills, she discovers that she is in fact bankrupt, and is forced to sell the manor.  Richard Devere buys it at auction; Audrey is a surprising twist retains the estate's hunting lodge down the road, and the stage is set for the tensions between new homeowner and historical lady of the manor.

Supplementing the main characters are Audrey's best friend Marjorie, who variously has designs on Richard Devere, but these are almost always thwarted; Richard's mother, Mrs. Pu (Poluviska, actually, but the name is reduced for ease by Audrey); Ned, the traditional groundskeeper who helps keep the traditions alive with Audrey; and finally, Brabinger, the quintessential English butler, who relocates to the old lodge with his mistress Audrey, and always has a few suprises up his sleeve.

There are twenty-one episodes in all, filmed and broadcast over a two-year period in 1979-1981.  These run from the start of Audrey's losing the manor through to her regaining the manor, along with the hand of Richard in marriage, but not by the means often expected throughout the series.  Throughout the episodes, Audrey is constantly introduced to 'ordinary life', from having to rely on the National Health for her doctor rather than private-pay, personal service, to having difficulties in shopping in supermarkets (Devere's, as it turns out) and not being able to entertain as she once did, or go on holiday (this makes for perhaps the best episode of the lot, save for the first and final episodes).  Meanwhile, Devere gets lessons in being lord of the manor by the ever-present Audrey, who counsels him on everything from horse-purchasing to community responsbilities.  Despite his wealth, Audrey says, 'he is still at the bottom of it all a grocer.'  This is a biting commentary -- the upper-class disdain for the working class is an undercurrent here, and the entitled/en-nobled folk in Parliament used to insult both Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who were both children of shopkeepers, by using the term 'grocer' to describe them.

From the threadbare carpets to the when-we-were-in-India knick-knacks to the church clock that never worked properly, this is a wonderfully crafted comedy trip through a slice of British culture that is both past and future.  These are not 'issues' episodes -- 'To the Manor Born' educates by stealth.  One might be completely unaware of having been taught ways of acting and being.  Grantley Manor is a perfect backdrop (shot in a town with the very English-sounding name of Cricket St. Thomas), and the actors are perfectly selected.  Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton has the kind of mannerisms and deadpan delivery befitting a displaced socialite; Peter Bowles has the blustering presence as a self-assured businessman flustered in his new environment.  Old Ned (played by MIchael Bilton) and Brabinger (John Rudling) are perfected cast in both physical type and acting ability.  Angela Thorne as Marjorie Frobisher, the life-long friend of Audrey, always in her shadow, is great as the 'straight man' against whom Audrey's humour unfolds.

The DVD release contains special features including bits about Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, as well as excerpts from the late-90s radio broadcasts on BBC2.

This is a perfect show, certain to win the heart of any Anglophile.",1091491200,195,4336,5.217579250720461

Some have found fault with the image quality of these episodes, but we have found that, as a rule, the British do not re-issue higher resolution versions of their older programs.

To the Manor Born entails the snooty conversations of the Lady of the Manor and her sometimes over the top expectations.
The husband plays the calm cool collected foil for his oftentimes egregious spouse.
Nonetheless, this is one comedy I would miss if it were not in my esteemed collection.
This will give others an inside look as to how certain members of British High Society endure.
It lends to ridicule of the High Class but in a cherished way.",1487894400,2,539,4.74468085106383

Maybe because they have such a long dramatic history and so many brilliant poets and writers, the actors are as talented. It's almost an innate quality that actors of different cultures have to study hard to achieve.
It all comes so naturally to English actors, I'm always amazed. As I love mostly comedy, I can say that this show portrays extremely well the acute struggle to maintain one's heritage and traditions, almost at any cost. Never submitting to the reality of being a mere mortal, but someone always important even when unfortunately becoming destitute. And while climbing back with determination each rang of the wealthy social ladder, the main character finds herself in many hilarious situations that are of course, most of the time beneath her.

2005953,4,B0001JXP8Y,"The setting is in a fictional English village, Grantleigh, residing inside the fictional town of Marlbury in Somerset, England. The locals in this quaint countryside are a bit quirky. In the first scene, Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles), a stranger to the town and among the ""nouveau riche"", meets the town Vicar at the local parish church to ask for directions and where he might meet Mr Forbes-Hamilton. To which the Vicar replies, that Mr Forbes-Hamilton ""will be here at any moment now (but) I doubt you'll get much out of him."" And then Mr DeVere sees some pall-bearers carrying a casket. From the get-go, this is the kind of irreverent yet refreshing humour which permeates the entire show.

Mr DeVere is looking for some real estate to buy in the area and learns that the manor house is owned by the late Mr Forbes-Hamilton and his opinionated and talkative wife, Audrey. Audrey Forbes-Hamilton (Penelope Keith) is a fast-talking aristocrat who would tell a perfect stranger he looks retched because he bought his clothes at the British-equivalent of Sears. Her family, the Forbes-Hamilton's, have lived in the manor house in the English countryside since the time of Queen Elizabeth I. After laying her husband to rest, she tells the vicar that it was a ""lovely funeral, we must have another one sometime."" Now she has to sell the manor because of debts. And who should buy the manor but Ricard DeVeer, the new stranger who is not only wealthy and non-aristocrat but was ""dressed like a chessboard"" according to Audrey at the funeral reception. He then makes an unexpected offer: Audrey may continue to reside at the manor if she wishes, and she accepts the offer, beginning one of the more entertaining sitcom's of its type. DeVeer and Mrs. Forbes-Hamilton become sort of reluctant bedfellows in a kind of clash of the classes, in this case old aristocracy versus bourgeoisie.

A delightful British comedy in which the many lines are simultaneously unexpected and yet fit each character's personality. Peter Bowles plays ""straight-man"" to the quirky characters of the town. But it's the sharp-tongued Penelope Keith as Audrey Forbes-Hamilton who steals the show. Keith is perfectly cast as Audrey whose biting rhetoric would give any politician significant cause to run and hide under a nearby bed. Not to be missed if you like British comedy of this sort.",1433894400,2,2362,4.962121212121212

2006035,5,B0001JXP8Y,"Without a doubt the most English sitcom you will ever find!  ""To the Manor Born"" is a rare breed: a romantic-sitcom set in the heart of an extremely traditional English community centered on a manor house.  At the center of the show is Audrey fforbes-Hamilton (Penelope Keith), recently widowed and recipient of her ancestral family pile Grantleigh Manor.  Unfortunately, she is bankrupt and has to begrudgingly sell the manor (and all it's traditions and customs) to an upstart businessman Richard DeVere (Peter Bowls) who moves into the manor with his mother Mrs. Poulovica (Daphne Heard).  She moves all of a couple hundred feet away to the manor lodge to keep an eye on this newbie lord of the manor and is not afraid to pick a fight with him over his manhandling of the sacred traditions and customs of this little community.  Audrey is helped by her sole retainer from the manor, her butler Brabinger (John Ruddling) and her life-long school friend Marjory (Angela Thorne).
Many elements make this show work... the country-manor setting, the cast but most of all the cat-and-mouse will they/won't they relationship between Audrey and Richard.  Audrey takes the traditions of her tight-knit country community very seriously and is extremely affronted that a city businessman is now owner and lord of the manor, however from the very first we see the spark of something that could turn into a romance, but not before a good many arguments and scrapes between them on how Richard is running things.  Audrey may raise hell over Richard's poor handling of or complete indifference to a particular tradition (be it farming practices, a hunt ball, or attending church even something as mundane as a fireplace!) but at the end of the day they manage to charm each other into submission or a truce.  Penelope Keith (oh that great, imperious, aristocratic voice!) and Peter Bowls have great chemistry together and the rest of the cast fill out the show nicely, with many endearing supporting characters that add charm and background to this little community.  The original show ran from 1979 to 1981 and came back for a delightful one-off Christmas special in 2007, with a new twist to the enduring romance of Audrey and Richard.
Watch for a really good look at a quintessential country-manor community and a very classy romance that never fails to charm and make you smile.",1410393600,2,2370,4.934673366834171

I did not expect them to be digitally remastered or improved, based on a thorough reading of the product description and an appreciation for watching classics in their original format.

What a marvelous surprise this was!  Love the 70's feel of the show and the hilarious portrayal of Penelope Keith of the displaced widow who spends most of her time scheming to get back in her rightful place.  Peter Bowles (of the Irish R.M. and many others) is the perfect foil for Keith and spends most of his time looking befuddled at all of her nutty machinations, but the end result is both charming and laugh-out-loud funny as the two spar over this and that until they finally get together in the end.

She tries to teach the new owner about the proper behavior of the Peers of the realm, with hilarious results.

You'll love Penelope Keith as Audrey, driving around in her old Rolls, or demonstrating her sense of duty to the villagers. Best of all is when she contrives to get next to the new owner of the manor. Is she looking for romance or revenge? A bonus is the 25th anniversary episode, which I didn't care for quite as much as the three-disc series, but as a fan, it was certainly enjoyable.

I hadn't seen the series on TV when it was new, and bought the collection recently thinking I'd probably enjoy it because it was so well reviewed.  The problem isn't so much that I didn't think it was funny, which I didn't, but worse the same predictable situations repeat, and after one disk, you've pretty much seen what there is.  The character played by Penelope Keith is tiresome, in my opinion, but the shows might have seemed a lot funnier in the late 1970's or early 80's when they were made.  Peter Bowles's role is more subtle, more dry, not begging for laughs.  Small footnote, the actress playing his mother was the old nanny in a couple of episodes of the original Upstairs Downstairs, in which she looked and acted like a nanny from the time of Queen Victoria.",1316995200,5,895,4.5625

2006166,5,B0001JXP8Y,"this brit-com which began in '78 was a bit old-fashioned (even for its time), very british, and extremely well-done! the humor is a bit dry and reserved, sparking up to a saucy level only occasionally and only for a moment or two. but it is still very funny, charming and easy to love. the premise was inspired by a very real dilemma plaguing England at the time. old family concerns with passing wealth (title families or people with land, grand manors or castles, etc.) were dying off...and with no continuing income, their debts had to be paid by selling their traditional manors, estates or castles....and the nouveau riche (Japanese, arabs or rock stars) were buying these ancestral homes with no regards to the old traditional way of life.
enter our heroine, audrey fforbes-hamilton (played to perfection by penelope kieth) who is overjoyed that the passing of her husband will mean she can run her estate the way she wants according to the tradition of her heritage....until she learns she must sell the manor to settle her husband's debts. the manor is bought by nouveau-riche richard devere (played equally as well by peter bowles). he is a self-made millionaire owner of a new supermarket chain who plans to turn the manor into an office complex for his grocery empire, while audrey is reduced to living in a shack at the edge of the estate. sparks fly as audrey constantly rushes over to complain about richard's disregard for tradition and heritage.....of course, audrey's rants are a thin veil disguising her infatuation for the charming, suave new owner.....and richard often bends to audrey's will because he too feels something between them. the clash between the traditional and the new-fangled is the main draw to the show....but the undercurrent of the subtly developing romance of these 2 main characters also draws you in. kieth and bowles have an excellent on-screen chemistry....and you can't help hoping that for all their squabbling, these 2 crazy kids will eventually hit it off and get hitched....again, the humor is a bit dry and reserved.....even for its time it was a bit old-fashioned. however, the premise, the writing, the cast (including richard's czech mother played by daphne heard and brabinger the butler played by john rudling), the episodes, the pacing, the way they balanced the clash between traditional and the new....everything about this show was handled with skill, humor and class....right to the spectacular end. and they couldn't have ended the show any better!
this collection included the '70s christmas episode which i'd never seen before...and the 25th anniversary special which i never even knew about. these shows were done with the same great work as all the regular episodes. although i am a big fan of how tv and movies are today, i cannot say enough about how wonderful this old-fashioned brit-com of the late '70s and early '80s was! i am so glad i got this collector's edition! and i can heartily recommend it to anyone with a taste of good old british humor and class!",1305590400,,3030,4.954813359528488

I loved it and find that I still do.  I rated it 4 instead of 5 for technical reasons, because in the middle of the last DVD, there's a defect, and the DVD stalls and if I FF it past the stall, it has lines blipping across the screen occasionally for a while (this was on two different DVD players, so it's the DVD and not my player).

If you are a lover of British Comedy, this will be a favorite series to own , watch and rewatch.  Penelope Keith and Peter Boyle keep the stories rolling along swiftly, without any breaks in tradition.  The supporting cast is outstanding. Rather than slapstick reinforced comedy, this series depends upon it's creative writing and flawless performances by all involved.

Unless a young viewer has been exposed to classic comedy, they might find the series a bit dated, but the more experienced viewer (okay, okay... older viewer) will see past some of the ""old fashioned"" morality issues, the fashions and some of the grammar framing in proper English dialog.

So... put on your dressing gown, make yourself comfortable in a richly grained, leather wing chair facing a crackling fire in your antique fireplace, lite a bowl of a cherry scented tobacco, pour a snifter of brandy, stroke your golden retriever and get ready to laugh yourself silly.

2006205,5,B0001JXP8Y,"I was introduced to this series on a PBS station in Houston, Texas so I was well aware of what I was purchasing.  The tension/attraction between Richard and Audrey is a proper foundation for comedic situations.  Richard's mother and Audrey's best friend are reminders of the extreems of the differences between the two main characters-hard working ""nouveau riche""(Richard) and ""old money""(Audrey).  Though certainly not intended, the series could be seen as a compairison of British society (Audrey) and American culture (Richard).  Audrey's preference for all things Brithish is reflected by one of the memorable coments she makes.  It's an ethnocentric take on an old cliche'.  ""It's fine to do things a certain way when in Bratislava (Richand's home town in Czechoslovakia) but when in Rome, he should do as the British do!""

2006217,5,B0001JXP8Y,"Droll British humor at a peak. One-liners a-plenty. The humorous character interaction is quick and ""spot-on."" And the Silver Anniversary Special (2007) even tops the outstanding 3-year sit-com. 1979-1981.

The barbs and constant badgering of Audrey (Penelope Keith) with grocer magnate and Grantleigh Manor's new owner, Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles) brings on laughs, not smiles. Oh, sure, there are some tender moments, since Richard actually likes Audrey and wants to be a good laird of the manor, but it's the aristocratic bits of verbal bite from Audrey's mouth that makes the series. Another character pairing just as good is that of Audrey and her friend, Marjory (Angela Thorne). That duo is something very like the past, long-running American teamwork of Johnny Carson & Ed McMahon. Like Ed, Marjory gets her own share of pointed remarks expressed, but the air of Audrey seems never to catch them. It's a stretch, but Aubrey could be likened to an Aristocracy-British-Female version of Steve Martin. Constant fast witty jokes.

This series pits the new rich against old wealth. British aristocratic VS Czech/Polish immigrant.  Upstart with a desire to ""fit in"" against 400 years of perfected snobbery. ""He's got the money; I've got the breeding."" That's conflict that made this great sit-com fun for 3 seasons.

The series is delightful and has the nostalgic flavor of the decade change from 70's to 80's. Even the canned laughter, at first seeming a disturbance when one is used to mostly watching films rather than TV, becomes acceptable. Subtitles would have been a plus, but not really a must, and the anniversary special disc does have that available.

Sharing one of the best barbs from the script is perhaps the best way to recommend this DVD set. After a Grantleigh Manor guest was served a plate of overcooked food, he stated, ""Ah, Emmeridge, excellent. My compliments to the blacksmith.""",1233100800,4,1906,5.115755627009646

By the time you combine all of the new footage, it's like a whole new episode.  Then there is the famed grandfather clock.  She assumed that it was an English antique.  WIth the clarity of DVD she was actually able to see for the first time that it is a beautifully intricate Chinese Clock.  And don't forget the anniversary show is in this pack, as well.  FANTASTIC!

2006223,4,B0001JXP8Y,"The series is marvelous, however what I've received on DVDs is disappointing, first of all because of the lack of subtitles (and I'm pretty sure that the information on the product stated that English subtitles were to be there, and for me this is an important issue, since I am not a native speaker and though the pronounciation is mostly impeccable, sometimes the subtitles would do good esp. for the less advanced English listener). Secondly the quality of the film is bad. There are lots of ""hiccups"" when instead of a smooth movement, there are sort of jerks, and also the colours are not particularily good. Still, me and my family love this series and we enjoy watching it very much .

A corrigendum !:
Some of the above mentioned problems with the film may result from the fact that I've bought a Region 1 DVD and I have to watch it on my computer since (to my frustration) in Poland it is not possible to get DVD player that would accept Region 1 plates. What's more I've just found that I can launch subtitles as if ""from within"" Vista operational system. This option is somehow not achievable straghforwardly from main menu of the film. Anyway, as a result, I feel obliged to withraw or et least suspend my objections and without any hesitation I wholeheartedly recommend this series.",1223251200,8,1295,4.655021834061135

2006236,5,B0001JXP8Y,"'To the Manor Born' is one of the better Brit-coms, witty and intelligent without being over-the-top or inaccessible. It has an oh-so-British tone to it, deliberately so, as it looks with grace and humour at the clash of cultures in modern Britain, the clash between tradition and modernity (finding out that neither is always what it seems), as well as the clash between social classes. All of this is done in such a light-hearted manor, er, manner, that one scarcely realises the biting and insightful satire that runs alongside the comedic situations.

The series begins as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a straight-backed, upper-crust woman of breeding who revels in her situation, is celebrating the funeral of her husband (yes, celebrating). Meanwhile, Richard Devere, wealthy (read, nouveau riche) financial officer heading a multinational conglomerate of food stores, arrives in the village in search of a classic gentleman's period home in the English countryside. As Audrey's husband was not one to keep up with the bills, she discovers that she is in fact bankrupt, and is forced to sell the manor. Richard Devere buys it at auction; Audrey is a surprising twist retains the estate's hunting lodge down the road, and the stage is set for the tensions between new homeowner and historical lady of the manor.

Supplementing the main characters are Audrey's best friend Marjorie, who variously has designs on Richard Devere, but these are almost always thwarted; Richard's mother, Mrs. Pu (Poluviska, actually, but the name is reduced for ease by Audrey); Ned, the traditional groundskeeper who helps keep the traditions alive with Audrey; and finally, Brabinger, the quintessential English butler, who relocates to the old lodge with his mistress Audrey, and always has a few suprises up his sleeve.

There are twenty-one episodes in all from the original series 25 years ago, filmed and broadcast over a two-year period in 1979-1981. These run from the start of Audrey's losing the manor through to her regaining the manor, along with the hand of Richard in marriage, but not by the means often expected throughout the series. Throughout the episodes, Audrey is constantly introduced to 'ordinary life', from having to rely on the National Health for her doctor rather than private-pay, personal service, to having difficulties in shopping in supermarkets (Devere's, as it turns out) and not being able to entertain as she once did, or go on holiday (this makes for perhaps the best episode of the lot, save for the first and final episodes). Meanwhile, Devere gets lessons in being lord of the manor by the ever-present Audrey, who counsels him on everything from horse-purchasing to community responsbilities. Despite his wealth, Audrey says, 'he is still at the bottom of it all a grocer.' This is a biting commentary -- the upper-class disdain for the working class is an undercurrent here, and the entitled/en-nobled folk in Parliament used to insult both Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who were both children of shopkeepers, by using the term 'grocer' to describe them.

From the threadbare carpets to the when-we-were-in-India knick-knacks to the church clock that never worked properly, this is a wonderfully crafted comedy trip through a slice of British culture that is both past and future. These are not 'issues' episodes -- 'To the Manor Born' educates by stealth. One might be completely unaware of having been taught ways of acting and being. Grantley Manor is a perfect backdrop (shot in a town with the very English-sounding name of Cricket St. Thomas), and the actors are perfectly selected. Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton has the kind of mannerisms and deadpan delivery befitting a displaced socialite; Peter Bowles has the blustering presence as a self-assured businessman flustered in his new environment. Old Ned (played by MIchael Bilton) and Brabinger (John Rudling) are perfected cast in both physical type and acting ability. Angela Thorne as Marjorie Frobisher, the life-long friend of Audrey, always in her shadow, is great as the 'straight man' against whom Audrey's humour unfolds.

Much to the delight of fans, many of the regulars reunited to produce a Silver Anniversary special, which shows the progress after a quarter of a century for Audrey and Richard, neighbour Marjorie Frobisher, and even the same befuddled rector.

There is an earlier DVD release that does not contain the Silver Anniversary special.  If you have that packaging already, you only really need to get the separate DVD of the special.  If, however, you have yet to purchase this gem (or have it on VHS), you would put a real touch of class into your life by getting this series.

This is a perfect show, certain to win the heart of any Anglophile.",1221868800,20,4771,5.12998712998713

2006238,5,B0001JXP8Y,"To the Manor Born is the second best Britcom behind Butterflies.  Twenty five years has passed since Audrey and Richard finally tied the knot.  This rerelease is the fantastic orignal series plus the new 25th Anniversary Christmas special (which has not been shown in the US!!)

This dvd set contains all 21 episodes from the original 3 series plus the 25th Anniversary hourlong special.

Audrey fforbes-Hamilton's (Penolope Keith) husband has passed away (but she is really not mourning it). He has left her virtually penniless and she must save her family home (which she is mourning).  The manor is sold to a self made foreign millionaire, Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles).  While Audrey despises everything Richard stands for but there is definite sexual tension between them.  With help of best friend Marjorie (Angela Thorne) and Richard's mother, Mrs. Poo (Daphhe Heard), Richard and Audrey will find happiness.  The series finale ends with two happy endings (I won't spoil it but it will not surprise you.)

Jump 25 years later, it's the Dever's 25th Wedding Anniversary and Audrey is going to celebrate it in style but it is going to take everyone's effort to save the day and the town.

This is one of the best comedy series ever (British or American).  It has witty writing, razor sharp direction and a perfect cast.  Penelope Keith has proven to be one of Britan's great comic geniouses (she has had over half a dozen hit comedies.)

The estate gets bought Richard Devere (Bowles) an eccentric millionaire in the food business.  Moving into a small cottage on the estate, Audrey with help from her friend Marjorie and her butler spends the next few years doing everything her power to get her ancestral home and place in society back including falling in love with the new ""Lord of the Manor"".

2006243,2,B0001JXP8Y,"Although I'm a diehard fan of this great British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be better than nothing, but not by much

I was also disappointed in the extras. The ""character biographies"" weren't of the characters in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD.

The radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the TV screen. This can lead to screen burning on some sets.",1174262400,19,1370,4.497991967871486

2006258,5,B0001JXP8Y,"A rich and striking widow becomes poor with a parvenu purchasing her ancestral estate.  She moves into a cottage close the palatial estate. The widow and parvenu interact; hilarity ensues, class and breading are examined.  Social conflicts are abound.  The boredom of the gentrifying British countryside is magnified. The widow and the parvenu fall in love.  A copycat cheap romance novel, perhaps?  No, brilliant British comedy called ""To the Manor Born"".

Audrey fforbes-Hamilton (played by Penelope Keith) takes control of her dead husband's home, Grantleigh Manor. She finds that the estate is heavily in debt and that the creditors insist on selling the estate. When the estate is put up for auction, she hopes that the all family members will rally around and raise the money to buy the estate, but she is unable to raise enough. She is horrified when the purchaser turns out to be Richard de Vere (Peter Bowles). De Vere is not only 'a nouveau riche grocer' - he owns a supermarket chain - but a foreigner. The worst thing that can happen to the landed British gentry!  His real name is Bedrich Polouvicki, and both he and his mother, Mrs. Polouvicka (Daphne Heard) are originally from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. They both take up residence in the manor.

Audrey, able to retain only the services of her butler, Brabinger (John Rudling) and her vintage Rolls Royce, buys the Manor's former gatekeeper's lodge (""this rabbit hutch"") which DeVere had originally intended buying before the manor house came on the market. From the ""Old Lodge"" (as it is known) she can keep an eye on developments at the manor. Her best friend Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) also has eyes for Richard. Audrey soon sets about teaching Richard the concept of noblesse oblige and working her way back into the life of the manor, whilst dealing with the awkwardness of maintaining the social graces - and simply keeping body and soul together - without any money. Eventually, Richard develops romantic designs, but Audrey will not consider marriage unless she is mistress of her own fortunes.

In due course, Richard is forced to sell the manor to fund a business deal, and he returns to London. Coincidentally, Audrey's rich Uncle Greville (Ballard Berkeley, who played The Major in Fawlty Towers) dies and leaves his fortune to her. So she is able to buy back the manor. Richard is invited to the party to celebrate her good fortune and they agree to marry.

To have this compiled in one collection (finally) is simply fantastic.  I had originally purchased the individual sets in the UK, for far more, so one is definitely getting their money's worth with this set and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

2006261,5,B0001JXP8Y,"This show is more than just a great tv show, it actually was a reflection of the change in the social class of the british society.

Audrey Fforbes Hamilton was recently widowed and now must face the music.  Her estate is bankrupt.  She must sell the ancestoral home (actually her husband's ancestoral home, her background is never discussed).  If she can't have it, then some one class should.  But not a foriegn self made millionaire.

Enter sexy Richard DeVere (a foriegn self made millionaire).  The sparks fly (both kinds) and Audrey is always there to remind Richard of his duty to the manor.

To round out the cast is Richard's Czech mother, Audrey's best friend Marjorie, the domestics Brabinger the bulter and Ned the handyman plus the local inhabitants including the vicar and the major.

Each disc a a different season.  Disc 1 is Richard settling in.  There is a great episode where Richard is buying a horse and Audrey's advice is if you run into a horse named Utter Rubish, buy him immediately.

Disc 2 is Richard trying to improve the manor farm to Audrey's chagrin.  And for those who want to see Rula Lenska outside of her Alberto VO5 commericails, she is the guest on episode 11.

Disc 3 is the final season and Richard must fight to save his business and his blossoming relationship with Audrey.  Audrey's blacksheep Uncle Greville becomes a key part the final shows.  The last episode is a classic on its own.

Disc 4 is the special material including the Christmas Special, docs on the two stars and four radio plays.
