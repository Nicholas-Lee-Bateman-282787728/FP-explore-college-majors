1972433,3,B00015HX1S,"This 2002 TV movie is based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel that won some accolades a few years ago.  I usually like Joyce Carol Oates and tried to read the book.  But I was bored and just couldn't get into it.  I always did wonder, however, how the story turned out.  And so I was glad to see it was on DVD.

Starring Blythe Danner as the mother and Beau Bridges as the father, we first meet the Mulvaneys as a happy family with four teenage children.  It's storybook happiness, the kind that doesn't happen in real life and now I know why I was bored with the book.  And then, when something bad happens, it tears the family apart.  In a matter of weeks, all the happiness goes down the drain and each family member suffers in his or her own way.  The audience suffers too as this part goes on and on and on with one misfortune leading to another until several years pass and the father is dying.  By now, everyone is miserable.  But this seems to lead the family to reconciliation and a new beginning.

The film is pure soap opera and rather depressing.  However, it moved quickly and I got involved in the story, wanting to see how it would all turn out.  Later, I wondered what it was that held my interest and I think it was the way it was paced and the excellent acting although it doesn't even make the playing field of good film drama.",1082764800,12,1341,4.207843137254902

1972446,1,B00015HX1S,"I'd watch Jacob Pitts eat paint (although I don't want him to) and I love Joyce Carol Oates but this was one of the worst movies ever made. The subject - rape - very serious. The plot - ridiculous and unbelievable . A movie from 2002 that had a '70's feel to it, in a very negative way. Don't want to say more in case of spoiling but the movie ranged from bilious (the perfect, adorable, romping, hair mussing ""before"" family with Blythe Danner in overalls & a rich woman's job of ""selling""antiques but she doesn't sell any because she can't deal with parting with them (awww) but she can deal with throwing rape-victim daughter out of her perfect,adorable home to HITCHHIKE (good choice for someone whose been raped )for years around the country; to the good natured, "" before"" Dad, the "" oh we're so blessed"", guffawing Beau Bridges;to the kids who are ciphers except for Tammy Blanchard who could make anything sound almost believable - man, that girl/woman can act and of course Jacob Pitts who is just........mesmerizing and he's mesmerizing doing anything. And it's not just because he's a visual picnic. He's also a very very very fine actor.) to just jaw droppingly offensive. You'd laugh at the ending if you didn't feel so guilty laughing at the subject - and I can say no more. Except....oh, Jacob Pitts. Jacob Pitts. Why isn't there more Jacob Pitts.
BTW, I haven't reviewed every season of Justified because it's just too painful right now. Suffice to say - never has there been a show that good and that gave the audience that much. And, of course, gave the audience - Jacob Pitts. Where is our Justified spin off, starring Jacob Pitts?",1452816000,,1650,4.654109589041096

1972451,4,B00015HX1S,"Naturally the book is better, but out of curiosity I ordered the DVD to see the casting and how it would translate to film.
I think the actress that played Marianne was perfect, just as my mind had imagined her. Pinch and the Father pretty good too. Not so much with Corinne and the other two sons and other characters.
Highpoint farm was not the signature color, and they never showcased all the animals ( as in the book.) Some crucial parts are gossed over or plain left out, but this is only a made for tv movie that is 1 1/2 hours.
It is very good, just not great like the book. Worth watching for sure!",1423094400,,607,4.196581196581197

1972461,5,B00015HX1S,"Unlike the other people writting this review. I liked this movie because it shows what happens when other people hurt someone. It dosnt just hurt one,but often many. The movie had great actors in it and showed how this family finally came back together. Although not without alot of changes",1316908800,6,290,4.82

1972463,1,B00015HX1S,"This was the first time I was disappointed in an Amazon.com order.  It was advertised as closed captioned -- there was no closed captioned; there was no trailer gallery as advertised.  The special features were missing, leading me to believe that this was not a professional copy but a ""bootleg"" home video reproduction.  POOR QUALITY.",1121904000,2,335,5.054545454545455

8006848,4,B00015HX1S,"Great but sad story of a family who had success, great love, a beautiful farm, lot's of dogs. But one decision by the youngest daughter opened a door for evil to transpire. After being raped, she refused to testify leaving her father distraught. The other 4 boys all reacted as most would. Anger, confusion, rage and great conflict came over this family. Faith was tested and failed. A marriage fell apart. A young victim was sent away. One son joined the military, the other went away to college. The youngest narrates the story. It is a study of a family but ultimately of survival. Slowly new love comes, healing begins, forgiveness comes and a new chapter starts. I am sure the book held more details but to me, this movie is worth a view. Ends very well. Enjoy!!",1522022400,,767,4.565217391304348

8006850,5,B00015HX1S,"I've read the book and then I knew I just had to watch the movie. Fantastically well done! This movie made me cry! The true meaning of family, cherish it. At times, it may not seem like God is here, but He is. ",1496534400,,210,3.883720930232558
8006851,5,B00015HX1S,"I loved this book by Joyce Carol Oates, and this production is every bit as good as the book! Blythe Danner is fantastic as the loving wife trying to hold her family together after tragedy strikes, and Beau Bridges is equally great as the man who ""falls from grace"" as a devoted husband and father into an emotional mess of a man. It is sad, but beautifully acted, including the roles of the children caught in the consequences of a tradegy they could not prevent.",1490486400,,464,4.470588235294118

8006855,5,B00015HX1S,I read this book. It was on Oprah's book club.  The movie really did the book justice.  It is just so sad.  I bawl whenever Maryann tell her mother how she used to smell her shirt.  Kills me!
