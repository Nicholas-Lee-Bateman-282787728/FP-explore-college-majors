998898,5,6305225818,"I've been a King Crimson fan ever since a Maryland AM radio station first played ""I Talk to The Wind"" in, um, was it 1969?  Took their screaming-face album in to my high school 'Basic Musicianship' class the  following week and thoroughly confounded the excellent instructor who  couldn't make up his mind who was leading the band -- the drummer or the  flautist.  I was also lucky enough to see the Thrak tour at Berkeley's  Greek Theatre, which I rate as the best concert performance I've ever seen,  opening with a perfect Bruford/Mastelotto Taiko duet.
It's hard for any  reproduction to match a live performance like that, but this DVD comes very  close.  Alas, the Taiko piece is not included.  But what a performance!  What excellent production sound and video!  Not quite as much Fripp as I'd  like to see.  But it's great to see, up close, what a fine guitarist Belew is.  And  watching Bruford pick his unthinkable rimshots in his DVD-angle in  ""Indiscipline"" is a spellbinding study on its own.
Excellent  performances by all.
If you like King Crimson's recent incarnations, this  is an absolute must-own.",930960000,32,1116,4.835106382978723
999116,5,6305225818,"I'm glad Fripp found a kindred spirit in Adrien Belew, just as he had with Bruford in the 70's. The band seems energized, happy and I think I even saw Fripp smile a couple of times. Unbelievable!
I recently saw Adrien Belew in a small club in Jacksonville, FL. (Freebird Caf&eacute;) with only about 75 - 100 other folks in the crowd. It was a three piece band brother (age 21) and sister (19) on drums and bass respectively. They were pulling off Crimson material as well as Belew's solo stuff.

Belew played with the verve as if he were in a coliseum with 50,000 screaming fans.
During the set the bassist broke a string and while she changed it, Belew went into a solo version of ""Within You Without You"" that was mind-blowing. He is definitely an asset to the KC lineage.",1342051200,,775,4.419580419580419
999117,3,6305225818,"Like the title says this is the worst King Crimson dvd that is commercialy available.  The picture quality is bad.  Like one other reviewer wrote you can seem a beam of colored light around the members of the band which I don't know if that was done on purpose to add to the effect but it's very annoying.  It seems as at times if you were looking at a neon light.  Espescialy the scenes with Adrian Belew and his guitar where he is a glowing blue and the guitar is a glowing hot pink.  The sound is not that great either.  There are 6 great musicians playing on stage and you can't hear all the players.  On side 2 of the dvd when they go into Elephant Talk Trey Gunn starts off by playing an unaccompanied solo on the Warr guitar and you can't hear him at all then Tony Levin comes in with his chapman stick and you hear Tony fine.  Two drummers and the drums themselves are barely audible.  The drums sound like they are way back in the mix.  The concert doesen't play all the way through.  After each song is done the picture fades to black and the audio fades out.  What's the point of that.  I'd rather just see the full length show all the way through like some of my other Crimson dvds.  The DVD is souble sided.  What the heck for?  Why do we need this on a double sided disc.  Was the show that long they couldn't fit it all on one side?  When you put the dvd in it starts and when they play the last song on the dvd it starts over automaticaly from the beginning.  In order to go to the special features you have to hit the title button on your remote otherwise you can't find them.  Like the special create your own version of King Crimson doing the song 21st Century Schizoid Man where you pick whatever singer, rhythem section and soloist you want.  That I thought was a nice touch.  However performance wise the band is really on and deliver a great show.  That is why I give this dvd 3 stars.  i can't give it anymore or any less.  If your a big Crimhead like me that has to own it all then definetly get this.  If you are just a casual fan or just curious about the group avoid this one and get the Neal And Jack And Me dvd instead.  In my opinion that's the best commercial dvd on the market right now and features two concerts.  One show in France 1982 on the Beat tour.  And one show in Japan on the Three Of A Perfect Pair tour.  I have rarely watched this dvd but is essential to the collection since as I said I'm a hardcore Crimhead that has to have it all (including bootlegs).  If you really want to add this to your collection make this the last dvd you get from them.  Buy Neal And Jack And Me and Eyes Wide Open first.",1224288000,,2647,4.089494163424124
999118,4,6305225818,"If you like King Crimson, you'll like the video.  There are two aspects - the band's performance and the video production.  The performance is unmistakably Crimson.  They're tight and loose at the same time, and seemingly all having a blast except for the stoick Fripp, who's probably having fun in his own universe.  Great drumming and playing by all the members, as expected.  I thoroughly enjoyed the show.

  I was a little disappointed that the format, one in which you can isolate the camera on a single player, was limited to only a few songs.  The menus and other selections could have been a little easier to navigate through; it takes awhile to actually view and track down everything that's on the disk, but it's a fun challenge if you have nothing else to do.  And the ""extras"" are all relatively interesting, though I doubt there are many who will read Fripp's pretentious observations on the music business and about some of his legal wrangelings.  At any rate, buy it, especially if you've never seen them live.",1168300800,,1026,4.740112994350283
999119,5,6305225818,"Video quality's not great, and the menu setup is a pain to navigate, but to be able to see a band of this quality, I can cope. They rarely tour, so these recordings are pretty much all we have. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1154649600,,222,3.9555555555555557
999120,4,6305225818,"This was the first King Crimson DVD I have purchased, an I am seriously considering buying more.

It was very exciting to see the group live, especially this being the Double Trio, which I believe is the best line-up out of KC's on-again off-again revolving door history.

Robert Fripp is probably one of THE eccentric figures in rock. I can't think of another musician that would go out of his way to shun the spotlight ONSTAGE. He sits upstage between the drummers, shrouded in darkness with occasional glimpses of his deceptively complex shredding.

Adrian Belew is a great showman and a guitar WIZARD. Keep an eye out on ""Thrak"" for a ""bit"" of fun!

Tony Levin is just awe-inspiring. Bass, Stick, bowed upright bass, etc. Nice pipes, too. Just an all-around solid player.

Trey Gunn keeps modest but deadly. Wears a good shirt.

Bill Bruford is yellow as all get-out, and his playing can be a little ""hey-look-at-me"" at times, but he's still one of the best boppers about.

Pat Mastelotto keeps a good backbeat and has little to do sometimes besides shake a maraca or strike a drumhead. He seems to be having the most fun, besides Adrian.

The DVD itself is curious. The menu can be a little annoying, and the graphics are atrocious. Still, Fripp's essays are engaging, as are Tony's home-movies. Sound is excellent.

I recommend to even KC newcomers.",1126396800,5,1355,4.756410256410256
999121,1,6305225818,"First, the menuing and navigation system is the stupidest and most counterproductive I have seen on a DVD.  Normally if I don't like the menus I just use chapter / track search, but that is disabled when playing this DVD.

I don't understand why they bothered to include a DTS track unless it was so they could put a ""DTS"" sticker on the label and fool everyone into thinking this is a well-mastered DVD.  It is not. Also the ""Audio"" track selection is disabled, so you have to search around the menus to eventually find ""vector control"" to set the audio.

Video quality is very bad.  Lighting was apparently a problem, camera lenses were dirty and there was excessive glare.",1111104000,8,675,4.591666666666667
999122,5,6305225818,"As a longtime King Crimson fan, I can say that any person who is into finely crafted experimental pop music should just up and buy this disc.  I have owned it for over two years and it still raises my eyebrows.
Strangers who I have exposed to King Crimson by Deja VROOOM walk away bewildered that any group of human beings could conceive of, much less execute, music of this intensity, emotion, and intelligence.
As far as the production goes, you feel as included as you home entertainment system will allow.  I saw the band on this tour, and this is possibly even better than seeing them in the venue I saw them in.  It is as intimate as a recording can be, and a great representation of what this incarnation of the band was doing at the time.
Incidentally, the ""multiple angle"" function that allows you to choose whick KCrimsoner you want to watch and listen to on certain tracks is extremely attractive to those of us that are always trying to unravel the complexity of King Crimson's music is an invaluable tool to that end.  I wish all music DVD's had the forethought to include this function.
Get it.  Right now.",1055203200,23,1120,4.497536945812808
999123,3,6305225818,"I consider king Crimson to be one of the best if not the best progressive bands. Personally I preferred earlier incarnations of the group. However I just couldn't wait to buy this DVD just to see these guys perform. The only member who seemed to enjoy himself was Levin. All the rest of the group just stood there like zombies especially Fripp. Granted, they are excellent musicians but I for one would not pay to see these guys live if that is how they perform. There was no life or soul in there performance. On the same day that I bought this DVD I bought Bjork's ""Live in Cambridge"". It just totally blew me away.",1045094400,6,617,4.373913043478261
999124,5,6305225818,"I must admit, I am an old school KC fan. I have only recently started listening to their later stuff. I am blown away. This band gets better and better as the years go by. This DVD is awesome. I put it on expecting a good concert and a good DVD, This thing is so good. I love the feature where you can focus on 1 person while the song is playing. This band is so tight. The menus leave a little to be desired, but who cares this is a great DVD with some great music. Do yourself a favor, buy this DVD, and play it loud. I must admit I listened to most of it with my mouth open.",1044921600,6,577,3.7768595041322315
999125,5,6305225818,"This D.V.D released by the omnipresent Robert Fripp, leader of those pioneers of Progressive Rock (in this case perhaps a more apt title would be Adventurous Rock) King Crimson have at last brought out a recording that does justice to the bands musical ability and visual presence.
From a musical point of view you get over two and a half hours of Crimson music from the amazing Double Trio King Crimson, a title made up as ever by Fripp where, although all six members were on stage at the same time, they were able to break off in mid-song to play as two separate units, and then all come crashing back together with the power of Thors double sided hammer.
This is used to dramatic effect on such old Crimson standards such as Larks Tongue In Aspic Part II from 1973, (come on if you haven't heard it, aren't you just a little bit curious to find out what a song sounds like with a title like that?), originally recorded when only Robert Fripp & Bill Bruford were in the band. From this line up the others in that period being Jamie Muir on percussion, David Cross on violin, flute & keyboards, plus the mega-talented John Wetton on bass & vocals, but when this 1998 version of the band come in altogether on that most famous of Crimson riffs, the wallpapers shreds from its glue. Most of the well-known songs in the life and times of King Crimson from 1973 onwards are here, with a definitive version of most songs laid down.
Visually the band line up as a back row and a front row. In the back row the two drummers sit on either side of the stage as if castles on a chess board, Bill Bruford in a dapper yellow double breasted suit, whilst Pat Mastelotto effects traditional Rock n Roll garb in jeans and T-Shirt. Sitting on his stool in the middle, dressed in Black is Mr. Robert Fripp, no emotion showing but firmly in command of his guitar and those all around him. The front line consists of the mercurial Trey Gunn on stick guitar, on your left, to the right is without doubt the best bass guitarist in the world of rock, Mr. Tony Levin. And slap bang in the middle is Adrian Belew, the bands lyricist for more than twenty years, lead guitarist, and focal point of the live show, with his pleasant bouncy personality. The fact that he resembles Rick Bryant more and more as time passes is neither here nor there.
This version of King Crimson is a joy to behold. These days Bill Bruford and Trey Gunn have gone on to pastures new, but the nucleus of the band are still going and are in fine form as last years offering The ConstrucKtion Of Light showed (Robert Fripp always chucks on extra capital K into the title if he can).
But the joy of this D.V.D does not stop with the concert alone.
There are so many extras with this set it is hard to know where to start. Firstly there are seven different camera angles on which you can view this concert, zooming in on just one player, or taking an overall view. After watching the concert you can switch over and watch Tony Levins road movies from this tour including clips of travel, hassles, rehearsals, and even some very honest warts n all arguments between band members. A section on the history of King Crimson called In The Court Of The Crimson Kings which chronicles the life and times of King Crimson and all its different line-ups, with plenty of photographs to match. Great fun is the 21st Century Schizoid band where, with an interactive menu, you can select a choice of singers, soloists, and rhythm sections from 1969, 1971, 1974 or 1996 to perform one of King Crimsons most famous songs.
There are also some surprise items slipped into the proceedings, but then if I told you about them, they wouldnt be a surprise would they. Also included are many extra D.V.D Rom features if you want to slip the discs into your computer and become a complete King Crimson Anorak.
So whether you're a fan of King Crimson or not, but you own a D.V.D player and want to use it to its maximum effect, then this is the disc for you.
Well done Mr. Fripp and cohorts, leading the field in innovation, as always.
If you prefer to just get yourself an audio document of this fantastic King Crimson line-up, they also released a double C.D version of a concert from this tour with a near identical set list called BBoom The Official Bootleg, and well worth seeking out.

999241,5,6305225818,"I love King Crimson, and any oppurtunity to see them performing live (they haven't been to Oklahoma in 30 years!!) is something I won't turn down.
  Where to start? The concert is from a performance in Japan during the 'Thrak' tour of 1995-1996, and is one of their best live performances that have been commercially released. The concert previously appeared on video as ""King Crimson: Live in Japan"", but trust me, even if you do have that video, or if you don't even have a DVD player....get a DVD player for crying out loud! It's 2003....get with the times!(..)
  The band members performances are really the key ingredient here. The ability to change angles and put the individual instruments prevalent in the mix during 3 of the songs is great, and well worth it for those interested in how the group achieves its sound. Trey Gunn, who plays a two-handed 'Warr' guitar, is a treat to watch perform, as he approaches the tunes in such a practical and inventive fashion. He was primarily covering the bass parts at the time, but I just really enjoy watching the two handed approach. The band altogether is not really very showy, and focuses mostly on playing the music, although Tony Levin does have commanding stage presence at times!
  I've only mentioned the bass players....Adrian Belew, the lead singer/guitarist is on key the entire show, and watching him during his wilder guitar solos is something that shouldn't be missed. Robert Fripp, the groups leader and self-proclaimed 'Venal Leader', sits in the shadows most of the show, barely flinching or moving a muscle, with the exception of his fingers, which move rather fast and furiously at some points. He is an incredibly disciplined performer (heck, he even named his own record label and an album of 1981 'discipline), and is wonderful as a leader/guiding force in the group.
  NOW the drummers. Bill Bruford is much more restrained and relaxed here than in concerts during the group's 70s-80s concerts. He is of course a fantastic musician, and is most visually entertaining during his percussion breaks and his exciting drum solo during the first moments of 'Indiscipline'. Pat Mastelloto is primarily a percussionist and provides support and various tasks during this period in the groups career (he is, of course, the band's drummer now, and plays a much wider variety of percussion instruments, electronic and otherwise). He stays on the beat, with the exception of a funny goof during the bands first tune of the show.
  This was of course, a 'double trio' (two players covering the parts of guitar, bass, and drums)....I can't say much more about the band, really, just wanted to cover the basics.
  I would like to comment on the extras. There are a ton of them! The disc itself is double-sided, and in order to access the entire concert and all of the extras, you have to stand up and change the disc out. That may be a problem for some of the more lazy people (including me), but it's no big deal. There are a ton of sound options, writings about the band, video shot by Tony Levin off-stage and during rehearsals....some of the footage is fun, others are incredibly dull (the band, with exception of Bob Fripp, playing at an arcade?), and much of the footage has no speech, but is colored by music from the 'discipline global mobile' catalog. There is also an interesting, but rather clumsy feature where you can mix and match performances and individual parts from the tune ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" recorded live over the years. It's pretty fun, but the novelty runs out pretty quick....pictures of the group through its history appear in rhythm to the music, as well....
  Did I miss anything else? It's a disc that is packed with features, but the music is the thing, and it has plenty of it. There have been some rumours, just TALK of a re-issue of this DVD happening sometime later in the year or next year, but I can't possibly imagine there being much more that can add to the quality and quantity of the disc.
  I conclude that the band is on top of their game, and you shouldn't miss it, because if you've happened to wander to this review, i'd imagine that you have at least a small interest in this band....just trust me that it's worth it!",1042329600,31,4231,4.728260869565218
999242,5,6305225818,"This DVD features the Thrak era King Crimson double trio. The musicians on lineup #5 of KC are Robert Fripp: guitars, guitar synth, Frippertronics, Adrian Belew: guitar, guitar synth, sustainer guitar, vocals, Tony Levin: bass, stick, upright electric bass, Trey Gunn: touch guitar (a point of notice, the instrument has something like 10 - 12 stings and covers bass to guitar in range), Bill Bruford: drums, electronic drums and Pat Mastelotto: drums, percussion.
I mention the instrumentation because, as you noticed, there's quite a bit of it. One of the nicest things about this double sided concert is the selection of material which ranges from aggressive to almost light in nature.
This isn't your parent's King Crimson. These guys are all veterans of progressive, jazz and pop which is what you can expect on this DVD.
The recording quality is excellent. There are a lot of fast jumps and occassional poorly edited video sections on song transitions (something like Belew playing alone, switching from synth guitar to guitar as the band comes in only to switch to Trey Gunn who is literally not playing) but beyond a few little glitches the videography is good as well.
Be aware the concert footage is not contigious, that is, each song is titled and fades with one or two exceptions. This isn't a problem for me but may be for others. The good news, no goofy special effects or dumb camera angles. The performances are captured as is, there's even a few mistakes.
The previous reviewer didn't know what to call this music. Very simply it is formally considered Progressive Rock although there are metal and jazz elements. Keep in mind King Crimson started Progressive Rock and is one of the few bands to have actually redefined their music and sound over the 30+ years the band has been around.
This disc is not as heavy on the improvisation as many King Crimson CDs have been of late. What you get is probably the widest range of musical intensity you are likely to find. Keep in mind that in the prog tradition songs are extended at times and there is a good bit of improvisation within structured songs. I am mentioning the purely improvisational material which is not featured in this performance.
The extra features are all interesting and the Frippertronics bonus is also fun to watch. Fripp sits on his stool spinning around to various devices as he records bits and pieces of guitar timbres that he processes and occasionally solos to. For those that thought this style of music was not valid pay attention, you'll see Fripp creating music right before your eyes. It's also important to realize that Fripp was one of the first guitarists in rock to experiment with guitar and effects as a complete form of music.
Favorite performances, Frame By Frame, Red, VROOM, THRAK, One Time and Lark's Tongue in Aspic II. There's 13 more tracks not counting the Frippertronics tune so you are getting extrodinary bang for the buck. Since it is a 2 sided DVD it is like getting a double DVD set.
Most of the material is from the Thrak and Discipline era (80's to mid 90's) with a sprinkling of mid 70's songs. If you haven't heard King Crimson since the first album this will surprise you although thematically the music is still in the same dark vein quite frequently. Adrian Belew brings pop sensibilities to the group which balance the more ferocious instrumental attack. If you liked the mid 70's and later King Crimson this DVD is a must have.
Watch for their new CD, The Power To Believe. Based on their last two mini albums this CD will redefine Progressive Metal and showcase their more Ambient side.",1040342400,19,3613,4.773162939297125
999243,5,6305225818,"I would find it hard to classify this music. If you're familiar with King Crimson than you already have and idea. If you aren't, it's like jazz fusion or at times even free jazz meets acid rock. I guess it's what you would call art rock. It's mostly instrumental and really good. It's Fripp on guitar w/ another guitarist who also sings, two drummers, a guy playing what looks to be some kind of bass/guitar hybrid (hard to name the instrument b/c these things are almost always custom made), and somebody on electric and electric upright bass and what looks to be an electric sitar. So you can get an idea just from the instrumentation that they're going to have an interesting sound. I'd like to look up the instrumentation exactly but whoever designed the menu had their ...so you actually have to read the directions that come with the DVD to navigate through it. If anybody knows, pleas post this info. Fripp doesn't solo much (in fact he pretty much sits in the dark at the back of the stage out of sight to everybody but those watching the DVD close up the whole time) but it's still really good.

The special features are gems. A ""Vector Control"" allows you to choose a particular performer to favor while watching the concert - that is, whenever a shot of him is available, that's what you'll see. This is a great feature for musicians who want to focus attention on their own instrument as it's played by a master.
The ""21st Century Schizoid BAND"" feature allows you to mix & match performers from different KC lineups.  This isn't seamless, but it's really fun to play with.

Being a Crimson fan and knowing that they had released the first concert film exclusively conceived as a DVD my choice of a first purchase was simple. This performance by the double trio line-up blew my mind almost the same way the 80's video release The Noise-Live In Frejus had years before. With a six piece Crimson it was difficult to know ""who was playing what"" without actually seeing them do it,making this a revelation as a viewing experience for the Crimhead who missed seeing them live. The extra are OK; it's fun piecing together different players from various eras doing ""Schizoid Man"",but the show is the real meat.",1028073600,2,836,4.732876712328767

This is a well-documented band on CD (Vroom Vroom, for example), but the DVD adds a depth to the music for those of who never had the live experience.
This was a very good, beastly and interesting band of world-class players that never quite fulfilled its potential, and we're not going to see this Crim lineup again (drummer Bruford and bassist Levin are unlikely to return).  Here we have very strong versions of some of the older Crim material like ""Red"" and ""LTIA II,"" Adrian Belew's Beatlesque ballads, and newer stuff like Thrak, which features a freely improvised section sandwiched by some very heavy and precise riffing.  No other band around can go from etheral to raging to poignant to scary with such grace and ease.

999375,5,6305225818,"First of all, the down sides: 1. The video on this DVD is the absolute worst I've ever seen on DVD.  I've got hundreds of discs, and I've watched even more than that.  This video is not even a good excuse for VHS.  I mean it's *THAT* bad.  Terrible.  Unwatchable.  Fuzzy, sometimes too dim, sometimes too bright.  Most of the camera angles aren't that good.  Some of the camera angles (especially those from behind/above the drummers) look like they were shot with bad...web cams.  Absolutely terrible.  Horrible.  I can't say it enough.
2. The menu...This menu is truly an example of what NOT to do when designing any sort of human interface system.  I honestly believe that I could not design a worse interface if I tried.  I owned this disc for weeks before I figured it out.  Sometimes ""up"" means ""down,"" sometimes ""left"" means ""down and right"" etc.  To make matters worse, the only menu option you are shown is the one you have selected.  And *still* worse is what they call those selections.  Want audio settings?  Oh that's ""Vector Patrol.""  Want to select DTS surround?  Oh, click on ""Sector Normal.""
I mean, who comes up with this stuff?  I can't even comprehend.
Why did I give it 5 stars then?  Because I didn't buy this disc for the video or for the menus.  I bought it for the sound of the music.  Amazing.  Six virtuosos just going at it.  Rhythms and harmonies intermingling perfectly, with a whole lot of screwed up noise sounds thrown in every now and then.  Nearly every song on here is amazing.
The recording quality is great too.  The 5.1 DTS mix is just the way the boys in the band want the music to be presented, and it's wonderful.  My front left and surround left speakers become a stereo pair, and the left drum kit is set in the standard stereo configuration across those two channels.  Same for the other kit on the other side.  The music surrounds you, with a different musician assaulting you from each direction.
The music is why I bought this disc, so in spite of it's terrible video quality and nearly unuseable interface, I recommend it without hesitation.
Figure out the menu well enough to get yourself into DTS mode, then turn the...TV off and enjoy!",997401600,7,2187,4.559278350515464
999376,3,6305225818,"Well Folks, the Crimheads everywhere have been gushing over this DVD... I'm a fan from 'way back, too, and bought it full of anticipation.
Unfortunately, The new Crimson is so virtuosic that the performances are even more ""by the book"" than usual, which lends a creative lifelessness to this DVD, despite the generally excellent material.
Yes, all the camera angles and such are fun to play with once or twice, but whoever picked them must not be a musician... it's hard to see what anyone is actually playing.  Also, only a couple of songs have this capability, not the whole disk.
The sound is typical of late '90s Crimson: hard edged and lacking the oceanic subtle tonal distinctions of earlier incarnations.
If you appreciate all of King Crimson, but really are focused on the spirituality of the performances on the Great Deceiver ('73 tour), which I quite obviously am, then you will be intrigued by this disk, but won't return to it very often.
Hey Mr. Fripp... sir, are you listening? Let's have the Great Deceiver on DVD... please?  Surely there is footage from that era?",989798400,4,1080,4.801075268817204
999377,5,6305225818,"This DVD should be a benchmark for other bands to attempt to match: not only is it a concert, it's a virtual smorgasbord of after-hours fun for any Crimson fan.  In places one can choose to select a camera angle by which to watch one band member alone (although, to be sure, Robert Fripp will never go down in history as the world's most animated stage performer).  The song selection is excellent although I wish they had performed more of the older stuff.  The interactive game allowing one to select which combinations of lineup to perform ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" is good fun as well...perhaps someday Deep Purple will produce a DVD allowing one to select which five people to perform ""Smoke on the Water.""
If there are any drawbacks to the disc, I did not like the menu; it took a while to figure out how to ""go with the flow"" and capture which selection I wanted.  Also, it's a shame that it has to be two-sided (half of the show is on one side and half on the other; they should have just had the first side be the show and the second side be nothing but extras, if at all possible).  Also, the back of the box alludes to ""hidden extras.""  How does one find these goodies?

999378,4,6305225818,"I'm a fan of the post-70's King Crimson, so will admit to some bias. Even so, I highly recommend this DVD. The sound is excellent, and the features such as ""21st Century Schizoid Band,"" where you can mix and match  performers from the various incarnations of the band into different  versions of the song really take advantage of the DVD media. It's also nice  to be able to see the musicians enjoying their work. The only downside is  that at times the video is fuzzy and overexposed, at other times needlessy  dark.  A bit of that for atmosphere would be OK, but if it's intentional I  think it's overused. All in all, though, a tremendous amount of material  for the money and a great addition to any fan's library.",962928000,4,718,4.511627906976744

As Laurie Anderson would say, ""Sit bolt upright in your straight-backed chair and prepare for  difficult listening."" This is probably superfluous, but I think they  are great artists.
Technically, the DVD production is very very good.  The 5.1 channel mix is certainly not accurate if you are looking for  concert reproduction, but neither is it gimicky or over-produced. This is a  fantastic demonstration of 5 channel audio. Stunning!
The content of this  DVD is artistically masterful (assuming you buy into Robert Fripp's et. al.  vision.) To all King Crimson fans out there (especially if you like the  last 10 years or so) YOU WANT THIS DVD.",952646400,7,771,4.96875

7886315,5,6305225818,"Now, I don't feel totally up to writing a detailed review right now.  But, for this DVD I must.

For what it's worth, this is my favorite concert DVD of all time, my favorite live recording of all time, and a high contender for top 10 albums of all time, even when placed against every other album in King Crimson's (my favorite band, tied with one other) catalog, and against every album in the full discographies of Pink Floyd, Yes, Hendrix, The Dead, Dylan, Miles Davis, Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders, Tool, Modest Mouse, Simon and Garfunkel, Buckethead, Magma, Frank Zappa, etc, all musicians that I personally believe crossed an immaculate threshold in their artistry in one way or another.  I dove deep into the discogs of all of these bands to the point of knowing them inside and out and like the back of my hand, with some blindspots for Buckethead, Miles, Coltrane and Zappa because of their monolithic amount of releases.  That's probably a couple hundred, maybe more albums by what I consider to be the best bands of all time.  And this LIVE CONCERT DVD still sits very close to the top ranks.  So I hope that says something about my love for this performance...

Personally, the '81 lineup of Crimson and it's variations (more stable than previously, with Bruford, Levin, and Belew [almost?] always being there)  over the next 3+ decades is my absolute favorite incarnation of Crimson, and thus quite possibly my favorite band of all time.  The addition of Gunn and Mastelotto who, with Fripp and the three aforementioned, formed the Double Trio... anything I say that attempts to describe this greatness with words is elephant talk.  The Double Trio was one of the best things to happen to progressive.  If you treat with equal measure the technical and creative aspects of musicianship, I am tempted to describe the DT as the best display of musicianship of the 20th century, and perhaps one of the best displays since the earliest recorded days of music.  Consider that, then consider that this is their absolute BEST effort.

I'm artistic and have really put my time in with listening to music and I write and play music as well... anyway, I can't prove my credibility, especially because I have a difficult time describing what I love about music, especially with a band as complex, technical, and absolutely inimitable as KC.  Just, from someone who loves music deeply and has for a long time, take it from me:  I VERY STRONGLY recommend this show to everyone.  While there's definitely something about Deja Vroom that affects me personally and it may not have the same effect on all of you, if even one of you has an experience watching this that parallels my own experiences with Deja Vroom, I will feel forever satisfied.

There's just something immaculate about this entire performance.  Please indulge yourself in it until you love it as much as I do.  Please.  It would make me so happy.  :D",1483401600,,2912,4.760956175298805
7886316,4,6305225818,"Not sure if this is an older version of the dvd or if it was even ever reissued, but the dvd itself is full of strange technical problems, and the multi-angle  feature does not work in any form....Thankfully it's a great show and KC stuff isn't readily available so I guess this is the trade-off for owning this dvd.",1481241600,,316,4.3559322033898304

7886321,4,6305225818,"Like the last reviewer, I've had this DVD on my shelf for a while without really watching it over the last few years.  I remember not really being blown away by it so much the first time.  With all the recent revival of KC through a series of reissues (5.1 surround mixes, multiple disc box sets like ""The Road To Red"" and ""40th Anniversary of Larks Tongues in Aspic"", etc.) I have simply become enamored by this incredible band. It's funny as I once thought ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" was their only good song (boy was I ever wrong about that!).  Anyway, getting back to this DVD...it's not my personal favorite lineup of KC (for me, that has to go to either the Greg Lake or John Wetton versions) but, with Fripp, Bruford and Levin in the band, how can you go wrong?  Not as much a fan of Belew in KC...I think he takes them too far away from their roots.  That said, he must be credited for bringing/leading them into a new era.  All together, a simply stellar performance. I haven't yet spent any time to play around with all the features of the DVD.  I am somewhat interested in Fripp's commentaries so I am sure at some point I will check them out.  I would have given this 5-stars if the video quality were better...",1385078400,,1224,4.337719298245614
7886322,4,6305225818,"During the infancy of DVDs, I remember reading about how the rock group King Crimson had done some interesting tricks with the new medium.  While I was never a big fan of the group, I liked them enough to see what they had done.  Frankly, I watched it once and put it away some 14 years ago not particularly impressed I guess.

Wondering why, I watched it again.  And yes I appreciate it more now, but not necessarily because of the tricks, but because of their music.  KC began in the late 60's as a blend of some jazz improv mixed with some rock; some soft, some hard.  Layered on top is a blend of electronica and fusion.  What we have here is a double sided DVD with a choice of DTS 5.1 surround or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround both are fine given their lossy limitations.

The group also makes liberal use of multiple camera angles, interesting for the time but hardly ever used later in the life of the DVD.  When the viewer chooses a different artist to focus on, the audio follows.  There is also an interesting feature that allows the user to ""mix"" various rhythm sections of the band in different eras!  Hard to explain, but the guys were experimenting.  There are also a variety of commentaries, mostly featuring the band's independent leader Robert Fripp.

What is on display is a concert recorded at the Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo on October 5-6, 1995.  The video is terrible, yes terrible.  Shot in a low light situation, augmented by blue and yellow halos surrounding the 6 piece band (Fripp always in the dark).  Also look for a 4.3:1 aspect ratio.

The positives (these overwhelm the negatives by a long shot): It's King Crimson, it's the double trio, it's amazing music, amazing musicians, but what really makes this DVD stand out is the ""vector patrol"" feature which highlights the band member of your choice, shows him on the screen whenever there's an available shot (on some songs it's a lot) and his instrument in the center channel.
