I have several of the year specific Duke films and they just mention the outcome of the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, as the video moves on to the Canadian GP. I guess the English makers of these videos didn't consider the USGP to be important enough.",1439510400,,300,4.101694915254237
8033476,3,B0002W1AZA,"Excellent color footage of the cars and pilots of the era,but sadly very little in the way of race action,usually just the start and finish of most races. Focused mostly on the Lotus Team, Andretti,Peterson and Colin Chapman.",1439078400,,225,4.947368421052632

I love Formula One. Sadly today's version of it is a far cry from the truly great eras and drivers that graced the sport throughout the years. Through the cleanly painted rear engined racing cigars of the 1960s, through the wingy ""pack of cigarettes"" monsters of the 1970s, and through the super-fat 1,000 HP turbo beasts of the 1980s the sport always seemed to know no bounds as cars got faster and faster and things more out of control in terms of cost going forward into the future. That is why those who love this sport and its history do so. The sheer madness of it all coupled with the competition spanning the globe vying for the title of Driver's Championship as country against country fight to produce the greatest chassis, the greatest engine, and the greatest driver all culminating in the epic soap opera of testosterone and oil. Sadly we are not all in the same boat when it comes to fandom of F1 in this country and the scarcity of F1 titles available on DVD is a direct result. So, we must be happy with the few options thrown our way and that is why I give 5 stars to this series of short 50 minute films covering the F1 seasons from 1970-1980. The picture quality is great as is the rare ability to see these classic cars we cherish at different angles. Quite a treat for F1 nuts. I've rewatched each film several times and they NEVER get old.",1379030400,,1475,4.442804428044281
