8420617,5,B004AP3PTE,"I lived on the island of Oahu from 1975-to-1982. I have watched the Brothers Cazimero perform many,many times.
I was a Brothers Cazimero groupie of sorts! They helped start the Hawaiian Music renaissance of the early 70's that brought
the music and culture back to the mainstream. There is no one finer,and Roberts haunting voice will give me chicken skin all these years later when listening. They are indeed a National Treasure!",1385337600,,430,4.986111111111111
