8627122,5,B00GST8JRS,"What a value - this set is comprised of 4 different dvd's, and the first one alone has 3 workouts on it!  The dvds feature 2 different instructors.  I found all the workouts to be energetic and challenging, with options to make them harder or easier.  (Actually, you can always add weights to make a routine more challenging.) This dvd set is a very good addition to my home workout collection.  And, with the price of a used set being so cheap here on Amazon, you can't go wrong.  I have a huge collection of workout dvds, including many for walking.  This dvd set is a nice change of pace and I'm happy with the quality of the workouts, and my purchase.  Highly recommended!",1462060800,2,676,4.403225806451613
