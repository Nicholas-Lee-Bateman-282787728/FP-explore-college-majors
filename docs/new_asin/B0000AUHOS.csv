7997848,4,B0000AUHOS,"The 1998 animated feature of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, dubbed from a 1993 Spanish original, was itself derived from a 13 part mini-series.  The central character became Willy Fogg, who originally appeared in the animated Spanish series of 26 thirty minute episodes entitled LA VUELTA AL MUNDO DE WILLY FOGG / AROUND THE WORLD WITH WILLY FOGG  (1981) (and would later appear in a similarly altered version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas).  The imperturbable British adventurer, Fogg is drawn as a lion, in a context for children in which each of the main characters appears as an animal appropriate to their nature.  This version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH commences at the Reform Club, where Fogg had begun his trip Around the World in Eighty Days.  He is now introduced to Professor Otto Lidenbrock, of Hamburg, and learns of the old, coded parchment written by Arne Saknussemm, hidden before his arrest for claiming that he had traveled to the center of the Earth.  Fogg realizes the writing is simply backwards, and decides he must follow its directions.  Fellow clubman Sullivan bets Fogg 20,000 that he cannot accomplish the trip in 70 days, and bring back proof, a dare that Fogg accepts.

 Shortly after Fogg, his servant Rigadon, and Lidenbrock depart, they realize (in a scene reminiscent of WHERE TIME BEGAN) the need for the practical help of Fogg's wife, the Princess Romy (replacing Aouda from Around the World in 80 Days).  She and her humorous servant Tico join the expedition, with Hans added as guide when they reach Iceland.  In another echo of Around the World in Eighty Days, Sullivan hires the villainous Transfer to ensure that Fogg fails.

 The traditional episodes are dramatized:  becoming separated and lost, the underground sea, crossing on a raft, and encountering sea monsters.  There is direct borrowing from WHERE TIME BEGAN in a forest of apparently fossilized turtle shells which turn out to be not only alive but carniverous.  Exploding the passage that leads to the surface creates a tidal wave that carries the raft upward, and to make the episode plausible, Lidenbrock explains that the water is evaporating from the temperature of the molten lava underneath.  Carrying Saknussemm's diary, found underground, Fogg rushes to show it to the mayor of the village and win the bet.

 The addition of Fogg (taking the place of Axel) and the concept of a race and wager do little damage to the original narrative, enhancing the element of suspense.  Lidenbrock is a less significant character, but the primary episodes in the novel remain.  The animation style is modest, with minimized movement, but sufficiently elaborate and colorful so as not to be noticeably cheap.  The 74 minute production was produced by B.R.B. International, S.A., and created by Claudio Biern Boyd, with general supervision by Iaki Orive, and a ""literary adaptation"" by Rafael Soler, with the English script by Steve Edwin, John Vernon, and Terry Wilson.",1210896000,,2993,5.004040404040404
