8162644,5,B000LP51R6,"All of the DVD's in this series are superb. I have trained in other internal styles and learned basics of Hsing Yi be4 buying these dvd's. The instruction is clear and the form is top notch. It would be helpful to have even a small amount of experience in Tai Chi or Kung Fu, but even without it you should be able to perform these routines. If you read some of the books on Hsing Yi, then you will have a good understanding of the internal aspects of the art and can become quite powerful. But again, it would be very useful to at least get some personal instruction in Tai Chi or another internal style of Kung Fu at some point, since the principles are the same, that is, if you can not find a Hsing Yi teacher first. Good luck!",1191801600,4,731,4.154929577464789
