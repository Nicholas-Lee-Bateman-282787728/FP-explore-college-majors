7797411,5,1571322442,"Frankenstein (written by Mary Shelly) is a classic story about how Doctor Victor Frankenstein (played by Wishbone) brings a dead man back to life. But after the creature is made he turns out to be a misfit, and goes on a rampage and destroys everything he can get his hands on. David's science fair project isn't a monster but it does go on the loose and David and his friends have to find it before the science fair. Will David find his science fair project and can Frankenstein capture his monster?

What a great episode. At the end you get to see the actor who plays Frankenstein's creature in makeup and out of makeup. (I think they did a pretty good job) This is another great episode that you must watch because if you don't your missing out big time.",1250294400,3,757,4.4071428571428575

7797414,4,1571322442,"I am flipping channels on the television and suddenly I see a Jack Russell Terrier in a laboratory apparently creating the Frankenstein monster.  What I discovered, in another great instance of being way behind the Pop Culture curve, was ""Wishbone,"" a live-action television series about a dog named Wishbone (voiced by Larry Brantley), who each week imagines himself, his human owner Joe Talbot (Jordan Wall) and their friends in Oakdale in the middle of a classic novel.  For ""Frankenbone"" the novel in question is Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein.""  David Barnes (Adam Springfield) is having a little trouble with his science project, and Wishbone see obvious parallel's to the famous gothic novel of a creator and his monster gone amuck.  I was impressed with the ability of the show to whet the novice audience's appetite for actually reading the novel and for playing off the classic book for the rest of us, in the best tradition of ""The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show"" and other cherished ""children's"" programs that are even funnier if you are an adult.  I was also surprised to see that the only Emmys this show has been nominated for (and won) are for costume design!  Certainly more are deserved by a program that has found a unique way of introducing kids to classic literature.  The only reason I think that this particular episode is a slightly lesser effort is because as a general rule I have found ""Wishbone"" does better when the work in question is more ""unknown,"" and with ""Frankenstein"" there is so much baggage out there in Pop Culture to get in the way.",1007683200,4,1564,4.835205992509363
