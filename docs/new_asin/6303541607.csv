7851581,4,6303541607,"My 20 month old little girl loves this DVD. It holds her attention & doesn't have anything that makes me worry about her seeing it.

To me it falls short of the best Sesame Street DVDs for early watchers.  The song writing isn't quite as strong.  Too many have Big Bird as their subject matter.  The audio on 3-4 songs is sub-par -- distorted from the level being too high or poorly mixed for depth.  A surround sound system has to be set to ""music"" instead of ""movie"" or the sound is really flat.  The vocals on the country style Wheels on my Feet sound like city-folk playing ya-hoo country. (the great Wavin' Goodbye To You With My Heart on Sing Yourself Silly shows how well the Sesame Street crew can do this style).  This reads like harsh treatment, but I think the DVD is a notch below the best or even what they could have done with the chosen songs.
