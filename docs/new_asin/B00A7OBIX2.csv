8547958,5,B00A7OBIX2,"Neil Sedaka In Concert is a fantastic one he did in Birmingham, England in 1991. At the top of his game , he does a wonderful job of performing his old and new hits. Favorite tracks are, Oh Carol, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do[both versions], Calender Girl, Solitaire, Standing On The Inside, Love Will Keep Us Together, A Little Lovin"", That's When The Music Takes Me, and Laughter In The Rain. Fans of Neil Sedaka will like this the most.",1472515200,,436,4.395061728395062

8547964,5,B00A7OBIX2,"This DVD is of a concert Neil Sedaka did in England, and while I might have preferred more of his old stuff be done, it is a good mix of old and newer material.  Very enjoyable to watch.  We will be seeing him live on a cruise ship in 2 months, hopefully his show there will be as good as this DVD.",1379289600,3,298,3.7903225806451615
