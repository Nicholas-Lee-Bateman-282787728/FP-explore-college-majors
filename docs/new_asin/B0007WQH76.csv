2246963,5,B0007WQH76,A wonderful warm story about love and loss of a loved one....in this case a loving husband.  This beautiful loving woman struggles to pull her life back together after the loss of her husband and falls for an unstable cad who in the end destroys her.  This beautiful movie will hold you in it's grasp until the very last scene.  Enjoy!,1163030400,11,335,4.459016393442623

2246978,2,B0007WQH76,"First off, I want to start off this review, by saying that I am a HUGE & AVID Danielle Steel fan. I have read (and LOVED) NUMEROUS Danielle Steel books including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/0440173922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jewels/dp/044021422X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jewels</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoya/dp/0440203856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoya</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remembrance/dp/0440173701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remembrance</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossings/dp/044011585X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossings</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Echoes/dp/B0085SD1B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Echoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Good-Woman/dp/0385340265/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Good Woman</a>, ""Safe Harbour"", ""H.R.H."", ""Miracle"", and countless others (too many to name or even remember the titles of, off the top of my head -- though the ones I've listed above are my TOP faves!)

I have also seen (and LOVED) at least 3 Danielle Steel movies --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-s-The-Ring-Parts-1-2/dp/B0007WQHE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel's The Ring: Parts 1 & 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-s-Jewels/dp/B0007LPT0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel's Jewels</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-s-Zoya-Parts-1-2-1995/dp/B000CEXF4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel's Zoya - Parts 1 & 2 (1995)</a>&nbsp;(all three of which I also own on DVD)

With that said, I started watching this film expecting to ABSOLUTELY LOVE it (the way I have LOVED every single Danielle Steel book I have read so far, and the way I have LOVED the 3 Danielle Steel movies that I know for sure that I've seen) since I LOVED the corresponding book.

But by the end of the movie, I was so relieved & glad that I did not actually buy this movie (but rather got it free online), because it was really a BIG let-down!

Because for starters, this movie cut off the ENTIRE first half (or so) of the book. There was nothing in the book about Serena's childhood, or struggles during the war (like how she had to slave & toil as a servant in her own home) or how she met Brad Fullerton

Not only that, but the movie also cut out HUGE CHUNKS from other parts of the book as well, like the extent to which Mrs. Fullerton mistreated Serena, or how hard Serena had to struggle immediately following her Brad's death in the Korean War, or Vanessa's life after her mother's death, first with the drunk Uncle Greg and his cold, aloof and bitterly resentful wife Patty (who had once been Brad's fiancee before Brad met & married Serena) and then later with her loving Uncle Teddy.

If I had to come up with ONE WORD to describe this movie, it would be: RUSHED!

This film just rushes through the superficial basics of the book without going into ANY depth, in order to get to the ""meat"" of the plot/storyline -- compared to other Danielle Steel movies like ""The Ring"" and ""Jewels"" which were longer films, but much much better!!

On the plus side, the casting of Eva LaRue in the role was EXCELLENT!

Not only does she have the exotic looks of an Italian princess, but the accent she used and the way she acted in this film was wonderful -- and I only wish the movie was MUCH longer (why couldn't they do a two-part movie the way they did for ""The Ring"", ""Jewels"" and other epic-length Danielle Steel novels?)

Basically, I LOVED the book ""Remembrance"", but this movie was a HUGE disappointment & let-down, and left a LOT to be desired!! :(",1358121600,3,4014,6.716763005780347

2246982,5,B0007WQH76,I like the movie very much when Serena the Italian Princess has married Major Brad Fullerton carrying their unborn child when arriving to America during World War II and when Teddy Fullerton was always there for them being a good friend to both of them and also helping them with the birth of their daugther Vanessa Theodora Fullerton whom Serena names after Teddy. When Brad dies in the war in Korea she is left aone to raise her daughter and also gets a job as a model with the help of Teddy and with no support from her mother in law who never accepted her grandchild. then she meets Vasili Arbus the unstable Greek photographer also hides a secret from her and they fall in love and get married and spend their honeymoon at the Mediterranean. The sad part he is a drug addict and also unstable Serena is pregnant with his child which she gives birth to his daughter Charlotte Francesca after his and her mother and then Serena is murdered by him after she found out about his secret. Vanessa lives with Greg and Patty which is unhappy with and also never there for her like Teddy was. He was the best person for her. He gets full custody of her because he was always there for her since she was born and has given her lots of her love and he won the case at the final of the film during the ending of the film he and Linda has gotten back together and also got engaged. Vanessa is all grown up and also goes to the Mediterranean to see her half-sister Charlotte to tell her about their mother and the war.,1352332800,,1509,4.298245614035087
