8310652,4,B001IB6324,"The disk contains an hour or so film on a women's temple in Tibet. It is not unlike, Daughters of Dolma. This film shows us many different voices in the community. It certainly shows their lives, but I couldn't help think they are mostly girls seemed to have little understanding of Buddhism, beyond reciting some precepts, which teetered more on superstition. (Perhaps that is in the translation? e.g., ""The abbot says I should do this, so I won't end up an insect in the next life."" It was also interesting to see that many live on their own, cook for themselves, rather than in community. They are certainly building and establishing a community, to some degree, one that seems like it could benefit from a woman master, like Tenzin Palmo or a Pema Chodron: with the male abbots, there seems to still exist some biases. At the least, the film, and the two other documentaries on here as a bonus, really speak to the need and benefit of underprivileged women in Tibet getting educated. Worth watching, and certainly inspires conversation about their way of life.",1489104000,,1064,4.756756756756757

8310656,5,B001IB6324,"This film in my opinion, reflects the nature of Tibetan people, in this case women, better than anything I have viewed. The photography is unfussy, there is minimal intrusion from the director and the nuns themselves are allowed to speak for extended periods about their lives. There are no cliches about Tibet to be found and the sense that I got after repeated viewings was that the a considerable portion of the film's success was due to the fact that it was made by a person who really understands how a story can be told and who does not impose themself on the telling. I saw it screened at a film festival amd the response was rapturous and well deserved. It is delightful and well paced and permits the subjects to emerge as dignified and autonomous rather than as people of merkely ethnographic interest.",1354233600,2,812,4.645833333333333
