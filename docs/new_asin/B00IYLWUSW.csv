8646413,2,B00IYLWUSW,"I love Britney Spears so much. I am a diehard fan...otherwise I would not have bought this DVD set. But curiosity got the best of me. On both of these DVDs, it is mostly people talking about Britney and you really don't get much interviews of Britney herself. But being that it is Unauthorized, it makes sense. This DVD set was made in the U.K. And to be honest it made me angry that the people talking about her were quite negative when they talked about her. She has overcome so much in her life and no one is perfect. If you want a better documentary about her life, I would recommend - ""Britney Spears - Unbreakable."" It is unauthorized as well, but you see more footage of Britney and you get to see more of her talking. The narrator is British. He has a pleasant voice, however their is a girl singing all of her songs in the background that sucks severely. This DVD was made in 2011 and made in Fort Mill, South Carolina and it is 60 mins long. For the money and the quality, I would not recommend buying ""Britney Spears - DVD Collector's Box.""",1442275200,4,1051,4.28643216080402
