8622046,5,B00GBT6332,"I was only able to watch two of the three films in this collection -- An Enemy of the People and The Home and the World -- because I checked them out from the library, and The Stranger is apparently no longer in the library catalog (other reviewers have noted that The Stranger DVD was manufactured with defects, so probably a library patron complained and that is why the DVD is no longer available).  But the reviewer who stated that this collection is worth purchasing just to get these two films is CORRECT.

I am a huge fan of Henrik Ibsen, based on the three plays of his that I have read:  A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, and Ghosts.  I have not read An Enemy of the People yet, but I agree with the other reviewer who stated that Satyajit Ray's movie of that name is ""Ibsen Improved.""  Ibsen's play fits SO PERFECTLY into the real-life Hindu preoccupation with the holiness of the Ganges River, that it's almost like Ibsen wrote his play SIMPLY so a century later Satyajit Ray could reformat it to make this film.  I don't want to be a spoiler, but Ray's interpretation of An Enemy of the People continues to be completely relevant to issues facing the modern world -- India in particular, but other countries as well.  I highly recommend it.

The Home and the World is based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel by the same name, and its story is so provocative, instructive, and important that it makes me want to rush out and read more by and about Rabindranath Tagore: clearly he was a thoughtful genius worth discovering and experiencing further.

Reviewers have criticized both these films as being more like filmed plays instead of movies, and that is somewhat of a valid criticism:  if you are looking for an action film, neither of these movies will appeal to you.  These films are intellectual, moral, and philosophical -- written and filmed for thinking individuals who care about understanding the forces which divide and destroy humanity, so those forces can be unmasked, understood, and avoided or healed or, at least, made as benign as possible.

If you love Satyajit Ray's films you will also love recent films by Persian director Asghar Farhadi, which include The Salesman (2016) (a reworking of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman), About Elly (2015), A Separation (2012), The Past (2014).  Farhadi's provocative plots are full of nuance and suspense, and make you think about 'big issues' for days afterwards, if not longer.",1516060800,,2443,4.747044917257683

8622048,3,B00GBT6332,"THE MOVIE, 'THE STRANGER', PLAYED FINE UNTIL ABOUT 1 HR AND 43 MINUTES, THEN ON TWO SEPARATE MACHINES IN MY HOUSE THE MOVIE STARTED GLITCHING, STICKING, NOT PLAYING. WE SENT THE ORIGINAL SET BACK AND THEY REPLACED THE WHOLE SET. THE OTHER TWO MOVIES IN THE SET HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE PLAYING.  WHEN WE GOT THE NEW REPLACEMENT, WE IMMEDIATELY CHECKED THE PLAYING FOR THE MOVIE, 'THE STRANGER', AGAIN. THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT ABOUT 1 HR 43-43 MINUTES...GLITCHS, SKIPPING STOPPED ON BOTH DVD PLAYERS. THE OTHER MOVIES APPEAR TO PLAY OK. STRANGE COINCIDENCE THAT IN 2 DIFFERENT BOX SETS AT THE SAME TIME ON THE SAME MOVIE THE PLAY PROBLEMS STARTED. I WOULD THINK THAT THERE IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE HERE. THE MOVIES/STORIES ARE WONDERFUL BUT YOU MUST DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE THE SET FOR THE OTHER TWO MOVIES.",1479513600,,829,4.678082191780822
8622049,2,B00GBT6332,"Some of this director's earlier B&W films (Pathar Panchali and Apur Sansar especially) are masterpieces. The characters in those movies feel so natural, alive, nothing is ever said that feels strained. In contrast, in these later films, after you get to know the characters a little bit, their talking starts to feel more and more unnatural. I felt that the natural... sharpness of the characters was often compromised: their reactions were not as swift and spontaneous as you feel it should have naturally happened in the circumstances. The reason seem to be unpolished scripts: when a screenwriter puts his desire on how a certain dialogue should proceed above of what would be the natural reactions of his characters in every moment.

These films are also less of the movies and more of the theatre plays: it's talking-talking-talking, and really too excessive, exhausting and then exasperating talking, with very few brief scenes outside of the house. Also the plasticity itself of the film feels theatrical.

I have watched two thirds of the ""The Stranger"" and of ""The Enemy of the people"". I was initially very interested in the plot of ""The Stranger"" when I read it here on Amazon, but could not force myself to finish either of the movies because the talking was getting more and more unnatural and strained as the movies progressed, so even the interest in the outcome waned completely as I forced myself to continue watching it till I had to finally give up.

No harmony of the earlier movies.",1406851200,4,1503,4.909448818897638
8622050,5,B00GBT6332,"Ray's filmed interpretation of Ibsen's masterpiece is masterful in its own right and worth the cost of this collection in and of itself. And what a relief to see the  brilliant,sharp clear colors, instead of the grainy recopied third generation black and white prints you can find on too many of Ray's other films.",1406160000,3,314,4.814814814814815

8622052,5,B00GBT6332,A must for any admirer of Satyajit Ray's film. A beautiful collection that I would cherish for a long time.,1402358400,4,107,4.4
8622053,5,B00GBT6332,"This review is for one of the three movies contained in this box set of DVDs: Satyajit Ray's 1989 adaptation and update of Ibsen's ""An Enemy of the People."" In Ray's late-career retelling, an Indian town's famous Hindu holy watering hole replace's Ibsen's health spa. Pollution there is endangering people with a sometimes fatal virus and the town doctor wants to warn the citizenry. At first, he is joined in his crusade by well-meaning journalists and intellectuals, but gradually all fall silent as clergy and constabulary trample all resistance. After all, the town's status as a leading pilgrimage center is at stake. With only the support of his wife and children, the good doctor is isolated and demonized and ultimately faces banishment. Ibsen's play drowns in a lot of pointless sermonizing. Ray's movie stays a compelling human drama from beginning to end. This is a highly relevant, powerful movie in an America where polls of certain regions in the throes of epidemic stupidity show the majority of people believe evolution is an atheist plot.",1396310400,9,1055,5.068965517241379
