2240100,1,B0007SL2MK,"S.S.S. stands for Seriously Significantly Stupid!  And THAT'S a moment of truth.  The animation is an absolute failure and the quarter-witted characters are obnoxious and lack ANY depth, sincerity, substance or charisma.  Colorful is colorblind!  It's an agonizing 120 minutes, and I couldn't make it past the first 30!  It's in the trash now where it belongs!  What a waste of time AND money!  I wouldn't give this anime to my worst enemy!  ADV films has somewhat of a tarnished reputation now thanks to this abomination.  The same distributor who gave us such priceless gems like Petite Princess Yucie, Princess Tutu, Legend of Crystania, Zaion, Plastic Little, Battle Angel, The Girl From Phantasia, Devil Hunter Yokho, Elfen Lied and This Ugly Yet Beautiful World (Yes, I own all of these titles.  I just haven't commented on them yet.), has sunk to a new low approving of this unpresedented disaster.  O.K. I think that's enough hate for now.  I just had high hopes for this anime and antisipated its arrival which was today.  I only had an interest in it because the cover looked nice.  Had I known ahead of time what the material consisted of, I NEVER would've wasted 17.99 on it.  It certainly isn't worth THAT much!  Take my advice, fellow anime lovers and pass this one over!  Don't allow your intelligence to be insulted like MINE was!  This is Orbital101 and I approve this message.",1253232000,2,1394,4.810126582278481

2240102,4,B0007SL2MK,"""Colorful"" is a much better anime than it has any right to be.  It doesn't sound like much. 16 short animations about men's fascination with women's underwear, and the joy to be found in a tiny glimpse.  But director Shun Nakahara obviously took his clues from shows like FLCL, mixing and matching animation styles, keeping things moving at a rapid pace, and delivered an innovative, clever and funny DVD.

For all its subject matter, there is very little naughty about ""Colorful"".  This isn't going to get anybody going on a lonely night, and there is no sex or nudity to speak of.  Its all about the little glimpse, the hidden flash of magic that lurks under every girl's skirts, and the lengths guys are willing to go to to sneak a peek.  This is the kind of animation that could have only come out of Japan, where ""panchira"" is a national past time, the kind of thing guys will talk about over too many beers at a late night bar.

This is not just boy's fun either.  My girlfriend, who hates anime on general principal, loved ""Colorful"", and was cracking up during the whole thing.  This may actually be the only anime DVD she has ever watched with me from beginning to end.  Essentially a series of comedy sketches, it delivers lots of jokes machine-gun style, and the constant switching of animation styles keeps it from getting boring.

A word of caution, however.  The English dubbing should be avoided at all cost.  They obviously saw the need to make what is essentially light comedy ""dirtier"". They replaced most of the best jokes with more direct language, and the two scripts have almost nothing to do with each other.  I couldn't make it through the ""Making of..."" fake documentary either, which I found quite painful.",1200960000,8,1732,4.654605263157895
2240103,4,B0007SL2MK,"Though the cover says something totally different Colorful just happens be something other than perverted. It seems that not only is Colorful intended to make its viewers laugh hysterically but also teach guys a lesson about things they think they get away with. The situation is always the same but the scenario keeps changing. There's always a girl in an odd position at a store, swim practice, or even just outside waiting for a cab and she doesn't notice but the unsuspecting guy or guys quickly see.

The guys think they're having a good old time with it until something bad happens. The bad and ugly could be from a nosebleed to getting hit by a car but either way the lesson is always learned and always very funny. I guess you could say that Colorful shows how justice is served for the unsuspecting women all over the world but because colorful's comedy can be immature in a lot of ways people don't actually always see it the way I do. The animation is very nice even when their rough slow image is added to show how these guys feel after getting knocked around. It's a good series that won't get old quick.",1137628800,2,1117,4.502463054187192
2240104,2,B0007SL2MK,"overhwleming and underhwelming, at times funny at times dumb, and way to hyperactive and hallucengenic, the only way anybody can fully enjoy any of this is probablly inebriated in some way or form. while at times  funny its far too perverted, as well as,histronic,loud,and spazy.the anime summed around the obsession of panty shots and what not and the men who sweat bullets over them....thats pretty much about it. for a show about nothing it basically serves to druggy visual remixing and hyperactive intermission cuts virtually impossiblet watch without getting headache unless your on some serious drugs. the anime is saved by the dialogue gags which actually are kind of amusing but the site gags are so over the top and unfunny its seem like typical anime humor except even more teeth grindingly unwatchable.",1127001600,2,814,5.120300751879699
2240105,4,B0007SL2MK,"The best panty related series I've ever watched...Though highly exaggerated, I could sympathize with the variety of characters...One time or another many of us fellas have done something incredibly stupid for a mere glimpse of that cotton triangle...Humorously clever in its situations, dialogue, varied character personalities...I series that isn't for everyone...But if you're the guy that takes a second hidden glance at a pantyline while at the super market checkout...this anime is definitely for you...

The animation is clean, crisp and nicely done...some of the more ""artsy editing"" between the segments occasionally becomes a little irritating, and doesn't always fit as well as it ought to...The english dub is done vary well and in some places is a bit funnier than the original japanese...ADV's little documentary is very cute...and will give a chuckle...

Not for everyone...but a very clever and enjoyable animation in its own right...",1091923200,13,949,5.493150684931507
2240106,1,B0007SL2MK,"This DVD reminds me a lot of Bevis and Butthead, but without the redeaming quality of humor.  I bought it based on a magazine review which proclaimed it to be ""insanely funny"" and a ""guilty pleasure"".  Personally, I found it to be nothing more than a waste of both my time and my money.  Rarely have I been disapointed this badly by an anime, especially one produced by ADV.  I had come to admire the quality of their work, but this particular piece of cinematic trash has definately lowered my opinion of them greatly.",1057363200,5,519,4.48936170212766
2240107,5,B0007SL2MK,"Colorful?
It sure is.
This release from ADV films is hilariously shameless. A series of loosely interwoven segments about the male libido, various characters pop in and out using a variety of art styles, symbolism (not too deep for the guys in the audience) and a bit of risque tidbits to tease as you sit back and enjoy.
I watched Colorful on the recommendation of a friend, my wife right beside me. She laughed even harder than I did. Because while this is definitely a series about men behaving badly, they often pay for it in the most extreme of ways. Voyeurism, tongue in cheek stories, and several head injuries to boot, this is one that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter.
Not for kids.
And check out the ADV behind the scenes ""Documentary"". Just how do voice actresses feel about having to do an anime with gratuitous panty shots? They'll tell you.
Fair warning. Do not buy this if you are looking for hentai. This is comedic farce all the way, and it's brilliant.",1055548800,22,984,4.533707865168539

8051118,5,B0007SL2MK,"Watched this before, lost the DVD. Ordered it again, and still love it! Some may not find it funny the first time around, but give it a chance. It got funnier for me after watching it a couple of times. That's when you get to notice the subtle funny things and that's what makes it great.

I wouldn't watch it with kids (this is not a child's anime!), but it's good for laughs. 4yrs later and I still find it funny!",1370131200,,415,4.1234567901234565
8051119,5,B0007SL2MK,Great DVD and a good anime series to unwind for a while. Nice animation and a good storyline. Funny and entertaining.,1360454400,,117,4.619047619047619
8051120,4,B0007SL2MK,"This is a cartoon about panties.  That's pretty much it.  The whole thing is a series of short episodes that have guys acting in perverted an amusing ways to try to sneak a peak up a skirt or down a blouse.  The stories of the various characters carry through from episode to episode and sometimes intertwine.  If you're expecting depth of story here, forget it.  If you're expecting debauchery and perverted humor then you've come to the right place.

The bad, well it's the filler.  A large amount of the run time, maybe as much as 20% is taken up with fairly pointless intro and credits for each one as well as a number of segways in the same episode.  It's rather annoying and made me feel slightly cheated as to the actual play length of the disk.

There is also a making of video which was freaking hilarious.  I normally don't watch special features on any disk, but I've watched that one a couple of times.  It's not the normal making of you'd expect and has some pretty amusing caste interactions.  If you can get this disk cheap then I'd recommend it.  Just to be clear though, while there's nothing actually pornographic, it's not for the little kids.",1354060800,,1162,4.502392344497608

8051123,5,B0007SL2MK,"I first saw ""Colorful"" on TechTv's midnight anime block when I was in my early teens. A period of my life largely characterized by erotic fantasies born out of an endless supply of raging, insatiable hormones, and an obsessive compulsion to feast my eyes on the physical beauty of women present in my enviorment. As far as I was concerned, those 'feelings' were for the most part untranslatable, and I might have laughed at the notion of them being communicable through the medium of Japanese animation. Then late one night I sprawled across my bed and watched ""Colorful"". As I did so, I had to wonder if my mind was somehow transforming the sensory stimuli being received from the television, because it was as though I was witnessing vivid reflectional depictions of core aspects of my then current self. In the show, I saw my own obsessive lust exemplified in the concrete form of animation to a key...Some say that animation is the language of the soul. Well, this helped prove that to me!

The reviewer ""Orbital101"" is missing the picture. It's true the characters display little psychological depth, but that is because ""Colorful"" is all about lust! The personae are there to embody and powerfully convey pure unadulterated desire, to which most media dedicate negligible time. The show succeeds enormously in this regard and should at least be respected for it, if not praised outright!

If you are seeking explicit hentai as a masturbation aid, then know ""Colorful"" is NOT for you! Episodes play out like so many sexually obsessive mini adventures: arousal - pursuit - increased arousal - minor gratification. In other words, you'll be teased but you probably won't come. The show is more a chronicle of arousing, realistic situations than sexual fantasy. Which some may find refreshing.

Visually & audibly ""Colorful"" is very agreeable. The art direction is attractive, with mostly subdued colors; the animation is pleasingly energetic, and character anatomy is surprisingly realistic for the genre; you will see a variety of models helping to keep things fresh. The English voice cast are impeccable in their crazed performances and the music helps establish moods well.

I'd recommend ""Colorful"" most to horny guys who shy away from explicit hentai. It offers plenty of eye candy and outrageous humor but also offers the viewer some perspective on sexual frustration oddly enough.",1260576000,,2391,5.060913705583756
