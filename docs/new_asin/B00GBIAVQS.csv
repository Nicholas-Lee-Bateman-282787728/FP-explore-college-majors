8621998,4,B00GBIAVQS,"Quite a bit more campy and the puzzles less clever than the prior movie or television series.  It feels like a tacked-on movie by a different writer in an attempt to please fans.  It was nice having another Liar's Game movie, but it didn't feel the same as the others, except so far that it followed the prior plot formula exactly.

On the plus side, I was surprised that this came with the first Liar's Game movie too.  My imported copy had extremely bizarre and inaccurate subtitles, so a new version with more sensible translation was very welcome!
Now all we need is for the original TV series to be re-released with the same good translations!",1410998400,,648,4.560344827586207
