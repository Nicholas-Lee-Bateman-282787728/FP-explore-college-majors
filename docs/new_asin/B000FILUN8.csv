8123355,4,B000FILUN8,"The show was pretty decent.  The undercard was the best part of it.  I also geta kick out of the behind-the-scenes stuff included on the DVD.  Ultimately, it was a reminder of how much the sport had changed.  Royce Gracie has shown how tough he is.  Who knows how long he could have taken Hughes pounding on him.  In days of old, the pounding would have contnued for as long as was permitted.  Even still, Matt showed how much MMA fighters had evolved up to that point.  Great showigs by Mike Swick and Brandon Vera as well.",1457913600,,524,4.329896907216495
8123356,3,B000FILUN8,"I purchased this DVD mainly to see Royce fight a modern top-level fighter. Royce is obviously a legend and he helped pioneer the sport we know today as MMA. Back when the UFC was in it's infancy I remember always rooting against Royce cause I just didn't like his demeanor and arrogance but always felt disappionted because more often than not he would absolutely dominate his hapless opponents.

After watching the whole event including the pre-fight behind-the-scenes stuff, I'd have to say that I enjoyed the pre-fight documentary more than the actual event itself. Most of the fights were ok. Some had moments of excitement. But overall nothing too thrilling. In my opinion this DVD is more of a rental.",1247443200,2,707,4.891666666666667
8123357,5,B000FILUN8,"I have watched EVERY UFC, Pride, Valor, King Of The Cage, etc full contact fight I could get my hands on.

The ONLY UFC fights I have not watched are 35-42, 70, 93 and later releases.

The fight between Royce Gracie, and Matt Hughes is simply incredible.

Royce was getting old at the time of this fight but Randy Coutoure was still winning UFC heavyweight and light heavyweight belts at the age of 43 (Older than Royce was at this fight).

Royce had slowed a bit but he was still a 4th degree black belt Brazillian Jiu Jitsu master fighter with all of the skills.

Matt Hughes was in his prime, and gave Mr. Gracie more of a fight than Royce was expecting. This is a fight for the ages!

Instead of listening to these 1 star reviewers or even myself I would recommend that you rent this DVD from Netflix, Blockbuster video, etc and decide for yourself if this DVD is worth buying; then buy it for your library or agree with the 1 star reviewers.

I have been in the Martial arts for 44 years (since the age of 10), and I have 40 or so of the UFC events on DVD.",1244419200,,1061,4.171568627450981
8123358,5,B000FILUN8,"I loved the event, but didn't like how they used the Matt vs. Joyce event to say the new MMA warriors are so much more superior to the old ones.  If you ask me, Joyce looked unprepared for the fight and not the same at all.  Just because he was a legend, he shouldn't have become a target to try and prove the evolution of MMA.  The only proof necessary is to watch the sport now versus the first 10 events.",1198540800,,407,4.0
8123359,5,B000FILUN8,"The Gracie-Hughes match was predictable...Hughes is much too skilled a fighter, and much too smart to fall into a Gracie trap.  Not to take anything away from Gracie--He is awesome within his discipline, but the UFC has evolved beyond the uni-dimentional fighter.  The rest of the card was, as always, a very good show.",1174694400,3,319,4.888888888888889
8123360,2,B000FILUN8,"It's always interesting seeing how a few guys will beat each other up. That certainly happened in this event. However, forget the clock, take off the gloves, throw away the rules and have a fight, somethign the UFC hasn to allowed to happen in a long time.

The thing that made the UFC a hit in the first place was that styles were pitted againt each other. To allow this to be valid, and to replicate a street fight, there were almost no rules and there were certainly no gloves. I mean, how many people have on 4 0z. gloves when they're walking down the street and some guy jumps them?

Anyway, the main event is a sham for just that reason. Gracie gets pounded by Hughes, three years after Gracie contentedly stated ""I've already fought my battles."" Gracie was not in this fight, mentally, for who knows what reason. Assuredly, he got lots of money for the gig.

All I know is that Hughes would not have been able to swing so wildly at Gracie's head without those little gloves on. He would have broken his knuckles. I'd love to see any of these modern fighters fight a 26 year old Royce Gracie, prior to his back injuries, with no gloves on and no rules. Royce's best strike back in the day was a headbutt for crying out loud, and the soft UFC doesn't allow those. Hughes is an athlete, not a fighter.",1159574400,3,1305,4.340163934426229
8123361,1,B000FILUN8,"Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.

8123362,1,B000FILUN8,"Besides ufc 61, UFC 60 is the worst MMA show of 2006.  None of the fights make any sense and you are left wondering why these guys were matched up in the first place.  The card is horrible, the matchups are even worse, and the devastating finish is nothing more or less than you expect right off the bat. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.\

Don't buy this dvd unless you are desperate.  Go for Pride 25: Body Blow instead if you want a real MMA event.

Pride FC is the top organization in the world.  Sadly, the UFC is far behind.",1152403200,4,630,4.1652892561983474
8123363,1,B000FILUN8,"Ultimate Fighting Championship is a U.S.-based mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, currently recognized as the major MMA promotion in North America.

UFC 60 was a terrible event full of mismatches and lopsided victories. The card is chock full of of B-level fighters who do not deserve nor belong on a stage as large as the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The main event is completely ludicrous;  Only a very casual fan with very little knowledge of Mixed Martial Arts would have ever given Royce Gracie a chance to defeat Matt Hughes.  The result of that fight was completely expected.  The undercard bouts consist of no-name or bush league talent that should be on free tv instead of clogging up valuable PPV time.  The only remotely interesting fights on this card come from the preliminary bouts which were not even shown live on the original broadcast.  Another thing that is ultra irritating about this event is the way the UFC attempts to trick its viewers.  They input false false fighter records(Royce Gracie is not undefeated) and spew false information to the viewer in order to hype of their product.  I have a significant problem with this.  I don't like to be spoon fed BS.

Definitely save your money on this one.  I feel sorry for you if you wasted $40 getting this on PPV and I'd feel even sorrier if anybody wasted their money on this snoozefest of an MMA show.",1152403200,8,1382,4.764705882352941
8123364,5,B000FILUN8,"UFC 60: Hughes v. Gracie
05/27/2006
Staples Center, California

For the history-making UFC 60, it is only fitting that ""The Natural"", Randy Couture be on guest commentary. It was great to hear from Randy, as always, but especially so now that he is retired. This is the most hyped UFC event I can recall since UFC 40: Vendetta, where Tito first fought Ken Shamrock a few years back. It promised to be an exciting night...

Mike ""Quick"" Swick v. Joe ""Deisel"" Riggs:
Swick comes into this fight off of 2 wins in his first 2 fights in the UFC.  Both fights ended quickly and Swick is gaining popularity, beginning to leave his print on the division. Riggs, who was once believed to be a promising contender in the welterweight division, is coming in off of a loss to Matt Hughes and a win over Nick Diaz. This fight ends quickly.

Brandon ""The Truth"" Vera v. Assuerio Silva:
Vera comes in with a lot of confidence and positive momentum behind him. He had called out Chuck Liddell after his first win in the octagon and he is slowly making his way to the top of the heap. Silva had recently lost a decision in a frustrating fight against Tim ""The Maine-iac"" Sylvia. This fight also ends quickly in the first round.

Diego ""Nightmare"" Sanchez v. John Alessio:
Alessio proves to be very difficult for The Nightmare to take down in the first round. Alessio looks light on his feet and strong in striking and elusiveness. It appears early on that Sanchez is in for his first true test in the UFC. John Alessio has been around for years, doing very well in the smaller fighting circuits. He had also made a single appearance in the UFC years back, losing to Pat Miletich- so he is no slouch. Alessio appears (to me) to win the first 2 rounds, although he does no real damage to Sanchez. Actually, neither man is truly hurt in this fight. In a strange occurrance, Sanchez gets Alessio's back in the 3rd round and Alessio carries him around for half of the round, trying not to get submitted and also trying to submit Sanchez in awkward positions. This fight goes to a decision. This is Sanchez's most difficult fight to date. People may begin to question how he would fair against those at the top of the division after a fight and a decision this close.

Alessio Sakara v. Dean ""The Boogeyman"" Lister:
Sakara is getting a good deal of attention prior to this fight for his past few performances in the UFC. Dean Lister is making his UFC debut, right after having acted as an assistant coach to Tito Ortiz on The Ultimate Fighter 3. Lister shows great ground skills in this fight that ends rather quickly.

Matt Hughes v. Royce Gracie:
There is obviously a huge buildup to this fight... It is almost surreal for a long-time mixed martial arts fan to see Matt Hughes and Royce Gracie walk the walk to step into the octagon together for their introductions. More than enough has been made of this matchup in the media, so I will get to the action. Right away, you can tell that something is very wrong. Gracie does not have the ""killer look"" that he used to have when he began in the UFC back in 1993. He used to stand across from his opponent with an intimidating look on his face. Even after submitting his opponent and being pulled off of him, the same look would remain on Gracie's face. Before this fight, Gracie looks indifferent.  He looks calm, yes, but a bit too calm, perhaps. After they feel each other out for a moment, the fight goes to the ground courtesy of Matt Hughes. Hughes secures a kimura and hyperextends Gracie's arm into a very nasty-looking position. Gracie escapes it, but never has a chance against Hughes, who eventually gets his back and brings the night to an end for Gracie, the fans and ultimately the chapter that Gracie, Shamrock and so many others opened back in 93'.

This was indeed a historic event for the UFC. For the first time, a UFC event was held at the Staples Center in California. The crowd was littered with Hollywood personalities (some of whom apparently know nothing about the sport, which is alright, I suppose) and the excitement is awesome. The main event went as most expected it to go, but the night was a huge success and marked another important step for mixed martial arts.

Highly recommended.",1151539200,11,4241,4.53202614379085
