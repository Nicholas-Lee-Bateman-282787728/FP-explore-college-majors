8620018,5,B00G0U3O3Y,"Was so excited to receive my purchase a day early. I watched the whole series in two days. Love/Hate is Ireland's answer to HBO's The Wire. It's awesome and addicting.  I know that it is an Irish series that premieres only on RTE and that one can only view the first 3 seasons on netflix and amazon instant video. I was very pleased to that I could purchase season 4 on an international DVD which would play here in the states. Overall, Amazon has never let me down. Always met or exceeded my expectations. Except for that one time they delivered my Seahawks jersey only after they had won the superbowl. That did suck but that was a one time thing so I can see past that.",1397001600,2,672,4.291338582677166
