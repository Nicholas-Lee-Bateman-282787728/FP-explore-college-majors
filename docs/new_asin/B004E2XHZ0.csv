Really great because you hear Chico Buarque's Style but there are new Versions of these pieces made by Banda Seu Chico. It's great to have the Talent to make Cover Versions without loosing the original Style. My Compliment!! Buy this DVD! Greetings from Switzerland, Dieter",1393804800,,382,4.984375
