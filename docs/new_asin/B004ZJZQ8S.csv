4509360,5,B004ZJZQ8S,I babysit my 5 grand children ages 6 mo to 5 years. Boys and girls...and WE all love George . My 5 yr old grandson loves to play the games that are on some and the coloring pages you can print from your computer are cute!  In my home George is a must. The 6 mo old is glued to him! I enjoy them as much as the kids!,1318204800,6,315,3.5652173913043477

4509364,5,B004ZJZQ8S,Curious George is wild.  He's a monkey though.  That's accurate.  I like how the children distinguish between themselves and George after the episodes in that George can do some things because he is a wild animal.  It is fun to watch George be a curious monkey in a civilized world.  There are also some educational and social situational material mixed in that older children may distinguish.,1427932800,,393,4.893939393939394

4509368,5,B004ZJZQ8S,"There are 8 short stories in this DVD. My toddler loves this cartoon very much. Except that in between the cartoon stories there are some explanation (acted out by some kids, non-cartoon type) of the concepts behind the cartoon which my toddler has no interest in. She didn't like that as I think she's too young to understand them but as a parent I think that those explanations are great and useful. Maybe my toddler will understand in another few months time.

For example, one of the stories is titled ""Monkey Size Me"". The arm length of George was used as a unit of measurement while he was preparing for a birthday party. The explanation after the cartoon was illustrated by showing the number of Georges between the distance of 2 trees. Clear and simple explanation which I think a 4 year old will be able to understand

Good buy at an affordable price",1412812800,,859,4.571428571428571
4509369,5,B004ZJZQ8S,"This DVD collection is just as high quality as the last few released DVDs. There were laugh out loud moments that my 4 year old thoroughly enjoyed. It was a great introduction to the library, subway, and drawing with a grid. An excellent investment.",1412726400,,249,4.681818181818182

4509375,3,B004ZJZQ8S,"I LOVE the $5 for eight episodes that Curious George DVDs offer, but this one was a little disappointing.  The voices/characters are a little different (Man with the Yellow Hat doesn't seem...himself), and only ONE episode is about books/library/reading! I recommend getting the ""Goes Green"" DVD over this one-- MUCH BETTER!",1400025600,2,324,5.352941176470588
4509376,5,B004ZJZQ8S,This video bring in a funny and learning way how George went to a library for the first time. He enjoyed what is a library and volunteer to work with the librarian. He made a lot of mistakes but he corrected it when the librarian helped him about how a library is organized. I recommended it for elementary school libraries.,1396915200,2,324,4.416666666666667
4509377,5,B004ZJZQ8S,I love George. He gets to do all the fun stuff and learn along the way. The trouble he gets into always has a solution. As an adult I very much enjoy the background music. Other kid shows have such obnoxious music and noise that I can't wait for it to be over.,1395187200,,260,3.9245283018867925

4509387,5,B004ZJZQ8S,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,17,827,4.235668789808917

Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875

8449980,5,B004ZJZQ8S,"Our whole family loves Curious George! That lovable little monkey is a magnet for mischief. George is sweet and well meaning but always seems to find himself in some kind of mess! He manages to learn from his mistakes though. He could be solving a mystery, being a super spy, meeting new friends, or learning to dance. My 3year old enjoys watching over and over and its one of the few cartoons that I don't mind watching too.
