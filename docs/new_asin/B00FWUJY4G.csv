8619003,2,B00FWUJY4G,"Movies are great, but they came formatted for Asian DVD players so it doesn't play in our North American one.  It will play in the computer, so we kept it.",1472860800,,155,4.166666666666667
8619004,1,B00FWUJY4G,"This is a region dvd other than the US.  Be sure you know this before ordering.  Does not work in dvd players in the United States.  Very hard time communicating with the seller.  Short and hard to understand responses.  Finally returned, but only got a partial return credit.  Money lost because I didn't realize it wouldn't function in regular players in the US.",1463011200,,364,4.698412698412699

8619007,5,B00FWUJY4G,"This is the Star Wars Prequel trilogy with both English and Japanese dub versions of the 3 films, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith. Unfortunately these are the Japanese Region 2 DVDs, which you can skip to the Blu Rays instead since the American releases are bundled with DVD copies.

I got it, but to me these are decent collectibles for your Star Wars memorabilia... unless if you want to see the Japanese dubbed version for yourself.
Well again, Star Wars Ep03: Revenge of the Sith still is a good prequel despite that it was one of the most predictable movies in film history according to The Empire Strikes Back.",1435622400,,650,4.603448275862069
