4161914,5,B003O9ZWIY,I've watched this movie twice now and it's really one of the best movies ever done on Bathory. I kind of felt sorry for the Countess as she really was nor more crazy than any other person.,1344470400,,188,4.108108108108108
4161915,5,B003O9ZWIY,"Just to clear any confusion,THIS DVD IS REGION 1, MEANING IT WILL PLAY ON DVD PLAYERS IN NORTH AMERICA AND IN AMERICAN TERRITORIES.

Although the cover art may be reminiscent of a softcore porn taking place in Medieval times, this movie was great. When I first saw the DVD cover image, I seriously was appalled. The European version depicts the true essence of the film with the actual actress, Anna Friel,on the cover. The American DVD image is insulting and I can't help but think that this was a deliberate action to entice a ""daft"" American visual palette.

With that one thing out of the way, I can certainly say that this movie is wonderful. It is artfully rendered, very dreamy and surreal, a true cinematic masterpiece. Such a gorgeous movie to watch. You can literally mute this film and watch it with stars in your eyes.

Everything I've read about Bathory is elusive and this movie doesn't escape that. We will never know the true story of The Countess or what she did/did not do.
This story takes a different approach to what we know about Countess Bathory, and I honestly was not expecting it. If you are hoping to see excessive amounts of blood and gore,this movie will certainly disappoint you. It's not at all over the top violent.

Intelligent, poignant, romantic, and beautiful, Bathory:Countess of Blood is highly recommended if you just love a great story about love, life and the tragedies that befall us all.",1343865600,7,1430,4.730923694779117
4161916,5,B003O9ZWIY,"This film is absolutely fantastic.  I've read a lot of great books about Elizabeth Bathory, but none stick quite so close to the truth as this film does. Please realize, however, that no one knows exactly what happened to her in her lifetime.  There are a lot of half-truths and false accusations about her and also a lot of mysteries, but I believe that the writer/director tied all those loose ends with her life perfectly, believably, and logically.

I won't go too far into plot with the review because I do not wish to ruin the movie for others who may be interested in watching it.

The film starts with some incredible imagery--her castle, the grounds surrounding it, and her marriage celebration I do believe.  It amazes me that the writer/director (I can NOT spell his name from memory, so please forgive me on this lol) thought enough of her story to include gypsies in the beginning because from reading about her we know that there is a very old story about her watching her father sew a gypsy man into the belly of a horse as a punishment.  He only left his head sticking out. While the movie doesn't include this tale, the gypsies playing their music and dancing in the beginning was sort of a nice nod to it I think.

I also absolutely love the fact that Ferenc Nadasdy is portrayed so accurately. His character in the film is exactly how I saw him from reading. Along with his character, the battle scenes, though few they are, against the Turks were amazing and very well thought out. I believe that those scenes were important in more ways than I can describe, but it gives a viewer a chance to realize that things during that time and in that place were not so wonderful--men (and women) lived and died by the sword--even nobles such as Count Nadasdy himself and Gyorgy Thurzo. Thurzo's character was also one that I felt to be portrayed beautifully. Though no one really knows much of what he was like, the film makes it easy to like him at first (at VERY first lol) and hate the sight of him through the rest of the film.

Other characters in the film I enjoyed were the painter whose name I cannot spell (lol) and Fitzko.  The painter was never mentioned in anything about her I've read, but there are plenty of books and things that mention her having taken a lover or two, so I'm guessing that's how his character came about.  In some places I've read, Fitzko, a servant, was supposed to have been a little person instead of the giant he was in the film, which made me sort of giggle. I feel like it was an awesome way to play with the character a little bit and show just how odd rumors can be.  Fitzko was a constant protector for the Countess and I always get a little upset when they show his execution (which really did happen, so I don't feel like that's a spoiler).

For the horror fans out there, the film shows quite a bit of blood and gore, too, but not unnecessarily at all.  There is always a reason for it, which I respect the makers of this film for.  It would have been all to easy for them to have made Bathory out to be something she wasn't. For those looking for blood bathing, you'll see a bit of that, too. There are elements of paranoia, hints to her illness, and plenty of the politics that she dealt with before and after the death of her husband.

This movie portrays her in a very real light, also.  You realize that she wasn't just the legend that she is now, but she was a person with real feelings, real heartbreak, and real issues to work through.  Throughout much of the film, you are forced to ask yourself one thing--was she a serial killer or was she just a victim of politics?

There is only ONE thing about the DVD that I absolutely hated and that's the cover. The cover for the US version is different than the original and, frankly, it isn't well thought out at all in my opinion.  The dress she's wearing isn't worn in the film and she never has on all that crazy makeup in the film either.  The newer cover does a serious injustice to the film. That being said, please don't let that stand in your way of buying it because the contents are worth a million of its packaging.",1343606400,6,4136,4.360677083333333
4161917,4,B003O9ZWIY,"Bathory (2008) is a motion picture that will satisfy the public who
has a fascination with Midieval times (not unlike VAN HELSING
(2004, from Stephen Sommers) and also ultra-realistic special
effects, of scenarios such as batter fields and close-ups of
lethal one-on-one agressions between the head honchos looking to be
the top dog.

Essentially, this long picture reaches perhaps 3 hours, divided
into 3 parts, almost as if this were a mini-TV movie series.

The mysticism is there, the realism as well. The science fiction
aspect is very strong as well, at times, with a feel similar to
that of a comic book adopted to silver screen.

The sensuality aspect is modest but present ...and not unlike
HOSTEL 1 (from this identical region, Slovakia) there is a scary
aspect to the movie as well ...not for the squeamish.

As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the questions are
raised, but then, the answers are left unanswered.

The upshot, is that this film has a definite European feel to it,
coupled with Franco Nero's acting (albeit short, always welcome)
and takes viewers traveling into another storybook world .... yes,
controversial, as is the case with many European movies. But
comic-book inspired enough to not be taken literally or too
academically. It's very good entertainment, and the special effect
alone are worth the price of admission. Worth applauding.",1336262400,,1377,5.075221238938053
4161918,3,B003O9ZWIY,"I got the dvd today and was all excited to watch it, but as soon as I stuck it in the dvd player I found out the dvd was from the UK! They failed to mention it!

4161919,4,B003O9ZWIY,"This is a film that has been made with Czech and Slovak money, it is based in Hungary and Transylvania and is served up in English - welcome to the new Europe. It is a take on the life of Elizabeth Bathory. She lived in Hungary in the sixteenth century and has gone down in history as the biggest female mass murderer of all time. She is still credited in the Guinness Book of Records with that particular title.  She was married at an early age to the Prince and soon becomes the number one lady.

They are more or less permanently repulsing invasions from the Moslems and Turks, so the power struggles and alliances tend to ebb and flow with the ferocity of the invaders attacks. They also have a young Caravaggio, who they capture from the Turks who ends up dipping more than his paintbrush and adding some altogether much needed artistic gusto to the whole proceedings.

Anna Friel does a spot on job and is both beautiful and believable in the role. There is an however and that is in the portrayal of Bathory herself. Legend has it that she killed over 600, virgins and bathed in their blood to preserve her beauty, and that she was a bit of a vampire (well you would wouldn't you). This is all sort of glossed over and she is presented as some herbal bathing Florence Nightingale. This has caused some consternation amongst vampire/horror fans who were hoping for a bit more fangs and blood. Instead we have conspiracy theories that go all the way to the Vatican. As is said in the film, ""people like legends more than the truth, and some would say that is what you should have made the film about then.

That said, there is quite a bit of blood letting and it is all done very well, there is also some good battle scenes and some great backdrops and good cinematography. We also have a witch, dream sequences and a very well portrayed journey into madness. What does take away from the film is the dubbing. This was filmed in more than one language and the English dubbed on after, it is not always obvious but the sound become s a bit seventies Kung Fu on a number of occasions - pity.

That said this as an ambitious and evocative movie, Director Juraj Jakubisko has woven a great story and told it almost beautifully. He probably could have benefitted from some editing as this runs to 135 minutes, but I would be hard pressed to say what should have been cut. If you like a good costume drama love, battles and some rather good acting, then you will not be disappointed.",1319414400,2,2482,4.422319474835886
4161920,3,B003O9ZWIY,"I came across the myth and history of Bathory reading Raymond Mcnally's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DRACULA-WAS-A-WOMAN/dp/0709015569/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DRACULA WAS A WOMAN</a>&nbsp;some 8-10 years ago. In actual history Bathory, a Hungarian Countess, is widely thought to have been a mass murderer of young woman with some figures putting the number of of deaths at her hand at 650 and this spawned the stories of 'the Blood Countess' bathing in the blood of her victims. But the actual circumstances of her alleged crimes are very much debated with some doubting Bathory's guilt at all.

This uncertainty regarding the infamous events of Bathory's life is echoed in the opening words of the film where the narrator observes at the film's outset that ""the fewer the facts the more plentiful the legends"".

Bathory is an imagined retelling of the legend of the Countess - but, as other reviewers have said, those expecting a horror film will be disappointed. As a film it is a good piece and Friel's depiction of Bathory was very well done. It is an engaging story with some stunning sets.

Recommended, although not especially strongly.",1316304000,,1192,5.538461538461538
4161921,5,B003O9ZWIY,"I enjoyed this movie very much, it was a bit dark, but so surprizing.  The movie is in english and the accent they speak it makes it a bit hard at times to understand, but this movie was done so well, I don't think the story could of been told any better in movie format. It is a one of kind unique experience, I am glad I own this.",1304812800,,332,3.8115942028985508
4161922,5,B003O9ZWIY,"So many myths and legends exist about the life of Erzsbet Bthory. Though I have found a lot of it to be interesting, it's also ridiculous. So I tried to approach this movie with an open mind. I must say it is more fascinating than some people give it credit for. Instead of focusing on the myths, it reveals a more believable portrait of the countess.

It's more historical than it is a Gothic story, which makes more sense. I'm tired of people relating this woman to Gothic exaggerations. In any case, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The scenery and the costumes are gorgeous, and the music flows beautifully. The story itself pulls from a lot of different directions, which works, leaving off with a heart-felt ending. It explores the possibility that she may have been guilty of some things, but the rest of it could have easily been a scandal and a timeless exaggeration [considering it was a turbulent era in history when woman weren't considered important, and people could easily be swayed into believing anything when given a price]. She had power and, being a woman, it was considered dangerous.

I would recommend this to anyone interested in Erzsbet and her often misunderstood story.",1286236800,7,1201,4.797101449275362
4161923,1,B003O9ZWIY,"The one star is for the film's elaborate sets and cinematography, which truly recreate a feeling of being in huge castles and on horrific battlefields in the middle ages.

But it's easy to see why this film is taking so long to get a North American release.  It is very very long, very very boring, and very very pointless.  The Goth/vampire crowd who might be attracted by the title will be disappointed by the portrayal of the Blood Countess as an innocent pawn, framed for crimes she didn't commit.  The arthouse crowd will be put off by the films pretensions to be something more than what it is.  It is like a horror film without the horror!

The film takes the position that Bathory was innocent of the crimes for which she was sentenced.  Which is fine; there is some debate about whether the charges against her had any basis in fact.  But is it necessary to portray her as a ""modern"" woman, ahead of her time, almost saintly in her daily dealings with others?

The story begins with Erszebet in her childhood, betrothed to Stephen Nadasdy, who later becomes a fierce warrior.  It proceeds through to her adult life where the rarely-home Stephen causes her to miscarry their child by drunkenly forcing himself upon her.  The film then proceeds, very slowly, through a series of court intrigues by which it becomes apparent that the Countess is the richest woman in Hungary, and that she in fact owns more land than the King himself.  Needless to say, this brings about plotting among those who envy her.

The film then proceeds through a completely meretricious and sometimes unintentionally funny series of events by which the legend of Countess Dracula takes shape.  A man is found dead, having been killed with a two-pronged device that Erszebet gave one of her servants for protection.  Vampirism is discussed among the superstitious villagers.  A maid sees Erszebet and an artist friend cutting up a corpse, which of course they are doing in the interests of art.  The red liquid in which she is seen bathing is really reddened by herbs to restore her ailing health.  (This is particularly galling, since the famous stories of Bathory bathing in blood did not begin to circulate until literally centuries later!)  We are even told that one of her serving staff was slipping her mushrooms to cause her to have paranoid hallucinations!  The necessity of this is hard to fathom.  If the film is taking the stance that Bathory was framed for her crimes, why create any basis for them at all?  Why not just say that witnesses LIED on the stand?  The scenes that show the Countess being misunderstood are almost along the lines of saying Al Capone was not a gangster, but one of his cronies fell against his baseball bat 97 times!

Add to this the antics of the two monks investigating the Countess, who have at their disposal middle-ages versions of everything from roller skates to flash photography!  These scenes are obviously meant to be amusing, but far more often they are merely irritating.

The simplest and best approach to a film about the Countess would be to have the film begin with her trial.  Through the testimony of the witnesses, we could see the spectacle of the Bloody Countess in all her excesses.  Along the way, the film could have one of those investigating the Countess find evidence to indicate that much of what is being said may not be true.  Of course this evidence is suppressed.  This way, the filmmakers could have their bloodbath and drink it too!

Was Countess Erszebet Bathory the most vicious female serial killer who ever lived?  Or was she the innocent victim of a far-reaching conspiracy to claim her lands and wealth?  Or was she something in between, a cruel and haughty noble who treated those around her the way all nobles did, but was taken down for it only because she had powerful enemies?

It is an interesting question, and we will probably never know the truth, but films like this certainly contribute nothing to the debate!",1278115200,27,3982,4.723188405797101
4161924,3,B003O9ZWIY,"we just don't know for sure because this period of history in that part of Europe was really  awful. It was in constant warfare and the turks weren't defeated in their attempt to crusade for islam until the late 1600's , this is the late 1500's period. And there's no doubt that it was a bloody age. And that a woman left in charge of a area would have to order the deaths of people etc. In this movie we get a version of the countess that shows her to be brutal and yet doing good things as well.  It's a long movie, but one does wonder if the truth of the countess is closer to this picture?. We just don't know which is correct. She may have been the bloody killer who slaughtered for blood , or perhaps she killed a few people like in this movie. Unlike count Dracula whose massive killing was known by everyone , we get stories from a single town and castle. So what was the truth?  This is a interesting take on the countess of blood historical  story.  It would be interesting to know the real story though. Was she the complete monster we know and fear? Or something less? This movie took a bold step to tell a story that is plausible and it is not boring imo. It is a very long movie though. It's around 3 hours long. But it is a well done show. You decide which version you enjoy of this historical figure. I do like ""the countess"" starring Julie Delpy a lot. Or the earlier countess movies , and there's a number of them going back to the 1970's. One starred the great Ingrid pitt and that one is worth watching for sure. This one is long but, who knows how much this reflects the real countess. The acting in this one is superb though. The lead actress puts in a major performance here, and that's a good thing. the dvd looks great though and it's worth owning if you like historical dramas. This does feature bloody scenes though as you would expect.",1369958400,,1863,4.22191011235955

4161927,5,B003O9ZWIY,"I actually agree with nearly all of the reviewers whether they liked this movie or not. Each reviewer has a perspective that is hard to argue with -- simply because the facts in this case -- the historical records -- are too meager to know the truth for certain. This is a lavish costume piece, European style, and is a European movie. Many North American viewers may not warm to it because it was not what we expected. There were moments of boredom and moments of excitement. No vampires, no grotesque spectacles of blood, but a few decent-enough battles. The unusual inventions of the monks seem outlandish at first pass; however, similar inventions had cropped up from ancient Greece forward. These were one-off inventions referenced throughout Europe and the Middle East. Lacking the machine-tooling and production lines of the modern industrial age,these inventions survived the death of their inventors only as a memory or sketch. Noble women had access to the highest education and possessed the privilege of money and time to develop themselves and so Elizabeth Bathory's skill even as a swordswoman did not phase me either. As a PhD in European Military History, I thought the political intrigue and dynastic rivalries were spot on, as well as how a noblewoman was portrayed in that vortex with all of the strengths and weaknesses that were representative of the times. I had read the books and legends associated with Bathory, but do not claim to be any expert. I bought the legends at face value. Now I wonder where legend and reality begin and end. This is exactly what the central European director and scriptwriters were trying to achieve. Two considerations cause me to pause and not dismiss this movie as fantasy in whole or part. First, thirty-four years either as a military officer or a modest government official have taught me much about how administrations, personal greed, power elites, and machinations can take a good person -- or an unfavored person -- and demonize them, even if innocent. With so much land and wealth at stake, and situated in the middle of major rivalries encompassing the Imperial, Hungarian and Turkish elites, Elizabeth Bathory made an excellent and profitable target. Second, there is at least one other figure, Richard III of England who was similarly portrayed as a monster for over 400 years. I studied Richard for a year and find myself in complete accord with the Ricardian Society that has almost entirely vindicated his reign. All of Richard's supporters were either killed in battle or supressed politically, almost all records attesting to his good kingship were destroyed by the succeeding dynasty, the Tudors, legends replaced reality -- of course written by the victors -- and his portraits were altered to present a man of evil. Why are the records about Elizabeth Bathory so meager? The testimony of paid or tortured witnesses are abundant enough. Hopefully, one day, we may come closer to the truth, whether she was the monster of legend, or the heroine that this film suggests. And the truth shall set us free.",1366329600,9,3075,4.961240310077519
4161928,4,B003O9ZWIY,"This is not a story about a vampire who stays young by bathing in the blood of virgins. This is an embellished version of historical events.

This is the story of Elizabeth Bathory (Anna Friel) who lived during a time of conflict between the east and west and Catholic and Protestant religions. She was able to survive one, but not the other. This tale depicts the countess as slightly mentally unstable suffering from a disease of the blood. There are scenes which blend reality with dreams in a surreal fashion. It worked rather well for me, but there wasn't a lot of it. Bathory was ruthless and beautiful. In an effort to gain her wealth, her enemies accused her of heinous crimes, at least some of which were true.

What you will first notice is the costumes. They went to great length and expense in this aspect reminding me of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon.""  Some of the background is CG, such as the castle with its constant full moon and some of the fires. The monk and his assistant made inventions which made this account seem fictional. Indeed, both of them and the Italian artist appear to be Hollywood creations. Anna Darvulia is historical, but her exact influence is unknown. The film is long: 2 hours and 20 minutes. It moves at a slow and steady pace. You do feel the time. This movie is a not for everybody. It is artsy and based on a true story. It can get boring building background.

This movie that in many countries was released direct to DVD has within the few years of it's release become a huge cult classic. This movie supports the argument of the possible innocence of Erzabet Bathory of the supposed crimes that became her downfall. At the death of her husband, Erzabet was left a powerfully strong woman whose wealth and land ownership did not sit well in a greedy male dominated domain. The film explores ideas of how historically her story may have been miss-represented and set up by the other nobles who would profit from her downfall. Yes there are a few fantasy elements like the inclusion of the artist Caravaggio into her life and the delightfully priest with his brilliant yet anachronistic inventions but it all makes for a good strong story in the end.",1359158400,,860,4.8175675675675675

It kills any sort of dark or creepy mood. It really isn't a vampire movie or a serial killer movie. More like a historical Hungaria movie where castles and maidens roam. There's not much to say about this movie other than a lot of money and time went into it, but it failed to captivate me within what feels like an endless run time.

4161932,1,B003O9ZWIY,"This film has two great attributes, namely exquisite cinematography and Anna Friell, who is also exquisite  and a wonderful actress whom I have admired in a number of her other film and television appearances.  But I simply can't get past  the film's total distortion of available history. Nor will it do to simply say that ""nobody knows"" what Elizabeth Bathory reslly or did not do. While no history is absolutely reliable, in the case of Bathory we have transcripts of her trial in which she found guilty of  numerous atrocities and acts of unspeakable cruelty inflicted upon her slaves, servants, villagers and peasants whom she used , abused and exploited. Because of her high station she was not  executed for her crimes, , but instead walled up in a castle where she could commit no further crimes. Her underlings on the other hand were ordered by the court to be tortured to death as punishment  for the the terrible crimes which they committed on Bathory's orders and for their mistress' amusement and pleasure. That her conviction may have served to alleviate the debts owed to her by her debtors is hardly evidence that rebuts the sworn testimony of so many witnesses at the trial who were not her debtors. It is true that there was no real evidence of her bathing  in blood or being a vampire (a story concocted after her death by imaginative fiction writers bent on sensationalism), but ironically that is the only part of the story the film depicts, although even that is watered down by the suggestion that perhaps it was only herbal red dye she was bathing in. But the available evidence and trial transcripts leave no doubt that Bathory abused her almost absolute power as mistress within her castles to  inflict unspeakable cruelties upon those subservient to her. While the theme of the film could have been that power corrupts, that absolute power corrupts absolutely,  or even the power of beauty itself, it instead catered to the tiresome  vampire cult, even while dressing it up in admittedly gorgeous cinematography. Perhaps four hundred years from now a film maker will make a film depicting Jeffrey Dahmer as a basically nice guy who was just misunderstood by those who had it in for him.",1346803200,19,2213,4.8153034300791555
4161933,3,B003O9ZWIY,"Here we have another take on the Countess Bathory legend made in the Czech republic for, it seems, a television mini-series served in three chapters.  Its a great example of sacrificing sumptuous images over characterization.  Actress Anna Friel is excellent as the countess and there is also a surprise cameo from Euro actor Franco Nero but the script tends to lean more to a story of treachery over land ownership and also a psychic form of brainwashing done by an old seer who seems to be the catylist in the blood bathing.  Bathory is portrayed as a character placed in the middle of all this badinage and was wrongly done away with by the boujoir intrigue of the plot.  Director Jurai Jakubisko also introduces a monk and his young apprentice into the mix as the supposed early journalists of this affair who take down all of the events and present it for historic value. The director has them resembling the characters of Sean Connery and Christian Slater in Director Jean Jacque Arnaud's 'THE NAME OF THE ROSE'-1985 and if you want to stretch it a bit further, Jack MacGowran and Director Roman Polanski in his spoof 'THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS'- 1966.  The monk is also portrayed as an early inventor as he escapes from an ambush Da Vinci style in an early form of sky gliding.  The elements in the films favor are the beautiful photography, costumes and sets, and an excellent music score including Simon Boswell in the themes.  The director credits himself as Writer, Director and Painter and rightly so for each frame could be frozen on your monitor and displayed as a painting.  However, all that good stuff can over whelm the viewer. There are some passages which make absolutely no sense or just shown for their audacity to increase the running time causing the characters to become nothing more than card board cut outs and making the actors drown in all of the films beauty .  Director Stanley Kubrick was severely criticized for this exact method when his visual masterpiece 'BARRY LYNDON'- 1975 was released and is still judged to this day.  Screen Media presents it in a beautiful 2.35 transfer and the three stars are for the elements just described. It's like they always say, print the legend instead of the facts.  We cannot go back in time to find out the truth but Director Jakubisko presents an interesting take on Countess Bathory.

8401521,3,B003O9ZWIY,"Depiction of a strong woman, ahead of her time ruffling the feathers of the sexist men of her time. Did she actually bathe in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth? This film says no and I won't say anything else to give anything else away. This is more of a historical take on the incident rather than a mere film.
The Countess is ahead of her time and the men can't handle it and plan her downfall. Overall, it was too long and drawn out of a film.",1429833600,,455,4.066666666666666
