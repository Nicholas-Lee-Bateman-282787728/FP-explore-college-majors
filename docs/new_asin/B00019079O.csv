It isn't bad like ""Pluto Nash"" bad (ie: funny bad) or ""Godzilla"" bad (low budget), instead it is one of the most convoluted, pretentious and self-important films ever made.  The plot is actually interesting for a little while, but the movie suffers from ""art-film wannabe"" complex, meaning that the director thinks that confusing plot and dialogue make for classy, understated art.  It is as if they thought ""hey, some pedantic critic will find a theme/deep meaning for this work if we make it dark and use sparse dialogue!"".  All the more confusing is the use of American and British actors in what is essentially a French film; the bad French accents from the leading ladies is distracting and annoying.  While it is generally well-acted, the performances reek of pretense and self-importance.  Worst by far is the writing and the editing, which conspire to render this all but unwatchable.  If you want a good euro-thriller, rent the original Dutch ""The Vanishing"", but stay AWAY from Demonlover.",1082505600,13,1063,4.938202247191011
1979330,3,B00019079O,"You also have quite a few detracting problems.
I must say, I'm surprised that there are no reviews for this item and I'm writing the first one. But then again, this movie has by-and-large, flown under most people's radar, and perhaps for most that is for the best.
I should probably say I hovered between giving this movie 2 or 3 stars for a while before I settled on 3. 2 seems to say ""This movie is not worth watching"" while 3 better says what I feel - ""Might be worth watching.""
Demonlover is a corporate intrigue and espionage film that seems to take place in the not-so-distant future, and concerns an employee named Diane who (ostensibly) works for a corporation looking to buy out a hot 3D cyber-pornography company called TokyoAnime. Also interested in these dealings are the fiercely, deadly competitive corporations of Demonlover and Mangatronics. The movie gives the impression that nobody is really what they seem in this movie, from Diane's boss, to her assistant (played by Chloe Sevigny), but you know, none of this really comes as any big surprise. Diane is not an ethical character, so when she gets more than she bargained for in finding out about a covert and dangerously-interactive S&M site, and soon... well, I don't want to give too many plot details away, but Diane raises the stakes for her own reasons...
After this, the movie descends into a sort of surreal, confused madness, sort of like the turn David Lynch took with Mulholland Drive, but... er, not really.
So, what's the problem? Well, for me, this movie never really distinguishes itself as or decides what it wants to be. It tries to put on some airs like it has the chops to be a high-concept art film, but a lot of it has that shoddy, direct-to-video, Cinemax pseudosexual thriller feel to it. This DVD is the R-rated version, and if you're looking for some direct, serious titillation, you'd probably be best served to look elsewhere, as more is implied than anything else.
I consider the photography and the cinematography to be pretty bad - I understand what they were trying to do, but I don't like the final product. As I said in my topic title, some parts of this movie are slick, if they had gone more with the slick, stylized photography instead of the ""What the hell am I looking at"" school of photography, I think the results would have been superior. This is a movie with flashy people, multinational corporations and high-tech cities, about pornography and voyeurism. A movie like this demands superior shooting and photography, which, especially in the latter parts, it does not deliver.
Many people will claim that the plot has no inconsistencies, and it takes you on the same wild, find-your-own-meaning ride that other, superior films do, but it doesn't. It tries the whole ""confuse-you-to-make-you-really-think"" ruse, but it's handled so ham-handedly and with such amateurishness that for me it doesn't work.
But this film is an interesting one at least, there are interesting elements to it, but I'm not sure I can recommend it. It's not horrible, but I'm not certain I could call it good. It's a fair movie, could have been *leagues* better. But, like I said, it feels less like a high concept art film than it does one of those sleazy-without-too-much-sleaze direct to video throwaways.",1080172800,12,3293,4.819787985865724

Principally the problems in dealing with this movie -- aside from oft-unarticulated but crucial factors as: what else was playing that week, whether the review was executed under deadline or not, how the reviewer was feeling that day, etc. -- is the ""disconnect"" implicit in most filmgoers' identification with the protagonists offered them: a CIA agent gone rogue (for ""the good of country""), a high-powered lawyer, a spy, a bunch of schmucks who do little more than hang around the water cooler like us but, hey, have deeply meaningful and tragic and romantic and comedic lives after all, don't we all, right?

1979402,2,B00019079O,"This is sloppily made espionage stuff with a backdrop about some huge S&M porn ring that is torturing women and producing some type of harder porn ... shades of ""Videodrome"" ... with a bit of ""Hostel"" in the mix.

The story's silly, so the next bet for a redeeming feature is the style?  The director aims for sensory overload but it falls flat to me.  The whole thing is reminiscent of lots of 70's cinema, when many directors produced choppy films (plot holes, strange editing) that aimed for some type of hallucinatory ""higher truth"".  I discerned no higher truth here.  The only redeeming feature to me is looking at Connie Nielson for the film's duration, she's a good-looking woman. And probably, if that made me want to see her get systematically raped, I'd have enjoyed this movie more.",1367884800,,794,4.72463768115942
1979403,3,B00019079O,"I love Olivier Assayas (Irma Vep, Late August/Early September, Carlos, Summer Hours) but this film is overly dark for my tastes. That is not to say it is a bad film because its not. In its way its as good as Assayas' other work, its just not as appealing. Demonlover works as a companion piece to Irma Vep as it explores the same terrain (the nature of identity or lack of identity in its main player) but its not as playful nor as fun as Irma Vep and at 2+ its overly-long.

Demonlover features a great quartet of main players all vying for positions of power (corporate and sexual). But I would argue Assayas makes three mistakes with this film: 1) he doesn't give us anyone to like. 2) he casts Gina Gershon (who essentially plays the same crass sex kitten every time she appears onscreen) to play a fifth and unnecessary character. 3) he pushes the material in darker and darker directions as if intentionally trying viewer patience/tolerance levels.

Some critics argue that this film is a comment on internet-age perception/communication. But its more specific than that (and less far-reaching). Its simply a comment on the porn economy. And the film veers dangerously close to participating in that economy.

Again, I really like much of Assayas' work, but I'm not as enthusiastic about this one.",1364428800,,1303,4.756637168141593

It's a film that lacks morality as the limits of corporate espionage takes place among characters that have no limits. The limits of depravations are played out in extremely lurid fashion. The underground torture sites on the world-wide web reminded me of the HOSTEL films as a Corporate agent played by Connie Nielsen finds herself as an abducted star-player on a torture web-side THE HELLFIRE'S CLUB while a young boy in a surburban home steals his father's gold card and logs into this illegal web site as we are about to witness the online torture of Nielsen. It has all the elements and mise-en-scene one would expect in this genre. There's technological voyeruism, deprave sexuality, corporate exploitation and globilization, espionage amongst corporate giants and the backstabing exploitation of office politics with characters who decieve one other for corporate gain.

That said, this surreal, intentionally obtuse story of corporate intrigue centering around world domination of anime porn, makes less and less sense, climaxing with an ironic twist you can see coming from several miles off, and leaving one with the feeling that the film is slightly less intelligent than one might have hoped.  But it did improve on a second viewing.  While the ending still bugged me, the odd, slightly irrational middle felt more in control and intentional, more a comment on its main character than I caught the first time around.",1308355200,,738,4.833333333333333

1979409,3,B00019079O,"Note: Presented in French with English subtitles.

The 2002 release `Demonlover' directed by Olivier Assayas starts out as a immensely intriguing exploration into highly unethical, cut throat big business practices, both corporate and individual, as carried out in the high tech, Asian erotic world of Anime fantasy and cyberspace. I found the initial premise to be not only fascinating, but extremely relevant in today's overly indulgent, dangerously narcisstic environment. With such a unique storyline the possibilities seemed endless and I joyfully settled back for the ride.

Imagine how disappointed I became as I watched this wonderful storyline devolve into a ""I saw what you did"" revenge plot involving office politics, a missing body, kidnapping, drugs, and internet porn. To further complicate matters an excruciatingly slow tempo, terse dialogue and obscure direction make it increasingly hard for the audience to maintain focus to the end.

Despite the overall good production values and strong cast the mismanaged, convoluted script places this film in the category of ""what could have been, but wasn't"". If it hadn't been for the presence of the seductive Connie Nielsen I don't think I would've been able to continue to watch all the way through.",1258070400,2,1262,5.395939086294416
1979430,2,B00019079O,"Demonlover: 4 out of 10: Wow what an overlong train wreck of a movie. Before I begin to scratch the surface of the ineptitude of this film let me explain the few things Demonlover does right.

Demonlover does some things very well. It has individual scenes that work on their own either as erotic vignettes; (Chloe Sevigny playing videogames in the nude , an Asian girl seducing a French man at a club after his lover leaves.) or plot actions (dosing a bottled water with Halcion) before the film ventures down the rabbit hole twenty odd minutes in.

So how can a thriller dealing with bondage and Hentai and starring Chlo Sevigny, Gina Gershon, and the hot redhead from Devil's Advocate, Connie Nielsen, possibly go wrong?

Well for one thing, there are cloistered nuns that know more about marketing animated porn online than writer/director Olivier Assayas does. I often complain about movies where the writers and director have clearly never worked in an office (13 Going on 30 for example) but this is over the top. The French, as an example, are worried about a secret website that makes lots of money. If the website makes lots of money' wait for it' it probably is not a secret. Moreover, I am sure that cornering the online Hentai traffic is an unattainable goal. After all, how hard is it to draw new tentacle porn?

In addition, I doubt many corporate spies scale the sides of buildings or poison colleagues. Moreover, with the silliest script this side of The Core you cannot depend on the ever confusing and contrived plot.

I know I praised the sex scenes above but with this cast, I was expecting more, a lot more. Also I often did not know where the movie was taking place. (are they in Tokyo or France is a popular game you can play.)

Then there is the car chase, at the end, that looks like an outtake from Vanishing Point. (As Tom Servo would have said 'Meanwhile in another decade')The film is overlong, very confusing, somewhat boring and the characters IQ's seem to drop every scene. After the fifteenth fade to black transition, I actually screamed 'end already' at the screen.

In reality, this seems to be a badly done remake of Videodrome. Olivier Assayas is clearly no David Cronenberg. He cannot even tell a simple story in a believable and entertaining manner. Or take advantage of three of the hottest actresses in the business.",1248912000,4,2359,4.683574879227053
1979431,5,B00019079O,"This is a haunting, intriguing, well-written film, much more intellectually developed than could be determined by the name.  Chloe Sevigny gives an outstanding performance.

She gives a chillingly cold-hearted performance in ""Demonlover"".",1232236800,2,366,6.0
1979432,5,B00019079O,"Demonlover is a very modernist film which deserves to be alligned with the great dystopic novels of the previous century, ""We"", ""the Iron Heel"", and particularly ""1984"" with one proviso its primary impact as opposed to literary is videogenic.

It tells the story of a corportate executive, appropriatly female, who will go to any lengths to succeed according to her on self-defined, narcisstic standards at odds with her objective appearances and in stark contrast to others expectations. Brash and domineering she uses a free floating cynicism to treacherously sell her corporate secrets to others for monetary gain thinking self-assuredly that her private intrique and machinations are curiously invioable, just as many criminals do. This is the first half of the film, in the second part of which so many critics don't like, all this ballsy swagger is shown to be an act of utter self-deluding fantasy; she has underestimated her antagonist and she instead of manipulating the system for her own gain she devolves into a most contemptible slave to it.

DEMONLOVER is a little too stylized for its own good - its focus on form completely overwhelms its paper thin storyline.

1979436,3,B00019079O,"""Demonlover"" is a great looking, inspired film that is ultimately unfulfilling but pretty damn entertaining for the most part. The movie stars Connie Nielsen ('The Ice Harvest'), Chloe Sevigny ('The Brown Bunny'), and Gina Gershon ('3-Way') and is about a woman named Diane (Nielsen) who poisons a woman named Karen so she can take her place as head of a company that produces animated pornography. Sevigny plays Elise, her assistant who can't stand her and Gershon plays a pot smoking American executive. The movie is simalar to a indie-film called ""The Dying Gaul"" (while that film was much better). It doesn't want to stick to one genre, it wants to go wherever. This film touches base on several genres; Drama, Anime, Action, Comedy, Theatrical-Soft Core Porn...Not in that particular order. The performances are inspired, the animation is great...But, I don't know. It just didn't strike a lot of notes for me. The movie is in French, English, and Japanese...Mostly in French. Apparently Nielsen already speaks fluent french, but it's impressive to see actresses like Sevigny speaking it. I must confess though that it mihgt not even be the story that was a turnoff for me, here's what it might've been. Mid-way through the film, the characters begin talking about an online torture site called The Hellfire Club. What we see of this club and what becomes of one of the characters at this club, are some of the most effective scenes of the movie. This might be just me, but I wanted to know more about the club; I think the plot should've surrounded that little sub-plot a bit more than it did. Jumping into the bonus features; Palm Pictures isn't really a sucker for bonus featuuures but their features are almost better than a lot of mainstream films are. Here you'll find interviews with Nielsen, Sevigny,

Charles Berling, and writer/director Olivier Assayas; I only watched the Nielsen and Sevigny intereviews, but they were quite interesting. The second complaint, although this doesn't add or subtract any reasons for me liking this film. The lack of nudity. The preview of the film makes it look like nudity is almost a plot point; But, here you only see Nielsen naked briefly and there's a teasing scene that has Sevigny lying on a bed naked (on her stomach) with her feet up therefore blocking any t 'n' a shots that might've been there. Anyway, basically what I'm trying to say is...Cyber-geeks will be impressed.

1979437,5,B00019079O,"Can I go ahead and say it. ""WOW"". I wasn't sure what I was going to be getting myself into when I first picked up this film, but I had heard that it was up for some awards at Cannes, so I knew that I had to see for myself what the hype was all about. Again, all I can say is... ""WOW"". This film felt like a David Lynch story spiced with a bit of Francois Ozon. You never knew what was going to happen next and you didn't want to know. This film pushed you to the edge of the couch and kept you there for the entire two hours. The music, the acting, and the beautiful (and I mean beautiful) cinematography completed this wild and gritty masterpiece.

Now, before anyone says something to me concerning the fact that I rented this film merely for the pornography would be making a very false statement. The pornography aspect of this film is very large, but in the same stance it is very small. Director Olivier Assayas is trying to make a statement about our societies infatuation with sex and the use of the Internet. He succeeds with the greatest of ease. Demonlover is one of those films where if you take away the pornography element, you would be left with still a very strong story. In fact, you could replace the pornography portion with any online business venture and you would still have a very frightening and political film. So, for those of you that think that this is nothing more than a pornographic film, I beg to differ. This is a story about our society and culture. It is a depressing story about the lack of respect for human life. Assayas hits this on the head with the ending when we watch our questionable hero becoming a subject for a teenage kid. The teenager does not see a life on his screen, but simply a business transaction. A cartoon or fictitious character, when in reality it is not.

This film could not have worked so well if it were not for the actors. Connie Nielsen gives a brilliant performance of a woman who knows nothing and understands even less. She is being played by others that are not whom they seem they are. Nielsen is in the majority of this film, so it is up to her to help carry the story, and she successfully does it. She keeps the audience guessing, and her facial expressions force us to feel sympathy for her as the second half unfolds. Chloe Sevigny also is outstanding. I sometimes think that she just picks films that are random and as tangent as possible from the latest film that she did. She is a versatile actress that will have her name soon enough honored with an Oscar. It also wouldn't surprise me to see Nielsen there as well.

Demonlover is the great un-Hollywood film that I have been waiting for.  While it may be difficult for some viewers to enjoy, I thought that it ranked among the best that cinema has to offer.  It is bold, expressive, and deeply rooted within the passages of our culture.  Dark and disturbing only begin to describe this film.  This is not for the faint of heart, but for those that love challenging cinema.

1979438,2,B00019079O,"Leave it to the French to dream up this kind of slick but empty Eurotrash techno-""thriller"" that plays like an awkward one-night-stand between ""Rising Sun"" and ""Muholland Drive"". Still, I found ""Demonlover"" oddly watchable, (at least once) mostly due to the pleasing eye-candy provided by the attractive female leads. Long static shots of characters sitting around in boardrooms trying to out-Trump each other with corporate intrigue are broken up by occasional, badly-directed ""action"" scenes (I've never heard of Oliver Assayas, but I can tell ya he certainly ain't no Luc Besson!). Only those caught dozing won't see the ""surprise"" ending coming about 30 minutes before it happens. It certainly doesn't help the viewer to have characters inexplicably switch languages in the middle of some already muddled and mumbled conversations, a device which one begins to suspect was written in only to let the actors ""show off"" thier multi-lingual skills. In the hands of a skilled Anime director, this may have actually worked better as a Manga, as the plot has many of the elements you find in the graphic novel genre. It certainly would have been more of an interesting visual experience, if nothing else. An interesting failure.",1123632000,6,1226,5.196969696969697
1979439,4,B00019079O,"I walked out of the theater I caught demonlover in a couple of years ago sure I had witnessed a garballed movie ruined by a windbag need to be abstrusely ""difficult.""  I'm not sure that assessment is wrong, per se, but since watching the movie, it's never quite left my mind, and I found myself purchasing a copy to watch it again.  On this viewing, I'm far more kind.  Its first hour is a top rate corporate thriller full of cunning acting and mesmerizing developments.  Then, midway through, Diane (Connie Nielsen, in her only great performance to date) wakes up in a hotel room and the movie jumps through one of those Lynchian rabbit holes we call ""Lynchian"" to pretend we understand them (as if being deliberately unclear could be a calling card).  The hallucination the movie becomes in the second half is a sort of half-cocked nightmare critique of soulless business practices, of the way the immorality of a corporation's practices and products can take over the essence of who its practiotioners are.  Or so I think.  Olivier Assayas lets the wind out of his movie for about an hour straight even to get that far, and it leads to narrative frustration, but I can't say watching this movie a second time that that frustration is necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, it takes me a place that I don't even go with David Lynch movies - Lynch is much more an artist of the hallucinatory.  demonlover is, at heart, a movie of fairly innocent ideals told for maximum complication in a manner whose riskiness becoems its initial biggest weakness.  Given another shot, you may find that riskiness returning you for another round, as I did.",1121126400,5,1637,4.672473867595818
1979476,2,B00019079O,"In spite of the interesting title, 'Demonlover' is not a horror film.  Olivier Assayas presents his vision about the today's violence on the Internet, porn films (Japanese anime-style), and fierce competitions between companies.  But the results are simply an awful mess, unconvincing and even laughable at times for anyone who knows better than this French director.

The film's central figure is unlra-icy Connie Nielsen as Diane, kind of business person nobody comes to like.  No wonder, for hard-working Diane is actually a spy in the pay of another company, which is desperate to get a contract with 'Tokyo Anime.'  And to get what she wants, Diane even poisons the bottle of mineral water her superior Karen is going to drink.

This seemingly orthodox thriller turns something different after a while.  Diane, now in place of Karen, travels to Japan where she negotiates with the anime company that invented 3-D porno-anime.  Since then, Diane is drawn to the underworld of the Internet site where a hoodwinked woman is seen tortured.

However, 'Demon Lover' refuses to concentrate on the topics that are intriguing, if not original.  By the time you finish watching half of it, the film gets more and more confusing, losing the thread of the story, intentionally or not.  Chloe Sevigny appears as Diane's ill-used secretary, who gives a few surprises to Diane.  Fine.  From America, Gina Gershon arrives for the business negotiation.  Between her and Diane, something happens (surprise again), of which reasons or outcome, nothing is explained.  Finally, something shocking happens to Diane herself, but by the time we see it, because of the murky story and impossible situations, we just stop caring, thinking 'So what'?

[WHAT'S THE POINT?] In one interview, Oliver Assayas said he didn't use the traditional storytelling techniques on purpose, having done that in two previous films.  Whatever his reason may be, the results are only a series of confusion, and the lack of logics is just terrible.  This two hour long film has little to say about the ever-changing world of business, animation, or Internet. And what little it has, it is nothing new.

Of course, some of you might find the film interesting for the same reasons.  It is true that the film is often given power enough to unnerve us with strong visulas.  The film really wants to show the relations between money, Internet, and violence very seriously, but stylish visuals are not good enough.

After all, however, the most damaging thing about the film is that what Assayas's film presents here looks, even at the time of its original release, old and incorrect.  The 3-D manga-style porno film is not as new and innovative as the film thinks; the 'hellsclub site' idea (a very crutial part of the film) has already been seen in films like '8 mm'; and as to the 'cut-throat' nature of the business world, well, the anime industry is surely competitive, but not so fierce as to really cut someone else's throat.",1119139200,8,2985,4.973790322580645
1979477,2,B00019079O,"Movies which begin with an interesting premise and then proceed to allow that premise to disintegrate are usually in that predicament because of an incomplete vision by the filmmaker of just what it is that he really wants to say. At this point story goes out the window, and what story cannot provide cinematography and editing are asked to substitute. They are used to hide the fact that the story has either disappeared or there never was one in the first place. And that is the main problem with Demonlover.

The director shirks his responsibility here. In similarly mind-entrapping movies like Fight Club (my favorite of the genre, brilliantly conceived and executed) we are yanked and cranked, our senses are stretched, things are not what they seem, but it all makes a kind of weird sense in the end. It does not cheat its own pre-established logic.

In Demonlover there is no proper logic (and it takes itself way too seriously - often a bad sign). Fantasy can have - must have - some internal logic by which it operates. It may not be a logic we are used to, but it does contain a logic of some kind to which it must be true. With Demonlover there is no internal truth, no operating system, no soul: we are simply hung out to dry. For example, in this R-rated version at least (I cannot speak to the NC-17 version as I have not seen it. Evidently there are twelve more minutes in that version though I have no idea what those twelve minutes consist of) the sly promise of titillating sexual perversion is danced around for two hours and then, finally, shied away from entirely leaving even that vain promise unfulfilled. There are murders that do or do not take place. We are never shown what really happened. And my supposition must be, in this case, that the director is using the tired - but still apparently fashionable - dodge of saying, well, you, the audience, you decide what is real and what is not real. Because I can't. This is a huge and utimately dispiriting cop-out. It's not artistic license here but artistic failure, a failure of courage and conviction. For an artist - if, indeed, not for all of us - that is the worst kind there is.",1113004800,6,2160,4.535897435897436
1979478,3,B00019079O,"I absolutely loved watching this movie for the first hour. I disagree with comments slamming the visual style - the slick, over saturated, nervously jumpy, and tremendously atmospheric filming work perfectly to pull us into Diane's growing obsession with (or dependence on?) the over stimulation of the high-tech porn aesthetic. Moody and atmospheric, this film is filled with eye candy ranging from gorgeously detached shots of Tokyo to loving studies of Diane (played by the lovely and here compellingly transformational Connie Nielsen) and even a light smattering (though very light for those of us watching with one hand in our jeans) of hentai and 3-D porn. The movie is completely successful at setting up compelling characters, intrigue, and settings, but as so many other reviews suggest, it does fall apart on story. I spent ninety minutes thrilled, ten minutes just plain confused, and then seventeen minutes disappointed when I realized the film had left not only our reality (which is to be expected) but also its own. It could be argued that we ended up in what was left of Diane's reality but I'm working here to force up a story...the film figuratively and literally leaves us stranded in the desert. There's an unpleasant whiff of pedantic moralizing (the more we become involved with sex, violence, chaos, and objectification the more we...uh...become involved with sex, violence, chaos, and objectification) and a few shrill moments that break the otherwise flawless amoral, multinational, descent-into-helpless (and/or desired) submission to the commerce/sex/violence triad trance of the film, but there's still a lovely, liquid quality to the journey that successfully comes to a boil just a few seconds before evaporating completely.

And it is, overall, worth watching. The cinematographer and director come to the table with powerful visions, the soundtrack is the closest thing to an emotional through line we get, the acting is persuasive and absorbing, and the sets are fascinating and fully actualized. Now, if there had only been a writer involved, we might have really had something here...",1104192000,5,2119,5.306547619047619
1979479,3,B00019079O,"Olivier Assayas creates a visually stunning film in a dark world where multinational corporations invest in anime porn with further interest to invest in 3-dimensional animated pornography.  The investments in 3-D pornography attract large amounts of money as several clients seek investment opportunities.  This also creates an atmosphere where corporate espionage becomes a tool to maneuver competitors as it could lead to a monopoly on the market of animated pornography.  The only thing that drives the people in the business of animated pornography is the trail of money, which becomes a path of greed, violence, and murder.

The story begins on a plane flying from Japan to France where Diane de Monx (Connie Nielsen) poisons one of the executives in her company in order for a rivaling company to gain access to information in a briefcase.  This leads Diane into a spiraling exploit as she is put in charge of the Japanese account that manages the business of animated pornography.  When she enters the business transaction she is aware that she is being followed by an unknown source.  Nonetheless, Diane takes charge of her position and advances through the world of pornography while balancing it carefully with the company and the laws of France.  However, she displays no concern for people as she ruthlessly proceeds in order to further her self-interest.

In the environment of Diane's own self-interest there are other people that are also looking out for their own interests by counter-espionage.  This leads Diane into a world of internet pornography and sadistic elements of interactive torture over the internet.  These people are, however, much more ruthless than Diane as they have no limits to how far they are willing to go in regards to making money.

Demonlover becomes a quagmire of moral values as Connie Nielsen's character wanders a path where she loses herself to pride, greed, and desire.  On this path Diane finds herself lost and in a desperate attempt tries to survive as her life soon becomes expandable.  Assayas intends to display the corruption of the character and how this corruptive treatment affects the awareness of the character in an uncompromising situation.  Initially the story flows smoothly as Diane's life does, but as Diane becomes entangled the story loses itself very much like the character loses itself in the complex environment of deceit and greed.  This provides an interesting point of view which is similar to David Lynch's Lost Highway, but Assayas never creates the hallucinatory effect that Lynch does and the film does not regain its balance as it becomes apparent what has happened to Diane.",1096761600,16,2657,5.129930394431555
1979480,1,B00019079O,"I'll keep this brief, because a long critique would imply that the film is a substantial enough work to require a thorough going over. It isn't.  If you're morbidly curious, you'll find plenty of on-line discussants here who have imagined a far more intelligent film than the one I seem to have seen.

The story--and I use that word reluctantly--is about some very, very, very big businesses that are involved in buying and selling. They are promoting, merging, importing, exporting, doubling, tripling, dot-comming in expensive offices with bathtubs.

People must hurry. Everything is important. Secretaries have to run over to Kinkos at 3am to make copies of pie-charts.  Do you have the file??  It was supposed to be on my desk an hour ago.

Someone's head will have to roll.  We cannot let ""Competition, Ltd"" get even one whiff. Or one Sniff. Imagine, a sniff for some snuff. People getting porno'd to death:an idea whose time has come and whose come is timed--no one should get more than he's paid for.

Speaking of which, payment that is, the theatrical run of this mess grossed under one million dollars, world-wide. I am only greatful that so few people shelled out money to see it. With so many really good ""foreign"" and ""indie"" movies hoping to get a crack at commercial exhibition, we don't want to reinforce the negative impression that many ""meat and potatoes"" film-goers have of anything that doesn't carry the USDA seal.

Thank you for allowing me to vent, and believe me I'm happy that there's a whole bunch of us who are starved for some real Substance and Beauty. We may disagree sharply over a particular film, but together we have let the film industry know that there's actual money to be made from ""Art"".

She's spying for a rival, and at a certain point seems to fall under the control of an American company. (Gina Gershon is fun as the American's representative). It's also implied that Nielsen's character may not be who she appears and is the pawn of SOMEONE ELSE..... the intent is to create a mood of David Lynch-like weirdness but instead it's just confusing.

1979485,3,B00019079O,"This highly sensual film uses the slick Emma Peel-in-a-skintight-jumpsuit-meets-the-Matrix veneer that most people associate with high stakes business acquisitions, fast cars and corporate espionage . . . and for the first half of the movie, that is exactly what is delivered---intrigue on a multi-national and multi-million dollar level showcased in exquisitely neoned Japan, overseas business class flights and minimalist board rooms.  Diane, played to perfection by Connie Nielsen is the Emma Peel of a French investment house intent on acquiring a monopoly on Japanese animated pornography.  Perfectly dressed and coiffed, she epitomizes the business woman who has it all:  brains, savvy and a polished understated unfluctuating demeanor that make her hard to read and hard to penetrate.  We watch her intriguingly non-react as she puts a woman colleague out of commission, discovers that someone else knows what she has done, make deals with an Internet pornography competitor on the metro and all around suppresses her intrinsic sense of womanhood as she stands by and watches----no smiles apologetically----a piece of Japanese anime explicit with enough sexist content to render anyone with the vaguest sense of feminism a bad case of the hives.  The fimmaker's vision of people in general in a world consumed by a consumerism so out of control that it feeds off its own negative energy, is blurred; the defining line between men and women eroded by a viciously amoral competition.

Then comes the second half of the movie where so many things seem to happen for no real reason at all.  Yes, we can see the varying factions surface as the desire to win control becomes more sharply delineated---but instead of making it all work somehow, where the message, although hidden, can be revealed by some careful consideration, the series of images seem to just run amok.  At the end, Diane has reformatted herself a la Laura Croft to deliver the consumer with that which he desires.  The message: I am unsure---perhaps intense interplay produces human anime with little sensibility other than winning the competition and delivering product.  An unhumbled Diane glares out at the world from a computer screen---is she beaten---no---she has just metamorphed.

This film is not recommended to everyone.  Those looking for a fluid plot will not be satisfied with its second half.  However, if you enjoy the sense of the real world being shrunk even smaller in a global marketplace where nationality and language are no longer real issues and the Internet serves as a conduit for salving any desire, you may enjoy this director's vision.",1083888000,26,2633,5.210900473933649

8008240,2,B00019079O,"Before I go into any level of detail about this movie (which honestly won't be much), I should say upfront that I expected more from this since it's supposed to be part of this New French Extremity. What I ended up getting was rather tame and, worst of all, just plain boring at times.

 The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around several people who work for a few different companies. One is TokyoAnime, who specialize in animation and manga; the second is the titular Demonlover, a website where people can watch hentai; and the third is Mangatronics, Demonlover's primary competitor. There's also a torture site called Hellfire Club which may or may not be run on the sly by Demonlover. I suppose that last site could have made for a more graphic and explicit film if they'd chose to focus on that, but no, all you get is a dull slog about corporate spying among companies who just happen to deal with some rather sleazy stuff. However, there's only really one scene where you get to see exactly what this content is and a lot of it is blurred out.

 Moving on, the acting in this movie was passable although it's not what I would consider great by any means. Connie Nielsen and Gina Gershon, in her limited screen time, come off the best but mostly because their characters were the least annoying. Another major fault of this movie is writing. Aside from a lack of coherence in the general storyline, the characters are all varying degrees of unsympathetic and, at times, grating to the ears. Chloe Sevigny is probably the worst offender, as there are scenes where she'll lurch from calm and sedate to bitchy and screechy without much motivation or reason. On the whole, there is not a likeable character to be found and the confusing plot didn't do them any favors at all.

 On a technical level I can sort of give this a pass because it was low-budget, so it wasn't too unexpected that most of the film was shot up-close and handheld. Most of the time, they gave you enough of a look at what was happening so that it wasn't visually disorienting. Still, there are a couple of scenes in which this filming style is detrimental. One was a catfight between Connie Nielsen and Gina Gershon's character in which it's often hard to tell who's hitting who and where they exactly are at any given moment. The other was a chase scene towards the end.

 Overall, given the subject matter, or at least what I thought the subject matter was going to be, I have to say this film was a disappointment. It was overly confusing, poorly written with unlikeable characters and, worst of all, rather boring. With such sleazy content involving animated porn and torture sites, they chose possibly one of the worst angles to approach it from and certainly one of the least compelling. It kind of improves in the last 30 minutes or so, but that doesn't excuse the nearly 90 minutes that came before it. If discussions about contracts, clauses and market share are your cup of tea, by all means check this out. For me, however, it was just a dud and waste of my time and money.",1416700800,3,3069,4.547101449275362
