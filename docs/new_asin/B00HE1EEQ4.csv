6155712,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"When people see ""Animated"" they automatically think ""Aha! It's for kids!"" and bring them to the theater. Imagine their surprise when they figure out that this movie is biographical, about an ill-fated love affair and the man who designed Japan's ferocious ""Zeros,"" Mitsubishi's World War II fighter planes. Dialogue about ""extruded aluminum alloy"" and ""flush rivets"" for a ""smooth skin"" probably went right over the kids' heads, don't you think? This is just as well because the children won't automatically think of Pearl Harbor or the War in the Pacific.

I was dismayed to discover that the version I attended was in English, so I'm afraid I missed a lot; I expected it to be in Japanese with subtitles. When I realized my mistake, it was too late to go to the lobby and ask for closed-caption glasses. Oh well... My companion filled me in as best she could afterwards.

There were many ""name brands"" providing the English-speaking voices, but I'd rather talk about the characters:
  * Jir Horikoshi is our main character; we follow him from childhood, see how he is inspired to design airplanes by reading about an Italian aeronautical designer, his engineering studies and his demanding employment at Mitsubishi. (We also see some of the failures.)
  * Caprioni is the Italian designer. (He has wild dreams and a large family!)
  * Honj is Jir's friend and fellow employee at Mitsubishi. It is so satisfying to see two honorable gentlemen treat each other with respect.
  * Nahoko Satomi is the lovely (doomed) young woman our hero loves. Her illness was another aspect of the film that escaped the youngsters in the audience.
  * Kayo Horikoshi is our hero's sister; she was one of my favorites because she was in a perpetual snit, which masked her loving heart.

We also have an impatient boss, a Swiss acquaintance, parents, military fellows, landladies and various other characters. (Miyazaki creates delicious characters whose movements are authentic and breathtakingly real.)

To me, however, the main reason to watch this Oscar-nominated film (Best Animated Feature) is to admire the exquisite art work. Every frame deserves to be mounted on a wall somewhere. There is nothing quite like Hayao Miyazaki's meticulous work, whether he is writing the story, drawing the frames or directing the movie, he is one of a kind. His previous works include ""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""

This is PG-13; it includes no profanity, nudity, warfare or gunfights. We see the Great Kanto Earthquake which occurred in 1923, but again, no blood or horror. It includes a tuberculosis epidemic, but we mostly see patients wrapped snugly at a sanitorium. We also see heavy cigarette smoking because pretty much everyone smoked in the 30s and 40s, so that is a non-issue.

See the amazing artwork! And with the DVD from Amazon, you will be able to select the language and subtitles to suit your needs.",1393804800,14,2926,5.002061855670103
6155713,5,B00HE1EEQ4,this sway song finale by master filmaker by HM is amazing i saw it in the theathers this early aftermoon i had never cried in a movie before until now the ending broke my heart it was amazing him at his best A must go,1393718400,18,217,3.8444444444444446
6155714,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"The trailer for The Wind Rises only hints at some of the film's secrets, but it's worth a look if you are completely new to the works of director Hayao Miyazaki. This is not a slick Disney production in 3D with modern graphics, but a softer 2D watercolor piece. All of Miyazaki's movies use this style and it can be disappointing for some. I find it utterly beautiful.

If you are familiar with Miyazaki, the important thing to note is that The Wind Rises is different in tone to all of his established classics. This is a movie set in the real world, and it tells the story of, Jiro Horikoshi, who designed Japanese fighter planes during the second world war. I was worried that the story might disappoint, as I love Miyazaki's fantasy worlds, but all of the magic was present.

One thing I should mention immediately is that this is not a story that is likely to engage young children in the way that Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro, or Kiki's Delivery Service did. The two main themes are Jiro's passion for his work, and his love for a woman. People usually expect something light and family-friendly from animated movies, but this one includes a heartbreaking death and feelings that the very young would probably not understand.

Miyazaki uses a number of dream sequences to establish Jiro's passion for his career, so you'll see him walking along the wings of planes designed by his Italian hero, Caproni. Jiro gains experience by working in European countries, and we watch him and his friend develop their young careers.

One of the most charming things in the film is Jiro's love for Nahoko. The two have a chance encounter on a train when he is a boy, and he ends up saving her and her mother when an earthquake devastates their surroundings. Again, these scenes might worry or confuse small children.

The detail in the animation is incredible, despite the old-fashioned style. Miyazaki often puts in seemingly unnecessary detail, but it adds realism to the story. Watch the small stones rolling when someone jumps off a train and you'll understand what I mean. Another thing that adds to the depth of the story is Miyazaki's willingness to address issues that are rarely explored in the animated form. For instance, one major character suffers from tuberculosis, which afflicted Miyazaki's own mother from 1947 to 1955.

I hope that I'm not persuading you to give this film a miss with all the dark subject matter. It's an incredibly beautiful story with characters you'll really care about. The English dub features an incredibly strong array of talent and it works wonderfully. When Frozen wins the Oscar in a few hours from the time of writing, I won't be surprised, but The Wind Rises is just about perfect and deserves to win.

The story affected me deeply and I had to fight off tears in places. If I had been watching at home by myself, I would probably have been sobbing by the end. But that would be because of the extraordinary beauty present in the film and its characters, rather than true sadness.

If this is to be Miyazaki's final film, it's a great way to end a magnificent career. I was totally engrossed for two hours, just as I have been in the vast majority of his other films over the years. The Wind Rises might be remembered as his Grave of the Fireflies, but that shouldn't prevent you from seeing it. It's further proof that animation can be important as well as entertaining.",1393718400,95,3408,4.668333333333333
6155715,2,B00HE1EEQ4,"Recommendation: watching this movie requires a certain degree of caution.

This is the story of a Japanese aeronautical engineer who designed several airplanes, including the now-famous ""Zero."" It sounded like a good story -- one that I would like, since I spent a considerable amount of time as an aviator -- but, in fact, it was really an example of revisionist history at work. It personalized and glorified this individual, and then explained him away as someone merely committed to designing the best airplanes he could because he so loved aviation. Perhaps that was so, but the fact remains that the airplanes he designed were used in a brutal and aggressive war. His airplanes saw action in the Rape of Nanking, the invasion of Manchuria, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and all throughout the hellish Pacific Islands campaigns. This movie made him look ""innocent"" in all of that -- and, thereby, by association, the Japanese nation, as well -- by disassociating him from the consequences of his efforts.

It seems to me that the Japanese have, at times, been quite astute at trying to revise the history of their involvement in WW II. This movie, albeit done subtlety, is just one more example of that.

Let me paraphrase Confucius by saying ""(we should accurately remember) the past if we would define the future.",1393718400,28,1319,4.9058295964125564
6155716,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along?

The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.

My favorite character is Mr. Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams.

My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.

The message in this film is, ""Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect."" Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, ""Did you have a good ten years?""

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18-year-olds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film!

6155717,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Miyazaki is an animation genius who got his start drawing airplanesand so his last film before retirement is about a kid who grew up to design airplanes. I can't help but wonder how autobiographical this is.
  This film encompasses one half of everything that makes Miyazaki great. Miyazaki came out of retirement once before and made Ponyo. That film carried his Speilbergian love of childhood, his whimsey, his environmental political views (its in small doses and does not ruin the film for a second), and dreamlike art on the border between terrifying and heavenly. That is half of all Miyazaki films that appeals to kids. The Wind Rises is the other half. The side of Miyazaki that loves flight and engineering, tides of tragedy, and the little beautiful things lost in plain sight in the lives of his characters and makes you cry with hope.
  Beautiful animation and a fitting swan song for the director of the best animated films of this century..unless he comes out of retirement again just to make a comedy action movie to balance out Ponyo and The Wind Rises, but you can probably watch Castle of Cagliostro instead ;)",1391040000,199,1128,4.798969072164948

6155723,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Hayao Mayazaki movies are frequently excluded from top ten anime lists because if they weren't, they would BE the list. 'The Wind Rises' is no exception. Ostensibly about Jiro Horikoshi, Mayazaki spins a tale of a boy who is in love with flying, but, but because of his poor eyesight, can never be a pilot himself. He becomes an aeronautical engineer, is attracted to a girl he helps during the Great Kanto earthquake, sees the repression of pre-WWII Germany and Japan, is reunited with the girl, falls in love, and in the end, makes the most of his '10 years in the sun'.
This could have just been about airplanes, but Mayazaki has a too good of a sense of for what makes a good story, so we get a biography, a history, and a love story, and the dozens of other things that make this a whole and complete movie.",1524528000,,812,4.3841059602649

6155728,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I'm not in the Miyazaki sycophant fan club. The movies are usually so boring, so dull (storyline and coloring), with no action and no point. Also the blissful marriage between Japan, Italy, and Germany is enough to make one nervous. And the half-tech steampunk nonsense is so uninteresting, much like watching black and white home movie after movie of someone learning to ride a bike. The obsession with vehicle transport is just not my thing.
Taking that into account, this was one of the most engaging Miyazaki movies. Yet another little boy from Japan who loves airplanes, Italy, and Germany. What I appreciated most was the history, however accurate. Seeing the disparity between country and city life, as culture progressed, advancements were made, and the pressure to compete with other nations of the world with technological achievements.
Because of the character's interpersonal life he becomes slightly less neutral extant being and someone you could mildly, blas-ly root for. I can appreciate the author's sentiment that war is not the end goal of technology, but is that how engineers working contracts for the military during war time actually feel?",1521158400,,1162,5.1861702127659575

If I understand this correctly, he designs the Zero. But I don't think the film reached that point.

I cannot emphasize enough how great this animation is, Studio Ghibli has really overdone themselves this time. The way the artists had framed the pictures here are really masterful. Even if you watched this movie with the sound off completely, you would be able to take away SO MUCH.

Though, the voice acting and the script of the movie put this onto a whole other level. Even though these characters are really just sketches, you really do feel for them, in their happiest and saddest times. In their most inspired, and most defeated.

Going through Jiro's life, starting as just a kid with magnificent dreams, and those dreams becoming a reality once he is older is so incredibly inspiring. The way Jiro is portrayed, and the way he interacts with different people really stood out to me in this film. He is SO different when he talks to his beloved than he does to his friend, or sister, or mother. Studio Ghibli really aced it there.

She literally lies around the hose waiting to die so that he can go off and ""live his dream,"" which is designing a war/murder machine. And he intentionally compartmentalizes the negative effects of his work and simply chooses to ""forget"" and ignore them. The plane is pretty, right? So who cares if none of the pilots ever came home. And the ending is particularly bad. In his dream, his deceased wife tells him to just go off and live and forget about her. I wanted to gag.

I had been a Miyazaki fan since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>. But this movie as made Miyazaki collector out of me. This is a beautiful, poignant, intelligent and uplifting movie. While Spirited Away is a movie experience every parent should share with their children; The Wind Rises is one everyone can enjoy. There is some violence, not esp graphic, no bad language and some topics may be tricky for the very young there is no reason why this cannot be a cherished family movie night experience.

More than the mere story-line, this s a beautiful, and beautifully made movie. So much so I hesitate to say more than:
Miyazaki and the artists at Studio Ghibli hand draw and color some of the most beautiful art quality animation anywhere.

Our story begins by establishing Jiro as a good person with good values and a life-long passion for flying. He has poor eyesight, so becoming a pilot is not in his future. He is a natural, and imaginative engineer instead he becomes an aircraft designer. In this he is inspired by a dream based relationship he has with his hero Caprioni,  full name, Giovanni Battista Caproni, 1st Count of Taliedo a real and famous Italian aircraft designer.

The time is the Japan the years following the Great Earthquake of 1923. It is this earthquake that so brilliantly begins the movie. If you are going to be an aircraft designer in Japan your best hope for a job will be designing war machines. In fact The Wind Rises is the fictionalized real story of Dr. Jiro Horikoshi the designer of the (among others) the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. One of the most effective fighter planes of WWII. The tension between this otherwise gentle and good hearted man and the events that led him into building killing machines begs the viewer to think about this movie long after watching it.

Some will argue that Miyazaki sugar coats life in Japan under near military dictatorship. Others will point out that we never see the horrible things Japan did to people in invaded countries. Jiro does become a suspicious person and is hunted by the Japanese Secret Police, but he is hidden and protected by his employers. In sum these are legitimate objections but they would not have been part of Jiros daily awareness. In other word these much harder questions belong in another movie.
More central to the movie is the relation between Jiro and his wife. Their marriage is a central theme in this movie. Much of this is fictional and does not represent the actual events of the real Horikoshi.

So far this is the last movies that filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki says he will direct. He has retired about six times to date so we can still hope.",1483315200,6,2825,4.92436974789916

6155850,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"While highly fictionalized, The Wind Rises tells a touching biographical tale of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aircraft engineer in World War II. But don't get it wrong, this isn't just another war film. It tells a touching, inspiring tale western audiences may not often see; that of a civillian of the Axis Powers and the skepticism and shaky alliance with Germany. But at its core, it is the story of a man and his love of aircraft and tragically destined soulmate.

Viewers will likely be familiar with Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese Tim Burton (If titles can be imposed on such an enigma), but for newcomers, or even those put off by the bizarre worlds of Nausicaa, Spirited Away, and Howl, this pure historical fiction film will be instantly accessible. If this is indeed to be Miyazaki's final feature-length work (edit: It's not), it caps his recurring themes of man vs. nature, flying, destiny, and love, just as Nausicaa, his first independent work, introduced those very themes.

A great film for animation fans and history buffs alike, though its melancholy themes, lack of fantastical adventure, and tragic romance may not be entertaining for children, and it does touch on adult themes. It is PG-13 for a reason.",1481241600,,1221,4.922330097087379
6155851,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Excellent film.  Some liberties where taken with the actually history (mainly his wife), but all movies like this do such things.  Defintiely would recommend the film though, especially if you're a fan other Ghibli works.",1481155200,,221,5.285714285714286
6155852,5,B00HE1EEQ4,Another amazing story from Studio Ghibli. I doubt I could ever give them less than 5 stars. The story and art are amazing as always.,1480896000,,132,4.32
6155853,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Of the more recent Ghibli films, ""When Marnie Was There"" is my personal favorite.  ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" definitely is the one with more universal appeal.  But ""The Wind Rises"", though lacking the psychological intrigue of Marnie or the flash and bang of Arrietty, carries the very definition of the heart and soul of Miyazaki in relation to his craft.  If one is seeking a first Ghibli/Miyazaki film, I would have to say that this one would not be the best as it does not feature Miyazaki's magical world in it's fullest brilliance (as stereotypical as it is to say, ""Spirited Away"" still holds the title for ""Best Ghibli Intro"").  But, if one was seeking a film to better understand who he is, this would definitely be my first recommendation.

Content Issues:
Nothing to worry about.  However, this is not a children's film...it's meant really for the adult audience because of the the heaviness of some of the themes.

ABOUT THE FILM:
""The Wind Rises"" is a semi-biopic of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the prime engineer/designer of the legendary Mitsubishi A5M Zero Fighter plane (WWII).  To be more exact, it's an adaptation of Miyazaki's manga of the same name...which in turn was loosely based off of the short story, ""The Wind Has Risen"" by Tatsuo Hori.  In essence though, it's not so much about the life of a single individual (or really 3 in this case) as it is a discourse on the fragility of beauty, focusing one one's goals, and how artists/engineers deal with the desire to construct beautiful things in a broken world that can quickly mar it.

And that's the thing about this film, in dealing with the struggle of engineers who just wanted to build beautiful planes that they and their country could be proud of versus the notion that these planes will eventually be used for war, it was rather excellently and delicately handled.  The way they tackled it was definitely more sensible than either extreme position one could take...and it was also a very understanding position, too.  It definitely was an angle that I never really thought about before.

Story:
In terms of story, it is moving and poweful...but somewhat quick (though not rushed) since it spans Jiro's childhood to adulthood.  The romance is believable, his loyalty, too...and his imagination is wondrous to see.  But I wouldn't say this to be the best of the tales Ghibli has put out.

Visuals:
They are good, vibrant, and detailed...but they are not particularly astounding when compared to Arrietty, Marnie, or Spirited Away.  If anything, this film feels the most ""real"" versus a lot of the fanciful/magical elements used in a good chunk of Ghibli films.  And just to clarify, I'm not referring to whether magic or spirits make an appearance...but rather the feel.  If anything, visually, it's more of an update on ""Only Yesterday"".  Again, not a bad thing (and it fits), but it is not the best visual showcase.

English:
As these releases go, besides the original Japanese, there is also the option of English dubs.  Marnie's and Arreitty's respective English dubbing impressed me...but not so much this one.  It's passable, didn't really hurt my viewing at all...but it did not seem as powerfully presented as in the prior mentioned ones.

Special Features:
There isn't much here in terms of extras.  Only the Storyboards, original trailers and tv spots, and announcement of the completion of the film.  The only one that seemed interesting enough for me was the production interview/inside look of the process of making the English-dub.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a great film to understand the essence of Miyazaki.  In addition, it is also a great film that discusses issues of beauty in a very balanced and intelligent way.  Besides that, loyalty and love of his art and of his wife is really touching.  It may not be the greatest Ghibli film...but it still is an important one.",1480377600,5,3871,4.838905775075988

6155857,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"The last Studio Ghibli film is typical of Hayao Miyazaki's creations. Lovely to look at, engrossing and to some, radical and honoring a man who created one of the most dangerous planes of WW2, the Mitsubishi AGM Zero. I put that aside preferring to just watch this for what it is, a fable about a man who wanted to fly, but physically was unable. Therefore he created planes. In this, his dismay at the violence they're used for and most of them being destroyed saddens him. Since this is a Miyazaki film, it's worth seeing.",1478563200,,524,4.526315789473684
6155858,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"This is a (semi) biographical work about Jiro Horikoshi, an aircraft engineer and designer for Mitsubishi.  As with other titles from Studio Ghibli, this is beautifully animated in more traditional 2D style (little or no CG here...the number of person-hours put into animating this must have been staggering), and is simply gorgeous.  Attention to detail is superb, and as an admitted airplane geek I can say that the aircraft depicted are overwhelmingly done so with accuracy.  Mitsubishi's 1MF10, A5M, G3M and Ki-20 all make appearances (the A6M Zero makes a cameo appearance at the end), as do the F.13 and G.38 from Junkers, and the Ca. 60, Ca. 73 and Ca. 90 from Caproni.  The Kanto earthquake of 1923 also plays a key role in the plot, and happens as per history.  Voice talent is (as usual) superb, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Martin Short, Jennifer Grey, William H. Macy and Mandy Patinkin.  Daily life of 1920's and 1930's Japan appears wonderfully well researched without making the film look like a documentary, which it is not.
The reason I say this is that while the technical aspects are accurate, the story of Jiro's life is not.  It's still a wonderful love story, just not the story of this designer's personal life.  Unless you're a real history buff, this won't detract from your enjoyment of the film.  It's told in the typically whimsical, gentle style of Studio Ghibli.  The only departure from their usual MO is that fantastical elements of the story are limited to dream sequences instead of constituting the body of the film.  That made pacing of the film a little slow at times, and at just over two hours it's a fairly long animated feature.  Porco Rosso was probably paced a little better.  But the animation is so stunning, who cares?  I didn't realize this was director Hayao Miyazaki's swan-song, but he definitely left on a high note.",1478304000,,1898,4.854037267080745

6155862,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I'm not sure what to make of it, to be totally honest with you. Normally, Miyazaki's movies are about whimsy - immersing the viewer in home-spun worlds that could never be. And this wasn't that... it wasn't Grave of the Fireflies, either... but Hayao certainly wasn't being lead around by his usual muse with this film. It was an odd choice of projects to go out on, and it didn't exactly end pleasantly - in fact, the message of the movie seemed to be that all dreams, no matter how glorious, are stained by the reality of wakening. Now, of course, that's true - often very painfully. But it's not the kind of baggage I expect to lug away from a modern Ghibli film, especially not (potentially) the studio's finale.

The heavy-duty cigarette smoking was a bit of a turn-off for me, even though I am aware that Japanese men do smoke heavily. This film had a great cast of very talented American actors that I thought were very well chosen.

6155866,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"On the surface, this is about as odd a choice as one could imagine for a swan song; for his final movie the great Hayao Miyazaki decided to do a heavily fictionalized but nevertheless biography of the man who invented several Japanese fighter planes, including the Zero,... and not much else.

It is not that Jiro Horikoshi didn't deserve a biographical film; after all he is hardly the first or the last brilliant aeronautical engineer to have his greatest achievements devoted to military conquest, and as he himself revealed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zero/dp/1596879874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zero</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eagles-of-Mitsubishi-The-Story-of-the-Zero-Fighter/dp/0295971681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eagles of Mitsubishi: The Story of the Zero Fighter</a>&nbsp;he wasn't exactly told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth at the time by his dictatorial, secret keeping government.  However, his biography seems an odd choice for a children's film, especially the claimed final work by one of the greatest animators of all time, and closer examination makes it odder.

The best parts of The Wind Rises are without doubt the several dream sequences Jiro has at various times (though his continuous meetings with Giovanni Caproni are more likely due to Miyazaki than Jiro), but anyone interested enough to seek out the real Mr. Horikoshi behind the cartoon will come across more and more disturbing changes because Jiro didn't do much besides design fighter aircraft, and if he did, he didn't describe it much in his writings.  Thus, an awful lot of ""The Wind Rises"" involves Jiro researching or eating, which however important in real life doesn't exactly build excitement on the screen, and a disturbing amount of the more exciting scenes were completely fictional.  Let's take them one at a time.

Jiro didn't smoke, which made him something of an oddball at the time, but as bad as it is for the health, smoking is so good for acting that I'd normally let it slide.

Jiro apparently wrote nothing about the Great Kanto Earthquake though he lived through it.  Again, one wishes there had been something original to base a film on, but I'm not going to complain much about this.

Jiro had an older brother not a younger sister.  This matters more.  Japanese women, like women most everywhere at the time (especially in Asia), were second class citizens and learning that Jiro's more liberal than most men's views were entirely fictional is more disturbing than usual in light of the following.

Jiro's wife did not have nor die of tuberculosis.  This matters a lot.  As Hayao Miyazaki has freely admitted this was entirely fictional and borrowed from Hori Tatsuo's novel The Wind has Risen (1936-7), and you have to wonder why.  It is one thing to play any sort of games you want in fiction, but truthfulness matters in biography, even in (especially in?) animated biography intended for children.

Ordinarily, this might leave even his most devoted fans, like I used to be, shaking their heads and wondering what went wrong, but Miyazaki has already left us a clue in his previous film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-s-Moving-Castle/dp/B00BEYYEIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl's Moving Castle</a>&nbsp;(along with fellow Ghibli Film member Isao Takahata's odd career:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B008XEZXRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-Yesterday/dp/B01E9O0Q0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only Yesterday</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tale-of-the-Princess-Kaguya/dp/B00PHSDS0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</a>), and with that combined with what I know about Mr. Miyazaki, it suddenly clicked for me:

Hayao Miyazaki is not some wiser-than-I'm-used-to clear-eyed critic of brain dead military condemning stupidity; he is (whether he quite realizes it or not) a proud supporter of Japanese Imperialism and a somewhat aggrieved comparator of ""liberty seeking"" military action between that of the modern United States and Imperial Japan,...

6155874,2,B00HE1EEQ4,"Oh I don't want to be writing this but...I didn't like the movie. I have all of the Studio Ghibli films and I held onto this one, unopened, for weeks knowing it would be the last time I would get to open a new Ghibli film...but oh dear.

On the surface the theory of the movie sounds interesting but it is just so boring. I don't mind films that focus on actions over dialogue but this movie really needed more dialogue to connect with the characters. There were too many ""dream"" sequences which to me ended up being repetitive and unnecessary. The jumping of timeline was another issue. It took me a while to realise this was based pre-war engagement on Japan's part. At one point I thought the movie had bypassed WW2 completely...but it hadn't. Years at the bottom would have helped immensely. Then there was the romance...or lack thereof...it was a missed opportunity as they met once for a bit and years later 'happen' to be at the same place and be madly in love, marry and...well I won't spoil it. The sister is another missed opportunity. Plus, there were too many characters who didn't seem to add to the story - except to muddy the water.

The animation is beautiful and why I managed 2 stars but honestly I will be putting this one next to Porco Rosco which I also didn't like. I say stick to Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Only Yesterday, Whisper of the Heart and From Up On Poppy Hill. All must better movies.",1468281600,2,1427,4.46360153256705
6155875,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I will try to write this review in 2 parts, with general info first, then spoiler info further down.

Firstly, having seen probably 7 other Studio Ghibli films, I was immediately familiar with the animation and audio style of these types of films.  You know you're watching a Ghibli film.  The way the story is told, often with less words being said, is always interesting to watch.  However, I must admit that this is not one of my favorites.  I say that because of 2 main reasons I can mention in this section.

Firstly, the story is very unexciting and undramatic.  It seems to mirror events that may have actually or could reasonably be believed to have happened in history, dating from the 1920s to the 1940s.  It basically follows the life of a Japanese aeronautical engineer, of which there is not a lot to get excited about.  A large portion of the movie is spent watching the protagonist, Jiro, drafting schematics, or eating food, which is a bit too ""Sims"" like for my taste.  On top of a boring career, the protagonist himself is a dull and boring character.  Unreasonably optimistic in every occasion, and far more altruistic than anyone I've ever met, both of which are extreme to the point of almost annoying.  Even his (very few) attempts at humor were delivered in the most boring, monotonous way possible.  He shows almost no emotion throughout the film.

Secondly, the time-skipping aspect can be slightly difficult to follow unless you are paying perfect attention.  I had to make sure to continually explain to my wife, who doesn't engage the same way I do in these types of films, or follow implied timelines the same as I do, that we had jumped ahead.  Especially since the animation of his face, grossly overly thick spectacles and all, did not really change from when he was a child (I say the lenses were obnoxiously thick, because of the one scene where he wakes up not wearing them, and the slightly blurry view that we saw did not suggest a prescription of that strength needed to correct it).  There are probably more than 5 instances in the film where time has been skipped, though you are never directly told that, the viewer has to figure it out for themselves using clues given, and their knowledge of history between WWI, the Great Depression, and WWII.

The following section will contain **SPOILERS**, so you've been warned.

There are some little things that frustrated me with this film.  For me, the greatest of them all was his relationship with Nahoko.  First of all, he barely knew this woman.  They had only one interaction which lasted a few hours when they were younger, and then NO CONTACT for SEVERAL years.  All of a sudden, they stay in the same hotel for a bit and they are madly in love and cant be without each other?  Considering the protagonist Jiro is the most unemotional character ever, we are to believe that he's so deep in love with this dying woman that he absolutely must marry her?  What. Ever.  And then that selfish, garbage move she pulls by disappearing to go off and die alone, WOW.

The fact that Jiro never actually meets the Italian designer in real life was illogical.  You mean to tell me he traveled all over the world per the demand of his employer, and he never went to Italy to talk to the man he's been sharing dreams with?  What. Ever.

Why were there so many plot lines that started but went nowhere?  The German guy who said the other German engineer needed Jiro's help because he was going against Hitler's plans?  Nothing came of that.  The Secret Police who were after Jiro for one day?  Nothing came of that.  The relationship with his younger sister?  Very weak, as she gets about 6 minutes of screen time, total.

The part where the earthquake hits Tokyo JUST as their train gets there?  What odds.  That whole scene where he promises to get the women home safely, blah blah blah, I thought WOW this is going to take a lot of work in the chaos.  Oh, no, sorry, they were actually bound for Tokyo, all of them, and they aren't really stranded at all, they are basically home, here, lets carry you 3 blocks, all done!

Then consider the macabre fact that these engineers want to build planes, but of course they are all government contracts and are solely used as war tools, to kill, and never return.  Great.

Final Thoughts:

I give this 3 stars because it's Ghibli and still has an artistic way of telling a story that beats a lot of other stuff out there.  But, this film is 2 hours worth of depressing events, one after the next.  There are a few instances in the film that make you feel warm inside, but the vast majority of the film is dull, and what's worse, depressing.  Aside from the dreams, you could say that that is how life goes, so at least it's relatively realistic.  But is that the sort of feeling we want to leave with after watching an animated film?  For me, the answer is no.  This is not a film I can recommend to anyone, and it would be a complete waste of time if you think your kids might want to watch it.  I can't imagine they would.

Of course, everything within is my own personal opinion.  You may have a different experience.",1466985600,5,5143,4.509740259740259

It was hard to follow and seemed to have very little development in both the characters and the plot. I found myself bored and distracted during the film which stunned me in retrospect. Miyazaki's films usually captivate and engage me through to the end.

The Wind Rises- although it contains wonderful messages and was beautifully crafted- was...just boring. For lack of better words, the spark or ""magic"" seemed missing from the entire film.

My suggestion- if you love the Miyazaki films then stick to his earlier works where magic flows out of the screen.",1465862400,,772,4.833333333333333

6155890,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Subtle, quiet, beautiful...  I'll confess up front that I think every one of Miyazaki's films is brilliant.  If you need lots of fantasy, or fast-paced relentless action, or sexy swashbuckling romance, or if you're a kid, or an adult with no interest in history, this perhaps won't move you.  If you haven't seen any of Miyazaki's movies yet, start with Totoro, Kiki, Howl, or Spirited Away...  I loved this film because it compliments and contrasts with his other work--it feels so personal.  And of course the animation and the music are stunning and magical.  But it's the fact that Miyazaki didn't just crank out another commercially reliable retread.  He never ceased evolving creatively, at a point in his life where many other artists play it safe--11 films, no misses, every film great in it's own way?  What other film director/writer/producer come close to that record?",1461283200,3,879,5.0137931034482754

6155894,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"A beautiful, poetic film that is a quiet tragedy: a balance between love and work. Full of the threat of war in the background, yet affirms life. ""You must live!"" says the film. Yet another masterpiece by Miyazaki, this one shows his creative process, and again his obsession with airplanes. Seemingly based on historical persons, he blends dreams with reality; sometimes we don't know if Giro is dreaming or if it is a real-life experience. Often he seems to share dreams with his hero/mentor Caprone, so the dreams seem more like he has stepped into another dimension shared by Caprone.
  The politics of the time in Japan and Germany is kept in the background, but occasionally manifests when the secret police look for Giro. However, why went after him is never explained as Giro seems to be a loyal citizen throughout, designing planes for the government.
  The film has a mature sadness about it, yet it is also dreamlike in the life and love of Giro -- his love for tubercular artist and his love for airplanes. He dreams of airplanes and these provide him with a sense of wonder and joy. Yet he is able to function in the real world as an engineer -- a brilliant designer -- who impresses his bosses with his genius. While an engineer, he also has the personality of a dreamy artist.
  One problem with the film is that it is difficult to know when he is in Japan or Germany. There were references to the Magic Mountain, and a German character singing in German, yet I believe they were in Japan at the time, near a sanitarium for TB patients. Yet other times Giro was clearly in Germany, trying to examine German planes.
  The earthquake of Tokyo portrayed in the film was interesting, especially showing how the ground heaved and how the train rode out the earthquake. The film was very human, though an animated cartoon, for it showed fully developed characters and gave glimpses of a wider civilization of Japan between the world wars, and how the people lived at that time.
  I have always loved Miyazaki's films, they have always been the most superlative of animated films, and while this was more grounded in historic Japan, it still had fantasy scenes. His films are always wonderful and a joy to watch, things of beauty.",1459641600,3,2238,4.657360406091371

6155896,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"An animated film, let alone any film, revolving around the engineering process is exceedingly rare, and this work was superbly well done. Delving into the creative thought processes and motivations of the protagonist, Jiro, designer of Japanese fighter aircraft during the Second World War, side steps all that is political by focusing on a single mantra: ""I just want to make beautiful planes"". And this story is told alongside some subplots that follow the personal side of the protagonist to an extent that demonstrates that as much as engineering might be the focus, there is more to life than engineering. As a software engineer, I can especially relate to Jiro as he ""gets in the zone"" to do his work, visualizing his work along the way. As a German, I appreciate that the storytellers concentrate on engineering, not afraid to explain the training that Jiro received from Germany during this time period. This film is highly recommended to anyone in a creative field, or anyone looking to gain some insight into creative fields such as engineering for career choice or appreciation for those who do this type of work for society.",1459382400,,1136,4.952879581151833

6155898,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"So far intended to be Hayao Miyazaki's grand finale(even though he has officially retired at least twice prior to this), The Wind Rises is a fusion of the life of aeronautics engineer Jiro Horikoshi and a book written by Tatsuo Hori titled The Wind Has Risen. It's not a straight up biopic about Hirokoshi as it adds several fictitious elements to the story. Miyazaki wrote and directed this, and is the latest from Studio Ghibli.

Jiro grows up a young man who dreams of flying, but him being nearsighted prevents him from being an ace pilot, so he instead embarks a career of being an airplane designer. Jiro is strongly influenced by famous engineer Giovanni Caproni, of whom Jiro converses with in his dreams, although whether this is actually going on inside somekind of magical shared dreamscape is left up to the viewer to figure out. He has a chance meeting with a young lady named Naoko during a colossal earthquake that he helps find her way home after their train was damaged. Jiro begins working for the Mitsubishi company(before they started being an international automobile manufacturer)creating aircrafts. He and his friend Kiro Honjo(who created the rejected Falcon plane)travel to Germany to learn how they design their planes, but the two get separated to work on separate projects. While on vacation, Jiro runs into Naoko again years later, and the two end up giving into fate and get engaged, all while Jiro gets his influence for what would become the Zero fighter. Naoka however is suffering from tuberculosis, so she and Jiro quickly get married to make the most of the time they have together. Jiro manages to see his Zero plane completed, despite Japan loosing WWII.

You can really see Miyazaki's love of flight in this movie more than in any of his previous works, and if you look close enough you'll see a cameo by the air pirates from Castie In The Sky. The movie does tend to blend fantasy and reality from time to time, and not just in the dream sequences. It's got the most impressive scenery and character animation from a Studio Ghibli film to date, while still being realistic and not giving too much into otherworldly imagery. The Disney dub is memorable with great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, Mae Whitman, and most especially Martin Short who steals the show in every one of his scenes. The original Japanese edition oddly enough has Hideaki Anno(the creator of Evangelion)as the main character Jiro, but still pulls off a great act. The Wind Rises has some of the most endearing and heartfelt moments ever seen in an animated feature, which may make it hard to sit through additional screenings without several boxes of tissue.",1458432000,,2689,4.856209150326797

6155914,2,B00HE1EEQ4,"I advise you to lower your expectations, if you hope to enjoy this movie. My admiration, even love, for this director began when I picked up a dirt-cheap VHS copy of My Neighbor Totoro at a video store closing. I watched the movie with my young children, and over the years, we saw almost every Miyazaki film. We were glad to see that Spirited Away, probably his finest, was shown on many screens in the US, and that Miyazaki finally received the honors he deserved.

So I had high expectations going into this disappointing movie. I wish it were better, and I wanted to like the film, but about all that can be said for it is that some of the scenes are beautiful, absolutely beautiful. But that isn't enough to carry the movie. The story is overlong, sad, and confusing. This is a biographical movie that needs more poetic license. The overall tone is somber, and the only ""fun"" scenes of airplanes with characters having a good time comes when the main character is asleep and dreaming. While awake, the main character spends a lot of time, just walking around, smoking. And I'm not one who likes only ""feelgood"" movies. Far from it.

I am hard of hearing. I'm far from deaf, and my hearing aids give me plenty of volume, but I have difficulty sorting out speech into intelligible words. So that I don't miss too much, I rely on subtitles. But I keep the sound up so that I can hear background noises, such as the sound of an engine. Unfortunately, In this movie, the subtitles do not match the dubbed English very well. So it was a distraction to see a subtitle such as ""cut it out"" and to hear the character say ""just be quiet."" I realize that the movie was translated from Japanese, but that's really no excuse. Given a production of this calibre, I would expect the subtitles to match the soundtrack, rather than being a different translation. At least for the hearing impaired, this distracts and detracts from the experience of watching the scenery, which is, (I'm sorry!) all the film really has to offer.",1454976000,,2015,4.548209366391185

I was hoping there would be more of a love story between him and his love. The animation was definitely beautiful.

6155926,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"In the waning days of World War I, Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a boy with an obsession with airplanes. However, he realizes he can never be a pilot due to his poor eyesight. Instead he decides to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Italian aeronautical engineer Giovanni Caproni (Stanley Tucci), and become an engineer himself designing airplanes. After finishing university and securing a job at Mitsubishi, he starts off on his career as Japan becomes more militaristic. Jiro is constantly searching for the more perfect plane design and also falls in a love with a young lady, Naoko Satomi (Emily Blunt), who he crosses lives with on a few occasions.

This movie is a mostly fictionalized biopic of the real Jiro Horikoshi. That being said, I thought this was an interesting story of one man's life as he tries to do his best during his young adult years and pursue his passion. As is usual for a Ghibli film, the animation was outstanding. The flying scenes and airplanes in this movie look great. Plus, there is some good music to go along with this as well. I would say that the only real issue with this film is that it feels too long as some parts seemed to drag on longer than necessary.

As bonus features, there are trailers and the original storyboards.

I would recommend this movie to those that like animation and the works of Studio Ghibli.",1451088000,,1370,4.676348547717843

6155941,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"I want to make sure about one thing. I think this is the director's choice. From the beginning, the director recorded this movie in mono sound and what you get will be mono. I presummed that it's because he wanted to let us feel like old movie. And I respect that.
About the film, I know some people are complaining about the story not being fantasy and all but for me the story being love story-meel dram was so so touching and the fact that this is Hayao's last film means a lot to me.
It is also related to the WW2 but it's just a matter of the background story. The most important thing was the relationship with this man who is a plane architect and the woman who is sick who enjoys drawing. The love story was so sad and beautiful that my heart was shievering a lot of times with beautiful feeling.
When the architect comes to the lady when he heard that she is ill, when the lady leaves because she no more wanted to show that she is ill.
Those moments are kind of old fashioned but also reminds me of that 1950 hollywood drama kind of feeling.
The music by Joe Hisaishi is never been better although we cannot hear it in stereo. It sustains, supports each moments and make it double the feeling of ours- almost make us cry.
The DVD versiion is clear and crisp. But some of the night scenes are kind of blury. But that was just a minor problem.
Mostly they are very clear- my dvd player is hdmi upscaled.

6155963,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I watched The Wind Rises on its first wide release day in the US. I had been looking forward to it for months. After finally viewing it, I must say that Miyazaki has stretched out his themes as far as they could go. The magic has worn out.

The movie is well-made, and has that familiar look and style we all know. But I wish it was more. The story struggled to stay involving for its length. Personally, the main problem with the film was Jiro. I just couldn't get into his character. The film spent a lot of time with Jiro and his obsession with airplanes, but it was hard for me to care or relate to him about it. Not much was brought into the rest of Jiro's world as well. For instance, the romance between Jiro and Naoko wasn't very believable. Naoko was an interesting character but, unfortunately, she was never fully developed into anything other than an occasional distraction to Jiro's preoccupation with planes. The passionless voice-acting did not help either.

Those who know Ghibli's catalog quite well know that Miyazaki's movies are thematic retreads of each other in some way. The Wind Rises is no different. Just like how Nausicaa and Mononoke are thematically similar, as are Kiki and Spirited Away, the themes in The Wind Rises have been done before in Porco Rosso and Howl's Moving Castle. Even so, Porco Rosso has a certain charm and mystique about flight that The Wind Rises couldn't even come close to capturing. The Wind Rises felt like a movie on autopilot (corny pun aside).

The best thing about the movie was its musical score; Jo Hisaishi returns for another stellar work. But other than that, The Wind Rises is just a well-done animated film and a decent, modest swansong to Miyazaki's illustrious career. As a longtime fan, though, I wish Miyazaki would've gone out with something more extraordinary or riskier. For a going-out film, it just wasn't very engaging and memorable.",1445817600,2,1909,4.709580838323354
6155964,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Cinemas master of animation makes a film that rivals any epic of spectacle and romance.  Miyazaki fills the screen with breathtaking moments of discoveries and observations.

Again, Oscar why did Frozen win over this masterpiece?! This is mammoth filmmaking with genuine feeling!",1445731200,,448,5.588235294117647

A beautiful and gently paced story that spends its time in character development and plot, all filled with beautiful realistic animation, not overdone eye candy action or tedious songs like the 'other' animation house.  this movie is the kind of stuff that makes Ghibli the best animation house anywhere, and the depth of film that Disney or Pixar can never compare to.  the story covers the early life of the real life famous aircraft designer Jiro Hirokoshi, the designer of the deadly WWII Zero fighter plane.  The film never gets to WWII - avoiding politics and controversy, it covers a boy's dream of becoming an aircraft designer till his dream is realized - the film ends with the first flight of the zero's predecessor, the Claude.  it is familiar ground for a Miyazaki film - and reflects his own life - the innocence of childhood, the power of dreams, the realization of your own childhood dreams complicated by the realities of life.  it is a complex story, dealing with, among other things, the futility of beauty created for a lost cause, with a (fictional) love story thrown in that - in typical japanese fashion, is delicately handled and in the end bittersweet and tragic.  Jiro is guided in dream sequences by a famous italian aircraft designer - caproni, and the imagination sequences dealing with esoteric engineering subjects like protuberance drag and flutter are deftly handled.  not a children's film - not because of 'content', but because it is art little kids won't understand or have the patience for.  sorry we won't see any more from Miyazaki, but glad he ended on such a high note.",1439251200,,1770,4.815181518151816

6156028,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I originally got this because I have been a huge fan of Miyazaki and the works of Studio Ghibli since I was a kid and wanted to expand my collection to include what is considered to be Miyazakis farewell masterpiece. Now, I understood before I got the movie that this was basically an animated documentary about the man (Jiro Horikoshi) who, through trial and tribulation, paved the way for the creation of many of Japans early modern airplanes, culminating in the Mitsubishi AM6 Zero. I was, however, somewhat disappointed with the movie overall; as I stated above, I have been watching Miyazaki my entire life and am accustomed to a certain amount of fantasy and excitement, so I don't deny I'm somewhat biased. However, I think it safe to say that this particular movie is quite drab in comparison to what we're used to.

Didn't feel the love between the main character and the girl he liked...at all. I often got confused as to where exactly the character was at certain points and where the scenes would take place on a timeline. The characters didn't share enough dialog to be able to tell these things. This movie does not have emotion and comes off as a bit too simplistic and dull in comparison to other Studio Ghibli films. The English voice acting is atrocious. It is unbearable, and I'm not sure if better voice acting would help these characters, who had very little substance.
On it's own, it is a beautifully animated film, but is lacking in almost every other cinematic element that should carry a film. Could have been so much better...",1435104000,,1074,4.748663101604278

6156058,2,B00HE1EEQ4,"My sister is into Japanese culture and a big Miyazaki fan, while I enjoy WWII history and film animation; this seemed like a perfect movie for us to see together. We went in pretty eager.
After a painfully long time, we both came out in a generally apathetic states.
It wasn't TERRIBLE. The animation was decent; it wasn't Disney (which is always a nice change), but the art didn't justify itself. Japanese animation is slower, so you need to show its beauty, and from the other Miyazaki I've seen, he CAN do this. He was telling a story about airplanes! There is so much potential for gorgeous flying shots and landscapes! Yet the art is generally unmemorable; I can't recall a single scene where I though 'Man. that is beautiful'...everything just seemed to meander along in mediocrity. 'The Secret Of Kells' managed to be slow paced and entertaining, based on the gorgeous stylistic design. I did not feel amazed as I watched this.
The story reads like a dramatic documentary, which seemed really odd to me considering the style it was shot in, as well as the caricature of a boss. Everyone else in the film is played straight, designed in a realistic style, and randomly there was this pipsqueak who was always shouting and looked completely out of place in the rest of the art. The script read like 'The Kings Speech', which could've worked, except that the actors they had for the dub (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, Martin Short, Stanley Tucci, Elijah Wood) could not seem to deliver the dialogue in any way that struck me as convincing. Part of it could be the fact that it is translated and dubbed, but in a film that seems to be banking on character development, it sorely needed an engaging sort of delivery. During the romance seen, I fell asleep in the theater after fidgeting a bit in boredom.
The topic that was covered was 'solved' in a way that would've been infuriating if the film was not so blandly uninteresting. Just because the man WANTED to build planes to simply fly does not mean that his Zeros were morally fine. You never seem him really struggle with the fact that his bombers are being used to impose his nation's will on others; you never even really seem him acknowledge it. He comes across as a pansy who builds planes for himself and never stops to think if he approves of how they're used. He's in Nazi Germany, and doesn't seem to care. As an American, I wouldn't have minded if he made the planes purely to destroy us; AT LEAST HE WOULD'VE HAD A MOTIVE THAT MADE SENSE. In the film, he comes across as lackluster, selfish, and immature, when I'm sure in real life he was probably an interesting man, but this film sells him incredibly short.
Studio Ghibli can make good war films: 'Grave of the Fireflies' was very good, nuanced, and covered difficult topics. This falls painfully flat. Maybe if you're SUPER into airplanes, or Miyazaki, or tuberculosis treatment in WWII era Japan you'll get a kick out of this, but in all other cases, I'd say pass.",1430438400,5,2991,4.62406015037594

6156064,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"As wonderfully executed, technically, like all of Ghibli's films, this film however, I found to be a weak note to end a career on. Especially one such as Miyazaki's. If you're a Miyazaki fan, you're sure to already have this in your collection (as I do) but this Miyazaki fan is left wanting so much more from the director.

This film is a hodge-podge blend of two things: the life and wartime work of Japanese engineer, Jiro Hirokoshi and a book called The Wind Has Risen, about a woman with tuberculosis. Two stories that really have almost nothing in common but homogenized together in a wholly fictitious recounting of this inventor's life. It's feels almost disrespectful and would feel so if it weren't so well made. It's like I made a movie about an man that I admire, Chuck Jones, and a book that I also admired, Wise Blood, and smashed the two things together and it isn't completely terrible. For the complete layman, it's like saying JFK was assassinated for being a mutant in Days of Future Past. Not that real-life figures can't dramatized for sake of film, but there is a line between a dramatized account of a person and a wholly fictionalized account of a real person. This movie is a clear example of the latter.

I guess that would sum up the movie for me. It isn't bad but there is something you feel while watching that makes you wonder its authenticity. You can clearly see Miyazaki's admiration for the man and the idealism he holds towards his work, but you also see his over-bearing influence on him, too. I read recently that Jiro Hirokoshi didn't smoke; in the movie, you can easily confuse him with a smokestack with how many times he lights up. This movie, in honesty, is more of a semi-biographical dramatization of Miyazaki, himself, and more possibly, his father. Both two men, and Jiro, who started off with a love of aviation and ultimately wound up following different paths because of this love and with their works used for completely different means. Miyazaki in animation, Miyazaki's father in owning a business supplying plane parts, and Jiro's work being used for war, respectively. ""Cursed dreams"" as Miyazaki calls them in the great companion documentary, The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, a film documenting a year inside Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki working on The Wind Rises

Incidentally, if you watch Dreams and Madness after The Wind Rises, you'll see the parallels of Miyazaki and what is ultimately put into his film. From his obvious love of classic aeronautics to his father. Miyazaki even states that while working on this film, he has ""rediscovered"" his father, and in a particularly touching scene towards the end of the documentary, he writes a letter recounting memories of his father during WWII.

All in all, I'm a little disappointed with the film, to say the least. Surely, one of his weaker films. Beyond its obvious fictitious nature (and partly because of it), it's unfocused and very sentimental; almost derivative of the most sentimental pictures of Capra, Ford, and Spielberg. It's about a man, his passion, then it's about war, and then love, and then it's ultimately about life? Despite how wildly imaginative and successful some parts are (airplane sound effects are done vocally, and playfully, reinstating the dream-like idealism of not only Jiro, but Miyazaki's, love for them), it's ultimately not entirely cohesive and left me wanting something more as a viewer and as a fan.

On the flip side, in Dreams and Madness, Miyazaki states he wants to do one more film and plans to work for 10 more years. One can only hope.",1429574400,2,3592,4.815235008103728

6156076,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Haiyao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have given the world some of the deepest and most beautiful films in the world of animation. Sadly, all good things will eventually come to an end. In 2013 this incredible creator announced that the time had come to put down the pad and pen and announce his retirement from making films. Still, you cannot do so without one final run. This time we get 'The Wind Rises', a fictional vision of one of the greatest minds in all of Japan as well as one of Miyazaki's childhood heros.

Jiro Horikoshi is best known for the creation of the Mitsubishi AM6 Zero, which was famously used by fighter pilots in World War II against The American Army. However, this is a much deeper story. It is the story of this man idolizing one of the greatest Italian aviation designers to full filling his dreams and at the same time meeting the love of his life. There are many historical events that take place during this film such as the great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, The Great Depression and the modernizing of Japan. Miyazaki brings his love of story telling, rich character development and of course his love of airplanes to his final piece and he does it in all the right ways. Especially towards the end when you see the relationship between Jiro and his love Nahoko. Miyazaki always knows how to bring the true connections of love to his animated creations.

While there is a great deal of right in this film it is not without flaws. I felt that this film dragged on just a bit too long and I also felt especially with the American voice casting, Joseph Gordon-Levitt didn't bring a great deal to Jiro's voice. Jiro is truly portrayed as a kind hearted and brilliant man. what amazed me was even though he knew that we was creating planes for the sake of war and destruction, it just didn't seem to take away from his work. He didn't come off as a person who wanted to win wars, but a man that just wanted to create airplanes. I just felt that more enthusiasm in his voice would have added an extra dimension to the character as a whole.

This is a wonderful send off for one of the greatest storytellers in animation. The bright colors and incredible fantasy like portraying of the Kanto Earthquake and of course all the dream sequences. 'The Wind Rises' is another Ghibli classic and one that will be held in such high regards as we say goodbye to a legendary figure in his craft.",1428105600,2,2405,4.473804100227791

He is inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer, Caproni. Jiro always dreams about him. Caproni is also a dreamer. Both meet in their dream kingdom. ""Japanese boy,"" Caproni says. ""airplanes are a beautiful dream. Engineers turn the dream into realty, and the sky swallows up those airplanes.""

Jiro has another dream: Nahoko, who was like a beautiful wind. She develops pneumonia and tries to get well in order to marry Jiro, who waits for her even for 100 years. They marry in a very romantic, unique, touchable and old-fashioned way that takes our breath away.

During World War II, Jiro makes Japanese pilots' dream airplanes, but none of them come back. The War ends. Jiro met Caproni again in their dream kingdom. Then Naholo waits for Jiro there. ""You must live!"" she says.

""The Wind Rises"" is Miyazaki's last animation. It is extraordinarily beautiful with his great imagination and his amazing excellent skills.
Jiro's dreams, Naholo's lovely and thoughtful expressions, and Caproni's wise and humorous manners make this animation amazingly entertainment. It brings tears to our eyes as we learn a traditionally and unforgettable moral.

It's got some fantastic animation, and lovely scenery as usual with Ghibli films, plus a fantastic story line to go with it. If you like planes and anime, you will like this movie, I swear to you. But...
it was really really sad and I just couldn't watch it without crying on multiple occasions. But don't watch it, this is a warning to you and your whole family. But if you're a man* like me and not afraid to cry, watch it. Just buy the movie anyway, because you'll treasure it your whole life.

This movie was absolutely BEAUTIFUL and poignant. Heart-warming and truly inspiring as far as films go. I felt for Jiro every step of the way--through his trials and tribulations, heartaches, and eventual losses.

But the characterizations were powerful and moving. They truly spoke of their commitment and dedication to their individual countries, cultures, and heritage. There was nothing bad that I could see that would give me reason to question things, but this movie made me appreciate history just a little bit more than usual.

6156107,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Of all of Miyazakis films, this one is my favorite. The hand-drawn illustration is, as you would expect, exquisite, the musical score gorgeous (I bought the CD), and the story, which is about a young man's love for a woman and for designing airplanes, is very touching. (At the Studio Ghibli staff's screening of the completed film,  Miyazaki said it was the only one of his films that made him cry.) The  title is from a line in Paul Valerys poem The Graveyard by the Sea. It is about how the poets depression while visiting a graveyard is overcome by the sight of the waves and the feel of the wind. Moved by them he says: The wind is rising, we must try to live. I promise that it will enhance your enjoyment of the film if before watching it you watch the special feature Behind the Microphones. Also, to fully appreciate the film, which Miyazki has said is for adults not children, you need a smidgen of historical background, which I supply here, lifted from John Tolands The Rising Sun.  About Japan: In the 1920s Japans population had grown much too large for its landmass to support, the government was rife with corruption, and there were protests by the hungry and the unemployed.  This led to the rise of nationalistic parties that combined socialism with imperialism. Their leaders saw gaining complete control of Manchuria, which was loosely governed by a Chinese war lord, as the answer to Japans problems. They would transform it from a wilderness into a civilized prosperous Japan, alleviating poverty and overpopulation at home. All this was happening at the same time fascist Italy and Germany were preparing for their own aggression.  Eventually Japanese military leaders, with a distorted Samurai-Bushido mentality, gained control of the Japanese government. And as we know, aggression, atrocities and tragedy followed. About the Zero fighter plane: It was fast, agile, and had considerable range, and at the beginning of World War II none of the other aircraft in the Pacific could touch it.  But the tables were turned when the US introduced higher performance fighters so that by 1944 the Zero was barely capable of competing with the enemy and was deployed as a kamikaze aircraft.",1425686400,7,2205,4.866666666666666

All I can say, is the artwork was wondrous in it's layers and depth. The screenplay was emotionally charged -  as found with 99% of his work.

6156119,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Yet another masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki and music creator Joe Hisaishi. This particular film is more mature than any other anime produced by Ghibli. It's more down to earth in every sense, less fantasy like, and the emotions are palpable. In this anime you're able to see Miyazaki's soft side explored at its full. As he said it in the documentary ""The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom-of-Dreams-and-Madness-English-Subtitled/dp/B00PEJ1948/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (English Subtitled)</a>, this reflects in part his father's character, and himself when he was a child surviving the horrors of the war. I would recommend seing the above mentioned documentary, as you will have a better notion of what the studio and the artist's went through to create this masterpiece. Suffice to mention this is the first film in which Miyazaki literally cries as he sees it on the screen for the first time. Truly touching.",1424822400,3,1031,5.8344370860927155

6156145,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"What a crowning achievement.  In this one film, the structure of animation, its purpose and possibility, have all jumped light years from where they were.  There are the obvious technical wonders--the scene where the young woman is painting and the animation of the colors on the palette, the way paint can seem like paint.  Simply amazing.  But more than that there is the slow crescendo of a country coming to terms with its last 150 years of history.  It's rootedness in isolation and in fear, in sorrow and in surpassing.  The scene of the earthquake, so much like the scenes surrounding Nagasaki and Hiroshima; the wrestling with the relationship to Germany and to war; the departure of the beloved to the sanitarium as she dies of tuberculosis.  How is one to deal with such things except through dreams, through a kind of process of self-animation through something that begins to approach the real obliquely, with a kind of evanescence.  Animation is no longer entertainment. It is working-through, therapy, the use of the imagination to walk towards responsibility.  Such a film cannot be made by a conquering power.  It is a film made by a culture that has wrestled both with power and with being conquered.  It is a culture that is emerging into something beyond the master-slave relationship.  Hence the relationship with Italy being foremost in the mind of the protagonist.

This movie has redeemed animation for social conscience, for historical development, for art.  All of Miyazaki's films are great.  This is by far the greatest.",1423008000,4,1547,4.98828125

6156150,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"The animation is astoundingly beautiful in this feature, and while it seems to move slowly with no real action shots or even scenes that show the bombings for which Jiros planes were designed and used, the film doesnt actually need them. It is a rare accomplishment in which employing the usual method of Show, don't tell would have actually resulted in a gaudy display of war scenes and fire that has been seen many times before and usually fails to grant the audience any real understanding of the situation. The world isn't all black and white and sometimes we must simply try to live.

The reason I cannot give this film 5 stars is because of a rather forced subplot of doomed love which not only fails to fit in with the rest of the film, but seems created only to add some kind of emotional impact. It is a shame that the same wisdom that kept the rest of the movie from becoming overdramatized was not employed in this aspect of the film.",1422835200,2,945,4.431034482758621

The story is two hours of an uninteresting person going to work.

There's no real action and no real adventure.  There's no mystery.  The story is flat.  There's no character development.  It's just a really bad movie.

6156194,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"This is a controversial story in a film made by the master of animation, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli.  It is imprtant to know that this is not a real biography.  Much of the story was made up for the film.  One can get the impression that it is a true story about the man who invented bombers for the Japanese government shortly before World War 2.  I gathered by looking online at the reviews written at the time it came out, that, though Miyazaki was a liberal, he was attacked for making this film.  The hero designed the plane that was eventually used to attack us at Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7th, 1941. The film emphasizes the ""hero's"" dream of designing beautiful planes, and never mentions the bombing of the USA.  This is also not a typical Miyazaki film.  Nevertheless, since I am a collector of his work, I am not sorry I bought this.

6156201,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Studio Ghibli gets serious in this romanticized take on avionic design at the dawn of the second world war. Engineering might seem a strange subject for animation, and at times it is, but in typical fashion the studio delights in writing their own rules and somehow coming out ahead. In the same way that recent big-budget live action cinema has been trying to draw inspiration from animation's more fantastical elements, it seems that The Wind Rises borrows its mundane, grounding elements from reality. Detail has always been a calling card for Miyazaki's efforts, and here the old master has again outdone himself. The screen is flooded with life, with even the least remarkable background extra, almost-inanimate object, or stunning, towering cloudscape enjoying an unusual amount of motion and character - notes clearly taken from live action. There's no shortage of the studio's usual breathtaking flights of fancy and wonder, either, but now they're tempered by that basis in reality. And, in a way, that makes them even more special. Dreams intertwine with lucidity so casually, it's tough to identify the moments of transition. The plot is less rigid than one might expect, too, strolling along at its own pace and lazily floating from one decade to the next. That makes it less gripping than the standard Ghibli effort, but we're invested in different ways. Gorgeous, poetic, relaxing, inspiring, warm and funny and bittersweet; it's not at all what I expected, and no competition for Totoro or Mononoke or Spirited Away, but it's not trying to be.",1420588800,2,1558,5.08984375

6156205,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"So much praise has already been said about the story, beautiful animation, music and style of Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece The Wind Rises, that it goes without saying that this truly is a high mark in his extensive career and a very fitting swan song if this is indeed his last film. While all this praise is well deserved, its the little subtle things that stood out the most.

The film unfolds like steady brush strokes of a master calligrapher. Each scene is calm, graceful, meaningful and with immense beauty. It has a slow deliberate pace, pulling you in and inviting you to savor every moment. The soundtrack is refreshingly quiet at times, allowing the ambient sounds and voices to draw you in even deeper. Intimacy is the precise word that comes to mind. Even the use of a 1.0 Mono soundtrack (DTS-HD 1.0 on Blu-ray) as chosen by Miyazaki is deliberate. A 5.1 soundtrack would have spread the sound field out. The 1.0 mix draws the viewer in closer to whats happening and to the spoken words. The film encourages you to contemplate what you are seeing and hearing, dares you to continue to follow your dreams, and to bravely love in an unconditional and honest way against the odds and obstacles.

There have been some negative comments (mostly in America) regarding the subtle voice acting of Hideaki Anno who plays the soft spoken but assured Jiro Horikoshi. But again, this was a deliberate choice by Miyazaki and is highly appropriate for the character, not just in the tonal quality of Hideaki Annos voice, but the way he delivers each line. Its actually jarring at first because the delivery is so different and unique, but soon the viewer finds himself attracted to this humble, contemplative, but so confident and assured character through his voice. Even when others try to get him to emote more feelings, like his sister Kayo and his friend and fellow engineer Kiro Honjo, he never waivers from his quiet confidence so perfectly portrayed by Anno.  All this steadiness of voice is finally broken when Hideaki Anno utters his last emotional words of thanks in the final dream sequence, quivering and breaking, pushing the viewer to tears of sorrow and joy.

This gentle, graceful assuredness is visually depicted with animation also, in the way Jiro renders aid to Naoko during the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, the courting and wedding scenes with Naoko, and finally the quiet moments of the couple spending time together as Naoko battles her illness.

There is a unique use of animation here visually. The drama is almost live action, well grounded and subtle, but the animation allows Miyazaki to fully realize the dream sequences in a fantastical way. This is a very mature work by a master film maker like a carefully choreographed last dance. If this is really Hayao Miyazakis last film, then what a gift of creative inspiration and insight he has given all of us.",1420416000,,2885,4.820202020202021
6156206,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"The first story in this film revolves around the real life person Jiro Horikoshi, the man responsible for creating what is probably the most known Japanese fighter plane (at least to Americans) - the Mitsubishi A6M - codename 'Reisen' or 'Zero' in English.  Horikoshi always lamented the death and destruction caused by his country in the years of World War 2 and his fighter plane's role (as stated in his two autobiographies).  Over 11,000 Zero's were built and sent into war and the vast majority were lost in battle (I think something like 20 were recovered post war... mostly emergency landings or partially intact crashes.)

Knowing this, I wondered what direction Miyazaki would take in this film: being his 'final' film.  Would he paint a nostalgic portrait of the pre-war years in Japan, or would he subtly criticize the military minded government of that era?  Well of course it is the latter, but with a light, glossy sheen of nostalgia leading into the loss of innocence.

What makes the film stand out is the repeated use of dream sequences.  Jiro sees the future of air warfare in his dreams and nightmares, usually accompanied by the great Italian aviation engineer, Count Giovanni Battista Caproni.  Jiro's dreams are the moments the reader gets to enter the character's mind and realize why he really strove to perfect his art.  Instead of his worries creeping into his waking life or work, they are subconscious and repressed.

The second tale is from a Japanese short story, 'Kaze Tachinu' or 'The Wind has Risen'.  I haven't read the short story, but it is about a sanitorium in Nagano, Japan in pre-war time.  Miyazaki added this fictional account to his film in the character of Naoko.  Of course, Jiro never really married a young woman with tuberculosis, but it adds a bit of depth to the story.

Looking back on the film and Miyazaki's life, I wonder if there was some parallel with Jiro's life and Miyazaki's?  Miyazaki himself has criticized anime, Japan, and the entire motion picture industry - so one wonders if he looks at Jiro as a sort of hero: also critical of his surroundings.

What it comes down to is the character Jiro loved airplanes and sought just to create what he felt to be the pinnacle of Japanese aircraft technology.  He didn't seem to dwell on the repercussions of his creation - in fact when other characters told him of the ultimate use of his planes, he brushed them off.  So don't expect a true to life biography of Jiro Horikoshi but instead a somewhat re-imagined story of his character with a lot of dream sequences and a fictional romance.  It is slow moving, but well paced.  It's not quite the imaginative story one expects from Miyazaki, but I feel it a fitting end to his legacy.",1420416000,4,2740,4.728421052631579
6156207,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"As expected, this film demonstrates Miyazaki's extraordinary talent for animation artistry. Generally, I think he is also a great storyteller; however as a story, the wind didn't rise...at least not for me and my family. Ideally, a story makes me want to hit the rewind button at the end and immediately start over. Such was definitely the case with Totoro, Spirited and Mononoke. Totoro left me wanting more so much that I immediately looked to see if Miyazaki/GHIBLI had done other Totoro works. Sadly, The Wind Rises didn't have the same effect. Instead of wanting an instant replay, this one had me feeling relieved when it ended. I watched with my wife and two kids who occasionally left the room to hit the fridge or take a bathroom break. At no time did anyone ask me to hit the pause button. When we watch this type of film, we often spend time afterwards discussing different characters and giving individual views on the story, the actors, the music, etc.. There was none of that with this film. I didn't even sit through the ending credits. Once the end appeared, I hit the stop button and we all silently headed to our own corners of the house. Again, the animation artistry in this film is supreme and on that note, this is a fine example of Miyazaki's work. Too bad the story wasn't very captivating.",1420329600,5,1314,4.643776824034335

6156221,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"After watching this movie in 2013 in a movie theater after my mother's death in 2012, I felt she would like this one the most of Hayao Miyazaki's  films! The story of Jiro who wants to design airplanes inspired by the italian aeronautautical designer Caprioni takes place in old Japan where my mother's family came from before living in America.

Jiro's dreams in which he met Caprioni and discusses designing airplanes, are surreal and beautifull and the film goes back and forth from Jiro's dreams to reality. An earthquake sequence is depicted dramatically in great detail and the violent upheaval of the backround art really shows that hand drawn animation is NOT an inferior medium to computer generated movies! The lovely hand painted backrounds and hand drawn characters are much warmer and appealing then the highly hyped Disney CGI releases such as FROZEN!

Jiro falls in love with a girl but she has Tuberculosis and dies! Jiro then faces life without her and in his dream Caprioni tells him that he must live and go on designing planes! Watching it again on dvd I feel all the more moved and this movie should be voted best animated feature but FROZEN will probably get it instead!

While Disney dubbs WIND RISES into english for american audiences, it does not promote the film nearly as much as it's own produced CGI films! Disney's hand drawn PRINCESS AND THE FROG was much more hyped then Wes Anderson's FANTASTIC MR. FOX but I'm glad I watched MR. FOX in theater and DVD while PRINCESS AND THE FROG clips look crappy and stupid!

The DVD extra, Behind the microphone shows the american actors praising the hand drawn animation and saying that,""We are so used to the perfection of cgi that it is TOO perfect and you can see the work that went into the hand drawn animation!

I have NO interest in watching Disney's hyped product! I wish my mother was still alive to see THE WIND RISES! She lived to 91 years old! It really shows how deeply powerful hand drawn animation can be!",1420156800,,1992,4.677142857142857

It is everything visually that you expect from a Ghibli film. The hand drawn character animation is simple but compelling and the background paintings are stunning. The film soundtrack is soaring and worthy of recognition in its own right.

But...the movie was BORING. I found the main character's journey of becoming the primary architect (spoiler!) of the Japanese Zero plane to be interesting but the pacing was off to me.  I wonder if this was because I didn't watch the subtitled version, but instead watched the dubbed version (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character did a fine job). I am not faulting his performance, far from it, but the material is tough to voice excitedly. The history of the movie is what drew me in, particularly the first half where Japan is obviously way behind the rest of the world with regard to flight design and with Jiro's expertise becomes literally a world power. However, for my taste, it was too slow. Clocking in at 2hrs+ I was visually stimulated but tired by the end. Quite honestly, I had to split the film into two sittings.

Jiro's personal life is touching although somehow for me not tear jerking...but you do believe that this man that led Japan into WW2 (whether he knew that or not) was a genuine person. Life wasn't fair to him with regard to his love, although he accepted and adored what he was given, but he was certainly a genius when it came to work. The movie humanized what could otherwise be easy to hate or misunderstand given the toll that the Zero had on US forces. I agree with the Rotten Tomatoes score of 89% fresh. This film is excellent, but not necessarily a film for everyone.

Grab a bottle of wine, light a fire, and sit back and let the movie draw you in. The charm is there and the visuals are great, but by Western standards it takes some effort to get through.

6156272,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Just watched Miyazaki's final film before his retirement, The Wind Rises. It is the historical story of Jiro Horikoshi designer of the first Japanese bomber plane, the zero, used in WW2. So I knew that this was not going to be fantasy adventure like Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle. But my favorite Miyazaki movie is Whisper of the Heart, which has only a few touches of fantasy so I figured I'd still like it.

I want to be clear it is a beautiful movie very worthy of Miyazaki's legacy and definitely worth watching, but it's not going to be what all Miyazaki fans expect or really love. As usual Joe Hisaishi made the soundtrack (like he has done for all of Miyazaki's films) but for the first time in my experience the soundtrack was to me rather forgettable unlike the symphonic masterpieces he normally makes like soundtrack for Princess Mononoke.

I also felt like the story was often rather dull, like the first hour or so. The romantic story was a beautiful addition, but really was only a small part of the last half of the movie. Some may draw parallels to Grave of the FIreflies (technically not a Miyazaki film but it was made by Studio Ghibli) in that it shows the horrors of war by destroying something that should be innocent and pure (childhood or Jiro's dream of designing beautiful aircraft). Personally I was much more touched by ""Grave of the Firefles"", it just had a much more complete story IMO. I will watch it again, especially to try and notice and appreciate the soundtrack, but this is the first time I have seen a Miyazaki film and wasn't instantly in love.",1418428800,,1592,4.582456140350877

6156277,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I was expecting something a bit more in lines with Miyazaki's more fantasy or sci-fi oriented productions, instead of a bio pic (an animated one too) of the man who created the legendary Zeke Japanese Zero.  It's quite lethargic through much of the film, with some interesting dream sequences.

There is much artistry in this film.  You can sit and marvel at the quality of story telling and drawings, and if you're a true Miyazaki fan you will love it for all its worth.  Still, I think even the most ardent Miyazaki supporter might get a little impatient with the flim's pacing.",1418256000,5,580,4.6568627450980395

This story is not only offensive, because it tries to glorify the main character's effort to manufacture war planes for the Japanese during WWII, but it is boring as well. There are no magical moments in this film like there are in Miyazaki's others. Even Whisper of the Heart was enchanting because of the two children's discovery of love for each other and From Up on Poppy Hill told a interesting story. The Wind Rises' characters are flat and I don't care about them. I am very disappointed, but that won't stop me from looking forward to any more Studio Ghibli releases.

6156282,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"WOW. Just beautiful. Great story for the whole family that's not silly princess stuff. Based on real people and real events of pre WWII Japan. Amazing storytelling. I sincerely hope this is not Miyazaki's last effort as he is unequaled in my eyes. If your sad to see Studio Ghibli go then check out ""Wolf Children"" or ""Summer Wars"". There's some great animators out there but ""The Wind Rises"" is a timeless farewell from the greatest storyteller of out time.",1418083200,,458,4.7375
6156283,2,B00HE1EEQ4,"We are fans of Miyazaki, but this movie is a disservice to his artistry and to history.  He briefly raises the question of using one's creative talents in the service of war, but glosses over this conflict in a very unsatisfactory way.  He references only the deaths of Zero pilots in a very abstract way at the end, rather than any of the other victim of Mitsubishi's war planes.  He fabricates much of the main character's life story, including his wife's illness, to garner sympathy for a creator of weapons of war.  There was great potential in telling this story, but it is largely left unexplored.",1417996800,8,603,4.660377358490566

6156286,3,B00HE1EEQ4,"I like every film Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed up to and including Howl's Moving Castle, after that his movies were just not as good. The Wind Rises is the best film he has done post Howl's Moving Castle but is know where near the quality (first anime is ever saw was Spirited Away great movie). There is not much to this story in fact I could tell you the whole story in three sentences or less. Scenes go on way to long, the love story seems tacked on, I was hoping that the movie would go into the life of some of the other characters like the German engineer and female lead character but the whole movie stays on one characters story. If the movie was not so long it would be more enjoyable, I like the animation it is top notch as always. If you are a fan of Miyazaki like I am you should see it, but if you are new to Anime you should start with some of his older works, I think if you start here you will become bored rather quickly. I would go into more detail but don't want to give away the movie for those who have not see it. This move is more of a should see for fans not a must own.",1417824000,3,1102,3.9684684684684686

6156289,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Just finished; along with Jeff H..  watching ""The Wind Rises"" by Studio Ghibli released by Touchstone Pictures.
While sadly, ""The Wind Rises"" is Hayao Miyazaki's swan song - his reputedly final movie in his disguished career; happily it's a brilliant and highly fictional biographical movie of Dr. Jiro Horikoshi - the aeronautical genius who designed the Japanese Zero fighter plane and perhaps of Miyazaki himself because it gives anyone who views it brilliant insights in the creative process that resides in all human beings.
Jiro steadfastly follows his childhood dream of building airplanes and flying them by exceeling in school and taking the extra step of learning English in order to translate, with help of a dictionary, articles about his hero, the famous Italian aeronautical designer Caproni.
In vivid dream sequences throughout his life, Jiro is mentored by Caproni, who sagely cautions Jiro at one point, that once a peak is reached, it can never be regained.
Now Miyazaki does take liberties with Jiro's real life story - but hey, Hollywood has a long tradition of fictionalized biographical movies.  For instance, the real-life Jiro suffered from a long and dehabiliting illness - not his wife, who dies from turberculious in ""The Wind Rises.""  They also had children - a fact not mentioned in this movie.
""The Wind Rises"" is simply a brillant visual movie that is a shining love song to the creative spirit that exists within each and everyone of us.

There is a scene in the animation about major earthquake in Kanto region of Japan.  In the animation it was nicely candy coated that japanese people peacefully helped each other through the hardship.  But the fact was that japanese people massacred over 6,000 Koreans and Chinese peacefully living in Japan in fear of them causing social disturbance.  So, this animation is full of misleading stories very offensive to the people who suffered under the Japanese empire.  It is truly shame that Mr. Miyazaki picked this weird story for his last animation.  Maybe it was a good thing that he retired after this movie.

For a man who seems so jaded in the essays that he writes, Hayao Miyazaki certainly knows how to make romance feel genuine. Some of the more quiet, reflective moments of the film reminded me of ""Porco Rosso"".

6156300,1,B00HE1EEQ4,"As an intense Miyazaki lover I have to say this film is a major disappointment in many ways. Miyazaki's idolatry of a weapon designer in a war of aggression and genocide Japan has yet to apologize for is gross. The white washing continues as Jiro visits the Luftwaffe and not a single swastika can be seen. There is some mention of people being pulled from their homes in Germany but they are not named. Miyazaki's unusually strong and amazing female characters are completely absent with Jiro's wife laying around sick and passive the entire movie while the boys have adventures.

Worst of all, though, is that this film is boring. It was hard for me to be offended by it as I was stiffing yawn after yawn. It's long and It's pointless. Jiro is just not an interesting guy and watching him struggle with one failed design after another offers little high drama. The only beauty in it is seeing prewar Japan in such preindustrial shambles - pulling Jiro's designs onto the tarmac with buffalo - and marveling at how they could become such an unbelievable power so quickly.",1416873600,17,1072,4.671957671957672

6156302,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"The long awaited Studio Ghibli English version animated film is worth it. While the story line is vastly different from any other feature from the studio, it is one that will stay with the viewer in mind and heart. Admittedly the director took a more conventional approach to this animated movie with flashbacks and dream sequences rather than the typical start to finish story-line, but; that actually is what transforms The Wind Rises to a status of its own. Our hero dreams of creating airplanes of beauty and speed to rival if not surpass his Italian role model... pre WWII. We are swept along in a saga of failures, frustrations, and mishaps as our Japanese hero come to grips with the country's poor economy and lack of expertise in technological arenas. As with any good movie worth watching, we have love come into the story and loss. Seeing the ""other side"" of entering the war, is perhaps the most challenging of all for most of us in the west who have been propadandized over decades since that war began and ended. Let therefore, you mind be open and your heart accepting!

The real thrust of the movie is essentially anti-war albeit cleverly concealed. Studio Ghibli espouses a more benign living upon the earth for us as humans, and oft reminds us that violence, destructive habits and waste are at our own peril. The artwork in The Wind Rises is a true testament to blending near reality with the finest of art in anime that cannot fail to engage the viewer at the very depth of his or her being. Watching The Wind Rises is not a one time event. It begs for repeat viewing and admiration of all its qualities and nuances.",1416787200,3,1636,4.602739726027397

6156305,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Anime master Hayao Miyazaki purportedly last film is a biopic on Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of several planes used by Japan during World War II. I quite like this unusual film, even though there is seemingly not much in the plot: our protagonist daydreams as a child of being a airplane designer, survives the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, enters as a young engineer the Mitsubishi airplane firm, goes to Germany to study the Junkers planes, returns to Japan and builds better and better planes that will be eventually used in World War II. (Miyazaki clearly loves WW2 era airplanes: they were already the subject of his previous ""Porco Rosso"", which I found a weak effort when I saw it some years ago).

Being a Miyazaki film, it would be redundant to dwell too much on the incredible artistry involved. While watching this, it dawn on me that even though engineering is very important and in facts permeates the modern world, there are very few movies (or novels or stage plays, for that matter) with an engineer as a protagonist. Part of this, I believe, is a culture clash between artists and engineers. I think engineers by temperament and personality tend to be responsible and well grounded, quite the opposite traits of bohemian artists, who tend to find them boring as well as social and political conformists. Unlike scientists, they are not even seen as eccentrics. In the artists' eyes, engineers are not good material either for heroes or villains.

Back to the film, perhaps the only important flaw in the movie is that it becomes so defensive at the end on the fact that his planes were used in a war. Well, of course, they were, as did the planes of other countries in the conflict.

Summing up, this is not probably the very best film of Miyazaki, but it is very well worth watching.",1416614400,2,1795,4.710191082802548

6156313,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"I've always been a huge fan of Miyazaki ever since I first saw KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, but for his supposed swan song, I honestly don't know what to think.  Perhaps because of this, I cannot rate it as highly as his other films.  Don't get me wrong, THE WIND RISES is not a bad film at all.  It's as colorful and beautifully animated as any Ghibli movie, and of course Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime.  There are also moments that truly do recall Miyazaki at his most imaginative.  But if you're expecting another movie filled with action, wonders, and magic as his other movies, you will probably be disappointed, because THE WIND RISES is as far removed from the rest of Miyazaki's output than even his less fantasy-oriented pictures.  Rather than aiming for the exuberant joy and wonders of LAPUTA, TOTORO, the dark, epic spectacles of MONONOKE, NAUSICAA, and even the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, this movie is mostly down to earth, with only the occasional moments of pure spectacle.  It's also his most ""adult"" film to date; perhaps because of this, THE WIND RISES is also cursed with the misfortune of being Miyazaki's least accessible film.

Although financially successful in Japan, THE WIND RISES has not been without its share of detractors, particularly Miyazaki's target audience.  Controversially, the protagonist of this story is Jiro Horikoshi, the man who was responsible for creating some of deadliest airplane bombers during World War II.  In fact, this film is very loosely based on his account.  Naturally, one would expect that Horikoshi would be portrayed as a tyrant considering the outcome of his crafts.  But in a rather daring and almost controversial move, Miyazaki presents the man as a gentle, ambitious soul who simply wants to achieve his dream of flying rather than as a psychopath bent on destruction.

Speaking of dreams, the most memorable sequences in the movie are those which involve Jiro's fantasies of being airborne.  In one such scene, an extensive, dialogue-free prologue which opens the film, we see young Jiro wake up from his countryside home, climb to the roof and board an elaborately customized craft, soaring across the Japanese countryside to the strains of Joe Hisaishi's typically melodic score.  This sequence comes to a crashing end when a massive zeppelin and shadowy blob monsters straight out of HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE and SPIRITED AWAY descend upon the boy and render him unconscious.  Otherwise, the rest of the ""dream"" scenes (which are interspersed throughout the languidly paced story) feature Jiro interacting with the charismatic Italian aircraft designer Caproni.  ""Airplanes are beautiful dreams,"" intones the air designer to the short-sighted Jiro who he refers to as ""Japanese boy"", ""Engineers turn dreams into reality.""

Otherwise, the remainder of THE WIND RISES follows Jiro as he grows from a not-so passive school boy who spends time reading books by his hero into an adult who becomes an aircraft designer instead of a pilot due to short-sightedness.  This is a forty-year cycle of a journey that unfolds in over two hours.  Regrettably, this is also one of the film's biggest shortcomings:  not only are the scenes involving Jiro's growth less intriguing than his flights of fancy, they slow the movie's momentum to a snail's pace.  Miyazaki is no stranger to producing movies that push over the two hour mark, but THE WIND RISES feels even longer than that, with most of the scenes being slow, drawn-out conversations between Jiro and his colleagues.

Aside from the aforementioned ""imagination"" bits, the only other major highlight of THE WIND RISES happens about a third of the way through in which an earthquake literally tears through Japan and causes a passing train to derail and crash spectacularly.  This is arguably my favorite moment of the movie because it showcases Miyazaki at his most visceral.  The execution of the tragedy is powerfully conveyed through the dramatic staging and animation.  Aurally, this scene is impressive as well; rather than the natural sounds of earth rumbling and winds, Miyazaki instead chooses to employ a wordless, monotonous ""chorus"" of voices to substitute for both.  The effect adds an emotional, organic layer to the scene, especially when we witness the tragic aftermath of the tremor.

Also intriguing is the sequence where Jiro and his friend Honjo travel to Germany.  Not only does Miyazaki treat us to splendid tours of the aerial wonders of these massive ""war machines"", we get to see the characters speak German.  Much later on at a hotel, Jiro meets Castorp, a German-accented defect who eerily denounces Hitler and, perhaps rather ominously, predicts the downfall of Japan.

Alas, such moments are tragically undercut by the film's much more languid second half, which shoehorns a tragic love story involving a gentle painter woman whose internal clock is ticking.  I don't know if it is just me, but neither Jiro nor his lover Naoko come across as particularly compelling characters, and perhaps because of this, we are given little reason to care about them.  A ""courting"" scene in which Jiro attempts to fly a paper airplane to Naoko's balcony is inspiring, but sadly that's about as interesting as this love story gets.

More detrimental, unfortunately, is the dub by Disney, which is surprisingly disappointing considering I've always loved the studio's English work for Ghibli's films, the performance I found to be the weakest being that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Now in all fairness, Joseph is not eccentrically cast, but I just didn't find him compelling as Jiro; to me he sounded like he was giving a stiff, monotonous performance, which is disappointing considering that many of the leads in Disney's other dubs (eccentrically cast or not) have done well.  I don't know it's just me or if it's the style of the character, but either way, this is, I'm sorry to say, the dullest performance in any Disney dub I've ever listened to.  The Japanese version, meanwhile, casts Miyazaki's former protege Hideaki Anno in the role -- rather eccentrically.  His turn is similarly dull.  I don't know what Miyazaki's intention was with the voicing of this character, but it just didn't work for me in either language.  To be fair to the other cast members of the dub, though, Emily Blunt fares a little better as Naoko, but the love scenes between her and Levitt are shockingly ineffective:  however much emotion Blunt gives, Levitt's distressingly wooden performance sadly nullifies any bit of chemistry between the two.  Too bad, because with better voice direction the love story could have been less draggy than it comes across as.

One actor I was particularly looking forward to hearing was Mandy Patinkin, having enjoyed his rollicking turn as a pirate in the controversial but still grossly underrated CASTLE IN THE SKY dub.  Sadly, his turn here is nowhere nearly as entertaining; his role is just to be a down-to-earth boss with zero comic timing.  He more or less plays it well, but I was still disappointed, considering his previous work.  The rest of the actors also consist of names such as Darren Criss, Elijah Wood, and DIRTY DANCING's Jennifer Grey, but to be honest, they didn't really stand out to me all that much, and their parts are so scanty that one wonders why they were cast at all.  One would think that more experienced voice actors would take the job instead (the first Ghibli dubs had a much better balance of that).

Even though I consider this to be the worst of the Disney-Ghibli dubs (NOTE:  by that I do not mean it is an outright BAD dub; it's not, it's just average, at least to my ears compared to their others), there were three performances I truly did enjoy.  Martin Short plays Jiro's curmudgeonly cantankerous, ""short"" sized boss, Kurokawa with gusto and humor, breathing a lot of much needed zest into the dub.  This is the sort of charismatic, interesting type of character audiences should expect from an animated production, Ghibli or otherwise, and Short effortlessly steals every scene he's in.  Just as good is Mae Whitman as Jiro's sister, Kayo.  Again, being blessed with a great role to begin with, she provides a lot of spunk and energy to the role and makes her arguably more sympathetic than her dull brother.  The great Werner Herzog also gets to have a lot of fun as the German-accented Castorp, especially when he sinks a drunken brawl in a lively tavern scene.  Finally, Stanley Tucci is TERRIFIC as Caproni, providing the character with charisma and a charm which is impossible to dislike.  The Italian accent he provides is very appropriate as well.  On that note, the use of accents for the different characters is also a plus, as is the use of children from the opening scenes.  If anything, these assets prove that even an inferior Disney Ghibli effort can still have its share of saving graces.  Otherwise, however, it's just not my favorite of the Disney-Ghibli dubs.

Perhaps another major problem I have is the ending; while the fate of the love story isn't hard to guess, but Miyazaki instead chooses to close the film with yet another dream sequence.  Instead of coming across as a genuine conclusion, this last scene feels strangely unresolved.  What happens to Jiro after the scene?  What became of his career?  Sadly, the movie doesn't answer any of these questions, and as such, the denouement doesn't feel like a genuine conclusion.  It's almost as if Miyazaki ran out of creative juice and decided to stop his movie on an uneasy note.  PONYO was especially guilty with this practice, and it's unfortunate that the same is true here as well.  Even MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, PRINCESS MONONOKE, and PORCO ROSSO, abruptly as they ended, had a sort of genuine resolution that this lacks.

Still, take my complaints with a grain of salt and go see THE WIND RISES.  Even if it is by no means Miyazaki's best film, the moments that truly excel really show that a genius such as Miyazaki never ceases to amaze, whether at his most vigorous or his most down to earth.  On a final note, it's a shame that this will be Miyazaki's last film; the man has left behind a legacy of richly animated treasures that many have not taken notice of at first but are gradually finding audiences.  He will be missed.",1416096000,6,10317,4.926547137073453

6156318,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"It's instructive that the great Japanese animator-director's(Miyazaki) `last film',""The Wind Rises"", his attempt to capture the metaphor of flight as self-determination based on our thirst for spontaneity and freedom,is a fictional biography of Horikoshi Jiro, the chief engineer of many of the fighter planes that launched the Pacific War. It's his most realist film. There's an emphasis on the poverty and instability of 1920s and 30s Japan. The country is depicted as so pre-modern it uses oxen to pull new aeroplane prototypes from the factory to the landing field. There arequotes from the Paul Valery poem,The Graveyard by the Sea:""The wind is rising/We must try to live!""Although it offers a few critical words for Japanese aggression_""Invade Manchuria,set up a puppet government...Make the world your enemy...forget it.""It doesn't make a full account of Japan's entry into the 2nd World War. Instead we get engineer Caproni's advice to Jiro : ""remember this,Japanese boy. Airplanes are not tools for war. They are not for making money. Airplanes are beautiful dreams."".Planes,both agree,are destined to become machines for slaughter and destruction-but neither would undo their work. In 1956 the real Horikoshi said in his war diaries(1956):..""the majority of us who had truly understood the awesome industrial strength of the U.S. never really believed that Japan would win this war...I blame the military hierarchy and the blind politicians for dragging Japan into this hellish cauldron of defeat.""

Miyazaki's compromised protagonist has incurred criticism and controversy,not least in the context of Japan's right-wing nationalism,and the country's long historical absence of a state apology. The film deals more with the dream of flying rather than the curse:less Icarus,than Pandora. People hoped this left-wing film-maker would help Japanese people move on slightly from the war. There has always been an aversion in Japan to discussing that conflict. Miyazaki has been criticized for failing to ask why Japan went into the war,instead to romanticise the making and flight of that aircraft, and the guy who designed it. It seems a lost opportunity. Instead we get the Thomas Mann magic mountain hotel for TB sufferers,where Japan can forget the invasion of Manchuria,that Japan has seceded from the League of Nations,that Japan and Germany are about to blow themselves up. Miyazaki shows poor little Japan beingpatronised by the Germans,threatened by the Americans. The narrative has been so embedded that this war was thrust on Japan from outside,we did our best. But it's not that Japan was a backward country, so it can't be using that as an excuse for the war. The events of the war, it's suggested, were thrust on Japan like a tidal wave(nature and history fusing).The film Godzilla, was the atom bomb made flesh. The Japanese had ambivalence about science and technology,and were seen by themselves as losing the war to American science. Enola Gay made the Japanese realise how far behind they were. Anime and Manga need to deliver bolder strokes in future. In Valery's poem,the salt wind is already rising to break up the tranquil roof of the sea,and to dash it aganst the rocks. The immobile noonday will no longer exist,no longer tranquil or noon,the poet is the single blemish,the single change,as the wind comes up to lash the sea,giving way to a sudden gust of utterance,the poem itself.

6156326,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"Anyone familiar with Miyazaki's work would be able to guess that this is his last film, even without his announcement. While it is a fictionalized account of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, an actual Japanese aircraft designer between the wars, it is also in many ways a sentimental autobiography of Miyazaki himself. Note especially the sequences in which we see the bespectacled, chain-smoking designer's hands engaged in putting pencil-marks on paper -- the very thing Miyazaki has been doing for decades, laying out hundreds of thousands of individual animation cels.

Here in 'the West,' many film critics and moviegoers still automatically assume that 'animated' means 'for children.' Animation developed from completely different traditions in Japan, and has always been a medium for storytelling of all kinds. 'Princess Mononoke' (which Miyazaki also made expecting it to be his last film) may not be appropriate for children, and 'The Wind Rises' is basically a melodrama that only adults will fully appreciate.

The essential theme of the film is how the works of great artists are appropriated in ways that the artist does not intend. Who is responsible for the results of that appropriation? Is such appropriation inevitable? In Jiro Horikoshi's case, his elegant aircraft designs were ultimately the Mitsubishi A5M and A6M Zero-sen fighter planes that helped Japan establish a vast empire in the late 30s and early 40s - an empire that destroyed millions of lives, and led to the utter destruction of Japan. In Miyazaki's case, this film has been used by Japanese nationalists (who labeled it 'anti-Japanese' and denounced Miyazaki as a 'traitor') to rally support for amending Japan's anti-militarist constitution -- but this film has also been denounced as 'right-wing' and insufficiently apologetic for the war by critics and commentators in South Korea, the US, and elsewhere.

At some point, Horikoshi knew that what he was building was an engine of destruction. At some point, Miyazaki knew that his film would open wounds and become ammunition in an ideological war. Should they have stopped creating?

A specific criticism that has been leveled against the film is that Horikoshi seems unaffected by the destruction his planes cause. I think these critics look at 'cause and effect' in an overly mechanical 'Western' way. Without spoiling anything, I have to ask if they failed to notice whose blood is vividly spilled, and how that eventually plays out in Horikoshi's life. Note that the storyline involving the blood is the major fictional element added to Horikoshi's biography by Miyazaki.

The film is beautiful to look at, Miyazaki's trademark representations of grass, water, clouds, and flight all more splendid than ever. This film has many scenes of people just sitting in rooms, talking, drawing, smoking (there is a lot of smoking in this period piece), and the interiors are as lovingly lit as the exteriors. The way in which the themes are carried through the visuals, which include a number of dreams and premonitory flashes, rewards repeat viewings.

Another gift to humanity from possibly the greatest animator who has ever lived.",1408665600,68,3164,5.218503937007874
6156327,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"""Airplanes are not tools for war. They are not for making money. Airplanes are beautiful dreams."" ------- Count Caproni

I watched Princess Mononoke at a theater in Tokyo in 1997. It was the first time for me to see a Studio Ghibli production in a big screen. Having seen the studio's earlier works on VHS by renting them, I was already a big fan of Studio Ghibli, but for a reason I can hardly explain, it had never occurred to me that watching at a theater one animation feature that the studio, which has become a household name in Japan, produces and eagerly wait for the next to come out in about two year intervals would be extraordinary experiences in my life. Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind (1984) directed by Hayao Miyazaki totally changed my perspective of animation movies, although Studio Ghibli had not been founded at the time of the production. Miyazaki's first hit movie created so big a buzz in Japan that it even reached  me, who was more a person that likes anything interesting to himself, movies, music, art, and whatever, than an ""anime"" lover. Miyazaki's long time colleague, Isao Takahata's productions were also impressive, including Grave of the Fireflies (1988) and Only Yesterday (1991) which also contributed to set the standard of Studio Ghibli that its fans can expect.

My long quest, however, seemed to have begun when I saw Princess Mononoke. The yearning for the experience that I should have had if I had realized that I was missing golden opportunities to have a great time as a movie-goer; I want to watch ones like Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, or Grave of the Fireflies at a theater. To me, Princess Mononoke and later productions lacked the great appeal that made me a Studio Ghibli fan. I would say that even Spirited Away was a little disappointment. I saw some of these multiple times in a big screen, trying to find the very magic I loved so much that I cried even when I saw it on the TV screen, but to no avail. It seemed that the studio lost something very important to me in return for the commercial successes that were brought about by intense promotion through media and the tie-up with Disney.

The poor showing in the box office of experimental My Neighbor Yamadas that was released in 1999 after Princess Mononoke was said to have prevented director Isao Takahata from working on his next project. Having waited for as many as 16 years, I almost gave up on Studio Ghibli, although I think that Secret World of Arietty is a little nice piece. Then what are supposed to be the two master directors' last animated theatrical features were released in 2013 across Japan. My feelings were ambivalent.

Trying very hard not to expose myself to the flood of advertisement and to get prepared for the last chance, I went to watch Wind Rises. Miyazaki's swan song turned out to be way beyond what I had long been expecting for. I was captivated from the opening sequence of protagonist Jiro Horikoshi's dream; from the beginning to the end, every frame is heartbreakingly beautiful to me. By the final scene, where Jiro meets Count Caproni again in a dream, I was shedding tears.

""What about your ten years in the sun? Did you live them well?"" ----- Count Caproni
""Yes. Things fell apart toward the end, though."" ""Not a single one returned."" ---- Jiro Horikoshi

Finally, it is there. It had been so elusive that it deeply shook my heart like a stunningly magnificent piece of music. My eyes were misted even after I came home. Miyazaki is brilliant in his direction to let the futileness of war stand out, by not directly depicting war itself or even the fighter plane that made Jiro Horikoshi well known as its designer. To this effect, his directing is so much poetic as comparable to what Isao Takahata did in his signature Grave of the Fireflies. This is a matured Miyazaki. Animation is also stunning; I think that it is hand-drawn cell animation at the finest just as Isao Takahata's last work Tale of Princess Kaguya is, but each in a different way. Because there is no place to add this at the moment, I would like to mention here that Takahata's experiment in My Neighbor Yamadas blossoms in the brush painting look of animation achieved in his final production, which reportedly took eight years to make.

At last, I would like to thank both Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata for saving their best for last. Your works are truly worth waiting for!",1408665600,3,4417,4.646606914212548
6156328,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"What is there left to say that hasn't been said of this movie? For those who haven't watched it, Pixar's Up is notable for its opening scenes that beautifully expresses the emotional heft the main character will carry for the rest of the movie. It's wistful, heartbreaking, and can compete with any 5 minutes of any other film - animated or not - as the most touching ever put onscreen. In almost typical Miyazaki fashion, the entirety of The Wind Rises achieves that same affect and poignancy.

With that said, it will bring feelings out of you, simply put! That's not to say it's a depressing movie, but it's emotionally fulfilling on a level few animated films have been able to express (and to be honest, those few films are mostly Miyazaki films). As you watch the life of a Japanese man building aircrafts for his country and finding love, The Wind Rises does carry a somber tone due to the plain fact that this is Miyazaki's supposed last film. Rather than describing the plot in countless words, it's pivotal to just watch a Miyazaki movie - going into too much detail would spoil the experience of watching a Miyazaki movie! Expect the same childlike imagination and artistry you may have seen in any of his previous films, especially if you get the chance to purchase the Blu-Ray copy.

Personally, I agree with the common notion that this movie was made for adults, but it's not because there's any outlandish content (as a small note, the plot is historically set during a time in Japan as it prepares for WWII, but no war violence is shown). Like Pixar's Up, the main character - whose eyesight relegates him to engineering airplanes rather than flying them - hoists some hardships that aren't explicitly discussed for the audience. Even compared to live-action movies, people should know that there's very little being spoon-fed to them. Limited exposition appears in the dialogue, and the steady pace of the film will most likely bore kids. For that matter, the nostalgic build of The Wind Rises is just not suited for antsy children.

For adults, however, this movie is simply beautiful, and a must-watch to break any premature expectations of an animated film. It won't give you any gimmicks in its storytelling or its many inspiring moments. It's that element of pure, genuine filmmaking that makes Miyazaki films so timeless. Of course, variations of that praise have been said of his works many times before. What's plainly left to say is to just watch it while you can. It just so happens that every aspect of the film reminds you that nothing lasts forever. But some types of nothing can feel endlessly great.",1408579200,151,2631,4.765350877192983

  * Jir Horikoshi is our main character; we follow him from childhood, see how he is inspired to design airplanes by reading about an Italian aeronautical designer, then we see his engineering studies and his demanding employment at Mitsubishi. (We also see some of the failures.)
  * Caprioni is the Italian designer. (He has wild dreams and a large family!)
  Honj is Jir's friend and fellow employee at Mitsubishi. It is so satisfying to see two honorable gentlemen treat each other with respect.
  * Nahoko Satomi is the lovely (doomed) young woman our hero loves. Her illness was another aspect of the film that escaped the youngsters in the audience.
  * Kayo Horikoshi is our hero's sister; she was one of my favorites because she was in a perpetual snit, which masked her loving heart.

We also have an impatient boss, a Swiss acquaintance, parents, military fellows (both Japanese and German), landladies and various other characters. (Miyazaki creates delicious characters whose movements are authentic and breathtakingly real.)

To me, however, the main reason to watch this Oscar-nominated film (Best Animated Feature) is to admire the exquisite art work. Every frame deserves to be mounted on a wall somewhere. There is nothing quite like Hayao Miyazaki's meticulous artistry, whether he is writing the story, drawing the frames or directing the movie, he is one of a kind. His previous works include ""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""

This is PG-13; it includes no profanity, nudity, warfare or gunfights. We see the Great Kanto Earthquake which occurred in 1923, but again, no blood or horror. It includes a tuberculosis epidemic, but we mostly see patients wrapped snugly at a sanitorium. We also see heavy cigarette smoking because pretty much everyone smoked in the 30s and 40s, so that is a non-issue.

The film is a multilevel love story. The lesser, but still heartbreakingly powerful, is between two young people in the time between the Great Kanto Earthquake and the beginning of WWII, The greater story is of a dreamer and how he brings forth his dream, the essence of who he is, as much as the world will let him in the time he lives in.

Any engineer, or anyone who has collected a paycheck while pretending to be one, should see this film.

With this film, Miyazaki once again confirms his place among the great dream shapers. Like Heinlein, it isn't so much that he says what to aim for, but to take what's in front of you and bring the wonder of it that you can see out into the world for the rest of us.

There is no greater animated filmmaker in the world than him--even counting the Pixar bunch--and one wants more. My wife and I just saw The Wind Rises.

It unfolds at a glacial pace and even its fictionalized account of the great Japanese aircraft designer's personal life--with its emotional drama--did not move me in the least. The made-up romance was sickly sweet and transparently tearjerking--a love story uncomfortably like Love Story. The moral and ethical ramifications of Jiro's work were given only perfunctory attention. I never felt Jiro wrestling with what his beautiful machines might do (and did).

Miyazaki is known as not only a gifted director, but also the guy who has the old-good, traditional Japanese spirit and ideology, like that men should work hard and women should take care of their husbands. He overlapped his own life on the fighter developer's life to question the modern way of life, since Japanese people already forgot such an old-good spirit.

This message is not so obviously claimed though, may be difficult for the people who are neither familiar with his unique personality nor current Japanese trends to comprehend his message properly.",1399766400,4,724,5.232758620689655
6156333,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"I got introduced to Hayao Miyazaki with 'Spirited Away' then worked my way back to his earlier works. This is reportedly his last film. The story revolves around Jiro Horikoshi, the real life designer of Japanese war planes from WW II. The movie is slower paced than your typical frenetically paced American made animated film. The Japanese, unlike Americans, do not consider animation to be in the exclusive domain of children's entertainment (our loss). In this regard I don't believe it will hold the attention of children under 10. There's no talking animals or friendly aliens- it's a serious drama. I took my two teenage sons to see this. Having grown up on a steady diet of slick, fast paced Disney/Pixar animated films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, WALL-E they found this an interesting change of pace.

The film, though slower paced, engages you with elaborately detailed animation(hand drawn)and the passionate and likable Jiro. We are introduced to Jiro as a young boy who is obsessed with airplanes. In beautiful dream sequences he meets his hero, Caproni, an Italian airplane designer. Watching Jiro on screen as he grows into manhood I realized that he exhibited characteristics we hope all our young men will aspire to - integrity, selflessness, honor, respect and empathy for others as well as an always respectful attitude towards women. And it's his love interest where the second half of the film will take us. And Jiro will stay committed to her despite the obstacles.

As for the issue of military aggression by the Japanese, Jiro believed, some might say naively believed, that his airplane designs would be used only for defensive purposes, not as part of an arsenal of offensive weapons meant to intimidate and conquer other nations. As you'll see, Miyazaki, like most contemporary Japanese, has no nostaglia for the era when it's leaders took Japan into a self-destructive campaign of military expansion- in one scene you'll see the ambitous military generals depicted as aggressive and idiotic buffoons.

Yes, he worked with the government and military as many of present engineers do while their creations are used to destroy lives.  Is it ethically flawless to ignore this fact in order to have good lives or in the name of one's passion or thirst for knowledge?

Living it, breathing it, ensuring with each passing moment you strive towards it's completion. In a time of impending destruction, a dreamer, Jiro Horikoshi, faces the impending doom with the everlasting energy of creation. His passion manifests into the construction of airplanes, a literal representation to symbolize his drive to soar above any limits he has. From each period of growth, he learns of love, music, and shows everyone the limitless capacity of the artistic mind, and how it must be appreciated. I couldn't recommend this film well enough.

P.S. Before I saw this movie, there was talk that it was praising the War and how Jiro aided destruction. However, the movie itself criticizes war, and advocates strongly against it. As Caproni says to a young Jiro, ""...Airplanes are not tools for war, they are not for making money. Airplanes are beautiful dreams, engineers turn dreams into reality."" When the greed of man beckons relentlessly for destruction, there must always be those who create. Two sides of the same coin, operating in ways they always have, even before civilization's first breath, fighting for supremacy in the hearts of man. The majority of people are selfish, and choose the destructive path. It is only the few who see it for it really is, and pursue a life filled with vigorously pushing man's creative limits for the benefit of those who will follow.",1394928000,5,1474,5.040983606557377
6156339,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"I watched the movie a couple of days ago in both Japanese with English subtitles and the dubbed version. Having lived in Japan as an American for many years, I'm fluent in the language, but even if I weren't, I'd have a strong preference for the language it was created for. Must say, though, the actors for the dubbed English version did a fantastic job.

The movie is loosely based on the life of Jiro Horikoshi, best known as the chief designer of the Zero, the new fighter used in the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. It was the best fighter of its time, with twice the range of what we Americans had, considerably superior maneuverability, a wider field of vision than previous Japanese planes, and better trained pilots, too. Those were just some of its good points, although likely the top four. For this reason I would have liked to have seen some scenes of dogfights, or at least the Japanese carrying out their practice dogfights showing off what the plane could do against other planes of the time.

But, the movie is a work of fiction only loosely based on Horikoshi, and ever since being defeated in WWII the Japanese are strongly and vocally committed to peace. Any movie that appears to glorify war comes in for strong criticism from among their ranks. Americans, too, may not be thrilled about seeing  American planes and pilots back in 1941 and early 1942 getting thoroughly thrashed.

Of course Horikoshi designed the plane to be successful in combat against anything actual and potential enemies had, the movie's take on designing beautiful planes being his chief motive notwithstanding. He started work on the Zero a few years before Japan went to war with the U.S., at a time when sensible Japanese were hoping to avoid war with the U.S. and the other Western powers. The plane was introduced in July 1940, before the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. One doesn't have to condone war to enjoy seeing what the fabled Zero and its well-trained pilot can do in a dogfight, particularly as those are highly relevant historical facts. Since there was little of that, the movie gets 4 stars instead of 5.

In fact, Jiro suggested dropping weapons from the airplane while he struggled to create the lighter airplane.

6156345,4,B00HE1EEQ4,"First, the movie is beautifully done. I doubt Miyazaki could make an ugly movie if he tried. The animation meets the very high standards we've come to expect of Studio Ghibli. Also, the imagery seems much more approachable than in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B000065K6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>. I love those, and I love the rich references to Japanese traditional culture in them - but I don't understand even a quarter of those references, assuming I recognize them at all. The Wind Rises, while wholly Japanese, seems to offer fewer mysterious icons than those others.

Then, throughout, the movie maintains a sense of wonder in the magic of flight, a theme that recurs throughout Miyazaki's work. And, in a Nerd Pride step that I enjoyed, he presented the engineers who create the aircraft as the workers of that magic - not the pilots who flew them, but the flying machines' creators. All this comes across in a fairly peaceful and non-threatening environment, so even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B002QRCBW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>&nbsp;seems fierce and fearsome by comparison. If you have kids, that might matter.

My problem, though, is that wartime Japan was hardly the Eden this movie seems to portray, and the warplanes created here wrought terrible destruction on all the Japanese fronts of WWII. Perhaps this was meant to be seen as if through the eyes of a child, unaware of those hard, adult truths - I have no way to know. In any case, I came away with the impression of having seen half of something, where the darker half had been carefully excised.

8631836,5,B00HE1EEQ4,"Reportedly Miyazaki's final film, this may be his only one not appropriate for children.  Based loosely on the life of Japanese aircraft engineer Jiro Horikoshi, it explores the complex relationship between aircraft as beautiful art objects, and their use as machines of terrible destruction.  As an American, I can afford a sense of detachment from the reality of Japanese atrocities during the war, that isn't available to people in other Asian countries who saw this film as glossing over some truly horrific abuses.  Miyazaki takes care to show how Japan wasn't entirely in league with Nazi Germany; the contempt the German engineers have for their Japanese counterparts is a major source of irritation for the main characters.  Jiro is a fervent admirer of the aircraft designer Hugo Junkers; Nazi ideology is irrelevant to him.  He may want Japan to succeed, but what he really wants is the opportunity to design beautiful airplanes and watch them fly.

It's important to not hold Japan to an overly-severe standard in this area; it's an unavoidable fact that the major impetus for aircraft design and manufacturing since the beginning has been governments building them as weapons of war.  In one of several dream sequences where Jiro encounters his ""mentor,"" the Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Caproni (who he never met in real life), this observation is an inescapable source of regret.  Caproni expresses his dream that one day, when the war is over, he can create the airplane he really wants to build - a passenger transport dedicated to purely peaceful purposes.  In another dream sequence, Jiro sees the beautiful Zeros flying off to unload their deadly cargo, and how ""none of them returned.""  The real Jiro Horikoshi was strongly opposed to Japan's entry into what he felt was a futile war; this isn't apparent from the film, which presents the character as obsessed with the beauty of aircraft, while almost oblivious to their purpose.  We do get glimpses of another side of the war, where Jiro witnesses a Jew escaping from Nazi pursuers, and encounters a German man at a resort who opposes the Nazi regime.

Miyazaki demonstrates his mastery of animation in several sequences, notably an earthquake during Jiro's time as a student, where he meets (or encounters for the second time) Naoko Satomi, a young woman he eventually marries (the actual earthquake happened in 1944, much later when  Jiro would have already been working for Mitsubishi).  The sequences with Jiro and Naoko have been criticized as unnecessary; I found them to be vital in humanizing Jiro, who without them would have come across as inhumanly obsessed with little more than his work.  They also humanize his gruff boss (voiced in the English-language version by Martin Short), who stops cracking the whip for a moment and reluctantly allows Jiro and Naoko to stay in his home.  The boss character, by the way, is drawn as such an over-the-top caricature that it makes Mickey Rooney's ""Mr. Yunioshi"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breakfast-at-Tiffany-s/dp/B000HX499S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a>&nbsp;look like a model of political correctness.

The strongest criticism of the film is that the atrocities of the war may happen off-screen, but aren't exactly alluded to, either - someone watching this film who was ignorant of the Second World War wouldn't learn much about them here.  It's almost as if the film was made for the ages, that we're as distant from these events as we are to Ancient Rome, where we have the luxury of viewing the conflict objectively as something from the distant past.  World War Two has entered the culture as the ultimate conflict between good and evil, and Miyazaki may not have inserted enough anti-war, anti-Nazi details to make the film palatable in the same way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Das-Boot/dp/B00BZAYZ82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Das Boot</a>&nbsp;was, where the submarine crew were shown as suitably contemptuous of the regime on whose behalf they were fighting.  The contempt the characters have for Japan is more for it's being ""ten years behind"" in engineering, and for using oxen to pull aircraft from hanger to runway.  The conclusion may be more ambiguous than many viewers would prefer, where the incongruity of aircraft as beautiful machines of destruction is never fully resolved.",1532131200,,4453,5.37841726618705

I watched it when it first came out five years ago. Bored me to tears and the romance pissed me off. I decided to give it another chance recently, hoping that I was just remembering it wrong, but it still bored me to tears and the romance pissed me off.

Jiro spends more time dreaming than awake. Maybe if we spent more time in his waking world, we'd be able to actually develop a connection to him and his love interest (who, let's be honest, he meets at like, eleven or twelve, meets again five or so years later, and is suddenly deeply infatuated with her, going so far as to ask her father for her hand in marriage when they'd only had three proper conversations, one being the one they'd had with her as a child.) This movie is just so. boring. There is no plot aside from the romance (which, I hope you already know my thoughts on that). The tone of this movie is all over the place, sometimes wanting to be an exciting action flick and sometimes wanting to be a really bad romance and sometimes wanting to be a slice of life story.

This movie is supposed to be a biography of Miyazaki's friend Jiro Hirosaki, but the parts that pissed me off the most were the ones that weren't even accurate to the real life person. You know that when the love interest has a lung hemorrhage onscreen and it's unclear whether or not she'll die and you're rooting for her to just kick the flipping bucket already, you've got a horrible movie.
