5963863,3,B00F2K00EO,"Indian films have always had a certain degree of titillation in them, many of mainstream Indian films always have one raunchy and erotic song number that objectifies women and focussed primarily on her curves and sexuality.
Erotic films have had a niche market and they are targeted mostly to the bored and uneducated who go for some mindless entertainment. However there are very few films that have eroticism as the  sub plot but yet have a story to tell. B.A. Pass is one of these films.

BA pass is about Mukesh ( Shadab Kamal), who is sent to stay with his aunt after the death of his parents. He has to work as a help in the house and gets verbally abused by everyone in her household.  It does suck when you lose both your parents at an early age. Our boy suffers as he does not have the means to start out on his own- i.e. getting his own place. On a chore for his aunt he meets Sarika ( Shilpa Shukla) who seduces him. Mukesh and Sarika become part time lovers because Sarika is still married to an abusive husband. There is a scene in which her husband forces himself on her- very bold by Indian film standards.
Ok, so coming back to the story- Sarika is not just a lonely woman- in fact she is a very devious femme who has other plans for Mukesh.
Mukesh becomes her partner in crime but all good things must come to an end.
At only 100 minutes, things are brisk paced but the movie was just too depressing for me. It comes with a disclaimer that the story imitates what happens in society.
I think this was an average  movie, the erotic components, and the real characters reflect the authenticity that the story required. Depressing movie are just not my thing anymore and I avoid them at all costs. However, reality is well portrayed and if that is your things- you might like this one.",1406160000,2,1799,4.361194029850746
5963864,4,B00F2K00EO,"very good story line and very good acting by all. Story is about a innocent guy gets trapped and becomes a male prostitute due to a few bad choices. climax is realistic. there is a lot of nudity for a hindi movie, and though there is no full frontal nudity, lead actors are half naked for most part. Shilpa Shukla looks hot and the sex scenes are very cold and forced as they should be, as per the story. Dont miss this movie.",1390348800,2,426,4.144578313253012

5963867,2,B00F2K00EO,This movie seemed to try to follow the erotic thriller drama formula but fell short in some areas to deliver a more powerful impact. It was slightly entertaining but no Basic Instinct.,1461628800,,184,4.78125
5963868,5,B00F2K00EO,"A very dark, disturbing, and high impact movie that deals with complex societal issues. The cast performed extremely well and by the end of the movie the harsh themes covered impact you and you are forced to think about the issues - youngsters helpless after the demise of both parents, greedy and selfish relatives, people who befriend you to exploit you, idle rich who have no qualms to exploit a college student, spousal abuse & brutality of supposedly educated individuals, and the general depravity under a veneer of modernity.
An excellent movie for a social studies class.",1461283200,,579,4.979381443298969

5963871,3,B00F2K00EO,"A sad tale told well. It is one slice of life in a sea of pride, vanity, corruption, poverty, inhumanity, and the abuse of women and children by those who can. The hero is no hero. The villainess is no villain. It's the Indian version of ""Chinatown"". If you want to see a little of India outside the tourist views and down to the nitty gritty of ordinary life, then this is one peek into that world. The storytelling is more intimate and less sweeping than a Slumdog Millionaire. The production values seem cheaper, but add to the sense of intimacy. I recommend it if you are inclined to see one version of reality as opposed to escapist fantasy and an open or inquiring mind about life in India.",1453248000,,696,4.403100775193798

5963873,3,B00F2K00EO,This movie is just adult fun. It's not a common in most Hindi movies. The married woman had sex with BA student. The young age student could not tell between good and evil. It's not real boring.,1444262400,,194,4.27027027027027

8611718,3,B00F2K00EO,"Bollywood movies are the most uplifting that I know. Why does Amazon choose the oldest and darkest movies to show? This movie haunted me for a long time and not in a good way. Please Amazon Prime does Jab We Met and Dil Dhadakne Do and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham mean anything for Prime viewers. I know some are old, but please more Shahid Kapoor &  SRK please!

8611719,4,B00F2K00EO,"I liked this movie. This feels like a relatively honest portrayal of a hard scrabble life, but it is a little depressing. This isn't typical Bollywood fare. There isn't any singing or dancing. It's more like a well produced foreign film. The movie is about a young man that has lost both of his parents and turns to prostitution to make his way in the world. It does not go very well for him. I watch Bollywood films and world films. This has very good production values for this type of film.",1472169600,,493,4.369565217391305
8611720,1,B00F2K00EO,"I watched it only for the first fifteen minutes. I don't understand why the movie makers of this day focus and depict aberrant, pathological people in the society and even glamorise them. Poorly enacted and slow to begin with, I wish I could give it zero stars. No, I don't want to waste time to see the full movie and judge. If a movie doesn't keep me engaged during the first fifteen minutes, I can't give it a good rating.",1466812800,,425,4.325
