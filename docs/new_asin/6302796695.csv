513645,5,6302796695,"When I was editing a magazine, the only review I ever regretted publishing was of this film: I watched it only hours before the deadline and my review was based on my immediate impressions, when this is a film that really needs time to sink in. Partially it's because there is so much information thrown at the audience but also because it's one of those films that doesn't wear its humanity on its sleeve, and it takes a while for its full effect to really permeate.

The film's structure is shifting and driven by events rather than character - it begins with roadblocks and house-to-house searches before the discovery of the body of an American 'aid' worker (a quietly impressive Yves Montand in a complete reversal of his role in Z), then moves back from his funeral to his kidnapping, the gradual realisation from the press that he was rather more important than that and only some half an hour into the film introduces him as a character through a series of interrogations. Hopes are raised and dashed, the corruption of a dictatorship masquerading as a democracy is briefly threatened with exposure, American foreign policy motives debated (aid agencies being an excellent way of discovery the weaknesses of Latin American countries) and gradually the futility of the kidnapping and the inevitable murder become apparent as both kidnappers and victim come to realise that he is worth more to the government dead than alive.

All of this is played out with a number of memorable scenes (not least Montand's realisation that he is going to be killed in the film's most human moment, all the more so for being played with cold logic), some black humour (the taxi driver who has had his cab expropriated by terrorist before and knows the drill, the police childishly giving each other electric shocks with torture equipment or the businessman ignoring an escaped bound-and-gagged kidnap victim on his way to work) and a great eye for details (the too-expensive watch on a vegetable seller revealing him as a secret policeman). While the film lacks the immediacy of Z and the emotion of Missing, Costa-Gavras brings an overwhelming sense of impotence to the actions of both sides and adopts an interesting visual approach in the many scenes shot from rooftops looking down on the police and army about their dirty work, constantly panning and backtracking to reveal new details in every corner, giving a sense of omnipresent chaos and subjugation. It's genuinely impressive stuff, and it's also intriguing to note the film's location - it was shot in Chile not long before the violent US-backed Allende coup. Maybe it's that familiarity with the locale that makes Costa-Gavras' later Missing seem so authentic.

On a historical note, this was the film that George Stevens Jr. and Charlton Heston successfully banned, initially from opening the Kennedy Center but eventually, such was the fallout, from US cinemas (it premiered on TV instead). The reason given was that the film 'encouraged acts of terrorism,' something which is patently absurd - the film very clearly and unequivocally reaches the conclusion that the torturer's murder is a backward and counterproductive step. It seems all the more hypocritical considering the Kennedy family's own financial and political support for terrorist groups such as the IRA, not to mention the large number of pro-IRA films (and even, in the 80s, pro Taliban and Al Quedah films) that have played the same venue without any protest from Messrs Stevens or Heston.",1261353600,8,3511,4.998290598290598
513646,5,6302796695,"The film ""State of Siege"" by Costa Gavras is as relevant today as the day it first came out. This film is a retelling of foreign Governments violent take over South American countries in the late 60s and early 70s. Much of these facts ca also be found in the book The Condor Years: How Pinochet and His Allies Brought Terrorism to Three Continents by John Dinges. A must see thriller that reveals the struggle in Latin America by a group of individuals who named themselves after Tupac Amaru the Great Inca Guerilla warrior who fought against the Spanish to free Peru. The Tupamaros history is well represented in this film but you won't find a DVD or reasonable priced copy of it in the US for various political reasons.

513647,5,6302796695,"Costas-Gravas'1973 film STATE OF SIEGE suffers from one overwhelming defect: it was produced before the most damning evidence against Mitrione came to light.  But then, the Tupameros who kidnapped and ultimately executed him also lacked that evidence, as did the author of the best book concerning him in English, A.J. Langguth's HIDDEN TERRORS- at least until it was ready to go to press in 1978.  Langguth notes the difference between the real Mitrione and the character who represents him in the film, Santore, played by Yves Montand.  ""Montand was slim and continental; he smoked cigarettes.  Mitrione was midwestern and corpulent; he had puffed, occasionally, on cigars.  He also criticizes Costas-Gravas for ""including every undocumented rumor about Mitrione in the film,"" which is indeed one of the film's weaknesses, for being undocumented, the crimes of Mitrione are not presented very convincingly or linked directly to him.  But Langguth is unjust in blaming Costas-Gravas on this score, because the filmmakers did not know, any more than had Langguth himself when he originally wrote his book, that the most damning accusation was true.
  When one reads Langguth's account of the interrogation of Mitrione by a member of the Tumpameros, which takes up all of Chapter 9 of his book, one is struck by the incredibly naive, young and gullible nature of these people.  Far from being the organized urban guerillas they are portrayed as being in the film, they come across in this account almost as flower children.  They were woefully unprepared.  The interrogator, although he spoke English and had lived in the US, was not even able to correctly pronounce the word ""torture"", which after all was the matter at issue, and had to rely upon Mitrione to help him out!  One wonders how these people could have gotten up the courage to execute Mitrione after the Uruguayan government refused (at Nixon's insistence) to release 150 political prisoners in exchange for his life.  But then, they seem to have been a bit confused concerning their goals.  Freeing 150 prisoners would only have helped those 150-- it would not have solved the problem of US-supported repression in Latin America.
  So how should the Tupameros have gone about solving that problem?  First of all, they should have prepared the case against Mitrione more carefully, so that instead of the amiable chat related in Langguth's book, their interrogation would have been hard-hitting.  Along with Mitrione, they should have captured a US journalist, not intending to harm him or her, as a witness.  The interrogator should have come in with all the evidence he or she could gather about Mitrione, and with the goal of discrediting him, and thus US policy.  He should have collected a number of Mitrione's victims, as well as-- if it had only been possible-- one other, all-important person, with evidence which  constituted the ""smoking gun"".  These should at first have been kept out of sight, in an adjacent room.  The interrogator should have read the accusations against him, and then the accusers would be brought in, one by one.  As it would no doubt be painful for the ones who had been tortured to recount their experiences in Mitrione's presence, they would have been asked to write their testimony ahead of time and simply read it. Then Mitrione would be given a chance to confirm or deny the charges. Even if he denied them, the sight of his victims and their accounts would have been damning.
  And then the Tupameros should have led in their star witness, a Cuban named Manual Hevia Coscuelluela.  Mitrione would have known this man as a CIA agent, allowed him in on his torture ""classes"", and confided his true feelings to him.  What he would not have known was that Hevia was actually working for Castro-- he was a double agent. In 1978 he published PASSAPORTE 11133: OCHO ANOS CON LA CIA,  which is not available in English translation.  Despite the author's undeniable political bias, two reputable Americans-- the journalist Lannguth and the scholar Alfred W. McCoy, author of A QUESTION OF TORTURE: CIA METHODS OF INTERROGATION FROM THE COLD WAR TO THE WAR ON TERROR,  have accepted his account as authentic.  Furthermore, it is supported by the testimony of the former Uruguayan Chief of Police Intelligence, Alejandro Otrero, who was no Communist.  It was the CIA who had trained Mitrione, although he was not officially working for the Agency, and this methods were straight out of the 1963 KUBARK MANUAL OF INTERROGATION.  Hevia should have looked Mitrione and asked, ""Senor Mitrione, do you remember me?""
  Confused, not fully realizing where Hevia's real sympathies lay, Mitrione would probably have answered ""Yes"".
  ""I attended your class on interrogation did I not?  Did you not personally expound to me your views on the 'art' of interrogation?""  MItrione would hardly have been able to deny it.  And then, right there on camera, with the American journalist taking notes, Hevia would have begun his account of these experiences.  ""Your torture demonstration utilized four Uruguayan beggars, one of them a woman, who had committed no crime but were merely swept off the street to suit your purposes.  You used them to demonstrate the effects of different voltages on different parts of the human body, and a drug which causes vomiting.  They all died.  You tortured them to death, Seor Mitrione.  And then later, you related to me your philosopy of interrogation, which involved torture and beatings-- before, during and after the interrogation-- not to obtain information which could save lives but to punish those who dared to criticize the government.  Proudly you told me, 'In my profession, I'm the best.'  You called your 'profession' interrogation.  I think most of the civilized world would have called it simply 'torture'.""
  After this film was shown around the world, and the journalist's report was published, I think that even if Nixon had continued to oppose the exchange of 150 prisoners for Mitrione's life, and Mitrione had been executed as he in fact was, the president would have felt it politically unwise to send the commemorative wreathe that he did when Mitrione's body was brought home to Indiana for burial.",1197763200,18,6235,5.034146341463415
513648,5,6302796695,"As another reviewer noted, this is an important film, one based on fact.  It shows a ""traffic expert"", played by Yves Montland, going to a South American country to ""assist"" in traffic, but in reality, he is a CIA operative specialising in torture squads, trained by the US.  He is kidnapped and held for ransom by leftist factions, the government refuses to negotiate with them, and he ends up getting killed.  There is a scene where operatives torture live subjects on stage in front of the South American's military.  It's an extraordinarily difficult scene to watch, but it is very powerful and is not done for shock value.  The film is a bitter condemnation of American involvement in Latin America.  It shows that the US government (and quite a lot of other governments...the French did this in Algeria) tortures people, so the Abu Ghraib scandal wasn't that surprising.  The film isn't as good as Z, Costa-Gavras's first political film, but it's definitely worth watching and searching out.",1173744000,2,997,4.934131736526946

This video makes it clear that torture has been a commonplace practice in US foreign policy.  This movie tells the story of how Dan Mitrione (he's given another name in the film) was sent to Uruguay to teach the police of the Uruguayan dictatorship to torture ""leftist radicals.""  According to some testimonies, in order to teach his techniques, he used homeless indigents as guinea pigs and tortured them to death.  He was captured by the Tupamaro (a left-wing guerrilla group) and finally executed when the government refused to make the group's demands.  The movie was filmed in Chile a year before the Pinochet coup.  It is in French and was not widely circulated in the U.S. (for clearly evident reasons).",1166054400,14,870,4.924657534246576

513651,4,6302796695,"This 1973 film is set in Uruguay.  There's a revolution going on.  An American, played by Yves Montand, had been kidnapped and murdered by the Tupamaro guerillas.  What follows is a flashback on the seven days leading up to this.  Mostly, it focuses on the American's interrogation.  Gradually, the audience learns that he has been sent there by the American government to teach torture to the Uruguayan police.
Directed by Costa-Gavras, the tone of the film is that of a thriller, with broad sweeps of action and cross cutting between characters.  There's very little historical base for all this, just the immediacy of the moment-by-moment tension.  The filmmaker clearly favors the guerillas and their attempt to topple their corrupt government.  But the story is less about these political ideas than an attack on American imperialism and complicity with the government.
Viewed from the 2002 perspective, the question of whether these guerillas are terrorists or freedom fighters surfaces.  They've targeted their actions towards a particular person who they know is responsible for heinous deeds, not the general public.  But yet they have a political agenda that they are trying to push through violent means.  Certainly, the film makes the viewer think seriously about this.
The film is too long.  And it's in French with English subtitles even though it takes place in South America where people speak Spanish.  Yves Montand is a fine actor and plays his role well.  He keeps his composure throughout, even though he was aware of the sensitive situation he was in.  For me, this challenged the film's authenticity, as did the French language.  I therefore found it impossible to be emotionally moved by his plight.  The message therefore, which must have been shocking to 1973 audiences, was an unmasking of the United States' complicity with dictatorships in Latin America.
Despite its flaws, I'm glad this film exists.  It brings something important to the public.  It certainly piqued my interest in Latin America.  Personally, I'm always surprised when people are so shocked about government misdeeds.  Americans are idealists.  We've been brought up to believe in freedom and democracy.  Problem is we thought that achieving these goals were easy.  There're not

513652,5,6302796695,"This is an unbelievable film which takes place during the Uruguayan military dictatorship of the 1970's.  Specifically, the storyline depicts the actions of Dan Mitrione, a US torture specialist sent to Uruguay to train police and military personnel.  Inevitably, it leads to his murder by the Tupamaros (left-wing freedom-fighters).  The film is moving and stuns the viewer with the cold harsh reality of what really happened in Uruguay.  In fact, the Uruguayan regime banned this film because it exposed the true face of the dictatoriship.
I highly recommed this film.  It was especially moving to me because it gave me a clearer perspective of what my family went through during this atrocious period in Uruguayan history.

513696,5,6302796695,"In State of Siege, Costa-Gavras repeats the success of Z in delivering an indictment of those who arrogate power to themselves, while at the same time preserving the dramatic rhythms of the film, so that our interest never slackens.
Given that his sympathies are clearly against the torturers, and his emotions with the 'Tupamaros' he does a good job of maintaining ambiguity with regard to the moral positions on both sides. He keeps the truth about the CIA agent in a state of evolution, so he is not damned as a monster, at first; and he does not flinch from the fact that the revolutionaries killed as part of their programme of attack.
True, the 'Tupamaros' are mostly young, intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, while their Government and military opponents lack charm. But then the moral values justify that distinction. And the CIA agent has considerable charm and appeal, even if in, the end, the very nature of what he does condemns him all the more given the supposedly superior moral environment from which he comes.
It comes as a shock to see the torture lessons being given in a lecture theatre in this now quite classic film, even after all we have learned of the ways in which humans, even under the leadership of various US presidents, even doctors, have persuaded themselves that it's OK to torture others.

513697,5,6302796695,"Born in 1968 here, so had not much idea of the backdrop of this film, really, minus knowledge
and education (to some minor degree, really I had to educate myself much later) on the history
of revolution, politics and torture death squads etc. etc. ad nauseum in countries like Chile,
Uruguay, Brazil, and such going back to the 60s and 70s, and the US involvement in same.
This was a gripping two hours and scarifying, eye-opening history lesson for me, to say the least.

I read up on the July-August 1970 Mitrione case of course, after viewing, to get informed on the facts of the actual
events and persons involved.  State of Siege, I believe, is a near-perfect, near-documentary/reportage-style
masterpiece, fraut with tension even in its slowest moments, none of it really seems to drag,
Montand is fabulous, and so is everyone else in the film.  Not an easy film to sit through, it's
rough stuff, as well it should be.

I'm glad I did, however, since firstly this new, long-overdue (for decades)
Criterion DVD release not only does this important film justice, but watching it cements yet another
""missing"" (conveniently) history lesson that's denied to our brainwashed peoples: no less so than
the terrified leftists and students of places like Uraguay and Chile and et al. in the 50s-70s and onwards.
Watch this and learn, folks. An eye for an eye, a spy for an eye.....And what did it gain us? As usual,
NOTHING. ZERO.  Anyway, though, I think the point here is that nobody wins: the fascists never win
through terror and torture, and the leftists don't win through kidnappings, bombings, torture, and
extortion.  It just leads to more and more violence, death and defeat.  Get it through your idiot
heads, already.

It's also sad that I had to mainly listen to The Clash in middle and high school to start learning about
a lot of this stuff. And that's NO shade on the band, since they're one of my favorites and one of the finest
rock bands with a message that ever existed.  I mean, it's sad that our education system is so pathetic
and lame and reactionary.  However, I will say that what's great about this film, ultimately, besides that
it's just an utter masterpiece, executed almost flawlessly, is that it doesn't take sides, it presents its
dramatization of the facts of the case, times and events, and lets the viewer think about all it depicts
and make up their own minds.  This is a very rare thing.  A must-see film.  The only thing dated in State
of Siege are the old analog TV cameras and press/revolutionaries tape recorders, etc.  Everything else
about this film is up to the minute, considering where we're at by 2015. And you know where we're at.
I walked through Penn Station two weeks ago and so yeah, I certainly know ""where we're at.""

513698,5,6302796695,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE CRITERION USA RELEASE, LATE MAY 2015.
I first saw Costa-Gavrass State Of Siege in the company of some fellow leftists when it premiered in New York City moviehouses in 1972 or 73. I was aware that the film is based on the true story of the 1970 kidnapping in Uruguay, by the urban guerilla group los Tupamaros, of American CIA Agent Dan Mitrione. (For the movie, this agent is called Philip Michael Santore and portrayed by none other than Yves Montand, which is why characters who should be speaking Spanish speak in French instead. There are also bits of English dialogue spoken by other American characters.) After a bit more than a week in captivity, Mitrione was executed after the government, parliamentary in form but daily edging closer to being a military dictatorship, refused to release any political prisoners in exchange for the high-ranking foreign captives. This is not a spoiler, for the viewer will see Mitriones corpse in the opening minutes of the film, and even the State Funeral provided for him, with hypocritical praise spewed for this great friend of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.

From here the film flashes back to the meticulously planned and executed kidnappings themselves (the Brazilian Consul to Uruguay had also been snatched but was later released). The viewer will then learn the true nature of Mitrione/Santore, he with the loving wife and seven children (nine or ten in real life, depending on what source you read). This exposition is brilliantly accomplished via the scenes of him being interrogated by his captors, who conceal their own identities by wearing hoods. [This implies the guerillas had not originally intended to execute this man; had that been the plan they wouldnt have cared if he saw their faces.] At first Santore glibly and self-righteously sticks to his cover story, that he was merely a communications and traffic expert, a benign employee of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). But to his chagrin he quickly learns that the Tupamaros have an extensive dossier on his real role and activities and they are tape recording all these interrogation sessions. Among the activities of this upstanding family man and good Christian are training police and military personnel in the use of torture by electric shock applied to the most sensitive parts of the human body, and overseeing the formation of an extra-governmental death squad. In helping to maintain governance in the interest of US corporations (United Fruit Company and the Rockefeller banking interests are named specifically), his interrogator reminds him: Your methods are war, fascism and torture. The best retort this agent of imperialism can come up with is: Youre just subversives! Communists! As if those words magically expunge his own heinous crimes! Under the laws of the United States and probably most other nations, this man could surely have been tried as an accessory to the murder, by torture or outright assassination, of innumerable individuals. Under the law, it matters not that he (presumably) didn't personally, directly participate in these crimes, keeping his fingernails clean and manicured, working out of an office at Police Headquarters (even this Santore denies initially, claiming he works elsewhere).

As the interrogations continue, we will learn that Uruguay was not the only country where Mitrione/Santore had plied his trade. I will leave it to the prospective viewer to learn those details later. In his 1975 book Inside The Company: CIA Diary Philip Agee, a former employee of that agency turned whistleblower, completely confirmed how the CIA hides its agents in Latin America and elsewhere in the world behind cover occupations, often involving USAID. And heres a note of extreme irony: this movie was filmed in Chile while Salvador Allende was president, not long before Dr. Kissinger gave the word for the overthrow, with CIA assistance of course, of that democratically elected government.

Does the filmmaker present los Tupamaros in a generally sympathetic light? That depends on ones politics. Vincent Canby, film critic for The NY Times in the 1970s, condemned this movie as crude leftist propaganda. The director shows the guerillas painted into a corner by the ruling regimes intransigence. Even the captive agent, in the end, declines to ask the United States to intervene by lobbying for the demanded release of political prisoners. The United States does not negotiate with terrorists was the official line, with Nixon in the White House. In a recent interview included with the Supplemental material on this DVD, Costa-Gavras reveals himself as a classic liberal: he clucks his tongue about violence used by the oppressed, saying it undermines any claim to morality. He even asserts that he depicted Mitrione as a good person! Perhaps he would even extend that description to the likes of Kissinger or the sneering approvers of torture under Dick Cheneys regime?

There have been Hollywood movies depicting foul goings-on within the CIA and other elements of the secret government, but none with the power of State Of Siege, since it is based on real events. We learn in the interview referred to above that a screening of the film at the American Film Institute was mysteriously canceled back in the day. One neednt be a paranoid conspiracy theorist to suspect that, with former CIA chief George H. W. Bush in the White House in 1990, a certain pressure may have been applied from on high to cause the cancellation of the scheduled US release of this film on LaserDisc. The movie had been released on VHS tape in the early 1980s, but dubbed into English and panned and scanned to fit the standard TV dimensions of the time. This did not meet my personal video standards, so the decades passed and all I could do was fume in frustration over the unavailability of this remarkable project. I am extremely grateful to Criterion Collection for finally filling this vacuum.

This reviewers sympathy was definitely with the Tupamaros when State Of Siege had its initial theatrical release in this country. Today I have no qualms whatsoever in saying my sympathy remains with the guerillas, and not with agents of the CIA doing their dirty work to maintain the rule of Capital over Humankind.

POST-SCRIPT: Now if Criterion Collection can just be persuaded to release Satyajit Ray's ""A DISTANT THUNDER"" (c. 1974, never available for home video in USA), my DVD dreams will be pretty well fulfilled! Are you reading this, someone at Criterion??",1433462400,3,6558,5.078849721706865
513699,5,6302796695,"State of Siege, directed by Costa-Gavras, is a thriller about the political assassination of an American communications specialist stationed in Latin America. As the film opens, we see police barricades on the streets and highways. Individuals and vehicles are being searched and the body of Philip Michael Santore (Yves Montand) turns up in a stolen car. Questions arise as to who, really, Santore was and what he was doing in Latin America. A flashback to his kidnapping indicates why he was targeted.

The movie clearly has a strong point of view  it is a critique of the American government support of foreign dictatorships and also addresses how radical violence opposes such regimes.  The 1972 film is timely because of its focus on political torture employed in the name of national security. A graphic scene in which operatives torture live subjects on stage in front of the military is tough to watch, though incredibly powerful and integral to the story. Those photos taken at Abu Ghraib and the controversy about Americas role in torturing political prisoners come to mind.

Bonus features on the new digital transfer Blu-ray release include a new conversation between director Costa-Gavras and film scholar Peter Cowie; NBC News excerpts from 1970 on the kidnapping of Dan Mitrione, on which the film is based; and a critical essay.

But, he refrains from completely demonizing one side versus the other, but prefers to show a clash of ideologies; one driven and motivated by ""capital interests"" (the US and their puppets), and the other seemingly motivated by ""ideals"" (the rebels). However, one knows from experience and history, that once any opposing or revolutionary force adopts the means and the methods of their oppressors; they become just like them (i.e., Fidel Castro, Cesar Chavez, etc.), in other words; ""terrorists""!

This is an excellent and timely film, with so many parallels to the actual and present conditions in the world today. I highly recommend it.

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, another fine job by the Criterion Collection. NTSC format, French (English subtitles), NR 121 mins.

7831428,1,6302796695,"This film is failed attempt by Costas-Gravas to translate his understanding of events in Greece to events in South America. The film fails because his experiences in Europe don't really translate very well. The film has a bunch of Marxist superman kidnap and eventually kill an American. Like typical Marxist superman, they have no private life, no emotions and no personality beyond their duty to the party which is why films about them tend to be really boring (like this one).

You get about 20 minutes of kidnap plot. Then there is a long period where the terrorist ubermen interrogate their captive into a voluntary confession of all his various evils. But in reality, the interrogation is basically a long series of exposition by Costas-Gravas about the political situation in South America in the 1970s. The film itself vainly attempts to show that the execution of the kidnap victim will not only no longer have any positive political value, but will in fact be negative to our little band of rebels. But then he spends about five minutes of screen time recording the individual votes of the central commitee in favor of the exeuction.

As usual,  Yves Montand puts in a good performance in a film that does not really deserve it. The film also has a contradiction build in. The terrorists which at the beginning are shown as unstoppable professional superman suddenly become the keystone cops with nearly their entire leadership rounded by the police in one raid.

The film was ironically released at about the same time that the movement its story was based on (the Tumparmeros) collapsed. The events documented in the film amounted to a long suicide note by the Tumparmeros as a political organization. Resorting to political assassination, kidnapping and murder quickly lead to the demise of the organization. Costas-Gravas understood events in Greece (""Z""), but in this film he is simply out of his depth.",1448582400,3,1918,4.965732087227415
