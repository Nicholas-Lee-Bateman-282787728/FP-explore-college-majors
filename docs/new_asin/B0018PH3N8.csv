8270444,5,B0018PH3N8,Excellent movie.  Great to show gay youth who struggle...,1469404800,,57,5.333333333333333
8270445,5,B0018PH3N8,"I myself grew up in the church, and struggled with homosexuality.  I am so proud of these kids, and pray for them and their supporters.  I know the pain of reconciling Christianity and homosexuality can almost seem impossible - but know that I learned to accept both part of myself and I have come so far.  Your life will not be miserable, your life on Earth is what you make of it and God will welcome you with open arms.  We were all created in his image.",1360022400,,457,4.218390804597701
8270446,5,B0018PH3N8,"What ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is excellent in doing for adults in learning why gays are acceptable to God, ""CAMP OUT"" does for Teenagers.  I rented it from Netflix and as soon as I watched it knew I had to have it in my personal library. I think every church should have a copy to help their gay youth know that God Loves them and it is God who loves them, even if some of the members of their church do not.",1342828800,,411,3.892857142857143

The church is individualistic, self-centered, and self-contradictory: this movie compliments that reality. The kids presented are beautiful; the ideas propogated are nonsensical. Watch and see why the world thinks Christianity is irrelevant.",1302739200,3,704,10.557377049180328
8270448,3,B0018PH3N8,I didn't particularly like any of the teens in this flick. It just seemed kind of weird to me. Maybe I'm too far past my teen years to relate to it.,1231027200,,148,3.806451612903226
8270449,5,B0018PH3N8,"This documentry was great.  The kids- now adults- did a great job telling their story about trying to cope being gay in a  stright world.  This camp helped them find new friends.  I was watching this movie thinking that some campers as young as age 14 had the courage to come out to family and friends and I know that would have been hard for me at their age.  I wish there was a camp like this when I was the campers age.  It would have been a little eaiser for me knowing that I wasn't the only gay teen boy around.  I don't mean to quote the movie but about 14 years ago I felt so alone since I felt that I was the only gay male near me.  During my High School years there were no gay clubs or anything like that. I would like to thank the producers and the campers-- Tim, Thomas, Jesse,Spencer, Kosono, Chris, Christine, Alison, Kristi and the rest-- you helped with the first ever gay religous camp and opened many eyes.  If there is ever a sequel-- I cant wait to hear how the camp has effected your lives in the long run.",1230854400,2,1028,4.1
8270450,4,B0018PH3N8,"Interesting documentary on a group of teens grappling with being gay and their Christian beliefs. Warm and fuzzy without being cloying, but this is not a disc that will see lots of daylight - once seen, there is little to be gained from a second playback. Rent it first - there are plenty of good films that cost a lot less and will deliver repeat performances.",1228608000,4,361,4.484848484848484
8270451,5,B0018PH3N8,"Many of the new LGBT documentaries that come out are dealing with difficult, cutting edge topics. Camp Out is no exception. Very high quality, the movie looks to just capture five days of the first LGBT youth Christian camp. The directors take a neutral role, wanting to show the raw struggles that gay Christian youth go through. Whether you believe homosexuality is compatabile with Christianity or not, this film is about the diverse youth that many of us know and a great opportunity to learn about the upcoming generation. As a gay Christian youth, this movie helped confirm that there are many others like myself dealing with similar issues. Great praise for Camp Out and The Naming Project.",1218240000,5,697,4.915254237288136
8270452,5,B0018PH3N8,"This film was so well done it made me laugh and it also made me cry but what is did most of all is open my eye`s to how hard it is for some young adults
to have to struggle with their everyday living and how they deal with their feeling`s.
But I have a feeling everyone of these young people will do GREAT in this life we all have to just keep fighting the fight!
Thank you Tim, Jesse, Christine,Thomas ect, for that peek into your lives and opening alot of peoples eye`s!",1213488000,8,472,4.031914893617022
8270453,5,B0018PH3N8,"This doc about gay teens who attend a Bible camp is fascinating. Watching the kids open up about their religious beliefs and their sexual orientation is very compelling. I saw the movie at Outfest, LA's gay film festival, and the audience went wild -- giving a huge standing ovation at the end. In fact it won the audience award for the best doc that year. I'll definitely get a copy to add to my collection when it comes out. Both the gay and Christian communities can learn a lot through the kids' honesty.",1210982400,15,508,4.473118279569892
