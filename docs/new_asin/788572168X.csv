7900902,4,788572168X,"Paulette Goddard was the frontrunner to play Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind"" until Vivien Leigh pipped her at the post. Four years later, Goddard finally got the chance to play another firebrand Southern belle in Cecil B. DeMille's REAP THE WILD WIND, a costume adventure with the emphasis on costume--and filmed in glowing early Technicolor.

Goddard plays Loxi Claiborne, the feisty manager of a ship salvage company in 1840s Key West, Florida. Loxi falls in love with Captain Jack Stuart (John Wayne); but later finds herself caught under the spell of his attractive arch-rival, lawyer Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland). Playing one man off the other, Loxi gets caught in the middle of a dangerous battle between rival shipping companies, masterminded by scheming King Cutler (Raymond Massey).

REAP THE WILD WIND, based on a story written by Thelma Strabel, is an energetic movie with something for everyone: costume drama, romance, pirates, action, and a spectacular sequence featuring a giant squid (the film picked up an Academy Award for 'Best Visual Effects' in 1943).

Paulette Goddard is a sensation playing the firebrand heroine Loxi Claiborne; she would have been just as superb as Scarlett O'Hara. John Wayne and Ray Milland also provide strong performances as the two men vying for Loxi's hand. A very young Susan Hayward and Robert Preston are touching, playing ill-fated forbidden sweethearts (they would later be re-united for ""Tulsa"" in 1949).
