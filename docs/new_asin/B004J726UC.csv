4390597,5,B004J726UC,"The Scala ""forza"" now goes to the top of my list. This will replace the San Carlo version, which cast is still hard to top. Despite Corelli, Tebaldi & Christoff, certain flaws mar this dvd. First, there seemed to have been spots on the camera while filming. Also, lines permeate the screen. Last, but not least, the disk goes to another layer during Corelli's big aria, causing a blurp. I notice now most disk companies are issuing a second disk to combat this problem. But the Scala cast is almost as good and the picture, while a bit dark in places, is streets ahead of San Carlo. As a side bit, Nave is a pleasant surprise on the Scala version. Anyway, both disks beat the rest of the field. On the whole, I am pretty much in accord with DDD's views here.",1313712000,4,758,4.345070422535211
4390598,5,B004J726UC,"Maestro Carreras, as ususal in that time, was WONDERFUL; he's performance is so clean, so magistral !!!
It's also one of the most famous Verdi's operas and Monserrat Caball is magnificent.",1304294400,5,188,5.096774193548387
4390599,5,B004J726UC,"This is a very good classic production of this magnificent opera, with excellent singers and orchestra.  If I say classic production, I mean that it is the typical acting and scenery of the past years, since now days, the resources for production of operas are unlimited, as well as the acting of the singers has improved and evolved according to modern standards.
Nevertheless, to hear Mrs. Caballe and Carreras together is a real treat, and a must for opera lovers/
There are very few versions of La Forza,and none modern at all. In fact, this opera is rarely preformed in theaters, due to the apparent curse  for singers, musicians and directors... too bad, since it is a beautiful masterpiece. I am happy to have this version and it will be a delight to see and hear it over and over.",1303171200,10,788,4.621428571428571
4390600,4,B004J726UC,"A long due transfer to DVD, this Forza shows La Caballe in splendid [vocal] form. Her pianissimi are something to die for. Carreras displays a fantastiic voic and goes through Alvaro without any major problems in spite of his tendency to imitate the bad habits of Di Stefano. Capuccilli, Ghiaurov and Bruscantini at their peak. Bruscantini makes a delightful Melitone that foreshadows Falstaff. Patan is very convincing. The production stinks. Looks really cheap. And what to say of Leonora's death scene? A prima donna who dies on her feet just turning around is pure laughstock. Yet, after the ABC of all the Forzas (Arroyo, Bergonzi & Capuccilli)on CD this could be a second runner after the first runner DVD with Price, Giacomini and Nucci. In sum, this Forza is strongly recommended.",1302480000,14,788,5.022900763358779
4390601,5,B004J726UC,"La Forza del Destino has not been well treated on DVD--that is until now. The Met production with Leontyne Price hardly documents her in a favorable light--the two CD sets with her are evidence that when the Met got around to a video performance it was too late. Other DVD performances are routine and/or poorly cast. The 1958 Naples performance with a festival cast has been improved visually from the VHS tape, but even so one has to bring a substantial amount of imagination to be able to enjoy watching it. The singing of course is stunning. This current release may lack the type of voices that Forza requires but it is as close to what Verdi demands as you are going to find in a world where Verdi voices are truly an endangered species. Dramatically the performance is hardly inspired and the sets leave a lot to be desired. But these singers for the most part can deliver and for that we should be thankful.

Caballe is hardly a true spinto; she also lacks chest tones so that low notes are somewhat growled and frequently she tends to lunge at high notes unless she is singing piano or pianissimo and at those points she can be almost heavenly. In many recordings she seems to be sight reading the music, but here she delivers the text and gives a committed performance. Companarable to Milanov? To Callas?  Even to Caniglia? Hardly, but there are enough moments to savor that you know you are hearing a real performance. A very young Carreras (very handsome as well) was clearly stretching his voice for the role that requires a Corelli or a del Monaco. By the time that he got around to recording the bizarre DGG performance the voice is so compromised by his illness and his choice rolls that he is unable to emmit a steady tone, under control. Fortunately in 1978 he can still be profligate with these gifts and most of what he does is beautiful even though we know  that the role demands a larger voice. Capucilli is the real thing, a Verdi baritone for which no excuses need be made. He has been accursed of being stolid and unimaginative. I was lucky enough to see him several times in Vienna and I never felt that he was just going through the motions. Here he is quite splendid and together with Carreras they are both exciting and we are lucky enough to have the Sleale duet which is cut more often than not. Ghiaurov is a very good Guardiano  even though he sports one of the worst wigs and beards I have ever seen. Surely Scala can do better than this.

My first encounter with the opera was the old Cetra performance conducted by the great Marinuzzi. The cast is all Italian and even today it remains a benchmark for the opera. It certainly was Caniglia's greatest performance. Merli was an underrated tenor--I assume that restricting himself to Italy was part of the reason. That and the war. Rounding out the cast were Pasero and Stignani. When it was first released on LP it was missing a lot of music; by the time it was issued on CD more music was added. As great as Price and Callas (alas by the time Milanov went into the studio it was too late) are both must yield to this early performance for sheer brio, style and excitement engendered by Marinuzzi's leadership. Patane has a different view of the opera; the tempos seem more relaxed than his predecessor and I must admit that there were times when I wanted to prod the music along. But in the end all my criticisms have to fall by the wayside; I can overlook the sets and some of the costumes and revel in the kind of singing that is not longer being heard in today's houses. Perhaps lurking in the archives in one of the Italian theatres there is a performance than can top this one. Unlikely.",1302134400,21,3678,4.475409836065574
4390602,5,B004J726UC,"Amazing !
I've been waiting long long years for this to be issued and remastered on DVD.
At last ! And such great work they did: nice video and great live sound.
Carreras is Heaven. I also respect Corelli and his devoted fans, but Jose's phrasing, velvety lyric voice and looks made him the ideal cast for this luscious 1978 La Scala production. Caballe, Cappuccilli, Ghiaurov are all in top form and great great vocal personalities, but the young , at that time 32yo spaniard tenor simply steals the show and drives the audience crazy. Watch and see for yourself.",1300838400,37,564,4.65

8431721,5,B004J726UC,"OK, show of hands - who remembers Legato Classics?  How about Myto?  Are they still around even?  Well, in mid-90's these labels were opera fan's treasure-troves.  They specialized in (often poorly recorded or even pirated) amazing live performances.  The studios, even the best of them, are limited by contracts and other red tape that makes it very difficult for them to put together ""dream-casts"".  Opera houses also have their share of red tape, but back in the 70's and 80's it seems there had more freedom to engage artists from all over the spectrum and according to conductors' visions.  Giuseppe Patane was an esteemed opera conductor, a LaScala legend, so it's no wonder he was able to pull together the best La Forza cast imaginable at the time.  This is a 1978 performance, and it's recorded/restored really well, the sonics are clear and accurate.

This sprawling epic opera just happens to be my favourite of all Verdi's highly melodic and drama-filled scores.  It really has it all - the star-crossed lovers, the grim avenger, several false identities, war, monks, and gypsies, but above all - the action!  And unlike Verdi's early Rossini-influenced numbers, La Forza is paving the way to Verdi's revolutionary Otello and Falstaff with its multiple breaks-from-the-canon.  It's premier in St. Petersburg in 1862 was a runway success, although for this production (and most recordings) it's common to use the revised 1869 Antonio Ghislanzoni version with its famous Fate-themed (triple-E's) overture.

Having been not entirely content with Legato's rather muffled recording for a while I've been eagerly anticipating the DVD release with improved sound - and, of course- visuals.  For an action-filled opera, it really helps to see what's going on - and here no one disappoints.  Every singer is completely committed to his/her character, and even if some costumes make them uncomfortable (such is the cast for Caballe), they soldier on in the most commendable manner.  Carreras, Caballe, Cappuccilli, Ghiaurov, and Bruscantini - all caught right or near their prime - sing their hearts out, almost as if each tries to upstage the other.  The male leads - Jose Carreras and Piero Cappuccilli both cut dashing figures on stage and have excellent voices to match, and luckily this production doesn't cut their music, as so many others do.  The great soprano Montserrat Caballe isn't the most compelling visually, but she acts well and sings so beautifully that it's impossible to fault her plus-size.  Those ethereal pianissimi...  The great Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, luxuriously cast as Padre Guardiano, sounds like the voice of the Almighty Himself.  At one point, as his character exits, he actually has a very satisfied smile on his face that seems to say ""that went well!""  (or he also could be chuckling at his wig, we'll never know).  Veteran Sesto Bruscantini provides a great comic relief as Fra Melitone and Maria Luisa Nave is a looker of a Preziosilla.  Without them, this would be one bleak opera, to be sure.

It was definitely one of those nights when everything goes just right.  Many critics decried the vocal decline of Jose Carreras in late 80's, those interested in his biography will be able to quickly ascertain the causes of that, but here he's truly a force of nature.  A beautiful burnished tenor with easy ringing top notes, sustained legato, and impeccable phrasing.  Yes, he pushed his voice, but the results were so glorious, no wonder the audience goes crazy!  He and Caballe along with Cappuccilli and Ghiaurov collaborated many times during that era, and luckily there are some recordings available (not nearly enough though) of this all-star ensemble.  This DVD ranks near the top; in fact one would be hard-pressed to find a better production of this masterwork.  I doubt very much that it will stay in circulation for long, so don't delay getting your hands on this gem.",1362009600,7,3925,5.048136645962733
8431722,3,B004J726UC,"I agree with all of the good things people said.  Especially about Carreras-he is young and beyond words in his singing....The problem is is that this dvd (which was made in 2011) was made from a 1978 video.  the audio is high quality, the visuals are a little dark... Also there are 3 or 4 places where the dvd just stops (pauses) and then continues.  I bought this new in September.  I think that these pauses are due to the video recording.  I had similar things happen when i transferred family videos to dvd...with this, i still recommend this dvd",1319587200,8,552,4.48
8431723,5,B004J726UC,"Yes I'll add to the chorus of the love fest for this Forza. It simply is the best  available on DVD. As much as I loved Corelli when I saw him a couple of times in this role, Carreras is perfect for Alvaro. He is young, petulant, virile, volatile and in great voice. And he looks the part. He defined the role in Andrea Chenier and he defines it here although it is almost too much for him. He will still be unforgetable. I've been attending performances of this opera since the days of Zinka in the old Met. and I've heard a lot of bleeting tenors best forgotten in the part until I heard Corelli. This performance of Carreras is as close to his stature as I've ever heard. Cappucilli is a great Don Carlo of Calatrava. Such a clear robust voice evenly forceful throughout its range. The two male leads work beautifully together; he was the nemesis of Carreras in Andrea Chenier also. The two have been paired with great success in many other operas. And as for Montserrat Caballe what is there to say. She is maybe not the spinto of Milanov but her lush pianissimos are a sound from heaven. No she can't act and there was not much acting in this production but who cares; there was singing from everyone. The sets by Renatto Guttuso where weird and had the look of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" about them but were fine. Ghiaurov was a good Guardiano, Nave a quite competent Preziosilla and Bruscantini as Fra Melitone trumped everyone in the scenes he was in. Yes this is the best Forza around and it is a treasure.",1315872000,11,1516,4.375886524822695
