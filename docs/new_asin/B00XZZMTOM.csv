7204581,4,B00XZZMTOM,I loved Chris Farley and hated he left the planet so soon. This movie takes you through the highs and lows of a lride way to fast for anyone including Chris Farley,1481328000,,163,4.125
7204582,5,B00XZZMTOM,A great tribute to an amazing star. Truly one of the best documentaries about Chris Farley,1480723200,,90,4.6875
7204583,4,B00XZZMTOM,It is a sad but true story of a very talented young comedian who battled with substance abuse and extremely low self esteem.  It was hard to watch such a talented rising star going down a very slippery and deadly slope.  It was well narrated by his brother and friends and coworkers.  I heard about Chris at our Thanksgiving dinner this year and really did not watch him.  I did want to watch the documentary to get to know who Chris was and how her performed.  This is an excellent documentary for those of you who followed Chris's career and loved to watch him.  I learned a great deal of information and was devastated to learn that he died way before his time. This is a must see documentary for his fans.,1480636800,,709,4.333333333333333

7204587,5,B00XZZMTOM,"4.5 Stars. A great documentary about Chris!!
The only flaw I see - is All interviewed Don't understand addiction. It is More than implied that 'Sobriety' is only about staying off booze and other drugs. True sobriety is about dealing with the plethora of underlying unresolved issues and daily challenges.
Sad - it seems Chris never got the full taste of sobriety. What an Amazing Talent - and loss to us all!!
I was Honored and Blessed myself to perform once with Chris's brother Kevin - who does a Great job sharing with us

7204592,4,B00XZZMTOM,"This was an interesting, but superficial, look at the career of Chris Farley. Overall, the story is much more positive than negative. One really interesting aspect was all the stories from other comedians; it was so clear what kind of impact he had on their lives. However, having also read the book, ""The Chris Farley Show""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chris-Farley-Show-A-Biography-in-Three-Acts/dp/B00164X2OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts</a>, I was surprised by what was sort of glossed over in Chris' life--namely his father and his drug/alcohol use. Therefore, I think if you've read the book, ""I am Chris Farley"" might be enjoyable, but not necessarily memorable.",1470700800,2,766,6.304761904761905

7204602,3,B00XZZMTOM,"Standard talking head bio-pic on an anything-but-standard performer. It is well-made, at least. If you're already a Farley fan, this is mostly familiar territory. If you have no idea who Chris Farley is, this is a pretty good place to start. Or just watch the old SNL Chippendale's sketch online. That shows Farley at his funniest, and most vulnerable. He was a sweet soul, and it is obvious that a lot of people (many of whom appear in this movie) loved him very much.",1466208000,,469,4.595238095238095

7204654,3,B00XZZMTOM,"This is a nice documentary about Chris Farley. It takes his life chronologically. It shows an idyllic upbringing with his loving family. He's definitely the class clown. Then it's on to Second City and Saturday Night Live. All the great comedians tell wonderful stories about him. It's a lovely fun time. The last act has more about his addiction problems. It's not hidden in the movie but it doesn't dwell on it. It's probably the only glaring thing missing. It doesn't so much gloss over Farley's problems as much as explain it away. After the midway point, a tougher documentary would have zeroed in on his addictions. It takes the material with a lighter touch. It's to be expected with a film that has the full cooperation of his family and friends.",1446249600,3,754,4.71969696969697

7204682,3,B00XZZMTOM,"3.5 stars from me.

This documentary reminded me of the ""real"" Chris Farley, not the eulogized Chris Farley, for better or worse -- better because he really did some funny stuff, and worse because a lot of it was extremely juvenile.  (The parts with his brothers really reminded me of that.)

Let's face it: Farley died at the peak of his career, and if his bulb hadn't popped, he probably would have met the same terrible fate that Adam Sandler and David Spade have met, pumping out obnoxious trash like ""Grown-Ups"" and ""Pixels.""  Yes, he would still be charismatic, but it probably wouldn't be high quality.  The movies were already starting to slip by the late 90s, and the gags wearing thin.

So the movie was a mixed bag.  It was slow getting off the ground, but it does take you through some of the highlights and lowlights of Chris's career.  As a Farley fan, I had to watch it, and it delivered, but it reminded me that Farley's contributions to American TV and film, while undeniably hilarious at times, also had a lot of weaker moments.",1444003200,,1046,4.55614973262032

7204689,5,B00XZZMTOM,"I grew up with talking to my friends on Monday mornings in High school about what Chris Farley had done on SNL, that last weekend. I saw some new sketches, namely 'DANT&Eacute;' which I've not seen prior. The special in Xtras Section sheds some bright light on his Family, Hometown, & Upbringing.  Brought so much Joy to everyone around him. The drug & Alcohol abuse was downplayed,  (BIGTIME). Never get why they do that in documentaries. Obviously he died at 33-from Speedballs. It's like a Taboo Subject. I purchase these Discs to know UNknown things about his past and final hours. Strange how they all keep that under wraps. It is what it is",1443312000,3,646,4.657894736842105

They did an excellent job in bringing his legacy back to life and showing the world how truly great a performer he was and a good human being despite his drug addiction. This documentary shows the side of Chris Farley that no one else saw besides his friends and family. I never met the guy but after watching this documentary, I wish I did at some point. It's worth watching whether if you are or not a fan of him, some great stories that former SNL cast members tell and all of them you can tell loved the guy and miss him so much to this day.",1443139200,,652,4.1015625

7204698,5,B00XZZMTOM,"This film is wonderful but hard to watch. Chris came onto SNL while I was in Los Angeles finishing music school so I associate Him with the best years of my life. It really took me back the day I heard The radio dj (while nearly breaking down), announce that Chris had passed. I had to pull the car over. It just sucks. We need Him more now than ever in this world that gets a little darker every day. This situation still really takes the wind out of my sails even 18 years later. Everyone interviewed loved Chris and that was really nice. Nobody tore Him apart because He had a problem. If you love and miss Chris you should watch this film but it is a little sad. Don't get me wrong, I laughed...until I cried. They describe at the end that Chris had no mold. Just comets and stars and light. Ironic that the comet Hail-Bop (spellcheck), was in orbit and visible the year Chris died. It was probably just his ride. RIP Chris.

7204731,5,B00XZZMTOM,"Wow!  This was such a great watch.  It was fairly upbeat, which is something I appreciated a lot.  Just hearing or seeing Chris Farley is an instant reminder of what we missed out on with him being taken from us at such an early age.  So I was happy that they didn't focus too much on his drug abuse, they touch on it, but it's not the focus.  What I loved most about this was that you can tell that the people they interviewed genuinely love and deeply miss Chris Farley still to this day.  There are some great comedians in this talking about Chris like he was head and shoulders above them when it came to talent.  I've long considered Farley to be the funniest person I've ever seen, so it was nice to hear such prominent figures in the comedy world agree.  It was pretty cool to learn that one of his movies was very closely related to his life, something I was not aware of.  There is some footage of his early days that I had never seen before, as well as come really cool pictures of Chris.  If you enjoy Chris Farley at all, this is a must watch for you.

I'd guarantee you wouldn't be disappointed, but how do you know I'm not some crazy glue sniffer? ""Building model airplanes"" says the little commenter ; well, we're not buying it. He sneaks into your house once, that's all it takes. The next thing you know, there's money missing off the dresser, and your daughter's knocked up. I seen it a hundred times.

It does a decent job of career history and showing performance clips.  However, no in-depth insight as why he developed self-image or addiction problems.  No mention whatsoever of drug issues until the last 10 min of the documentary.  Too many allusions to incidents that are not explained.  For example, Mike Myers talks about a time where he tried to talk sense to Farley after some apparent bad incident, but no description of the incident is given.  Also, a friend of Farley's says he remembers signs in high school of problems (presumably drugs) but no description given.

7204779,4,B00XZZMTOM,"I Am Chris Farley is the entertaining story of the Saturday Night Live comedian who died from a drug overdose at age 33 in 1997. The documentary showcases many of Farleys characters and skits from TV and film along with photographs, home movies and family snapshots. Among the excerpts: Farleys Chippendales audition skit with Patrick Swayze, his ill-fated salesman in Tommy Boy, and his diatribes as Matt Foley, motivational speaker who lives in a van down by the river. Theres also a video of Farleys sketches at Chicagos Second City comedy theater.

Thoughts on Farley are provided in on-screen interviews with Christina Applegate, Tom Arnold, Dan Ackroyd, Bo Derek, Jon Lovitz, Mike Myers, Bob Sagat, Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, David Spade and Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. Also contributing comments are Farleys brothers and sister, who portray him as the family clown and school athlete. One of his brothers, Kevin, is an executive producer of this documentary.

Farleys tenure on Saturday Night Live lasted from 1990 to 1995. Producer Lorne Michaels offers personal insights into Farleys personality and how his work ethic made him an important contributor to the casts collaborative efforts to do their best. The film doesnt attempt to mask Farleys drug dependence as several co-workers and friends discuss how Farley had trouble dealing with the instant fame his appearances on the show generated. Though he thrived on audience laughter, off stage Farley often sank into darkness and despair.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a featurette on the Farley siblings and a photo gallery.",1439164800,3,1619,5.243243243243243
7204780,3,B00XZZMTOM,"The best way to illustrate my misgivings with ""I Am Chris Farley"" is to compare it to the excellent biography published in 2009.  The book, an arrangement of recollections from Farley's friends, family and contemporaries, is essentially a documentary in written form.  It even features many of the same participants, including Bob Odenkirk, David Spade, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Dan Akroyd, Lorne Michaels, Tom Arnold and Farley's siblings.

But where the book was an unflinching, objective examination of the beloved performer's undeniable talent, his tremendous warmth and the demons that killed him, the movie has much more of an agenda, and that agenda is to not upset you.  The doc is roughly structured into three parts, each more rushed and kid-gloved than the one before.  After an excellent opening section covering Farley's childhood and entrance into professional comedy (which includes rare Second City footage and excellent insight from Bob Odenkirk), the doc becomes oddly focused, which is particularly troublesome considering its scant 95-minute runtime.

Farley's tragically brief career at SNL and in feature film is glossed over.  The actor's filmography is short enough that you would reasonably expect all of the productions to be covered, including the unmade projects like Shrek and the Fatty Arbunkle biopic that would have been penned by David Mamet.  Instead, they skip even some of his released films, including Almost Heroes and Bob Saget's Dirty Work, despite the fact that Saget is on hand.  Precious time is wasted when the documentary does little more than unspool a well-known sketch and then have the interviewees reflect on how funny it was.

The documentary's final third is naturally reserved for Farley's self-destructive spiral, but it's handled in a bizarrely vague and filtered way.  Allusions are made to Farley's ""appetites"" with nary a direct reference made to his drug abuse.  No details or hint of unpleasantness are permitted, nor do some of Farley's more alarming final appearances, like his Jay Leno interview in 1997, get shown.  Even his death is something more implied than discussed.  It goes well beyond tasteful restraint and into the realm of insulting.  There's a distinct impression that the Farley Estate - particularly Kevin Farley, who bookends the film with a standup set - was given final cut and steered the documentary into a eulogy instead of an honest examination, complete with sentimental stock music instructing you how to feel.  It's the sort of slanted paean you would expect to have been produced in 1998, not nearly twenty years after the fact.

I can still recommend this to Farley fans, since all the memories these guys share are worth hearing.  I just wish they didn't feel so strategically selected.  It wouldn't surprise me if a longer cut more worthy of Farley once existed, but the end result can only be seen as an insufficient, sugarcoated companion piece to a far superior book, a book which suggest how excellent this doc might and should have been.",1439164800,54,3036,5.146639511201629

7204782,5,B00XZZMTOM,"Wow last reviewer we are a little bitter arnt we?
This fIlm follows the life and career of Legendary comedic actor Chris Farley told by the people that he knew and loved. Friends, family, and co workers all describe the gentle giant that was Farley. Yes his ups and downs are brought to light. His drug abuse and low self esteem is looked at. His untimely death at 33 at the same age and in the same way as his idol the equally talented and missed SNL co-alum John Belushi. All this and his genius explosive humor and incredibly kind heart are out on display. Farley wasn't a Hollywood addict. He wasn't flaunting his flaws or running out to make a career of his reality. He had genuine self esteem problems and through it all he just wanted to make other people laugh. A great kind man taken too soon by his own sad demons. A beautiful comedic light burnt out in his prime by the laughter he so loved to create",1437955200,41,911,4.3023255813953485

8717250,4,B00XZZMTOM,"A great eulogy style documentary about Chris Farley. What I mean by that is that it is mostly clips from his performances and friends and co-workers telling stories about him. If you are looking for an in-depth look at his career or a biography of his life this is not the documentary for you.  However, if you want to a feel good look at his life by his friends this is the documentary for you.",1494633600,,395,4.266666666666667
