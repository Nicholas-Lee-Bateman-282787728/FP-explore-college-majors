7569839,5,B019C6X02M,"I loved this movie. Grandma, Lily Tomlin, is a bohemian poet of cult fame. She has a type A daughter whose chilly success helps compensate for her unorthodox childhood, and for the family loss they both share that has driven them apart, and created distance with the daughter's own daughter. So Grandma is recruited to help her teenaged granddaughter with a problem that is difficult yet universal. In the process everyone comes to term with their issues in a way that is heartwarming, in a gritty way. Nice cast and tasteful treatment of a difficult topic. I grew up in the 70s, and Grandma reminded me of my mother, so I found it lovely. I appreciated the diverse cast a lot.",1454976000,5,677,4.603305785123967

When she gets into a fight with her girlfriend and they break up she acts tough. When her granddaughter Sage (Garner) asking for her help Elle takes her under her wing and does everything she can to help her out. What Elle finds is that this experience helps her more than she expected. This is a movie I was not sure what to expect. The few Lily Tomlin movies I have seen have been Big Business and 9 to 5, not really my favorites. I was totally shocked by her in this movie, in a good way. Lily Tomlin is hilarious in this and plays a role you have never seen her in before. Picture Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa as portrayed by Lily Tomlin. The stuff she says is pretty offensive and so out of the blue that you can't help but laugh. The movie does have a very good message and is very much worth seeing but the real reason to check this out is for Lily Tomlin. Overall, smartly written with a version of Lily Tomlin you have never seen. I give this a B+.",1454889600,3,1074,4.143540669856459
7569841,4,B019C6X02M,"Despite not being a laugh out loud movie, Grandma is abundantly humorous if you've the predilection for dramedies not relying on a sledgehammer for comedic delivery. The script is very tight, with a steady stream of one-liners from Lily Tomlin layered atop a subtext more apparent upon learning what makes these characters tick. Grandma is the story of an abortion, and while this doesn't sound particularly like the crux of a good joke, the film proves that in some cases there's nothing like an abortion to bring a family closer together.

You'll be reminded of how powerful Tomlin can be when she's a central rather than supporting character; I'm a born-again fan now. Thanks for that, Paul Weitz!",1454025600,2,700,4.932203389830509

""Grandma"" is a good funny-serious, light-heavy film. It doesn't try to be anything truly special, which is one of its biggest strengths. While I did hear a few lols from the people behind me in the theater, the humor is mostly of a quieter variety, and it's almost entirely in the script. The plot is much the same way: There aren't a lot of big turnabouts or serious action. A few draggy spots, but the tension builds slowly and subtly. Predictable, but not ruinously so. There were times when I got impatient with ""Grandma,"" but in the end, I was glad to have seen it. There are also few films this brief whose brevity works so well in their favor. All that being said, people in search of absolute hilarity, lots of excitement, and what-not should probably look elsewhere.

Lily Tomlin gives a nice performance as the somewhat unstable, misanthropic, but ultimately compassionate Grandma Elle Reid. Julia Garner quietly tops her--and I think it was intended this way--as Sage, who appears at first to be a stereotypically vacuous adolescent-in-crisis yet turns out to be much wiser and stronger than we realize. Marcia Gay Harden's performance as the Sage's mom/Elle's daughter is brief but memorable. The three generations of women are quite fascinating. There have been complaints about the ""shallow"" characterization, as well as the apparent feminazi agenda. Still, Grandma's old boyfriend Karl (Sam Elliott) is one of the strongest characters in the film, and he's developed very well in a short space of time. Although I'm a guy who's pretty sensitive to misandry, I was not at all offended by any of the film's apparent statements. Without trying too hard, ""Grandma"" has much to show about familiar relations, life and humanity, and various other things.

Obviously adult subject matter, but Sage's unplanned pregnancy is treated with just the right mix of sensitivity and levity. Lots of f-bombs, but no nudity, gore, or violence. Many mid-teens and up should enjoy ""Grandma""; ""R"" rating notwithstanding, most younger audiences would probably be bored and confused by it.",1450483200,17,2094,5.046242774566474
7569843,5,B019C6X02M,"Directed and written by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, American Pie), Grandma is a quirky little comedy-drama made on a shoestring budget but with some truly stellar talents involved.  Structured in ""chapters"", it takes place in a single day but deals with things in the characters' lives that go back decades, showing that life is not a thread but a tapestry of many threads that end up woven together. Whether they want to be or not.

Elle Reid (marvelously played by Lily Tomlin) is a lesbian poet who's going through a lot in her life.  The film begins with her ending a four-month relationship she's been having with a younger woman named Oliva (Judy Greer) because she hasn't really gotten over the recent death of her life partner, a woman with whom she shared decades together. No sooner does she finish dealing with that awkward parting than her eighteen-year-old grand-daughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up at her door to tell her that she's pregnant and needs $630 for an abortion. Which is a problem because Elle is flat broke (poet not being a high-income profession to say the least) and Sage has had her credit cards cancelled by her disapproving control-freak mother, Judy (Marcia Gay Harden). So the day turns into a road trip with Elle taking Sage around in her barely functional heap of a car in a quest to find the money needed for the abortion.

A lot of the best parts - comedic and dramatic - come out through the dialogue as we get to know these seemingly disparate characters. Elle is caustic, over-the-top outspoken and darkly funny, while Sage is more than a little passive and reluctant to assert herself, which drives Elle up the wall.  And in between lies Judy, whose presence is felt long before she actually appears, as Elle and Sage bond over their mutual frustration and exasperation with the difficult mother/daughter who links them together.

A lot of what makes Grandma work is its very talented cast.  Nat Wolff (Paper Towns, The Fault in Our Stars) is appropriately self-centered and responsibility-averse as Cam, Sage's boyfriend and impregnator. Sam Elliott (Justified, The Big Lebowski) does an intricately nuanced turn as Karl, a man with some highly mixed history with Elle which comes as a complete surprise to Sage. Elizabeth Pea (Resurrection Blvd, Lone Star) as Elle's friend Carla shows how friends aren't always who you thought they were when it comes to money.  Julia Garner (Martha Marcy May Marlene) brings out Sage's awkwardness both physically and emotionally, a young woman who's really still a girl but is having to take a crash course in making a woman's decisions. Marcia Gay Harden (Mystic River, Pollack) has less screen time to make her character Judy felt, but she pulls it off in firm masterful strokes, quickly bringing out hard-driving Judy's take-charge my-way-or-else approach to life but still managing to show that beneath her harsh exterior she does still care - if she can only back off long enough to show it.  And then there's Lily Tomlin (The West Wing, The Late Show, Nashville) who gives Grandma its center with Elle's tough outspoken persona softened by revelations showing that much as she'd like to pretend otherwise, she has her share of issues that never really got resolved either.

Interesting note:  the car that Elle drives in the movie is actually Lily Tomlin's own 1955 Dodge Royal that she bought back in 1975 for $1,500.  According to Tomlin ""It's not a prize car. It's not a car that people yearn for. But it has a nice look to it. The car is almost a character in the movie. I knew I kept that car for a reason.""

At 79 minutes, Grandma is not as long as most feature films, but it makes good use of its time and the pace, while measured, never lags or loses your interest. You quickly become immersed in Elle and Sage's situation and in their lives. The film has a very intimate feel to it but avoids being sentimental, showing that family is often a prickly complex thing. And that there's a lot of truth to the poet Robert Frost's famous observation ""Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.""

Highly recommended.",1450396800,49,4139,4.738525730180807
7569844,5,B019C6X02M,I saw this in theaters more than once. It is such a good movie and Lily Tomlin is freaking amazing in it! I highly recommend it!,1450137600,4,128,3.9615384615384617
7569845,4,B019C6X02M,"""Grandma"" (2015 release; 82 min.) brings the story of Elle (played by Lily Tomlin). As the movie opens, we get Chapter 1 ""Endings"", in which we see Elle breaking up with her (much younger) girlfriend Olivia. ""You're nothing but a footnote"" sneers Elle. But after Olivia leaves, crushed by Elle's comment, we see Elle crying in the shower. Then Elle's granddaughter Sage stops by unannounced. It's not long before we learn that Sage wants to terminated an unwanted pregnancy and she needs $630, and can Grandma help? Can she ever! At this point we are not even 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is a labor of love from Paul Weitz, best known for co-directing American Pie and About a Boy. Here, he writes, produces and directs a small movie (with an even smaller budget) about a grieving lesbian who gets an opportunity to help her granddaughter. As probably many of you, I had heard the buzz about Lily Tomlin's first lead performance in decades, and indeed this lives up to the billing as Tomlin brings an unforgettable performance. That said, what I wasn't expecting was the at times mean and bitter undercurrents in this film. When Sage tells Grandma ""you have an anger problem"", Elle replies ""no, I have an a$$hole problem"", wow, seriously? In fact, besides the charming Sage (played by up-and-coming Julia Garner), there aren't many likable characters in this film, and neither will you walk away from watching ""Grandma"" with a feel-good moment, even as we learn more about Elle's past life and relationship in various conversations. Check out the pivotal scene played between Lily Tomlin and Sam Elliot (no worries, I won't spoil). Second, the movie is divided in 6 chapters, similar to book chapters. Third, there is a very nice musical score for the movie, courtesy of Joel P. West, and also a bunch of great song placements (Angus & Julia Stone, Over the Rhine, etc.). The soundtrack is available here on Amazon.

Bottom line: while I enjoyed the movie, in particular for Lily Tomlin's towering performance, I was slightly taken back by the harsh, if not mean, exchanges among many of the characters. The movie opened in late September here in Cincinnati. The evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (for a week night). Not sure why it's taken this long to finally get a DVD/Blu-ray listing on Amazon. All that aside, I encourage you to check out ""Grandma"" on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1450051200,12,2603,4.808035714285714

7569907,5,B019C6X02M,"Grandma is a dark comedy.  While the subject of abortion is obviously not comedy, the film writers did a tremendous job dodging that issue and making the characters and story memorable so as not to put too much focus on abortion.  With that said I wouldn't blame anyone who had a problem with abortion being used as the central theme.

Want to talk about an actress who was exactly right for a role?  That would be Lily Tomlin!  She plays an outrageous, offensive call-it-like-it-is grandmother towards everyone she meets!  Kind of reminds me of Wanda Sykes but perhaps even more offensive.  When her granddaughter shows up one afternoon (Julia Garner) pregnant and begs for money to abort her pregnancy (over 600 bucks!) well Lily doesn't have the money so the two find themselves going on an adventure around town meeting old friends, friends and sexual partners in an attempt to find enough money for the procedure.

I think the movie is kind of deceiving in the very beginning.  We see Lily acting incredibly mean to her much younger girlfriend (Judy Greer's character) and calling Judy nothing but a footnote.  This makes Judy very upset so she walks away angry.  This scene gave off the impression that this would be the type of movie similar to Osage County.  You know, a mother or grandmother acting WAY out of line and downright ignorant to her family causing nothing but a giant headache for everyone, however after this opening scene Lily is portrayed as someone's who's actually over the top, honest and very funny.

How about the way Lily beats up Julia's boyfriend?  LOL!  Takes a hockey stick and smacks it right on the boys knuckles (though based on the angle it looks like she smacks him in another spot!)  Nat Wolff plays the take-no-crap boyfriend... only to end up on the floor crying after the beating Lily gives him.  Go grandmom!  She also grabs a bag of weed from the boys sock drawer.  I had a feeling when Nat revealed where he's hiding some money that either dirty magazines or drugs would be brought up.  Sure enough.

From here Lily and Julia go around town to try and get the abortion money.  They visit the restaurant where Judy works, but that backfires in a big way as the librarian wouldn't give Lily the 500 dollars she asked for (even though Lily knew the books were only worth 50 bucks).  Next destination- the tattoo parlor.  One of Lily's old friends (Laverne Cox) couldn't return a favor because she's broke as well.

In comes perhaps my favorite moment of the movie- when Lily and Julia visit Sam Elliott (and he *still* has that deep dreamy voice- oh how I feel like fainting!)  Turns out Lily and Sam had a relationship at one time, and while it looked like the two were on the verge of getting along just fine and moving on from any issues that happened in the past, Lily wasn't able to get the money from Sam because he demanded that Lily make out with him.  She refuses, and that changes the complexion of the visit in a big way!  Sam also gets offended when he demands to know what the money is needed for.

Next... let's visit mom (played by Marcia Harden).  She's absolutely furious over her daughter's actions and can't believe the pack of 100 condoms Marcia gave Julia wasn't enough to stop her from getting pregnant.  I'm surprised Marcia didn't fall off the treadmill desk she was riding, lol.  This is the one person Lily's actually nice to.  After this comes the abortion clinic.  Hilarious scene when a woman protesting against abortion has a young daughter who smacks Lily in the eye when Lily says to the girl ""There's a world beyond narrow mindedness"" or something to that effect.  Her black eye is a theme throughout the movie.  She's a tough lady and doesn't need treatment!  Makes me wonder if those against abortions are allowed to protest outside the building.  I really don't think they are.  You really can't harrass someone walking into the building!  Bad enough they're an emotional wreck as it is.

Anyway I won't say whether the abortion actually occurs or not, but I really think Grandma is a top notch movie in terms of writing and characters.  While Lily might appear like a mean old grandmother, she became that way based on a long life of several experiences with people (many whom we meet throughout the movie).  Julia Garner perfectly plays the role of a ditzy teenage daughter who doesn't know any better, and Marcia being a semi strict mother always too busy attending meetings to bother raising her daughter is another fine element to the story.  The ending is fitting too.  Really excellent movie overall.",1471305600,,4586,4.670411985018727
7569908,3,B019C6X02M,"Love to see Lily, her character was broadly drawn and without a plot to back her ( and the others) , this movie failed.  Having been a woman of child bearing age in  the 70s, I was not much entertained  by the discussions of abortion in today's world or the past.  The terror of an unplanned pregnancy , no money and little support was very realistic, and hasn't changed in 45 years  I may have expected more humor, and I realize now, there is hardly a way to make pain, loss and redemption, funny.  I bought my copy of this movie,because I knew I would want to see Lily's genius over and over...no matter what the rest of the movie might do. I suggest you do the same.",1471132800,,669,4.1875
7569909,5,B019C6X02M,"GRANDMA is that strange type of film that is at one humorous, sensitive, philosophical, and speeds through a fast paced day in the life of the differences and similarities between the aged and the young. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Being Flynn, In Good Company, Mozart in the Jungle) and employing a cast of immense talent, this film addresses many issues before the public today  same sex partnerships/marriages, abortions, mother/daughter relationships, aging, and more.  It is both entertaining and it works very well as a comedy drama  much like life.

Sage (Julia Garner) is a teenager who discovers she is pregnant and the boyfriend responsible shuns her and doesnt want to help her. Sage has a tense relationship with the mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) and cannot turn to her for financial assistance to pay for a scheduled abortion so instead she seeks out her lesbian maternal grandma Elle (Lily Tomlin) who is in the throes of breaking up with a young girl Olivia (Judy Greer) after recovering from the death of her 38 year relationship with her beloved Violet who had been as much a grandma to Sage as Elle has been. Elle relationship with Judy has been strained for years and Elle decides Judy would be the last source of borrowing for this particular project. Together Elle and Sage set out to find the money to pay for the evenings scheduled procedure and in the process they encounter old acquaintances (Elizabeth Pea, Sam Elliott and eventually crusty mother Judy) and the procedure is accomplished  and Elle has traversed memories of a life she does not regret.

So many fine moments of solid dialogue are interspersed with this road trip that make this film a very sensitive examination of mother/daughter/grandmother relationships. Tomlin, Harden, Elliott, Greer and Garner are all in top form. The ending, quiet and solitary, speaks fathoms about human sensitivity. Highly recommended.

I have a choice about what I watch, so if a movie offended me that much, I suppose I wouldn't take the time to finish it.  I don't know what all the fuss is about there, or what planet those people live on.

She is an academic who academia has forgotten about and is somewhat disgruntled with the World. Then her granddaughter turns up  this is Julie Garner as Sage. She has some life changing news and needs a quick fix of cash to sort things out.

The problem is Elle is more or less broke so, without losing heart, they start on a road trip to find as much cash as they can lay their hands on. On the way both women come face to face with their pasts and the life choices that brought them to this point in time and it is revelatory for both.

Now this is billed as a comedy and a lot of it derives from the sour comments and general bad behaviour of Elle. If you think old people being cranky has been done to death as a vehicle for comedy then best to give this a miss. I like it as it works on more than one level. The grumpiness belies a real person who cares, loves and has been through life and she keeps the scars hidden by the outward attitude.

7570015,4,B019C6X02M,"This is a small budget ($600,000, yes, $600,000) film with such big time talent as Lily Tomlin, Sam Elliott and Marcia Gay Harden.  Tomlin plays an aging lesbian poet who has lost her life partner and is just breaking up with that partners successor.  Her granddaughter appears at her door, in need of money to pay for the termination of her pregnancy.  In the course of the film Grandma and granddaughter travel from place to place and person to person, trying to raise the needed cash.  Grandma is acerbic, profane and funny; the process is seriocomic with some sad overtones.  Harden plays Tomlins daughter, granddaughter Sages mother.  She is semi-estranged from both, though the course of the narrative suggests that the connecting lines within the gene pool are clear.  Elliott plays an old flame.

The story is tight, engaging, sad at points, quite funny at points, and a quick watch at 79 minutes.  Tomlin was troubled by the profanity in the original script but apparently added more of it when the film was actually shot.  The film is scrupulously politically correct, but attempts to mute that fact by making its examplars and attitudes part of everyday lifes flow.

The most striking thing about the film is its almost-nonexistent budget.  The vintage 1955 Dodge driven by Tomlin in the film is apparently one of her own cars.  While the film is structured (in plot, cast and attitude) as a womans movie men should enjoy it as well.  I did.",1460678400,2,1452,4.80241935483871

There isn't a complicated plot or any action to speak of, but what it does have is an interesting perspective into human relationships and interesting characters. Lily Tomlin was the real standout as the acerbic Grandma of the title, but the actress who played her granddaughter kept up pretty well. Also look for Marcia Gay Harden and Sam Elliott in small roles. The film sticks to the mechanics of small, ""day in the life of"" indie movies and there isn't really a whole lot of earthshaking reveals, instead reveling in the smaller, intimate moments. There was nothing particularly groundbreaking here, but it was a well-executed comedy-drama with a very human, relatable story.

7570140,4,B019C6X02M,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Many will read the cover or description of this movie online and walk away from it, offended by the content and talking about politics and statements made by Hollywood without ever having watched the movie. As someone who leans right and believes in God Im included in a group that takes heat for my beliefs from those who are just as intolerant on the other side of the coin. So let me say something up front. GRANDMA is a good movie. Its a movie that should be seen and discussed with an open mind and all politics pushed aside.

The movie tells the tale of Sage (Julia Garner), a teenage girl who goes to her grandma Elle (Lily Tomlin) with a problem: shes pregnant, has scheduled an abortion for late that afternoon and needs the money to have it done. Elle is an aging poetry writer and college professor who has just broken off her romance with Olivia (Judy Greer). Yes that means shes a lesbian. Heads are spinning and tongues are already wagging based on the abortion and lesbian aspects of the movie. But hang on and stick with it rather than be offended.

Elle loves her granddaughter and would do anything to help her. The problem is she is broke. Debt free she paid off her cards and cut them up to make a wind chime. With no cash on hand she tries to figure out a way to get the $600 Sage needs to get the abortion done. So why does Sage go to her grandma for help instead of her own mother? It turns out that mom is not someone she wants to confront about this issue. But Sage isn't the only one who doesnt want to deal with her mother. Elle has no interest in doing so either. The dup hit the road in Elles mode of transportation, an old 1955 Dodge Royal that belonged to the love of her life Violet who has since passed away. The movie is spent as the pair try to find the funds while revisiting the past of Elle.

Their first stop is the young man who was part and parcel with Sages getting pregnant. A young slacker whose home has all the accoutrements of the type (plenty of pot, beer and game systems) claims he has no money for Sage and tries to lay the blame off on Sage. Not a smart thing to do with grandma on hand.

The pair move on to an attempt to sell some first edition books in Elles collection. The books are feminist tomes that were famous at one time and now nothing more than a memory of the past. They inspired many when they were new but have become forgotten to a younger generation that seems only interested in the present and themselves than anything else. Elles discussion of this fact reveals this truth while not harping on it.

From stop to stop, location to location, it keeps looking as if they will not make their deadline or raise the funds they need. One of the most dramatic scenes involves them visiting an old flame of Elles played by Sam Elliott. Elliott was a man that Elle was in love with at one time, someone she did wrong all those many years ago by leaving him as she discovered her true sexuality. That he is willing to even speak with her offers a tense moment. Where that discussion goes makes for more drama in a few minutes than many films have in 2 hours.

I won't reveal the end results here but things do come to a conclusion. But its not the abortion or the fact that Elle is a lesbian that are the centerpieces of this film. It is the interaction between a young woman and her elder. It is a love story that if you were to replace the characters with a man and a woman there would be no question or controversy involved, it would just be a love story that shows powerful feelings between two characters. The writing is such that if the controversial topics were replaced the movie would have had a huge following and garnered favorable attention from most movie goers. That it didn't get the attention except for critical acclaim is sad. There is a great story here as well as performances that touch the heart.

Some will not be able to set aside their beliefs long enough to watch this 79 minute film. It will be their loss. Rather than walk away from it entirely it could be a good starting place for a dialogue about the individual characters and their choices in life as opposed to a way to condemn or celebrate the things they represent. That would then open the door to discuss those things. Elle is not a common woman nor is she as simple as some would think. She is much more complex than most and deserves our attention. Beneath her rough exterior and caustic tongue is a woman who loved, a romantic at heart and a person who we can care for by the end of the film. All you have to do is take a chance and watch the film.",1456876800,6,4656,4.265005662514156

7570160,4,B019C6X02M,"Possible spoilers.  I really wanted to see this film when it first hit theaters, but tracking it down became a chore, so now I get a chance on Blu ray.  In a part written specifically for her, Lily Tomlin plays an aging lesbian.  Elle (Tomlin) is in the process of breaking up with her much younger partner, Olivia (Judy Greer, Ant-Man) for ambiguous reasons.  It is clear however that Elle still pines for her longtime partner who has died.

Out of the blue, Elles granddaughter, Sage (Julia Garner, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For), shows up at her front door.  Shes 10 weeks preggers and has scheduled an abortion for later that day.  But she needs $600 for the procedure and hopes to get it from Elle.  Sage doesnt want to go to her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and Elles daughter.  In fact she hopes to keep her in the dark.  Alas, Elle has just paid off all of her debt and torn up her credit cards, so has no money.  Let me just interject here that just because she tore up her cards doesnt mean she cant access the credit.  But lets just assume she doesnt know that.  Otherwise the film is over, making it even shorter than its crisp 80 minute running time.

My favorite scene is when Grandma and Sage go to visit Cam (Nat Wolff, Paper Towns), the one-time boyfriend co-responsible for Sages situation.  Elle wants half.  Cam says no.  The two get into a name calling event.  One that would make Republican presidential candidates proud.  Having had enough, Elle puts a smack down on Cam using his hockey stick for emphasis.  With this scene we are now aware of Elles proficiency to get down and dirty if need be.

The day trip continues in Elles cherry 1955 Dodge Royal Lancer (Tomlins own car by the way) where she tries to borrow, beg or steal money from friends and acquaintances including Laverne Cox as a tattoo parlor entrepreneur and the late Elizabeth Pena as a restaurant owner (and Olivias boss).  She even pays a visit to her ex-husband Karl (Sam Elliott) who she briefly married before running out.  They haven't seen each other in over 30 years.

The film was written and directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy and American Pie) who does a great job keeping the story moving along.  But this is Tomlins movie.  Shes in all the scenes, has a lot of dialog and certainly belies her 75 years.  The movie is a funny and poignant reflection of one persons life.  I loved it.

The Blu ray is nicely presented with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio consistent with the original theatrical production.  It looks terrific with excellent detail.  Check out the various close-ups as the camera moves from the clear fresh-faced Sage to the mature Elle.  Colors are excellent, bright and realistic.  Black levels are deep and true.  The audio comes via a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is also very good.  The film is dialog based but there is some action in the surrounds when music plays and in some of the exterior scenes.  It is mostly ambient sounds (birds, traffic, etc.) which give some realistic location information.  There are numerous subtitles to choose from including English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Mandarin and more.  Extras include an audio commentary track with Tomlin, Elliot, Garner and director Weitz as well as a making of piece, a Q & A with Tomlin, Elliot and Weitz, a trailer and some Sony previews.",1456790400,3,3367,4.5966386554621845

The women weren't so fun, but every man was either a cheap dogmatic (poor Sam Elliott), mean (the pathetic boyfriend. Couldn't he be confused and not capable like the Greer character?), or a low-life rip-off artist like the cab driver.  WHERE'S THE HUMOR?  There were no laughs in this movie.

7570316,5,B019C6X02M,"This worked on all the levels. The first thing that's apparent is this is not a comedy, not in the strict sense. It's a drama with heart and guts. Everyone delivers. Tomlin shines as a somewhat broken but still functioning senior who has an opportunity dropped in her lap by way of a granddaughter with a problem. Some people are not going to like this film because, frankly, the issues discussed and the way the problems are resolved are not going to please some people. What I liked was the humanity that seeps into every aspect of the story. For an example, Sam Elliot has a small but significant role where he plays the old, wounded lover. What's revealed deftly and effectively is a mixed bag of pain and resentment that is not all that evident from the initial meeting. If you love Elliot, you might not after this character portrait, or you might like him more depending on your mindset. He's proven over and over again that he can deliver and he does.
No more spoilers.
It's a short film, less than 90 minutes. However, it's full of character and not always easy to take character. It's still winning and sincere without being sappy or maudlin.

Her teenage granddaughter shows up in desperate need of $600 for an abortion but our heroine has just paid off those medical bills and is strapped for cash. This movie is about their quest for money in a vintage Dodge sedan.

Writer/director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"" and ""In Good Company"") has crafted the ideal vehicle to remind us what a perfectly splendid actor we have in Lily Tomlin (Oscar nomination for ""Nashville"").

His cast:
  * Lily Tomlin (""9 to 5"" and ""A Prairie Home Companion"") Elle has a checkered past. She is a poet and an educator, but the more we learn about her, the more surprises we find.
  * Julia Garner (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") is perfectly cast as Sage, that wayward granddaughter. Her boyfriend failed to bring her the money and now accuses her of lying about his involvement. Problem is, she has an appointment for the procedure and the clock is ticking.
  * Marcia Gay Harden (""Elsa & Fred"") Judy is mother of Sage and daughter of Elle. This is not an easy spot to be in!
  * Judy Greer (""The Descendants"") Olivia is unceremoniously tossed out of Elle's house and must go on with her life. Elle will NOT accept money from her!
  * Elizabeth Pea (""Lone Star"") Carla has the small store where Elle hopes to sell her first edition feminist books.
  * Sam Elliott (""I'll See You in My Dreams"") Karl is a last resort. Elle is pretty sure he will help but we are not prepared for some of their surprises. The scenes with Elliott and Tomlin are particularly good!

This has some predictable discussions about abortions, of course with Tomlin involved, they will be pro-choice (but watch that little girl outside the clinic). This satisfying movie is just over an hour long but isn't rushed; it earns its R rating because of dialogue and profanity.

I smiled over Sage's confusion between ""The Feminine Mystique,"" Betty Friedan's book and Mystique, the character in the X-Men movies.",1455235200,8,2148,4.613157894736842

I grew up watching Lily Tomlin  She is still edgy and funny and just downright cool.  The acting is good and the story is believable.

The movie itself is a great story about women's lives, motherhood, faithfulness, and growing old.  It's serious, but it has a lot of humor and humanity.

8744644,1,B019C6X02M,"I'm amazed that Lily Tomlin would get involved with such a piece of rubbish. She plays a totally improbable character--a poet and university professor with no money and no social skills who is rude and crude to everyone, and usually for no reason. I guess that's the sort of thing that passes for humor these days, but--no exaggeration--I laughed exactly once in the entire film. The granddaughter is a whining, pathetic little muddle-head. I was going to say that the movie would make good propaganda for the anti-abortion folks, but I suppose it's actually a good thing she got an abortion. She'd make a horrible mother.  Glad I checked it out at the library rather than spending any money on it.",1527033600,,698,4.768595041322314
