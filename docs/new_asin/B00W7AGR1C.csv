8712441,5,B00W7AGR1C,"Wow, wow, wow You will visit the best of National Mall in this documentary. The simple and over towering Washington Monument, the tallest man-made structure in the world when completed after 24 years of construction stop because of Civil War. Lincoln Memorial, an engineering feast since the whole mall is on a waste land so Lincoln Memorial had to be built like a modern-day skyscraper on stilts. Japanese Cherry Trees, where 100 of those beauties are almost over a hundred years old; twice the normal lifespan for trees. Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a simple wall with names which will bring you to tears unlike any other wall in the world. National Mall is United States of America at its best where American geniuses created a monumental place that brings the history of America together. A must see documentary as well as a good guide before your visit since in the documentary you will be able to go all the way down to the footings of the Lincoln Memorial where no other visitor is allowed to visit and see the concrete construction with all its graffiti. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1432598400,6,1081,4.786096256684492
