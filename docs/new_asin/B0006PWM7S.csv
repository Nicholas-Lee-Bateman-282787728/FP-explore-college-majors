8042193,3,B0006PWM7S,Oh. the thrill of it all! That's what W.S. Hart said in an interview long ago; this film takes you WAAAYYY back to when it all began.,1254182400,,133,3.962962962962963
8042194,4,B0006PWM7S,"This is quite a good DVD featuring the silent era's two greatest Western stars: William S Hart in the feature film, ""Wagon Tracks"" and G M Anderson, the first real Western star in a 2-reeler called ""Naked Hands"".  Both are powerful dramas with superb acting performances by both Anderson and Hart, and together they make this DVD great viewing.  G M Anderson became famous as 'Broncho Billy' in a staggering 350+ 1 and 2 reel films from the early 1900s to 1916, when William S Hart took over the reigns as the screen's Cowboy hero.  Although ""Naked Hands"" was originally made as a 5-real feature length film, it was later shortened to 2 reels, as presented here.  It is a sad and stirring little drama with some surprising and very good scenes, and despite many missing parts, this condensed version still packs a powerful punch.  It serves as a great introduction to the feature film, ""Wagon Tracks"" in which William S Hart is the expedition leader of a wagon train across the western deserts to Santa Fe.  Much more than just a story of pioneers braving the Wild West, ""Wagon Tracks"" is mainly about a murder, finding the real killer and serving justice.  The victim is expedition leader Hart's own younger brother whom he wanted to meet and escort to Santa Fe, but the actual events of the murder are covered up to appear as an accident.  Hart is very good in these emotional and dramatic scenes, and the story moves along at a steady pace with an interesting twist at the end when justice is done.  Some parts of this film reminded me of Paramount's 1923 production of ""The Covered Wagon"", and ""Wagon Tracks"" is of a similar high standard, even the picture quality on this DVD is very good overall.  There is also a nice bonus slide show of about 80 pictures, mainly color posters of Hart's many Westerns, as well as some nice portrait photographs.  All up, a good and entertaining DVD for lovers of good silent films, not just of Westerns.",1113177600,12,1944,4.605797101449276
