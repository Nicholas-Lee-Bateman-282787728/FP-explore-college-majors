That's why i give this 5 stars in my book. For laughter, directing, and for just being such glamerous people.",1024617600,4,261,4.822222222222222

That being said, French and Saunders always manage to create some funny sketches...but you can definitely tell this is their ""formative"" years as comidiennes.",979862400,3,280,4.9787234042553195
