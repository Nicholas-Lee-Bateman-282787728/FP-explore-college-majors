7810282,5,6301216628,"Marine Garnet Montrose was horribly disfigured in WW2 and  he returns to his Virginia home to pick up the pieces of his shattered life - yet refuses to see his prewar sweetheart Georgina. Garnet still loves Georgina, so he writes heartfelt letters to her an trusts a handsome young stranger to deliver them. He trusts too much. The drifter soon ignites a smoldering triangle of violent passions. This is the basic synopsis of the story. The story goes so much deeper and involves so many iterations of emotions with the cast. particularly Michael Biehn as Garnett....SENSATIONAL, Patrick Dempsey as Daventry....more that SENSATIONAL, and Michael Beach as Quinton.....VERY SENSATIONAL. there are so many underlying emotions with these 3 men that you are never sure where they are going. I will not say anything about the story or the ending but this is a love story on a myriad of levels. Why isn't this movie on DVD or Blu-ray???????",1462752000,,933,4.942675159235669
7810283,1,6301216628,"I recorded the original from PBS back in the 80's. It was a wonderful, touching story. In the last few years I thought it was time to replace the VHS tape for fear it would quit playing one day. The first one I bought was missing about 20 minutes vital to the story. I threw it away since it was worthless. I couple of months ago I decided to try again and bought another VHS tape claiming again in great shape and mentioned 93 minutes so I bought it. Was excited watching it and all of a sudden the story skipped to the very end. Again omitting about 20 minutes of very important dialog leaving anyone who had not seen the original in it's entirety totally confused and wondering what happened. One tape was missing about 20 minutes in the middle of the story the other 20 minutes at the end. Both totally worthless. There is a VHS tape being offered for around $50.00 claiming new and factory sealed but I'm very skeptical. Luckily I still have my original copy which I recorded off PBS but for how long anyone knows.",1401926400,2,1019,4.340314136125654
7810284,5,6301216628,I have not had the privilege of  reading the book. Books seem to be better so i will be ordering  the book next. This movie was so well done. I never know how it was going to end. Needs to be on dvd.,1391644800,,199,3.604651162790698
7810285,5,6301216628,"I love this film. It is a great movie of a great James Purdy novel. Michael Biehn is terrific as always, as is Patrick Dempsey and the rest of the cast. To bad this is not on dvd.",1380672000,,179,3.736842105263158
7810286,5,6301216628,"For too long some of James Purdy's work has been unavailable, either ignored or neglected, but surprisingly his novel In a shallow grave was made into a film, which surprisingly considering Hollywood standards it was translated to the screen with the characters retaining the same feelings and sentiments from the written words, of course there were some changes along the way, but it is still a movie worth watching. This movie should have had a wider audience, but as it is with serious films as this one, it does take someone willing to embrace it with an open mind. The viewer wiil have the opportunity of finding an excellent film and also discover what a wonderful writer James Purdy is.",1192752000,9,693,4.783333333333333
7810287,4,6301216628,"I believe this movie must be a gay theme. Still remenber how familer this was happened to me. One shy man can't say how much he loved the other. Sacrifice everything even his life...
Miss the feeling..",1076198400,,201,4.45945945945946
