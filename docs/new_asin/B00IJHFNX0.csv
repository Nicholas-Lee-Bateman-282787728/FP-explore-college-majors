8642581,4,B00IJHFNX0,"The Kevin Steen/El Generico feud was one of the hottest wrestling rivalries on the indie scene. Ring of Honor did a tremendous job of telling a story of these two former tag partners turned enemies. I am particularly biased toward ROHs showcase of this feud because I was in attendance for a few of their live events while this was going on, and I can tell you Steen and Generico are electric when paired together. It does not matter if it is a tag match, a hardcore-style match, or just a straight stare down, this is pro wrestling at its best. This compilation begins during their last few matches as a team all the way to their epic final showdown (at least final at that point in time). There are some amazing matches here, make sure you do not skip over the Steen/Corino vs Generico/Cabana matches as those are golden as well. The Steen/Corino vs Kings of Wrestling is also a hidden gem, but the final match on this compilation is a classic. It is one of the best pro wrestling matches I have ever seen. A bit hardcore at some parts, but the storytelling is off the charts.

Now this set does have some questionable content such as the first two tag matches which could have easily been omitted. Starting with the break up was the way to go if you ask me. Also the ROH world title match against Tyler Black seemed like filler, though still not bad. These could have easily been replaced by material that exclusively showcased the Steen/Generico rivalry. Several key segments from their feud were omitted such as a cage match between Steen/Corino against Generico/Cabana which aired on HDNet. I have no idea why they left that out. Besides those flaws, this set is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to those who lived it and those new to it. This is the perfect way to become acquainted with the history of these two wrestling personalities as Kevin Owens (formerly Steen) and Sami Zayn (formerly Generico) are beginning their feud again on NXT.",1422835200,,1957,4.591428571428572

ROH Tag Team Championship/Tables Match w/El Generico vs. American Wolves - It should be noted that this wasn't a typical tables match as the only way to win the way was through pinfall & submission but tables were legal to use as weapons.  Both teams started brawling immediately before the match officially started around ringside before settling in the ring with double teams trying to single out one of their opponents through double team tactics using the tables with some not breaking when bodies were thrown into them as both teams traded momentum putting not only their opponents but themselves through tables throughout the contest with the Wolves heavily focused on a body part of one of their opponents non-stop.

""Final Battle"" Dec. '09

vs. Colt Cabana - This was originally set to be a verbal confrontation with Colt apologizing for how Steen felt about him only for Steen to still attack & disrespect him using dirty tactics before he eventually hurt himself on the outside leading to Steve Corino to verbally & physically encourage Steen to continue to fight leading to a conflicted Generico getting involved as well confronting Steen for the first time since Final Battle as this match was more of a backdrop to continue to issues between all four men.

""Salvation"" July '10

Tag Team Chain Match w/Steve Corino vs. Colt Cabana & El Generico - Both teams started out attempting to use the chain to their advantage through either tugs of war & keeping their opponents close or as a weapon to whip & choke & beat on their opponents as well resulting in blood shed in the opening minutes as they continued to use wrap the chain around body parts or areas of the ring to make their regular offensive more impactful & brutal before they implemented more weapons as a chair & table on the outside with things really getting taken to the extreme when one team used the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" using their numbers advantage with one man actually crucified with the chains.

""ROH On HDNet"" Episode 82

""Career vs. Mask"" Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor Match vs. El Generico - Steen attempted the code of honor only for Generico to respond in a way that would have been typical of Steen followed by taking the fight to him on the outside along bringing in various weapons to beat on him to the point where Steen was busted open before Steen used his own blood as war paint using the ringside environment to his advantage including a frog splash onto Generico buried underneath the metal barricade sheets as both men traded throwing each other into a ladder & beating on each other in unique ways with a chair as the match just got more physical every minute with each man doing high impact offense in various areas around ringside that were cringe worthy with no one being safe that got in their way from their allies to any referee who didn't count to three on a pinfall attempt as you kept seeing ""deja vu"" throughout the match of everything both of these men went through throughout the year before the match finally ended in poetic justice.  This was definitely ""the war to settle the score"" that was not only very physical & violent but also told a great story bringing in elements of their past matches & encounters from their feud from the past year.
""Final Battle"" Dec. '10

Unfortunately I wasn't able to watch this feud & stage of Steen's career as it happened but watching it back on this DVD definitely makes me say that this was one of my favorite feuds of all time as the storyline just built over time, each match was different than it's previous one with a level of aggression & violence that matched the intensity you saw throughout the promos & non-wrestling interactions between all four men as well as seeing the evolution of Steen & Corino becoming not just ""bad guy wrestlers"" but evil heels that you rarely see in wrestling today.  In the end, I highly recommend this DVD set for not just fans of the names involved but for fans of physical hardcore wrestling as well.",1406246400,,12630,4.637013857845329
