8715480,3,B00X99BUZI,"A bit hit and miss with this release of curious German 1960's thrillers, plucked from the vaults by those thoughtful Retromedia folk.
The lesser of the two features ""Strangler of the Tower"" is a lame yarn featuring a bizarre cult (with characters dressed in costumes you might expect to see in an old Republic serial) committing nasty deeds as they seek revenge on those who stole jewels and desecrated a pagan temple. Sounds more interesting than it really is, this relatively short film has a good lead in Charles Regnier and for trivia nuts, ""Miss Austria"" of 1962 (Christa Linder) but suffers the indignity of having the German cast dubbed into American accents despite the obvious Scotland Yard inverstigation and London settings!
Far more satisfying is ""The Monster of London City"", based on a Bryan Edgar Wallace novel revolving around a Jack the Ripper theme.  It boasts a clever sub-plot of an actual Jack the Ripper play being performed on stage as similar type murders are terrorizing London's Red Light district.  No great work of art but with a solid story, sound direction by Edwin Zbonek and good use of wide screen photography by Siegfried Hold, some jazzy Martin Bottcher music and an attractive cast headed by Hansjorg Felmy and Marianne Koch, this little thriller more than holds our attention.  And thankfully, a more than decent dubbing job where the accents really do resemble the voices of old London town.",1465948800,3,1429,4.945833333333334

8715485,4,B00X99BUZI,"Good pair of West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace crime mysteries.  The stories are pretty much the same as all the others of this particular genre, someone wants an inheritance, lost their mind, wants revenge, or all of the above.  They are always based in fog-choked London or a spooky English country mansion or castle.  Both movies are typical, but entertaining.  The quality of the Retromedia DVD release is very good, the black-and-white picture quality of both films is crystal clear.  Highly recommended.",1443312000,12,522,5.317073170731708
