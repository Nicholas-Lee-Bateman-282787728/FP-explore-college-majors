8171628,5,B000MSDN40,"Just because this is done either in a chair or on a mat don't make the mistake of thinking it's a wimpy workout geared toward 85 year old nursing home residents.  You will need dumbbells plus ankle weights that can go around your thigh just above your knee.  First half is upper body, 30 minutes, second half is lower body 30 minutes.  High recommend -- nice set, good instruction, good form with exercises.",1402012800,3,407,4.5479452054794525
