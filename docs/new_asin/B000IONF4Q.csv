2661903,5,B000IONF4Q,"This is a wonderful resource for individuals getting ready for marriage.  It is also a great tool for for marriage preperation programs.  The discussions are very easy to understand, yet vital to a lasting marriage.

For married couples, this is a great way to strengthen you marriage.

If you have any questions about the Catholic views on marriage, this series will give you a firm foundation.

I know that I have learned a lot from the series.
Thanks to Anthony and the Road to Cana staff for a great series!",1205193600,,511,4.633333333333334
2661904,5,B000IONF4Q,"I was so happy to learn that this series existed and even happier when I finished watching.  Each episode filled me with wisdom and hope for the future.  I realized that my desire to get married was really a desire to have someone worship me and 'fit' into my life.  Watching this series gave me a much clearer understanding of the sacrificial gift of self involved in marriage and the great depth of the vocation.  I have great hope for the future and am so thankful to Anthony Bruno and the panel of experts interviewed on this series.  I found the theme song a bit cheezy, but by the end, after hearing it 14 times, my roommates and I were singing along!  I highly recommend this to single and married couples alike!",1194739200,2,719,4.409090909090909
2661905,5,B000IONF4Q,"I recomend this to anyone.  The teaching in this are what this world is missing.  This for any one who belives in God and looking for Grace in their lives.  Wonderful, uplifting and full of God's Grace.",1173312000,5,202,4.405405405405405
8147161,5,B000IONF4Q,"As Padre Pio said, ""pray, hope and don't worry.""  I would also add prepare.  Many of us don't know what a healthy relationship is and haven't seen it in practice. There is an epidemic of divorce in this country. We need to prepare for marriage--even prior to entering into relationships. This video series is excellent for marriage prep.",1406419200,,337,4.793103448275862
8147162,5,B000IONF4Q,"These 2 dvds with episodes on different topics are a great resource for single catholics, and for those in a dating relationship.  The variety of speakers keep the episodes engaging and the variety of topics keep it interesting.  The information is practical and easy to understand.  I watched the whole thing over a few days I was home sick and was inspired to work on my relationship and on myself. If you can watch a couple of episodes with your boyfriend or girlfriend--even better.",1235692800,,486,4.761904761904762
8147163,5,B000IONF4Q,"I'm very thankful for Road to Cana. I started watching it the very 1st day I got it in the mail and had to finish at least DVD 1. It's wonderful, enlightening. It really helps us to prepare for marriage. There're things that I just had an idea but never went into depth with them until I saw this series. Thank you again and all the wonderful priests and experts who participated. I'll recommend it for anybody who feels a vocation for marriage and even couples who are already marrried.",1211068800,,487,4.4222222222222225
8147164,4,B000IONF4Q,"I watched this as a returning single Catholic.  During the days I was viewing it, I found out my son and his live-in girlfriend were expecting.  The DVD helped me to cope.  It gives the Catholic point of view on dating, sex, marriage, children and love.",1205193600,,253,4.456521739130435
8147165,5,B000IONF4Q,"I love the different topic covered by this series and the perspectives of all of the different experts, be they priests or other religious or clinical psychologists. The series covers all different issues that singles may think about and gives a sound Biblical- and Tradition-based response to these issues. I highly recommend this series to any single Catholic who is interested in beginning his or her marital vocation.",1205193600,,421,5.205882352941177
8147166,5,B000IONF4Q,"I enjoyed ""Road to Cana"" because as a single person, that is the path we are on, moving in the direction towards the goal. We are on this road upon birth and particularly in this day, age, and culture, there is a great need for a revitalization in church teaching, particularly in the areas of sanctity of human life, which comes first from the area of sexuality and the virtue of chastity. There was psychological, emotional and spiritual relevance in the video by wise, holy and theologically mature persons, leding inspiration from the Lord to help guide us and provide practical plans and techniques, as well as clearer understandings of the gender differences, and the discernment process. Thank you, it was fantastic. I pray it is a blessing to all others who view it, and I pray that it is shared with those who have not a clue about the depth and beauty of Sacramental Marriage:)",1205193600,3,887,4.6923076923076925
8147167,2,B000IONF4Q,"While I found this DVD set to be interesting and thought provoking, I also found it to be rather limited in scope. For instance, in the entire set of DVD's there is not ONE married woman interviewed.  ALL the women interviewed or acting as hosts are single.  This is a serious limit on a product that proposes to help prepare Christians for marriage.  Any advice from women who were so hooked on their careers that they are still single is suspect, after all, if they know so much about marriage how come they are not married?

I think that while ""experts"" who are unmarried can be useful for their input based on their training, the most useful of the men giving advice were the MARRIED men who could boast some years of successful marriage.  But where were their wives?

I'm married and happily so, but it wasn't anything I learned in this DVD set that put me on the track for success in my marriage.  It was good advice from older women over the years who fell into two groups, the nuns up at Church and the rest were all participants in happy long term marriages whose daughters were all grown and in newer but successful marriages that put me in the right place to find my husband.

So while I did not hate this video--after all the men interviewed were priests and married laymen who seemed to be fairly clear on what is needed before marriage can take place--I resented the lack of the feminine voice of experience.

Sometimes, EXPERIENCE is essential.",1205193600,4,1459,4.517110266159696
8147168,4,B000IONF4Q,This is a very informative and inspirational video.  I watched it on my own and cannot wait to watch it with my fianc.  We are going to try and watch a new session each week.  This video discusses very relevant issues that will affect the modern day couple.  I have even given friends advice that I have heard from this video.,1205193600,,326,4.295081967213115
8147169,5,B000IONF4Q,"While I was engaged, my fiance and I watched the entire series and found it to be very good.  We would often have to stop the DVD and discuss what we had just seen and heard.  We both believed that it really helped our marriage preparation and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is going to be married.",1205193600,,301,4.172413793103448
8147170,5,B000IONF4Q,Every person considering marriage or living together should watch this series.  I gave it to my 20-something son and girlfriend.  Very powerful and thought-provoking.  Facilitates the kind of conversations you should have with a potential partner BEFORE you say I do.,1205193600,,267,5.463414634146342
