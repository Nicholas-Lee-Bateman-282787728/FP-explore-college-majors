5022283,5,B006W7L3TC,"I have been an avid execiser for over 30 years.  I am a Certified Aerobics and Pilates Instructor, so as you can imagine, I have bought many, many, many DVD and Videos over the years to keep up with the Industry and try to find fresh, new ideas.  As much as I ""loved"" certain ones for a while, I must say that this particular compilation of sculpting, cardio, weight training Yoga, Pilates, etc. is absolutely addictive.  The fact that you follow the program day-by-day, in order is a bonus.  I have not ""spoiled the surprise"" and viewed what lies ahead.  Each day I get completely lost in the programs.  They are well thought out, user-friendly, innovative and yes, have I mentioned they are addictive?  I haven't taken the ""day off"" yet!  It doesn't take a lot of time, you are not traveling to a gym, you are exercising on your own terms.  I truly can't wait to work the next days program.  The time literally flies and before you know it, you have just done a kick-butt program and it feels great! How often have we been in a class where after a few ""reps"" we are bored out of our minds?  I know I have.  If you like boring repetition, this is NOT the DVD for you.  The coupling of Fred and Liz is truly enjoyable.  The ""class"" set up gives the option to take it down or up a notch.  As I said, I have been exercising for over 30 years and just the fact that the muscles are being challenged in different sequences, different directions, completely caught off-guard with what the next move may be, makes this program well worth the effort and certainly well worth the price.  I believe that by the time you have completed the full 30 day program, your body will be ready to be challenged again starting at Week 1 - Day 1.  I can't be more enthused. :)",1335830400,203,1755,4.318042813455658
5022284,4,B006W7L3TC,"I love core fusion, and have been to classes, have other DVDs, and have a yogavibes subscription just for the CF classes.  I have seen results and enjoy them. This DVD is a nice way to combine several videos in short segments, and keep the variety. I did feel at times it was a little choppy since the DVD were spliced together.  For example, you might be following one modifier and then halfway through it changes and that person is no longer there.  Nothing too hard to follow, but it does move quickly.  The variety is a nice change of pace, and the menu is awesome and easy to customize to what you are looking for.",1334620800,8,619,4.310344827586207
5022285,5,B006W7L3TC,"There are times when repackaging videos works in your favor, and times that it doesn't.  I'm happy to say that it is worth it for 30 Day Sculpt! It is especially worth it at the cost when I bought it.  The one DVD was the same as just one of the previously released DVDs.

The DVD is set up by week so you have a choice of 5 weeks, and then each week is set up by day for 7 days (6 segments plus a recommended rest day during the middle of the week). Each week has a theme: Week 1 is Strength, Week 2 is Cardio, Week 3 is Strength, Week 4 is Cardio, Week 5 is Strength and Cardio.  Even though a week may have the same theme as another, the segments are different, or if they share some of the same ones, a different order.  I have worked out to all four videos in the past (some I own and some I check out from the library), but obviously their recommended order of days/weeks could make a difference. Therefore,  I'm going to come back in a month and let everyone know if it is better/the same as working out to the individual DVDs. At the very least I can reccommend this DVD right now based on having done all the workouts before individually.  They are awesome!  They are a mix of pilates, yoga, ballet, and strength with light weights.  In general I notice the most benefit from exhale core fusion in my legs and core.  I recommend any of the individual DVDs with segments on 30 Day Sculpt and for your money recommend this DVD, if you are purchasing only one.",1333411200,111,2299,5.792284866468843
5022286,4,B006W7L3TC,"First off, I love the 30-day concept. Each day incorporates two ten-minute segments from their other workout DVDs. Sometimes the transition is a little weird, but I never found it unbearable. The husband and wife team switch off on the workouts too, so it's nice to feel like I have two instructors. I like his instruction better than hers, but primarily because she moves into some poses that I am just not flexible enough to do. He seems to take it a bit slower, which makes me feel more successful. I'm on week 4 out of 5 now, and I can feel that this has definitely made me stronger (and maybe a bit more flexible too!). I plan to repeat once I'm through the 30 days.",1476230400,5,671,4.333333333333333
5022287,5,B006W7L3TC,Love the core fusion videos. I used to be in great shape - not so much anymore. And at my age now I thought these would be good exercises to do.  Get the basics first if you haven't been active for a while.  Awesome work out.,1476230400,5,225,3.869565217391304
5022288,5,B006W7L3TC,This is my favorite exercise DVD.  I like it so much that I bought it for two of my 30 something friends to help them get into shape too.  I am over 60 and find the exercises challenging but invigorating.  There are modifications included that make the exercises possible for people of all fitness levels.  The fitness level of anyone who uses this regularly will improve.,1475366400,2,372,4.590909090909091
5022289,5,B006W7L3TC,"Exhale Core Fusion 30 Day Sculpt is a set of 20 minute workouts done six days a week for six weeks. I used this as part of my summer rotation this year. Sometimes I only did the 20 minutes or used it as an add on for another workout. This helped to keep me in shape. I find it very hard to do intense workouts in the summer. I like Fred and Liz's teaching style.
The workouts are a fusion of yoga, stretch and Pilates. Some of the moves a very challenging. One of the most challenging is the ""round back flat back"" where you work your legs and core against the wall. Very hard. You will become toned if you do these workouts regularly. I liked these so much that I purchased five more of their DVDs. The core and legwork is outstanding.",1475280000,12,736,4.118055555555555

5022294,1,B006W7L3TC,"Had to write bc I think this is a dangerous video. Yes, it's choppy and boring and poorly planned, and I could ignore all that, but the moves are too fast without any cueing, and is setting people up for injury. I am an experienced exerciser, belong to a few gyms, and do my own dvd WO's at home, but this is the single worst exercise compilation I have ever tried. I am throwing it out.

5022297,4,B006W7L3TC,I love that the 5 weeks o this program are all pieces together for you for each day. Only issue is its very fast paced with very little description on how to do some moves correctly. If this was a persons first time doing yoga I would recommend one of their other DVDs to get started with probably more explanation of proper form but otherwise the ballet moves are tough and you can really feel it.,1462838400,,398,4.25
5022298,4,B006W7L3TC,"I like this one, and that's saying a lot because not only am I picky, but I have many workout dvd's and I consider myself an advanced exerciser.  There is a great variety of workouts in here, and I love the length because I can add them on to my regular cardio or strength training with weights while staying efficient with my time.  The ab work on a couple of the sequences is especially challenging,  I wouldn't say the cardio should be used as an end-all, be-all to cardio, since it has been found that short bursts of high intensity are what benefits the heart the most, and this does not have that.  The heart rate does get elevated, but not enough to make it your sole means for cardio work.",1461801600,3,697,4.297709923664122

I am a beginner to yoga, but it had more than just yoga in it so it was perfect for me. They use stretch bands, yoga mat, a chair, and yoga blocks.",1447372800,2,430,3.7362637362637363

5022308,4,B006W7L3TC,"A good video.  I like how it paces you each day for a month, including suggesting rest days.  And I like that they offer options during each exercise for those who aren't as strong or flexible.  I would love to look like the cover model, but the daily workouts don't seem to be long enough to feel a difference in my muscles.  I wish they'd add one or two more exercises per day.

5022310,5,B006W7L3TC,"The post by Christina (3 star review) is actually true, however, let me tell you my experience with it.

Just a few details - I am age 29, 5'5"", 190 Ibs, moderately active and live in an carpeted apartment. For this workout I use a yoga mat, two blocks, two 3 Ibs weights, and sometimes a yoga belt/strap at some point in these videos. I have them all handy within my workout area at all times.

Like Christina said, this 30 day sculpt is a set up on the disc by weekly workouts (5 weeks total), within each week are six days worth of 20 minute workouts (one day of rest), in each day there are two 10 minute workouts. They do repeat some workouts in other weeks, but there are enough videos that I don't feel I ever get bored or feel it's repetitive. I like this set up because you get to learn each one better and catch on to the moves quickly. And they do move quickly between each video. They also rotate a week of strengthening and a week of cardio throughout.

I keep pushing myself to do the best I can and learn how to adjust my posture better with each video. I would say this is not a beginner workout, and there are still a couple I have a hard time with. I had some knowledge of yoga poses before beginning; it will challenge you, but once you learn all the videos you will know what is coming. They do have someone modifying each pose for those that need a break or can't do the full posture yet. To be honest, I hate brick days, lol, but no pain no gain, and there are only a couple. Sometimes I can't do the full posture, but I do a lot of them and always finish each set 100%. I go as far as I can and sometimes I am somewhere in between the modified posture and the full posture. Do your best to learn each pose and strive to finish it completely and I promise it will pay off.

Usually after two weeks I'm already feeling amazing! I feel stronger, and more flexible than ever! It is by far my favorite workout video (I have at least 15 different kinds and counting). Sometimes I'll take a break and do something else, but when it doesn't yield the same results I am always running back to this one. It makes me feel like there are quick results and I have increased confidence because of it. This is usually the only workout I do as well...trust me it's hard to do anything else after this one, but it would be great paired with other activities like swimming or elliptical.

I picked this DVD up on a whim at Best Buy, I like going by days and 30 sounded like a lot. I am an Amazon-a-holic, so even though I didn't purchase it here I still wanted to rate it because I'm so happy with the purchase. In fact, I think I bought it 3 years ago, if that tells you something! 

Anyway, I feel it gives me a lot for $12 and if you are someone who likes to push their limits, I say buy it!",1440547200,37,2799,4.087431693989071
5022311,4,B006W7L3TC,"This is my second DVD for Core Fusion I've purchase and I really like the workouts. They are (mostly) easy to follow and give me a great workout. The 20 minute sessions are easy to fit into my busy schedule and I feel great afterwards. I haven't seen much weight loss (5 pounds is all) but I have noticed my body overall just feels better.

I listened to other reviewers who said that out of nowhere they needed a wall to lean against or chair or some other prop for the exercise, so I just made sure to have all that around during my exercise.

If you're not used to yoga poses, it may take a little getting used to. I would recommend watching a few of the sessions first to get a feel for how they do things.

The only thing I don't like (as others have mentioned) is that since it's a compilation of other workouts the segment will just begin and I have no idea what equipment I will need and I have to pause it and go find what I need.

5022367,5,B006W7L3TC,"I am one and a half weeks in to the 30 day sculpt and I'm really surprised at the effectiveness of just a 20 minute workout.  For about a month and a half before starting this I was going to the gym three to four times a week for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.  I was doing both weights and cardio.  I would feel exhausted, sweaty and spent after my workouts but it was time consuming.  I travel 20 days a month so wanted something that I could do in my room.  The reviews of this dvd were good so I got it.  I thought I was in shape!!  Each 20 minute section gets me into a good sweat and has my muscles shaking.  I love it!

My only suggestions if you buy the video:
- Do your own stretching before you start each workout.  With the intensity of the moves they do you can hurt yourself if you're not limbered up.
- This is not a beginner video.  My 72 year old mom wanted to buy it when I was telling her about it but I recommended she not, it's too intense.  If you're way out of shape this will be too much.
- It's most beneficial for people who already know basic yoga moves.  There are technical moves that you need to go in and out of quite quickly and if you're not correctly aligned (from proper training) you will hurt yourself.
- Have weights (2 x 5lb) handy as you will need them for several of the workouts.  You will also need a chair for one of the workouts, blocks for another and space to sit along a wall for other ones.  They don't tell you about this before you start.

The instructors are great.  Very clear on instruction and motivating.  And who can beat a 20 minute workout?  I'm going to start it again once I'm done the 30 days, it's perfect for my busy travel lifestyle!",1378080000,5,1707,4.01186943620178

I found it to be irritating that there was no list of required accessories preceding each segment. So I had a choice to either assemble my weights, yoga band, yoga blocks and/or a chair for every segment, or scramble around in mid routine to get my stuff as I needed it! A momentary listing of stuff required for that segment listed at the beginning of each day's routine would save time and stress.

5022390,4,B006W7L3TC,"I learned about this video through a magazine and was really excited to have 30 workout sessions for such a low price. After reading reviews, I took a chance.

First off, don't expect 30 different sessions. The video is broken down into ""weeks"" (5 weeks, 6 sessions each). There is about 12 different sessions total, mixed & matched throughout the 5 weeks.

Also, as another reviewer mentioned, each 20-minute video is divided into two 10-minute segments. Which means keep your remote handy. They are not cohesive at all, usually the second 10-minute section begins in a totally different position with totally different props than the first half.

Despite these setbacks, I have enjoyed the videos so far. It is fast-paced, energetic, and largely yoga based. If you've never done yoga, or you consider yourself highly inflexible, I would advise you NOT to get this. The instructors expect you not only to know the moves (where to place hands, feet, etc.) based on the name of the pose (downward dog, half moon, reverse warrior, etc.) but they also switch between moves rather quickly. I would imagine that being a very frustrating thing for beginners.

I also don't recommend this for anyone with serious injuries because of the speed and whole body movements incorporated into all the sessions.

I give it 4 stars because I think it's a good workout. It keeps my attention, I am out of breath by the end of the first 10-minute segment, and I can do it within the comfort of my own home. Plus, it's pretty cheap. I suspect that's the most I can expect from a workout video.

Insanity wasn't my favorite but I LOVED P-90X....my body just can't handle it.  My 8-pack abs were amazing though.  Anyway....after I gave up those workouts I started running.

5022395,1,B006W7L3TC,I was excited about this DVD after the positive comments I saw.  I though it would be more about stretching (Yoga and Pilates) than what it is.  It just jumps into moves without any explanation and is too fast paced.  You can't take your eyes off this video which makes it hard to do the actual moves they want you to do.  The movements just aren't explained well at all.,1358208000,9,371,4.257142857142857
5022396,4,B006W7L3TC,"I really love the Core Fusion workouts, and this DVD is no exception. I love how the segments are put together, giving you a different emphasis every day. It's very nicely balanced, and I have had sore muscles in different places every day since I started using it (almost two weeks now). The 20 minute segments are great because you almost always have time to fit them in.

However, I do have some complaints. For equipment, the DVD case says you will need ""light weights and a mat"", and that's true. However, that's not all you'll need. At various times, you'll also need yoga blocks, a high-backed chair, and easy access to an open wall. You might also want a yoga strap for stretching if you aren't super-flexible. These all would be nice to know before beginning a workout so that you can have these things at the ready.

My other complaint regards the modified moves. They do always indicate that one of the students in the background will be doing modified moves, but the camera doesn't always focus on this person, so you don't always know what the modification is. Also, if you aren't very flexible, some of these moves will be challenging. One section requires you to be in pike position - even for the modified pose. I personally can't do that, and it would be nice to have some sort of modification for those who are less flexible. Overall, you need to be careful doing those moves. If you can't do them yet, find an alternative that is more at your pace for that section. You'll still get a lot out of the DVD, even if you aren't up to the level of the instructors.

Bottom line: This is a great workout DVD and well worth the price! Be aware that you may need to purchase some extra things in order to get the full benefit of the workouts, though.",1357776000,10,1761,4.445820433436532

OMG it may not seem like you're always busting your tush during the workout, but I feel the impact later and it's awesome! Each workout is the perfect length of time, I only wish there were smoother transitions between someone of the movements (editing flaw) and that they'd give you a heads up if an upcoming move required weights or a chair or whatever.",1357344000,5,555,4.398058252427185

Every day brings something different, so there's never a chance to get tired of the same workout day and day out.  I highly recommend the Core Fusion system and this is definitely the best of the lot.  Results are amazing.",1356307200,,366,4.402985074626866

even though it's only 20 minutes i was feeling the muscles working and pleasantly surprised at exercises i'd never done before...all in all the next day i was feeling it.
i would recommend watching the routines first since they just START!  none of the ""materials you will need""  i would also do a little warm up of my own and cool down as well altho it's not THAT strenuous.",1355011200,2,656,4.45

This summer I had surgery followed by bronchitis leaving me twelve weeks with no exercising.  I was looking for something to gradually return to fitness when I saw Exhale: Core Fusion 30 Day Sculpt.  It was just what I needed. Twenty minutes was perfect because it was all I could handle in the beginning.  After a couple of weeks I added ten minutes of walking/jogging.  I was pleased to see how quickly my muscle tone returned.  I would recommend this product to anyone at all levels of fitness.  The routines help to improve balance, core strength, musdcle tone and some cardio -for my heart was beating fast and hard at times. I would receommend adding cardio to your workout when you feel ready.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exhale-Core-Fusion-30-Day-Sculpt/dp/B006W7L3TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exhale: Core Fusion 30 Day Sculpt</a>",1350000000,17,985,5.47682119205298

5022413,3,B006W7L3TC,"I don't know why no one mentioned how disjointed the workouts on this DVD are. Each 20 minute workout is actually two 10 minute segments from other DVDs. This isn't necessarily bad, but the way it's put together is terrible. There is no warm up or cool down and it doesn't tell you what you are going to need for each workout. It just starts. For example, you start the workout needing weights and a mat for the first 10 minutes, then, all of a sudden with no pause, you switch to the next 10 minute workout which requires you to have your back up against a wall with your mat. You end up having to pause the DVD and scramble to get prepared for the next workout. This could have been easily avoided by just listing what you need for each 20 minute workout at the beginning. After the first week of workouts I got fed up with this constant changing so I can't rate my results.

I exercise regularly anyway, so I just wanted to add a little extra on days I can't make it to the gym. I'm at the gym at least 4 days a week for yoga and pilates, so I can't say that the workouts on this video were very difficult. It probably would be for someone who is not as familiar with yoga postures. The intensity is at a good level, not too easy, not too difficult. My only problem with this DVD is the lack of thought that went into putting it together. I'll probably give it another shot just because I have it.",1338076800,202,1400,4.147058823529412
5022414,5,B006W7L3TC,"These workouts are led by Fred DeVito & Elisabeth Halfpapp & are of the barre/yoga genre. This DVD is comprised of segments from 4 previously released Core Fusion DVDs--Lean & Toned, Bootcamp, Energy Flow Yoga, & Cardio-Pure Intensity. This program is set up as a 5 week program, with six 20 minute workouts per week. Each 20 minute workout is comprised of two 10 minute segments. There are 18 segments in total, breaking down as follows: 4 segments from Lean & Toned--upper body tone & stretch, thighs tone & stretch, flat/round back tone & stretch, & gluteal tone & stretch; 4 segments from Bootcamp--cardio flex, cardio sun salutations, jump backs part 1, & jump backs part 2; 5 segments from Energy Flow Yoga--energy flow, sun salutations part 1, sun salutations part 2, chi gong & hip opener stretches, & core & gluteal; & 5 segments from Cardio-Pure Intensity--energy moves, cardio flow, power flow, power sweat, & cardio curl.

I followed the program completely, doing the 20 minute Core Fusion workouts six days per week for five weeks. I'm so proud of myself because I never do rotations.  In addition, I kept up with my cardio doing elliptical usually 60 minutes 5 days per week. I did only a couple other workouts during my rotation, & I was doing all the cardio for months before. Therefore, my results were pretty much from just adding in the Core Fusion. As far as my results go, my midsection feels much more pulled in & looks more toned. My butt has lifted some. My thighs are slimmer. I can even do a few (up to 4 or 5) full pushups, & I could never do a full pushup before--I attribute this to all the planks & down dogs! I even lost a couple pounds, without really changing my diet. I was quite out of shape in terms of strength prior to this, as I had mainly been focused on cardio, doing only a couple yoga/pilates workouts per week. I am very pleased with my results.  It's amazing what adding in a short 20 minute daily workout can do for your fitness!",1337558400,28,1975,4.526610644257703

I agree that results will not be so extreme just using this on its own, so I am using this in conjunction with either 30 minutes of high resistance elliptical or 45 minutes on the treadmill 6 days a week. I love that by the time my muscles are shaking, the next section is starting. Everyone has 20 minutes a day to do something awesome for their body!",1506211200,,647,3.9846153846153847

I'm on week 2. My only beef is that the barre portions (round back and the ones up against the wall are extremely difficult to do at home. I spent 6 months doing barre workouts at a studio in my town, and I've found you really need the barre for the seated, round back core work.
