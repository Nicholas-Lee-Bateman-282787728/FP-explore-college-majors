6228735,1,B00HV48HB2,"I was very disappointed about the movie. When I got the movies, The Rainmaker didn't work at all and the Pelican Brief only played half the movie. I sent it back and a new one came right away. This time I was able to watch the Rainmaker without problem, however, the Pelican Brief played only half way. I sent it back. A new one came right away. Rainmaker didn't play at all and Pelican Brief only played half way. I sent it back and asked for a refund.",1419379200,3,453,4.159090909090909

8636265,1,B00HV48HB2,"The Rainmaker disc played out perfectly. However The Pelican Brief disc at approximately half way through just stopped. After inspecting the disc I tried again and had the same result. I then sent a message to the seller about the disc who came back with the answer that as they were not the manufacturers of DVD, there was little they can do about it. First of all this was a used disc not new as there were finger prints on the disc and the packaging and condition of the cover was worn. In my search for a replacement on Amazon I came across some customer comments on other vendors that had experienced the same problem with The Pelican Brief DVD. Some of the comments had indicated that the vendor had failed to disclose that this film was split in half on the DVD, 1st half on side 1, 2nd half on side two. What made me and other customers think that we had a fault disc is that there is no indication at the end of the 1st half to continue on side 2. Furthermore the vendors had not seen fit to make this known in their item sale on Amazon. There appears to be a number of people who returned their discs thinking they had a damaged disc when in fact the did not. Having known that this disc was formatted in this way, I would not have made the purchase. This is the second DVD of this film I have purchased and the 1st one had a similar format, which I thought was an error and it was only after checking the 1st disc that I found that it had 2 sides. This is the first Movie that I have ever seen formatted on 2 sides and I have a collection of close to 150. The reason for my 1 star is for the failure of the vendor to disclose this information and this is a bad formatting technique by the manufacturer.",1515628800,2,1713,4.131736526946108
8636266,1,B00HV48HB2,Seller did not mention in description that the movie Pelican Brief is 2 sided. Half of the movie is on one side the other half on the other.,1512777600,,140,4.035714285714286
8636267,1,B00HV48HB2,"Love the movie, but the DVD with The Pelican Brief is messed up. It was burnt on the DVD incorrectly. The first 1:17:00 is on one side, and the rest of the movie is on the flip side. There is residue of a price label sticker on the front, which brings me to believe Walmart or Best Buy knew the problem, sold them to a liquidator, and now are sold on Amazon.",1507334400,,358,3.986111111111111
