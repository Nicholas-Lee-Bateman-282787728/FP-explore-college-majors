The DTS encoding is superb and the Lfe channel made my couch move a few feet to the right.  And I can't forget Norika Fujiwara, she is one of my favorite foreign actresses, not to mention the fact that she is gorgeous (sharing the level of beauty with Shu Qui and Zhang Zhiyi)--and she is outstanding in this movie, you can't take your eyes off of her.",1004227200,5,711,4.378787878787879

Synopsis (taken from back): Two young and handsome cops Darren and Alex watch the charity event, and suddenly an assassination occurs.  Alex follows the assassin and suspects the beautiful woman, Norika, with move of taking something off from the victim's jacket pocket.  Actually, she's a Japanese interpol agent.  Darren and Alex try to save Norika who is trapped, but in the midst of the bullet showers, Alex dies heroicall.  Darren on a quest to save Norika and revenge for Alex, he pursues them relentlessly and defeats the gang in a high-octane action sequence involving helicopters, and fights on a large glass plane...
**I know the translation is bad, but that is what is written on the back cover.**
I have to say the fight sequences are well choreographed.  Mark Dacascos looks great, Coolio does a passable job of the typical ghetto gangster, Aaron Kwok has improved in acting and his mandarin, the other actors performed well also.  There is a great deal of English dialogue but it does not detract from the movie.
I am sure that audiences will really enjoy the helicopter fight sequence as well as the fight on the large glass pane fifty stories in the air...
I hope this was helpful.",997920000,10,1307,4.786666666666667

7945693,4,B00005MKM0,"Imagine you're a famous actor named Matt. You've played your Toms, your Harrys, your [Richards], and occasionally you've even played a Matt too. But since Matt is such a common name, no film-goer breaks out of their reverie to say ""Oh, man, that's his actual name!"" when another character says it. Now imagine you're rapper Coolio, playing alongside actors whose English is probably not their first language. You're a drug dealer bringing the `hood to a drug-free Chinese town schemed over by father-defying Mark Dacascos. You kill henchmen for the fun of it. Your character's name? Coolio. This... is China Strike Force, a typical action movie that delivers one helluva finale.

Using Coolio's ""real name"" is a hilarious choice: during scenes in which all seriousness abounds, hearing ""Maybe Lau's friend Coolio doesn't understand the Chinese?"" or ""Coolio! How about a drink before you go?"" sent us into uncontrolled giggles. Alternatively, maybe that's what Rumble in the Bronx director Stanley Tong intended, as there's a number of other verbal and visual gags throughout the plot-filled but event-less middle.

The endcaps, as in most action movies, are where the big thrills lie. For China Strike Force, it's mostly Jackie Chan-style fast fighting with your requisite flourishes (impromptu props, sleeves ripping off, partner-based super-moves, etc.), some decent moving vehicle stunts, and a chase scene between a Lamborghini and an F1 racer. Incidentally, I note ""death by blunt force trauma"" but what I really mean is ""Death by being slammed into an ancient Chinese temple while on top of a Lakers-colored Rolls Royce being carried around by a helicopter.""

The finale earns the film additional stars. Coolio and the male lead (Aaron Kwok) are suspended hundreds of stories in the air on a teetering glass platform about 10 feet by 20 feet. The camera zooms around and over them, showing no apparent safety nets. Every move sends the platform tilting in one direction, causing frantic hands-on-glass sounds as they're sent sprawling precariously over the edge. Down falls the female lead, now three on the glass, fighting space at a premium, metal whining, always tilting, always scrambling. I believed this scene, and it only became more amazing when I remembered that Coolio (Coolio!) was front-and-center fighting for his life too.

One of my tougher criteria for whether a movie is ""good"" or not is if I'd happily watch it again, and China Strike Force falls into that category. The ending is so strong that it rewards the wait, overriding any of the perceived downtime throughout the rest of the film. Well... ok, that and the scene where a naked Dacascos and Coolio watch Norika Fujiwara striptease and then Dacascos makes a Well-Endowed Black Man joke. ooOOo eEEee, Coolio likes girls indeed.

Death by: 1, 2, 3, 4: gun; 5: spike, neck punctured; 6: gun; 7: sword; 8: spear; 9, 10: gun; 11: blunt force trauma; 12, 13: explosion; 14: fall from great height. Sleaze by: 1: thongs, breasts, see-through; 2: breasts, see-through; 3: striptease (unfulfilled).",1314057600,,3070,5.132
7945694,3,B00005MKM0,"""China Strike Force"" is a solid representation of Hong Kong's fledgling 'Gen-X' era: its stars were lifted from the pop scene rather than Chinese opera schools, its gweilo villains are internationally known and not limited to mere henchmen status, and the movie's production values are much sleeker than the dozens of Hong Kong cop movies that came before it. Basically, it feels like the entire film was produced with a predominantly western audience in mind and was - amazingly - shot in English as well as Mandarin. However, this catering to international appeal likely turned off Asian audiences and the simultaneous release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>&nbsp;more or less hogged any potential fanbase it might have attained in the west. Still, it's a good movie for those of you wishing to see a newer face than Chan's or Li's, so don't let this one's obscurity throw you.

The story: when a huge drug-smuggling campaign is brought to China by an ambitious Triad heir (Mark Dacascos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>) and an American gangster (rapper Artis ""Coolio"" Ivey), it's up to security leaders Darren (Aaron Kwok,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Storm-Riders/dp/B002E2QH2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Storm Riders</a>) and Alex (Leehom Wang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lust-Caution/dp/B0010SAGHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lust, Caution</a>) to team up with a Japanese Interpol agent (TV star Norika Fujiwara) to expose both the actions of the criminals and those of their peers allowing it to happen.

With the legendary Stanley Tong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumble-in-the-Bronx/dp/0780619331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumble in the Bronx</a>) directing and supplying action choreography, it was for certain that this film would be commendable for its fight scenes, and for the most part, what's there is pretty good. Kwok and Wang may be easy to pigeonhole as pop-singing pretty boys, but the smooth camerawork shows that it's clearly them doing the majority of their own fighting, wirework, and even some of the stunts. Coolio, on the other hand, brings a lot to the film in terms of personality and is seen at least taking a punch gamely enough, but his two fight scenes are clearly being performed by a stunt double (thankfully, it's an actual black performer and not an Asian fellow in a wig). Dacascos, henchman Ken Lo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Drunken-Master/dp/B000056VOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Drunken Master</a>), and assassin Benny Lai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Story-2/dp/B000KX0IMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Story 2</a>) add a sense of legitimacy to the six fights which are otherwise marred by wirework that's a bit too obvious for my liking. The final battle - taking place on a seesawing pane of glass suspended high over the city - isn't a kung fu masterpiece but more suspenseful and nail-biting than I expected, and perhaps best demonstrates the movie's striving for style. You also get a couple chase scenes, one of which takes place on a crowded highway between a Lamborghini and a Formula 1 racer; making for a well-rounded but not mind-blowing action package.

Even with two of its main characters being Americans, it's surprising that the entire movie was filmed with English dialogue, and perhaps even more so that all of the Hong Kong actors do a respectable job of delivering their lines: Aaron and Leehom obviously spoke English to begin with, but even guys like gangster Lau Siu-Ming (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swordsman/dp/B00004YKSH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swordsman</a>) don't sound like they're having their lines fed to them. This is in strong favor of making the film seem more like an American blockbuster than a special interest fight flick, and while I applaud most of the efforts to make the movie more accessible to audiences around the world, Tong went a bit overboard when he incorporated a couple ""humorous"" dream sequences and used Coolio's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coolio-Com/dp/B00005HWDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coolio. Com</a>&nbsp;album as the foundation of the soundtrack (good for you if you enjoy it, but that damn ""I Like Girls"" track doesn't fit the movie at all).

Since my main complaint with Hong Kong fare is that the storytelling is never as coherent as I'd like it to be, ""China Strike Force"" gets points for being as refined and streamlined as it is, but I have to admit that some of the charm is lost in the process of westernization. It's arguable whether this one would've fared better as a straight American production with Hong Kong influences (a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>) rather than the other way around, but in the end, this solid movie just doesn't have enough zing to make it stand out more than a bit.",1290384000,,5489,6.443690637720488
7945695,5,B00005MKM0,"I love Mark Dacascos and Aaron Kwok. As a fan of Hong Kong action films, this is a great film. The film was shot in China and cinematography is beautiful. An imperial palace is part of the background setting and also the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. Two handsome and talented actors both with martial arts skills and a gorgeous Japanese leading lady whom can kick butt. What else could you ask for? Dacascos is the real star here and gets to play an evil villain. Coolio is a good pick to play a drug dealer and he gets in on the action too. The plot is pretty standard, but the actors and action keep you hooked until the end.",1211587200,,629,4.294117647058823

""Dats 1,500 dollars a bottle Toney"".  ""I'll send you a case"".  I mean stuff like this is great.  Some more fights scenes from AAron Kwok and i give it 5 stars.",1173139200,,334,4.15625
7945697,3,B00005MKM0,"Although the other actors make a decent effort, it's obvious that Mark Dacascos is the one who really knows what he's doing. While the others use wires to make themselves look good, Mark doesn't, and he still looks better.
Disecting the story would be pretty pointless. It's standard fare and offers nothing revolutionary, but as with all martial arts movies it's what you come to expect. Kind of a shame really, but anytime I can watch Mark is ok with me.
There is a rather touching performance dealing with the death of a character and the girls are lovely. Again, if you're looking for something deep this isn't the movie for you.",1077494400,,633,4.660714285714286
7945698,3,B00005MKM0,"This is an average Hong kong actioner with its cast from diverse countries.  From Hong Kong, upcoming star Arron Kwok appears as a special agent in Shanghai while America provides Coolio as a drug lord and Mark Dacascos as a gangster hungry for money and power (rare case for him to play a bad guy).  Plus from Taiwan you get singer Leehom Wang as Kwok's hot-shot sidekick, and Japan also sends its popular actress Norika Fujiwara as a mysterious spy.  It is obvious that ""China Strike Force"" (in Japan where I saw it, it was called ""Spy_N"") is made for international market, and whether it succeeds or not, I don't know, but as an action film it fares better than many other outings from Hong Kong, where you can see no longer Jackie,  Chow, or maestro Woo constantly.
And the story is about a Chinese police team of Arron Kwok and Leehom Wang, who must stall some plot of a joint force of Chinese crime syndicate (Dacascos) and American gangster (Coolio), about some drug deal, but it is just a usual excuse to carry on 90 minutes of exciting actions and dull dialogues.  Just wait till the film kicks off its action scenes, which are quite impressive.
There are two things that you might be interested.  Director Stanley Tong is famous for Jackie Chan films, especially ""First Strike"" and ""Rumbles in the Bronx"" (the latter reaching the No. 1 box-office hit in US), and ... (embarrasing silence) ...  Lesley Nelsen's ""Mr. Magoo.""  His first Holywood film was surely a bomb.  But he went back to his roots, real Hong-Kong actioner, and made a pretty good one, even though it sometimes goes to far, showing too much superflous viloence.
Another thing is that the location is not in Hong-Kong, but in Shanghai, and that may add some value to the film.  This means it was shot in China, not in a rather crowded city of Hong Kong, so the actions are done with a larger scale as a result, and  especailly the following two -- a ""Driven""-like car chase sequence, and the final action using helicopter carrying a car  and a glass panel held at the deadly height -- is very exciting.",1027641600,8,2077,4.568733153638814
