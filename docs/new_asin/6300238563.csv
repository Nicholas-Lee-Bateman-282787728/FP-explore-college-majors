I love low budget horror films especially ones in the 80's and this movie was a disappointment. I was hoping for some fun B Movie but when the movie began I was already a little worried. I didn't recognize any of the actors and the acting was bad in the film as well as horrendous dialogue but that didn't bother me too much since I love low budget films but the film is supposed to take place in the sea and it takes them an hour to even set sail. For the first hour nothing really happens we are offered this really confusing beginning as well as back stories for the three war veterans. The first hour of the movie was a 1/10 for me as it was confusing and just plain not fun but the last half hour was slightly better with a 3/10 from me. Another thing is, I read the plot on IMDB and it is nothing like the film, for some reason to me the plot description on IMDB seemed like a Supernatural Horror Film with it sounding like war veterans with a troubled past and their wives set sail and are haunted by ghosts of a massacre, I swear that's what it says on IMDB but Moon in Scorpio is just a extremely predictable slasher film which try's to be a mystery but is completely obvious who the killer is.

At the end of the day, I didn't hate the film but I didn't like it but I am actually one of the very few to actually say I seen Moon in Scorpio. Th film was never released on region 1 DVD and probably will never be because it is so unknown. Even for B Movie Fans, My Advice is to Skip The Film.",1363219200,,1622,3.9907692307692306

Yes, most of the acting in the movie is below average.  However, the movie is definitely worth watching because of John Phillip Law's performance.  JPL is very convincing as a kind, tender and sensitive man trying to put his past war experiences behind him.  It was good to see JPL projecting his depth and versitility.  A must see for John Phillip Law fans!",1167955200,,494,4.809523809523809
