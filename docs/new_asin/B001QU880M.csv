3770696,5,B001QU880M,"This is a good cross-section of 1960's TV cartoons (& a few theatricals shown on TV) that are owned by Warner Brothers.  Some of these are new to DVD, and this could be their only appearance on DVD.  TV animation collectors will wonder why the double dip of TOP CAT, THE FLINTSTONES & THE JETSONS, but hey with the low price I am willing to jump past them (or just watch them again).
Where else are we going to see Peter Potomas, Breezly & Sneezy, Yippie & Yappie & Yahooie?

3770707,4,B001QU880M,The verbage on the box stating the cartoon collection is for the adult collector and not suitable for children This is a poor statement.

3770751,1,B001QU880M,"If you absolutely must have this mediocre collection of B-list cartoons, don't pay this price for it.  You can get the exact same line-up of cartoons for about half the price if you buy 4 Kids Favorites: Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s.  At this writing, Saturday Morning Cartoons was $17.10 and 4 Kids Favorites was $8.95.  I know that Amazon prices can change suddenly and dramatically, but it's at least worth taking a look at the two titles before making the purchase.  The larger point, though, is why buy this collection at all?  There are so many good collections of cartoons out there in this price range: The first season of the Flintstones, 4 Kids Favorites, The Jetsons - a two volume set, the first season of Scooby Doo, Looney Tunes, Premiere Collection, and on and on it goes.  There are way better options with a few taps on the keyboard.",1432080000,,853,4.653333333333333

I won't go into listings of shows as others posted them in detail. Just want to say great shows and enjoyed them now as I did then. I'm still waiting for full series of Atom Ant, Secret Squirrel, and Quick Draw McGraw shows.

3770803,5,B001QU880M,"This collection of cartoons has Saturday morning living anytime you watch it. The episode selection makes it easy to bypass any you don't care for, but all in all the set is a watch all with a bowl of popcorn and a child that hasn't grown up seeing them.  There are some that have been restored and at times it is evident that they are not ""new"", but they are well worth the time and viewing.

They should watch these old cartoons which is much funnier and awesome than regular show, steven universe, and etc. Synder Stuart is a bad president today for cartoon network. This box contains Top  Cat, Atom ant, and some looneey toons. I don't like looney toons, just watch it on youtube. Id rather watch like Yappee because it is a lot rarer and funnier than tom and jerry and looney toons. The looney tunes is a waste of space in this dvd set.",1391731200,,586,4.425925925925926

Looking at it now that I am grown up, funny as ever.  Not for kids though.  Fred Flinstone as the Happy House Wife's Husband was so damn funny.",1391126400,,294,3.693548387096774
3770807,4,B001QU880M,"SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS/1960S VOL. 1: Back in the three channel, pre-VCR, pre-info-mercial world of kiddie programming, an uninterrupted six hour block of toons on Saturday morning almost made parents and teachers bearable for the rest of the week. The debut volume of SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS concentrates on the sixties hey day of limited animation kings HANNA BARBERA, who specialized in anthropomorphic critters and humorous humans like THE FLINTSTONES and THE JETSONS, families at opposite ends of the past/future spectrum. They also pumped out the BILKO-channeling conniver TOP CAT and colorful, fun packed series headlined by wild west zero QUICK DRAW MCGRAW, JAMES BOND spoof SECRET SQUIRREL and pet store problem child MAGILLA GORILLA their co stars SNOOPER & BLABBER, SQUIDLEY DIDDLEY and PUNKIN PUSS are less likely to ring a bell). Sleek sci fi do gooders SPACE GHOST, FRANKENSTEIN JR. (an Americanized GIGANTOR) and THE IMPOSSIBLES (who doubled as a rock group) represented HB's more serious side, tapping into the super hero craze of the era. WARNER BROTHERS, who now control the HANNA BARBERA catalogue, offer up their own looney luminaries from THE PORKY PIG SHOW, former theatrical cartoons that are easily the wildest in the bunch. So tune in, turn on and laugh it up...just don't spit out any of your CAP'N CRUNCH!

I used to watch a staple diet of cartoons as a child on Saturday morning in the 1980's. By the time I was in high school, I slept in on Saturday mornings. I remember when NBC stopped showing cartoons in 1993! These cartoons on these DVD's are very old fashioned. There's casual racism, sexism, cartoon violence, dishonesty, etc. Some people in the 21st Century support political correctness. This 2 disc set is a compilation of cartoons featuring Top Cat, The Flintstones, The Looney Tunes, Atom Ant, Secret Squirrel, and more. The cartoons in this set still have scratches, lines and dirt on the prints.
The Flintstones cartoon on this set uses an instrumental theme with footage of Fred Flintstone driving home from work. Most of us are familiar with the catchy Flintstones theme song.  There's a Quick Draw McGraw cartoon on this set. I laugh out loud as an orange dog named Snuffles gets ecstacy from eating dog biscuits!

3770859,4,B001QU880M,"If you were lucky enough to have grown up in the 1960s or 1970s, you grew up in the golden age of Saturday morning cartoons.  In those pre-cable TV days you had just the three major Television networks and each of them loaded their Saturday morning schedules with cartoons from 7:30am until noon.  It was the one day of the week when you didn't mind getting up early.  You'd pour yourself a bowl of your favorite cereal and plop yourself down in front of the TV.

You can relive those days again with two new DVD sets from Warner Bros:  Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1960's vol. 1 and Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1970's vol. 1.  Today I'll be taking a look at the 1960s set.  This set features over five hours of classic toons on two DVDs along with several DVD extras.

You'll be amazed at how the memories of these shows come flooding back as soon as you hear the theme music for each show.  Music and lyrics that you've not heard in decades are suddenly on the tip of your tongue and I have to praise the producers for including the original themes for all of these shows.

Atom Ant kicks things off with ""Up and Atom"" from 1965 as our tiny hero tracks down a couple of prison escapees.  Atom Ant, like Might Mouse and others, was animation's attempt to cash in on popular comic book heroes, notably Superman.

The Porky Pig Show featured toons from many of Warner Bros. animated characters.  Here on this set we get the Daffy Duck mystery ""Super Snooper"" with Daffy as a hard-boiled detective, and ""Mice Follies"" a parody of the Honeymooners TV show.  Other popular characters that appear in this set include favorites: Top Cat, Peter Potamus, Secret Squirrel, Quickdraw McGraw, The Flintstones, Magilla Gorilla, and the Jetsons.

As the decade of the 1960s progressed, Saturday Morning Cartoons moved away from funny animals and humor into more adventure cartoons and science fiction.  ""The Heat Thing"" is a 1965 Space Ghost Adventures as the team battles a lava pit monster on one of Jupiter's moons.  ""The Bubbler"" is from Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles.  The Impossibles were a superteam/rock band ala The Beatles, featuring: Coil-Man, Fluid-Man, and Multi-Man.

Frankenstein Jr., a Robotic version of the famous monster, battles an electrical monster in ""The Shocking Electric Monster"" from 1966.  Frankenstein Jr. was voiced by Ted Cassidy, best known for playing the butler ""Lurch"" in the Addams Family TV series.

Another of the great 1960s Sci-fi shows that is still being shown on the Boomerang Network is the Heculoids.  This show featured the five creatures Zok the dragon, Igoo the Rock Ape, Tundroo the Rhino-like creature, and Gloop & Gleep the protoplastic creatures who defend the planet Quasar and various alien threats along with their humanoid friends.

Mixed in with these characters are a number of lesser known stars including The Winsome Witch, Marine Boy, Dino Boy, and Squiddly Diddly.

The overall quality of the cartoons is very good to outstanding although the discs include a disclaimer stating that in some cases, the original masters were not available to make transfers from.

This was a special time in kid's lives that unfortunately is not here anymore.  With entire networks devoted to cartoons, Saturday Mornings are no longer what they were years ago but you can relive those days with these new sets from Warner Bros.  Hopefully the popularity will prove strong enough that we can eventually get these entire series on DVD instead of just these random samplings.",1269907200,4,3507,4.870151770657673
3770860,4,B001QU880M,"This really brings back the memories - some real classics here. How sad that we can only get some of these in a jumble of assorted cartoons instead of releasing complete collections the way it should be done. I have really been hoping to see a complete set of all of the Herculoids cartoons released. It is long overdue. Tragically, there are many others that should also be available but aren't: Thundarr the Barbarian; Mighty Max; Mighty Mouse; and the Banana Splits Show with all of its cartoons - The Adventures of Gulliver, The Arabian Knights, The Three Musketeers, and Danger Island. Is there no justice in this world?
And what about the cartoons that are released on dvd but not as a complete set? Like the ""Best of the Scooby Doo Movies""? If they were going to put out that many cartoons, why not include the other 8 or 10 that are missing? Finally, the greatest crime of all was to publish the Looney Toons Golden Collections and then stop when there are still some classics missing, for example: what happened to the rest of the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons? There are still many of those not available.",1263686400,2,1110,4.611111111111111

We sure have come a long way haven't we when cartoons such as Quick Draw McGraw,Top Cat and Magilla Gorilla are now considered ""unsuitable for children"".I don't know whether to shake my head or to be insulted;I do know it leaves a bad taste in my mouth,but let's on with the review shall we?
This hodge podge collection of 1960s Hanna-Barbera 'toons is a wonderful release of some shows that haven't been seen like this in almost 50 years....gee,has it been that long?Each show has its' original openings and endings restored as they originally appeared. Warners does give a warning that many of these extraneous elements were not found in pristine condition and had to be carefully pieced back together. They're easy to spot but considering everything I think they did a bang up job in restoring them. Here is what you will find/rediscover on each of these two discs:
Disc one-""Tycoon"" from the Top Cat Show(1966),The Atom Ant Show w/Precious Pup and Hillbilly Bears(1965),The Peter Potomaus Show w/ Breezly and Sneezly and Yippee,Yappee and Yahooey(1964),The Secret Squirel Show w/Squiddly Diddly and Winsome Witch(1965),The Flinstones ep""The Happy Household""(1960),The Porky Pig Show(1964)w/a Porky cartoon""Often an Orphan(1949),""Mice Follies""(the Gleason/Carney take off-1959)and ""Super Snooper""(Daffy Duck as a detective-1952),The Quick Draw McGraw Show w/Snooper and Blabber and Augie Dogie and Dogie Daddy(1960).Specials include two featurettes""Saturday Morning Wake Up Call""(a general discussion about the toons on this DVD) and ""The Good,the bad and the el-kabong""(a discussion about Quick Draw McGraw).
Disc two-""Rosie the Robot"" from the Jetsons(1962),Marine Boy,an early Japanese Anime' series released by Seven Arts in the States(1966),The Space Ghost Show w/Dino Boy(1966),The Herculoids Show(1967),The Frankenstein Jr.and the Impossibles Show(1966),The Magilla Gorilla Show w/Punkin Puss and Ricochet Rabbit(1964).Specials include:An extra Quick Draw McGraw Show(1961),three featurettes:another ""Saturday Morning Wake Up Call(talking about the shows on this disc),and the other two on ""The Herculoids"" and ""Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles"",and some trailers.
It is a jam packed two disc set and everyone will certainly have their faves(not all are created equal in quality),but mine has to be,by a country mile,Quick Draw McGraw. It was a real joy to be reunited with Quick Draw after almost 50 years being apart. And he hadn't lost his comical touch either.
There is something for just about everyone in this first volume of (mostly)Hanna-Barbera releases. It is certainly aimed at the ones who first watched the original airings those many years ago but please disregard the aforementioned ""disclaimer"",as these cartoons are just as relevant and funny today as they were then. Delight your youngsters or your grand-children and let them discover the fun times and delights that await them with the likes of Magilla Gorilla,Quick Draw McGraw,The Flinstones and the rest of the gang.",1256688000,7,3218,5.596311475409836
3770864,3,B001QU880M,"I was excited to see Quickdraw on the cover but there is no Quickdraw on the DVDs!?

3770865,3,B001QU880M,"I'm a big animation fan - especially of vintage TV animation - so seeing Warners releasing these packages looked to be a real treat, since it seemed unlikely that we'd get full sets of most of these characters.  I applaud the fact that they're making these available at all. My problem is with the amount of effort put into finding decent masters or cleaning up what they have.  We've seen what they can do with 50+ year old Looney Tune shorts. I'm at a loss why they can't take more time to clean up some of the scratches off some of the weaker films in these packages.  One of the 2 Quick Draw shorts is so dark it's almost painful to watch.  Do I think they could havve found better masters of done a better job cleaning things up, yes, but that would have taken time and money-and I don't think they want to put that kind of effort into a set like this.  The short of Ricochet Rabbit has audio that speeds up and slows down-it's downright painful to listen to.  The other major nitpick about these is that many of these shows had short transitional bumpers in between the cartoons(Secret Squirrel, Frankenstein Jr. & The Impossibles, Space Ghost, Etc.) that have been omitted. There are Volume 2 sets planned for the 60s & 70s that include both the Bugs Bunny Show, Road Runner Show & The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Hour.  These transitional bumpers were an integral part of these shows and NEED to be included. This is what made those programs unique.  I so hope Warners gets it right with the next volumes.
Now, this is not to say I'm not recommending this set-it's enjoyable. If you 'loved the shows-you still will, but if you're a completest - and want to see the shows as they originally aired, you won't find them here.",1248998400,29,1725,4.436708860759493
3770866,3,B001QU880M,"Like most kids, I loved cartoons when I was growing up. This is why I picked up this set. There are some very good cartoons here, but there are also some very forgettable ones too. I'll just randomly mention what I liked and didn't like. I realize some of the characters or cartoons that I liked were part of shows that I said I didn't like. I think this is a mixed bag of features. The package seems to lack a cohesive idea or structure. Some cartoons are very infantile, while others are more enjoyable to older kids. Surely the cartoons were meant to appeal to different age groups. I just found some of the cartoons to be too silly, childish and moronic. Some characters are simply very lovable, with actors that very memorable voices. Some art is simply much better than it is on other shows. I wonder too why The Flinstones and The Jetsons are on this collection. Everyone has seen these shows. We know them well. A better choice would have been to include something ELSE. How about more Frankenstein Jr, or more Augie Doggie, or more Quick Draw Mc Graw, more Snooper and Blabber, Hillbilly Bears, etc.

There is so much junk on Saturday mornings these days.  The 60's & 70's were so much better.  This is a great DVD to share with your children.",1247961600,3,481,4.3977272727272725
3770929,1,B001QU880M,"It amazes me to think I once considered these cartoons entertaining. Then again, when I was a kid I considered a bowl of cereal, a candy bar and a can of soda to be a good meal. You outgrow stuff like that, and stuff like this. If you buy it, like we did, then the nostalgia racket has your number.

What's wrong with the cartoons in this compilation? Well, the comedies aren't funny, the adventure shows are boring and inane, and the one ray of light on these discs -- the Warner Bros. theatrical cartoons repackaged for television on ""The Porky Pig Show"" -- includes a truly disturbing ""Honeymousers"" cartoon that plays domestic violence for laughs.

It's instructive, if painful, to watch both of these discs from beginning to end. The ""Top Cat"" and ""Flintstones"" episodes on disc one feature actual storytelling, characterization, and evocative settings -- Top Cat's Damon Runyon-esque New York, the Flintstones' satirical Bedrock (a clear precursor to the Simpsons' Springfield) -- that the shorter cartoons dispense with in favor of rapid fire slapstick (or rapid fire action in the case of the superheroes). In the earlier short subjects, you can still detect the occasional flash of imagination, as in the ""Snooper & Blabber"" cartoon that has a pair of furry gumshoes investigating a mystery on Mars, but not long afterwords we're stuck with increasingly generic characters in increasingly generic settings and stories. Atom Ant? Secret Squirrel? Ricochet Rabbit? Magilla Gorilla? What do you actually remember about any of these characters?

Though the ""Space Ghost"" and ""Herculoids"" cartoons are less than ten minutes long, watching them seems to take an eternity. Are these characters successful heroes only because all their adversaries are idiots? Does anything at all about ""The Impossibles"" -- pop stars who double as a quasi-military crimebusting unit -- make sense? As a kid, I didn't care; as an adult, this tripe just makes my head hurt.

No, I'm not about to pick up the second ""Saturday Morning"" volume, devoted to the cartoons of the 'seventies. I have my limits.",1247961600,7,2085,5.034782608695652

The special features are entertaining, but too short. The only real problem with this set is the double dipping they did. If you have purchased all of the Hanna-Barbera sets, then you already have four of the shows in this collection. I was hoping to see all these cartoons released in full series sets.

The wide reach of Cartoon Network's/ Warners merger allows them to include Marine Boy, imported from Japan, and three theatrical Looney Tunes/ Merrie Melodies that ran on TV from 1964-'67 on The Porky Pig Show. The 'toons aren't all the same length, as H-B experimented with the one episode half hour format, as with the Flintstones, the usual three 'toon format, as with The Huckleberry Hound Show, as well as hour and even hour and a half shows. The longer shows were often broken apart for syndication so single cartoons could be shown on live-host kid's shows.

This disc is jammed with special features. ""The Good, the Bad, and the El Kabong"" takes a look at The Quick Draw McGraw Show, H-Bs third cartoon show counting from ""Ruff and Reddy"" and ""The Huckleberry Hound Show"", which also featured the popular supporting cartoons, Snooper and Blabber, and Auggie Doggie. As this special reveals, the writing was all by Michael Maltese, who also wrote all of the best Chuck Jones Looney Tunes, like The Rabbit of Seville and What's Opera, Doc?, and who here finally gets his due. Watching the credits, one sees what a huge influence he was in these early, witty H-B cartoons. It's difficult to believe that Quick Draw McGraw dates from 1959, as the shows hold up so well and the dialogue still sparkles. Included here is an entire show (three cartoons), with a second show in the special features on disc two.

Other special features include a brief documentary on 'The Herculoids"", H-B's ground-breaking science-fiction adventure show designed by Alex Toth. It boggles the mind to think that this is the show that started all the uproar about violence in cartoons, when the SF action seems so much less violent than in Tom and Jerry. Nevertheless, it's enough to get this warning label, that this set ""is intended for the adult collector and is not suitable for children"". Never mind that this totally contradicts the upbeat blurb on the box, likely written by a happy go-lucky writer as overjoyed as us to see these 'toons on DVD: ""share them with someone who never imagined you were once a kid"". Fortunately, this set includes two Herculoids episodes so viewers can see what the furor was all about (and probably get hooked on this astounding show).

There's also a mini-blurb on The Adventures of Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles, which aired in 1966. This very interesting show had Jonny Quest music on the sort of serious Frankenstein Jr. segment, and Jetsons looking designs in the Impossibles, rock stars AKA superheroes, a now odd mix that seemed obvious at the time. Three segments are included from that show.

Each disc has a bonus ""Saturday Morning Wake-Up Call, but in both cases they seem to be taken from Cartoon Network's Boomerang channel, the only place you could see these cartoons until the release of this set. CN also ran a ""Boomerang"" show featuring cartoons from various years. The announcer on one blurb says the cartoon block runs three hours (this set runs five plus hours), and on the other calls it the ""Saturday Morning Adventure Hour"" and your ""Cartoon Wake-Up Call"" that makes every day Saturday. Most, but not all, of the segments shown are on these discs. The blurb for this set in the Trailers is much better done.

Hanna-Barbera's shows were so popular that they ran on all three networks in the '60s (yes, there were only three networks), often competing with themselves. The Peter Potamus Show here, from 1964, has the closing credits from the 1965-66 version, which shows Ricochet Rabbit, originally a segment on the Magilla Gorilla Show. The Peter Potamus Show was originally sponsored by Ideal Toys, with the sponsor's name in the theme song and credit sequence. Here it's cut out of the opening titles but left in on the closing theme. Three segments from the later show are included in this set.

The last bonus feature is called ""Trailers"", and features seven cartoon trailers. These are fun to watch, but I often wonder why all the trailers can't be put in a section like this. Disc one opens with an ad for ""The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"" and a mini-feature/ad for the DC Comics/ Warner ""Green Lantern"". Disc two opens with a whimsical ad for the Peanuts 1960s Collection. Both of these would be welcome in the Trailers section, but are annoying when they come on everytime you put the discs in so you have to press menu to skip ahead.

More trivia regarding this set: The Jetsons episode, ""Rosey the Robot"", from 1962, was the series' debut. Marine Boy was the second color series to be imported from Japan. The Porky Pig Show cartoons date from: ""Often an Orphan"" -1949; ""Super Snooper"" (Daffy Duck)- 1952; Mice Follies (Honey-Mousers)- 1960. Anyone who loves cartoons or, like this reviewer, is a die-hard Hanna-Barbera fan, will be overjoyed with this set. As Joe Barbera once said, ""I'm in favor of cartoons that are mindlessly funny, not mindlessly preachy."" You got it Joe. Mindlessly funny. That sums up this set. H-B and Boomerang, bring 'em on!

3770934,4,B001QU880M,"OK, I've had enough with Warner deciding whether cartoons from the past are good for us or not.  First they edited the Tom and Jerry releases and kept several shorts from being released at all, then they started labeling cartoon collections with this: ""This collection is intended for the Adult Collector and MAY not be suitable for children.""  This collection and the others in the series says this:  Saturday Morning Cartoons - the 1960s is intended for the Adult Collector and is NOT suitable for children.""  What?  Seeing a pig without pants is bad for kids?  Atom Ant may make them think they have super powers and they could die jumping off a building?  Give me a break, Warners.  I'd much rather my children watch this than the stuff that's on TV today.",1243987200,193,760,4.661654135338346
3770935,5,B001QU880M,"Got my sixties set today, and watched most of the non-double-dip material - excluding Marine Boy, which I still feel seems out of place in this package.

The package has its faults with print quality (but a disclaimer is offered to mitigate that), some double-dipping, and no complete content listing outside of the individual disc menus - but, overall, IT IS WORTH IT!

The Porky Pig Show has opening and closing credits AND INTERSTITALS!  The Magilla Gorilla Show has opening and closing credits - making it not a ""true"" double dip, as the Magilla ""Complete Series"" did not have these credits included anywhere in the set.

It features other shows I never thought I'd see on DVD like Peter Potamus, Atom, Ant, Secret Squirrel, and Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles!

Brief (average about 5 minutes each) but informative and entertaining features on Quick Draw McGraw, Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles, and The Herculoids with various animation figures including Paul Dini, Mark Evanier, and Earl Kress.

A true Who's Who of voicing, headlined by Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Don Messick, Paul Frees, and all the top talents of the day!

And, it sure made me long for complete sets of Quick Draw McGraw and The Herculoids!

Disc #1  - Top Cat - The Tycoon, Atom Ant Show with Precious Pup & The Hillybilly Bears (one of my favorites), The Peter Potamus Show with Breezly & Sneezly and Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey, Secret Squirrel Show with Winsom Witch and Squiddly Diddly, The Flintstones, The Porky Pig Show, The Quick Draw McGraw Show with Super Snooper & Blabber Mouth and Augie Dogie & Augie Daddy
Disc #2 - The Jetsons, Marine Boy, Space Ghost & Dino Boy Show (easily one of my all time favorites), The Herculoids, Marine Boy, Herculoids (Another one of the all time greats), Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles (A pure joy from my childhood), The Magilla Gorilla Show starring Punkin Puss and Ricochet Rabbit.

The big plus in having all of these cartoon greats in one collection are the bonus features where you can get the behind the scenes info on Quick Draw McGraw, Magilla Gorilla, and Frankenstein Jr & The Impossibles.

If you are into Saturday morning TV  and especially cartoons from Hanna-Barbera, this set is definitely recommended.",1481500800,7,1303,4.603448275862069
