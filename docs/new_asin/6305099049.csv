7882631,5,6305099049,"This was a very interesting story. The acting from E.G. Marhsall, Martha Plimpton and Beau Bridges as well as guest star John Laroquette was superb. The lawyers struggled with this case as the defendant admitted that he had murdered the victim. The victim was a rapist with a past of himself being abused. I cannot say that I agreed with the way that the case ended as I feel that the defendant did not get the punishment that he deserved despite the provocation that made him commit the crime. This movie is another excellent example of an issue movie that will keep the watchers of the movie thinking.",1350518400,,603,4.592592592592593
7882632,5,6305099049,"This excellent movie stars EG Marshall, Beau Bridges, and Martha Plimpton as Lawrence, Don, and MJ Preston, 3 generations of defense attorneys whose  latest client is Michael Lane (John Larroquette) a father who is charged  with the shooting death of a gentleman who raped his 8 year old daughter 7  years before, and it is a storyline and plot which will provoke deep  thought even in the most law abiding viewer - the thought being ""What  would you do if that had happened to me?  Would I do the same thing?""  and it demonstrates how violent crime can shatter families.  Lane is  portrayed by Larroquette as a bitter, vengeful man but a still loving  father, a man who is the shell of the person he once was.  The daughter who  was raped tried suicide several times and was in and out of psychiatric  hospitals.  His older daughter wound up living in a squat on skid row.  Yes, these characters aren't real, yes this is only a movie, but these  things do happen.  And some people dare to say that the justice system is  perfect, and that it does work?  It works to protect the criminals, not the  victims. Who knows?  Maybe vigilante justice is the best kind of  justice.
I would have no trouble recommending this movie to anyone else.  It deals with a compelling subject in a way that isn't trite or banal, but  is thoughtful.  The performances by each actor are spot on, and it contains  the exact amount of humanity and tension needed to sustain viewer interest  from beginning to end.  A true must see for those who like their movies to  reflect current issues which affect today's society.",967248000,2,1596,4.560283687943262
7882633,1,6305099049,"Great cast, including E.G. Marshall in a reprise of his role in the 60's TV series, John Laroquette, Beau Bridges, Mark Blum, good premise, familiar territory--more than enough for a good-ole courtroom whodunit.
But this  presentation begins to unnerve almost immediately. Martha Plimpton's  upstart young attorney is so annoying, it throws the whole meter of the  drama off the rails, time after time.
Her dialogue is so trite, so  predictable, that it gives the viewer absolutely no room to let her  character provide the conflict that's necessary to give the story some  depth. Her delivery is so harsh you almost reach for the volume-down button  every time she speaks.
Lack of subtlety, in the story, and the dialogue  are really the major culprits, Even the scenes without Plimpton are clich&eacute;,  and heavy-handed. Plimpton's performance is merely the cherry on  top.
It's a real shame",949622400,,896,5.159722222222222
