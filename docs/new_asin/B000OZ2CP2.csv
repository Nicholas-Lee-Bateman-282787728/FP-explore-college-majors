2806461,2,B000OZ2CP2,"It is amazing that a first-rate cast (Aaron Eckhart, Ian McKellen, William Hurt, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Britney Murphy, Alan Cumming, and an interesting premise on paper can turn out to be such a sleep-inducing film, but ""Neverwas"" is just that. The film was made in 2005 and never got a commercial release and was eventually shown on a cable network. Eckhart plays a psychiatrist who accepts a position at a mental institution where his father committed suicide. There, he reconnects with friends from his childhood as well as a patient (McKellen) who knew his father well and helps Eckhart undercover buried secrets, among them the secret fantasy world that his father created in a popular book. The film has a colorful visual style but it is not enough to bring any interest to this terribly boring film. Eckhart and McKellen are fine in their roles but actors like Jessica Lange, William Hurt and Alan Cumming are wasted.",1183420800,11,929,4.886075949367089

2806503,5,B000OZ2CP2,"I've had this movie for some years now, and just re-watched it today.  I have no idea why it went directly to DVD, if that is what happened, because I see several award winning performances in it.  Aaron Eckhart and Ian McKellen both do beautiful performances, as does Nick Nolte.  All 3 should have been recognized for their work in this film.  It's a strange and beautiful story, leaving us, the viewers, always wondering what's real and what's fantasy in the minds of the players, be they patient or doctor.  As I do when I read, I want to get lost in the story as it unfolds on the screen.  This movie certainly fills that want.  Plus, don't many of us want to understand our childhood and what things actually transpired, how those things affected us, and were those things real or our imagination?  For me, this story showed how things aren't always what they seem, or how we interpret them at the time of happening.

2806505,5,B000OZ2CP2,"To watch Ian McKellan in anything is a joy unto itself, but to find him at the heart of such an emotionally beautiful and rich film like Neverwas has to be one of the greatest of all Hollywood gifts to ever come along.

Neverwas is a superb, moving and special journey filled with the light of hope that so many of us lose sight of in our quest for our own ultimate realities that consume our daily lives. Nick Nolte gives a command performance here as well, and it has been a long time since I can say that he was involved with anything of such high caliber material.

Others have spoken of the impactful moments of the mental illness that seems to pervade Ian's character Gabriel, and the film's director and writers have so eloquently woven a tale of the possibility that the land of Neverwas could possibly exist, you are never sure whether or not the intent was to bring us there or not. When the answers come, you will cry with a soul tearing depth as you discover the wonderful reality of it all, and what the real journey is all about. This is a film of award level performance and writing; the kind of gem you hope to discover, but rarely do. And the incredible part is that I never expected this film to be what it was, and that's just great, because it is far more than I ever could have hoped for.

Why more films with this level of depth cannot be made today is a mystery. 5+++ stars",1434326400,,1396,4.260377358490566

2806516,5,B000OZ2CP2,"Quick Overview: Zachary takes on a job working at Millwood. An institution his father was held at. During his childhood Zach's father authored a popular children's book, then fell into a dark place before ultimately passing away. In a short time Zachary faces the battle of understanding his father and the tale of Neverwas.

What a great story. Throughout the movie I was stuck trying to decide if it was real or a delusion. The main draw for me though was how Zach deals with his father's legacy and how he comes to terms with it. He goes on a bit of a hunt to find out if this is real or just another psychotic fantasy with a good cast of characters.

This is a good film for all ages. It is mellow enough that young minds can enjoy it and interesting enough to capture the adults as well. Perfect for family night.",1399852800,,818,4.339869281045751

2806520,5,B000OZ2CP2,"I put off watching this movie for a long time, thinking (quite wrongly) that it would be a light-hearted children's-themed tale. It is not. The theme of mental-illness at the center of this movie is treated in a sensitive and extremely touching manner. I'm not generally a mawkish person--honestly--but when watching this film I found myself welling up on more than one occasion (though one in particular stands out--where the clash of sick mind and overflowing heart is given wrenching paternal expression). The pacing is perfect, the casting is spot-on, and the acting is superb. The movie also manages to maintain a consistent ""atmosphere"" of freshness, wonder, and expectation. The ending surrounding Gabriel is somewhat unrealistic--though perfectly excusable for the purpose of effectively wrapping up the ""tale"" and driving home the underlying point regarding the idiosyncratic and sometimes cathartic nature of mental ""illness"" ... The name of the movie perfectly captures both the ephemeral yet at the same time palpable nature of the characters' (and our) perception of and response to the vicissitudes of reality ...",1388534400,,1127,5.409090909090909

I who takes care of someone who is plagued with mental disease was touched by someone writing a story on something that I live everyday of my life.  Gabriel's compelling hopes, visions, desires and life is a much familiar family character to me and the rest of the family is a group of people in my reality story line that I struggle with to ensure freedom for the one who I take care of.  I who like Zachary begins to inherit the love and compassion to take care of someone who is special.  The difference is I was never plagued with this in my family.  The story line is a reminder that freedom is something everyone desires whether carrying the gene of mental illness or not.

2806530,4,B000OZ2CP2,"I have no recollection of this film and, with this cast, I'm curious as to why. The studio should have been all over this. Well....it hit my radar. I watched it, and it was well worth my while.

Here's the scoop. Aaron Eckhart plays Zach Riley. His dad (Nick Nolte) was author of a hugely popular children's fantasy book. But dad was a tortured soul and ended up hanging himself. Zach is now an accomplished psychiatrist who wants to work at the bust-out, run down institution at which his dad was housed. He meets up with a patient who makes him suspect the ""Neverwas"" of his father's book might not be all fiction.

I like these kinds of movies. Like ""12 Monkeys"" the lead character might be really crazy. But if his crazy story pans out......we're in for a wild ride. In this version as in ""12 Monkeys"", the head shrink gathers the clues and begins to experience self doubt. There are a fair number of these kinds of films out there and this is one of the better ones. The core cast members all do a stand up job. But why did they bother with Vera Farmiga, Alan Cumming and Michael Moriarty? Their roles are miniscule. They could could have hired anyone to play those parts. Phillip Glass handles the music. It's not really unlike his other works but it helped move things along. All the production values were of a high level. One thing that really stuck out to me were the set designs and locations. This was set in upper state New York in the fall and it's shot lovingly. You would be hard pressed to find more beautiful scenery. And the ""Neverwas"" castle set was exquisite. It was a hodge-podge of all sorts of 'found' things cobbled together. But it was wayyyyyyy cool.

The story has a decent ending. In ""12 Monkeys"", it turns out Bruce Willis wasn't crazy. In this film they play it both ways, but it makes sense. This is a cool, feel-good movie. Maybe not haute cuisine, but a great plate of comfort food.",1364428800,,1916,4.4375

2806537,4,B000OZ2CP2,"Zach Riley (Aaron Eckhart) is a young psychiatrist who pushes his way into the mental hospital near his home. He's overqualified, and the director knows it, but he simply won't take no for an answer. Why?

Another one of those stories where there's so little I can tell you without being a spoiler. So some fragmented facts.

Zach's father was Thomas Leonard Pierson (Nick Nolte), who got famous for writing a children's fantasy adventure called ""Neverwas."" The main character was named Zack, a boy a little older than Pierson's son was when he wrote the book. But T. L. Pierson, for all his success, was a tortured man, and when Zach was eight years old, he hung himself. Indeed, it was Zach who discovered his body.

So why is Zach calling himself Riley now, not Pierson? Riley is his mother's maiden name. It's clear he wishes to distance himself from his famous father's legacy, but why?

Maggie Blake (Brittany Murphy) is a girl who has known Zach since childhood, and is delighted to come across him in a pub the evening after Zach arrived back in town. She is also a major Neverwas fan, which creates a strangely conflicted attitude in Zach. Why?

Gabriel Finch (Ian McKellen) is a long-time patient in the hospital in which Zach is now working, and becomes Zach's first individual patient. Turns out he is living out a fantasy life which is King of Neverwas. Is this a weird coincidence?

""Sometimes a story finds a storyteller, not the other way around."" T. L. Pierson",1336694400,,1477,4.683397683397684
2806538,3,B000OZ2CP2,"I'm not really sure what to think about Neverwas.  I mean I wasn't given ANY indication that it's not actually a believable type of drama involving a psychiatrist and his patient.  It's more of a fantasy/fairy tale-type film, thanks to the king of fantasy himself, Mr. Ian McKellen.

The storyline, as a result, is confusing and just plain *odd* to say the least.  MeKellen's character believes he's the king of Neverwas, and through psychiatrist evaluations and appointments, the man who plays the actual psychiatrist (Aaron Eckhart) has to figure out whether Ian McKellen's character is actually telling the truth or not.  Eventually Aaron Eckhart gets more than he bargains for when his father plays a part in all this.

Well... this is most certainly NOT what I expected given the description.  Not really what I wanted from the storyline, either.  As a result, I was battling too very different feelings while watching Neverwas this afternoon- confusion and disappointment.

I guess, to provide a compliment, there's nothing really LIKE it.  Not a storyline resembling anything I've ever experienced before, that's a fact!  However, it's mostly a childrens movie.

Alright maybe it's a tad too time-consuming, long-winded and confusing for the average child (since, as I mention above, even *I* was totally baffled on numerous occasions) but the fantasy element of helping someone who may not be what he seems (McKellen's character) is probably the movies main drawing point.  If you like that sort of thing, Neverwas is most certainly for you.

However, the one bright spot is (as always) Brittany Murphay's character.  I'm still angry that she's no longer with us.  I had a crush on her when I was younger so my emotions tend to get the better of me whenever I see her starring in a movie.  It still bothers me that she's no longer here.  Her beautiful eyes and amazing smile were always elements I'd look forward to.  There's a scene involving Aaron Eckhart's character, and Brittany's sitting at the living room table in a dress and smiling....  SO beautiful.  I miss her so much.  Her role in Neverwas is pretty good, though I can think of several other movies that better (and more appropriately) utilize her extraordinary talents.

Overall, Neverwas is for those who want a slightly different spin on the psychiatrist meets patient storyline, and leans towards a kids movie.  Remember this.",1320796800,,2402,5.007575757575758

2806545,4,B000OZ2CP2,"This is one of those movies that barely appeared and promptly vanished in spite of a cast of excellent actors and a so-so premise beautifully worked out. Note that I said actors, not stars. A handful of less than stellar initial reviews probably also torpedoed the production upon release, which is a pity: god knows that far, far worse productions endure a much more scathing reception, and yet endure, spread all  over the movie-publicity complex and your neighborhood Cineplex for months.

Aaron Eckhard plays Zack, a successful psychiatrist who is haunted by the suicide death of his troubled father when he was a small boy.  His father, (Nick Nolte, seen in flashbacks or vintage film and home movie footage) was the writer of a fabulously successful childrens' classic about a wonderful magical land called ""Neverwas"" which he wrote for his son, making him the hero-adventurer. As an adult, Zack takes a job at the mental hospital where his father was confined for a brief period, hoping to find out why his father killed himself. Was it a failure of his doctor, of the hospital itself? It is hinted that Zack became a psychiatrist as a way of trying to fix that which was broken, in his father, and in himself, and others.

The clinic is a gorgeous but dilapidated, neo-classical building, near a perfect small New England town; the whole country around the clinic and town is a wildly scenic rural area spangled with fall colors. The whole look of the place is stunningly beautiful, barely and believably a half-step from the enchanted world that Zack's father created a quarter century before. He meets up with a childhood pal,  Ally (Brittany Murphy) who seems to have never quite outgrown  her own longing to visit ""Neverwas"", or her own attraction towards Zack. Among his patients in the hospital is the schizophrenic Gabriel Finch, played by the magnificent Ian McKellon. Gradually, Zack realized, as Gabriel opens up to him, that Gabriel and his father were friends... and that Gabriel thinks himself as the imprisoned King of ""Neverwas"".

""Neverwas"" is in fact as much Gabriel's creation as it was his fathers... and it is as real to him as the forests beyond the boundaries of the hospital. The rest of the story is concerned with how Zack  comes to terms  with death,  guilt,  responsibility and the knowledge that sometimes there is nothing you can do, to help the ones you love... and sometimes you can.  Ally lets go of her own childish dependence on the enchanted world... although they both do briefly set foot in it. The sequence towards the end of the movie, where she and Zack follow Gabriel into the woods, is beautifully done. With a growing sense of wonder, they identify many of the magical landmarks and seem almost on the verge actually stepping into the mythical ""Neverwas""... but as it is subtly conveyed, they are still in the very real world. Only Gabriel, the schizophrenic can live in the world that he has created and maintained in his own mind for most of his life.

This is not a movie for children, although it may appear at first glance to resemble such fare as ""The Bridge to Terabithia"". It is more suited for teenagers and adults. While not one of those great unsung movies, it is still better worth the time than many other movie offerings taking up DVD shelf space, just for McKellen's star turn alone.",1242259200,2,3349,4.773356401384083

And now, I have to say I'm appalled that I hadn't heard of Neverwas before then.  It's a beautiful movie, with an incredible cast and a fabulous story, and not to mention visually stunning as well.

To briefly outline the beginning, a psychologist(Aaron Eckhart) returns to the town he grew up in, and starts working at an asylum of sorts where his father had spent time.  His father was an exceptionally famous children's fantasy author, and soon it becomes unclear whether the story he wrote was merely a story or if somehow there's more to it.  I'd say more, but part of the magic of this film is being surprised.

Neverwas is a happy movie without being insipid, and whimsical without being unbelievable or over done.  It's perfect, in my opinion.  You couldn't ask for a film with more imagination, and I think anyone would be delighted by it.  I could not have enjoyed it more if I tried!",1229212800,2,1004,4.472527472527473

If it had only been about the fairy tale, it wouldn't have been as meaningful. My advice is to let the movie be what it is. It is a mix of romance, father-son bonding, mental illness, mystery, and fantasy. The always superb Aaron Eckhart carries the movie very well, and he is supported with excellent performances by William Hurt, Brittany Murphy, and Ian McKellan.

Poor Brittany, reduced to this ""girlfriend"" part that suddenly morphs into the ""crack journalist"" part in which the journalist finds herself compromised by her relationship to the ""victim.""  (See ABSENCE OF MALICE.)

The movie revels in big reveal scenes and Aaron Eckhart gets to sneak into Brittany Murphy's room and find out her secret, the way that hardened FBI investigators break down an attic door and exclaim ""Oh my God"" to each other merely because the tenant has plastered his walls from top to ceiling with newspaper clippings.  If they could see my apartment, maybe they'd understand!  Sometimes you just need another coat of something up on your walls to keep in the heat, and old clippings of heinous crimes are just as good as new paint.

In Aaron's case, he's cute as a button both as a boy and man.  The cinematography literally gilds his blonde hair into a helmet of light that's scary to look at, like a Ken doll on fire.  William Hurt as the head of the hospital looks at him in disgust, wondering what happened to his own good looks that were so well used in BODY HEAT and that one with Sigourney Weaver where he, Hurt, was an idiot savant janitor and she a crack journalist in the Brittany Murphy mode.  The acting in the movie is wretched from top to bottom, but it would be entertaining anyhow, had the script been reined in a little.  The coincidences of the plot are manifold, like the lilies of the field, and they don't stop even when the credits are unrolling.  Jessica Lange plays her part as though she were trying out for Katharine Hepburn's old DELICATE BALANCE role, faded gentility parsed with attractive, withered madness.

While the movie has some similarities to others, they are small enough not to distract... The story leaves us with some positive ideas about uncomfortable subjects and just maybe stretches our own boundaries of acceptance.

He was as charming as always, but the story is the star of this movie. With the exception of the handling of the romantic subplot, the director managed to create a fairy tale for adults that held a bit of suspense and a lot of good feelings at the end.

 I fault the writers for a clumsy and unnecessary twist between the protagonist and his childhood friend turned love interest. The rest of the story was so satisfying, I can't believe they  fell back on such a clich&eacute;.

 Ian McKellen was as good as he's ever been as the King of Neverwas, and that wasn't an easy part to play. That character could easily have been too creepy or scary to engage the audience, but he managed to walk the line just so you wanted him not to get hurt, no matter how out of touch with reality he was.

2806556,3,B000OZ2CP2,"The story of director Joshua Michael Stern's 2005 film ""Neverwas"" centers around Zachary Riley/Pierson (Aaron Eckhart), a psychiatrist, who returns home to inadvertently delve into his own troubled past as the son of a legendary children's author of J. R. R. Tolkien stature.  Father T.L., creator of the beloved land of Neverwas--a fictitious conglomeration of elements from Tolkien's ""Hobbit,"" Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Phillip Pullman's ""The Golden Compass"" and C. S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" commits suicide after a stay in the very hospital in which Zach will practice.  Upon meeting inmate Gabriel (the sublime Ian McKellan--knight templar of the mellifluous voice) Zach discovers that the imaginary world that made his father famous, may very well have been the creation of someone else.  An interesting premise, I would think--implemented by all the right accoutrements: exquisitely rendered notebooks filled with lovely fantastical drawings that show in stages the supposed conception of the Neverwas universe (think of the intricate schematics the magician Eisenheim uses in film ""The Illusionist"") and an autumn-hued New England town awash with oodles of nostalgic T.L. ephemera ( a 25th anniversary edition of the book showcased in a bookstore window, father Pierson's introspective author's photo displayed at a local eatery and Brittany Murphy's coveted Neverwas lunchbox converted to a makeshift purse.)  Add plenty of psychologically intense moments of revelation supercharged with enough childhood flashbacks that even Sigmund himself would careen into a tailspin.  Packed with all the potential of a good m&eacute;lange of mystery, fantasy and psychology, the film should have been a contiguous epiphany of wondrous wows.

Not so, instead, ""Neverwas"" builds but never quite manages to sustain the fantastical element it needs to become magical. The concept, albeit a good one, gets bogged down with way too much schmaltz.  The over-edited script underutilizes a fine assemblage of actors with chopped hackneyed bits of dialogue that seem put together with the haphazard precision of a hacksaw.

Except for the commanding lyricism of Ian McKellan's voice, most of the actors play over-emphasized caricatures of their most remembered on-screen personae--Nick Nolte wallows yet again as another wasted derelict-here he portrays T.L. Pierson in black and white flashbacks that blare like a 60s strobe light.  Jessica Lange, as the writer's wife, shakily plummets towards an emotional basement fueled by booze a la her performance in ""Frances.""  William Hurt, as Dr. Reed, provides a firm yet understated avant-garde stability and calmness as the quiet-last-word authority figure as he does in every film he is in.  Brittany Murphy, as Zach's unnecessary love interest, remains the wide-eyed, slightly breathless ing&eacute;nue with her own agenda as depicted in ""8 Mile.""  Last but not least, Aaron Eckhart, as the protagonist, exemplifies the well-meaning psychiatrist whose telling facial expressions conjure up the hip, eureka-seeking academic as in ""Possession.""

Looked at as a whole, the sum of the parts does not a symbiotic coalition make.  Instead the result runs together at breakneck speed. Pressed on to a harrowing pace by the music of Philip Glass the momentum flutters like a manic faerie brightly highlighting the confused epiphanies of the viewer.  The outcome?  A rather disjointed muddied Fisher King without the feel-good modern day fairytale conclusion.

Unfortunately, ""Neverwas"" could have been more than just a minor film that went straight to DVD format.  With more scenes, more dialogue, less editing and more focus on the intended audience--the purpose of plot struggles here--is this a whimsical adult fairytale that professes a believe-in-Santa-Claus-in-the-face-of-even-the-starkest-reality like the children we all want to be or is this a psychological drama exploring Zach's (Eckhart) inner angst regarding his father's work, suicide and his own place in his father's life? The senior Pierson's torment although evident warrants further historical exploration.  The mere finding of wonderfully illustrated journals and unexplained photographs tantalize but cry out for a more detailed Da Vinci Code treatment.

Again, the only aspect of the film that works on any level includes the visible and audible presence of Ian McKellan.  McKellan plays Gabriel, the wannabe believer in all things Neverwas to unchallenged perfection.  Grand, yet woebegone, he remains the wizard in which we all wish to have faith.  Sadly, this character's true story never really rings true--the clunky script strangles any attempt at relevant illumination.

Bottom line?  ""Neverwas"" probably would make a much better novel than film.  Recommended as a potential fixer-upper for a film class.

2806557,3,B000OZ2CP2,"""All that I know that's worth a damn is in these pages.""  T. L. Pearson

Just about all Dr. Zach Riley (Aaron Eckhart) knows about his author father T. L. Pearson, (Nick Nolte), is that the protagonist in the children's fantasy novel he wrote, ""Neverwas,"" bore his name. His father killed himself almost 25 years before after spending time in Mill Wood, a mental institution.

When Zach hears about a job at Mill Wood, he quits his prestigious research job at Cornell and applies and won't take no for an answer despite warnings from Dr. Peter Reed's (William Hurt) that the AMA doesn't even consider the institute worthy of research funding, most of the patients are non-functional and under-insured.

Zach accepts a month's probationary period with no benefits telling Dr. Reed a small lie-- that he had a 'friend' at Mill Wood and the treatment he received hadn't worked. Dr. Reed had no way of knowing Zach's true identity since he'd abandoned his father's name for his mother's maiden name long ago.

""I know it's you,"" Gabriel Finch (Ian McKellen) tells Zach when they first meet.  He'd never said a word to a therapist for his 40 year psychiatric history until he saw Zach. Gabriel seems to believe that a spell was cast on Zach and he doesn't remember who he is or what he is supposed to do--and that, in a very little amount of time.

""Neverwas"" went straight from the can to DVD despite an amazing cast. Eckhart and McKellen are both brilliant--and there's far too little screen time for William Hurt. The acting is the best part of the story.

In my opinion, the problem is ""Neverwas"" really doesn't quite have a niche. It's not precisely a fantasy as it's billed or a psychodrama.

The music is a bit annoying. This quick two-note piano with strings seemed overwrought after awhile and was just wearing.

So---why see the film? ""Stories come to the storyteller and not the other way around,"" said Thomas Pearson in one part of the film. Writers will be interested in the mystery of how the novel ""Neverwas"" came to be.

Fans of psychological films like ""The 9th Configuration"" may also love this story.  It's a profile of not just mental illness, but what motivations drive a person into the mental health field.

My suggestion is that you rent this film before you buy it.  You may not want or need to see ""Neverwas"" again, but for the price of a rental, it's an interesting and inspiring way to spend a quiet afternoon.",1199404800,7,2433,4.654205607476635
2806558,5,B000OZ2CP2,"NEVERWAS, a little miracle of a movie written and directed by Joshua Michael Stern, is an allegory, a fairytale, a dissection of the impact of mental illness on parents and children, and story of compassion, believing, and blossoming of character that was created with a sterling ensemble of actors in 2005, failed to find a niche in theatrical distribution, and went straight to DVD - becoming one of those limited release films that is very elusive even in the megavideo stores.  The reasons for this relative anonymity are not clear, but film lovers will do well searching out this little gem: the rewards are immediate gratification and long lasting satisfaction.

Narrated by Ian McKellan who plays a major role in the film, the story concerns the return of psychiatrist Zachary Riley/Small (Aaron Eckhart) to an obsolete mental institution named Millhouse, the hospital where his author father T.L. Pierson (Nick Nolte) ended his days in suicide, having suffered from bipolar syndrome. Zach wants to discover secrets about his father, why his father's book 'Neverwas' has been so disturbing to Zach, and to offer good medical treatment to those patients living in the obscure hospital run by the kindly but enigmatic Dr. Reed (William Hurt).  Zach is buoyant, greets his new job with joy, and works with various patients in group and individual therapy (the group includes well developed characters portrayed by Alan Cumming, Vera Farmiga, and Michael Moriarty, among others) and encounters the apparently mute Gabriel Finch (Ian McKellan), a delusional man who believes Zach has returned to break the curse preventing his return to his imaginary kingdom of Neverwas.

Zach meets a 'grad student botantist'/reporter Ally (Brittany Murphy) who loves Zach's father's book and urges Zach to read the fairytale as a means to assuage Zach's new nightly nightmares and insomnia dealing with images of himself as a child, his father's suicide, and other strange forces. Ally's commitment to Zach's father's book, Zach's breakthrough to Gabriel Finch, together with Zach's re-evaluation of his agoraphobic mother (Jessica Lange) all intertwine to reestablish Zach's discovery of his relationship to a father whose mental illness prevented the close relationship Zach so desperately missed.  In a tumbling set of events that incorporate the fairytale of the book Neverwas with the reality of Zach's father's relationship to Gabriel Finch brings the story to a heartwarming, well considered, touching conclusion.  Being 'unordinary' is a goal, not a curse.

In addition to the above-mentioned stellar cast, small parts are also created by Bill Bellamy, Ken Roberts, Cynthia Stevenson among others. The cinematography by Michael Grady manages to keep the audience balanced between real and fantasy and the musical score by renowned composer Philip Glass fits the story like a glove. Ian McKellan gives a multifaceted performance of a man whose delusional life is far more real than his life as a mental patient, Aaron Eckhart finesses the transformation of the lost child seeking his roots with great skill, Nick Nolte gives one of his finer interpretations as the disturbed father/author, and  Brittany Murphy manages to maintain a much needed lightness to the atmosphere of the mental institution story setting.  The impact of the film, while absorbing from the first images, is the ending, a reinforcement of the importance of love and nurturing that too often is relegated to little books for children instead of the manner in which we live our lives. This is a fine film well worth ferreting out from the obscurity to which it so unjustly has been assigned. Grady Harp, October 07",1191196800,65,3680,5.234295415959253

2806565,3,B000OZ2CP2,"""Neverwas"" has one of the most impressive casts I have ever seen for a film that I never ever heard of before it came out on DVD.  This is a movie that takes Michael Moriarty and uses him as background.  There must be an interesting story about how writer and first-time director Joshua Michael Stern got such a strong cast for his film.  I assume that he got one big name, such as Ian McKellan, to sign and that is how Oscar winners like William Hurt and Jessica Lange signed out for small roles.  Perhaps they and Nick Nolte, Alan Cummings, and Cynthia Stevenson all came in and worked for a day or two on this film.  Now, I can describe what happens in ""Neverwas"" in a couple of sentences and if you were an actor you would probably want to be in the movie and it would sound like a film worth seeing, but that would give away what happens and I do not want to do that.  However, I can tell you that what might have looked good on paper does not translate to the screen, which would explain why ""Neverwas"" never went into commercial release.

There have been films about kids who were the lead characters in successful children's books, both fictional as in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterflies-Are-Free/dp/B0000633R8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterflies Are Free</a>"" and factual as in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamchild/dp/6302717655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamchild</a>.""  Both of those movies serve as reference points for ""Neverwas.""  The former was about a young blind man whose mother wrote a book for him about the adventures of ""Donnie Dark"" when he was a kid, and now he has to live that done.  The latter is about Alice Liddell Hargreaves, the little girl who inspired the Reverend Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) to write ""Alice in Wonderland,"" who comes to the United States as an elderly woman to receive a honorary degree from Columbia and be celebrated as the model for what Mark Twain called ""the immortal Alice.""  In this film Zach Riley (Aaron Eckhart) has taken his mother's maiden name as his last name because if he goes around as Zachary Pierson people would know that he is the son of T.L. Pierson (Nick Nolte), the author of ""Neverwas,"" and that he was the model for Zachary Small, the young hero of the story.  His father suffered from schizophrenia, depression, and substance abuse, and it was young Zach who found his father's corpse.

Consequently, Zach clearly has good reason to run away from his past, but he has a strange way of doing it.  At the start of this movie Zach, who is a psychiatrist, leaves Cornell to talk his way with Dr. Peter Reed (Hurt) into taking a position at the Millwood Clinic, a residential facility back where he grew up.  In fact, his father had been a patient at Millwood (not that anybody knows that since Zach has changed his name), so Zach has some idea of helping those at the same place where his father was clearly not helped that much.  Zach meets Maggie Blake (Brittany Murphy), who loves his father's book and has a ""Neverwas"" lunch box, but then he also meets Gabriel Finch (McKellan), a patient at Millwood who has not spoken for years.  Finch looks at Zach and speaks to him and we quickly learn that the old man thinks that Zach the psychiatrist is a grown up version of Zachary Small, who has promised to come and rescue him because Gabriel is the King of Neverwas.

At this point the movie presents the irony of Zach treating a patient who's delusion is that he is from the world of his father's book.  However, Stern has several twists as this story plays out, and while I would be loathe to say which particular twist this story would be better without I can say that the cumulative effect might be one of the reasons why this film does not work, but it does not.  This is a stellar cast, but maybe the film is miscast in the key roles, because McKellan is channeling a bit too much Gandalf in the role and the smile Ekhart plasters on his face when he does sessions with the patients seems like a pale imitation of the one that works so well in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thank-You-for-Smoking/dp/B000H0MKOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thank You for Smoking</a>.""  If those two roles do not work, then the film is on the wrong track.  The sense of mystification continues when you look at who is on the other side of the camera because Philip Glass composed the score and the production design is fairly impressive (I especially like the notebooks and other elements of ""Neverwas""), but the sum is considerably less than the equal value of the parts.",1183766400,11,4681,4.876418663303909

8187838,5,B000OZ2CP2,"This appears to be a movie for children, and the trailer would suggest so, but it's a very adult movie.  It's an exploration of a world of escapism from difficult childhoods, of the balance between delusion and fantasy, and of acknowledging people where they're at, not where we expect them to be.  The performances are all stellar, the cinematography beautiful, and the music somewhat haunting.  I would highly recommend it, but just know that it's not for kids.",1522454400,,463,4.910256410256411
