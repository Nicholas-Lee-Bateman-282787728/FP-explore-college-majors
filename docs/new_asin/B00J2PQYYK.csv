6316559,5,B00J2PQYYK,"With the large number of DVD and Blu-Ray releases of ""A Hard Day's Night"" it is easy to get confused.  This is the 2014 release which includes a newly remixed true 5.1-channel audio track (which Giles Martin worked on) as well as a restored original mono audio track (done by Ron Furmanek).  The video has been restored using a 4K process.  Basically this release has the best of the video and audio elements.  The mastering for the discs was performed by Criterion.

You may also see a listing of A Hard Day's Night Blu-Ray that was released in Canada around 2010.  This is a different version that has a 5.1-channel track ""created from"" the restored mono audio.  It was mush and very tough to listen to.  Please don't get fooled with this version.

The new 2014 version has the music audio taken directly from the multitrack master elements as well as the dialog from the restored audio. This should be the definitive version from a long time to come.

Looking forward to hearing this version.",1395187200,458,995,4.634285714285714

6316574,5,B00J2PQYYK,"Dear lord, these are some of the most inane ""reviews"" I've ever seen.  Why do people bother if they have nothing to say or they don't know what they're talking about?

A Hard Day's Night remains as fun and fresh today as the day it came out and took everyone by surprise - the surprise being how fun and fresh it was.  Richard Lester was the absolute perfect choice for director, and The Beatles are just so utterly charming, and the entire supporting cast is brilliantly chosen.

Now, to the point: I'm reviewing - and I know this is crazy - the item that's actually pictured on this page - not a DVD, not some other earlier release, the Criterion special edition, which is, after all, what you'll be purchasing from this item page.  This is a huge upgrade from all previous releases - it looks great and more importantly it sounds great, and with this film visual and audio share equal importance.  Extras are fun although I don't care about them - the film's the thing and this is a stellar presentation.  This is the only version you want.",1519948800,7,1043,4.457894736842105

6316594,5,B00J2PQYYK,"""A Hard Day's Night"" is a sort of documentary film showing what it was like being the Beatles in 1964.  An excellent movie, it catches these four musicians/singers at a moment in time when the phenomenon known as Beatlemania was in its nova stage ... a star about to explode into incredible brilliance.

The four Beatles ... John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr ... were ... at this same time ... at their peak.  They were never more fun ... never more rascally ... never more charming ... never funnier ... never more innocent ... never more likable ... and never more entertaining.

The movie itself was the brainchild of an United Artists executive who approached movie producer Walter Shenson in the Fall of 1963 about making a film about the Beatles.  The film was to be a sort-of ""A Day in the Life of the Beatles"" ... and a comedy.  Shenson agreed, and as preparations were being made for the filming, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were asked to write six songs for the soundtrack ... which they did.  Now a title for the movie was needed, but none of the six new songs seemed to provide a suitable title ... and the production team struggled to come up with a solution.  John Lennon then suggested they use a ""Ringo-ism"" ... one of the many amusing malapropisms that Ringo would often utter ... and ""A Hard Day's Night"" was selected.  A few days later, however, producer Walter Shenson realized that the movie should have a title song to go with the title .... and that evening he asked John and Paul if they could write something.  They could.  The next morning at 8 a.m. ... reading the lyrics ... as they were written ... from the back of match book covers ... John and Paul performed ""A Hard Day's Night"" for Mr. Shenson.

A classic song ... and one of the most beloved of all Beatles songs ... ""A Hard Day's Night"" was written ... on demand ... in just a few short hours.  Truly amazing.  The entire album was written under similar pressures ... with the expectations and deadlines of the movie business ... but John and Paul came through ... with flying colors ... producing what is clearly the best of all the Beatles albums ... despite what the critics say.

The screenplay for ""A Hard Day's Night"" was written by Alun Owen ... and it is a gem.  Crackling with humor and zany antics ... it is one of the very best comedy screenplays ever written.  And ... despite the appearance of spontaneity and improvisation ... the Beatles and the other actors were actually following the script ... almost to the letter..  And ... without this screenplay ... we wouldn't be talking about this film.  The Beatles would have been successful in any movie with just about any script ... but it would have been a throw away film ... watch it once ... maybe twice ... and then never watch it again ... (like ""Help"", ""Yellow Submarine"", and ""Magical Mystery Tour"") ... but people have watched ""A Hard Day's Night"" ten, fifteen, and some twenty times ... and have never tired of it.  This is due to the high quality of the screenplay ... for which we are indebted to the brilliant writing of Mr. Alun Owen.

Veteran Irish comedian Wilfrid Bramble was brought in to play Paul's grandfather .... and he is wonderful ... simply wonderful.  He was given the best lines in the movie ... which he delivers with expert wit and sarcasm ... and he gets funnier as the movie goes on.

Filming for ""A Hard Day's Night"" began on March 2, 1964 ... and lasted seven weeks.  A shoestring budget did not prevent this movie from becoming a classic ... and for those people not fortunate enough to have lived during Beatlemania, watching ""A Hard Day's Night"" is the next best thing.  A truly excellent film.",1503964800,,3712,4.520958083832335

6316615,5,B00J2PQYYK,"NOTE:  Previous to buying this Blu-Ray I had the Miramax deluxe boxed set (ASIN: B0000542D2) which I paid a good chunk of change for back in 2002 and it was (still is) a quite decent experience.

2014 release BLU-RAY VIDEO QUALITY:  When I played the Blu-Ray, **  at first ** I didn't see any ""immediate"" earth shattering difference.  Then, a few minutes in, I start noticing things.  John Lennon's left sideburn in the early train car sequence is not trimmed evenly.  The eye pupils refocusing on the stuffy old man passenger's face as he processes feeling hurt / indignant ruffled after our Beatle heroes leave the car after toying with him. I can make out the lettering on Ringo's radio.  I notice the Pepsi-Cola logo on a pop bottle.  I notice the upholstery pattern in the train seat.  I notice the fabric pattern in Paul's suit.  The lines in certain actors faces, groups of combed hairs in the Beatles and other actors, etc.  The ""Ramirez"" guitar logo inside George's acoustic guitar.  The pocket watch on Victor Spinetti's video desk, etc.  These are all subtleties and they may be visually there in the older DVD but for the first time I ** noticed ** them and I believe it's the extra detail of the Blu-Ray that makes this possible.  It adds to realism and my enjoyment of the movie.

AUDIO QUALITY:  I can't say that I notice any major difference in the audio quality compared to the 2002 Miramax DVD which also had good audio.

SUMMARY:  If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Beatle fan and can afford to re-buy this, yeah it's worth it.  I watch this particular movie probably once a year or two anyway and I do replay scenes that I like.  That being said dear Beatle fans: You are not suffering if you have the old 2002 Miramax DVD version, the story will still be told and enjoyed, but the video on this is a notch maybe two notches better - in the realm of fine detail and subtleties.

Techno stuff:  I have 60"" LG Plasma 1080p screen and $300 Sony Blu-Ray player, Pioneer 7.1 receiver.  NOTE:  I see mention on Amazon that the B2 version won't play in US.  I can't speak to that.  What I can tell you for sure is:  1.  I live in the U.S.  2.  My copy says it's ""Region B"" and the UPC on my copy that plays in the US on US region equipment is:  UPC 9344256010514  Edition is listed as Umbrella Entertainment  (umbrellaent.com.au) Full HD 1080.

What I don't get:  Why does it have an ""M"" (Mature) audiences rating for ""Low level coarse language"".  I mean there is nothing tamer or squeaky clean by today's standards than this movie.

P.S.  2 of my favorite moments:  ""That's dead grotty!""  ""I'll bet you're a good swimmer!""",1496534400,7,2631,4.4778012684989426

This is a movie to own, because it reveals something new with every viewing and is unfailingly exhilarating. The Beatles changed their world, and still have a message for ours.

I just reveled in the fun and the great music. But those who want to know where it came from will appreciate the little book that comes with the DVD. There's commentary about the place of this film in pop culture, its influences, its role in a class society, and how the documentary flavor was achieved. The director's creative vision is contrasted with his exuberant, deliberate lack of planning. For serious film buffs, there are factoids about cameras and film type used, techniques of shooting and editing, and the behind- the-scenes lowdown on specific scenes.

The production values of this DVD are stellar. Current technology was used to great effect to clean up the quality of aging video and audio.",1489449600,13,998,4.852941176470588

6316640,4,B00J2PQYYK,"Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a musical comedy starring the Beatles at the initial explosion of 'Beatlemania.' The movie focuses on several days in the lives of the members while in England, including recording music and a concert at the end with the requisite screaming pubescent girls.

While the Beatles were before my time, they were indeed great. There was something about the chemistry of the members that produced catchy hit after hit during their decade together from 1960-1970. When ""A Hard Day's Night"" (the movie) was released in the summer of '64, simultaneously with the album of the same name, they had only three albums of material released in two years, 1963-1964. The producers wanted to get a movie out before their popularity waned, like practically every other pop rock artist or group. But their fame was not to decline, as their appeal spread to young and older alike. They would release four more movies before breaking up, if you include the animated ""Yellow Submarine.""

""A Hard Day's Night"" is considered a cult movie, and I can see why. It captures the group while they're not much more than kids, still in shock about their skyrocketing success. The best parts, of course, are the music numbers, which play like what would later become known as music videos. Seriously, any time one of their hooky ditties starts playing your attention perks up and your feet & hands start moving in delight. It's the in between scenes that are problematic. You might enjoy these sequences more than me if you're enamored by the members. I'm not; I just like their music. I suppose it doesn't help that these episodes are plagued by mumbling dialogue with the corresponding English accent, not to mention British humor from the time period that I mostly don't 'get.'

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot entirely in England.

If you are a Beatles fan, like me, YOU MUST GET THIS!!
Not only do you have a very nicely done package, with a beautiful nice booklet and sleeve, you have 2 DVDs and one nice Blu-ray.

For specific special features here besides the 4K feature, they are listed in the specifics section above. I loved all of them!
""""In Their Own Voices"" was outstanding!
""Anatomy of a Style""
""You Can't Do That"": The Making of A Hard Day's Night
Things They Said Today
Richard Lester
""The Beatles: The Road To a Hard Day's Night""

6316704,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I just finished watching the Blu-ray version of this movie and wow, Criterion really did a great job with this movie, both the video and audio are outstanding! The picture is incredibly sharp and clean and the soundtrack in both the stereo and 5.1 versions sound excellent. If you do have a 5.1 A/V system, take advantage and by all means, CRANK IT UP!

I'll admit, it's been many years since I last saw this movie. One reason I bought this Blu-ray was because I've been reading Geoff Emerick's excellent book ""Here There and Everywhere, My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles"". I'm 53 years old and a longtime Beatles fan but since I started reading Mr. Emerick's book, I've been going back and rediscovering some Beatles songs and movies I hadn't heard/seen in years. My favorite scene is probably the aerial view of the boys running around a field and acting crazy as the song ""Can't Buy Me Love"" plays on.

I bought the three disc version of this movie which also has plenty of bonus features. Whether you're a hard-core Beatles fan or not, I highly recommend this Blu-ray. For those hard-core fans, consider the three disc version for those bonus features.",1476144000,,1165,4.678048780487805

6316713,4,B00J2PQYYK,"I had tremendous fun watching the young Beatles as they were 50 odd years ago.  This snap shot of the foursome comes before they were more popular than Jesus.  At the time they were simply the most popular pop stars in the known universe.  They still had a youthful charm.  The boys had no hard edges at all, just smiles and astonishing energy.  The pop tunes they seemed to be able to pour out of themselves at will still cause our heads to bob and our feet to tap.  But most of all the tunes and the movie make us smile along with them, smiles of happiness.
  Wilfrid Brambell played Paul's grand father as a bemused opportunist.  He stared in a long running British TV show that was copied in the USA as Sanford and Son and achieved equal longevity and fame.
  The film is honest fun to watch, the tunes lively and the entire thing is likable.",1468281600,2,846,4.291139240506329

And we have the beatles in a truly classic movie on blu ray.  There's actually three discs in this set.  The only way this could be better is if someday they put it out on a 4k disc. , which now exist and are for sale. with just a few titles.  SOO.  even then , because of cost , the excellence of this release means, that you really can just be satisfied with this one!

The three disc set also contains a DVD version of the movie, DVD extras including a making of the film, several documentaries, interviews, Richard Lester's short film that won him the job and so much more.  Also comes with a booklet that give more information about the various aspects of the film.

6316868,5,B00J2PQYYK,"This is a mad-cap, whimsical insight into a day in the life of 'John' 'Paul' 'George' and
'Ringo' --'The Fab Four'
The film was made at the very height of the groups popularity, this their first film was of
course also a great vehicle to both promote their music and naturally give the groups
large fan-base the opportunity to see their 'idols' on the big-screen.
A day in the life ...running from the screaming hoards, a train journey which introduces
'Paul's' pretend Grandfather played by 'Wilfred Brambell' (Steptoe) one or two studio
sessions, 'press-calls' and interviews winding up with a TV filmed stage-show..........
plenty of banter and several comic sketches, of course the reality was during those
crazy days the four were always in the public eye.
The film, crazy, madcap, and yes...........great fun, coupled with the memorable songs,
at the end of the day ....it's 'THE BEATLES' in truth that's all that matters.

6316920,4,B00J2PQYYK,"There's a scene in here where the boys are on the commuter train and a WW II Generation (who Tom Brokaw would later call ""The Greatest Generation"") type fellow passenger complains about their radio. Given what a portable transistor radio was like in those days--hardly a boombox with its tiny speaker--this guy obviously just wanted a confrontation with ""some young snots"". The passenger says in a crack-the-whip tone of voice; ""I fought a war for your sort"". Lennon is unimpressed; ""Bet you're sorry you won."". Until I saw that scene when this film ran in first-run theaters, I had thought it was exclusively an ""American thing"" to borrow Jim Crow mannerisms when you came upon young people listening to Buddy Holly or Frankie Avalon on a tinny barely-audible radio. But I guess the Brits had their own version of it. Too bad that back then some of us couldn't have seen five decades into the future and done up some signs saying ""Young Lives Matter"".",1427760000,,952,4.775757575757575

But don't expect to learn anything new about the individuals.  They are playing themselves, not being themselves.  I'd rather hang with a good interview of John, say.

As for the DVD release, Criterion certainly did an excellent job restoring the picture and sound.  Everything is crisp and lovely and the details in the images really pop.  My one complaint is the cropping -- why is it so hard for distributors to release an uncropped version of this classic?

6316972,5,B00J2PQYYK,"Director Richard Lester's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (UK-1964) is a classic, the first-ever film about a single rock group. In gritty b&w, it has the appearance of a documentary, yet is all cleverly scripted by Welshman turned Liverpudlian Alun Owen. The four Beatles, having no movie experience, are all given brief lines of dialogue, and with the many songs written for this project it all works marvelously.

Among the seemingly ad lib remarks are some words the Fabs never would've said. Examples: Ringo's ""It's me neb,"" meaning ""nose."" But neb is an Irish slang. Owen thought ""grotty"" was a common term arround Liverpool, so he hands it to George. Again none of the boys ever used this in life, yet after the picture's debut ""grotty"" (for grotesque) instantly entered the vernacular of Mod Britain.

By traveling with them on tour, Owen did pick up some of their actual expressions, like ""he's very clean"" and ""I fought the war for your sort."" They also told him a number of stories that led to script ideas, but the main plot device came from Owen just observing how regimented and oppressive life was for this quartet of rock stars, carefully guarded and herded by manager and assistants from hotel rooms to rehearsals to concerts. The super-popular Beatles had no private lives in those crazy early days, thus the story of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT as crafted by Owen carefully builds to a point where the four rebel and flee down a fire escape, all for a brief fling with freedom.

NOTE: the scene where the boys barely escape from a mob of screeching kids actually happened. Dick Lester just rolled the camera as chaos reigned.

Although truly of it's time, this great musical film remains a fascinating viewing experience, especially on the big screen. And the music? Beatleific!",1424390400,,1775,4.80983606557377

6317266,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I have an interesting history with the Beatles and their work.  In my early years, I disregarded them completely as old music, though it wasn't until I became a teenager that I stopped viewing stuff that was older than me as bad simply due to its age.  Course thats simply the idiocy of youth at work.  Ive actually changed my tune completely and been a big fan of the Beatles for the past seven years.  (Why yes, that does match up with when Across the Universe came out.  Funny that.)  However, despite that, I had not seen their 1964 film classic, A Hard Days Night.  Id heard about it and Id seen clips here and there, but it had simply been missed by my movie watching self.  So, when I saw the movie had shown up on Criterion, I couldn't pass up the opportunity.

Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, A Hard Days Night is a rather odd musical by typical musical standards.  Structured almost like a documentary, the film focuses on the Fab Four,  John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, as they go about what was likely a typical day for them with a single difference.  Paul has to watch over his grandfather, John McCartney (Wilfred Brambell), a real mixer  and clean old man who causes chaos wherever he goes with the four frequently having to clean up his messes.  The most notable one being when he uses Ringos dissatisfaction with his role as the butt monkey of the group to cause him to leave minutes before they have to play a live televised show.  After a rather well acted scene (for a given definition of acting since Ringo has stated that he was severely hung-over during the filming of said scene) where Ringo wanders along a riverside, Ringo is thrown in jail and only rescued when the others find him and lead the police on a hilarious chase sequence.  However the film is full of wonderful scenes. For example, the scene when, after escaping their manager Norm (Norman Rossington), the Beatles frolick in a field to the tune of Cant Buy Me Love, or the opening scene where the four are chased by their adoring and slightly disturbing mob of fans to the title song.  In fact, the opening of the film with George Harrisons legendary opening chord is one of the best openings to a film that I have ever seen.  Obviously, the performances themselves stand out as well.  The Beatles were, and are, the best at what they did and the performances clearly show that., even with the lip-synching.

Oddly enough, this film was not supposed to be a success.  United Artists was much more focused on the soundtrack, hoping to get it out before Capitol Records could release their material, and expecting to lose money on the film.  However, thanks to Owens script, Lesters direction, and the Beatles own sarcastic wit, the film was an instant success. (Though coming out at the height of Beatlemania may have helped that).  The movie helped establish the Beatles individual personalities in the public consciousness and that served to help the layout of the movie, especially given the uniform look of the group at the time.  John Lennon was the sarcastic ass, Paul McCartney was the sensible cute one, George Harrison was the reserved quiet one, and Ringo was the one everyone else made fun of.

The movie is expertly shot, making us feel like were part of the gang one second and switching to grand sweeping shots the next, each shot fitting the tone.  In fact, the performance scenes were pretty much responsible for the way pop music would be shot from then on.  The movie has a madcap energy to it and when rewatching it, I noticed jokes that I had missed the previous time.  I will admit to being very iffy on a lot of comedy, but this film won me over.  It helped that I have a soft spot for a good sarcastic remark and the film has those in spades, especially in the interview scene.  The music is, obviously, great and always fit the scene its played over, which is more than you can say for some modern musicals.  Despite coming out 50 years ago, the film has not aged at all and is still just as watchable as it probably was all those years ago.  However, at the same time, it serves as a perfect time capsule of that moment when the conservatism and stoicness of the 50s switched over to the liberation and fun of the 60s.

The film does drag a bit during the Ringo solo scene and the screaming girls, while accurate, can get annoying.  However, those are minor flaws and the film rightfully earns its place as one of the best musical films around.",1408924800,,4508,4.517879161528977
6317267,5,B00J2PQYYK,Do I really need to say anything about this fabulous movie/time capsule?  It's the Beatles at their youngest and best.  The blue ray is outstanding and a bonus is the 5.1 surround sound track mix.  It doesn't get any better at any price.,1408924800,,237,4.465116279069767

6317307,2,B00J2PQYYK,"Just finished watching it and it is the best of the remasterings/revisions done in the last 20 years in terms of cleaning it up.

First: this may be the best video detail (sharp lines, no dust, better definition) restoration that has ever been made of this movie, but not the truest video image. The audio dialogue is also excellent and the extras are a good collection of separate releases over the years. Criterion claims that they recreated the original aspect ratio, but to do it, they cut off large sections from the top and bottom of the image. There is slightly more on the right and left, but it is not what was originally produced. For those that have never seen the original, you will be pleased with it, but you will never `feel' the excitement of the original because the songs are implants.

The overall experience is disappointing purely because of the tampered music, which is a very big part of this film. The latest geniuses in restoration/remastering could not resist the temptation to ""improve"" upon the Mona Lisa. The techies worked really hard on this film to both restore it and change it - Yes: change it. They add new sounds in the songs and make [yet, another] effort to make the music appealing to Beatles fan's children's ears. None of the music is from the original film. As a result, you get studio-remastered overlays of the songs. They sound sanitized and out of place, because they are. It's as though you muted the movie, during the songs, and put your CD in to play along with it. It is that noticeable. I found myself cringing when I knew a song was coming up.

You can see what they did at this link:  http://www.studiodaily.com/2014/08/beatlemania-in-black-white-restoring-a-hard-days-night-in-4k/

This is particularly evident throughout the concert at the end. It's like watching an MTV version. The audience involvement is seen, but rarely heard. The original had the full audience involvement and this made it exciting. Now, it's kind of boring because they covered up most of the audience involvement and it's like listening to a CD. If you want a flavor of how it originally sounded, listen to the ""You Can't Do That"" bonus. As you can hear, in that, it's not a perfect studio digitally remastered recording. It's not supposed to be. IT'S A CONCERT.

Further, they added the equivalent of a laugh track. They felt that certain sounds should be heard throughout the movie. Again' it's most noticeable in the songs where the sound effects fade it in and out like a laugh track. Some examples: The original opening, where ""A Hard Day's Night"" plays, has screaming fading in and out. It was not there in the original. ""I Should Have Known Better"" should begin with dialogue ""1 for you , 2 for me , 3 for him"" and ending with Ringo laughing, but those are all covered. In fact, they seemed to have worked so hard at trying to force-fit their revised songs onto the audio track that they started getting sloppy about it. On the mono, most of the dialogue that overlapped the songs is covered up and on other audio options it's sporadic. Sometimes they didn't even bother to sync the audio. Pure carelessness.

So, 5 stars for the video, dialogue and extras, but zero stars for the music.",1408233600,19,3224,4.736185383244207

I was a little bit surprised that I still love it now, but I do.  That movie formed an impression in my mind about who each of the Beatles were as people, and that impression was of just how likeable they all were.  The whole film it great, but watching them sing is still a pleasure I can't describe.  Maybe it's because it takes me back to a happier, less complicated time in my life.  The ""good old days"" are always good simply because you were younger at the time. The 'making of'' documentary is fascinating. I can recommend this film to anyone of any age.

6317375,5,B00J2PQYYK,"Richard Lester's A Hard Day's Night has always been one of my all-time favorite films; it's not particularly well-written but it's a great look inside the wild and raucous lifestyle that The Beatles had (and had trail them wherever they went) during the Sixties.

So, assuming that you're considering buying this Criterion bluray for the same reasons I did, I'll just go ahead and tell you it's worth every penny.  Even not considering the extras (which this release has plenty of), the *quality* is phenomenal.  I've never seen The Beatles as they were so clearly.  This should be the reason why you buy this.  Everything else is bonus.

If you want a visual testament to the heyday of bowl-cut, hair-shaking, cig-smoking, UK-rocking, sex-pot sensations that were The Beatles in the mid-Sixties, this is the ultimate piece for your collection.",1407542400,,844,5.0359712230215825

He was out in the back yard, headphones on, listening to Beatles music. When he opened the dvd he was just as excited to receive the movie as he was the helicopter we bought him. Now, he may not get the nuances in this revamped film, which make it even more sublime than in past incarnations. The film is so crystal clear, it seems the boys could be jumping out at you. The music is so magnificent  you can hear bits not heard on prior releases...that, by the way, goes for dialogue, too. You look at one another and say, ""did you hear that?

This Criterion version lives up to the Criterion name.  You have a choice of three different sound options.  Mono.  Stereo.  5.1. All put together by the brilliant Giles Martin; who worked on the soundtrack of ""Love""; with his Father Sir George.  I've interviewed both Giles and Sir George.  Giles is his own man!  Great, great sound!

The Blu Ray is absolute pristine as is the regular version. I mean THE BEST!!!

The liner notes will take quite some time to read; but if you want to know technically why this might be one of the greatest DVD releases ever, you'll want to read it.  I read it slowly as it is deep.  I love it.  They feel you really want to know why the quality is so good. And they really explain how they did it.  Also the extras are great.

6317459,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I remembered standing in line with my big blue ticket to get into see Hard Day's Night at the movie theater in East Liberty in Pittsburgh in the summer of 1964 as i was turning 14.  Of course, i loved the movie then, but as i was not a particularly sophisticated 14 year old, i always had to wonder if the movie was simply a high-spirited teen movie with great music or actually a first rate movie apart from the fact that it starred the Beatles. I'd seen the movie once or twice since then, but not for quite awhile.

Well, it is so satisfying that the movie i loved back then has stood the test of time as a truly lovely film.  The Criterion blu-ray upgrade in audio is wonderful, but it is the remastering of the visual aspect that shines here.  The picture quality is as crisp as the witty Alun Owens dialog.  Dick Lester's sensibilities bring out the best in young men with no training in acting and who, less than two years earlier were little more than boys carrying the diseases marking their time on the streets, clubs, and alleys of the Reeperbahn of Hamburg.

Pure Joy, wonderfully mythologized, and presented in a masterful remastering.  The accompanying essays as well as some of the video extras are wonderful.  And though the Running, Jumping, Standing Still film is not exactly a masterwork.  The chance to see an early Dick Lester piece (aside from It's Trad, Dad with another 1963 English teen favorite, Helen Shapiro) is nice as well.

Over the hill Beatlemaniacs, like me, will be overwhelmed by this Valentine from the folks at the Criterion Collection.  But even those who just like actually clever films should enjoy this.  After all, ya can't learn everything from just reading a boooooook.",1406937600,,1714,4.62046204620462

6317532,4,B00J2PQYYK,"Finally appearing on blu-ray after an absurd lengthy wait, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is inarguably one of the most important watershed moments in the history of popular music.  The Ed Sullivan appearances introduced America to The Beatles, AHDN further expanded the explosion worldwide.  Bursting at the seams with classic music that remarkably still sounds fresh today, beautiful classic black and white cinematography that is pleasing to the eye, dry British humor that's not too stuffy and still relatable, this film has it all.  But ultimately it's the personalities and artistry of the Fab Four that propel the movie beyond mere rock fantasy.  An absolute five star movie if there ever was one, required viewing for anyone in love with music.

The 4k restoration breathes new life into this classic, a pristine print with deep blacks and sharp contrast throughout, fantastic when blown through a quality home projector and sound system, this blu-ray rocks.  My main issue is with the bloated wasteful packaging:  the absolutely unnecessary dvd disc, sorry people but blu-ray should be the de-facto format now.  The extras disc (in standard dvd format again) that Beatle fans have seen before and first-timers may find mildly entertaining at best.  The 5.1 sound mix was somewhat disappointing and poorly engineered, at least to my ears.  Worst of all is the ridiculously lengthy booklet featuring bloated hyperbole on the film's history and director Richard Lestor's interview that reads like a cameraman's technical bible on how to lens a picture.  So needless and so boring.  I would have rather heard the opinions from contemporaries of the British Invasion and those who were inspired by the inventive spirit of The Beatles.  The only intriguing new feature is the breezy commentary track featuring those behind the camera involved with the film making process, wonderful to hear those cheerful British voices providing unique insight into the production.

""A Hard Day's Night"" will always be one of my all time favorite movies, always fresh with every viewing.  Eliminate all the wasteful extra packaging, issue this as a single disc blu-ray and it's an easy five star package.  First time viewers, especially the younger generation now being exposed to this most important group, are in for an fantastic experience.  Bloated packaging aside, this movie easily deserves my absolute highest recommendation.",1406505600,2,2410,5.267015706806283

were the originals. They were not copying anyone because they were first. Look at the BILLBOARD

This is sadly repeated again during the closing TV show collage. Unreal, and no excuse for the POOR quality control. This has been verified with three different sets and players and is found on both the Blu Ray and the DVD in both the newly mixed 5.1 and the 2.0 stereo mix. Other than that I just wished Giles Martin had opened up the mix to really push more separation into all five channels; as it is now (like other reviewers have  pointed out) the DTS is so bland I had to keep checking my system to see if all was still functioning.

6317600,4,B00J2PQYYK,"Shot during the insanity of Beatlemania, ""A Hard Day's Night"" captures atmosphere of The Beatles during the early days of their popularity.

In the hands of another director, the film could easily have been just another cheap rock 'n' roll flick designed to separate fans from their money. Instead Richard Lester, Alun Owen and the band created a witty ""clean"" version of their lives during this time.

""A Hard Day's Night"" remains a fun, entertaining film because it appears that the ""boys"" are being themselves. The film has a fly-on-the-wall quality to it during their this early part of their career and, although this is a fictionalized version (and cleaned up one to boot)of what it was like in the early days for The Beatles, it's a very entertaining one. The Beatles are joined by some terrific British movie and TV vets in various roles. It's easy to see why the band wanted to work with Lester again (for ""Help!"") as their humor was very much in synch with Lester's.

Criterion has done a superb job of updating the film for Blu-ray (and DVD) with a sharp, beautifully restored version of the film. Although I dislike the cardboard packaging (this is a feature of a lot of Criterion releases of late and I honestly hate it), the booklet that is included is generous and features an excerpt from an interview that Richard Lester did when the script for the film was published and he did a scene-by-scene commentary for the script.

The remixed 5.1 audio (the original mono is included as well) is nicely done by Giles Martin giving added depth to the sound however this is one issue--as part of an attempt to fix the sound for ""If I Fell""  Paul goes out of synch for a brief period. I'm assuming it was to fix it although Giles Martin indicates its on the master tape. It wasn't however n earlier issues. (It occurs around the 34 minute mark). As a result, I'm docking this a star util its either fixed or we get an adequate explanation.

We get a lot of terrific special features here but, unfortunately, not all of the special features from the Miramax DVD show up here (including George Martin's comments on the songs for the film). First up we have ""You Can't Do That"" the 1994 doc on the making of the film featuring fellow musicians, fans and critics discussing the film's impact. It's hosted by Phil Collins (who had a bit part as an extra in the film) and is presented in standard definition.

Carried over from the DVD is the commentary track which features 15 of the cast and crew discussing the making of the film. This approach allows each to share insights during key scenes they were involved in.

Next up we have ""Things We Said Today"" a nearly 40 minute retrospective documentary about the making of the film featuring George Martin and various members of the production crew discussing the making of the film.

We get Lester's ""The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film"" made in collaboration with The Goons.

New to this set are ""Anatomy of a Style"" and ""The Beatles: The Road to A Hard Day's Night"". ""Anatomy"" gives us an analysis of 5 scenes from the film pointing out why they work so well. ""In Their Own Voices"" features The Beatles themselves discussing the film from archive interviews as various stills and scenes play. It's the closest that we ever get to the band discussing the film.

""Road"" features Beatles historian and biographer Mark Lewisohn in a nearly 30 minute interview where he discusses a variety of things including how the band nearly broke up prior to Brian Epstein becoming their manager because their career wasn't going anywhere (also mentioned in Lewisohn's excellent book THE BEATLES: ALL THESE YEARS- TUNE IN VOLUME 1).

Finally we get a two disc DVD that reflects the contents of the Blu-ray as part of this combo package.

While it would have been nice to have ALL the special features from the previous edition, this new, remastered edition features some new material that will be of interest to long time fans of both The Beatles and director Richard Lester.",1405728000,8,4020,4.6770538243626065
6317601,5,B00J2PQYYK,"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT: A (MOSTLY!) TECHNICAL REVIEW OF CRITERION'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY BLU-RAY RELEASE!

The Feature Film:

An Almost Ideal Black & White Situation 'Picturewise':
Visually speaking, the Criterion Blu-Ray Presentation is positively STUNNING, with amazing depth and clarity, that to my eyes looks akin to viewing a near pristine 35mm Print! This is very simply, the best Visual presentation of this Classic that I've ever seen!

With that said, there are possibly a couple of visually related minor caveats. Upon rechecking my 2002 Miramax DVD, I noticed slightly less cropping on the top of the Screen during the A HARD DAY'S NIGHT Opening Titles at its 1.66:1 Aspect Ratio, than there is with Criterion's 1.75:1 Aspect Ratio Setup, though the former also has marginal cropping on the sides. From what I've read, Films during the early to mid 1960's were commonly released in the UK at the 1.66:1 Aspect Ratio, while 1.75:1 was more common in the U.S. during that same period. Thus, it appears that for the New Restoration, the U.S. Version prevailed. The second is only a possible caveat because I'm not certain that the A WALTER SHENSON PRODUCTION Introduction Card that only appears on the Miramax Version is original, though to my eyes, it does appear to be. In any case, I will state that in my opinion, the Criterion Version does seem to begin a tad abruptly (Only for the lack of any Pre-Opening!), though not enough to be jarring.

Overall Visual Evaluation: 9.5/10. I would have preferred the UK Aspect, and the original United Artists Opening Logo would have also been a nice touch. However, even with the very slight Aspect Ratio issue, I still consider Criterion's overall Visual presentation of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT to be the best (Especially the Blu-Ray Version!) that I've ever seen on Home Video.

Get Back 'The Sound':
If the overall superior Visual presentation isn't enough to persuade owners of previous A HARD DAY'S NIGHT Video Releases to purchase the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD versions, in my opinion, as great as its Visuals are, it's the restored Audio that really makes this edition a must purchase for even this Classic's most casual Fans!

Regarding the Audio Restoration, I cannot fully comment on the 5.1 Surround Sound (Though it does sound great on our Flat Screen TV!), as our Entertainment Setup lacks in that area, and where A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is concerned, I really don't care since it wasn't originally released in that state, anyway! What I do care about however, is the obvious painstaking effort that was taken in restoring the Soundtrack to its original Theatrically run state! Because I only saw this Film on TV once in the 1970's when I was 12 years old, I had no real memory of the original Soundtrack and just assumed the Restorations from the 1980's on got this right, and never considered that some sounds originally present (Such as Screaming from Beatlemaniacs!) were eliminated by the Stereo Overdubbing, though the Overdubs themselves were obvious enough. Besides the 5.1 Surround, there are also Stereo 2.0 and original Monaural Sound options. Big kudos go to George Martin's Son, Gil for his considerable effort behind this ""Fab"" Audio Restoration!

Overall Audio Evaluation: 10/10. I simply cannot see (Or rather, hear!) how the Audio Restoration could have been made any better than it has here! Back are the Screams that have been missing at least since the now notorious 1980's Audio Restorations, and gone are the in retrospect, annoying ""Roll Offs"" that accompanied the Stereo Musical Overdubs! Also, the fact that this set provides three Audio options, including the original Monophonic for the purists, in addition to the 2.0 Stereo and 5.1 Surround selections, should satisfy all auditory preferences!

The Bonus Features:

I very much appreciate the inclusion of the 1994 Phil Collins Hosted ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT"": THE MAKING OF A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, as its absence from the 2002 Miramax DVD Release was one of my biggest disappointments, along with the lack of a Commentary Track, despite some promotional ads that stated the inclusion of one at the time of the Miramax Release! Could this have been the present Commentary Track (Taken from material produced in 2002!) that's now included on the new Criterion Release that perhaps didn't make the Miramax 2 DVD Set because it couldn't be prepared in time? Speaking of the Miramax Version, its original THINGS THEY SAID TODAY documentary also appears within the Criterion Set. One thing the Miramax Set has over Criterion's are the many exclusive A HARD DAY'S NIGHT Cast Member Video Profiles (My guess is Criterion didn't have the rights for these!), which unfortunately means that it won't be easy for me to part with the former!

Probably my biggest disappointment regarding the Bonus Features is the awful looking (In my opinion!) deleted ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT"" Film Clip that appears at the end of the Phil Collins Hosted Documentary. While I'll give benefit of the doubt to the possibility that an original Widescreen Version no longer exists (Or perhaps was never cropped from the Matte 1.37:1 Aspect, as it wasn't ultimately included within the Film?), did this really have to be made to look as though it had been put through the Video equivalent of a primitive Microsoft Paint Program? I would have been quite happy to have this in its original state, instead. YEECH!

One item that didn't make the Criterion Set is the ""I'll Cry Instead"" Prologue that was first played in Theaters during A HARD DAY'S NIGHT'S 1982 Re-release run. I have read that Richard Lester apparently didn't like this song and that was supposedly why it didn't make the Film's Soundtrack (Though it is on the UK Album Soundtrack.) the first time out. Perhaps this was left off the 2014 issue in order to get the Director's approval? I would also rather have seen the original 1964 UK and U.S. Theatrical Trailers be included in addition to, or instead of the 2000 and 2014 Trailers. This might also have been a good place for the aforementioned prologue.

The Bonus Features that were specifically prepared for this set are well put together and in my opinion, make for worthwhile viewing, with ""IN THEIR OWN VOICES"" being especially insightful!

Overall Bonus Features Evaluation: 9/10.

Overall Evaluation: 9.5/10
For those Beatlephiles who think that they don't need the Criterion Blu-Ray or even DVD because they already own a prior DVD/Blu-Ray issue seriously ought to rethink this stance! This isn't just another run of the mill, heck it's an Anniversary, so we'll reissue this and make a few quick bucks! This Restoration (Unlike a lot of others!) actually richly deserves to be referred to in that fashion! 50 years on, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT finally looks AND sounds as it should!

Simply put, I cannot recommend this set highly enough!

By the way, the Blu-Ray/DVD Set also includes an 80 Page Booklet that has some great Black & White and Color Photos, valuable information regarding the Video and Audio Transfers, and a 55 Page Section that contains a 1970 interview with A HARD DAY'S NIGHT Director Richard Lester!",1405728000,2,7115,4.95138306789606

At most, 3.0 would be sufficient. The U.S. re-issue soundtrack CD has better stereo sound. An old Beatles film, it is a good insight into what the Beatles had to put up with outside of the recording studio, when doing live performances, and just getting to them. This movie makes it clear why they gave up live concerts as a group. The extras are pretty kool also.

6317638,4,B00J2PQYYK,"Looked at in the cold light of day, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT has dated badly.  Many of the gags fall flat on their face, while the visual style seems artificially jumpy, as director Richard Lester makes a labored attempt to emphasize the Beatles' liberated life.  In terms of film history, however, the film occupies a seminal position; not only does it provide a record of the Beatles in performance, but it makes a conscious attempt to explain the Beatlemania phenomenon.  The Fab Four not only introduced different musical styles into the Britpop world, but they were representatives of a new, swinging way of life that contrasted starkly with what had gone before.  They were happy-go-lucky, free, not frightened to express themselves, and hedonistic - as seen, for instance, in the ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence where they gambol about on a school playing-field, shot from above by director Lester.  In historical terms, the film offers a valuable portrait of mid-Sixties London, especially the contrast between 'old' and 'new' values.  In one sequence the Beatles get into an argument with a city gent (Richard Vernon), who tries to stop them playing their transistor radio in the belief that, as a regular traveler on the train, he is somehow superior to them.  Needless to say John Lennon immediately exposes the stupidity of such claims.  The film is full of experimental visual styles, from the speeded-up chase sequence as the Fab Four are pursued by the London constabulary, to the rapid intercutting between the Beatles in performance and their adoring fans in the audience screaming themselves hoarse,  And then there are the songs, which remain as fresh and original half a century on as they did when they were premiered.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT demands to be watched by anyone interested in social and popular music history, as well as Beatles fans young and old.",1404777600,4,1869,4.961538461538462

Lester takes elements of European Cinema , Television & Surrealism, and Cinema Verity and with this combination practically invents "" Pop Art "" of the highest caliber.
  It may seems like The Beatles Film , This is True. However the real credit finally has gone to Mr Lester. This has finally been re balanced.

6317664,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I'm only posting the point I haven't seen here though it may be and I missed it.  EVERYONE reading this knows what this is, and to a large extent, how it was done, both THEN and NOW.  In a way though, I don't because NEITHER myself nor my wife had EVER seen or heard this before last night.  So I know nothing of all the 'how terrible it was before' stuff.  How is it now for a complete Newbie?  Well... I'd say somewhere around ""Very Good"" but below excellent.  Yea, it's B&W that's just baseline info.  Most of the comedy is slapstick and some is (by today's standard) 'mildly irreverent'.  I'm sure the soundtrack improvements have made it funnier cause you can actually hear every major and mild insult that is thrown around, rapid-fire by 60's standards.  Probably why people liked it so much.  Pacing was madhouse compared to nearly everything most people had ever seen.  And it doesn't seem to drag, really, even by modern standards.  Since we'd never seen it before we got some LOL moments which pleasantly surprised me.  I knew (from my older sister who saw it a bunch of times when it came out) what was going to happen but my wife almost flipped her recliner at the Ringo's Raincoat gag.  That's very well pulled off indeed...
So I ordered it not for nostalgia value, but because Beatles' Catalog Audio Upgrades are the 'holy grail' for which I surely will search  my entire current lifespan.  I knew going in that many of the songs had to be slowed down to match the film for technical difficulties that are as lost to history as Close'n'Plays.  OK, I wondered... how's that going to affect the PITCH of the music and singers?  Will George Harrison sound like The Lurch Who Lunched On Liverpool?
I needn't have worried so much.  Probably Giles Martin took a sledgehammer to EMI's remaining analogue deck the day before work started, then told the brass that he'd have to do it all in the digital domain.  And that would save them money anyways... it's all good...
So to our collective delight (Charles & Di we are!) the songs ARE ever so slightly slowed, but the PITCH is correct!  And the song mixes/film matches are, to at least the previously uninitiated, spot on and just what they seemingly should be.  In other words for audio, calling it a must have is like saying you need silverware at a new restaurant.  God the sound is Divine (if you'll pardon the irreverence).
I can think of no possible further improvement that's possible for these Beatle numbers, short of a complete, catalog remix to 5.1 from the session masters, with post production approval from George & John on the Other Side.
P.S. on 7/5/14:
Sorry I forgot to mention IF you were wondering...  The stereo mixes on this version of AHDN are new, like the 5.1s.  You don't get ping-pong 'Beatles Stereo' ripping your attention back and forth from one side of the screen to the other.  It's a fairly modern (remember Giles Martin only had 2 or 4 tracks of information to use with any of these songs) immersive stereo field showing appropriate reverence for the original intent but 'drawing less attention to itself' than the crude 2-channel releases put out in the 60's.
another P.S. on 7/6/14:
VERY sorry but I must post a correction...  These song remixes ARE in fact slowed in both PACE and PITCH.  Giles Martin has said it himself.  He did not use digital audio editing to restore the pitch.  He stated that such can be DONE, but it is problematic.  He didn't SAY this in so many words, but my guess is that he preferred to leave the 'finished product' with imperfections that it already HAD, rather than fix those and introduce new ones that fans might have less patience for.  I deem that a wise choice on his part, though clearly, what I deem, is irrelevant.  And while you couldn't prove it with MY ears, I'm informed that the pace/pitch issue only applies to the songs the Beatles are rehearsing or performing in the 'theatre' with the 'control room monitors' on them.  Songs elsewhere in the film are at normal speed.",1404432000,4,4008,4.590717299578059

6317667,3,B00J2PQYYK,"The picture looks really good. They've really cleaned it up nicely, it's a bit of an improvement over the first blu-ray release. However, the 5.1 audio is a bit of a let down. This almost completely loses the bass and the bottom end. If you have a subwoofer you'll need to turn it up substantially in order to get a good sound. I sold my first Hard Day's Night Blu-ray in order to purchase this, but I bet that first one is going to go way up in price as the audio was light years better than this.

This set comes with a huge book and in it they talk about the audio. They boast about how they got the original tapes and added the audio from there. Yet in the same breath they almost apologize as they claim (as they always do when it comes to the Fab Four) they wanted to stay true to the original soundtrack. Oh you mean the soundtrack that was so full of limitations because it was mastered at the beginning of 1964? It's been fifty years now, and they still refuse to make the Beatles sound as good as they can.

The bonus features are hours and hours long, I still haven't gotten through all of them. It helps that the featurettes are different than the first blu-ray. I made a mistake selling my old one, I should have kept that and bought this one and had them both in my collection.",1404259200,10,1291,4.180722891566265

6317691,5,B00J2PQYYK,"The Beatles' first - and best - movie has had a checkered history on home video.

Those releases were based on the 1982 Universal Pictures re-release, with a Dolby Stereo soundtrack.

In 2002, Beatles ""expert"" Martin Lewis released a new version on VHS/DVD, through Miramax, and preceded to ruin it, with a muddy soundtrack and washed-out picture. I paid big bucks for an out-of-print copy of the MPI DVD, and always watched AHDN that way. Until now.

The Criterion Collection - a collector's film label - who had released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-short-lived-LaserDisc-version/dp/B001EYF58S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a short-lived LaserDisc version</a>&nbsp;of AHDN in the early '90s - has now reissued the film, just in time for its 50th Anniversary, in both a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/single-disc-DVD-edition/dp/B00J2PQYYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">single-disc DVD edition</a>, and this three-disc set (two DVDs and one Blu-ray disc, both with the same content).  The picture is crystal-clear, and the sound quality - stereo, 5.1, and mono - is superb. Some of the movie song mixes are noticeably different, particularly ""And I Love Her,"" which appears for the first time in a complete true-stereo version with a single-tracked Paul McCartney vocal. The stereo album version is double-tracked, as is the U.K. mono version; original U.S. releases have the single-tracked mono version and the double-tracked stereo version.

The collection includes a nice collector's book with an appreciative essay by Howard Hampton (though I did not appreciate his cheap shot at The Monkees), and a lengthy 1977 interview with director Dick Lester. Most, but not all, of the bonus features from the previous reissues are included in this new version, including Lester's 1959 Oscar-nominated short, THE RUNNING, JUMPING, AND STANDING STILL FILM, which appeared on the MPI DVD; THINGS THEY SAID TODAY, a 2002 documentary that was on the Miramax release (the supplemental material on the second disc of the Miramax release, GIVE ME EVERYTHING!, was not included);&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Making-of-A-Hard-Day-s-Night/dp/6305073694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Making of A Hard Day's Night</a>, a 1994 documentary with Phil Collins; and several new documentaries - one about Lester's style and influence, another one featuring The Beatles in their own words (set to archival footage), some of which also appeared as ""Fab Four On Film,"" the original unreleased B-side to the 1982 single ""The Beatles' Movie Medley"" (Capitol B-5100, replaced on the commercial release by the mono mix of ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You"" [Capitol B-5107 and Parlophone R 6055]), and new 2014 interviews with Lester and Mark Lewisohn. There is also a commentary track with members of the film crew, assembled by Martin Lewis in 2002.

Initially, I was disappointed that the ""I'll Cry Instead"" prologue from the MPI DVD was not included, but then I read online that Universal Pictures added that prologue to the 1982 Dolby Stereo theatrical re-release without the consent of Dick Lester, producer Walter Shenson, or The Beatles themselves. Lester - who rejected ""I'll Cry Instead"" as a song selection for the original film - insisted that the prologue be deleted from all future video releases.

Interestingly, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the only Beatle film not owned by Apple Corps. Bruce and Martha Karsh - the managers of Walter Shenson's estate - own the film, and licensed the rights to Janus Films, who will distribute the film in limited theatrical re-release; Criterion Collection has the home-video rights. On July 5, 2014, I saw the theatrical version of the film at the West End Cinema in Washington, D.C. It was fantastic.

6317695,4,B00J2PQYYK,"To be completely honest, this is the best release of the movie yet. Great picture, several audio choices, & all previous bonus features from the past DVD releases, as it says, included on the discs. 2DVDs, hey there's a lot of bonus features from over the years, & 1 Blu-Ray.

Video quality: 10/10. The Blu-Ray brings the BEST in crystal clear picture to an almost 50 year old film from the mid 60s. Little grain was left, though it's only if you're actively looking for it, looking at some of the backgrounds, or just focusing on some areas throughout. It's great.

Audio: 7.5/10. The quality is crystal clear. Everything's been evened out by a lot & nothing's too loud, or soft, unless it's the crowd at the end.
Now, the elephant in the room, the songs. This has been a problem since the movie came out in 1964. Because of the way it was shot, then converted in post, the film was slowed down &, unfortunately, the audio was as well, since those parts of the film were filmed at 25 fps, rather than the traditional 24, which distorts the sound of the vocals & instruments to a point where it doesn't even sound like the fab four's vocals. This problem persists even in the new 5.1 track. What I was expecting, was the original pitch to be kept in the songs, since in editing equipment, you can preserve the original pitch of a person's voice, while also slowing it down, or speeding it up. Want an example? You can easily do this in iMovie, when editing audio. Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself.
Anyways, I new that since the movie was shot that way, I expected that to be done. It was, for half of the songs used.
What I mean, is that any song that just serves as sound over picture, with no need for accurate lip-syncing, sounds great. Examples: A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, I Wanna Be Your Man, Don't Bother Me, Can't Buy Me Love, & She Loves You (the 1st time it's used).
Other songs, If I fell, And I Love Her, I'm Happy Just To Dance With You, Tell Me Why, She Loves You (the 2nd time it's played), & if there are any other songs used in the medley.
In conjunction with audio tricks, there are also video editing tricks to trim down on the video-syncing issues that persist with the video at hand. There are several YouTubers that have done this on YouTube already. Look the songs up that don't sound decent that I've listed on there, if you want to see this yourself.
Due to how Richard Lester wants the speed of the film to stay as it is, I was expecting the audio tricks that I've listed to be done to the audio to help out in the restoration & make this release one to definitely own. However, if you've been waiting for that to come in this release, it's not to be found here. It really frustrates me that no one thought to preserve the pitch of the songs in audio mixing, is why I bring it up so much.
So, in conclusion. REALLY good picture quality. The description isn't lying. Decent audio quality, but the songs leave something to be desired in terms of pitch. Take your pick as whether, or not to buy it. It's still a great release.",1403740800,14,3078,4.323529411764706

6317697,5,B00J2PQYYK,"Compared to all of the other releases of this film that are out there, this one is absolutely stunning!
If there is such a thing as High Def black & white, this is it!
And, no longer does the audio sound like it's coming through a tin can.

Criterion did it right!  The audio is from the original master film.
The music is done perfectly.  You have the choice of mono, stereo, and a 5.1 mix done by Giles Martin.

The blu-ray was officially approved by Richard Lester himself!  I'm watching it (again) as I'm writing this.  It's stunning, and will in all likelihood be THE top standard for this film for years to come.

I remember a number of years back that there was a DVD release with 5.1 sound. That still had the tinny audio and when the 5.1 came on, it seemed twice as loud as the rest of the movie.  It was a disappointment.

THIS, however, is perfect!  Not only is the picture amazingly crisp, but when set to 5.1, Giles made sure that the volume of the songs matched the volume of the dialogue.. The result is amazing! Please do not buy another version of the blu-ray that is being sold.  This was *just* released on June 24th, 2014, and all of the latest technology (4k digital technology) is used to bring this film to new heights!

I pre-ordered this back in April.  It arrived at my door the morning of its release! It also includes a 2 DVD set that I'll use if I'm ever over at someone's place who doesn't have a blu-ray player, those DVDs are enhanced, as well.

There are lots of extras, including the video of ""The Making of a Hard Day's Night"", a new Mark Lewisohn interview, recollections of those involved, A film about Richard Lester's work, ""In their own Voices"" which have some Beatle audio and picture highlights during that time,  trailers for the movie, and commentary from those who worked on the production of the film. Also, it includes a very thick book which has color photos of the film shoot.

There is more, but I haven't gotten through it all yet!  There are hours of video here.. and it's all great!

So, the old,shadowy look of the film is gone, though it maintains the timeless black and white perfectly, improved audio so that every word they speak is understood, and the remixes of music by Giles Martin, which only makes the songs sound better.  This is by far the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's the version I'll always come back to.

This release is a triumph!  I really can't think of how this release could be better, unless they added Paul and Ringo in a commentary.  This is a collection which captures them at the perfect part of the Beatlemania years.  As a fanatic (still), this is a great surprise!  This company should be in charge of all restorations.

Just waiting for ""Let it Be"" and all of their videos to be released..hint hint, Criterion!  This really is fantastic!",1403654400,60,2836,4.437137330754352

6317699,5,B00J2PQYYK,"Not since I sat in a movie theater surrounded by screaming fans in the summer of 1964 have I seen this movie come alive like this.

A Hard Day's Night is 50 years old and it is as fresh, as funny and as relevant as it was way back when. Having just watched Criterion's beautiful Blu-Ray transfer and listened to some of the most memorable songs of the era re-mastered in stunning DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound, I felt myself transported to an earlier time. A time bubbling with an energy that was about to explode into what we now consider to be The Sixties, because that decade really begins here, with this band and this film.

To those too young to remember the band or the decade, A Hard Days Night will introduce both to you. The film is part cinema-verite, part verbal improvisation and part funny visual puns. American director Richard Lester absorbed the anarchic comedy of the Marx Brothers while growing up and it is to them that the Beatles are usually compared. They show a real flair for comedy with Ringo usually given the lion's share of the accolades. A Hard Day's Night (a Ringoism used to describe a particularly grueling gig) is mostly A Day in the Life of the most famous band on the planet. Traveling from city to city, fleeing from hundreds of screaming girls, enduring inane interview sessions, dancing at parties, television appearances, live concerts and ""parading"" are all contained within the confines of 90 brilliantly creative minutes of film.

Criterion's remastering is superb: the film has never looked as good as it does here in a beautiful 4K digital restoration. The music sounds fantastic, almost as if it were newly recorded using the latest digital technology. I cannot imagine a stronger argument for re-mastering the entire Beatles catalog than listening to how exciting and alive they sound in high resolution audio. The 3-disc set also contains a DVD version of the movie, DVD extras including a making-of film, several documentaries, interviews, Richard Lester's short film that won him the job and more.

The Beatles were the antidote for the post-war years in England and the complacent 1950s in America. They gave so much joy and superb music to the world and this film is as good a monument to their achievement as any I can think of. If you love this movie you owe it to yourself to see it in this pristine re-mastered version. If you haven't a clue as to what the Beatles once meant to a generation, this is where to begin discovering the answers. A Hard Day's Night is a modern icon and it has never looked and sounded so wonderfully alive.",1403568000,17,2580,4.676211453744493

I want AHDN on blue-ray. I want improved picture, sound and some Beatle interviews and a some outakes. Why am I forced to buy features I don't want.

I don't want:
1) 4 other movies that have nothing to do with Beatles
2) 2 extra DVD's with junk on it I don't want.

I want:
1) DVD Blue-ray",1403568000,13,326,3.909090909090909
6317731,5,B00J2PQYYK,"To tell you the truth, if this was an unknown, unimportant band from the 60's, we would NOT be discussing this film.
However, it is The Beatles and Criterion's treatment of their film (that at the time was seen as just a minor effort to promote their album) shows us the most perfect time capsule of the 60's.

There is very little plot as the style is purely cinma vrit. The band joins Paul's grandfather as they try to get to Liverpool for their concert. Along the way, they bump into funny characters and silly situations. It's all very innocent - light years away from the lurid coverage we would see today in similar projects (reality shows?) centered around today's bands - and inconsequential. But to be honest, the only thing that makes this film mandatory viewing are the band's YOUTH, CHARM and HUMOR... and their AWESOME music.

Fifty years later, the biggest band ever is still as relevant as ever... and their timeless songs (and energy) still amaze. That's one of the reasons why we never get tired of The Beatles and we are always trying to get more from them. In a way, we fans feel like they are Picassos who only painted seven or eight paintings: WE STILL WANT MORE!!

So Criterion's treatment is definitely a dream come true. A tour de force for fans:
-DIRECTOR-APPROVED DUAL-FORMAT BLU-RAY AND DVD SPECIAL EDITION FEATURES
-New 4K digital film restoration, approved by director Richard Lester, with two audio optionsa monaural soundtrack and a new 5.1 surround soundtrack made by Apple Recordspresented in uncompressed monaural and DTS-HD Master Audio on the Blu-ray
-Audio commentary featuring various members of the films cast and crew
In Their Own Voices, a new piece combining interviews with the Beatles from 1964 with behind-the-scenes footage and photos
-You Cant Do That: The Making of A Hard Days Night, a 1994 documentary program by producer Walter Shenson
-Things They Said Today, a 2002 documentary about the film featuring Lester, music producer George Martin, writer Alun Owen, cinematographer Gilbert Taylor, and others
-New piece about Lesters early work, featuring a new audio interview with the director
-The Running Jumping and Standing Still Film (1959), Lesters Oscar-nominated short featuring Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan
-Anatomy of a Style, a new piece on Lesters approach to editing
-New interview with Mark Lewisohn, author of Tune In: The Beatles: All These YearsVolume One
-Deleted scene
-Trailers
-One Blu-ray and two DVDs, with all content available in both formats
-PLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by critic Howard Hampton

For us, Beatles fans, this edition will certainly provide hours and hours of MORE Beatles.
That's an offer we cannot refuse.

RECOMMENDED!!!",1403568000,13,2722,5.04
6317732,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I received this today from Criterion via USPS and I have to say the packaging is great and there is a lot of information contained here. I didn't watch any of the extra items yet, I just wanted to see the picture and the 5.1 surround.

I very much understand listening to the Beatles in remastered mono, I own a set and there are times you want to hear mono and other times you want to hear remastered stereo and I own both sets.

I really wanted to hear the 5.1 and I wasn't disappointed, it really sounds great. No one put too much emphasis on the rear speakers, just enough to think they are there but the clarity was wonderful.

Those of you waiting, jump in, you won't be disappointed. I will say more after I listen to all the extras....ENJOY",1403568000,11,748,4.253521126760563

6317734,5,B00J2PQYYK,"First of all, you have to give it 5 stars.  If Criterion is doing it, it's a no brainer.  Therefore, with all the posts about the audio pitch, this is what we should be asking.

Most computers can adjust speed and pitch. My biggest thrill will be if the remix is stereo versions of the mono mixes. Single tracked And I Love Her and Tell Me Why. Corrected harmonica in I Should Have Known Better, and the corrected anthology 5.1 mix removing the McCartney vocal crack at the end of If I Fell. And the ultimate, a stereo mix of the 2:05 version of I'll Cry Instead. THAT MY FRIENDS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE HOPING FOR!!!!!!!!!!

6317768,5,B00J2PQYYK,"I usually don't write a review until I see the finished product, however, as a Beatle fan and motion picture fan, a Blu-Ray Criterion treatment of ""A Hard Days Night"" should push the limit to what Criterion offers in picture, sound restoration and extras. From the Amazon description, the extras will include a focus on the Director, Richard Lester, who I consider an underrated filmmaker. The techniques that Lester used in the musical portions of AHDN had a profound influence on filmmaking (good or bad) to this day. Also, since Lester has approved the restoration, I hope that the extras will include updated interviews and unearthed outtakes from Lester's personal archive.

For those unfamiliar with Criterion, their film restoration process is unmatched. It would be great if Criterion would restore 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather I and II and Apocalypse Now - and lest we forget, ""Let It Be"".",1395878400,41,906,5.04
