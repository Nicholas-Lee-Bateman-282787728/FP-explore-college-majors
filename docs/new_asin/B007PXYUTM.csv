8520790,5,B007PXYUTM,The rage is really a great movie it is action packed from beginning to end. The car chase scene on the mountain road with the semi truck is awesome. IT'S got Gary Busey playing a nut in which he's good at doing. If you like fun action packed movies that are shot well then you will like this movie.,1395100800,2,298,4.067796610169491
8520791,4,B007PXYUTM,"As with any movie, it's mostly a matter of personal preference.  I liked it because there was enough psychotic behavior, violence and action to satisfy me.  Plus I could actually understand the plot.  If you like psychos, violence, and action, I would recommend this movie.",1384992000,,273,5.022222222222222
