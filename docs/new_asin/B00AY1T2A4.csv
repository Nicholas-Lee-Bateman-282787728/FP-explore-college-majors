5526358,5,B00AY1T2A4,"This video opened my eyes to the struggles, joys, challenges and experiences of Christian single adults. The film looked at the issue from several different angles and did a wonderful job of being raw, real and genuine. If we are all part of the church family, then we need to understand what our family members are going thru. So it's very important for everyone to see this film, not just singles.  I highly recommend this film.",1347840000,3,430,4.657894736842105
5526359,5,B00AY1T2A4,This film opened my eyes to see that the single people in my church need my friendship and support regardless if I am married or not.  It is very real and applicable. I love the song of the by the creek... amazing message in those words!,1346112000,,237,4.1521739130434785

5526362,4,B00AY1T2A4,This documentary was spot on about the real issues that single Christians deal with. It resonated a lot of personal struggles that I myself face as a single Christian.,1445040000,,167,4.793103448275862

5526364,5,B00AY1T2A4,I liked this documentary it had a lot of useful information and was very real to the problems many Christians face today. Very helpful and I am glad I watched it because it taught me to keep my eyes on God.,1434931200,,206,4.048780487804878
5526365,5,B00AY1T2A4,as a single Christian woman it's nice to see a movie that deals with the issue of being single in the church and how important it is for the church to accept and embrace us knowing that not everyone is to be married and that the Lord has a purpose for all of us and being single is not a curse,1432684800,,293,3.819672131147541
5526366,4,B00AY1T2A4,"Churches seem to limit their comfort with, support for,  and tolerance of single adults up to the age of maybe 28 to 30 years old.  After that, it can get brutal.  I truly believe that all Church leaders who truly have a heart to meet the needs of the body of Christ should watch this.  I believe this movie is good because it actually acknowledges and gives voice to the struggle of adult Christian singleness.  The elephant in the room is finally addressed.  Ignoring it breeds shame, so I deeply thank the producers of this movie for making this!  I also believe it is just as, if not more important for married folks in the church to see this so that their eyes can be open and to gain more sensitivity, compassion, wisdom, and emotional intelligence about the needs and vulnerabilities of single adult Christians.  Being single adult can be a brutally lonely experience at times, but it is truly unfortunate when that loneliness and isolation remains if not worsens within church life.  Like one of the commentators in the doc mentioned, adult singleness in the church is on the rise and the Church needs to get ready to empower, love, and welcome them with open arms and to help usher and support them into their God given purpose with the family and body of Christ.  It's time to do better Church!",1432166400,5,1304,4.581896551724138
5526367,5,B00AY1T2A4,"This video does a great job of accurately representing the sentiments of single whole, fulfilled Christians adults in traditional church.  I think all church pastors and leadership should do this video.",1431129600,,202,5.516129032258065

5526369,2,B00AY1T2A4,"Unrealistic as usual,  all good looking 30 somethings most whom seem to be musically talented or authors or otherwise talented,  as a never married 55 year old Christian woman I would have loved to see some cases like myself. It's a whole different story when there's still some time left and you haven't moved beyond child bearing years,  but that's a story that no one including believers really wants to dwell on much.  Make a real documentary and show some 50+ average looking overweight singles who aren't especially talented who trusted God to find a mate and it didn't happen.  There is also a big difference between single parenthood , widows and widower, divorced, and never married no children.  My guess is that the producer of the documentary is fairly young.",1427760000,8,771,4.847328244274809

5526373,4,B00AY1T2A4,"I found this video to be very REAL, informative, intelligent. The singles who spoke did a great job explaining what it's like to be single, and I could see they were very in touch with themselves. It really opened my eyes, that single people really do have needs that I need to be aware of.
I just didn't understand why these annoying white lines kept coming up on the screen (as part of the graphics) so 4 stars.",1419379200,,413,4.3076923076923075
5526374,5,B00AY1T2A4,"This represents how society discriminates against single people, and the church is no different. It's no secret the church wants more patrons, and the country wants more taxpayers?",1414368000,,180,5.464285714285714
5526375,1,B00AY1T2A4,Sounded good but it was a documentary of a camera showing about 5 people complaining how hard it is to be single when you belong to a church. Lots of 3rd wheel talk. I'm single and hope I'm not this miserable. Lol. Don't bother unless you want to be completely depressed.,1410998400,,271,4.333333333333333

5526377,5,B00AY1T2A4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this documentary as a Mormon single, but I truly loved it!!! I could fully identify with feeling outside of the 'norm' within the church family. I laughed out loud at some of the funny circumstances described in documentary, and my heart identified with the hurt that singles feel. If you need to feel that you're not alone in your single journey in Christ, I highly recommend this film!!!!!",1398038400,,425,4.68
5526378,4,B00AY1T2A4,"I thought that was awesome! Very honest, heartfelt & real.
It was uplifting & comforting for sure. Good attitudes & approach to living well with Christ & without a spouse. I was inspired to hear these wonderful people saying what isn't heard often enough, and so clearly & beautifully said. Definitely worth watching! I also like the title ""Single Creek"".",1397952000,,355,4.933333333333334

5526380,5,B00AY1T2A4,I've been married for 14 years. I never really considered the challenges of being single. I just assumed it was a lifestyle choice. This film gave me a new appreciation for what it means to live as a single.,1348012800,,207,4.333333333333333
8558961,5,B00AY1T2A4,I enjoyed watching this documentary and the subject is long overdue. I gave it 5 stars because I am a single father myself with a child out of wedlock and 46. The Church should be more inclusive of singles rather than ignoring them. Watching this documentary has made me feel that I can feel comfortable being single and use the time for myself and sharpen the talents and skills God has blessed me with. This film should be viewed in all churches regardless of denomination.,1499904000,,475,4.6
8558962,5,B00AY1T2A4,"Married or single, this documentary is totally worth watching! Very real and touching. Men and women of various ages and life experiences share their stories. There is really something for everyone in this film. Happy or hurting,  this film will inspire you and speak peace to your heart. While you will likely be moved to tears at times, this uplifting film will remind you that you belong to a God who loves you...no matter what. A God who can meet ALL of your needs and is ""more than enough."" Do yourself a favor and watch this film---you will be blessed!",1491523200,,558,4.58
8558963,5,B00AY1T2A4,"A very important issue as it says by their love for one another you will know them .
  If you don't have love you have nothing . So it shouldn't be an issue but it is .

Super movie and put forward the issue clearly and openly . It's understandable to be family focused but sad .",1483315200,,279,3.8596491228070176

8558965,3,B00AY1T2A4,"Mmmm ok I guess. It really misses a lot of points like what about Christian women that like being single? Most of the women in this piece seemed to dislike the fact that they are single. Its not just bad to be single in the church today, its unacceptable to be single and 100% ok with it, what about that?",1466208000,,305,4.1

8558968,5,B00AY1T2A4,"Thank you Chris, for your ministry, i watched your interview in 3abn last night as well as single creek on prime this morning.  I was deeply blessed by your testimony, God is truly amazing and i'm impressed by how much love He has shown you even before you came out into this world. Thanks for sharing that with the world.  I was also blessed on the awareness you bring on divorce & singleness. I watched single creek and finished watching it over a salad this morning with tears in my face, in particular when the young blonde lady is in a cabin and God reveals to her that He, 'adores' her.  I felt as if those words are for me too, and they are.  The beauty is that they are, they are for you and me, for everybody.  Again, Thank you for your work, it was important for me to take these topics out and face them head on, for i been afraid in doing so previously for quite some time.  I will continue to pray for you and your ministry.  May God continue to bless you and will watch your other films on amazon soon.",1459728000,,1016,4.153061224489796
8558969,5,B00AY1T2A4,"As a 30-something Christian single, this 1 hour documentary, ""Single Creek"", was a blessing and encouragement to me when I watched it yesterday! At the beginning of the film there is real talk about the challenges for singles in the church, but there is encouragement about God's heart on the matter toward the end. There is something for absolutely everyone in here. Single Christian sisters, this film was more uplifting than another Hallmark movie. Worth the watch!",1456012800,,468,5.090909090909091
