5312514,5,B009B82ET2,"The Straw Hat Pirates have depended on their beloved ship ""Going Merry"" in many of their battles in sea.  But with the Going Merry needing repairs, thew crew was given a map to visit Water Seven.  And  when they arrive, they learn that the location has its share of powerful people.  Even pirates have been beaten by the local craftsmen, members of the Galley La Company.

But as the crew needs to get cash by exchanging their gold that they have earned in many of their adventures, Luffy, Usopp and Nami go to exchange the treasure for cash and to use it for repairs on the Going Merry.

But all things go wrong for the Straw Hat Pirates when a group known as the Franky Family end up stealing all of the money from the Straw Hat Pirates.

As Usopp goes to get the money back from Franky Family, he is beaten badly.  But when the Straw Hat Pirates come to help their friend, they easily beat the Franky Family but find out that the money is being spent on blackmarket goods by their leader and the money is gone.  Also, to make matters worse, Nico Robin is now missing.

To make things worse, the Galley La Company inspects the Going Merry and find out that it is in the worse shape that it is not fixable.  So, Luffy makes the decision to abandon the Going Merry and find a new ship.  But Usopp, who considers the Going Merry as family, goes against Luffy in his decision, leading to an argument and fight.

Now Usopp has decided to quite the Straw Hat Pirates and if he wins, he will be taking Going Merry and leaving.

As friends are torn apart by this fight between Luffy and Usopp, trouble arises when the Galley La Company suspect the Straw Hat Pirates are responsible for a crime.

Find out how the Straw Hat Pirates will deal with predicament in ""One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three""!

While the DVD release is listed as season four for America, in Japan, ""One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three"" is the beginning of season eight (note: Actually, episode 229 - featured in voyage two, is the first episode that begins season eight).  As the Straw Hat Pirates reach the land of Water Seven where powerful craftsmen, the Galley La Company reside, the crew needs the craftsmen to fix the Going Merry, which has been involved in major wear and tear through the many adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates.

But when misfortune hits the Straw Hat Pirates and pits Luffy vs. Usopp and even Nico Robin has disappeared.  Things between the Straw Hat Pirates have gotten worse, but can they get any better?

VIDEO :

For most television series, because they are created nearly before they are aired on television, unlike film and OVA's, there typically is not much detail involved in a Japanese animated television series. ""ONE PIECE"" is probably one of those rare exceptions in that it has really cool character designs and very detailed artistic backgrounds. Of course, since it is on DVD, you will see some artifacting, combing and edge enhancement but it's not so noticeable unless you are really looking for it.

The anime series is presented in standard 4:3 definition but for a television series, ""ONE PIECE"" sports cool and unique character designs and beautifully painted artistic backgrounds. Definitely one of the better looking anime series that has remained consistent and has not downgraded since it first aired on television. Character designer Kazuya Hisada (who worked on the ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" series) and Noboru Koizumi (who worked on ""Giant Robo"", ""Dragon Ball GT"" and ""Tenchi Universe"") have been very good of capturing ""One Piece"" creator Eiichiro Oda's unique style.

It's important to note that in Japan, the 207th episode was the first ""One Piece"" episode to be broadcasted in HD and in widescreen. So, it will be interesting to see if FUNimation will release these later seasons on Blu-ray in the near future.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, the series is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, English Stereo and Japanese Stereo. Of course, the English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is the better audio choice to listen to, although one who has a receiver that can set their audio to all channels can definitely enjoy the Japanese stereo track as well. But both audio tracks are done very well and I have to admit that ""ONE PIECE"" has one of the most solid English dub tracks for an anime TV series. Very well done on both audio tracks but again, have been very impressed by the voice talent for the series thus far.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's a brand new adventure for the Straw Hat Pirates, but when circumstances  put members at odds with one another, what happens when Usopp and Nico Robin decide they must part ways?

With this latest season of ""One Piece"", things are not well with the Straw Hat Pirates as their beloved ship, the Going Merry is suffering from major damage.  So, they end up going to Water Seven in hopes that the best craftsmen, known as the Galley La Company can repair their ship using the cash that they earned from the treasure they have acquired on past adventures.

But when the money is stolen by the Franky Family and news that the Going Merry is not repairable, this leads to Luffy having to make a major decision and that is to part ways with their ship.

But Usopp, who looks at the Going Merry as part of their family will fight Luffy in order to keep it.  But Luffy is the Captain and unfortunately, their disagreement goes as far as to causing problems between the two.  And as for Nico Robin, she has gone missing and rumors are running rampant that a shooting that injured Iceberg was committed by one of the Straw Hat Pirates, Nico Robin.

Not wanting to hurt the group, Robin wants to distance herself away from her friends.

With ""One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three"", this is probably the most emotional season we have seen internally with the Straw Hat Pirates.  We have seen them fight against many rivals and opponents, but this time, the battle is within and for Usopp, he has seen himself lucky to be alive because he has no special abilities like the other Straw Hat Pirates.  But one thing he did believe in, was fighting as a family and that includes the Going Merry.

For Usopp, the ship is family that he does not want to see destroyed or left behind and when it pits him and Luffy against each other, we can see how it hurts the other Straw Hat Pirates to see one of their own leave.

But as they worry about one former shipmate, now they have to worry about another, especially for themselves as they are all wanted by the people they just befriended.

As for the DVD, you get 12-episodes and picture quality is very good. Especially in Japan, all ""One Piece"" episodes since 2007 have been broadcast in HD and widescreen in Japan, it would be interesting if that means the series would get a Blu-ray release in the United States. But for the DVD, the DVD is colorful, vibrant and looks good on DVD, but it would be interesting to see how this series would look in HD and I'm looking forward to whenever that day comes. Audio is good, dialogue is clear. And for special features, there are two fun audio commentaries featuring the English dub voice talent, textless opening and ending themes plus trailers.

Overall, I enjoy the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates and I'm in it for the long haul. While, we are 241 episodes down and are over 340-episodes behind Japan, it is the longest running action anime series in Japan and the fact that young and old continue to read and watch this series, its a testament of how addictive ""One Piece"" really is.  But what it comes down to is if you want to get started on a long anime series.

Personally, you can join in on any season and still be interested in ""One Piece"".  If you are new and want to jump in, just make sure it's the first voyage of the season, so you get an idea of what's going on.  While it would be good to at least catch the first season to know what the goal of the Straw Hat Pirates is and how they all joined to form their crew (note: you can either look for the anime series or purchase the manga).

Exciting, crazy and one of the awesome anime series that is still airing in Japan and being released in the US, ""One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three"" is recommended!",1358553600,4,8870,4.61440407903123
5312515,4,B009B82ET2,"Four stars?

For constantly putting these dvds out without having to change the cast. Even the interviews are enjoyable. It gives you insight and sometimes let's you see what the actors/actresses think of the show. I have to admit Franky was a little hard to get used to because the japanese version hyper. Not a big deal though if you are a fan it's better than 4kids with Sanji being from boston.

Why did I like it?

As you may have already guessed I have seen the Japanese version. This Arc or chapter in the One Piece story is so crucial because they are tested like never before. There is also a lot of character growth especially in Usopp. And for one I get to see the guy that played Krillin in dragonball z actually play a character who is quite useful to the story. We have already seen Usopp question himself and the Captian for his own Beliefs. He fought Luffy while being already beat up (Twice) and he got pretty far in that fight. In the following dvds look forward to Luffy and company going to the next level to hold their crew together.

Would I recommend this to someone else?

I think fans of One piece we'll love it on some level. Again if you are looking for an exact voice carbon copy to the Japanese I don't think that is fair. If you aren't a fan/haven't seen One piece before I would say start from the beginning.  I can't wait for the next one.",1358380800,,1371,4.294573643410852

5312522,5,B009B82ET2,"Attention Franky fans!  The SUPER strong, SUPER handsome, and SUPER cool cola-powered cyborg in a Speedo makes his debut in this One Piece DVD set.  And yet there is one thing I dread.  The Japanese voice actor for Franky is one of the most SUPER VA's in the business (sounding as much like a Italian-American mobster as a Japanese man possibly could) and I can't help but think that the American VA for Franky is going to pale in comparision (Funimation will probably get the guy who voiced Hercule on Dragon Ball Z).  At any rate, I almost NEVER use the English language track on my One Piece DVD's.

This One Piece set features a whole gaggle of SUPER weird and SUPER fascinating new characters besides Franky (most of whom we'll see much more of in the next several One Piece sets.  Here's a listing:
* Kokoro (who actually appeared in the last episode of the previous set)- A conductor for the Sea Train.  A hideous looking but friendly old woman who constantly grins and constantly drinks.  She is joined by her granddaughter Chimney and their pet rabbit Gombei.
* Iceburg- The mayor of Water 7 and the CEO of the Galley La shipbuilding company.  He has a pet mouse named Tyrannosaurus.
* Kaku- A polite young man who is a chief carpenter at Galley La.  He has a long nose similar to Usopp's except that it's square instead of round and incredible jumping ability.
* Rob Lucci- A silent, stony faced man with a top hat and goatee.  He is a foreman at Galley La.  His pet pigeon Hattori does all his speaking for him
* Paulie- Iceburg's right hand man who has a nasty temper and is always scowling and complaining about women who wear too little clothing (especially Nami).  His fighting style is based on ropes.
* Peeply Lulu- Despite his utterly silly name, this Galley La foreman looks pretty cool (with shades and tattoos on his arms).  His main quirk is a lock of hair that always stands up and (when he tries to push it down) pops up again in the most unexpected places.
* Tilestone- Yet another Galley La foreman, he is a huge, muscular older man with a long gray beard.
* Kalifa- Iceburg's secretary who enjoys accusing men of sexual harassment and sometimes karate kicking them.  Her one quirk that is endearing to me is the way she pushes her eyeglasses up the bridge of her nose when they slip.
* Blueno- The proprietor of a tavern near the Galley La shipyard.  His hair looks like bulls horns.
* Kiwi and Mozu- Twin sisters with huge square afro hairstyles.  They always hang out with Franky and copy all of his moves.
* The Franky Family- Franky's gang, who make their living off of bounty hunting and stealing ships so they can sell their scrap.  Zambai is Franky's right hand man.

But despite all of these SUPER new faces, this is a SUPER troublesome time for the Straw Hat Pirates.  No sooner do the Straw Hats trade all of the gold they got at Skypeia for cash that the Franky Family steals two-thirds of it from Usopp and then kidnaps Usopp to try to get the rest of the cash.  Needless to say, Luffy refuses to hand over the money and raids the Franky House (along with Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper).  The house blows up and Usopp is saved, but Franky has already gone out to spend the money.  Soon after, Luffy accepts what Kaku told Zoro, that their ship (the Going Merry) is worn out beyond repair and they need to look for a new ship.  Usopp refuses to accept this decision as the Going Merry was a gift from Kaya (the heiress who was his friend back home) and declares his resignation from the crew.  However, before he leaves, Usopp challenges Luffy to a duel for ownership of the Going Merry.  It is perhaps Usopp's most SUPER display of courage and fighting spirit yet as he battles Luffy.  Usopp loses the fight, of course, but Luffy lets him have the Going Merry anyway.  The next day, Water 7 is in a SUPER uproar as it has been announced that Iceburg has been shot (not dead) by a masked assailant.  Blame immediately falls on the Straw Hat Pirates.  Franky is also out for revenge against the Straw Hats for attacking his family and wrecking his house and we get our first good look at him as he tracks down Luffy for a fight.  Unfortunately, Franky battles Luffy just outside the entrance to the Galley La headquarters and the Galley La workers join in the fight against Luffy to avenge the attack on Iceburg.  Franky, seeing the Galley La workers as intruders, decide to fight them alongside Luffy and then departs until he can fight Luffy later without interference.  Meanwhile, Robin has been aloof from the Straw Hats ever since a masked man whispered ""CP9"" to her on the street.  Sanji and Chopper track her down and their worst assumptions are realized, that in light of recent events, Robin has also decided to leave the Straw Hat Pirates.

Next:  Franky's past is revealed, along with the true identities and intentions of Iceburg's attackers.",1349136000,12,4886,4.5125

Warning below will contain spoilers about this specific DVD. If you wish to keep the contents of this DVDs adventure a secret then do not read below. If you do not care then have at it.

In this DVD One Piece: Season 4, Voyage 3 Luffy and the gang are entering the beginning of the Water 7 arc. Water 7 is the city of water and home to many famous shipwrights. This DVD contains the story of finding a shipwright for the One Piece crew, meeting the leaders of Water 7, and a division among the Straw Hat pirates. All while these things are happening, the Straw Hats become criminals of Water Seven?! Even more unsettling is the strange behavior of Nico Robin.

5312546,5,B009B82ET2,"Add this to your collection. This series breaks away from the normal ninja, alien anime story lines. This series takes you on a journey wanting to see Luffy get his dream. To become King of the Pirates!",1363824000,,202,4.486486486486487
5312547,5,B009B82ET2,"Water Seven is considered by many fans to be the pinnacle of One Piece thus far, and it's not difficult  to see why.

Containing episodes 230-241, this set contains the first third of the 'Water Seven' arc. The Straw Hats have arrived at Water Seven and are raring to cash in their treasure for some much needed repairs to the Going Merry from the world's best shipwrights, but the damages done to the Merry are far worse then they realize. If that wasn't bad enough, a group of bounty hunters have their eye on the Straw Hats' treasure, and the bounties on their heads...

As the opening to a huge arc, the first disc spends a few episodes with exposition and introducing a ton if new characters, but there's an exceptional amount of plot twists and fights thrown in to keep things interesting. For starters there's the Galley-la shipwrights, who keep One Piece's tradition of insane, wacky and memorable characters. This set also introduces the villainous Franky Family, who do a superb job at tormenting the Straw Hats.

But what sets this arc apart from what's come before it is that the plot twists are both shocking and in many ways heartbreaking (although most of these will be spoiled by the trailer and cover art). As the cover suggests, this set includes One Piece's best fight as fare as outright drama is concerned, and we new sides to the Straw Hats. They may be wacky characters, but here the Straw Hats are more real and fleshed out than ever. And just wait until the cliffhanger on disc two!

My biggest complain would be that, while the artwork is impressive for TV anime for the most part, there are still some annoying off-model moments that pop up, which is especially annoying during some of the more dramatic scenes. The DVD presentation is exactly the same as the previous two voyages, with impressive 24fps 16:9 video, and a choice between 5.1 English and the original Japanese stereo audio with subtitles. Once again, the theme songs are Japanese-only, and it looks like it will stay that way from now on.

Extras include: the textless opening and ending animation, and and English commentary on episodes 233 (ADR director: Mike McFarland, Iceberg: Philip Weber, Chopper: Brina Palencia) and 236 (Mike McFarland, Usopp: Sonny Strait, Luffy: Colleen Clinkenbeard). The commentaries are worth a listen for dub fans, but offer nothing particularly noteworthy.

Even after 230 episodes, One Piece just gets better and better. In Season Four: Voyage Three the series becomes more tear-jerking, dramatic and gripping than ever thanks to its relatable, unforgettable and three-dimensional characters. One Piece continues to be an exceptional shonen anime, and for anyone who's enjoyed the series up to now this set is unmissable.",1362787200,,2747,4.920086393088553
5312548,5,B009B82ET2,"I just don't know how to put this...the Water Seven arc is classic One Piece. If you are a true One Piece fan...you will not be disappointed in it at all. I saw this arc a few years ago with Japanese audio and English subtitles ....maybe I shouldn't have.

I prefer the Japanese voices of Franky and all the rest of Water Seven characters...I think they are more truer to my opinion of what everyone should sound like in the anime than the English ones.

But, I have no choice but to get use to them...since they are set in stone now. But you would have thought with all the time they had to find voice actors...they could have done a better job in match the right voice in my opinion.
