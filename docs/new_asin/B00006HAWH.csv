7968673,5,B00006HAWH,"My grandaughter Emily, who will be 3 tomorrow, is pretty picky about what she likes. She adores this video. This is such a good production, I have enjoyed watching it with her more than a few times. It is so well done; wonderful, whimsical stories about a spunky little girl and her friends. I am pleased to have Emily watch something that is fun and also helps her learn about being courageous. At three Emily worries a bit about monsters and the like. Madeline shows her how to take all of that in stride. Like Calliou, another worthy character she is fond of, there is a great sense of friendship and caring that is not a bad thing in a little girls life.",1343001600,,658,4.357723577235772
7968674,4,B00006HAWH,"I love how the Madeline DVDs are told just like it's being read out of the book - with rhyme and everything!  The songs are cute too, esp the catchy little Madeline theme song.  The animation is of good quality.  My only reservation is that in ""Winter Vacation"", there is an abominable snowman that could be scary for young children.  We picked this up in a 2-DVD pack at our local grocery store of all places - for a baragain price!  I'll sure be looking for more next time I go!",1231113600,,480,4.230769230769231
7968675,3,B00006HAWH,"The movie is really cute, except there is an abdomindable snowman that my two-year old daughter is afraid of.  She covers her eyes when she sees him.  Otherwise she loves the show.",1090454400,4,180,4.59375
