8618457,5,B00FSAN8K6,"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell is one of my favorite books.  I loved this version and think it is a more accurate re-telling of the book.  Cranford, the book, is understated, and this version is understated.  The ""Cranford"" TV series from 2007 is too emotional and sentimental, in my opinion, and I did not care for their combining two other Elizabeth Gaskell novels with Cranford in order to make one story.  I own both DVDs and will be giving the 2007 version to a charity.",1460937600,,474,4.607142857142857
8618458,5,B00FSAN8K6,"Excellent story, acting and good clean entertainment.  Thanks",1452556800,,61,6.625
8618459,5,B00FSAN8K6,"Although do like the more recent version with Judy Dench better, this version brings out some details of the story a little more clearly. It is likeable in its own way, which is more like a stage production.",1432339200,,207,4.473684210526316
8618460,3,B00FSAN8K6,"After watching and purchasing the newest release of Cranford /Return to Cranford (starring Judi Dench), it raised my expectations to impossible heights, I'm afraid.  Nothing can ever top that, I don't believe!  I did give this a three as I love period dramas.  The acting was stiff in this production, but compared to the smut most movie producers call entertainment, this is better.  I would not, however, recommend purchasing.",1411430400,3,428,5.159420289855072
8618461,1,B00FSAN8K6,"We have to agree with the other one star review. Have not read the book, so don't know if either follows it. This version is very dull in comparison with the version with Maggie Smith, Judi Dench(007's ""M""),
and others. This is not intended to be a reflection on the cast of this version, as it may have been
produced under a time constraint compared to the Maggie Smith version. I should mention that we are
pretty much superficial in regard to movies, we only want the movie to be entertaining.",1395705600,3,496,4.461538461538462
8618462,3,B00FSAN8K6,It's not as expected. It was tauted as being the better version  but this version is difficult to stay with .,1394668800,,109,4.190476190476191
8618463,5,B00FSAN8K6,"I enjoyed the earlier series, but this one can stand alone. British humor is so wonderful, and this shows it off beautifully.",1393718400,2,125,4.7272727272727275
8618464,1,B00FSAN8K6,"I had so enjoyed the Judi Dench Cranford that I thought this would be a good choice.

The acting, however, is so overdone that it becomes impossible to watch it!",1389312000,2,161,4.366666666666666
