The other is by So Smart and it is the beginning Spanish. These DVD's he will watch over and over, he can care less about anything else I play....",1374105600,,287,4.052631578947368
8056391,4,B0008KLV6Y,"I like the ability to turn on subtitles, but they only work for that same language.  (Meaning - the English subtitles don't accurately translate when you play it in Spanish.)  Still, I'm glad they didn't try to do all the songs word for word.  The Spanish version of Do, Re, Mi from the sound of music is great specifically because it uses it's own wordplay.  The visuals are cute, although sometimes not super relevant to the song.  They're pretty repetitive for me, but obviously entertaining to the target audience, because my 16 month old loves watching it in either language.  I haven't tried the flashcard or music only functions, so I can't comment on those.",1211328000,,665,4.739130434782608
8056392,5,B0008KLV6Y,My 21 month old son LOVES this DVD.  He asks for it and watches it from beginning to end. He knows many words in both languages because of this.  I wish they had more videos similar to this one.,1198800000,,194,3.948717948717949
8056393,5,B0008KLV6Y,"This DVD has mesmerized my kids, it calms them down, they sit down, pay attention, repeat, and sing along.

My 5 years old that have major speech delays was repeating the words in almost a clear and comprehensible words from the first day, I wish I knew about this much earlier.

It is well made, in a professional quality; I sat with my kids and enjoyed it!

I definitely recommend this; and give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.",1155427200,2,425,4.2875
8056394,5,B0008KLV6Y,"This is a wonderful DVD! My 5 months old boy love it very much. When I turn it on, he will from crying to smiling and dancing.  He like to watch everday. This little money is worth it, can let your hand free for a while.",1142985600,3,220,3.782608695652174
