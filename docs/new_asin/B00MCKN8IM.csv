8671673,5,B00MCKN8IM,"Fabulous collection of 3 of my my favorite films all directed by the incomparable Richard Curtis! Love Actually has become the modern day Christmas Classic & fits right up there belong It's A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street & White Christmas as a must watch holiday tradition.
About Time, if you have not seen it, I won;t say a word...this film is truly magical in every sense of the word. I simply fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it & I can watch this movie over and over again...no hints, just watch.  Bill Nighy is perhaps one of the most enjoyable characters in film in this touching family story...as charming as any movie could be.  And Notting Hill of course is a timeless, fun and so fabulously written love story that deserves watching many times over. Richard curtis is truly a genius.  Please treat yourself and loved ones to this fabulous trifecta of magical enjoyment!",1526256000,,910,4.6397515527950315
