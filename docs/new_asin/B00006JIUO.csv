7970517,1,B00006JIUO,"Very simple, this is a slide show,not a video on the city of Santa Barbara. I ordered avideo, this did not help about the city. There was no mention of the mission at all. Guess what that's a main tourist attraction. This is a terrible dvd don't waste you money!!! I have been here many times, so this slide show does not give agood interpretation of Santa Barbara. Also nothing about the university either gues what that's a tourist destination too.",1398211200,,450,4.567901234567901
7970518,2,B00006JIUO,"This is pretty awful, with really lame and stilted narration (where there is any) and all of it just a collection of businesses that were probably approached to be included.  In other words, you pay your money and you're in -- it's not a collection of places chosen for their merits.

If you want the same info on the cheap just go to their site at sblife dot com and look around.

The music and the narration is from another time -- super dated and unnatural -- and the overall effect is tedious and boring.  Whoever directed and edited even chose to include ""still lifes"" of, for instance, a lamp sitting on a table in a restaurant.  Well that would be okay if it were a lamp of any design merit, but it wasn't, just filler.  The whole thing is like that (for instance at the Santa Barbara Zoo you don't leave with a sense of whether it's a good, interesting design for a zoo.  Instead of overview shots they give you filler closeups of (for instance) a lion's face behind chain link fence that could be absolutely anywhere.

You can easily skip this.

It's truly tedious and not at all worth the money.",1289606400,,1105,4.377450980392157
7970519,1,B00006JIUO,"This is such a horrible rip off, All you see on this video is like 30 seconds of each attraction, with horrible background music, there's not a play all button, it's very annoying to go back to the menu for only a 30 second clip, not to mention it's all advertising, nothing very entertaining about it, SANTA BARBARA is such a beautiful place, the idea of this DVD was good, but delivered poorly, I wanted my family to see the place I live in, I'll have to do a video myself. I want my money back!",1213660800,,497,4.1875
7970520,5,B00006JIUO,"I have lived in Santa Barbara for over 20 years and most people who have visited agree that it is one of the most unique and beautiful places on earth. This DVD is the perfect gift for those who unfortunately cannot be Santa Barbara residents.
