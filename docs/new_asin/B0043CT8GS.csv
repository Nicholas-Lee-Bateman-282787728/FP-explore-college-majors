4255128,5,B0043CT8GS,Great condition.  Learn something each time I look at it.  If you are a artist or  a art lover you will appreciate this DVD,1364947200,,123,4.041666666666667
4255129,5,B0043CT8GS,"My wife, who is an art historian, and I love everything we've seen so far by Januszczak.  The approach here is original, engaging and entertaining, even if we don't agree with the conclusion.  Januszczak is infectious with his unabashed enthusiasm for the subjects.",1363478400,8,265,5.1395348837209305
4255130,5,B0043CT8GS,"like the first reviewer said, it's really good, and a shame it aint longer.  Vincent: The Full Story sounds like a winner.  thanks+",1339632000,,131,4.6521739130434785
4255131,5,B0043CT8GS,"Waldemar Januszczak is my favorite art documentarian; by far the most entertaining, thorough & fascinating I have ever seen. I've seen a fair number of art documentaries, and always pick up a little knowledge from those, but Januszczak totally *revolutionizes* my relationship with that artist (check out his ""Vincent: The Full Story"" to see what I mean). At the same time as this, I picked up his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gauguin-The-Full-Story/dp/B0043CT8GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gauguin: The Full Story</a>, another absolute 5-star film. And his documentary on Lautrec is next on my shopping list, but it looks like I'll need to get it direct from his zczfilms website, because Amazon does not carry it.

This is a shorter film than the other three I mentioned; if I could offer my only criticism of ""Sickert vs. Sargent"", is that its wasn't at least three times longer! But, he certainly covers a lot of ground in this film, and it's a very satisfying 60 minutes. And Januszczak gives us his usual wonderful location shooting, going inside both Sickert's & Sargent's studios.",1300492800,18,1134,5.554913294797688
8414633,5,B0043CT8GS,this was incredible,1518393600,,19,5.666666666666667
8414634,5,B0043CT8GS,"I would have liked this anyway because Sargent is among my favorite artists. I had never made the connection to Sickert which makes a wonderful contrast, a painterly history lesson for the range of social classes and the question, ""What is beauty?"" Januszczak engineers the fight  although both artists deserve to win a championship.",1503187200,,333,5.166666666666667
8414635,5,B0043CT8GS,Yes!,1494892800,,4,4.0
8414636,5,B0043CT8GS,"Anything Waldemar Januszczak does always surprises me with information or insights I didn't know before. And I so enjoy his sense of humour. This DVD film met all my expectations and then some. I wasn't that familiar with Sickert's art work. I am now and although I prefer Sargent's art, I can appreciate Sickert's visual commentary on life as he saw it.",1489968000,2,354,4.725806451612903
8414637,5,B0043CT8GS,Fantastic and absorbing film. Highly recommended!,1431648000,,49,7.333333333333333
8414638,2,B0043CT8GS,"Mr Januszczak has witten a script that sometimes borders the ridicule. A particularly distasteful moment arrives when a young oriental girl with braces tries to emit something that ressembles musical sounds. Mr. J exhibits an obnoxious english accent, and must believe he is
quite a sophisticated english humorist.
The two great paitenrs fell into very bad hands indeeeed.",1409702400,,372,5.431034482758621
8414639,4,B0043CT8GS,"I am a fan of ZCZ films and while this one is very interesting, it falls somewhat short by not fully explaining some things.  Still well worth your time and money.  Let's hope ZCZ films returns to this time period and it's artists",1397260800,6,230,4.325581395348837
8414640,5,B0043CT8GS,"I thought this video was great. I just love what Waldemar does in visiting the locales of the artists and interviews people like he was in any detective show. He always adds info that you can't find easily anywhere else. I did not know that Sargent lived in Whistlers studio. Also in his shows you get to see the actual films of the paintings not just photos in a book ( if you can't see it in person). Author - ""John Singer Sargent : Secrets of Composition and Design""",1388966400,6,469,4.280898876404494
8414641,4,B0043CT8GS,I had never heard of Sickert so it was a new experience and well documented and educational thanks to Waldemar Janusczak.  It arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged.,1383004800,4,175,4.645161290322581
8414642,4,B0043CT8GS,I understand why they compared these two artists but see no real comparison.  Sargent was untouchable.  The film was done well,1371340800,,126,4.9523809523809526
