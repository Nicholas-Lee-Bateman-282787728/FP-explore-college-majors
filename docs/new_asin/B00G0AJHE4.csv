8619872,5,B00G0AJHE4,"I like Bruckner and I like Barenboim so what else could I add? Happy to have purchased this blue ray, worthy of every cent I paid for it. It's pricey though, you really need to like this difficult composer.",1472774400,,206,4.3076923076923075
8619873,4,B00G0AJHE4,"In this concert on June 22, 2010, Daniel Barenboim takes a step up from the less-than-stellar Bruckner Sixth he recorded with the Berlin Philharmonic for Teldec in the 1990s and also from the previous night's drab Bruckner Fifth with the Staatskapelle Berlin, which he brought across town from the Deutsche Oper to the Philharmonie Berlin concert hall to present the last six Bruckner symphonies on consecutive days. Barenboim is more alert, more engaged than the night before, and the musicians respond in like fashion. In addition, Accentus Music's recording engineers produce better results, visually and acoustically, than they did with the Bruckner Fifth. The all-regions Blu-ray image is cutting-edge sharp, the sound full yet transparent. And on this occasion, Barenboim has at his disposal a secret weapon -- Patricia Gerstenberger, a young horn player who at the time of this filming was a member of the Orchestra Academy at the Staatskapelle Berlin and who shines in her solo role.

At a running time from first note to last of 52:42, Barenboim's sleek reading mostly skids along the surface. Of the recordings I'm familiar with, only Heinz R&ouml;gner's is faster, by 30 seconds or so. The first movement (all too typically) is mislabeled ""Maestoso."" Everyone who's played in a marching band knows what maestoso means. Rather than a tempo indication, it's an attitude -- an attitude of proud, dignified nobility. Bruckner's indication, however, is ""Majestoso,"" apparently his own derivation from the Latin ""maiestas,"" which makes the marking sort of a mixture of sovereign majesty and majestic misterioso. Even if much of the ""misterioso"" is missing here, Barenboim's 14:44 will please listeners who don't like to fool around, and key passages are executed quite well. Percussionist and critic-at-large David Hurwitz says only brass players enjoy performing Bruckner. Perhaps no one let him play timpani in the Bruckner Sixth because at rehearsal letter N (9:28 in this recording), Ernst-Wilhelm Hilgers sure looks like he's having a blast rocking 'n' rolling as the timpani explode with the movement's opening rhythm. And in the coda that begins at letter W (13:37) and runs for 60 glorious measures, Gerstenberger guarantees we're not shortchanged a bit. It's a joy to watch a young musician play with such assurance and composure.

Other conductors have brought forth more emotion from the Adagio than Barenboim's 15-minute traversal, but his Scherzo is among the very best. At an overall time of 8:34, not only does Barenboim adhere to Bruckner's instruction of ""nicht schnell"" (not fast), but also turns in an especially affecting Trio that creates a sense of unclouded, almost motionless repose.

The Sixth's Finale does not attempt to storm the cosmic heights as do the Fifth and Eighth, but it contains more substance than it is often allotted. At the beginning, we are -- or should be -- in the Wolf's Glen of Weber's ""Der Freisch&uuml;tz,"" the dark forest where spooks lurk and deals are struck with the Devil. Barenboim doesn't quite take us there. Bruckner's tempo indication is ""Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell"" (moving, but not too fast). A certain degree of tension, of fright, is required that Barenboim's quick pace does not impart. The Sixth's last movement often sounds perfunctory, as it does here, because conductors don't understand the fluctuating shadows and alternating moods and tempos that Bruckner leads us through in the search for light at the end. At almost the same timing as Barenboim's 13:32, Horst Stein and the Vienna Philharmonic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-Symphony-No-6-Weber-Overtures/dp/B0007MR298/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner: Symphony No. 6; Weber: Overtures</a>&nbsp;uncover more of the nuances inherent in the movement's progress. Barenboim is content to simply barrel ahead and play the notes, and what could have been a great performance ends instead as only a very good one.

At a total running time of 58:51 with no special features added, this Blu-ray might seem to provide short measure. For now, Barenboim has the Blu-ray field to himself in the Sixth. Brucknerites will already have their favorite audio recordings. I would think everyone's short list should include Stein's, taped in 1972, and the 1964 recording with Heinz Bongartz leading the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig issued on CD by Berlin Classics in 1996 (and available on mp3 downloads at 99 cents a movement from a Legendary Masterworks box set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legendary-Masterworks-Recordings/dp/B001D0RSEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legendary Masterworks Recordings</a>&nbsp;on Amazon).

Even if Barenboim's Bruckner Sixth doesn't crest the summit, I'm quite glad to have it -- for the Scherzo but primarily because of the opportunity to watch horn soloist Gerstenberger, who is appropriately highlighted throughout. The audience loves her, too. As Barenboim asks various musicians to stand during the applause, she blushes when everyone starts stamping their feet when she's recognized. It's a fitting tribute.",1454198400,3,5836,6.001200480192077
8619874,5,B00G0AJHE4,"Other reviewers have said about everything I can think of to describe this delightful Blue Ray, so rather than try to come up with something new to say, I'll simply state that Bruckner's 6th is probably my favorite of his symphonies.  It is rather ""compact"" compared to most of the others (I have six of them) but still not short on development.  The Staatskapelle has been a favorite for years, and this was in no way disappointing.  I generally find that I prefer Danial Barenboim's conducting to his keyboard work (not to say he isn't one of the titans of the keyboard) and it is impressive to watch his technique on this disc.  He is truly ""one"" with the orchestra, and his conducting a piece of this scope totally without following the score is quite impressive.  I heartily recommend this terrific performance.",1452816000,,816,4.71830985915493
8619875,5,B00G0AJHE4,"Dear Amazon: the article is a reaction to the misleading, or rather incomplete,  comment by Clive Godwin, as he discusses Barenboim's DVD of Bruckner's Sixth. I realize that you could be reluctant to add this article, essentially a condensed analysis, but I felt that a rectification is needed to gain an understanding of this difficult but brilliant. work. The choice to add this to the comments is yours.

Clive S. Godwin.s comment that Bruckner's Sixth is in the Phrygian mode prompts me to make a few or my own comments, Godwin is right to a point, but it is misleading as  nowhere in the work do we encounter the tone of the Phrygian mode as, for example, in the second movement of Brahms Fourth. In Bruckner's Sixth, the Phrygian mode is merely the background to its harmonic structure.
In the Seventeenth Century, Neapolitan composers (A Scarlatti etc.) began to experiment with the Phrygian mode, and they analyzed key chord relationships based on the diminished Second (supertonic) and diminished Sixth which characterizes it. Ever since, music theory talks about Neapolitan inflections or chords whenever such relationships are incorporate by composers in their works.
Bruckner's Sixth is built on such a Neapolitan relationship, B flat and F natural to A major. The work concept is that the momentum of the work is not achieved by means of the classical tonic to dominant tensions but by complex harmonic relationships. Such an approach provides many difficulties for many listeners and presupposes some knowledge of harmony. This is succinctly expressed by John F. Berky (A Bruckner, an Introduction, quoted in the Wikipedia article on Bruckner)) when he writes: ""Bruckner expanded the concept of the symphonic form in ways that have never been witnessed before or since. ... When listening to a Bruckner symphony, one encounters some of the most complex symphonic writing ever created. As scholars  (my emphasis) study Bruckner's scores they continue to revel in the complexity of Bruckner's creative logic.""
His A major symphony superficially looks like the traditional classic symphony, but the tensions of the work is provided, not by the tonic/dominant relationship but complex harmonic sequences based on Neapolitan chord relationships.
Movement One: The symphony opens with a theme that seems to be based on A major but has incorporated the two tones B flat and F natural, Neapolitan diminished Second and Sixth. These two, B flat and F natural, challenge the birthright of A major throughout the symphony and thus create its momentum, which essentially is based on ""harmonic conflict"". Moreover, the typical Brucknerian opening background, here a rhythmic figure, is set, not on the tonic, but the third tone of the A major triad, C sharp. Thus, a clear feeling for the tonic does not emerge, as it should't by design, and when the second theme enters in E minor and turns to E major in due course, we never have the sense that this is the dominant. It takes almost 11 minutes into the movement before the tonic is finally established. But after an extended tutti in A major, the harmonies begin to roam again. As we get to the Coda, the music settles into the tonic for a moment but immediately begins to roam again In this coda, one of the greatest passages in all of Bruckner, we traverse the harmonic world as it relates to A major, until about midway through it the authoritative FF entrance of the tympani in D stops the harmonic wanderings. This D possibly could be part of a subdominant chord or sequence, but we have no sense of a subdominant. But it does the trick (""as though it is a subdominant""): the final bars affirm the Tonic.
Second movement. The Adagio is in F major; moreover, the main theme sounds almost like B flat minor at times, so the F major is blended up, too. It appears that we have a victory in the harmonic struggle; F emerged as such. It permits Bruckner to write a movement of incredible tranquility and nobility. But harmonic complexities persist: for example, the second theme is in E major! It is a movement of wonderful harmonic finesses but ends in in F major in the beautiful coda.
Third movement, the Scherzo. For Bruckner, the real challenge, though, posed the Scherzo. Generally, it is this movement that shows the power and energy behind the music, but he has to proceed carefully here lest the home key of the whole symphony (A  major) became too assertive. He sets the movement in A minor but succeeds in blending it up by keeping the basses on the third tone of the harmonies; the first chord in the root position is not until the very last bar!
The Fourth Movement has to settle the issue. The key signature is A minor again, but the first theme circles around F natural (flat sixth) so that the A minor is not sharply profiled. Then comes the challenge: A major crashes in unexpectedly and tries to assert itself in a loud passage. But immediately it is checked by a powerful theme in the brass (bar 37) on F and B flat. And so the ""struggle"" continues, with A major again and again attempting to establish itself, and F and B flat denying it.  As the movement evolves, the feeling for A major as the tonic increases gradually, and the checks of F natural and B flat more and more appear to be simply challenges -- they essentially lose their right to this symphony, The last such challenge occurs right before the end, from X to Y  in the score (bars 371-384),  where B flat minor makes a brutal gesture in the basses; now it sounds like merely an unwelcome  intruder. And so quickly, A major triumphs and brings the symphony to its end, with the main theme of the first movement but purged of F and B flat, and the rhythm on the tonic, lending assurance.
The conductor Georg Tintner, who spent his life in the service of Bruckner's music, felt the abrupt ending to be a minor weakness of the symphony. I must disagree, but it definitely does not end as any other symphony, which generally confirms emphatically the tonic in the recapitulations of its sonata movements. The ending is abrupt, and in some sense sort of ""inconclusive.""
Bruckner called his Sixth the Keckste, the most cheeky or daring. And we should mention that Beethoven, in the Finale of his Eighth Symphony in F major uses the Neapolitan diminished Sixth (C sharp) effectively to create added momentum to a symphony that has no really slow movement. I always wonder whether Beethoven's Eighth inspired Bruckner. Also, Beethoven kept insisting that the Eighth is better work than the more popular Seventh. Maybe these composers knew what they were talking about.",1429228800,2,6635,4.798775153105861

8619879,5,B00G0AJHE4,"Not so very long ago, recordings of Bruckner's symphonies were few and far between. Nowadays, for almost all of his 11 symphonies (nine numbered ones plus his F-minor Study Symphony and the one called ""Die Nullte"") and there are so many CDs from which to choose that it frequently comes down to selecting one based on ones favorite orchestra or conductor. Even the less rarely performed No. 6 has issued in at least 30 different interpetations. With DVDs, however, the selection is much smaller, which paradoxically can make one's choice easier. Daniel Barenboim is currently working on a complete cycle of all of the Bruckner symphonies. Now we have the Sixth, which was composed between 1879 and 1881. Since this symphony is reputedly the only one that Bruckner never revised, why does the back cover of the album state ""original version""? This strikes me as being pointless and possibly misleading.
This Symphony has long been one of my favorites; it seems to me to have four strong movements, and each has appealing melodies, which I cannot honestly say about some of the others. In this symphony Bruckner made use of the Phrygian scale (exemplified by playing all white notes on a piano keyboard between E and E') rather than the traditional major or minor scales, which may help to explain what may otherwise appear to be unusual note sequences. Compared with some conductors, Barenboim's directorship is relatively low-key and relaxed, yet he draws a powerful performance from the Berlin Staatskapelle. The orchestra delivers a splendid rendition, and both sound and video are crystal clear. I am delighted to be able to add it to my collection of DVDs of late-romantic symphonies.

8619880,5,B00G0AJHE4,"Having dearly loved Bruckners music for decades, I must confess that his sixth symphony with its many quirky and seemingly unrelated motifs, strange harmonies and frequent lack of linear development has not been among my favorites. My friend Clive Goodwin (see his excellent review of the same disk) recently directed my attention to Bruckners use of the Phrygian scale and thus opened my ears for a new appreciation of the work.

We are now fortunate to have Daniel Barenboims June 2010 live recording of the Sixth at the Berlin Philharmonie with his Staatskapelle Berlin in exemplary video and audio (once again: bravo Accentus!). Needless to say, the Staatskapelle musicians are consistently superb, in solo and group passages as well as in the overwhelming ensemble in the tutti sections. Barenboim  he conducts without a score and never ceases to amaze me  is sensitive to every nuance, every mood change, and he brings out a cohesive structure in the entire symphony I found missing or obscured in other interpretations. He displays the ideal balance between gravitas and occasional bold jauntiness in the first movement, highlights the melancholic beauty of the Adagio, the festive hunting aura of the Scherzo, and pulls all the stops in a highly dramatic, powerful finale that will leave you speechless. It is difficult to bring off a symphony with predominantly slow movements (Maestoso  Adagio  Nicht schnell  Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell), but Barenboim, with flexible tempi and swift interplay between instrumental groups, does it irresistibly. This reading will keep you spellbound from beginning to end. It certainly has brought Bruckners Sixth much closer to my heart. Now I can hardly wait for the release of the remainder of this remarkable Bruckner cycle. Meanwhile: who will give us an equally excellent Third on DVD?",1391817600,7,1837,5.2101694915254235
8619881,5,B00G0AJHE4,"When I was a college student back in the early sixties, and getting into classical music, in the midst of Beethoven, Mahler, etc., I happened across Bruckner's Sixth symphony. I was immediately captivated. I had no idea why! Was it the yearning feeling, the almost mournful chord progressions, the endlessly changing arpeggios, the spine-tingling brassy crescendos? Eventually I got into the rest of Bruckner's works, but none had the same effect on me.

Several months ago, I happened on to a BBC You Tube item, which explained that the sixth symphony was composed using the Phrygian scale, as opposed to major or minor scales. The Phrygian mode is almost the same as the minor scale, except that the first semitone falls between the first and second notes in the octave, as opposed to between second and third in the minor scale. If you're interested, go to a keyboard and play an octave on white notes only, starting with E. This is the Phrygian scale. You can do the same with the minor scale, except start at A. Or go to Wikipedia, which has sound links to these scales.

This slight scale modification is the reason for the ""yearning"" quality of the music and allows it to gradually ascend to the final cadence in the piece to resolve at A major, with the resultant feeling of exultation. Medieval church music, flamenco and klezmer also utilize this mode. If you have heard Barber's String Adagio or Vaughan-Wlliams's Thomas Tallis Variations, you have experienced music written in the Phrygian Scale.

Anyway - to this recording. Barenboim continues onward with his Bruckner cycle, which to my ear, improves with each new release. This is a very rhythmic piece (apart from the beautiful adagio) and Barenboim has just the right pulse. The Staatskapelle Berlin play like angels - I ran out of superlatives watching and listening to them. Like all concerts from this venue with this orchestra and conductor, the picture and sound qualities are beyond reproach. The brass climaxes with the full orchestra in the first movement will engulf you. The audience reaction at the conclusion was even more enthusiastic than in the Bruckner #4 and #5 concert discs that preceded this one. I can't wait for 7,8 & 9!

Not un-importantly, the price for this disc is only ~$20- as opposed to the $30-35 we are usually asked to pay.

This symphony has not enjoyed the same amount of live performances as the other Bruckner symphonies, and I have no idea why. It remains my favorite.(there are many excellent cds of it) By the way, Bruckner uses the Phrygian mode in some of his other works also, but not to nearly the same degree..

You can sample this on You Tube, but for the full splendor of the sound, you need to get this disc. I like this interpretation better than on all the many cds of this piece that I own, and Barenboim deserves tremendous credit for this - conducting without a score, too!

A great performance ( and the only bluray available) of one of my favorite symphonies. Good thing these discs don't wear out.",1391212800,13,3020,4.751908396946565
