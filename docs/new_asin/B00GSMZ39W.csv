8626815,4,B00GSMZ39W,"This movie was good... After watching you realize it's only a few sets, almost as if it could've been a stage play- but the content was so good you barely notice the whole movie takes place either in the club or his apartment. It's truly entertaining... Paula Jai Parker was a riot at certain unexpected moments.  And it was to refreshing to see Steve Erkel in another role, Jaleel White is a good actor.  Enjoyed this movie.",1402185600,,425,4.5064935064935066
8626816,4,B00GSMZ39W,It was different but yet it held my interest. it took reality for the guy that couldn't hold down a relationship to realize he had an issue. Once he learned that he had a problem then he knew what he had to do to resolve it.,1397174400,,224,3.891304347826087

8626818,3,B00GSMZ39W,"The movie had an abundance of quips, jokes and a decent plot to keep your attention. However, it lacked consistency-especially between the featured main characters. For instance, he likes to control his mate, have the woman subservient to his every whim, then departs the relationship all within the span of a year. His current girlfriend, has a great job, but yearns towards acting-he discourages this, yet he left his occupation in marketing to pursue club management.

As a result, she leaves and continues to appear back in his life constantly. Meanwhile, he decides to have casual relations with two other women-both spell trouble. Eventually, he realizes the err of his ways and with the help of a friend enters counseling. He wants his girlfriend back, she leans towards yes, no, then perhaps....lacks a definitive conclusion. Another flaw, too many comedians. Yes, a few were amusing, the remnants were quite dull causing the movie to ""drag on"" at points.

Overall, the movie should have more length (for plot, dealings, conclusion) and less of ""comedy central."" I do not recommend this film for purchase.",1394150400,4,1113,5.1098901098901095
8626819,4,B00GSMZ39W,Loved the storyline. I am a big fan of Mr. Wesley Jonathan. The other actors and actresses made this a fun and entertaining movie.,1393027200,2,130,4.458333333333333
