7898147,5,6305912548,"This is one of my favorite movies! It has a wonderful cast and great characters! Tyler, the mean big brother, is played by my favorite movie star, James Marsden! He has so much talent! The plot of the movie is good and there are many funny jokes! It's a great family film! Its even better when you watch it and then watch 27 Dresses! Then you see how James has gone up in his acting career! I say every family should watch this movie! It's a classic!",1213660800,,450,4.183908045977011
