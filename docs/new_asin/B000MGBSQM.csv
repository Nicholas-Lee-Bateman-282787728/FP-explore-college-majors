2734137,2,B000MGBSQM,"Great series, landmark pilot film, terrific 35mm prints.  BUT BUT BUT why in the world did they use time-compressed prints of the weekly episodes (the pilot feature is not time-compressed).  Each episode was originally 51 minutes long and they have been time-compressed to play in 47 minutes.  Consequently, all the voices are very high and the music has been pitched upward.  Obviously there is no hope for this set.  But I hope Shout Factory realizes their error and uses 24fps transfers for the second season shows.

What a crime.  Where's Ironside when we REALLY need him!!",1177545600,27,577,4.947916666666667
2734138,5,B000MGBSQM,"I have just watched a few of these episodes...and I want to alert my fellow DVD buyers that if they are fans of this show....the DVDs are very high quality. This show must have been shot on good film stock as the images are crisp, well saturated and excellent contrast. The guest stars are movie star quality and the stories are interesting..and well acted. Above all...Raymond Burr is a fascinating actor and as far as the small screen is/was concerned he had a commanding presence which is always compelling. I'd put these on a par with the columbo sets ...in story and strength of guest stars. If you are a fan you will not be dissapointed.",1173571200,47,643,4.551724137931035
2734139,5,B000MGBSQM,"Ironside was an outstanding television series for a number of reasons. One reason is that this series about the paralyzed Chief of Detectives of San Francisco began a wave of series with detectives and law enforcement types who dealing with some type of handicap or seeming hindrance (Longstreet, Barnaby Jones, and Cannon). Second, it was one of the first television shows that included a black regular (Don Mitchell) in its politically correct mix of white, black, and female that would often duplicated in years to come.

But one of the most compelling reasons that this show still intrigues and captures the attention of the viewer is the presence of Raymond Burr. Not only did he give Robert Ironside the gravitas, wit, and intelligence that the character required, but he did something that no other television actor had accomplished up to that point, and few have done since, and that is to completely reinvent himself successfully a new character in the public's imagination. The transition really began from motion pictures to television since Burr had been a reliable villain in films in the late 40's to mid 50's. Then, as Perry Mason, Burr transformed himself from a shady, often psychotic character to the smooth, intellectually astute attorney who never lost a case. Then two years after Perry Mason went off the air, Burr transformed himself once again from Mason to Ironside, a hardened, cynical, even bitter detective who has to learn to depend on others for the first time in his life. Andy Griffith and Buddy Ebsen accomplish this feat later by having success as two different characters, Griffith as Andy Taylor and Matlock, and Ebsen as Jed Clampett and Barnaby Jones, but no one on television has reinvented himself as two successful and totally different leading characters as Burr did with Perry Mason and Ironside.

Like all great television shows, Ironside had the strong lead character, great supporting cast (Mitchell, Don Galloway, and two lady detectives who worked at different times during the series - Barbara Anderson and Elizabeth Baur), great guest stars, great writing and great directing. This remarkable series richly deserves its DVD release.",1173052800,43,2182,5.126404494382022
2734140,5,B000MGBSQM,"Hardly any actor so credibly reinvented himself as many times as Raymond Burr. In the late 40's into the mid 50's he often played the villain, usually in westerns, but once he had a minor but crucial role as the villain in Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". Then there were all those years playing unbeatable defense attorney Perry Mason that I figured he'd be typecast forever after that series ended. However, he did such a credible job playing the wheelchair-bound Ironside that the staff at restaurants were surprised when he would show up for reservations walking in on his own two legs. The show had camerawork that was ground-breaking without being annoying, there was a feeling of family and comraderie among the cast that oddly enough reminds me of Joss Whedon's ""Angel"" in that regard, it had much better plots than the other ensemble cop shows of that era, and it even had lots of counter-culture material that worked out pretty well without being cheesy or preachy considering the age of its main star, Burr, who was 50 when the show premiered.

The premise of the show is that while vacationing in an isolated farmhouse, Robert Ironside is shot by an unseen assailant. The result of this wound is that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Accustomed to being Chief of Detectives, and not wanting to be put out to pasture, he turns to his old friend, the Commissioner of Police, who makes him his Special Consultant so that Ironside can go on working on cases rather than face living the life of a retiree on a disability pension. The supporting cast, and his team in solving crimes during the series, consists of rookie detective Ed Brown, policewoman Eve Whitfield, and somewhat reformed juvenile delinquent Mark Sanger. Up to this time, police detective shows had consisted of able-bodied young white men dressed in suits complete with hats, no matter what the occasion. This was one of the first TV shows of that genre - maybe the very first - to mix things up with an interracial cast, a policewoman who was an integral part of the team, a handicapped leader, and a member of ""the establishment"" in Ed Brown thrown in for good measure.

If this formula sounds a lot like Mod Squad, that's because it is, except Mod Squad came out the following year on the coattails of Ironside's initial success. Ironside had its share of guest stars that made it big in later years. In this first season keep  a lookout for a young Harrison Ford in ""The Past is Prologue"", for Ed Asner in ""The Fourteenth Runner"", and Susan St. James in ""Girl in the Night"".",1172102400,10,2551,4.689732142857143
2734141,5,B000MGBSQM,"After making Erle Stanley Garner's fictional lawyer Perry Mason, a television icon in the 50's and 60's, Raymond Burr returned to series TV as Robert T. Ironside.  As the wheelchair bound detective, Ironside became Burr's second classic TV character.

Much of the setup for the series takes place in pilot, which is included in this DVD set.  Ironside, the San Francisco Police chief of detectives, is shot while vacationing.  Recovering in the hospital, the ultra-tough cop barely flinches when he receives the devastating news that he will never walk again.  Pushing back his fears, the fiercely independent Ironside attempts to deal with the situation head on, taking on his on his own case.

No longer able to remain on the police force, Ironside becomes a special consultant to the department.  With the support of his good friend, the police commissioner (Gene Lyons), Ironside is provided with a staff that includes detective Ed Brown (Don Galloway), policewoman Eva Whitfield (Barbara Anderson) and personal assistant Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell).  With this team in place, Ironside takes to the streets of San Francisco in a wheelchair accessible armored car.  In a fiery climax, Ironside discovers who shot him and why, setting the stage for the TV series to begin.

Intelligent, tough, impatient, and determined never to give up, Chief Robert T. Ironside commands attention, even in a wheelchair.  An ex-Navy officer, Ironside runs a tight ship.  Despite the hard exterior, the `Chief' has a kind and gentle heart, though tough love is often his way.  He has special relationships with each of his staff, particularly his live-in assistant Mark Sanger, a young man at a crossroads, finding his way in life.  The group forms an efficient team, and then becomes like a family.

In the turbulent 60's, so much was happening, and San Francisco was a major cultural hotspot.  Music, drugs, crime, the anti-war movement, racial tension, academic turmoil and the sexual revolution were just a few issues of the day, which makes for some interesting viewing some 40 years later.

Quincy Jones wrote the original musical theme for the pilot, however the more `electronic' TV version, where Ironside is shot after lighting a cigarette, is the one most people will probably remember and recognize, particularly as it was featured in the movie Kill Bill.  Overall, the music in Ironside is kind of cool jazzy, and adds a lot to the final product.

While he is almost universally associated with the character Perry Mason, it is as Ironside that Raymond Burr's power as an actor can truly be appreciated.  Even with the physical limitations and challenges of the role, Burr still commands your attention, in a way that few others could.  His blue eyes could burn like fire, or be full of compassion and warmth.

One of the few crime dramas from the 60's available at this time, Ironside is well worth checking out.  The plotlines are generally not overly complicated, with a myriad of suspects and subplots.  The action tends to be more centered and focused.  The program is sometimes a bit dated, but that is to be expected, and not necessarily a negative.  Who knows, you might find yourself saying `flaming' and craving some canned chili.",1171929600,12,3237,5.003738317757009
2734142,5,B000MGBSQM,"""Ironside"" was one of the best detective shows of the 1960s and remains a classic of its genre. Memorable characters, brilliant acting, well-crafted stories and unforgettable theme music written by the legendary Quincy Jones, ""Ironside"" brought the beloved actor Raymond Burr back to series TV after a nine year Hall of Fame portrayal of the most famous lawyer in TV history: Perry Mason.

""Perry Mason"" ended its run in 1966, but the remarkably robust, vigorous and energetic Burr jumped immediately back into the rigorous demands of series TV in 1967. He starred as former San Francisco Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside in a pilot movie that led to the very successful series, which itself ran for eight seasons.

In the pilot, Burr's character, a tough, demanding and brilliant Detective with a quick wit and often just as quick temper, took his first vacation in 25 years. At a remote cabin while he is talking on the phone, Ironside is shot by a sniper with a grudge wielding a rifle and is left for dead. Somehow, he survives but is permanently disabled - he is paralyzed him from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair.

The series was created by Collier Young. The decision to make Burr disabled was remarkable for the era, as few TV leads were ever depicted as anything but able bodied.

Forced to cope with his disability, Ironside is humbled by his emotions, as well as the outpouring of support he receives from friends and colleagues.

Determined not to be trapped in his wheelchair or give up his career, he volunteers to work within the police department as a ""special department consultant,"" investigating his own attempted murder as his first case.

Ironside drafts two young law enforcement officers, Detective Sgt. Ed Brown, portrayed by Don Galloway, and Officer Eve Whitfield, portrayed by Barbara Anderson.

He also hired delinquent-turned-bodyguard Mark Sanger, portrayed by Don Mitchell, as his ""legs."" Sanger, an African-American with a chip on his shoulder and a hatred for the police, eventually went to law school and became an attorney.

Ironside's consultant status was granted by Commissioner Dennis Randall, portrayed by Gene Lyons, who also frequently clashed with his long-time friend over Ironside's investigative methods and his willingness to break the rules to achieve true justice.

Ironside was allowed to retain a floor (for living and office space) at police headquarters and made use of a specially modified and equipped police van to accommodate his wheelchair. The kitchen cupboards were filled with one provision: cans and cans of chili con carne, which Ironside called the ""pefect food.""

Once his staff was assembled, Ironside ""rolled"" into his investigations, traveling in the specially equipped van that Mark had converted to accommodate the Chief's special needs.

During the series, the show took an unflinching look at the social issues of the 60s and 70s, which included racial strife, the war in Vietnam, and drug use.

As the stories evolved, the barely civil relationship between Ironside and Mark deepened to a close friendship, and eventually the three ""staff"" members became Ironside's true family.

Whitfield, who was hugely popular, left the series in 1971. Elizabeth Baur joined the cast as Officer Fran Belding and remained until the series ended in 1975, but never found the fan base that Whitfield had.

This boxed set includes all of the first season episodes including: The Pilot; Message from Beyond; The Leaf in the Forest; Dead Man's Tale; Eat, Drink and Be Buried; The Taker; An Inside Job; Tagged for Murder; Let My Brother Go; Light at the End of the Journey; The Monster of Comus Towers; The Man Who Believed; A Very Cool Hot Car; The Past Is Prologue; Girl in the Night; The Fourtenth Runner; Force of Arms; Memory of an Ice Cream Stick; To Kill a Cop; The Lonely Hostage; The Challenge; All in a Day's Work; Something for Nothing; Barbara Who?; Perfect Crime; Officer Bobby; Trip to Hashbury; Due Process of the Law; and Return of the Hero.

A few of the actors who guest starred in the series over the years included Harrison Ford, Joan Van Ark, Bill Bixby, Kent McCord, John Rubinstein, Jack Lord, Norman Fell, Gavin MacLeod, Gary Collins, William Shatner and Martin Sheen. Even Quincy Jones had a guest starring stint.

Raymond Burr was a truly unique man. He was a voracious reader with an almost photographic memory. Although he did not attend college, he had an interest in almost everything and studied on his own gaining an impressive bank of knowledge that rivaled university graduates with advanced degrees. In addition to his active mind and endless energy (he slept very little) he also cultivated orchids and even developed a variety he called ""Della,"" named and inspired by his beloved former Perry Mason co-star Barbara Hale, who played his secretary Della Street.

""Ironside"" is a release long overdue for fans of great detective dramas and Raymond Burr. Let us hope the remaining seasons of this outstanding series are released quickly!",1171324800,105,5041,5.017964071856287
2734143,5,B000MGBSQM,"Leave it to Raymond Burr, just when you thought he was typecast as the best defense lawyer in the world, he starts all over again.  Never in watching this show did I ever think what is Perry Mason doing on the police force.  He created a new character that was enjoyable to watch.  This was a thinking man's mystery where crimes are solved most often with brain power.  That is not to say that it lacks action.  Once again there is a good ensemble cast to fill out the show.  This is fun to watch.  You will know you are in for something different when you hear the first notes of Quincy Jones's theme.",1170979200,13,602,4.228070175438597

For 16-17 years, Raymond Burr ruled the network airways.  Everything he did on TV was ratings gold.  Even when he came back in the 80's and did the Perry Mason movies, they were ratings gold.

2734280,1,B000MGBSQM,"Raymond Burr was one of our finest actors.  He could have kept our attention for an hour just reading addresses from the phone book.  As nine years on Perry Mason attest to, audiences loved him in the part.  ""Ironside"" brings him back as detective confined to a wheel chair.  Essentially, an arm-chair detective, no doubt inspired by another fictional detective, Nero Wolfe.  As such, ""Ironside"" suffers from the same problems as its predecessor, particularly that Ironside must delegate the legwork to others.  Ironside is far less likable than Perry Mason.  He's so rude to his staff, one wonders why they would put up with the abuse?  William Conrad, who played a similar role as ""Canon"" managed to balance the hard boiled detective with a man who also had a heart.  Ironside seems to have a perpetual chip on his shoulder, which makes him less likable.  The show also suffers from the ""too many cooks"" syndrome, there are four principals in the lead, Ironside, with a female and male police assistant and a caretaker, all in fairly stereotypical roles.  The female officer is seen doing all of the cooking and cleaning around the office, for example.  The shows seems remarkably similar to ""The Streets of San Francisco,"" which offered far better chemistry between the two leads, Karl Malden and Michael Douglas.  In contrast, Ironside has too many people standing around in scenes, waiting to get their share of lines in.  This also makes for clumsy dialogue, where lines are passed from player to player to give them something to say.  That said, the character of Perry Mason was always more interesting when he played detective, so on that score, we get to see Burr at his best.",1212537600,7,1685,4.8426573426573425

If you are a fan of this time 60's tv, this is a must have. Thank you ""Shout Factory"" for this release. Burr is especialy grouchy in the pilot,and you have never heard ""Tiny Tim"" sing higher.

2734283,5,B000MGBSQM,Ironside had always been one of my favorite detective series when growing up. I found the shows still as interesting and exciting as when I last saw them on regular TV about 15 years ago. The set is designed nice and the disk cases are well constructed. The only real drawback to this set is the commercial type introduction for the company that produced the set that shows up every time the disk loads. The company name escapes me at the moment but it is kind of annoying to have to see that every time you load the disk. I still give it a 5 star because the episodes are so good and the set is top quality. I'm looking forward to collecting all the seasons and hope they will be produced soon. Ironside was a full 8 seasons and officer Eve Whitfield was in the first 4 seasons followed by Officer Fran Belding who served with the chief for the final 4 seasons.,1202601600,2,862,4.262195121951219
2734294,4,B000MGBSQM,"After viewing the Perry Mason series, we craved more Raymond Burr. Ironside, though an entirely different character, does not disappoint. This is an awesome crime series, and Ironside is one of the most endearing characters in crime show history. This series is mind stimulating, yet filled with humor, and appropriate for children and adults alike. I would definitely recommend this series.",1191542400,4,391,5.426229508196721

2734296,5,B000MGBSQM,"I ""grew up"" watching Ironside. I just watched the first two DVD's in this package today. They are great! I mean when you consider today's advances in technology while you're watching these you'll probably wonder why they didn't do something different. The plots are always interesting and revolve around Ironside's abilities to solve difficult cases. I've always enjoyed his performances in both Perry Mason and Ironside and am ready to order the second season now!",1186272000,3,465,5.213333333333333
2734297,5,B000MGBSQM,"I tought that Ironside is one of the best shows from the late 60s early 70s. Especially Raymond Burr and his acting of a police chief in a wheelchair and the way that you can understand the way the character brought across. It tells you at the beginning how Robert Ironside is taking a vacation from work, in a ranch owned by his friend and where he get shot while on the telephone.

You can also understand the way people in wheelchairs of today feel about their independence and their willing to go out places. I recommend Ironside to anyone who like police adventures.",1184198400,3,571,4.490384615384615
2734298,5,B000MGBSQM,"I initially wasn't sure if this series would hold up with age (I saw it last when I was about 12 sometime in the early 90's and loved it) but I have to say I'm enjoying it more now than I did the first time around!  Raymond Burr is brilliant, every ounce the angry, genius, occasionally depressed detective.  Unlike other similar shows from this era (like Dragnet), the counterculture plays (for the most part) a kind of lovely idyllic background.  This show makes me very jealous of anyone who was fortunate enough to experience San Francisco in 1967!",1182902400,2,552,4.612244897959184
2734299,5,B000MGBSQM,"I watched Ironside in B&W (my TV was not a color machine) when it was first broadcast in 1967.  It is a riveting show, well produced, with likable, strong, dedicated characters on a mission, led by Chief of Detectives Ironside--not a man in a wheel chair, paralyzed from the waist down by a wet-behind-the-ears disgruntled frustrated would-be assassin; but IRONSIDE in a wheel chair.  The show Ironside felt the pulse of the times bang-on:  Drainage of the nation's best and strongest to Southeast Asia to fight the very controversial Vietnam War, even as university students opted out with college deferments and rallied, protested, and rioted against the war; and some got killed, as in the Kent State incident.  Dwindling support for law and order, and chaos grew and spread.  The police were made more vulnerable; a president was brought down, President Nixon.  After he was shot in the back by the sniper, Ironside was allowed by the police commissioner to continue on duty as a special consultant; given space to work, and whatever he needed.  He then assembled a crack team of crime fighters who were top-drawer, admirable, dedicated, likable people.  Watching the team in action against smart, sophisticated criminals is satisfying and entertaining.  Ironside is as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was first aired in 1967.  Five Stars.",1181606400,6,1354,5.031390134529148
2734300,5,B000MGBSQM,"I really had a blast watching the first season of Ironside.

I was a fan of the show in the early 1970s and saw the earlier episodes in syndication.

However, the show hasn't been seen too often since the 1970s so watching it now was almost like seeing the episodes for the first time.

Obviously, the dialogue and settings of the cases are dated since the show utilized the counterculture that existed in San Francisco during the late 1960s. However, the cases are so well done and such a contrast to the multi-layered structure of today's crime shows in which tidbits of character are sprinkled among the scenes in which the detectives are investigating the crimes that the out-of-date dialogue and settings don't get in the way.

Another thing I enjoyed about watching these episodes was being able to spot future stars. The DVD covers list the obvious ones such as Edward Asner, Harrison Ford, Susan Saint James, Vera Miles, and Gavin McLeod, but it was fun finding others. For example, the uncredited actor who plays a bellhop and has one line in one episode is clearly Mike Farrell, who later went on to star in M*A*S*H* and Providence, and an artist in another show is played by Nicholas Colosanto from Cheers.",1180915200,9,1217,4.726415094339623
2734301,5,B000MGBSQM,"Raymond Burr was known for two great TV roles-Perry Mason and Robert Ironside...and NO ONE (other than Burr) HAS EVER SUCEEDED in playing these two characters (and no one has played Ironside). Burr is Ironside and we are glad for it!

This DVD collection is full season of 28 episodes, the  first Season. This  stuff is truly timeless. This , to my knowledge , was first time there was a handicapped (wheelchaired) hero as  a starrring role in a series on TV. In 40 years that has past, this  mystery  series bearly dates itself.  The masters of these episodes  seem clean and almost as good as if theyt would be seen today, almost vault quality stuff. Shout DVD  you did well!

I remember watching this armchair Sherlock in awe...and I still have the sense of awe viewing these today

One would wish one of the other Ironside costars (Don Mitchell, Don Galloway or Barbara Anderson) would talk about the show in an audio commentary, about Raymond Burr, Show, the scripts, etc. However there is  No such luck..However these episodes are fine  without extras

So wheel down to the buy this and get this today

2734302,5,B000MGBSQM,I purchased the Ironside DVD's for my mother.  She has enjoyed watching them and is waiting for the next season to come out on dvd.,1179705600,5,131,4.24
2734303,5,B000MGBSQM,"I grew up on this series....I watched the very first showing of the pilot movie at about age 8, and it went off the air while I was in high school.  The show was a big favorite of mine through all those years.  To my knowledge, it never was big in the syndication market, I watched a few episodes late-night on weekends in the late 1980s, but I have seldom seen the show since the original airings.  Now it is back!

I've seen the pilot movie and three of the episodes, and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Ironside is just as he was, gruff and focused on facts. Mark doesn't seem as much of a rugged and vaguely threatening tough guy as he did to my young and unworldly self.  Many of the guest stars are familiar faces from the stable of tv actors in the 60s.  Some I recognize, but don't know names, others moved on to greater things, such as Kent McCord (later of Adam-12) as a rural motorcycle cop, Kathleen Freeman, and best of all, Tiny Tim playing (essentially) himself in the pilot.

In some ways, production values and self-censorship reflect prime time tv in the 1960s.  In the pilot, Ironside is shot through the spine and left overnight, but when he's found in the morning there's not a trace of blood on him or the porch!  There's certainly a bias for ""The Establishment"".  On the other hand, having a substantially handicapped title character and highlighting the challenges he faces from his handicap was a pretty bold move for the time.

As a fan of the original, I'm glad to see it back, and I love it.  I suspect those who were around during the original broadcasts but weren't fans will like it if they find the concept of the show appealing.  I'm not confident of the reaction of anyone under their 40s to this, though.

I'd rather not see the shows time compressed as identified by another reviewer, though I can't say it is a substantial problem.",1178150400,7,1862,4.451327433628318
