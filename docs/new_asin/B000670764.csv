The production values are decent, you can hear him clearly, the room? has the back wall? a covered light fabric & he doesn't move around much. It's a single camera & he mostly faces you sideways which is great.
He gets right to the point & the warm up is teaching you how to walk & basic bounces & hip hop body wave.
He goes straight to break dancing moves like the old 80s drop beat, 6 step (classic break dancing on the ground), Alpha, and the Glide (moonwalk style moving kinda in a square) that Usher used on his video.
Gregg uses great analogies.. such as for the body wave, you use your hands to guide the wave & says, ""Be very afraid of your hands....""  When he gets low on the ground he says ""Keep your booty off the oor-tay"" For the Alpha, you drop back on your hands & feet & reminds you to keep your elbows bent, ""Because you look stiff & you'll be walking around like this *impression of Frankenstein* & everyone will ask you 'what happened?' & you'll have to say, 'nothing...'"" I'm trying to capture his humor the best my memory will allow. You will not get bored & he doesn't force the jokes. Even teaching the 6 step, he first tells you to do the ballet padavouree? which is step back, step side step back... & shows you normal standing, then kinda in a circle, then has you drop down & do it slow on the floor then slowly speed it up. He's very patient, doesn't rush it, does everything slowly & slowly speeds it up to normal tempo.

There are so few dance instructors who have videos like him. They should all take a cue from him.

As one female reviewer said, as far as I could tell, yes, this is mostly male dancing steps, but sure some female dancers can put their own spin/style into some of the old school moves. Another said it was mostly break dancing & the beginning is, but not some of the end stuff. J. Arva's & Dancer 2's 2004 review is very accurate along with Fineliving style's 2006 review.

In the credits he's dancing & lotta old 90s stuff, I think even a Rerun ""what's happening now"" moves & some basic pop & locks w/ a hip hop sustained handstand thrown in.",1187395200,,2199,4.253588516746412
8039482,2,B000670764,"I was very disappointed with this video.  I had hoped, based on other reviews and the factory blurb, that this would help me dance like good dancers in hip hop clubs.  Well, that is not what it teaches.

If you want to learn to break dance and fling yourself on the floor and spin around, then buy this video--after all, he is a good instructor.  But if you want true club or music video HIP HOP dancing, look elsewhere.

Additionally, women (like me) probably wouldn't find this video helpful because the moves are very butch.",1173571200,3,527,4.505263157894737
8039483,5,B000670764,"This is a great instructional DVD for beginners and for people who needs reliable moves to take to the dance floor.

The best thing I could say about this DVD is that Gregg teaches easy moves and make them look fancy so people would look like better dancers than they really are.

Save for the floor work( which people don't do on dance floors anyway unless you're a performer) and 1 cut move, coordination and athleticism is not require to do the dance moves.",1138233600,4,460,4.464285714285714
8039484,3,B000670764,"Honey, at last I've found the video for us. I have been trying very hard to learn to dance for you and I think now I can know how. You will not need to go dance with other guys any more. I can dance! I mean it! Just please watch me go sometime with the Fuzion video. I am ready to spice up our lives.",1130544000,6,300,3.6307692307692307
8039485,4,B000670764,"I bought this for my teenaged sons.  They haven't watched it yet, but I have, and found it to be well done.  I think they will enjoy it.  The reviews I read helped me to pick this product and I was pleased with the selection.",1127001600,,225,3.9555555555555557
8039486,5,B000670764,"Hip Hop Fusion provides a good variety of hip hop moves very well presented by Gregg Russell!

Very helpful!",1125187200,,108,4.684210526315789
8039487,5,B000670764,"Finally! A ""how-to"" dance dvd that you can actually LEARN from! After purchasing several other Hip Hop videos I was discouraged by the ""performance"" value rather than the ""instruction"" part. On this DVD Gregg Russell is a great dancer as well as an inspiring teacher. He really breaks down all the moves (from the back-thank you) so it's much easier to follow. I also liked the fact that is a one hour tape and not ANY time is wasted on excess chit chat-it's all pure instruction and dance moves. You get a short warm-up, alot of break dance moves, and a really cool dance routine. The dance is long, so I'm learning it in small sections at my own pace. Plus, Russell really is a cool guy and very funny! I was totally entertained and enlightened by this DVD. 5 stars",1102032000,29,767,4.446808510638298
8039488,4,B000670764,"A good video to learn hip-hop moves and have a good time doing it. It's a good balance of teaching you slow yet moving fast enough that you can do the DVD over and over again. If you are new to dance, it will certianly take time and frequent rewinding to catch on. If you're experienced, it can still be challenging to get it ""look and feel right"". It's a long and (to me) complicated coreography. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars, is that the warm-up is really short (you're supposed to stop the DVD and continue yourself), and there is no cool-down. The complete coreography is also not repeated at the end, which means you need to rewind.",1100563200,19,647,4.2682926829268295
