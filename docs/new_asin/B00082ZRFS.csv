8055435,4,B00082ZRFS,"Interesting movie about eugenics. We, as a culture, tend to lean toward this thinking, which is very dangerous and unhealthy. We need to recognize that the human race is not perfect and there is much to be celebrated in that. Prettiest, smartest, fastest, most fit, etc. are all values relative to who decides what is acceptable. When we start playing God and deciding that people should be sterilized - and others not - we invite corruption (i.e.,Gattaca) and leave no room for hope (i.e.,The Giver). The example in this movie of the lawyer's son who was mentally ill - a killer - who was ""protected"" from being rejected because his father was well known shows how this thinking leads to corruption. The father's pride was more important than the objective of ""purifying society."" One can only imagine the ramifications to one's life and career if their own child was considered a reprobate. It's interesting that this movie was made in 1934, before WW2 - before the holocaust. It's interesting that we don't hear about how America was (and some American entities still are!) supportive, involved and practiced eugenics - much like what the Germans practiced during WW2. The holocaust brought to light how abhorrent the concept of eugenics is yet it is still promoted in subtle ways around the world even today. This movie may be old but it is certainly not outdated. It's one that should be watched and discussed. It is as much a current issue as abortion, euthanasia and other life-impacting beliefs and practices. We need to be aware and respectful. We need to protect humanity from itself.",1470614400,2,1594,4.885608856088561

The movie revolves around the subject of Negative Eugenics.  Negative Eugenics involves any method used to keep people considered racially, socially or biologically inferior from reproducing ""their kind.""  Eugenic's believes it can better the human stock by weeding out the so called weak or undesirable traits thought to be gentically inherited.  Backward thinking states used sterilization of people it deemed mentally, socially or criminally defective or degenerate to weed such individuals out of the public gene pool.  Ignorant people in backward states felt eliminating the so called feeble minded was in the state and public best interest.  Eugenics is basically just another scientifically posh word for race, diversity and social hatred of the type made infamous by Nazi's under Adolf Hitler and his foul ilk.

This movie takes us into a family of the most backward loathesome criminals, mental defectives and moral degenerates you could imagine.  The father is a lazy shiftless drunk who cares more about himself than anyone else.  The mother is just a dim wit carried along life by sheer dumb luck, riding the crest of life in ignorant bliss as her own ignorance drags her to an early grave.  One son is physically disabled and all but mindless.  Another son has the IQ of a spent gum wrapper as he plays by making toys of his derelict drunk fathers many empty booze bottles. A good hearted but stupid doctor thinks he is doing this sick family a favor by getting them, ""Welfare!""  Unfortunately in this state Welfare comes with a terrible price to pay.  You guessed it.  The State gets to (Sterilize the whole family!)  Sterilize as in render all the members of the afflicted family unable to have children.

What makes this movie so creepy is the ghoulish Nazi like ways doctors, social workers and cops work together to corner then destroy this poor weak family of mindless infantile dolts.  The state treats the people it captures for Sterilization like dumb brutes hauling the poor dears off to a hospital like so many budensome animals who must be ""Fixed for their own good!""  I find it odd that in the United States we actually had social workers, doctors and police running around backward states targeting and rounding up poor, ignorant people it labeled defective.  The behavior of backward states sterilizing people against their will suggests that long before Adolf Hitler the United States was taking the first halting steps to its own ""FINAL SOLUTION OF ITS FEEBLE MINDED AND DISABILITY PROBLEM!""  The other scary part of this DVD for me is the fact that I have 13 disabilities.  My sister has a few.  However the main premise of the Tomorrows Children DVD Video suggests that families of so called disabled ""Genetically Inferior"" off spring will be a sure fire automatic burden to the state hence making Sterilization the only way to control the menance posed by us.

However despite my 13 disabilities and autism I have never been arrested.  I have never engaged in a lifetime of purely criminal conduct.  I have no children of my own.  I am not and have never been an alcoholic.  I am not particularly violent.  I am a black man.  Both myself and my disabled sibling came from humble beginnings.  Yet today we both enjoy good jobs.  I have a very good job.  I have a nice home.  I pay my taxes and am NOT on welfare.  Eugenically based on the negative sterilization eugenics message in this Tomorrows Children movie I should be an utter failure, a burden to the state and worse.  I am instead highly successful happy and I have contributed much to enhance the quality of life in our society.

In the final analysis this movie side steps the powerful message it could have sent by dealing directly with huge morality issues associated with state sponsored forced sterilization.  The movie uses a trick of birth to suggest the person about to be butchered by the State Sterilization Nazi's was not actually biologically related to the family of imbeciles who raised her.  However for the time of its release this little movie had guts taking on the Sterilization mindset growing in the United States where some 20 states had forced sterilization laws on the books that targeted the most poor, disabled folks.  This movie reminds us just how close the United States came to walking down the same Eugenics hell hole that spawned the ignorant arrogant culture of hate that was the heart and soul of Nazi Germany.  Eugenics is just another tool of hate its proponants want others to buy into.  Unfortunately Eugenics is just the most perverse evil immaginable wrapped in its most finest well crafted and alluring packaging.  This DVD proves what a wise lady once shared with me, that DRECK IS STILL GARBAGE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO FRESHEN IT UP!",1345507200,3,4909,4.872135102533172

8055439,4,B00082ZRFS,"Tomorrow's Children is one of those early, low budget talkie films that are remarkably and embarrassingly dated. The language used to refer to persons with developmental disabilities and people who are physically disabled is not desirable; but that's the way people spoke at the time. The plot moves along at a good pace; and this is a good thing because the entire film is a whopping 52 minutes long. The casting is good except for the older Mason couple; they appear too old to be bringing babies into the world. Otherwise, for its time and budget, the cinematography is good and the choreography works well. The film is clearly making its point against eugenics; this was probably a ""liberal"" belief at the time.

When the action begins we quickly meet Alice Mason (Diane Sinclair) and her fianc Jim Baker (Carlyle Moore Jr.). Jim is eager to marry Alice; and although she wants to marry him she worries about her family--she's the sole breadwinner and they need her. Mr. and Mrs. Mason (Arthur Wanzer and Sarah Padden) drink way too much and they cannot hold work although they use the Great Depression as an excuse to not even try to look for work. Instead, the Masons have yet another child while Alice works! Alice has a younger brother who is developmentally disabled; one of her brothers is in jail and another has a bum leg so he can't walk much. Therefore, Dr. Brooks, a kindly family practitioner, refers their case to the state welfare board--but to keep the much needed welfare assistance the Masons must sign paperwork authorizing sterilization for the family!

Alice Mason is extremely upset by this but her parents sign her paperwork regardless of her feelings. Jim, of course, is quite upset and so is Dr. Brooks who doesn't believe Alice has ""tainted"" blood in her. The judge in the court, however, recommends that Alice be sterilized. Of course, this same judge is not above giving out favors to his cronies when it's their own children who need to be sterilized--the judge ""conveniently"" looks the other way and issues an order against their surgeries. Some judge he is!

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. What will or can Mr. and Mrs. Mason do, if anything, to reverse their decision about having Alice sterilized? Will Alice, Jim and Dr. Brooks be able to convince the judge to change the court order? What about Mrs. Mason--is she hiding a secret that could explode the whole issue wide open? Watch and find out!

The DVD doesn't come with many extras. The quality of the print is actually rather good and the sound quality is also pretty good. I never had any trouble understanding what people were saying.

Overall, Tomorrow's Children holds your attention and it makes its point with drama in a snappy 52 minutes. Despite the drawback of the embarrassing use of inappropriate language to refer to disabled people, I would recommend it for people who study social issues from the past. Some of the people who enjoy early talkie movies will want to consider this for their collections, too.",1238025600,3,3028,4.782026768642448
8055440,3,B00082ZRFS,"When I first heard the title of this film, Tomorrow's Children (1934), I thought it was perhaps some sort of futuristic science fiction tale, but what I actually got was a cinematic railing against the practice of forced sterilization.  Scoff if you will (I did), but apparently this wasn't an uncommon practice.  It's estimated nearly some 60,000 people in the U.S. were subjected to this program, beginning sometime around 1907 and continued up until the 1970's, most prevalent during the 1930's and 1940's.  Proponents pushed the eugenics factor of the program, hoping to use it as a means to breed out genetic defects by stopping a bloodline (convicted criminals were often offered less prison time if they acquiesced to the procedure), but opponents often cited the victims were generally either poor and/or of minority groups.  Essentially what it boiled down to is if the gooberment thought your bloodline had some sort of `taint', they could legally force a surgical procedure on you to prevent you from ever having children.  Directed by Crane Wilbur (High School Girl, The Bat), the film stars Diane Sinclair (Damaged Lives), Donald Douglas (Tarzan and the Amazons), and Carlyle Moore Jr. (High School Girl).  Also appearing is Arthur Wanzer (High School Girl), Sarah Padden (Joe Palooka, Champ), Sterling Holloway (probably best know as the voice of Winnie the Pooh), and the director himself as the character of Father O'Brien.

As the film begins we meet a young couple named Jim Baker (Moore) and Alice Mason (Sinclair).  They talk of marriage and have dreams of babies, breakfast nooks, and radios (this was the 30s', so the radio was pretty much it for your home entertainment center).  Problem is Alice doesn't feel comfortable leaving her family behind, especially since she's the main source of income (besides welfare), and her mother has just had a miscarriage (Ma Mason looks a little long in the tooth to be getting pregnant, but I suppose having kids ages you somewhat...Pa ain't no spring chicken either).  As Dr. Brooks (Douglas) brings Ma (Padden) home, he learns (as we do), the rest of the family ain't doing all that hot as Pa is a rummy (he lika the drink, he lika it a lot), two of the boys are feeble-minded (a common term back in the day), a third is a congenital cripple (another common term back in the day), and a fourth in jail...gee, they seem like the perfect candidates for selective eugenics...anyway, upon seeing their plight (Pa, by the way, could care less about Ma losing the baby as it's one less mouth to feed), makes a report to the state welfare board in hopes of getting them some much needed extra assistance, but the result is a couple of smooth talking state officials arrive and convince Ma and Pa that the best thing for them is state subsidized sterilization, the including the kids...which means Alice, who is only 17 and seems not afflicted with the family `taint', has no choice in the matter (neither did the parents, as the state threatened to withhold welfare money of they resisted).  Not wanting her baby factory shut down, Alice takes it on the lam but gets nabbed by the bulls.  Alice gets a hearing, with Dr. Brooks present (feeling quite guilty), but it's of no use...it's the knife for Alice, unless Jim and Dr. Brooks can find a way to stop the state sponsored madness...

Despite the extremely heavy-handed attempt to push forth the message that forced sterilization is a bad thing (both sides are presented, but it's obvious pretty early on which camp the writer resides in), I actually enjoyed this film, melodrama and all (when I say enjoyed, I mean I laugh my, well, you know, off).  The funniest thing about the film is the sense of necessity of the writer and the director to feel like they had to show the very most extreme situations in order to best get their point across.  This is illuminated by a hilarious scene involving a criminal getting the big `V' in order to reduce his jail sentence, and during the operation he keeps talking about how they'll never cut the `bad' out of him, and when he gets out, he's going to raise as much hell as he ever did...another scene involved an obviously deranged individual with giant eyebrows and pasty pallor (played up for effect) just before he's about to go before the judge for his hearing on whether or not he's to be sterilized...just before he goes into court he rips a nurse's dress off and leers at her half nekkid form, just so we know the guy is a real psycho (subtly isn't a strength in this film)...but a well connected psycho as he gets off due to the fact his parents are very wealthy and have many influential friends, including a senator, who actually appears on the crazed man's behalf...oh bruther...this was an obvious attempt to `display' the inequities between the poor and disenfranchised and the wealthy and influential....I got news for you, no matter what issue we're talking about, the wealthy will always have an edge over the rest...that's one of the benefits of being wealthy.  There's a good deal of superficial talk about moralistic and societal concerns, the `justifiable' benefits and obvious shortcomings of such programs, along with individual rights vs. the public good.  There's also a bit in the middle as Dr. Brooks outlines the specifics of the procedure (in both men and women) to an uneducated man about to go under the knife (half the people in the film, probably as well as the audience, knew what sterilization was...'Steril-whut?').  The acting is so so, nothing spectacular and the direction decent.  One of the best things about this film (beside the unintentional hilarity) is the pacing is very quick, cramming a whole lot of material into a mere 52 minute run time, leading up to an exciting and tense climax at the end.

This Alpha Video DVD release actually features something I'm not accustom to with their usual releases, a decent picture...and to top it off, the audio comes across very strong...neither are perfect, but much better than I would have expected.  There really aren't any special features in relation to the film, but there are previews for a number of craptacular, direct-to-video low budget/no budget films including post apocalyptic schlocker titled Blood of the Beast (2003), Just Add Pepper (2002), Candy Von Dewd (2002), Magdalen (1998), A Chronicle of Corpses (2000), The Devil's Filmmaker: Bohica (2003), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (2002)...actually, this last one looks very decent, along with some DVD double features including Jan-Gel 3: Hillbilly Monster/Grandparents from Outer Space and Jan-Gel, the Beast from the East/Jan-Gel 2: The Beast Returns...why is it every schmuck with a video camera fancies himself a director?  Probably for the same reasons I fancy myself a critic...

By the way, the most horrifying aspect of this film was that relating to Ma's miscarriage...horrifying because it led me to the supposition that Ma and Pa Mason were still engaging in the horizontal mambo which is a thought no one should have to be subjected to...",1119916800,13,7066,4.883876357560568
