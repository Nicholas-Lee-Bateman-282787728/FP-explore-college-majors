3028604,5,B000YFR7H0,"I have the Feel Better Now yoga dvd by Gary Halperin. It's great.
The quality is really, really good.
I like the colors that they chose, the red and white clothes against the ocean and sand background are a good, clean, clear image. I like that the 3 participants were of varying ages and abilities. And the green grass and sailboats were cool.
As far as the workout itself, it was easy to follow. I appreciate that. His voice was clear and stable and his cues were simple and short. That's perfect for a beginner.
The time is a good amount for a beginner. I feel like I got a full body workout. I like the phrases ""do as best as you can today"" and Gary's other comments were reassuring.
I would recommend this dvd to any of my friends or students who want a good full body stretch. I use it in combination with my jogging twice a week. It's a good, high quality production. I am really glad I bought it. Kristi",1200182400,4,911,4.241379310344827

8232581,5,B000YFR7H0,"Yoga practice creates a feeling of mindfulness as well as getting in tune with your body and inner self,  Gary's DVD does exactly that.
 The yoga positions are easy to follow - along with a backdrop of the Gulf of Mexico -  what could be better!",1444348800,,245,4.282608695652174
8232582,5,B000YFR7H0,This dvd is excellent for those who have never tried yoga and also so. Beneficial for those thst have years of practice.  Being a yoga teacher myself and having Gary as one of my teachers has been a very mindful profound ongoing experience whether in the classroom or enjoying the dvd.,1443657600,,285,4.588235294117647

8232584,5,B000YFR7H0,"I have taken Gary Halperin's yoga classes in Sarasota, Florida and at the Coolfont Resort in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.  I was so thrilled to find this dvd.  The class on the dvd is just like Gary's live classes:  clear instruction, meditative, relaxing, and postures that anyone can do.  It would be great for Beginners or for anyone looking to get more flexible and experience deep relaxation.  Highly recommended",1442534400,,421,5.043478260869565

8232586,5,B000YFR7H0,"I ordered this item based on the previous reviews, it turned out to be exactly what I needed to get back to practicing yoga.  I haven't practiced for about 5 years and now that I am pushing 70 decided to ease my way back into it, this is a perfect new beginning.  I am particularly interested in balance issues and the way Mr. Halperin presents those poses make them both comfortable and effective. I would recommend this to anyone particularly people my age as a good way to begin.  Mr. Halperin has a very nice way of talking you through the poses in a non intimidating way.  I am very happy I bought this DVD.",1285718400,3,612,4.2956521739130435
8232587,5,B000YFR7H0,"This is a new yoga DVD and new instructor to me so it was a bit of an ""experiment"" to buy it and try it. My family and I like Kripalu style yoga and have several other Kripalu yoga DVDs; we are not ""experts"" by any means but have some familiarity and experience. We have found Gary Halperin's DVD to be very useful and one we will use often for our home practice. The instruction is clear and well paced and the postures are innovative in some ways, although also based in familiar postures. In keeping with Kripalu style, there is emphasis on breathing and, as the instructor says, self-acceptance throughout the practice. It is appreciated in that it does not overtax any single body part - for example, having one remain on the knees for protracted period of time, yielding very sore knees, as some yoga DVDs do - but it does involve the entire body. It contains some excellent balancing poses and some handy tips for establishing foot placement in some poses. I thought it also contained the very best way I have learned for moving into and out of downward dog and I appreciated that very much! The instructor's voice is carefully modulated and clear; the setting is beautiful and calming. The three people featured in the video are appropriately dressed and of ""normal people"" ability. The relaxation phase of the practice is wonderful and nicely guided by the instructor, with the calming, low sound of the ocean waves in the background. My only question of the practice came with the instruction to ""bend at the waist"" for some poses, rather than the usual ""bend at the hips"", for protection of the back. We just bent at the hips anyway and it was fine. It's a nice practice and a good addition to one's yoga DVD video library. We did ""feel better now"" after doing this DVD practice! Recommended.",1283385600,3,1803,4.60248447204969
8232588,5,B000YFR7H0,"I own this DVD and have given it as a gift to friends because it is a good way to get into practicing YOGA regularly. They agree. I use it to fill in between classes and when on vacation, so my instructor is never far away. The DVD is beautiful, real people are doing YOGA with the instructor, and the setting is a beautiful beach. Even though it seems easy to do all the poses and stretches, it is amazing that by the end you know you've done something good for you body. I definitely do feel better when I'm done and I recommend this DVD to anyone who is currently practicing YOGA or wants to begin practicing. You won't be sorry.",1218067200,5,632,4.188524590163935
8232589,5,B000YFR7H0,"I am also a Kripalu yoga teacher, in Minnesota. I have dozens of books, CDs, and DVDs. I was looking through my collection for one to recommend to my students when I pulled this one out and watched it again today. It feels perfect to me, a slow-paced, meditative yoga class, that works on balance, strength, flexibily, stress reduction, and relaxation. The people in the DVD look like normal people. The poses are ones anyone can do. The instructor does a wonderful job not only leading us mindfully into the pose, but also speaking of what to notice in the pose, and then leading us to mindfully release the pose. His voice is soothing, the water setting is relaxing.",1214092800,7,668,4.621848739495798
