4740417,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus was a titan who stole fire from the Gods, gave it to the humans and prevented Zeus from obliterating the human race. In punishment God chained him to a rock and bade an eagle perpetually eat his liver.

In Ridley Scott's new film we open with sweeping aerial shots over a steaming, blasted landscape that may be Icelandic and may be Martian. We alight on a waxen figure of titanic Grecian aspect, standing astride a great waterfall, who may be Prometheus himself, ""chained"" to his ""rock"". Overhead, a higher power is concluding a visit. It does not appear to have been a cordial one.

I do not know this for sure, and Scott does not explain further. That mysteries are more potent unexploded is a significant theme of this motion picture.

We are pitched forward 35 millennia, to 2093, and into the face of Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an anthropologist out in the field, clawing at an aperture into a concealed cavern with cavalier disregard for that theme. Dr Shaw and her partner Dr Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered cave paintings suggestive of the intervention of an advanced civilisation. This is, of course, the stuff of Erich von Dniken, fashionable as long ago as the 1970s but long since discredited. Nonetheless, Shaw and Holloway propose a multi-billion dollar, ten year expedition to a remote star system to further investigate. Elderly philanthropist Weyland (a rubber-suited Guy Pierce) green-lights the proposal.

It must have been one hell of a business pitch.

We jump forward a further four years and 50 billion light years (the laws of physics being due an overhaul between now and 2090) to the spaceship Prometheus, which has arrived at that star system. Without ado the ship fetches up on a blasted, steaming landscape, adjacent to a quite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/von-Dnikenesque/dp/0425166805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">von Dnikenesque</a>&nbsp;archaeological complex.

House android David (an excellently Hal-like Michael Fassbinder) and ship commander Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) are busily waking up their scientists and nursing hidden agendas. It quickly becomes clear that the crew of scientists, shaken from their stupor, have their own agendas too. Thus do we conform to the deep space adventure playbook established by the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B000HEBCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>&nbsp;and, well, Alien. Yet note a dissonance here: just as the dialogue starts in earnest, Scott shifts our gaze from the reverend contemplation of the immortal to the petty melodramas of some new characters with whom we cannot, yet, empathise. Naturally there are figurative parallels but, all the same, this shift in perspective risks rendering the cosmic mundane.

I mention this because but for the wonderful production design and those grand metaphysical thoughts there is really nothing really new about the first hour of Prometheus. It is to Alien what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2010-The-Year-We-Make-Contact/dp/B000HF4U04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a>&nbsp;was to 2001. In place of ineffable profundity there is talky exposition.

Ridley Scott renders the cosmic mundane in another way too: We are treated again to HR Giger's stunning necro-organic architecture, rendered briefly in Alien and largely unexplained in the form of a ghastly skeleton with a blown out rib-cage. But this time Scott indulges in exposition: he begins to fill in the details of this race of bermensch, ascribing them motives and agendas. We even meet one. It was better not knowing.

In Alien the titillating ambiguity of their remnants left the job of world construction to the viewer. In Prometheus Scott takes away the viewer's autonomy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00498VS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;dictates a back story, and opens himself wide to plot illogicalities and non-sequiturs. Disappointingly the Engineers' motivations are base, predictable, and not worthy of the phallic grandeur of Giger's production design.

By half time in this two hour picture the studied monkishness of its opening has entirely given way to melodramatic space opera, rendered in haphazardly-directed action set pieces. As convention dictates, the dysfunctional crew must be picked off, but this is accompanied by none of the grimness of Scott's original, because the characters are only caricatures of the real men and women we met aboard the Nostromo.

There are, generally, too many of them, and they spend too much of the picture gabbing at each other in the meter of stock Hollywood dialogue, depriving the screenplay of the air it needs to work up a genuine chill or to properly frame its grand eternal cogitations.  There are about three false summits before the final denouement, which falls on an offbeat not quite accented enough to justify its build up.

This makes me sound too negative: I enjoyed Prometheus a great deal, but hoped to enjoy it immensely more still. It is a beautiful picture to look at, and many of the action set pieces are well executed (Noomi Rapace has her own John Hurt moment, self-inflicted, and it is in equal parts horrifying and (deliberately) hilarious.

Ridley Scott has famously railed against studio demands to tinker with the final edits of his pictures. Here, I suspect he had full autonomy. I left the cinema wondering what might have been had someone been more assiduous in that regard: this is a good movie which could have been made great had there been a director more prepared to cut.

4740419,4,B005LAIHY0,"I must admit, ever since buzz about an ""Alien prequel"" started floating around the internet about two years ago, I've been in a state of intense anticipation. When I discovered that the project had moved in another direction and became Prometheus, I, like many other fans, began following the near endless stream of trailers, images, and viral videos that have been churned out for the film the last few months, all the while eagerly latching onto each new show of the ""space jockey"" or allusion to Alien.

Then I saw the film. I must admit that my disappointment was partially my own fault for letting myself get carried away by the hype, but the studio ought to have some regret for stoking such anticipation for what they must have known is film that is little more than average. Or perhaps that's why they did it. Either way, the film gets off to a rather nice start, and the first hour is, particularly for Alien fans, quite enjoyable. Seeing the crew explore a derelict ship like the one in Alien, finding its crew of ""space jockeys"" and the persistent about-to-become-an-Alien-movie allusion to the original film are enough to have me, and most of the audience, on the edge of their seats. Then the film reaches the hour mark, and it's all down hill from there. The script runs out of steam, resorting to twists such as Guy Pearce's appearance on the ship and the yawn-inducing ""twist"" that Charlize Theron's character is his daughter. Characters such as David, that had been set up in the first half as scheming and multi-faceted, suddenly become flat, and characters seem to forget what had happened earlier in the film (where's the tension between Noomi Rapace and Theron after she kills Holloway? What about David's role in infecting him with the virus? IT'S ALL FORGOTTEN). Worse still, the trailers had literally spoiled all of the scenes we get with the various alien creatures, from the hammerpede to the tentacle monster. What we saw in the trailers is all there is, and much of the ending, with the space jockey ship being hit by the Prometheus, is also ruined in the ads. The ending, while interesting, is shameless for the extent to which is drops any attempt to answer the questions posed in the film, instead setting up for the inevitable Prometheus 2. The last shot, while interesting, is also an entirely predictable shout out to Alien fans that I, and judging from their reaction the whole audience, thought was poorly done. The movie also consistently breaks its own logic, and the constant to-and-fro from the Prometheus to the derelict feels both unnecessary and pointlessly frenetic. While the set designs and the planet Scott creates are impressive, I never felt very drawn into the film's atmosphere after the story leaves the derelict for the first time. The music is entirely bland, and I frequently didn't even notice that it was there.

As for the characters, I was shocked by how one dimensional and static they were, especially given the all-star cast. While Fassbender is predictably good as David, the character itself is hindered by a script that forgets halfway through what makes the character interesting. While Rapace does a decent job as Shaw, some of her dialog delivery was so poor I actually cringed. Would it have killed them to do a second take on some of these scenes? The rest of the cast is entirely unmemorable, save for Idris Elba-who is himself underutilized-, particularly Logan Marshal-Green, who is killed off so early and in such an uninspiring fashion that I found myself wondering why they even bothered having the character in the first place.

Overall, setting aside my own self-inflicted hype disappointment, Prometheus is an undeniably mediocre film that will tickle the fancy of Alien fans in some respects, but will satisfy no one's expectations. Still, I recommend the film to Alien fans for the hint of magic that the film has. I just wish they had aspired to more than the middle ground of unoffensive mediocrity.

EDIT:
Upon seeing the film a second time, I can honestly say that it's good. Once you have any expectations that it will be an Alien film removed by the first viewing (which I found jarring, hence my poor initial reaction) you can really enjoy it as its own film.

4740420,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prologue

Albino Watchman downs a caviar/tequila slammer next to a waterfall then disintegrates into the stream. Project Mankind or a renegade's gift to the third rock?

Project Prometheus

Sci-fi epic, 33yrs in the making, turns out to be a two hour, 500 yard shuttle run between two spaceships.
The loose mythological core mirrors Prometheus (Space Jockey), his gift of fire to humans (evolution via Black DNA Caviar), and his subsequent punishment by the Gods (genetic vengeance via the Evil Caviar).
Hence we have a Clash of the Titans: White Super Engineers vs. Evil Black Goo, with Mankind, the accidental product, caught in the middle. I could try to explain the story to you, but here's a better idea:  You explain it to me...

Fire (DNA Caviar)

Location: Planet LV-226; Space Jockey stomping ground. In a cemetery of thermos flasks, in a worm infested H.R. Giger museum. This caviar is genetic plutonium, primordial evil, the evolutionary fire of the gods.

This black temple introduces the film's heart of darkness: the consequence of playing God. Humans invent androids because they can. Engineers invent humans because they can, but the unexplained question is, why then try destroy us? Fassbender's android gifts us the closest answer: ""To create you must first destroy"". So is our black caviar the evolutionary equivalent of a forest fire, and its purpose the purification of the gene pool? If not purification, then perhaps weaponisation, with humans as guinea pigs? But 2,000 years seems an awfully long manufacturing period. And let's be honest, why not just build a Death Star?

The most sensible explanation seems that, after their experiment turns on them, the Engineers realise that the black goo is inherently evil (d'uh!) and Mankind, an evolutionary vessel of said evil, becomes an experimental error they seek to rectify through genocide. But why lead us to LV-226 in order to destroy us? Similar wall paintings from civilisations centuries apart suggest repeated visits to Earth. Why not just destroy us at home? Likely the original invitation was a peaceful one, prior to the caviar uprising. Alternative explanations include a lone stranded Prometheus Engineer with a life spanning millenia (where is he now?), or, following the evolutionary weapon theory, the 2000 years delay could, in essence, be cooking time for the optimum genetic recipe, awaiting our technological advance to interstellar travel.

Here now is a quick recap of the Xenomorph life cycle:
Queen - Eggs - Facehugger - Chestburster - Xeno

Not content with the biological plausibility of this, the screenwriters of Prometheus have added the following variations:

DNA Caviar + worm = Vagina Cobra
DNA Caviar + champagne + archaeologist = Zombie
Zombie + sexy time = Woman + baby squid
Little baby squid + a few hours = Giant Kraken
Kraken + Space Jockey = Skinny Mocha Xeno

Prometheus

Elephant masks? Really? Over 30 years I've developed a fondness for the Space Jockeys as herbivore stargazers. Turns out it's just a suit.
For a race of interstellar engineers, the elephant look seems a little dated. If they're only helmets, why are they wearing them indoors, on a spaceship, on a planet with an atmosphere breathable for them? Maybe they're for navigational purposes, but then why would the holocaust pile-up victims in the corridor be wearing them?
Continuity whores take note: How can the original space jockey with a fully intact mask, have a chestburster hole in his sternum? Which hole was the point of entry, if not through the mouth? Butthuggers, anybody?

Next question: What does LV stand for? 226 is not 426 but both have (apparently multiple) crashed croissant ships carrying mutilated Engineers, indicating that the outbreak was spontaneous and galaxy wide. This in turn suggesting that the DNA Caviar was no hand-me-down recipe amongst the Engineers, and the Engineers are not nearly as clever as you think.

Even before we reach the thermos cemetery, the questions outweigh the answers. What was chasing the Engineers? Why did their chests burst? Not even the vagina cobra causes chest-bursting, only the huggers (kracken or face) can do it. So are the huggers only ever the result of a female gestation (Noomi Rapace, the Aliens Bitch Queen or, in this case, the female Engineers?).

Casting

Remember the colonial marines of the starship Sulaco. Vasquez, Hudson, Drake, Frost... how could you forget, right?
Now Prometheus: name the captain? (clue: it's not ""Idris Elba""). How about Noomi's boyfriend? The two stranded scientists or the oriental co-pilot? I'll tell you what their names are: Fodder, Filler, Token, Guy Person and Chang.
Ok, I made the last one up. Thanks Lindelof. Go ahead and throw in the fat guy with curly hair. You know you want to.

For those of you riding the Fassbender bandwagon, allow me to set your canvas roof on fire. Ask yourself this: How does his android compare to Lance Henriksen or Ian Holm? It's a no brainer. Henriksen>Holm>Fassbender>Winona Ryder. Swap the first two if you will, but Fassbender beats only the elfin girl-child. As for his finale... another talking-head? Really?

Special mention has to go to the Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, CGI and set design, which are all engineered to perfection, and completely let down by the script.

Finally a section I like to call...

WTFLOLMFAOMG

1. Android attempts fluent Space Jockese, by studying ancient human texts? Did you just call his mother a slag? Don't lose your head over it.

2. Guy Pearce acting as an old man? Why not use...AN OLD MAN!

3. Heavy face and neck padding on Guy Pearce? Why not use...A FAT OLD MAN!

4. David deciphers every control code at first touch. Hey Engineers, stop using ""password"" as your password.

5. Engineer 1. ""Gentlemen I'm tired of pushing buttons. Any new ideas on how activate this navigation deck?""
Engineer 2. ""Well, I used to play the flute.""
Engineer 1. ""Good work soldier. Now lets go eat some more of that delicious caviar.""

6. Engineer 1. ""Mmm, that caviar was tasty. Now how about we install that new holographic security system.""
Engineer 2. ""But Sir, it only has an 8-bit graphics card, and the intruder tracking doesn't work""
Engineer 1. ""Have you farted?""

7. Oh my god, Weyland is her father!!! So maybe that means they're going to...
Oh wait, they're all dead. So it doesn't matter.

8. Hey Dr. Grey, you've just discovered that the human race is threatened and you have access to an alien craft. Do you...
a) Use it to race back to earth, and use the alien tech to construct the human defence.
b) Confront the entire alien species on your own, with a severed robot head in a duffel bag

The more I write for this review, the less I seem to care. Yet I've been up most of the night figuring this out. At the very least I hope it helps you guys from going through the same.

4740422,1,B005LAIHY0,"This twice revised verdict contains A LOT OF SPOILERS:

This High Court finds the accused guilty of:

1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers
2) soiling his own legacy
3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world
4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers
5) wasting the talent of good actors
6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their ""cool"" factor
7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason
8) using office staples in medicine
9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat

Justification: A LOT was expected from ""Prometheus"". It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath ""Alien"" and in fact not even as good as ""Alien3""... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Blackhawk Down"", etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.

This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class ""direct to DVD"" SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.

As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: ""I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries"". Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.

There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of ""Nostromo"", made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of ""Prometheus"", who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.

In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:

- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!
- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...
- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!
- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!
- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!
- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!
- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...
- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...

Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:

- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!
- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.

This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.

An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking ""Prometheus"" to ""Alien"". The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in ""Alien"" (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from ""Alien"" made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)

Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:

- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.
- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says ""This is the Year of Grace 2093"".
- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))
- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...

Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives one star (instead of zero). 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of ""Blade Runner"" - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.

This is chaotic chaos in a sci-fi setting with nifty graphics, ominous soundtrack and the standard Godless humanism dogmas, The drawn-out fiction might have been dreamed up by a talented creative-writing student with lots of time on their hands and a bunch of sci-fi shows to watch with extra time given to the Alien collection. Someone will love this, but if you share my demographic** then pass on it, UNLESS you might want some MST3000-style laughter. I did start laughing at one point, after the gal gave herself a Ceasarean in the operating booth. At least the ""partial-birth"" abortion was committed on an evil monster resembling Hillary Clinton. A ""choice"" well-made. So if you: are in your fifties, love America, can't believe THEY are still talking about Russia taking over the election, and thank God for our Great American President, then you are somewhat in my demographic.

4740939,4,B005LAIHY0,"I like this movie but I was disappointed all the same.  Prometheus was originally supposed to be a pure prequel but during the long development Scott decided to remove most of the prequel material while still focusing on a major unexplored component of the the Alien universe, ie. the Engineers.  I really wish he had stuck to the original idea of a genuine prequel because the best parts of Prometheus were the prequel elements:  the Engineers look exactly as they did in Alien as does the ship, the planet is in the same solar system as LV-426 from Alien and Aliens, David's deviousness and fundamental inhumanness is even worse than Ash's from the first film which is easy to see as David is an early model of android, and finally it is plausible that some record of the events in Prometheus ended up in the Company's computers because in Alien the Engineer ship's beacon only gave a warning so the Company could not have known what if any organisms would be available for collection.  The Prometheus expedition would have provided some inkling.

With these elements left in the script much of the rest of the film becomes very confusing.  For instance, if the Engineers created mankind and later decided to destroy them; the pathogen incased in cylinders that apparently is capable of jumpstarting an evolutionary cycle that culminates in the Xenomorph does not gel with the cargo hold full of eggs in the original Alien movie.  It would have made more sense for their to be eggs rather than cylinders in Prometheus.  Or at least it would have made sense for the cylinders to somehow transform into eggs when disturbed or something like that because then they could be seen as some sort of experimental precursor to the eggs.  This is problematic, though, because while the Nostromo's discovery of the Engineer ship on LV-426 came after the events in Prometheus it has been suggested in other Alien Franchise media that the ship on LV-426 may have been there for many millennia: even before the events in Prometheus.  All this confusion is what happens when you make a prequel that is not a prequel but yet is still a prequel.",1519084800,,2130,4.747967479674797

4740973,5,B005LAIHY0,"[Forgive my English, I am on touch screen and not natively English. I tried to be vague as to give no spoilers.
First: The Prequel Is indirect, And Has A Focus On Characters, It is not Another Alien Film, But More So we See Hints Of What May Have Happened, But Are Left With A Large Gap To Keep Our Minds From Having The Xeno Ruined For Us....I Had To Watch This Movie A few Times Showing Friends, Enjoying The Actors fantastic jobs as the characters, So It Grew On Me After theaters,at First, I Wanted An Alien Film, Not An ""indirect"".... I Now love It And Think Its A Wonderful Film, I Am Glad It Is An Indirect Prequel, This Does Not Ruin The Alien Films By Focus Of Character And Remaining Rather Indirect, to Not Ruin What a Simple But Fantastic And Wonderful Film Alien Was..., I Used To Only Think Noomi Rapace And The Guy Who Played David Had Any Chemistry (Granted They Just Happen To Work Well Together) I Feel Bad That i Under Rated This Movie Going In. I Was Wrong, It Just Took Me About 3 Times and Focusing On The Characters I Did Like First Viewing, I Have A BluRay And dvd Copy, Both Play Well ,Include Extras Etc. I suggest watching extras, as in theater the alternative Holloway and Shaw scene of drunkenness on DVD was the scene (worst Version, I Cannot Post Spoiler So I Hope That is Good Enough)) in my theater viewing. I am not sure why the scene I Saw Theatrical Is Now ""Alternate"" On DVD,  Of Course ,Some Scene Were Ooc Of The Shaw Character, But The Engineer Shaw Shoukd Been Full Scene And Fifield Alt One Too Were WAY Better In My Opinion.
There is Some Interesting Commentary And Nice Extras.

I Am Buying A Second Copy Just For digital and to give the credit it Is Lacking As Teens Have Suddenly Become Interested In The franchise( In david Vecause He Became Famous A Few Years Later So They Follow The Actor), But Many Have Only Seen The Newest One And They Do Not Like Old School Fans, and Bash every Other Movie In The Franchise ,They Will Attempt To Bully You Away From Something You likely have Action Figures Of Alien Older Than They ARE. So Hence My Reason For Finally Realizing The Importance to Leave A Review And Praise Its Actually Good or Even Godly By Compare It To The POS New Abortion... Had Scott Just Written It And Continued Filming What He Originally Planned Wouldnt Be dealing With This.

The Prequel Is Indirectand Focuses More On Characters Than, Being A Horror Film, Noomi Rapace is Amazing, The Character She Plays Is The Main Female, She is Lovely Even Though They Tried Dulling Her Appearance, Perhaps To Look A Good Christian Girl? It Failed, As Even Uglied Up She Is Gorgeous. If You Are A Fan Of Noomi You Will Love Her performance And Her Chemistry With The Actor who plays David, not that its bad with anyone, but those 2 are fantastic together in these roles!!, from serious to light hearted moments, her Character Is Brains, And Faith, with a kind heart as you will see many moments rather than getting angry, she understands that the synthetic does not understand, at worst is annoyed, she is seemingly troubled and suffers from PTSD from childhood and the effects abusive people Around Her, but her character remains kind. She is stubborn and determined to boot. Far From Ripley who is willing to take quarantine seriously.and is kind of familiar enough with weapons and such to be the badass we know And Love <3.
The different characters were great, including the supporting cast, Charlize Theron was fantastic, I hate the character she played the part very well, The pilot played by Elba(sp?) Was a character you wish you got a few more scenes with To Learn More Of Him, Hated Whoever Played Holloway As holloway, He Did A Good Job At Being Someone you Can Just Tell Is Shadier Than He Says By What He Says, Acts, Does. I Found The Actors Even Minir Supporting Roles To All Be Fantastic, And Of Coyrse guy Did Not Disappoint In His Role Either!
 It Was Nice To See Something Indirect And With A Different Lead Female Type, And A Very Human Synth (Who until Production Was Stopped In The Original Sequel I do Not Think Was Intended To Be Evil And Would Love To See Those Sequels Instead)) #BringBackShaw #FixDavid
Sorry i Ramble Due To Sadly Meeting new Fans, And I Have Been Constantly Interrupted trying To Type This, But LIfe And Work Call. I have not slept in 3 days because insomnia abd adulting are incompatible, forgive if i repeat or make typos worse than my bad english...And I Will Be Honest The More Angry I Get At covenant, (which Is Easy To Do As i Cannot Seem To Escape the Occasional New fan Ever Hateful, Especially Of The Most Beautiful Main And Anything That Isnt Politically correct,SJWed Or Sensitized Because All Movies Before 2017 Offend Them By Existing,( And god D*mn Does Prometheus Having An exotically Beautiful Lead Trigger Crazies!), Wanting A Customized Doll, Commissioned, I Would Avoid It If i Did Not Have ""Action Bills!"")) The More I Regret Not Putting a review Up After Theater Viewing, Or After Showing It to A Couple Friends and It Growing On Me As A Distant Prequel.

a Warning About Alien Covenant which i refer to as an abortion, they have what seems to be someones really bad alien fan fic they wrote as a tween complete with a really crappy ripley clone OC,(just Like Bad Fan Fic Voice Chat Readings In The 90s XD) A Fic that They updated But Not Much, And Took Advantage of Scott Being Elderly To Get that Awful Thing Out....So if that thought bothers you proceed to the alleged sequel with Caution, Be Prepared To See On Screen Every Sh*tty Alien fic You Stumbled Accross Back In The Day On screen Lol
Tell Scott Its A Joke He Claims To Wabt To Hear From His Real Fans Who Bareky Come Online But Alk Have Caereers And Make 6 Fugures Abd are the ones Who Have Money...A:C it is not indirect and makes even existing characters From This Film A Pathetic Version Of Who They Were In The POS Which He Seems To Now Regret, Just A Warning To Anyone Who Appreciated This Being A Character Focused Indirect prequel, Covenant However...Damn thing needs to be ""Highlander 2"" ed... and ""Renegaded"" And Glossed Over. C
Now If You Hated This you might like it, though in more cases than not even Prometheus haters took a second look and find it to be a good movie in comparison even with a bias. So good luck if that is your next stop, its dangerous to go go aone, take a copy of Aliens with you and hold it tight..

Ok, this been killing me for years, artificial gravity??? Impossible, just a studio convenience, because building a set portraying a ship using centrifugal force for gravity would be too costly. Star Trek 1967 set the pattern for all sci-fi since.",1514592000,,800,4.7214285714285715

It's more philosophical than the other movies. The action and horror are there, but only in the last third or so of the film. The aesthetic is also different- less claustrophobic eighties industrial-techno geek, more wide vistas with clean lines and atmospheric music.

Does prequel have to mean incredibility? It has a veneer of coherent Sci Fi that rapidly wears off as the film progresses. Then silliness takes over. Then gore and shock tactics. The Fassbender robot character is obnoxious from start to finish - quite unlike the Lance Henriksen incarnation of the best of the Alien films....the one directed by James Cameron.

As a gesture towards feminine resource and durability (and Hollywood seems to be turning out to be quite a commando course for most young women, given the recent sexual abuse revelations) Rapace puts in an astounding performance. But it's a gesture like everything else in this movie marred by grotesquely repulsive scenes.

Some young L.A. team has dreamt this up in a brainstorming session, I dare say the whiteboard and marker pens swapped for video conferencing, culled from as many workable (= commercial) populist movie codes and elements they could get to stick together. The squeaky joints show. I have seen more professional 16mm fringe films.

Charlize looks great and I thought the cast was decent, especially that of Dr. Shaw. Very nice.
However, some of what the so called ""scientists"" did once arriving on the ""alien"" planet was ridiculous. I don't care if the air is breathable in a part of the structure they were in, you never remove your helmet that has air filters, etc. to protect you from airborne bacteria, etc.
Then, they go into this other part of the structure where these LARGE alien humanoids are all laying about, dead, and find metallic pods that house a black unknown substance. They bring the robot along, David, that was created by Mr. Weyland himself. Bad idea. The Scientists don't really know what David has inside of his programming. So, while a large ""storm"" approaches the structure, the members find themselves racing back to the PROMETHEUS to escape the storm's dangerous impact. When the members aren't looking, David ""bags"" one of the pods housing unknown contagion, etc. and brings it back onto the ship via the lift gate that was down to let the fleeing members back in. His safety protocols, if he had any to begin with, are all thrown out the window, so to speak, so he can see this thing up close and examine it for himself.
Basically, the pods are filled with biological weaponry the ""BIG Humanoids"" made. But, what happens when one ""injests"" such liquid?
That's THE Question David wants answered for himself. The crew ends up fighting for their very lives after several members are infected and must find out if the Scientist's ""creators"" theory of the BIG Humanoids holds up or fades away into oblivion.

It starts as a sense of wonder exploration film, but it becomes mainly a monster in a cave film. Yet it seems to hold together, especially when the deleted scenes are included, then it makes more senses. The crew of the Prometheus are a mixture of idealists and cynics. Elizabeth Shaw is an idealist and even Mr. Weyland is an idealist, each seeking ultimate answers as to why the human race exists. Ultimately they find the Elder Gods/Old Ones to be hostile to humans, The Elder Gods died out 2000 years ago, just as they were about to deliver their arsenal of biological weapons [the Alien creatures of previous movies] upon us poor failed humans. Why is not known. But the idea of a hostile universe of hostile creators is older than H.P. Lovecraft, who wrote extensively on the subject. It is still not clear why Vickers really came along, perhaps to mock Weyland. Though a scientific expedition, the voyage to the Alien planet is also a religious quest to find ultimate answers. The answer is death, not enlightenment. A good film, well-worth seeing. Not as gory as expected and an improvement over Alien Resurrection, which I did not like.",1505779200,3,1267,4.58590308370044

synthetic looks on with glee as all die save one. However, it does have plenty of CGI eye candy and ridiculous
stunts, so it's perfect for millennials and undiscerning foreign markets.

Sure questions were answered, but the script was so ridiculously disjointed that this could have
been done in post credits scenes. It was almost as if they forget until the end of the writing process
and just slapped the revelatory scenes on top. . .

Note to Ridley Scott. What made the original so good was it's 2001 steel cold austerity. None of the characters
were chest thumping as the greatest intellects of all time or the baddest of the bad. There were no sappy
love interests. The characters were believable and the acting was solid enough to make them even more so.

I was hoping that by watching Prometheus, it would answer all the questions that the piss-poor Alien Covenant film left unanswered or unaddressed, like - who the Engineers were.  But no.  Prometheus was actually more confusing and full of plot holes than Alien Covenant.  How the idiotic space crew characters ever qualified for a space exploration mission is one of the most confounding aspects of both films. And to make matters more confusing, it's entirely unclear why the aging billionaire benefactor, who funds the space mission, is involved, other than to seek some life-sustaining/fountain-of-youth miracle.  But there is absolutely NO  established premise that any life-extending formula is out there, or that this was what the crew was seeking.  Mission classified? Indeterminate?  How do you get a qualified crew if they don't know what they're supposed to be doing or looking for?  If there was an explanation, it was lost in the lame script and glossed over in favor of lots of gore and guts scenes. These sci-fi-horror films cannot garner any respectability when they're just slapped together without any valid, scientifically-based, plot ""glue"" to support how events unfold.  This would have been soooo much better and interesting if the script had maintained a sole focus on the android's motivations and his ill-defined relationship with the Engineers and the Aliens.  In the end, it tries to imply too much information through ambiguous visuals, but provides no intelligent dialog to back it up.

Watching ""Covenant"" first, I felt I was missing information. Now watching this I was able to piece most of the story together and how the Xenomorph creatures came to be. Like all the movies in the series, it starts off slow, and then turns into an action filled bloody nightmare. I really like the writer's perspective on the concept of human/alien/artificial evolution and it's purpose. The Xenomorphs have haunted my dreams since I was 7 years old, and watching this movie still sparked that inner fear of those creatures. I need to stop watching these movies alone at night. Another sci fi series that really questions about the creation of androids and why I feel it's a bad idea! As a fan of the ""Alien "" series, I am glad to have this movie in my collection.

I saw only one of the Alien films many years ago, so I probably wouldn't recognize any tie-ins.  I purchased the UHD version since there's not a lot of material available that makes use of the new TV and player I purchased.  There are some excellent scenery shots early in the moving that make good use of the UHD format, and also some excellent special effects throughout.  But to me the plot is a confused mess.  They take big jumps in time between many of the early scenes, the reason(s) the aliens act as they do is not at all clear (perhaps deliberately to set the stage for sequels), the humans take wild guesses about the aliens which are never really confirmed or refuted, and the plot feels like it starts in the middle and ends in the middle without much resolution.  There is not much character development either.  This is basically an action and special effects movie, so if that's what you like, you will probably be satisfied.

4742633,3,B005LAIHY0,"I can't decide if this movie is an example of frightening/good or horrifically bad sci-fi.

Balance sheet for good:
* good special effects
* interesting concept regarding origin of humanity

Balance sheet for bad:
* every single character, perhaps with the exception of Vickers (Theron), who is flawed in her own way, is a complete idiot and should never be allowed near matches much less any piece of machinery or a starship, ever. Everyone is utterly devoid of common sense or basic scientific precautions or skills, resulting in constant (wearying, predictably) catastrophic actions not even thoughtful enough to be called decisions. This results in a relentlessly frustrating & wholly predictable plot. It just made me tired, and sick of both scientists and humans in general.

So at first I thought that this movie was one of the worst ever made. But on further reflection, here's the rub: that bad side of the balance sheet might just be a realistic take on the ultimate hubris of humans. Every stupid choice made, if viewed through the lens of human arrogance, makes a ridiculous, self-destructive kind of sense. Of COURSE we should take our helmets off before we have more information than mere oxygen levels. Of COURSE we should bring mercenaries (actually called that in the script) that are dumber than dirt and can't stick with the group. Of COURSE we have a hot captain who can't seem to follow what is happening on the ground, despite all kinds of cool tracking technology. Of COURSE, in the first 6 hours on a new planet, a stupid scientist has to risk the whole mission for a head that, since immediately & easily found, would likely have an equivalent find the next day.

The relentless stupidity just goes on. But the sad, depressing, awful thing is, it's plausible. Humans are unbelievably arrogant and stupid. And it's not a stretch to think that all the annoying, frustrating actions (again, barely qualifying as choices or decisions with these awful characters) would, and could, actually happen. So either this movie just sucks, or it's a pretty ugly but stunningly realistic mirror of humans and one possible outcome of our space exploration if we can't somehow curb our insane arrogance and hubris into some form of humility, self-reflection and caution.

Since I have no idea if Ridley Scott made this movie thinking it was authentically good sci-fi, or made it as an ironic reflection on humanity's hubris (miss you, Stanley Kubrick) I can only give it 3 stars and split the difference.",1500249600,2,2513,4.93144208037825

This was a hard sci fi with original and philosophical ideas. Ridley Scott made the film he wanted to, yet it wasn't easily accessible by the general public. Flash forward a few years, and the studio forced it's hand by shoehorning ""Alien"" into the mix. The result we got was Alien Covenent. Yet the audience still didn't show up, and at the end we got a bad sequel with a identity crisis.

4743033,2,B005LAIHY0,"I can remember when the trailers were playing constantly on tv and in the movie theaters and from all that I saw and from hearing that this was to be a prequel in the Alien franchise plus Ridley Scott was back in the director's chair of this series for the first time since Alien back in 1979, I was filled with excitement and elation.  Well once I saw this movie in theaters, every single one of my hopes for this movie were totally shattered to pieces within a very short period of time.  I even gave this pos a second chance when I rented just recently after seeing Alien Covenant and still in 5 years passed nothing about this movie has improved in the slightest bit.

This train-wreck has very little to offer.  While I was blown away by the great set designs, special effects, visuals overall, beautifully breath-taking cinematography, and the gorgeous and atmospheric score, unfortunately nothing about this movie boasted entertaining, fun, or exciting.

Let's start with the characters:
-Very few of them knew one another previously before being awakened from their cryo-sleeps
-Not much info is offered in regards to what the jobs are for most of the people on the ship.
-They are all totally dull and one-dimensional nothings that are just plain forgettable.
-As these characters aren't developed to any great degree, it is impossible to care about a single one of them much less if they survive.
-Charlize Theron's character Meredith Vickers is highly irritating, seriously obnoxious and contemptible, totally worthless, plus she is more acid-tongued than any Xenomorph could ever be.  LOL
-The cyborg David is well enough played by Michael Fassbender but his agendas are at times really wrong and without any clarity as to why he does them.  If man created him then how does he sometimes think for himself?
-Sexy and gorgeous actress Noomi Rapace did a fine enough job as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw but as she becomes the focal point later in the movie she especially should have been a far better developed character than she turns out being.
-Peter Weyland played by Guy Pearce was not only the most underdeveloped character, but the makeup was just ridiculous as not only did he look like a rotting squash but he also gives you an idea of what it would be like if Gary Oldman were in really cheap makeup intended to look like Emperor Palpatine.
-As for the rest, well there just isn't anything about them that stands out even in the littlest bit that those characters did.
-Sadly not only weren't any of the characters well enough developed, but they weren't funny or cool or interesting in any possible respect of the word.

I don't have much to say about the script other than the dialogue stemming from it was too bland and ordinary.  No catch-phrases, no signature lines or moments for any of the characters, no humor, as I mentioned, just nothing to note about the writing other than it was very pedestrian at best.

Other than one of the crew becoming a homicidal creature and them having to kill him there are no action scenes at all.

There were some really disturbing scenes in the movie that would've been better off either done differently or not at all. The scene where Vickers torches one of the crew members due to his having a nasty alien virus in him, was one unpleasantly disturbing scene.  The alien abortion scene was both unacceptably sickening but also just plain grutuitous in both how much detail was shown plus that it happens in the movie to begin with.  Other than that the snake-like alien and the bigger snake-like alien with the nasty tentacles and tendrals plus the teeth in a sickening part of it's body actually raping their victims was absolutely too much.  All of those scenes were disturbing, offensive, darkly toned, and felt way too exploitative in nature.  Considering how mostly devoid of such sick and vomit-inducing scenes that Alien was,(to where if something gross or shocking happened there was a warranted rationale for it) what made Ridley decide to use that nastiness in this movie?

The plot isn't interesting at all nor was it well thought out.  Not only is it gutsy that Ridley Scott would want to touch upon a controversial issue such as who made us to attempt to do so in a much less religious-based manner, but this whole premise of the crew of the Prometheus being sent to embark on a journey to go to a strange planet to find answers to who created humanity believing the aliens known as the Engineers to have done so, is nothing but a dull and completely stupid premise in which I fail to see how any of this has anything to do with a single element of the Alien series.

There is very little reason to feel terribly invested in the character Dr. Elizabeth Shaw as she is more focused on when the movie is down to the last 40 minutes to where her survival only matters for the good of humanity and also because she proves one tough survivor of so much.  My point is she should have been more focused on throughout the course of the movie the way that Ripley was in Alien, giving the audience every reason to care about Ripley's survival.

What we come to know about the mysterious ""Space Jockey' is one bland letdown.  Enough said there.

The pacing of this movie is painfully slow offering no rewarding pay-off in the end.  In all of those slow scenes nothing scary or tragic happens until 62 minutes into the movie.  Even after that point the pacing never speeds up once and to make matters worse, all of that time that they spend on that planet just keeps the movie from moving forward the way that it should.  There was literally nothing particularly scary in this movie that lasts for any real time.

All in all, if you're a big fan of only some of the Alien series or all 4 movies then the likelihood that you would get anything from this turkey is not all that great.  It's totally humorless/takes itself way too seriously, the plot is dull and worthless, the characters are all flat as a crepe, the script is boring boasting no catchphrases or anything memorable said, the pace is much too slow and mostly stagnant, there are scenes that are gratuotously sick and disturbing, it's just boring in every possible way,  there are far more characters in it than are really needed, there's no character to really care about, there's very little action,  the one action scene that there is only lasts for 2 minutes, Charlize Theron is annoying in this movie and her character is a total ignoramous, the aliens in this movie are either violent brutes or rapists, finally the connection between this and Alien only vaguely shows at the end of the movie.  A definite must skip!  2 stars out of 10!",1497225600,2,6659,4.641702127659575

The plot includes an unexplained break -- the first 2 members of an exploratory expedition who left to return to the ship (they left long before the others) somehow got stuck at the site being explored after the others returned to the ship.  The special effects were good and the acting was good -- but the over-all plot seems pretty random.

I disagree with those reviews and I found the acting to be engaging and very true-to-life (normal). Not everyone is a Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Meryl Streep or Julia Roberts, but that DOESN'T mean that all the rest are bad actors.

The first ""Alien"" movie, as well as the second ""Aliens"", and possibly even the third were pretty good. The 4th ""Alien Resurrection"" pretty much sucked.

Yet, instead of producing something new that hasn't been beaten to death, you decide to retread ""Alien"" - and do it really poorly?

Shame on you Ridley Scott.

Enough other reviewers have pointed out how nonsensical this movie is, how the actions of the characters are illogical, how the various aliens are laughable, and how the plot is so disjointed that it makes very little sense.

I saw this movie on the heels of ""Alien: Covenant""  (which, IMHO, isn't much better) Hoping it would explain it. Well, it explained it, but opened a whole 'nuther can of stinky alien worms.

One movie on a given theme can be great. Two can be good, three - if the producer is very lucky - can be passable. But 4, 5, 6 (and guessing 7?) Absolutely detract from the first trilogy.

The main question, and which still remains unanswered after seeing the sequel ""Alien Covenant""  is why did The Engineers want to destroy their own creation, human kind. Theorize that Scott wants it that way to maintain discussion and to encourage seeing subsequent sequels, cannot decide, or the writers and directors and Scott cannot agree.

Look at the pedigree, cast, crew and budget and it looks like it couldn't lose but the best I can say is it's OK but meh, could have been so much better considering everything involved.

I like the original Alien movie but can't say the space-horror genre is my favorite type of Sci-Fi (although Sci-Fi is my favorite genre). It's a well crafted popcorn flick that feels like they cut half of the plot out of it. The plot continuity is terrible. All this money and decades to think up a worthy successor to the original Alien movie and the story we end up with is weak. Every possible trope was crammed in there as if they were ingredients yet no one tasted the final product, or if they did, they cut so much out of it that the plot doesn't make any sense. It looks like multiple different people worked on different parts of the movie then someone just stuck them all together.

Spoilers - the guy who funded the mission of the spaceship Prometheus spent a trillion dollars on a gamble that these giant aliens, who the hero determined had visited Earth thousands of years ago, would somehow cure him of old age. The old trillionaire's android infects one of the scientists who then impregnates the hero with an almost instant growing alien baby seed. She gives herself a gory c-section after these inhuman crew members let her escape but then a half hour later she's walking around the spaceship as if no one just tried to kill her and there was no risk of biological contamination to the old man. Apparently they knew the alien seed wasn't carried by air and yet they couldn't predict the other (human ancestor) alien they woke up would just try to kill them instead of extending the life of an old man who couldn't even speak his language.

Everyone you expect to die does but it's not some juicy revenge death karma for them being despicable they just die one after another by the numbers. We get to see graphic gore and blood but no boobies because people are even more repressed in the future, they have to wear bandages over their boobs haha!

Honestly, rent the tv show The Expanse if you like this type of thing but with a story. Maybe it's not possible to tell a good story in a couple of hours anymore regardless of how much money you put into making it.",1495929600,,2375,4.4279176201373

4743584,3,B005LAIHY0,"This line, spoken by David, could also be said about Prometheus.  In a sense, Scott is destroying the relatively simple Alien film in order to create something similar but also entirely new.

I saw this in theaters when it came out, and was disappointed.  I watched it again before watching Alien: Covenant (which I still recommend people do if they are interested in seeing Alien: Covenant because it is essentially Prometheus 2).

This film is completely plot-driven, meaning character is sacrificed in order to move the plot forward.  The characters make ridiculous decisions because, if they acted rationally, there would be no movie.  Unlike other entries in the Alien franchise, there is zero tension as the film moves from one set piece to the next at breakneck speed.  It is a convoluted mess of a story.

The acting is top-notch, and the effects aren't bad.  Much like Fassbender's David, this film has great surface level appeal, but there's no heart or soul.  Having seen Alien: Covenant, and enjoyed it, I can say that, for me, this is the weakest film in the Alien franchise, and the only one that I probably will never buy other than to complete my collection.  That kind of depends on the strength of Covenant's inevitable sequel.

4743632,3,B005LAIHY0,"Great movie, but beware the propaganda.  Here's a scene in the movie where they talk about the atmosphere of the planet that are about to explore,  and one of the ""scientists"" claims ""its like breathing through an exhaust pipe, the atmosphere is 3% CO2!""  This statement of course is not accidental...it's Hollywood's method of brainwashing people into believing that CO2 is deadly.  You know, the same gas that is essential for life on this planet, and without which all life would perish.  The same gas that plants breathe.  Never mind that it is carbon MONOXIDE, not carbon dioxide,  from a car's exhaust that kills you (carbon monoxide binds with the hemoglobin molecules in our blood, preventing Oxygen from binding).  Also, they also erroneously claim that a 3% CO2 level will kill you.  This is false...levels would have to be twice that amount to kill (6%).  Here's the math for those that really car about the truth and not leftist propaganda (the flat earth people):

 In medical sciences 1 atmosphere, i.e. the pressure of the air at the sea level is expressed as 760 millimetres of mercury, 760 mm Hg. So, if we assume that the air consist of 78% N2, 21% of O2 and 0.04% of CO2 then each of the three molecules exerts the following pressure:
N2: (78/100)*760 = 593 mm Hg
O2: (21/100)*760 = 160 mm Hg
CO2: (0.04/100)*760 = 0.3 mm Hg
Now we need to make connection between the partial pressure of CO2 in the air and in the blood, before breathing in and after breathing out. For the gas molecule to cross from the lungs to the blood it needs to have the higher partial pressure in the lungs than in the blood, and obviously, the opposite is true  if the partial pressure of the gas molecule is higher in the blood than in the lungs, it will cross from the blood to the lungs. When it comes to CO2, its concentration in the blood, after the blood has collected all the CO2 generated by the bio-chemical process keeping the cells alive reaches the pressure of 45 mm Hg, while the pressure inside the lungs after we breathe in the air is 0.3 mm Hg.
Therefore, as long as the partial pressure of CO2 in the air that we breathe in is less than 45 mmHg, the human body will be able to clear out the cell-produced CO2. By the way, when people suffer serious brain damage which affects breathing, the function of those machines that maintain the life is to bring in the oxygen and make sure that all the CO2 is cleared from the blood stream.
The number to watch for is 45 mm Hg of CO2 in the air, or 6% or 60,000 PPM  that is the concentration of CO2 that needs to be reached for the humankind to become extinct. If my math is serving me right, if we divide 60,000 PPM with 400 PPM we get the kill factor for CO2: 150.
In other words, the concentration of CO2 needs to increase 150-fold for the CO2 to become toxic.
Bearing in mind that all those mathematicians and paleo-something scientists do not have a clue about the real capacity of the CO2 sinks, like the water and the biomass (more about it in the next report) I reckon that we are perfectly safe for a long, long time and should celebrate CO2 as a gas of life. If it was not for CO2, we would not be discussing it today.",1495238400,,3182,4.380305602716469

4743637,4,B005LAIHY0,"Watched this before going to see Covenant, having only seen it once and pretty much disliking it. I was surprised how much better it was the second time around. When I realized this this new direction was David's story, the story makes more sense. Fassbender's performance was the one thing I liked the first time, and re-watching it only deepens my appreciation for his skill at acting. If only the other characters had half as much nuance. Noomi Rapace does an excellent job with her material, and hits home runs during certain queasy moments, but her character isn't exactly all that bright when it comes to self-preservation. The rest of the cast is pretty much wasted, unfortunately.

The design and special effects are truly excellent, setting a bar for the look and feel of future sci-fi films. If you can ignore some of the non-essential mumbo jumbo the writers inserted to try to produce a 'thinking' script, this film works well. I saw a basic premise that told a simple story the second time, which made the movie much more palatable then when I was trying to figure out the uneven mythology the writers were trying to produce. The key is focusing on David as the main character, and everything else fell in place for me.

I bought this steaming pile of a film because I have always enjoyed Ridley Scott's style.  But this film is so very bad it's almost not worth criticizing.

Five minutes of action packed into two very long, tedious hours.  Miserable acting. Confusing, dull, very unnatural dialogue.  Cheezy accents.  The characters are so flat and uninteresting there is absolutely no reason to like or care or hate any of them.  All the actors and actresses (I am being generous in calling them that) seemed to have met approximately three minutes before filming began.  Cherlize Theron should be singled out for special punishment here.

The special effects were decent, but, in the end, they were so much sound and fury signifying absolutely nothing. Claustrophobic sets.  The plot is so very dreary and predictable that we know how the story ends fifteen minutes after it begins.  The entire movie is one giant clich&eacute;.

I guess it popped up on my radar given the new Alien: Covenant film is set to release any day now. I really enjoyed this film and it opened up a whole new realm of depth to the Alien saga without really giving itself to being a prequel to that story. There was a lot left unanswered and certain things were a mystery. I hopped online afterwards to read more about the plot line and where this film may go, as the ending certainly eluded to a sequel (or more). I found some interesting theories and hypotheses but nothing solid. Also, some were criticizing the acting and poor development of the characters, etc. This may be true but to me there still seemed much this film offered. Furthermore, it would seem that Ridley Scott has given much heed to the opinions of his fans to bring back the xenomorph of Alien as many were disappointed with this film not following that line. I certainly hope he (Scott) gives further consideration to expanding the Prometheus storyline as there is so much potential for continuation. To know where Noomi Rapace's character goes after she leaves the moon and what clarifications could be given, there is much that can be redeemed from this film.

I hear that Alien: Covenant will feature the Engineers from the Prometheus film but I certainly hope he doesn't stop there in telling more this story. I guess we'll see here at the cinema in a few days...

I posted the 20 minute video on YouTube saying there were only 20 minutes of usable material in the movie. YouTube pulled it down claiming copyright infringement. Oh well.

Sometimes answers that you seek simply don't exist.  Other times the answers kill you in very nasty ways.  Other times you find an answer but you still don't understand it, because as humans there are some things that are beyond us.  Why is the ""truth"" always going to be uplifting and positive, instead of nasty deadly and deeply sarcastic.  I wanted to slap the Shaw character often and hard.  I love the alien series (well the first two anyway).  This followed the same formula as the ones before, but in this case their stupidity made it actually hard to be sympathetic.

OK, great.  It's now very mysterious in that it doesn't make any sense.  The visuals are quite nice, yes, and the spaceship is beautiful, but the story makes no sense.  This gives it the feel of X-Files, where nursing the mystery is the whole point, and no one expects everything to fit together.  Even the ""black oil"" seems ripped from X-Files. People in this movie do things that make no sense.  It's jarring.  Such a far cry from Alien and Aliens where you had a tight action-reaction driving the plot.

(A quick side-note:Why it took 20th Century Fox so long to allow Ridley to make another film in the Alien universe is beyond me.) Anyhow, the Blu-Ray version of Prometheus is the best version to view, as we have deleted/extended scenes that help to give the audience a better understanding of the characters' motivations. Also, the picture looks beautiful! Speaking of a beautiful picture, the one thing that really got me was the visuals in this film, particularly the scene in which the Prometheus lands on LV-223. I smile real big when I see that scene!! Sure, the movie's not perfect, as the ideas introduced about the creation of humankind by the Engineers'/Space Jockeys will need at least one or two more films to iron out all of the details. However, I'm not sure that the upcoming Alien: Covenant is going to do all that much to help answer the questions. But, I digress....Anyhow, Prometheus is a solid sci-fi thriller/horror that delivers the goods!

4744494,5,B005LAIHY0,"There are basically only two characters in this film that matter; the scientist Elizabeth Shaw and David, the very self aware android who is capable of independent thought and action and also possesses genuine human feelings and emotions.

All other characters are vehicles for providing convenient subplots that tie into the lives of the 2 main characters.
Reviewing this film blow by blow could easily be derailed and turn into a book report rather than a meaningful review so we'll just fast forward.

In short, the interaction between Elizabeth Shaw, David and the other crew members provide all the entertainment value of the film.

The aesthetic components of H.R. Giger dominate the film naturally, but they also provide a solid basis for the appearance of the aliens and their technology which is only hinted at in the previous Alien films. In this prequel, this concept is expanded upon to a much larger degree that is both impressive; to say the least, as it is terrifying.

Another welcome refinement are the scenes that provide definitive clarity about the life cycle of the hideous creatures, which does not exclusively include parasitic replication within a host life form; they did have to evolve from somewhere after all.

The depictions of the android David are most revealing, with a decidedly menacing quality as we later see.
His struggle to define and understand his own personae are quite interesting; especially the scenes where he's watching and emulating the Peter O'Toole character from the film Lawrence of Arabia and when he is insulted by the abrasive condescension of Charlie Holloway and after some verbal fencing between the two characters, David secretly puts a drop of ""alien"" DNA into Holloway's drink; the results of which are decidedly regrettable.

Overall the production values are breathtaking. All the technical aspects of a film of this magnitude appear to be perfect to the layman's eyes as only an industry professional specializing in CG effects would recognize any flaws.
The depiction of the breeding beds of the parasitic alien creatures are convincingly repulsive and frightening.

The holographic imaging provide an enjoyable added dimension for the viewer and helps to substantiate and clarify certain technical aspects of the film.
Noomi Rapace delivers an outstanding performance as Elizabeth Shaw; a performance that must have been as physically and emotionally draining for her as much as it was stressful for the viewer.

All in all, this is an outstanding film that successfully meshes all the qualities of technical perfection, excellent casting as well as a truly intelligent script that achieves a level of conceptual realization that is rare in the field of the cinematic arts.",1488585600,,2738,5.192743764172335

A review in Forbes said it best, ""What was touted as the next genre-defining sci-fi masterpiece is instead a completely unoriginal mash-up of other movies, and the architects of the film seem to think that we are too stupid to notice.""

Also, I get irritated with writers who think the idea that life on Earth originated somewhere else is profound. It's actually a pretty empty idea. It explains almost nothing. It simply puts off the explanation of how life originated to some other time and place. And it's not necessary. We already have a fairly good scientific explanation of how life originated here.

But this movie takes that lousy premise and makes it even worse with its lazy and laughably bad storytelling...a nonsensical plot, cheesy dialog, two-dimensional characters, shameless rip offs of other movies. I'm amazed that top professionals in the business were paid big bucks to come up with something as lame as this.

4744567,4,B005LAIHY0,"I wanted to give this movie my highest recommendation but in all honesty I can't. ""Prometheus"" doesn't suffer from a lack of talented people behind and in front of the cameras nor is it diminished by a lack of visual flair. On the contrary; the cast is a top notch ensemble, the designs and visual effects are state of the art and Ridley Scott is a renowned visual stylist. ""Prometheus"" is hindered by the same malady that affects many other blockbuster movies: a good premise that fails to be told as a good story. A movie lacking in good storytelling and relatable characters is reduced to visual set pieces that thrill the audience but doesn't involve them in the drama of the story. If ""Prometheus"" was intended to be the first in a series of films it stands to reason that not every question raised will be answered and even in the revelation of answers new questions are raised. Where ""Prometheus"" goes wrong is that there is too much left unanswered and it results in a movie which ends but doesn't come to a point. This is poor storytelling and no amount of visual flair can cover it up. My critique isn't meant to pillory the filmmakers or to leave you the impression that this is a terrible movie. ""Prometheus"" is by no means a ""bad"" movie but it fails to deliver on it's promise but failing to turn a good premise into an equally good story well told.",1486944000,5,1362,4.473895582329317

4744639,5,B005LAIHY0,This movie was very mind blowing! It a long movie but worth every minute of watching.

4744640,4,B005LAIHY0,"Okay, so there is a lot to be frustrated about in this title. For one, there are too many different themes and threads that don't quite seem to cohere with one another, and why they've been introduced into the Alien mythos often seems baffling. For instance: that overt questions about the meaning (and origins) of life are the major driving motivations of the entire mission of the Prometheus seems to cast a quizzical spell on the entire experience of the film.  This is especially so in light of the basic plot structure of every previous installment: i.e., life is going normally, the alien(s) show up to disrupt this, the alien(s) are conquered at great sacrifice, and life resumes its normalcy. While it is hard not to appreciate the attempt to illuminate the Engineer creature originally presented in the first film, the fantastical panspermistic explanation of the origin of life on earth that comes of this is a bit hard to swallow, as the biologist character Milburn even offers, ironically enough, within the dialogue of the film. ""If you're willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism . . ."" The gloss of ""faith vs. reason"" in the film seems equally flimsy. Shaw's initial dialogue with her father about the afterlife, and his hollow explanation, i.e., ""it's what I choose to believe. What do you believe?"" all seems a bit too easily won. To put it succinctly: in terms of thematic ambition, the script and its writer bite of far more than they can chew. Some other difficulties include how Shaw's baby magically grows many times its size in isolation, the ease with which we can identify the mealworm props as mealworms prior to their transformation into hammerpedes, and a number of other things that will pull the perceptive viewer out of suspension of disbelief.

That having been said, there is a LOT to like, especially on multiple viewings. Fassbender as the android David is the real star of the show, in terms of a compelling character -- his entire demeanor, along with the moral ambiguity of his behavior, is masterfully executed, in terms of both writing and acting. Rapace is whiny and annoying by comparison. The ""black goo"" substance is an awesome and flexible plot device, and the fact that the Engineers ultimately had a nihilistic agenda in their desire to destroy all life on earth with their engineered weapon, which ultimately turned on them, lends an eerie sense of horror towards the end of the film that is the hallmark of any great tragedy. Couple that with some very laid back, believable comic relief in the more no-nonsense characters like Fifield and Janek, some epic, visceral, beautifully choreographed action scenes, and a lot of other gems, and yeah. It's hard to let its shortcomings outweigh its appeal.",1485820800,5,2755,4.897216274089936

There was a youtube video that hit the nail on the head in that regard; however, I'm willing to concede that maybe the next movie will reveal why the character acted the way he did.

One thing I'm gonna mention because it kind of makes no sense to me about a few things...

1. In Alien 1979 version with Ripley, their ship and ship technology wasn't that ""advanced"". Normal computers and so forth.
2. In Prometheus which if it's the origin story, how does this ship and crew have better gear? Hologram screens and more.

Otherwise very good and cool film. Definitely worth the watch. But like I said above, I'm kind of confused how Prometheus ship and crew have better technology than Ripley's ship and crew did.",1483401600,,757,4.634328358208955

I'm not usually too worried about atheists inserting their ideas into movies but this propaganda is so in your face that it made me ill.

I like parts of ""Aliens"" but ""Alien 3"" is just mindless horror and ""Alien: Resurrection"" isn't really worth considering either. Those movies are all action and no plot. Prometheus is mostly plot with a few gory sci-fi horror scenes, which, honestly, is enough. It would get repetitive otherwise. If all you want to see is a bunch of people dying horrible deaths, well, there are tons of movies like that already.
What makes ""Prometheus"" great is the way it fills in and expands the world of Alien. It also adds this really intriguing backstory and mythology that I had never thought of for the Alien universe. I've watched it probably 15 times. Sure, it has some issues, but the pacing is great, Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is wonderful - you really care about her and admire her by the end - and it is just so damn beautiful. Ridley Scott has a very light touch with the special effects, so they don't feel overpowering.

Prometheus did a decent job explaining the origin of the Xenomorphs and their ""creators"". Escpecialy how they ""evolve"" depending on their host. It also does a great job showing Weyland Corp's involvement with these beings.

4746283,3,B005LAIHY0,"I guess the point of this dark movie--literally and figuratively--is Ridley Scott's Alien Rebirth. The story was difficult to follow. Is it rebellious daughter thwarts rich daddy's plan to achieve eternal life? Is it these giant, almost extinct ""humans"" are God? Or, because of a robot's dismissal of Noomi Rapace's apparent belief in the divinity of Jesus, is it about resurrection, albeit, the resurrection of a kind of master race? You will recognize Noomi Rapace from the foreign movie version of the Stieg Larsson trilogy only a couple of times, and then only when she cocks her eyes in a certain skeptical way. She's gained weight for this picture but is still a tough little gal, especially when she performs a Caesarean on herself. And the rich guy who financed this probe to a distant planet bears a striking resemblance to Noomi's disfigured father in the Millenium trilogy. Lots of excellent special effects. And the movie gave me an urge to visit Iceland.",1473984000,4,967,4.938650306748467

It's been pointed out that the events in this film takes place on a planet (LV-223) that is different from that of the original Alien movie (LV-426) - this I can understand, though it would have answered a number of questions if it had occurred on LV-426, and given a greater degree of fluency for the story arch and flow of events if just two things had transpired.

4747505,3,B005LAIHY0,"This is a difficult film. Some parts are brilliantly crafted and amazing, while others are so crude and ill-fitting that their inclusion seems bizarre. I had been exposed to a few opinions about the movie before watching it, all of which boiled down to ""the characters choose actions which are not believable"", so I had mentally prepared myself somewhat. However, that criticism is completely justified, and hard to escape. A viewer has to suspend disbelief to a degree normally reserved for low-budget horror films. It's not as much suspension of disbelief as it is mentally patching and bailing a sinking ship of belief, on the fly, while the movie is progressing.

That being said, Prometheus is SO close to being an amazing, great movie, and contains so many beautiful and powerful ingredients, that it's absolutely worth watching and thinking about. The visuals, the soundtrack, the atmosphere. Great new creature designs, wonderful alien planets and perfect Giger-esque props. Amazing acting from a lot of the characters, especially Michael Fassbender's performance of David.

I kind of loved this movie, although in a way that seems difficult to translate into a star rating, or even a verbal judgement of ""good"" or ""not good"". Three stars seems decent, generous even, from a critical standpoint, although that seems unfair considering the amount of work by talented and brilliant people that so obviously went into the production.

Anyway, I recommend you watch it if you're at all interested. Be ready to do some mental editing and forgive a lot of flaws, and you'll enjoy everything inbetween them.",1466553600,,1608,5.153256704980843

4747831,3,B005LAIHY0,"A-list actors, a director with a bushel full of great films to his credit, very good special effects, and an interesting premise ought to make for a terrific movie.
Umm, maybe not.
""Prometheus"" has so much going for it that despite a host of bad reviews I took a chance and bought it.
Oh dear, that was a mistake.
Momma always said you should listen to what people say and she was right.
At least about ""Prometheus.""
The problem is that, to be blunt, the writing is really childish.
The actors do the best they can with a juvenile script that reads kind of like ""Jurassic Park"" meets ""Alien"" with an homage to ""The Thing"" thrown in for good measure. The script - especially the dialogue - is, in a word, awful. The writers have turned the movie's characters into caricatures - and not very good ones at that. The scientists are reckless (and arrogant to boot), the ship's captain leaves his post to have sex with a member of the crew (thereby missing an important message from two scientists who are trapped inside a strange alien structure), the science itself is suspect, the ending is trite, and... well, I'd say that the writers need to watch some really good films and (hopefully) learn something about how to put together a script.
So why give it 3 stars?
Well, as I said, the actors do the best they can with what they've been given to work with and the cinematography is decent as are the special effects. As a viewer, it's easy to see where the script goes off track and how, with a good writer or two, it could easily have been a classic.
My plan is to keep it on the shelf with my other movies so that, every now and then, I can look at it and remind myself that sometimes Momma was right.",1465171200,6,1700,4.365930599369086

Which is fine, but the movie never quite becomes as compelling as it should. Or could.

I love the Alien quadrology, and this film was by Ridley Scott.  But I guess he is now well past his prime, because the reality was that the film was garbage, unbelievable actions by the crew, stupidity on a par with All Is Lost.

I kept on wishing that Sigourney Weaver would appear, but no such luck.  Her very presence would have outshone the total presence of everyone else.  This was a terrible film, with no redeeming aspect whatsoever.",1460678400,,897,4.3293413173652695

If you have an open view about man's origin and what was written in discovered old texts or open mind scientists analysis; If you have read: Gilgamesh, The book of Enoch, Chariots of the gods, The Annunaki's, The Watchers, or The Giants,  you will simply LOVE This movie. 7 stars
2. If you have no clue of what i just said above, then you will find many flaws in the movie and probably accept it as an Okay movie. 3 stars
3. My humble opinion; This movie surpasses 2001, or any other science action movie I have ever watched. This movie will become a classic for the next 100 years, mark my words.
Ridley Scott is among the top 5 best movie directors in the world and he does not deceive in Prometheus.

4749495,1,B005LAIHY0,"It is almost inconceivable that this sequel (prequel) was made by the same director when the essence of that first (wonderful and enduring) Alien is so clearly absent. As a standalone science fiction movie, this is relegated to a low B or C grade category due to its hopelessly improbable and asinine characters, badly developed plot lines and high-school student attempts at juxtapositions of mythology/symbology. It's suggestion of human origin as seeded from beyond Earth, although itself an interesting but hardly new concept to science or story-tellers, is so poorly played out over the course of the film such that events and evidence supporting the idea insult all but the most forgiving intelligence. The first ten minutes spelled out what was to be a rollercoaster downward spiral into unlikely character reactions (or even character selections for such a 'mission' in the first place), lack of mystery or suspense, infantile references to religion and the unforgiving wonder of 'is something actually going to happen in this movie', alongside a plethora of 'why on Earth did he/she do that?' moments, too many to count in fact. No one wants a sequel/prequel to walk precisely the same steps as the original, but one would at least hope that a fragment of that same cinematic or atmospheric essence would exist, but alas as much as Alien was an adult minded film enjoyed by all ages, this dreadful prequel is a cliche laden teenage sci-fi that does not stand the test of even a single sitting, It's bad enough to make the Star Wars prequels look even favourable. I neither know nor care what happened at the end as I didn't quite make it that far, but my partner who did make it indicated that my few extra minutes of time relaxing elsewhere were far more valuable than their moments spent pursuing the conclusion. Fortunately this prequel does no damage to the original movie, as it is so 'alienated' from it that one feels no intimate connection. Summary: bad in concept, design and execution. Really this was made by Ridley Scott? What happened? All I can say is, be very, very careful with Blade Runner if that's genuinely your next target Ridley.

The obligatory sex scene was readily as gratuitous, and painfully less-entertaining than, the same such scene in Starship Troopers, the very scene that came to mind as I watched this mindless re-enactment.  I was particularly dismayed at the portrayal (talking script here) of ""Dr"" Charlie Holloway; seems to me that an intellectual who has paid the academic dues that most with a PhD have suffered would rarely make the kind of thoughtless, movie-script-time-constrained kinds of decisions and statements this character made, and it distracted me repeatedly - of all the movie characters about whom we think (or yell at the screen)  ""DON'T DO IT!"" this guy was one of the hardest for me to stomach. There was another character, played by Sean Harris, who was there for rocks (geologist, presumably) who was excessively temperamental for all the wrong reasons, also a distraction.  Mr. Harris is a fine actor, as were all the stars and character actors alike in this rewrite of ten rewrites...I hope he and all the rest were paid reasonably well and get more work going forward.

If the characters did not have fame and stardom accompanying their names, they would be invisible. They were all dull, two dimensional and unlikeable and really did not offer anything beside reciting sci-fi technobabble.  I did not get the point of Fassbender's character (and he wasn't particularly convincing as an android). They would drop hints to him about not being human and not having a soul and he seemed rather ""hurt"" but that observation went nowhere. There were moments of tension and mystery introduced, that went nowhere and were never explained. it was unclear why the man  (Guy Pearce) who sponsored  this mission, came along and thought that these aliens could save him from being old and dying. It was never explained why the guy in the beginning died after drinking the contents of that round ball (or what it is even was and why he did it).

 It is also unclear how those humanoids from the planet are related to humans today and what that alien species was or wanted or had anything to do with any of this. Or why the humanoid got on a ship to go back to Earth, when the threat is the ""alien"".

And what were those holograms or other-dimension people that appeared every now and then. Why would Fassbender's character spike the other researcher's drink with the stuff he found in one of the cocoons?

The cinematography is great, but this was a boring movie. As I said, if it was not for its star-studded cast that is quite irritating actually, it would barely have made it as a late night flick  with low rating on SyFy.",1452643200,,1941,4.538681948424069

4750278,3,B005LAIHY0,"As a huge fan of the alien franchise this was somewhat disappointing, especially with that SCENE at the very end of the movie (basically a huge damn tease). However, after watching it quite a few more times I have learned to appreciate it a little more. This movie is aimed to be a prequel to the alien franchise but don't go expecting to see everyone's favorite xenomorph. All beginnings  I suppose have to start slow and this is what that film is at the start literally. It drags in the beginning. It starts to pick up half way though, and the story is really screwy to the point you either are gonna love it or hate it. The ""Engineers"" or ""Space Jockeys"" as we come to know from the first alien movie are in the films but their is no questions answered. The whole premise of the film is why were humans created ?  This is not a horror movie by any means, they do try towards the end but it does not work. You figure Ridley would have at least answered some questions, but instead it is hinted throughout the film about what the xenomorph MIGHT be created from.

SPOILERS*

  If you pay attention you can tell their are hints of the xenomorph species in the film. Ridley figured what the hell, lets throw some DNA of the alien in their and it IS their but you kind of want more of a SOLID fact. For example : The trilobite is a facehugger. No way around it, and when the engineer has his chest BURST open, well, that looks like the first xenomorph to me. Other then this, nothing is said. What was those canisters purpose ? we're they creating a bio-weapon which backfired on them ? The engineer drinks that black goo at the beginning and nothing has come from it. Was he sacrificing himself to create life ? was that earth ? They sure don't seem to like us that's apparent when the living engineer wakes up. Sooooooooo many dam questions, and what about that planet they are on ? It's not LV_426 ?

END SPOILERS**

The cast, not so great. I could have cared less for most of the characters that were in the film except for Michael Fassbender's android david. That man carried this movie. Elizabeth shaw seemed like an alright character but I guess that's because she was in the lead most of the film which gave her more time to develop. The story is really nothing special but does have it's moments, nothing mind blowing which is unfortunate as it seems it has a lot of potential which also goes back to my original complaint. No questions answered, even if you are not an alien fan.

Hopefully the announced sequel Alien: Covenant will answer these and More.

In general it is a decent movie IMO, just don't expect to have answers, this is supposed to be apart of a trilogy. All beginnings have a slow start.",1452556800,,2713,4.3757455268389664

Some of the reviewers try to pick on ""illogical"" DETAILS and doom the film being bad, although those details can be explained simply, if somebody wants to try.

I admit, there are some small things, which I also recognized while watching, but I can slip over them. Those things still don't ""ruin"" the general fun.

I liked the story and I think the movie is made well. I like it, how it uses just small details from the Alien movies, like the image of the ""Space Jokey"", to spin a whole new story around them and explain things in the Alien universe, we didn't know before.",1451347200,,772,4.202702702702703
4750545,3,B005LAIHY0,"This movie could have been great, and there are elements of it that are. Sadly, it is shackled by some terribly written characters and plot holes that shouldn't have been missed. I could go on for awhile about all of the above but will keep it brief. Minor spoilers ahead.

To start with, this group of people wouldn't even be on this planet looking for these aliens if it weren't for some cave drawings that supposedly led them there. So we're to believe that the aliens visited earth and left instructions for them to follow. But then, later in the film, it's made clear that this is not where the aliens live. It's a military outpost where they were planning a biological attack on earth, only to have their weapon turn on them and destroy them before they could carry out their mission. So when and why did they send aliens to earth with directions to this outpost? I don't know how to make sense of this, and this is only the most glaring of the problems with the plot. The overall arc is fairly simple, straightforward and interesting, making an excellent foundation for a great sci-fi movie, but the devil is running amok in the details. This movie should not have made it to release in the form that it did.

As for the characters, I found it impossible to relate because I found it impossible to understand their motivation. And I don't mean merely that I wouldn't have done the things they did or that I didn't like what they did. I mean that there doesn't appear to be any plausible connection between who they are, what they want, and how they behave. They're scientists with no regard for science. They're deathly afraid of dead aliens in one scene. A few scenes later they are making baby talk and trying to pet a terrifying, live, snake-like alien. The list goes on and on. There were either too many cooks in this kitchen or one very schizophrenic cook. Either way, the characters are a mess and impossible to get behind.

That said, this is a beautiful movie. Everything looks and sounds incredible, and you can't help but keep watching to see how this beautiful mess is going to end. Hopefully, if a sequel is to be forthcoming, we will be rewarded for enduring this film with all of its flaws.",1451174400,,2212,4.511221945137157

4750598,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is not a perfect film - probably its biggest flaw is in the casting, which is nowhere near what Ridley Scott had to work with in his Alien, which launched this series of (now) five films, and his first re-visit to his own franchise. However, he has never gone wrong in his casting of the replicants Ash (Ian Holm), Bishop (Lance Henrikson) and now Michael Fassbender (David), with the latter two stealing the movies that they were in (well... for Henrikson he didn't steal Aliens away from Sigourney Weaver, but he definitely owned the only good scene in Alien 3).

Prometheus features great action, disgusting alien effects (especially at the end), a few revelations about what was going on in Alien (especially the peeling back of the Space Jockey, and the re-appearance of his command chair), while also introducing the Engineers, gigantic mega-evolved aliens. Fascinating. Unfortunately, the film ultimately evolves into a fight-for-survival disaster film of sorts, only hinting at great things to come with the next Prometheus films. Nice. Guy Pierce puts in a strange performance as a heavily made-up coot, and Charlize Theron and Idris Elba's talents are mostly wasted here (although there are nice hints at space sex thrown in... finally!). The descent to drunknness of Charlie, the character played by Logan Marshall-Green is quite mysterious (as is his strange resemblance to Michael Wincott, who plays Elgyn in Alien Resurrection!), as is the curious situation that David's android seems so much more sophisticated than either Kane or Bishop (who were developed centuries after David), but that's all just quibbling, I guess; still, Charlie's demotion from leading scholar to quivering idiot is something that bugs me more than just a little!

The sandstorm is a nice effect (we saw another one in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol), and Idris Alba's nonchalant Stephen Still reference is something new to the series. Fitfield and Milburn are strange characters (especially Fitfield's attempts to play with the ""cute"" alien - we've seen things like that before), but the skull mountain is pretty cool, as is the pools of alien DNA wandering about the ship. The caesarean scene is bloody intense, definitely the best part of the movie, with a blood-splattered Dr Shaw wandering around, near Ripley-like. Nice. ""Doesn't everyone want their parents dead?"" Chthulu-like creature, fast-moving story.

Only a few bonus features, mainly the six deleted and alternate scenes that run for 11 minutes. There's another scene with the Christmas tree, a tunnel scene with alien skin, an amazing African folk tale told by Dr Shaw, and an intense pre-sex scene between her and Charlie that plays very different from the one that's actually in the film. ""They're dead, we're all alone."" ""You're a drunk, you're embarrassing, Charlie."" ""Maybe there was an outbreak - I was in Africa."" Vickers talking with David, and another speech between Vickers and Wyland.",1449792000,2,2965,5.211740041928721

4751412,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's much anticipated Sci-Fi thriller 'Prometheus' opens spectacularly with a bird's eye view of an unknown planet, filled with unchilled rocks and soils in the dryly dark brown color, with traces of lavas still solidifying in spades. Forming slowly and gliding over the vast landscape is a shadow of a giant alien spaceship exploring the unknown territory carrying out a seemingly non-routine aviation. The time is in the distant past, the place in a far corner of the universe. Soon an alien life form, a.k.a. 'Engineer' emerges over the top of a great fall, holding a chemical compound in one hand, getting ready to execute a ritual ordered by his tribe. Upon drinking the chemical he quickly turns into a zombi-like creature, falls down the fall, then disintegrates into DNA cells on the bottom of the water.

Shortly, a spacecraft named 'Prometheus' is on its course into the deep space carrying a dozen human scientists and engineers. The time is now 2093 and they are on a special mission to search and find an extra-terrestrial who could be responsible for the birth of mankind a couple hundred thousands years ago.

These are brilliantly conceived and designed images, so astonishing in its impact, stunningly real that you can almost touch and smell the soil on the planet. Here and elsewhere - as expected of the director - there are visually magnificent scenes abound in this film; the interior of the abandoned alien spacecraft, with its creepy walls full of paintings of mysterious creatures and smoldering floor, is a masterpiece of a bold imagination and high artistry. Later, when the secret of the spaceship is revealed it is relished with the most impressive visual extravaganza I could ever recall seeing in the genre, i.e., the 3D holographic map of Cosmos projected by its GPS system.

Despite the abundance of the special effects, at the heart of the film is the question - where did we come from and where do we go from here? Prometheus is single-mindedly and genuinely thought provoking in a way Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't; it suggests through the strong, ominous visuals and shrewdly structured narrative that after all the origin of mankind may be just as meaningless as a tiny dust in this vast universe.

Speaking of the storyline, it is somewhat 'linear' in that the elements of horror and profundity furiously alternate without much conjuring up in between. But that may be Ridley Scott's point: in space logic does not prevail unless we create it and attach it. Thus, the only exception in the film is the android, David, played brilliantly with much verve by Michael Fassbender (I have yet to see a bad performance by this actor). He is nothing if he is not controlled by a carefully pre-programmed logic. But we know that he is longing for his own freedom which will be bestowed when his master dies. Early on, David is seen combing his hair trying to look like Peter O'Toole in 'Lawrence of Arabia'. He even mimics the English actor, ""The trick is not minding that it hurts."" Later on, David utters another quote from Lawrence of Arabia, taken far more seriously,""Big things have small beginnings.""

Ultimately, it is the unforgettable image of the 'Engineer' that will haunt, mesmerize the audience. Covered with crystal, white jewel-like skin and with the dark, empty eyes that seem to stare at you aimlessly, it is a symbol of a higher being that is sovereign but also manically destructive. It strongly evokes a feeling that the purpose and origin of our existence might be moot and we are always at the mercy of the indifferent universe. At one point, David asks one of the crew members, ""Why do you want to know who created you? You might be disappointed when you find out."" The crew answers: ""Because we are humans, we are emotional."" God creates a life... but he also takes it back whenever he wants to. You could draw a parallel between its theme and Bible here - Apocalypse.

See it on IMAX and in 3D. It will stun you, shock you, and stir you with its deeply pessimistic vision of ourselves and the Cosmos surrounding us.",1446508800,5,4098,4.8056737588652485

4752029,3,B005LAIHY0,"I watched this film again the other night, and in all honesty, after three years Im still not sure how to embrace it. My introduction to Ridley Scott came back in 1979 when a group of us went to the theater to see Alien. We left awestruck by its creative vision of a fully realized working class future and the surrealistic lifecycle of the Big Chap was gruesomely unique. Then seven years later James Camerons blew our minds once again when he released his 1986 followup.

(**Big shoutout to Stan Winston**)

Both films are science fiction classics though each takes a different approach. Where Scotts was more of a constructionworkerinspace haunted house thriller Camerons delivered a furious ballstothe walls shoot em up! And here in lies one of my concerns with Prometheus. If Scott was trying to recreate that blue collar feel to his space travelers he succeeded well with some characters and failed miserably with others. Here are some random thoughts that contain significant *spoilers*

(+) The creepy android David suffered a wonderful superiority complex. The emotional / physical suffering of Dr. Shaw was palpable. Janek had the closest thing to an accurate blue collar reaction and I liked his twoman bridge crew.

(-) Then we have one jaded geologist (Fiefield) who has turned his helmet into a functioning bong and one ridiculous biologist (Milburn) who wants to pet a beautiful alien snake? These two came off more like morons and quickly paid the price.

(+/ -) There is always one WeylandYutani corporate SOB. This probably falls better to David than Charlize Therons mysteriously human (?) portrayal of Vickers. Guy Pearces portrayal of an elderly Peter Weyland was decent but ultimately came off as a guy in heavy old man makeup.

(-) Then we have the brash & and annoying free spirit of a scientist who tests the alien air by taking his helmet off? I mean, Christopher Columbus delivered enough infectious disease to almost wipe out Hispaniola and this Dr. Holloways is doing this on an alien rock?

(+) Overall the cinematography was outstanding and the futuristic technology inventive. I liked the design of the engineers even if they were noticeably scaled down from Alien and the creature effects for the disgusting trilobite & newborn Deacon were all topnotch.

(-) One final observation; Someone should have told Vickers that if you are ever scrambling across a barren alien landscape with a huge spaceship wagon wheeling towards you that you can step to one side.

I realize this film has inspired a robust dialog and these are just a few of my humble observations thrown out into the dark abyss of the Internet. Love it or hate it, the story really had potential and heres to the hopes that a sequel can round the story out.",1444521600,,2753,4.877944325481799

4752235,3,B005LAIHY0,"The original title for ALIEN was Star Beast and it was generally considered to be an awful title.

Ive been a huge fan of the original film since it was first released in 1979 (and to a slightly lesser extent, James Camerons excellent sequel).  Back then I read everything I could about it, and any time I came across anyone involve with the production actually talking about the choice of ALIEN as the title, the point was always made that the word alien was great because it worked effectively as both a noun and an adjective.

Prior to ALIEN, H.R. Gigers exposure to the general public via pop culture was primarily thanks to Brain Salad Surgery, the album by Emerson, Lake and Palmer.  Today, thanks to ALIEN, Gigers work is very well known, has a host of imitators and has influenced other productions and pop culture in general.  My point is that the near ubiquity of his style today, makes it easy to forget that in 1979 the imagery in ALIEN was shockingly unique, disturbing and bizarre.  It was very easy for audiences back then to suspend disbelief and see the non human elements in the film as the result of an otherworldly biology and evolutionary path, and to imagine that what we saw was just a small sample of an alien civilization consisting of horrors yet to be seen.

But now?  No.  Thanks to Prometheus, it turns out that the aliens behind the xenomorphs, are not only NOT alien, they're our kin folk; cousins a thousand times removed and more closely related to us than our closest relatives, the Bonobo chimps.

Oh well, so much for the adjective alien, goodbye murky and eldritch mystery.

The engineers were never meant to be humanoids, that much is obvious by the fact that the original space jockey looks to be nearly twice the size of the engineers in Prometheus.  Theres also the fact that while Ash does not explicitly state that the face hugger is a silicon based life form, there is dialog that heavily implies it.  We, and now by necessity the engineers, are carbon based.  This doesnt mean that the engineers couldn't also engineer silicon based life forms but the fact that it was mentioned at all in ALIEN seemed to push the idea of otherness.

Also, the space jockey, as Dallas observed, really was growing out of the chair because it probably couldn't walk.  How do we know this?  The space jockeys hand is wrapped around its thigh bone.  When alive, the layer of muscle that the space jockey had surrounding its thigh bone was probably just meager enough to allow it to push foot controls.  I don't have to tell you that its impossible for a person to wrap their hands around their thigh.  Now, its certainly possible for you to die and decompose in a sitting position with your hand resting on your thigh, but after all of your flesh has decomposed, your cold skeletal hand won't suddenly close around your thigh bone like the proverbial 2nd amendment enthusiast gripping his gun.

Back then, my impression of the space jockey race was that it had grown so proficient in genetic engineering that it grew everything, including the obviously organic derelict ship, and that unlike humans, they were varied in shape and abilities based on their expected roles, enforced via genetic engineering like some extreme version of a Brave New World like caste system.  After all, not everyone could be glued to their chair, someone had to walk around and do things.  As for the xenomorphs, I thought they, were a separate creation.

Naturally, I didn't expect the prequels to match my ideas as far as engineer biology is concerned but I certainly didn't expected them to be human-ish given the use of the word ALIEN in EVERY SINGLE OTHER FILM including the engineer awful I mean god awful Alien vs. Predator films.

Ridley Scott seems to have found religion of late and if the speculation surrounding the reasons why the engineers want to kill off the human race is correct, this is unfortunate because ALIEN, in spite of its basic b-movie plot is one of the most psychoanalyzed horror films of all time.  There are existentialist, Freudian, Jungian and feminists interpretations of it (more often its a mix) and Prometheus in its clumsiness seems to retroactively undo a lot of that if only because Scotts involvement gives it the weight of canon.  I can only imagine that a few scholarly heads must have exploded when they tried to fold religious ideology into the mix.

Unbelievably, I still generally like Prometheus (no one is more surprised than I am) but I cant tell you how much I hate that they stripped the alien strangeness out of the franchise.  As for all those titles with the word ALIEN in them?  Those titles (just the titles) have been rendered ineffective.",1443830400,,4701,4.697560975609756

The making of the pre-xenomorph creatures as the perfect biological weapon is pretty darn scary. The humans acidentally release it and  The Engineers get ticked off, thats the reason they acted hostile. It also puts a whole Ancient Astronaut aspect to the series. While not for everyone, its worth a watch.",1441929600,,686,4.708333333333333

The visual panorama and the acting in ""Prometheus"" are compelling. But the ideas that would otherwise support a high-concept story about the origin and fate of humanity are mostly missing. We're expected to believe that the creatures who acted to create and now may try to finish off the human race are casually violent, and that the structure on the planet which is the crossroads for this story is booby-trapped with savage bio-devices. It's not much more than a haunted-house plot in outer space.

I finally got to watch Prometheus -- and I watched it in 3D, as I recently started getting addicted to watching 3D films at home.

I feel Prometheus is definitely one of those films that must be enjoyed on the big screen/surround sound -- and 3D just makes it more immersive, making you truly experience that unique universe. It's like 2001: Space Odyssey and Lawerence in Arabia where it had to be experienced in a theater... if not, the film just feels slow and boring for most -- it's the EXPERIENCE that is entertaining (This is also the same with Gravity... many find that film boring on a standard screen, but it is really spectacular experience in 3D).

The 3D in this has none of the gimmick 3D effects, but it's all naturally used well in the environment rooms, spaceship, and vehicles. There are some really grotesque scenes in this film that can be really traumatizing! The 3D is very impressive and natural that it didn't even feel like I'm watching a ""3D film"", but more like seeing through a glass; seeing the alien tenticles grab in 3D looks very good and quite frightening. However, the storm dust in 3D made it difficult to see what exactly was going on for me; I had no idea who was trying to save who.

I believe people that hated Prometheus are major Alien fans who were disappointed storywise with their expectations; people who are critical about science and religion being 100% realistic; and people who are turned off by grotesque scenes.

I mean, I do agree, some of the behavior were outrageous; like when the lost archeologist crew was totally afraid and scared, yet when the guy first encountered a snake alien creature, he was overly calm and playful with it! That doesn't make sense. Some of the crews simply sacrificing themselves just seem very unnatural, actually cheesy, and just for dramatic effect. There is also a ""Star Wars""-like twist that was also predictable and cheesy as well.

Despite the flaws, I still feel it was worth the 3D experience into this strange world... it really is an escape from reality. It definitely leaves you wanting more as the sequel will come out next year in 2016; I'm interested. Michael Fassbender is very good as the robot (this is not a spoiler, it's mentioned very early on in the film). The grotesque scenes really don't hold back and it's really disturbing. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed or felt the same if I didn't see it in 3D because seeing the environment in 3D made it interesting alone.",1438732800,,2739,4.637113402061856

This movie is for people who like to figure things out, find the hard to spot details or catch the hidden meanings the director meant to add.

It's an extreme situation,  and in extreme situations humans tend to have poor judgment.  It's not poor charater writing , it's excellent true to life character writing.

The down side is that those criticisms were valid about the plot holes and some story elements that just don't ring true. I guess it is a surprise since the pedigree of the director is up there (Ridley Scott).  I sat there thinking at how some characters were just so stereotypical, very predictable.

Ridley Scott clearly wants to raise lots of Big Questions in ""Prometheus"" - and does so, baldly, in the dialogue.  But then he never answers any of them, and can't come up with any appropriate action to advance his Deep Thoughts; so he's reduced to tagging memorable scenes from the movie's many predecessors without adding anything particularly new to the franchise.  And alas, the talented, sexy cast is largely wasted (aside from Fassbender as a droll, T.E. Lawrence-like droid).  Even the xenomorph, when it finally shows up, is a letdown; and I defy anyone to be frightened by the big, squishy squid-thing.  I remember in Alien 4, we saw H.R.

4754551,2,B005LAIHY0,"An elaborate, and awe-inspiring technologically advanced space expedition in the year 2094 is embarked upon based on the interpretive smatterings of a group of primitive cave-art drawings on planet Earth. The expedition takes a motley crew of bumbling idiots across 5 quadrillion miles of the universe to an obscure moon of a distant planet to find out who may or may not have genetically engineered them. That is the premise of the story, I think, although I'm not really sure. The expedition is financed by a senile and decrepit CEO of an unidentified corporation, who believes that the last remaining giants of this alien race, who just happen to share an exact match with our human DNA, will somehow give him immortality if he can just find them. He decides to fund this costly expedition based on the dubious supposition set forth by an idealistic and naive scientist/paleoanthropologist who believes that the human race was created by these benevolent aliens for the good of mankind. The goofy crew of this far-fetched space adventure consists of a few scientists, geologists, a small security detail, a captain of the space exploratory ship and his two-man crew, an evil android, an overseer of the expedition, and her one-foot-in-the-grave father, who is hidden from the rest of the passengers. The story slides downhill from there with an implausibly inept crew who defies all logic and reason with their consistently foolish maneuvers on this ill-fated trip. If Mr. Spock had to endure five minutes with these individuals, he would have commandeered the self-contained pod and jumped ship.
Here are a few of my favorite moments of the movie:
1.) The captain warns the expedition team who are exploring the tunnels to make haste in returning to the ship since a caustic cosmic storm is quickly descending upon them. He warns that whoever gets caught in the caustic brew will have his/her space suit fried by the silica. During the time of his warning, Shaw decides to take a decapitated alien head back to the ship in a potato bag. Everyone is racing back to the ship in their dune buggies. As Shaw ascends the ship's ramp, the potato bag with the alien's head flies off the dune buggy. The ominous storm is quickly gaining ground about two feet away from her. Instead of leaving the alien head on the ground and running up the ramp as fast as her feet can carry her, she decides to turn back and try to retrieve it, which endangers everyone onboard. Personally, I was hoping that Shaw and her ridiculous boyfriend, Charlie would be flung into something hard and metal by the winds, and that would be the end of the them.
2.) The two geologists, Millburn and Fifield, neither who feels comfortable with the discovery of the dead alien, decide to leave everyone behind and return to the ship.  For some inexplicable reason, the geologists end up lost in the labyrinth of tunnels even though the ship has a 3-D hologram layout of the underground structure from the  scanning and mapping balls that were released into the structure when the crew first arrived. The captain off-handedly tells them to hold tight until tomorrow after the storm subsides, and then he'll pick them up. How does he know when the storm will pass since he's never been on the planet before? It could last six months for all he knows. Instead of staying by the entrance to the cave to avoid any encounters with the unknown, the two geologists wander back into the giant hall containing the strange alien cylinders with black ooze swirling around them. A snake-like creature emerges from the ooze, which Milburn decides to make his girlfriend. When he tries to caress her, the cobra-like alien decides Milburn is not her type, and wraps around his arm constricting it until it breaks, then rams herself down his throat. Meanwhile, Fifield decides to cut the alien snake loose with his trusty pocket-knife, which offends the alien snake. The snake retaliates by spewing acid at his face, which eats through his helmet and kills him. Of cousre, he reappears later in the movie as a zombified spider man with incredible strength and reticulated joints.
I could list many other ridiculous scenes in this sci-fi movie, but other reviewers have already done so. Unfortunately, I could not suspend my disbelief long enough to ignore the stupidity of the characters, along with the mediocrity of the script. The script seemed as if it was written by a sophomore in middle school in a creative writing class. Honestly, I kept hoping that the characters would die in the first half hour of the film. The CGI effects and set designs were impressive, but not enough to carry the film. Unfortunately, it seems like standard fare these days for directors and producers to place too much emphasis on the special effects and pay too little attention to the storyline, the characters, and the quality of the script.",1433635200,2,4878,4.840718562874251

4754657,3,B005LAIHY0,"One the positive side the film was well acted and completely special effects spectacular. The story was exciting and thorough. The production value for this film was epic and the action was truly intense. The story did not disappoint as far as bringing us face to face with the Architects and the beginning point for this whole reality that envelopes both the Prometheus story and the Alien saga. There was no forced scenes where the cast seemed to compete with one another as a lot of films with such star power tend to have. However for me the story seemed to force way more substance than it could contain with relativity to the universe and plot set forth in this film. It felt as if a lot of material was being crammed into the movie which didn't allow for the actual story line and sequences to relax and satisfy the over all plot.

The attention to subtle suspense somehow got overpowered by the sheer amount of story that had to be told in the film. Prometheus is a great story that I was glad to see on screen and that final money shot that gives us our first glimpse of those terrifying alien creatures we have grown to love and fear was truly monumental. However I felt overwhelmed by fast paced race to the finish line the movie pulled me into and wished the whole thing would have had a more casual steady built to the thrills. For what it was Prometheus did not completely disappoint but almost felt it was a bigger story than the film could handle.",1433462400,,1463,4.438661710037175
4754658,4,B005LAIHY0,"Chock full of plot and character problems, but a beloved film to many viewers! I watched it several times trying to figure out the opening sequence, then finally gave up and read through some interviews with the director.  Once I began to understand some of his choices (from his perspective) I found the that this story became even more interesting to me.  I have to wonder about the future of this film....many sci fi films do not do well when released (look at Blade Runner's history) yet stand the test of time because they are thinking about things in a unique way.  Perhaps it's because of the strong female lead character, perhaps because the film wrestles with the age old question of humanity's origins....and our future, I will always appreciate this movie.  Do I wish certain aspects and details were handled a bit differently? Yes!

4754662,3,B005LAIHY0,"To quote Alfred Hitchcock, ""To make a great film you need three things -- the script, the script, and the script."" And in the case of PROMETHEUS its the script that lets it down. Although its an undeniably impressive spectacle it suffers from an all too familiar and sometimes flagging plot, stereotypical characterisation, and some pretty dire dialogue. It does have loftier goals than the previous movies in the Alien franchise, and thats laudable, but it fails to give appropriate weight to its higher concepts. Having said all this, PROMETHEUS is still an entertaining and enjoyable movie, its just a shame that its greater thematic ambitions were lost along the way.",1433030400,,671,5.054054054054054

I won't go into the plot (for the sake of those who may have not yet seen the film), but suffice it to say that the whole plot felt forced to me and hence my three stars. I had hoped for something more original, but this movie seems to be more of a collage of the past movies in the Alien series with a pinch of social messages interspersed here and there.

4754810,4,B005LAIHY0,"There's very little I can say that hasn't been covered by other reviewers. But, I genuinely enjoyed this movie at a number of levels. It's a good basic story, good sci-fi and visually attractive. I found this prequel to the ""Aliens"" films worth my time.

Archeologists Charlie Holloway and Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) see the same celestial representation in ancient representations all over the world - from those carved in stone in ancient Sumer and Egypt to cave paintings in the Scottish Highlands. All these representations hint at ancient visitation by extra-terrestrials. The two convince an aging industrialist to fund an expedition to the place these representations point to in the cosmos in order to find the origins of our species.

The expedition includes an android (well played by Michael Fassbender) who, during the long voyage to the planet, becomes a skilled linguist in order to translate any written...or verbal communications they may find. The ship touches down and the team indeed does find a facility created by the ""engineers"" as the extra-terrestrials are called.

There are several plot holes and acts that require one to suspend disbelief, but the story itself is about origins and the desire to find one's origins. The science part is reasonably believable and the plot takes a few very interesting twists. The film itself will shock, surprise and give one a shiver at times! The roles are well cast with the exception of one of the supporting characters and the cinematography is very good. I thought it was visually impressive.

This is a good film in the ""Aliens"" series that I thought went beyond the usual horror-story-in-space and approached something higher, more sophisticated. I recommend this movie to those interested with four stars.",1432252800,,1811,5.149659863945578

The good:  The cinematography is well done, maybe even stunning.  The soundtrack is quite good, if not unobtrusive.

The bad:  The screenplay is marginal - filled with holes, inconsistencies, and poor character development.  The acting is marginal, but then it's a product of a (in my opinion) poor script.  Near the end of the film, the action/plot seems rather incoherent.

By the end of the film, I found I cared about the main character - Elizabeth Shaw.  Despite my mediocre review, I found the film interesting and enjoyable.  But then, I like sci fi.",1431388800,,706,4.848739495798319

4756438,1,B005LAIHY0,"From top to bottom this film was a super disappointment.  I could not believe how utterly bad this movie was after I left the theater, completely disappointed and disgusted that the same film makers, and creators of a masterpiece movie like ""Aliens"" with Sigorny Weaver, could cook up such a piece of trash film.

 I don't even know where to begin with this turkey, supposedly a prequel to the first ""Alien"" movie, a group of scientist go out to a distant remote planet where they believe ancient civilizations interacted with advanced alien intelligent life.  Following an ancient star chart written by cavemen or the Assyrians (fill in the blank) the explorers travel to this remote distant planet.

 Then the movie turns into a pile of waste real quick, with horrible non scientific decisions made by the astronaut crew left and right after they first run into the remains of one of the ""Star Engineers"", the supposed aliens who created life on Earth. When this remote planet actually turns out to be a weapons storage depot things get ugly real quick, and I do not mean just the ugly monsters on screen.

  At one point in the movie I had said, ""Did these writers just say screw it and write anything just to end this film?""  We have a Commander of the spaceship who during the intense activity, decides out of the blue to stop his work and have sex with Charlize Theron for absolutely no reason. (& why the f&%k not, she is a hot smoking heavenly blond bombshell.  I rather be screwing her too then act out any more scenes in this rotten movie).

The super smart Android, who figures out more in ten minutes then the rest of the characters could conceptualize in their lifetimes combined, is basically ignored and cast back into the space ship, where for NO reason and NO motivation decides to go on his own sinister if not shady agenda of his own.

 Then we have ghosts of past aliens, or holograms of ghost aliens running around the alien fortress ship which really doesn't led us anywhere in this plot other then to say, ""Okay that looks cool.""

 Then later we have the lady scientist have a laser robotic guided abortion of this giant crab alien monster, which we assume is the origin of those ugly ""facehuging"" aliens???

So we fight with this ugly creature for a while until later the heroes finally run into the brilliant all knowing life creating ""Star Engineers"", when they are brought back to life after being in suspended animation.  And what do these all wise, all enchanting aliens say when encountering their now evolved human creation?  Why loud monster like screeches of pure horror and ferocity of course!  What else do we expect from such advanced aliens, maybe something witty or intelligent? Nah we only need more ferocious creatures!

 Finally to top off the brilliance of this plot direction & screen writing (because Charlize Theron is a fantastic and remarkable actress who still could not carry this film) we have the Commander and his pilots decide to perform their own ""9-11"" like final act by crashing their spaceship into their enemy, filled with joy and excitement while attempting to commit suicide, ""Yeah so cool! Let's kill ourselves man, yeah so much fun!"" Were these writers high on drugs when coming up with these scenes?

 The writers of this film clearly tried to commit franchise suicide of the classic masterpiece ""Aliens"", but luckily those of us who are still real fans of that franchise will not recognize this turkey as apart of the cannon.  F+ and thumbs way down.",1425686400,,3514,4.721311475409836

4756574,5,B005LAIHY0,"It's an easy movie to criticize, but it doesn't deserve it.  I'm not giving the fifth star because it's absolutely perfect.  But, given the way it fits with the Alien films, but goes in new directions, this really is one of the great recent science fiction films.
A lot of people have criticized a number of the ""campy""/bonehead plot devices the film contains.  I think the funniest is the one about the worst direction to run if a giant rolling, round spaceship is about to crush you (hilarious).
But it's easy to criticize some of the shallower holes or weak links in the plot and not acknowledge the healthy condition of the broad bones of the plot structure.  What made Alien (and the Alien series) great was plot structure and concept (and Ridley Scott's skillful execution of it).  The thrills and chills were there because of the combination of realism and symbolism in the plot--because it was good science fiction.  Science fiction has always been a lot more symbolic than scientific, and it was the ability of the creature to hold so much symbolic weight that made it so frightening, not just the art and special effects.
Prometheus builds on this symbolic complexity by looking out into space (the divine unknown) not for the supreme anti-human force this time (Alien's alien), but for the ""divine"" origins of human beings.  It's interesting.  Scott makes the puzzle about these divine-human creatures (the engineers in Prometheus) as compelling as the creature in Alien.  A little more intellectual and less visceral--but pretty similar.
It is structured as a brainy science fiction film.  Science fiction has always been about heavy symbolism in a high-energy, pulpy package.  So I'm fine with unexplained spider zombie characters, and blatant, thin, pulpy, gore-y plot devices (in fact I enjoy them, think they're essential for the genre and overall effect, and would miss them if they were gone), as long as the backbone of the film is solid.  And it is.  Naomi Rapace's character is solid, and Michael Fassbender's.  And guess who's left at the end of the film?  Only the characters that mattered.
Plus it's visually beautiful.  And the way Scott weaved in so many Alien concepts into an original story in a way that built the whole thing up into a broader and still consistent world-- instead of dragging it down --is also extremely impressive.
This movie will be appreciated a lot more a few years down the road.  And even more so if a good sequel follows.",1425427200,,2474,4.852380952380952

What Biologist in his right mind would allow:
1. Everyone to remove their helmets? (remember the big fuss about quarantine in ALIEN?)
2. And even more stupid, try and play with an unknown, hostile acting just discovered creature? (remember, some animals that avoid man, yet sometimes appear friendly are actually RABID;

The writing was of Hollywood/TV schlock. the writers were in way over their heads

The cast should have shrunk to 10-too many people to keep track of and some you never see....or have any real purpose

But instead we get a movie that has almost nothing to do with the Alien franchize. They take place in the same universe and this does come before the first Alien movie but, the story has nothing to do with the movies, except for the company, a statue, and ""the ending"". How ever it's not a bad movie just don't expect a ""Alien"" prequel. Second the characters, the character David ( Michael Fassbender) is by far the best in the whole movie, And Idris Elba's character is great too, but everyone else is just average or just plain stupid. Elizabeth Shaw(Noomi Rapace) isn't to bad either but she has her moments. And her boyfriend is a dick I still have no idea why he hated David so much, because he was an android? I don't know he just doesn't like him for some reason. Then there's the map maker and the biologist with the snake, I won't go to deep into it but that's one of those ""really movie, really"" monents. Also this movie leaves TOO MANY questions unanswered. There is suppost to be a sequel in the works but there are so many questions that they should call this Part 1 of 2. Over all I did enjoy this movie, but from the characters, to the story, and the lack of Xenos in this ""Alien prequel"" it's really just above average. I give it a 6/10! Also I do have a problem with the the logic the main character has, for example (SPOILER: when they find one of the ""aliens"" dead and study it and they see that it shares the same DNA as a human doesn't mean they created humans it just means were related to them!)",1423008000,,1671,4.241379310344827

There is absolutely no effort to make a good prequel to the Alien franchise, but rather a massive effort to attract the new generation audience into theaters.  Clearly, the 1000 five star reviews are from people involved in the production of the film, actors, technicians, friends and relatives.  This has become the norm for promoting lousy movie box office bombs in an effort to offset the multitude of expected negative reviews on release of the DVD.  Very sad that the success of many movies these days is more based on excellent marketing, rather than simply making a good effort to produce a good movie.  Great marketing can sell flashlights to blind people, and that's what marketing firms do most of the time.

4757928,4,B005LAIHY0,"Given its very mixed reception (with only 35% of 683 reviews to date scoring it 4* or better) and being a great fan of the first three Alien movies (the fourth effort doesn't really count) I was ready to be a bit disappointed by this film. Thankfully, I was not. Visually it is stunning, combining state-of-the-art CGI with claustrophobic interiors and Scott's trademark sweeping cinematic art & legendary attention to detail. The lead cast are all great actors but there doesn't seem to be much leadership or team cohesion and it's obvious from the very start who are the two `red jumpers'. You'd have thought that for a mission of this magnitude every team member would have been psychologically profiled to the n'th degree but no, as soon as the away team leaves the ship there's bickering, nobody's in charge and everybody seems to have had their common sense surgically removed. This does rather spoil the plausibility of the away team scenes.

What this film is not short on, however, is ambition. It sets out to explain the start of the Alien story while exploring the origins of human kind and touching on the big unanswerable question all in a nice shiny sci-fi wrapper. To some extent, it succeeds, but it does raise a lot more questions than it answers. Perhaps it is all set up for a sequel to tie up the loose ends or perhaps Fox doesn't care about loose ends as only die-hard fans of the Alien films will notice them and they're not the intended audience. At the end of the day, I don't suppose it matters; this is a big budget sci-fi romp and as such it is a very enjoyable experience and maybe we're expecting too much depth. The special features `extended beginning' helps make sense of the confusing start to the film but the rest of the deleted scenes don't really add anything.

I do like the classical reference in the title, Prometheus being the titan who was expelled from Olympus for having created mankind and then given them the secret of fire therefore laying the foundation for civilisation. Interesting, he also represents the human quest for knowledge at the potential cost of unforeseen consequences. This ties nicely to the Engineer creation myth and the ultimate fate of their base on LV-322. Mind you, he was also chained to a rock and destined to have his liver pecked out by an eagle every day as a punishment for his transgression and that doesn't have a parallel in this film.

There follows a brief prcis of the questions/plot holes/loose ends which are currently rattling around in my head (which just go to show that (a) I've had too much free time over the extended Christmas break and (b) that I'm a complete nerd). Beware : SPOILER ALERT:

(1) If this is a prequel to the first Alien movie, then why is the action on LV-322 and not LV-426 (the location of the first Alien)? This would suggest that there is another Engineer outpost where the bio-engineered alien broke free (ready for a sequel?). If it is supposed to be a different planet & Engineer ship, this explains why there is no `exploded' Engineer sitting in the big gun-like thing as in the first Alien movie.
(2) Why would the Engineers give the star configuration to various early human civilisations showing the location of their research outpost rather then their home planet? But then again, why not? Perhaps LV-322 is merely the nearest staging post to Earth.
(3) Why would the Engineers choose to destroy humanity with the Alien thingies rather than engineering a nice simple virus? Does this suggest that human kind was designed from the outset to be transformed into Alien thingies to create a vast number of super soldier type things?
(4) There seem to be two types of Alien. First the traditional tentacle down the throat, exploding guts, shiny pointy head type and secondly the one that transformed Charlie and Fifield into a more humanoid form.
(5) How come David could speak & read the Engineer language? Granted he's super intelligent and might have extrapolated it from archaic Earth languages but that would be like learning French by listening to English.
(6) How did David know what was in the canister and what to do with it? How did he know how to open the Engineer helmet? Does all this suggest that Wayland & therefore David knew a lot more about the Engineers before the mission set off?
(7) How could Vickers be Wayland's daughter? He's way too old unless it was an in-vitro thing. Unless, of course, she's a robot too; Wayland refers to David as his son so maybe...
(8) I'm sure there are more but I can't think of them at the moment...",1421452800,,4566,4.66832298136646

The standard in previous films was a weak, crying woman continually falling down and having to be picked up and carried by the strong male lead character.  The portrayal of the females in this film was very disappointing, but then, none of the crew of the Prometheus was likable, and they continually showed incredibly poor judgement. I found it difficult to hope for the survival of any of them except perhaps the spacecraft captain.  As a fan of Lawrence of Arabia, I loved to see the clip and quote used, and the computer graphics throughout this film were magnificent, but those positives do not make up for the poor dialog, incredibly shallow concept, and minimal believability.  I sat through this film because I am a fan of the ""Alien"" films, but this one did nothing for their memory.",1421020800,2,889,4.790849673202614

I know, it's a prequel (I was kidding about Ripley, I knew she wouldn't be in it), but this one's a loser - skip it. Knowing Ridley Scott did this one, I was looking for much more. The storyline just doesn't make any sense - the crew of the Prometheus wakes up after years of hypersleep (or whatever it's called) and immediately starts bickering like 9-year olds. Major characters are killed suddenly with no connection to the storyline. It was a string of nonsense, such as, the main character is unknowingly impregnated with an alien, realizes this, has a robotic surgeon perform a C-section on her, then jumps right up and does a whole bunch of physical superhero stuff. Huh? Two other scientists get separated from the group overnight due to some type of storm and spend the night in an alien derelict, find the usual eggs, then screw around with one they deliberately wake up (they talk to it like a puppy) until it kills one and ends up inside the other's suit, and, as expected, in his mouth....The whole movie was filled with stuff like this, and was choppy and disjointed overall.

Without spoiling the plot for anyone I can say that after watching it a few times that I'm now glad that they progressed the story the way they did. What little background info that was presented only increases the intrigue and suspense of the film without ruining the overall mystery by answering questions which are sure to not live up to the build-up. This movie really does leave you wanting more... more storyline.. more background...

A lot of people complained about this unsatisfied feeling. And I get it... but after careful contemplation, I don't think wanting more is necessarily a bad thing.

There is an old clich about horror films requiring their victims to always do the dumbest thing at any given moment in order to keep the action going.  This film warmly embraces that clich as a normative value, but goes one step further:  not only must the characters be stupid, EVERYTHING must be stupid.  People don't make sense; neither do major historical events or even physical occurrences.  Nor science.

There is a refrain in this film uttered often enough to be considered a motto or theme ""It's what I choose to believe.""  When asked why they spent a trillion dollars on a giant spaceship to travel unfathomable distances in pursuit of a theory that seemed arbitrarily strung together from incoherent historical artifacts, and all of which, if true, would run directly contrary to everything we know regarding evolutionary biology, what is the response?  ""It's what I choose to believe.""  That doesn't come from the janitor justifying his preference for loganberry to lavender air freshener:  that's a scientist justifying his life work.  How did he ever make it out of graduate school?  I had a Logic 101 professor my freshman year of schooling that would have vomited on him had he said that, and yet, there he is.  The whole film is a collection of insipid nonsense like that.

On the other hand, the set design was quite lovely.  So, don't hate the crew.  They tried.",1418774400,11,1610,4.778985507246377

I suppose that is what actually makes this film interesting. There are many parallels to ALIEN, but it is the actual storyline or better yet, the dialogue that just seems so annoying. It gets in the way of the story. The crew of the Prometheus space craft seem like an inversion when compared to the crew in ALIEN. I only make the comparison to point how how different Ridley Scott attempted to make them seem current and real. The Prometheus crew and engineers seem like a bunch of obnoxious idiots. There is no sympathy for these people and hence why should the viewer care for their plight? One thing really hurt this film on a more basic level and that was Marc Streitenfeld's score. Streitenfeld's score is everywhere and it just so intrusive. It is in almost every scene and hinders the story telling.

The film has a good premise, but so much gets in the way of the story. This should have been a much better film. Michael Fassbender performance as David is one of the high points as is the computerized mechanical C-section scene, that was innovative to say the least.

If you belong to the 0.01% of the population who loved Alien for its philosophical qualities, you might find the last 20 minutes or so of Prometheus interesting. If you belong to the 99.99% who relished Ridley Scott's sense of horror, you might get away a wee bit disappointed

We (the 0.01% we) have waited a long time, decades actually, for a response to the question where did the extraterrestrial astronauts with big snouts come from? It was great, I suppose, to finally get an answer to that question. I think.

What a pity the rest of Prometheus sucks, with Noomi Rapace and the other actors coming into their own only at the last moment. Most of the time, they come across as a bunch of stupid-looking amateurs, some of them with bad accents

4759558,2,B005LAIHY0,"I finally got the chance to listen to the director's commentary on this Blu-ray of Prometheus, and it is instructive to fans of Ridley Scott and the movies.

Scott doesn't reveal much of any great importance about the techniques he used to make this Alien prequel; in fact, he comes across as a schoolboy explaining the tricks he pulled on classmates.

But it does expose his arrogance as a veteran director.  At one point, he rails about colleagues having the temerity to question his judgment and dismisses their objections as questions born of inexperience or simple stupidity.

Well, Sir Scott, maybe my decades of viewing experience fail to mask my stupidity, but IMO you haven't made a great movie since Gladiator.

And watching Prometheus again reminded me how Scott seems to have failed in the same way George Lucas did with his Star Wars prequel trilogy.  Both auteurs became so enraptured with the new digital toys available to put images on the screen that they forgot to also put heart, soul, and interesting characters there as well.

Instead Lucas gave us midi-chlorians, and in Prometheus Scott gives us DNA strands.  But he doesn't give us characters we care about, and in fact only four characters in P make any kind of impression at all.  Contrast that with the crew of the Nostromo in Alien, all of whom became sharply etched in our minds.

And as much as Scott trumpets his grasp of logic, perhaps he can explain why the technology in P is considerably more advanced than that in Alien, which supposedly took place years later.

To give Prometheus its due, it is stunning to look at.  But does the film have the impact of some of Scott's earlier masterpieces like Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, or Gladiator?  Hardly.

But the film does provide a few other pleasures, notably Michael Fassbender's wonderful performance as David the android, and a few icky and squishy creatures of the kind one can't find on the New York subway.

If it is true that Scott is working on another Blade Runner film, let us hope that he can temper his arrogance and reconnect with his humanity.  Replicants just don't make great directors.",1417910400,,2145,4.772357723577236

This is a very very good SFI-FI movie for those who are just getting into the genre.  For me, I felt the movie took some shortcuts by using exploits from the Alien movie.  This may have spoilers.
Take the Alien movie with it's dark atmospheric lighting  and add some new but similar characters and you have Prometheus.
If you liked Alien and don't mind something similar - go for it and don't read past this.

Ridley Scott made both the Alien and Prometheus movies and for me they are too similar, if you liked Alien then you may like Prometheus. I simply found too many issues with this movie.
1. For a 1 Trillion $ project the crew seemed less than professionals - Some even questioned what the purpose was or questioned why.
- There was no lead in from initial discovery of ""ancient human engineers"" cave drawings to the crew waking up on the discovery ship 2 years later.

2.  Most of the crew had different agendas, with no common objective. Pilot wanted to go in and get the heck out, the Archaeologist wanted to meet their makers, others wanted no part of it, and even bailed on the first outing  - made no sense.

3. We learn a android is on board then undermines the male archaeologist by slipping him some alien goo he picked up during an outing causing the archaeologist to be burned alive by the ships useless female commander.

4. Speaking of a useless commander. The ship has a captain and crew and also a commander who adds nothing to the film.  She eventually has sex with the commander and that is the end of her usefulness.

5. Atmosphere.  If you like watching people walk inside dark caverns your on track, most of the movie is like this.
There are a few cut scenes of beautiful clouds, but you see it all in the trailer nothing more in the full movie.

5. Characters: Mostly weak, the two females as in Scott tradition struggle to the end with one remaining, blasting off the planet in an Alien ship with the Androids head for company.  Can you say sequel?

I left a lot of the movie out, like both Archaeologist were  a couple and he got infected by an Alien worm, then fried alive by the ship's commander she got pregnant the night before and the off spring was aborted but survived then help keep her from being killed by the alien ""engineer"" who was trying to kill all humans who's ship bound for the earth was destroyed by the captain who flew his ship into the Alien ship only to discover the Alien survived and hunted down the female Archaeologist who' aborted alien son killed the engineer trying to kill her and she escapes to pick up the head of the android and fly off in another alien ship on a continuing journey to discovery why they made humans and then wanted to kill them all.",1417132800,,2791,4.369439071566731

I respect the non-position the movie takes on creationism v evolution with the movie's heroine espousing a God-created universe and others questioning that idea.  The visuals are remarkably good for the most part and that's one of the most important facets of a sci-fi movie like this. Noomi Rapace is a wonderful new (to me) actress whose role as Shaw is scientifically complex, incredibly brave and yet still childlike. Ms Rapace is very believable in all those aspects.  Other characters are not so well acted or created.  David the robot seems a bit too human, Miss Vickers should have stayed home along with her daddy.  The Captain is played well and is a big hero at the end.  The rest of the cast are forgotten and forgettable.  The biggest gaffe in the story line is when one of the 2 lost souls mistakes a seriously ugly and threatening cobra-like swamp creature for a teddy bear.  Big mistake.

The second group will go into great detail about what they perceived to be wrong with the film. In my view most of their stated ""plot holes"" are actually cases where they are not understanding the movie or the characters' motivations, (Except for the part where they were trying to outrun a rolling donut shaped object rather than just run to the side - that I admit was pretty dumb). After I watched it the first time a lot of it confused me so I went online to see what others thought and became convinced by the nay-sayers that it just wasn't a very well-written movie. Fast forward a year - after I had read up on some explanations of the more confusing parts of the movie by different people I felt compelled to watch it again.

As for the script, it begins to unravel as soon as the crew lands on the planet. Laughable and improbable choices by the characters sets the movie on a downward spiral from which it barely recovers to earn a borderline three-star rating. Another key problem is the casting of several of the actors, most notably Noomi Rapace as the lead.  She drags down the movie, coming across as whiny and annoying.  Unlike Sigourney Weaver, whom Ridley Scott cast as Ripley in Alien, Rapace lacks the charisma, strength and intelligence required of a lead to carry this type of movie.  These weaknesses are further exposed by the shakiness of most of the other actors (why Charlize Theron wasn't cast as the lead is a mystery. She would've elevated the movie). I'll see a sequel, if there is one, for Ridley Scott's masterful control of the lens than for Rapace's uneven acting.",1415318400,2,1019,4.734463276836158

Did I like this movie or not?  I can't decide!  The atmosphere is eerie, and the questions being raised are mysterious and philosophically profound - or at least they would be if they weren't being asked by characters who are all such unbelievable morons.  The ""science"" in this movie is AMAZINGLY bad.  Several points about the basic premise are flawed, but they could have been fixed with a minimum of effort.  It's almost like there is a good movie hiding in there somewhere; perhaps if I had some Black Goo to dip my DVD in, then after a proper incubation period some hidden, better version of itself would suddenly burst out ... the flaws confound me, because I thought Ridley Scott knew how to make movies, and it costs just as much to make a smart movie as it does to make a stupid one.  The images are beautiful to look at, but there's such a gloomy, oppressive, doomed feel to all of it.  Much to my chagrin, there are two gross-out horror scenes .. but both are so idiotic they are almost funny.

After watching this thing, I could not believe what I had seen.  I had to watch it again the next day just to make sure.  The second viewing resolved many of the issues I had with David's behavior (though his decision to spike the champagne is still preposterously reckless).  Nothing can redeem the rest of the crew.  These people do dumb things for no reason; their behavior is inconsistent as well as implausible.  Nobody in this movie acts like a real person would, and it totally ruined my suspension of disbelief.

Despite its nigh-cartoonish level of utter blithering stupidity, this movie still grabbed onto my brain.  I have spent more time thinking and talking about this movie than I have on anything else I've seen in the last 5 years.

The Scientist team are a bunch of young boo-boo heads, which is a miracle they even survived as long as they did. But do look at people we all have met in life who have some brilliance or another and yet in the practical world could get run over by a car without crossing the street and being in an enclosed space !! The special effects were great. The story line very possible and why not? It does explain the intelligence of the Alien creature that was mutated and how then the Alien trilogy was born etc. The one with Sirgourney Weaver.  If you like this kind of genre go ahead and watch it. But be warned you will have lots of questions after you're done. And if you have no tolerance for self centered, know it all genius types just skip it and rent something else. It gets two stars because I have a lot of questions and I do not see a sequel in the future that will answer them and I do not care for that!",1413849600,,1049,4.117073170731707

Story wise though, Prometheus falls short trying to rely on old tricks that Ridley developed in the original Alien, but without the actual Alien itself or the Alien storyline; and also without the creepy feeling of the original Alien. The overall effect was different but also a bit disappointing. That being said, Ridley Scott is an awesome director and his command of the visual aspects of film shine through in every shot of this movie and you spend the two hours looking at incredible images that help make listening to the actual story somewhat bearable.

4760858,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus 2 may help answer many of the open ended questions this movie introduces.  Still, this movie is more about a new unknown Alien species than it is about Xenomorphs who are hinted at in this movie and perhaps suggested to be some sort of biochemical weapon offspring.  Again, Prometheus 2 may help answer that.  Hope so.

That said, I think in the future respect for this movie is bound to grow.  Personally I don't care for some of the characters here but I guess you have to have a reason to go in search of this new race of aliens - so you have to give the film a little patience.

I feel this movie has some depth and has certainly been a cause for speculation and discussion.  Being a great fan of the original Alien film this movie could not be more welcome.

So, my take for the most part is that Prometheus is a very good sci fi movie that none-the-less frustrates most Alien fans because it does not answer the questions many fans hoped.",1412899200,,955,4.325842696629214

4760949,3,B005LAIHY0,"First, the good things.  A lot of money was poured into this movie, and the settings and special effects show that.  It is a wonder to behold and I didn't even see it in 3-D.  The equipment looks a tad too clean and advanced for the setting's time period but that could just be the fact that, in the story, trillions of dollars were put into the mission.
The bad.  The story was everything.  Character development or story details were tossed to one side, many important scenes edited out, to keep the story going.  Even characters were made to do stupid things to keep the plot moving.  And that is where the story, and the film, starts to fall apart.  The characters, who are meant to be highly intelligent scientists, the best of the best, do things even a kid would know better than to do on a alien planet.  True, I liked the character of David, the android, and Vickers, who the movie tried to paint as the evil suit, came across (at least for me) as somewhat realistic in her reactions and command decisions.
In the end, the characters kind of ruin the film, turning what could have been a good film into a so-so film.  Also, many of the questions asked, at least by people who went to watch this movie who were Alien fans, were not really answered.  The film is asking us the big questions about life, the universe, and everything.  Problem is, it has been done all before and, in most cases, by much better films, books, and even cartoons.
I would suggest renting it out if you were a fan of the Alien series.  Or a sci-fi fan in general.  If I was a HUG Alien fan, I feel I would have been more disappointed with the film and would have likely given it only a two or a one star rating.
The only reason is got three was is was so wonderful in many of the scenes.",1412553600,,1771,4.2477611940298505

4761469,1,B005LAIHY0,"This movie had some pretty cool special effects, but the character development and dialogue was just awful. I did not like a single character in the movie, and I am not sure why any of them acted, or spoke, the way that they did. I felt pretty misled by the exciting description of the movie and 4 star average review. There were several points that I actually laughed at how ridiculous some of the interaction was.

Also, the plot was just absolutely ridiculous. All of the ""explorers"" traveled two years to another planet where they have identified alien forms of life, that were responsible for the creation of humans, still exist, yet they are all for some reason grumpy and do not want to be there? I just cannot understand, if someone did not want to travel for two years into space to explore and reach another planet (something normal explorers would be more than stoked about), then why did they get on the freaking ship?

4761477,5,B005LAIHY0,"I usually don't write reviews but I am very fussy on movies. I've watched a lot of science fiction in my days and there is nothing worse than leaving a movie feeling you wasted 2 hours of your life you will never get back. There was a lot of hype about this movie and I'm a Alien/Aliens fan so I went to the movie thinking it would be like these movies which it is not. This is a more cerebral work which is was something not expected compared to the first two.

Pros:
Not a boring film. The plot keeps you involved through out with entertaining story line but there isn't a lot of action.
Casting is excellent. Everyone of the cast did a great job and the star Noomi Rapace whom I've never seen before did a great job in the film.
Special effects are excellent and stunning to see especially in HD.
Cleverly ties to Alien films but is its own work. Those who have seen the earlier Alien films well know what I'm talking about.

Cons:
Expectations were too high. This movie was setup to disappoint a portion of the audience. I went into the movie thinking it would be like one of early Alien films which it is not. Not a science fiction horror (Alien) or action (Aliens) film so many were disappointed. If your expecting that then you will probably not like it.",1410393600,,1261,4.294117647058823

4761718,2,B005LAIHY0,"Fans of the Alien series have been very harsh to Prometheus, and with some good reason. We get very little actual Alien for our money, the story gapes with plot holes as it fits with the original four movies, some of the character decisions are almost comically moronic (running from giant wheel, don't run sideways?), and on and on.

What can we say about Prometheus that it does well. Effects. These are flawless throughout. When we do see the alien (in all its carnations) it looks fantastic. The setting is atmospheric and breathtaking. Acting-wise, the movie does seem to lack. At times, everyone but the main character seems deserving of death. Another thing is the frankly stupid idea of a seeded human race. Nor sure if the makers wanted to attack theology using the crackpot Ancient Aliens theory, but whatever the case it all seemed goofball.

I give this movie two stars because the main actress is good, and the effects are generated to an Avatar-level of professionalism. As an Alien movie though, Prometheus misses the mark on way too many levels to be called a success.",1409702400,2,1084,4.791443850267379

This only has a mild connection to the Aliens films because it does place them in the same science-fiction universe.  And remember this is FICTION.  It's not meant to be fact. It's meant to be an entertaining and thought-provoking movie.  Which it is. And while the film presents us with many questions I feel that's the best basis for follow-up sequels.

4761811,5,B005LAIHY0,"I would normally give this 4 stars, 5 stars is a really hard standard for me on movies.  But I think a lot of people are treating it unfairly.  I haven't been riveted by a sci-fi movie like that in a very long time.  But I can see why some people feel confused or disappointed.  To me, I didn't set my expectations to be an ""alien prequel"", which probably many people did.  It was more of a movie with an ""alien teaser"".  But it was quite a cool story all by itself.

I thought the acting was overall, quite good. Things were grim at times, but also fascinating. My friend, who is an Aliens fan, told me this movie wasn't good, etc.  But the more he told me about the plot the more interested I became in it.  I'm glad I ignored his advice not to watch it, because it was great for me.  Everybody's different, and one man's sci-fi is often another man's garbage.  But to me this was pretty damn good.  As I said, I haven't been that drawn into a sci-fi movie in a very long time.

There are some loose ends in the story.  And thank goodness for that.  Movies that tie up everything in a bow for you are BORING.  There is no other word for it.  Using your imagination to fill in a few blanks here and there is what good sci-fi movies are all about.  And I dare say the richer your imagination, the better the story will be for you.

Yes you can pick holes in the story like you can with ANY Hollywood movie.  This story is head and shoulders above most other Hollywood sci-fi movies I've seen in the last 5 years.  I was bored to tears by Inception, and that movie got fantastic ratings.  But that story was completely ridiculous and unfeasible in every way.  But it's got good mainstream approval.  Which tells you how much that matters.

Bottom line, if you like sci-fi and don't have preconceived notions about what this movie ""should"" be about, then watch it. Don't listen to the critics or the malcontents.  If you are curious about this movie like I was, just watch it!  You will not regret it.  This is 2 hours of your life that you won't regret spending.",1409011200,,2061,4.242268041237113
4761812,1,B005LAIHY0,"It's like (Vatican) Catholic insanity to make members of the Vatican Catholic church run around killing the Iraq and Egyptian races from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, to, Nigeria, Brazil, Gambia, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Vietnam, Korea, etc. While there they are tricking people into smashing the Temples because the ""Ptah Stone"" and the inventors of the Genesis chapter 2 Faith would be offended by what the Vatican has mutilated ancient wisdom into.

The Alien First race in this movie is representative of the Body and Figure on Narmer's Palette. Vatican Catholics have had Free & Accepted Mason at the British Museum teaching people these are grinding stones and not the same thing Moses stole and presented the Commandments on. Genesis 2 is on a stone credited to Ptah, where this evil trick of lying coached someone into using the stone as a Speculative Mason Pick hammer grinding stone.

The Ancients and Creators bear no ill will. But Vatican Catholics out falsely to portray them as monsters to protect the Vatican's income.

Cheops 146 foot Ocean Yachts were found next to the Pyramids in 1953. In 1954 the ""Knights of Columbus"" a Vatican order in the United States declared Ji'had=G'od using US Pledge of Alliegace, and then in 1956 US paper Money. Give unto Caeser? Guess what the Vatican has grown to 25% of the United States = Census.gov then search ""Religion"".

The 1st three Talmud were written in Iraq, Palestine, and Syria. Starting in 1004 AD the Vatican broke from the Chalcedon Council of 425 AD and changed of the of Aramaic Elah to Ji'had=G'od this starting the Crusades that continue even to this day hidden in the shaping of news and entertainment to culture the minds of people to infuriate and offend the originals without people knowing the word G'od=Ji'had.

The compilers of the Torah, Tanakh, Talmud, Mishnah, Midresh and Iisou/Jesus Faith are the Aramaika (Aramaic). The Vatican used a group of people in the Alps on the borders of Italy to culture a Yiddish into forming a Hebraice people to imitate and replace the original races of Adam Even & Abraham. Basically genocide the people of the Holy Lands and Fertile Crescent so that the myth of 1948 Israel exists in place of those ancients redacted by CIA and United Nations wars.

I apologize if this seems unbelievable. But Depleted Uranium is Nuclear Waste, and Nuclear Waste is what we have been bombing Iraq With. But whatever forces shaped the writing of this story. Religion and an insane desire to destroy the Ancients is the punchline of the plot.

Other than the android, David, the characters are worthless and I couldn't care less about them.  He was the only one that was semi believable and actually had purpose.  I also want to point out that Michael Fassbender did a terrific job.  The rest?  Well, whenever a movie has to rely on stupid characters doing stupid things to advance a plot, you know you are in trouble.  You would think with a ship full of scientists and doctors, that you might see some common sense.  Nope. It was a waste of the talents of Idris Elba and Charlize Theron. Nuff said. Then there are the plot holes.  Big and numerous enough to drive a starship through.  It seems that someone might have put some effort toward the big picture (future films), but that remains to be seen.  This current story?  Uh, no.  There are so many things that don't make any sense that I don't know where to begin.  The quick rundown is that scientists have found strong evidence of aliens that had some important part of our evolution.  They call them the ""Engineers"". They even decode where they actually are.  They take a 2-year journey to this planet to investigate.  From that point on, the movie is as predictable as you can possibly imagine.

Now, I don't want to say it's completely bad.  There are a few scenes at the beginning and end that are pretty darn good.  Any scenes with the Engineers were interesting (but unfortunately brief).  Those characters could have changed my opinion of the movie if they had more development.

4762059,1,B005LAIHY0,"There's little I can add to Arthur Bullock's great review, but since I just read that a sequel is scheduled for release in 2016, it can't hurt to write another one star review just in case the people who make idiotic movies like this one are influence by our generally collective rejection of stupid movies--a movie which supposedly deals with important issues like our origins and which follows the brilliant Alien and very entertaining Alien 2.

What I will add, which adds to the general stupidity, is that the crew is generally composed of annoying and irritable people who are constantly arguing.  Is it asking to much to expect that for an expedition like this one, crew members would have been screened to assure that they don't have personality characteristics would result in constant problems with others on the ship? So instead of watching a supposedly important movie in which you'd expect the crew to be focusing on important things, we get to watch adults acting like children.  Also, of all the stupidity here, it was especially ridiculous that upon seeing the first sign of intelligent life, the geologist storms off, angry because he's just interested in rocks.  And lastly, with 20 minutes left to go, I walked out of the theater, not because of the inanity, but because of boredom.  For some reason, I tried to watch it again a few months ago.

4762173,4,B005LAIHY0,"First at all: this film is not at the level of Alien or Blade runner. But who cares about?

Two: You should consider the elapsed years between Alien, Blade runner and this entry: 30 years or six generations of movie buffs.

Three: I think the clue turns around Prometheus as its mythical significance: the epitome of being the broker-rules, who stole the fire of the Gods in order to give life to men. And I think to myself this aspect is the key of the movie. Weyland (A wealthy and old man; it's to say a God in decay) wants inmortality. That explains why he finnacies the long journey.

Four: Scott makes of this entry a well deserved homage to previous gems of Sci-Fi such as 2001, Alien itself (Watch for the narrow resemblance of the Aliens), but mostly Invasion of the body snatchers (The best sci film of the fifties).

So, in order these facts, the movie achieves its goal. And smartly, Scott leaves opened a sequel.

P.D. The major flaw of the film to my mind resides in this detail: if Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is pregnant with an Alien inside of her, I can't buy why she wasn't totally contaminated, keeping into account his husband died because of it.

But nobody will be able to deny you will be entertained with suspense and fine touches of fine irony along these 120 min. running.",1407628800,2,1290,4.468085106382978

So you settled down with a bottle of wine expecting to see just how good this good SciFi would be.
And it turned out to be bad. Not just ""not quite as good as Alien"" but BAD.

Prometheus was obviously envisioned as a place-holder film, kicking the can down the road probably for budgetary reasons and therefore diluting a grand vision originally inspired by Carl Sagan. I can see and hear the studio execs saying, ""no no, take a hundred mil off the budget, but don't make it too boring"".

Ick factors the teens might like but been there, done that one too many times. comes with age, i guess. or maybe it tries to tell too much when collapsing the story around a few less characters might have helped. i get the dna seeding sequence at the start with an actor that out-body builds the body builders instead of the alligator handbag aliens contactees claim to have met. Straight out of H2s Ancient Aliens series, sans charm. wonderfully realized alien architecture stuffed with a lot of slimy, crawly things, to be expected. Now this is an eleven alarm line up of acting talent that couldn't seem to find footing. ordinarily i am a Ridley Scott fan but this may be a case of overthinking the project. details overwhelm and everything stalls. considering his film stand on robots i am caused to wonder if he wasn't frightened by a ventriloquist's dummy sometime in the past. no spoilers. if you love sci-fi as an art form, you'll love it, it is artistically, well realized. but there is some human aspect, some hint of suffering or empathy beyond sheer recoiling horror that's missing. i always look for the touches that humanize a film. a flaw in my nature. therefore 5 stars for what was attempted, 2 for what resulted, to average it out at 3. a well crafted ""Huh?""",1407283200,,1540,4.576086956521739

Oh, you might want to make sure you're up to date on your Masonic culture as well, as ENGINEERS in the movie are parallel to THE GRAND ARCHITECHT that Masons tend to have faith in.

4762675,4,B005LAIHY0,"For those who have listed innumerable ""complaints and hates""  of this movie, then you cannot *possibly* understand the SciFi GENRE.

Those who (ever) expect answers from any story, book or movie, will never understand this format simply because SciFi was never intended to SUPPLY answers, it was designed, by the original writers (HG Wells, Jules Verne, among many, many others) to ""IMAGINE a different future"" (usually) in opposition to the year, decade, century or millennia that they themselves feel trapped within.

In addition, the writers DID hope to entertain with their stories by putting them in print, but because the writers were, and still are, living in a time where men are killing each other over words, space, religions and so forth, it was NOT necessary for the reader to understand the writers' depth of happiness or despair.

This is the origin of SciFi. The writer asks YOU to come with him on the journey, but it is still HIS story; your belief is NOT mandatory.

In other words, what ever made all those haters think that this movie was made for a Facebook audience? Ridley Scott did NOT come inside YOUR house, on your computer, so, by extension, I'm sure he cares as much as a book writer does when someone dislikes a book he's published.

As a major fan of SciFi that DOES understand the genre, I happened to think this movie was a MINIMUM of 4-stars and I can't WAIT for the next movie, which will explain the gap BETWEEN Prometheus and the Alien of 1979 (which I also happened to have seen as an adult) so personally, if you just graduated from high school in the last 5 or 6 years, or haven't yet, you need to spend time with your nose inside of actual books or actual literature before condemning this movie as ""sucky because there aren't any answers!""

These stories were made to supply the (originally, reader, and now the gamer and movie-goer) with QUESTIONS.

The ""Answer"" was NEVER intended to be a character in any SciFi story!

All answers (if indeed there ARE any!) are not supplied because it is left up to the ""reader"" (and his/her friends) to find OUT what the writer meant, and to ""thrash out"" any possible solutions for the reader to determine.

To HATE a movie because it doesn't supply the ""answers you were expecting"" is the same as hating on ACTUAL science because you can't figure out the math!

4762851,4,B005LAIHY0,"Wonderful picture quality but it is the deleted scenes which help make this disc worth getting.  They and the commentary are very revealing.  In fact, several of them probably should have been kept in the movie to help explain things a bit while others that were kept could/should have been trimmed or deleted.  And, the nastiest gore and violence could have been toned down to better effect (like Alien did so well) without losing any of its impact.  It'd be interesting to see this movie modestly re-edited

Overall, this is a really great looking movie that tries really hard to be mysterious and thoughtful, but instead ends up as much too vague and far-fetched in places.  We WANT to learn more about the engineers and why they want to kill their most successful creation.  But, instead we learn nothing new at all except they really don't seem to like us, even 2000 years later, and ironically they may have destroyed themselves trying to do so.

Was it a Mission to Mars type? Kind of but not quite. I probably need to re-watch it again for a better review.  For now I will simply call it A L I E N 1979 remade for 2014. It's a very good Science Fiction/horror type flick. Maybe I will edit this later. The reason for no 5 stars is because it's kind of/sort of the same stuff we have all seen before but with better modern tech and things like that. Plus very confusing messages on life.

Witnessing the design concept drawings is always a thrill and Scott has included a lot of stuff and that's what I was hoping for and I got what I paid for.  How many directors care about intelligence and detail as much---not many? No, let's get blockbuster profits, that's the main reason for making movies.  Maybe the directors has to be a little older.  You know, for me, just a few years later and the innovation of let's say, Avatar, is obvious. But the story, the detail, the sense of it all, the message overtakes all that and the message has been heard since the days of Christ and began again in the sixties.

Its been stated that the events in the first Alien movie would have happened whether or not the events in Prometheus took place.  In fact the planet in Prometheus is a completely different one then that which is in the first Alien movie.  My guess is that Alien through Alien: Resurrection are one story-line from the Alien universe, and that Prometheus is the beginning of a completely different story-line from the same universe.  However, this movie does help to answer many questions (even if it presents 2 questions for every answer!).  If you're looking for a good 3D too, this one is pretty good.

4763178,4,B005LAIHY0,The price was very good on this. The movie plot is a little lame because these people are supposed to be professionals but they are just screwing around the whole time. It makes it hard to root for the people because their characters are so lame. Why would some guy see an alien and start playing with it and talking to it like a baby after witnessing some unknown horrors? Why would a supposed professional take an unnecessary risk with his space suit in a alien environment? Lame. I wish the characters were more developed and likable. Also I wish that it was a bit darker with nudity and more gore. More gore for more impact and nudity for a further portrayal or frailty or vulnerability. Its supposed to be a space horror movie but it seems a little lite on the horror or seriousness. Some movies should be mature movies. If they decide to be then why not go all the way? This one should have been one. I'm not sure what pushed this to a rated R because it seems pretty tame and normal compared to other movies and shows out there.

That said, I did not sit down to a Ridley Scott film expecting to need much of my frontal lobe. People that responded poorly to this film have done no better than the bad characters in the film itself. Expecting a well thought out composition from him makes about as much sense as shooting yourself in the leg and then complaining about the pain.

This thing is a fire works display. Your role is entirely passive. Gawk at the scale of it. Look at the pretty pictures.

4763186,2,B005LAIHY0,"The story has an interesting plot potential and would have been quite enjoyable had it not been for the poor casting and brain-dead science in the screenplay. The special effects were quite good. Each individual actor had talent, but they were just not placed in an appropriate vehicle. Noomi Rapace was great in Girl With A Dragon Tattoo, but as a scientist she just falls flat. Her scientist/lover comes across more like an immature surfer-dude than a chief interstellar investigator. Charlize Theron seemed to be playing a caricature of the evil company woman, who's overall role is really not quite clear. The captain of the ship would have been right at home in some gritty inner city crime drama, but piloting a high-tech vessel? I think not. And don't get me started with the tattooed, mohawk-sporting, ill-tempered ""geologist"" who apparently undertook a multi-year interstellar voyage strictly ""for the money"". And of course there is the bumbling idiotic ""biologist"" who is, well, deathly afraid of biological things (except the truly scary evil snake things).
When the ship arrives at the ""undisclosed location"" planet and the crew is thawed out, it seems that its time to party and the booze begins to flow.
Also silly happenings like the lead scientist inexplicably removing his space helmet and letting out a wolf-call in the alien structure because ""the CO2 levels are OK now"". Who cares about things like alien spores, molds, fungus, bacteria, viruses, toxic gasses etc.  that might just be floating around in the air, not to mention the aliens who might be awoken by the shouting.

50 years before A L I E N (1979), on the Earth-like planet, Theshold, a UFO hovers over a raging river. A man, a humanoid (Ian Whyte), with very fair, young and smooth skin, appears next to the river. He opens an orb, which is a bowl of something. He drinks it as if it is an offering. The liquid suddenly changes him. It damages his DNA and begins to disintegrate him.  The UFO leaves vertically. The man, in pain, falls into the river and his body breaks apart. He was the last Engineer. The DNA is in the water.
  Now, we go to the year 2089 on the Isle of Scotland. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) has found something while clearing rock. It is an opening of a tunnel leading to a cave. She shows Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). On the cave wall are hand prints from a dye and other drawings. One drawing shows a person pointing at a configuration in the sky. The configuration is one that Shaw and Holloway are familiar with. It is of 5 stars.
 Now, we go to December 21, 2093.  On the Scientific exploratory vessel, Prometheus, are 17 crew members. Inside, they have a big area for recreation for basketball. They can watch movies like Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and play billiards.  David (Michael Fassbender) gets the crew out of sleep hibernation of 2 years. The vessel has reached their destination.
  At the meeting, a hologram of Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce), the CEO of the Weyland Corporation, instructs the crew. Then Elizabeth and Holloway explain the drawing they found in the cave in 2089, the same drawing found on other famous tablets of stone found. The configuration is a galactic system with a planet and a sun. Now they have arrived at the planet, Theshold. What they find on this planet is incredible and dangerous.

Also in the cast: Charlize Theron, Sean Harris, Rafe Spall, Emun Elliott, Benedict Wong, Kate Dickle.

Yep.

It's written by people who clearly never met a scientist, or even a moderately intelligent human being. It plays like Scott forgot everything he knew about filmmaking thirty years earlier. Maybe someday he will release a four-hour director's cut that: explains why all the scientists are such imbeciles; fills in some of the mammoth plot holes; gives us at least a little bit of reason to care about any of the characters; and provides some kind of logical motivation for the whole preposterous exercise.

Prometheus is truly one of the WORST movies ever made, for several thousand different reasons (the list grows the more you think about it, leaving you tongue tied just trying to spit them all out).

The movie has hokey octopus like rubber monsters, horrible CGI humanoids,  scientists who say things like "" I have no evidence but I believe it's true"", silly cliched characters, and a story that is worse than a marvel comic on the big screen.  The featured ship ""Prometheus"" looks like a transformer, the script has conventional science completely wrong, even including 30,000 year old Altamira cave paintings supposedly in Scotland dated only 5,000 years ago, the research done for the film was so bad, it is impossible to suspend disbelief.  Not sure where Ridley Scott was going with this one. I am normally a big fan of his, but this film was utter garbage, and so incredibly illogical, with a terrible plot full of holes.  I am sure there are some die hard fans who are going to claim it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, But being of the age where I got to see Alien in the theaters in 1979, I can say this- if you are a fan of the original, do not bother with Prometheus.

4763552,5,B005LAIHY0,"I rarely write about movies but ""Prometheus"" is a special case, for it manages to capture both the horror and the utter magic of the original ""Alien,"" also directed by Ridley Scott.  Comparing other science fiction/horror films to ""Alien"" has always been a lopsided contest, because ""Alien"" is IT, a match-grade alloy of verisimilitude and ""Oh f--- this can't be happening!"" ""Aliens"" came pretty close but the subsequent films lacked that naked, burning curiosity I felt watching the original.

""Prometheus"" gives you plenty to wonder about and also passed my acid test for a good yarn: I woke up the next day still thinking about it.  Fans overly loyal to ""Alien"" want this film to be exactly like it; that's not only impossible but unfair to both pieces.  ""Prometheus"" explores the same universe as the original without compromising its integrity.

The dumbest scientists who ever lived convince a zillionaire to fund the construction of an interstellar ship, based on some pictures they find in caves.  Once they get to the planet, they immediately make the most incomprehensible judgements and undertake actions that the average 6 year old could tell you were a bad idea.  If you are a Michael Fassbender fan, you're in for a treat, as he plays an android modeling himself on Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (at least I think that's what the movie he was watching was).

When I watched her I felt like I was watching a liitle kid, especially in her disjointed walking and running scenes. Not very graceful. Overly dramatic.  I truly believe that Ridley Scott needed to get someone tall and of Sigourney Weaver's style to give justice to that role. I did not like Charlize Theron in her part. There are bad guys I love to hate but she wasn't even worthy of loving to hate. Just sincere dislike. Very disappointed with the soundtrack. It wasn't very haunting and sounded like something they came  up with very quickly because they were pressed for time. That was my number one disappointment. The movie did not come close to ALIEN, ALIENS AND ALIEN RESSURECTION.

4763703,1,B005LAIHY0,"PROMETHEUS (2012) was supposed to be the next sci-fi masterpiece with groundbreaking special effects. What went wrong? Same thing that usually goes wrong with many a film today: too much focus on effects, not enough on character or story. This less-than-stellar film was directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, which makes it that more disappointing. ""Prometheus"", in a roundabout way, is a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, pre-dating Scott's classic 1979 film. Ironically, the last major sci-fi offering was ""Avatar"", made by James Cameron, who directed the first ""Alien"" sequel ""Aliens"" and it was much better received than ""Prometheus"", although there have been many complaints about ""Avatar's"" unoriginal story. But somehow, that film transcended the detractors. Scott's ""Prometheus"" could not. And it's all-too-apparent why. Except for the effects, this is pretty much an awful movie in EVERY possible way: lazy storytelling, odd dialogue, poor characterization, bad acting (mostly due to the odd dialogue!). The film has a self-important aura that's undeniable. The movie tries unsuccessfully to explain the origins of man in a manner in which, frankly, could have been told better by a grade-schooler!

""Prometheus"" asks more questions than it answers. And that's fine since we are talking about the beginning of life as we know it, and that should be a mystery. But the questions this movie asks are as abstract, vague and open-ended as can be! In this movie, everything is left up in the air. The film says that an alien race, called ""Engineers"", created life on Earth as we know it, then for some unknown reason in the 21st century decides that the human race must be annihilated. The characters, consisting mostly of ""scientists"", spends the film's entirety not really doing anything scientific, logical, or that even begins to TRY to answer any questions! Virtually everything the scientists and crewmembers do is a detriment to the mission, not an enhancement. In particular, the 2 scientists, who in my opinion, should be the MOST important to the mission, a geologist and a biologist, literally don't care anything about it and spend their limited screen time acting like scared, clueless buffoons. They don't do anything ""scientific"". The nominal mission leader, the corporate lady Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) tells the 2 archaelogists whose discovery on Earth even led to the mission happening that they can't ""talk to"" the aliens. What does this even mean? She doesn't even believe that there's anything on the planet worth discovering, so why even tell them something like this? It's like the character knows what's happening before it's supposed to happen. So you would think Vickers knows something. She doesn't! She's completely clueless throughout. There are other instances like this where character actions and dialogue almost seem to illogically preface the actual turn of events. The script-writers really didn't proofread their own material!

The actual star of the film is Naomi Rapace (never heard of her), who plays archaelogist Shaw, but she is apparently acclaimed from several foreign films, and Scott does her character no favors. Shaw has a chemistry-lacking love story with the other archaelogist Holloway (played by Logan Marshall-Green, never heard of him either). We are to accept them as an already-established couple, but the flat dialogue undermines them, as well as the rest of the cast, boasting several talented and acclaimed actors, most notably the aforementioned Theron (an Oscar-winner!), Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, and Michael Fassbender (who plays the android David, by default the best and most interesting character of the film). David is supposed to be an android, but he has an all-too-obvious ""Data"" vibe (from Star Trek:TNG). He at times seems too ""human"" to be convincing and he does an inordinately amount of head-scratching things in the movie. In fact, every single character does something that makes no sense. EVERY one of them! Elba plays Captain Janek, whose sole responsibility is ensuring everyone's safety and he has an pretentious cowboy quality about him. Not sure who Elba is emulating in this weird performance. Pearce for some reason is in old-man makeup for the entire film. I was waiting for the scene where the Engineers would reverse the life-cycle and make him young again. Never happened!

Perhaps the biggest violation of ""Prometheus"" is in it's not-so-subtle and confusing ties to ""Alien"". Not really a direct prequel per se, the film still has to be connected somehow as the ship that the crew finds on the planet is similar to the one found in ""Alien"", with the Engineers seeming to be from the same species as the space jockey from ""Alien"", and finally a revelation at the end that would reveal that ""Prometheus"" MUST be connected to ""Alien"". But, again, many more questions have popped up now than have been answered. It makes what's going on in ""Alien"" all the more confusing. And THAT is a huge violation as ""Alien"" is a masterpiece that doesn't deserve to be tainted by this awful film!",1401753600,2,5082,5.165048543689321

4763817,3,B005LAIHY0,"Aliens sure have some amazing DNA. When the movie begins a human-like alien, outside a giant spaceship, ingests some squirmy material filling up a small tin. Immediately he begins to dissolve - falling into a waterway where he completely disintegrates. This is intended to show the origins, if not of all life on Earth, then the origins of man. This image might be closer to something out of Revelations than to actual science? Later in the film, one of the Aliens loses a fight to the death with another (seemingly primitive) blob-like alien, and his dead body is impregnated by its larva or eggs. When the youngling hatches out of the Aliens body it is a small, boy-sized Alien of the type from the first four movies. The films have come full circle. We've now seen the origin of the 'Aliens'. During the film it's revealed that the humanoid-aliens have DNA that is a match for human. But somehow it's more amazing. OK. All part of the amazing, and frightening power of DNA. This should also mean aliens are part human.

The human-aliens, by their appearance, look a little bit like cartoons and not realistic like the 'Predator' aliens from earlier movies, or even the Aliens of the earlier films. The spaceships and visuals look nice (aside from the human-aliens); the film has some amazing footage. Then there are terrible scenes such as one showing a dimly lit room with menacing looking canisters that the film cuts back to over and over. The spaceships look nice, and then one of their moon buggies, or land rovers they could be called, looks half out of a scene from Mad Max with strapped together technology. I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt, thinking the bland and drab scenes (and dumb scenes) were included to make the scenes following them look that much more impressive, and that they are. Prometheus is an impressive film, with just too many 'flaws' to ignore.

There's a great, funny, scene in the movie where two scientists (stranded in an alien cave or building) are notified that there are alien life forms near; near, but not moving. They say, 'we're going in the opposite direction', 'the decorations on the walls look like something out of the holocaust'. Later, these same two discover an alien life-form and play with it like a pet until it kills them. Very Dumb. This change-up adds up to a big let-down for the viewer. You know we're trying to take this film seriously.

To its credit, this film embraces the earlier Alien vs Predator film (I liked that film). At least it embraces the aliens vs aliens while humans pass by theme. It also seems similar to that film in that much of it also takes place in a strange, foreign, cramped space. Something about Prometheus may have reminded me of the film Event Horizon (which I liked too).

What this film does well explain it's plot, or the larger meanings to the actions, without in any way simply telling us. The robot mentions, ""this is a cargo bay""  (and we have to assume the robot knows more than anyone) and by hearing the captain of the Prometheus say things like, ""This is a military installation"", and a bit, perhaps, by intuition, we learn that this group of human-aliens were intending to return to Earth to destroy us, and they were killed by other aliens. When the only surviving human-alien is revived, he escapes, intending to piloting his ship to Earth to complete his mission. Why the human-alien's civilization hasn't bothered to investigate the silence coming from this military installation (has it been days or thousands of years?) or even independently completed this mission, is a good question.

What this film also does well is portray the robot accompanying the crew. So many of these Sci Fi movies have had these robot characters or automated intelligence's and this may have been the best one yet. The intelligence the AI seems to have, combined with his humor at the troubles of humans really is done effectively. Alas, near the end of the film, when the AI has a conversation with the human-alien the crew have awoken, it immediately walks up to him and then tears his head off. The lone human survivor of the film rescues his head, and then these two make-off for a new adventure at the end. To me, for a tiny moment when these two survivors were together, it is almost sexual. Perhaps more humor than sex. And that could be because I've seen a scene like this before, one where a young Sci Fi fan, and his girlfriend, who is now just a face on a board, more or less, are the fitting survivors of a parody episode of another the scifi show, Dr. Who. It was an incredible episode. If a small half-moment in this film was influenced, or a nod to this Dr. Who episode, I don't know. Maybe it's just me. The Sci Fi film 'Jason X' had a similar love affair between a spaceman and a female robot - a robot who also loses her head. The be-smitten man carries it around for the rest of Jason X. He presumably intends to give her a new body. I liked Jason X, too. I think I liked all these movies I'm mentioning a little more than Prometheus.

Most of the reviews that I'd previously skimmed, suggest the aliens want to kill us mostly because they can. The AI (and remember he is really smart) suggests instead the aliens created us (the same reason we created him) because they can. Prometheus actually suggests the aliens want to kill us because they are afraid of us. The movie suggests more than once that the young desire to kill the old. In one scene a character says, ""doesn't everyone want to kill their parents""? The captain of the ship tells her aging father, ""Just die"". This idea was given quite an emphasis, and it's unlikely coincidental, in this film about us meeting our makers, our parents, in a sense. If this idea itself is true, if people have a secret desire to see their parents die, or outdo them, I have no idea. The idea that the human-aliens may be afraid of us . . . I don't think this idea is out in the open. I don't think it is meant to be picked up by the conscious mind. I think it is an idea meant for our unconscious. It would seem unlikely such a complex inference would be picked up by our unconscious mind but perhaps they've discovered our unconscious mind is more intelligent than our conscious mind. It may be. If this idea is being quietly explored or instilled, could presenting such an idea be intended to increase support for something like the space program? There are many reasons in this universe we have to be afraid.

The ship's captain was my favorite (of the human characters) but it turns out she's a villain of sorts in the film. The actual (human) hero is really, really, impressive. I wonder if her body is done in part by some kind of 'CGI' affects. To tell the truth, I was thinking about this ladies image and type a while after this film was over. This might be a good time to write another paragraph or two exploring the AI in the film, but, I'm out.

A reviewer on a racist website denounced this movie saying the white people are all portrayed as bad guys and the people of color all sacrifice themselves to save humanity. These are often the same people who always say that 'Hollywood' produces nothing but sin and racism against whites'. If this is true, having the (normal) roles reversed, shouldn't Prometheus be like manna from heaven for them? I might have posted such a comment to the 'racist' review but I've only just seen the movie. That's not to say they may not have a point of some kind, or another kind of point. Or some kind of point. It's a complex issue. And what about those who have disdain for the racists, those who have a normal view, or even those who have a view that Hollywood is a racist (of the normal kind) hotbed, and that the entertainment industry has been nothing but disparaging to women and people of color (there was even a college lecture series by that name a couple of decades ago titled 'women, minorities and the media')? Someone claiming that Hollywood has been unfair to white women and men of color. . . ? Well, we needn't listen to anything else they would say for the rest of their lives. To help make sure they never again hold positions of power or influence, write their names down.",1400803200,,8202,4.529014844804318

This review is based on Amazon Prime rental.

I enjoyed Prometheus the first time I watched it but like a lot of people, I just didn't understand some of it. After reading about some of the things that confused me and thinking about it some I decided to watch it again.

Parts I still didn't like:
- all parts with the geologist and biologist. Two wasted characters in my mind. A company spends a trillion dollars on a ship, you can make an assumption that they are going to find the best scientists around and that are motivated to be there. The geologist doesn't want to be there at all and can't wait to get back to the ship. Lame. The biologist is an equally worthless, underdeveloped character that is too stupid to not interact with a alien creature that is obviously not timid, and more importantly, wasn't there the last time they were in the 'vase' room. They got what they deserved.
- as many others have commented on, trying to outrun a crashing ship behind you is almost comical. Moments later we see Dr Shaw roll a couple of times to dodge the ship after she trips. It was that easy. Lame
- couple other things I won't get into.

Good things:
- The special effects are awesome (except for trying to outrun a crashing ship); the space craft are well done, the set in the 'vase room' is pretty neat, etc.
- all scenes with the big alien. The fight scene with the tentacled creature is f'n amazing and worth watching a couple times.
- at the end of the movie are some deleted scenes that are quite good. One is a brief conversation with the alien they wake up before it goes homicidal. Why they cut that out I have no idea as those few seconds add a tremendous amount to that scene. Another is a longer scene when the alien and Dr Shaw are together after the crash and before the tentacle fight.

I could go on and on. I did expect more but was not as disappointed as others seem to be. It is a miss from Alien quality that's for sure but I still enjoyed it. 'Enhanced' will definitely make it more enjoyable.  I do hope they release a directors cut that has all the good stuff they cut out, I would buy it.",1400544000,2,2141,4.276543209876543

I already paid for it again so I might as well watch, which I am doing while writing this review because the movie has nothing to sustain my interest. The more I watch, the more I remember how bad this movie is. It is full of cliches, not an original thought in the whole film. I am amazed that any actor in this film went on to better roles. I will be amazed if the directors ever make a better film. This is a new breed of film making, films so un-rememberable that you rent them twice.

Below is a followup on my original review.

My appologies to the Ridley Scott. He has directed movies that I consider to be the best of our time. I will never forget watcthing Alien in the theater. It remains the only movie that I could feel my heart pounding while watching. If I were a movie buff then I would definitely remember his name.

When I saw Prometheus, I assumed Hollywood had thrown it together to capitalize on the SciFi market using a director merely capable in special effects. The dialog and concepts were so cliche that this movie borderlined on comedy. Maybe it was a serious attempt by Ridley Scott to explain the origins of Alien or maybe Mr. Scott simply loaned his name to the movie. Unfortunately, my original ill-informed comment about the directors going on to make a better movie might hold true. It must be nearly impossible for Ridley Scott to make better movies than he already has.",1399593600,6,1538,4.408450704225352

I generally don't watch a movie more than once unless I love it. Well, this is one of those that you (in my opinion) need to watch at least 2 times to pick up on some of the hidden directions this thing is going in.

Who were those aliens who created the derelict spacecraft from the original Alien movie? On the other hand, that unanswered question was probably the best part of that classic. It created an atmosphere of mystery for the story to unfold. Prometheus answers that question and sadly, it does it in the most shallow and careless way possible. What's worse, the movie shows us how humans got here too and that question is given a whopping one minute of air time. I mean seriously, if you're going to address that subject, come up with something creative and thought-provoking.

The movie takes what could have been the best parts of the movie and tosses them aside to create just the latest installment of the Alien franchise. I enjoyed the Alien action, but it could have been so much better with some added depth.",1395878400,,901,4.738853503184713

4765048,4,B005LAIHY0,"This is a good movie, well-paced, with lots of action and stellar special effects (the holographic cosmos is especially impressive). The only problem with it is that it should have been the first in the Alien series, not the fourth. Watching it now is like watching a recording of the first half of a football game when you've already watched the second half and know the result. It may be a great half of football, but it doesn't hold the interest as it would if the second half was yet to come. If you haven't seen Alien and its two sequels yet (and there's a new generation for whom that might well be the case), watching this movie first will whet your appetite for the others. If you have seen Alien already, this movie is good, but not as jaw-dropping as Alien was when it hit the screen.

4765122,3,B005LAIHY0,"This prequel to Alien attempts to outline what happened prior to the Nostromo receiving the signal that proved so fatal to its crew a few decades after the Prometheus mission takes place. The film's opening shot traverses a stunning landscape until we reach the edge of a raging torrent of a river that plunges into a mammoth water fall. Here we see a hooded humanoid figure walk to the water's edge and consume the liquid contents of, what looks to be, a steel sphere-like object that obviously doesn't agree with the humanoid as we find out in spectacular fashion.

Cut to the Outer Hebrides in 2089 as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an archeologist, is hacking away at a mountainside and discovers a cave full of what appear to be ancient paintings depicting, amongst other things, a scene in which a very large figure is pointing to a constellation in the night sky. We then find out that very similar images have been found in various other places on the Earth all dating from its pre-history, which means, of course, that the artists could never have met and exchanged information. Shaw, and her boyfriend/collaborator, Dr. Charlie Holloway (the improbably named Logan Marshall-Green), convince Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke who looks like Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke), the decrepit head of the Weyland corporation, that they have discovered a race of beings, who we come to know later as the `Engineers', and it was they who created Homo Sapiens, us! Weyland, who appears to have at least 1.999 feet in the grave, is desperately keen to make contact with the engineers thinking that, if he can have a chat with his maker(s) he might achieve some form of immortality.

Cut to a team meeting in the spacecraft Prometheus addressed by Weyland, Shaw and Holloway in which the team are apprised of their destination; the aforementioned constellation that comprises a star with a planet with an Earth-like satellite; the apparent `home' of the engineers. The team comprises the `usual (united nations) suspects'; a nerdy biologist, an anti-social, bordering on sociopathic, geologist played hammingly to the hilt by a typecast Sean Harris and various examples of grunt muscle sporting mammoth machine gun type weapons, etc. All of this is presided over by an ice queen bitch, Charlize Theron, who plays Meredith Vickers who, we subsequently learn, has her own very special reasons for being involved.

The plus points are the look of the whole thing which has brilliant production design. The movie credits H. R. Giger, rightly, as it's look, once we've returned to the Engineer's ship, is heavily influenced by his original artwork.

The score, by German composer, Marc Streitenfeld, is also moderately impressive and even manages to feature a smidgeon of the original Jerry Goldsmith score for Alien, but lacks the latter's lyrical beauty and its insidious power to get under the skin of the listener to convey convincingly the sheer otherworldliness of the alien landscape that the Nostromo's crew encounters.

The performances are fine with Michael Fassbender's subtly invidious robot, David, and Idris Elba's ship's captain highlights (although why he has to be American is anyone's guess).

However, there is virtually no originality on show anywhere: this is sheer derivation albeit, in places, self-derivation some examples of which are:

Guy Pearce's Peter Weyland looks like 2001's elderly Dave Bowman; Peter Weyland's talk mirrors his relative/namesake, Charles Bishop Weyland's talk to his team in Alien vs Predator during which the same plot point re: the cave images is made; the Prometheus crew members' space suits look as if they have been directly `lifted' from the original Tron; the ground team attempt to make the same stupid mistake and bring a contaminated individual back into the ship; the robot, David, is the same amoral corporate toady as is Ash in Alien and Elizabeth Shaw, who appears to be an expert in everything (including making luxury chocolates?) initiates the feisty female role later reprised by the Nostromo's third officer, Ripley; Shaw is impregnated as is Ripley later at the end of Aliens; the seemingly natural mineral `covering' of the alien ship is revealed by the hurricane to have a statuesque Mount Rushmore type face sculpted into it very reminiscent of the Necromonger's gargantuan statuesque Mount Rushmore type weapon delivery system in the Chronicles of Riddick; Shaw reaches seeming sanctuary after a truly crappy day only to find an engineer and a giant alien hexapus on board; a similar scenario to that which Ripley will experience a few decades hence; the engineers appear to be albino versions of Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen, and so on and so on.

Part of what made the original so compelling was the make-up of the crew; they were all believable and behaved in expected ways and, largely, went about their jobs with humour and sometimes, apart from allowing Kane back on board, grudging, efficiency. The crew members of the Prometheus are exactly the opposite: these people have been chosen by a corporation who can afford the best of the best in terms of intellect, knowledge, experience, skill, versatility, the ability to think strategically and above all, logically, and they pick these buffoons?  That is taking the suspension of disbelief too far!  Ridley, what in Gods name were you thinking?  These supreme ambassadors of the human race make very brainless decisions throughout; e.g. why would you snuggle up to a cute little alien when it could be a killing machine and harbour any number of pathogens unknown and lethal to human beings - and this from a biologist! And talking biology, how is it that the engineers have identical DNA to humans but look dramatically different; i.e. 8 feet albinos built like over-inflated Arnie balloons? And how in Heaven's name does a robot `like' a film anyway? Oh well!

Ultimately, it looks great but don't think too much whilst watching!",1394668800,,6011,5.030150753768845

Everything looks great, the characters are interesting especially the ""engineers"". (For the Starcraft fans out there, these are the Protoss.) Why were they doing what they were doing? And what exactly were they doing? I'm still not convinced of what's going on in the opening scene which initially feels like one of the engineers is sacrificing himself to seed life on another planet, but.. is he?

Although the mystery lives, there is one huge reveal here. Prometheus explains that <spoiler alert> the aliens were created by the engineers as some form of biological weapon (what could possibly go wrong).

I also love the pickup scene between the captain and Vickers. He gets her to say something like she's not interested in sex. And then as she's leaving he says, ""Hey, Vickers <pause for dramatic effect and to wait for her full attention>.. you a robot?"" Of course she has to answer that, and off to her room they go.

However, if you want to see good science fiction then don't see ""Prometheus.""

This film attempts to play on the present controversy between accepted evolutionary theory and ""Intelligent Design.""

One could argue that this has been done before in movies like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and that would be true. However, some of the things that happen in ""Prometheus"" make little sense, except as a means to create some very dramatic scenes.

Without providing a spoiler I would argue that anyone with the technology possessed by the characters in this movie would also have an effective biological containment protocol when visiting other worlds. Apparently we are suppose to believe that our technologically superior descendants will be able to travel to other worlds but not have the good sense to make sure they don't bring any unknown biologicals back to the ship with them.

4765246,1,B005LAIHY0,"Our review in short.
Even though all of the elements of an elaborately produced, elegant scare were in place for this film, -great story idea, interesting actors, but the failure to execute was not only in the lack luster writing, but also the direction, both of which were way too slow to drive the plot of a `horror' film, btw-which clearly needed a lot more OOMPH, but sadly did not get. and I got this DVD as a gift/as in for free, so I was seriously disappointed--

I like Ridley Scott's work in Blade Runner AND on the Alien franchise a lot, but unfortunately, this film does NOT live up the the Alien scare standard at all... And if you have actually seen the awesome original 'Alien' f'ilm (also by Ridley Scott), you will be more than a little disappointed with this entry into the franchise...

On the other hand, This film had everything going for it, all the elements of a masterful, stylized product, including the fanfare during production, but unfortunately, the end product delivers little to nothing by way of expectation...

Although this entry was supposed to 'explain' the origin of the Alien monster, but segue-ways into the origins of humanity in a way that is a little distracting from the primary story and it seems like he can't quite decide which storyline he wants to pursue so neither story is truly believable as in the original Alien franchise... but, perhaps they were trying to develop too much of a dramatic plot devise and got away from the original successful intelligent-scary-monster-movie-formula that worked so well for him in the past ... But then the lead actress here is very nice and I liked her work in the original non-english-language version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' film franchise (awesome--there are 3 films total), but she doesn't stand up to the presence of Charlize Theron in this film, which becomes a distraction as it leaves you wishing that Charlize had been the lead and Rapace had been in Theron's role --

And although the cinematography and the set design and the overall look of the film were very well done, (being familiar with the director's previous body of work and remember the excitement and hype behind the making of this film, with everyone bending over backwards to tell us that the master of stylized horror was `back' and how fantastic it was going to be and all that, -- and I too, was in agreement), but the end result is not what we expect from all the promo and even some of the reviews.

Having seen the first two ""Alien"" films and both, the 1950's and 1980 rendition of ""The Thing"" and so I had high hopes for this latest horror offering to the sci-fi genre as well.

And honestly, sitting through it, I really wanted to like this movie more. And while I loved the look (set design was really really well done) and general idea of the film, and I understood what they `meant' to convey in the story, but somehow the director failed to bring the essential elements to fruition and frankly, the end result of what we actually got to see on screen was, dare I say ((snore))...

It's hard to describe a sci-fi horror film as boring, but in all honesty, it was... NOT scary at all--
So, unfortunately, one star it is (and that was for the fantastic set design, not the 'lackluster' delivery of the story-element) ...

Our grade; D+ , or 1.125-Stars!
Cheers!",1393718400,,3343,4.6256323777403034

Everything looked very futuristic as to spaceshape and all the fancy instruments. This sci-fi a little different than others. There is a trace of the movie Aliens in it. One downside that took away from being a great sci fi is the modified all-terrain vehicle they used throughout the movie. It looked way out of place. Kinda cheap. They should have stuck with the accompanying vehicle they used to transport explorers from the ship which looks more like the transporter that was used in Alien.

The story line was pretty good. Old guy looking to live forever, so looking for those that created humans, since they must have answers on living forever. Prometheus was the name of the ship and not coincidently in Greek Mythology was ""the Titan god of forethought and crafty counsel who was entrusted with the task of moulding mankind out of clay.""
I can not say I understood all of the ending with the lizard like creature reappearing after jumping into the alien body.

Sadly, it ended up being a total waste of time. There were so many scenes that left me scratching my head and wondering what the hell just happened and how it managed to segue. For instance, Noomi gets an alien ripped out of her but--yay!--miraculously save some staples, she's all good. The boyfriend, who's name I can't be bothered to remember, loves her desperately but fails to mention that he is infected with some alien larvae...thing. I mean, what's a little alien bodily fluid swapping between the person you love, right? Oh and their progeny? He gets sprayed with some sort of decontaminant and left hanging for dead, but miraculously appears about, oh, say a day to be generous, later. Just in the nick of time to save Mum from the mean old alien chasing her.

I just watched the first half of this movie in 3D (I had already seen the movie in 2D) and it is fantastic how well it looks in 3D. They really integrated the 3D feature into the scenes quite well. The opening first 5 minutes of the scenery had me saying ""wow!"" over and over again. Instead of being flagrant with the 3D and having stuff come jutting out of the screen, they give you a more ""immersive"" effect of actually being IN the movie. In a movie of this type that really adds to the enjoyment and excitement. The audio is quite good with good speaker seperation and location of speakers as well as background sounds are well done. I had NO problems with the disc as far as it booting up and running. It went into 3D without a glitch. If you want to demonstrate 3D to others this is definitely the disc to use. I am looking forward to watching the second half of the movie and actually held off on watching it in order to be able to enjoy it over a two day period. It's that good. The added features are nice, but I don't buy a movie to see added features or hear commentary. I buy a movie to SEE the movie.

Prometheus looks absolutely marvelous. The cast is fabulous. And what can you say about the special effects except yee-gods? Sadly, all this is squandered on a plot that is rather flat -- other than graphic depictions of murder by aliens -- and depends on stupidity for its advancement. Without spoiling a lot, one can list a number of examples of the screenwriters' idiocy: Part of a structure has breathable air, and so everyone removes helmets, unmindful of the presence of harmful microscopic organisms. An alien snakelike creature pops up from a puddle of goo, and presumed scientists taunt and play with it like it is harmless, which of course it isn't. In one instance an infected crew member is killed rather than be allowed back on board, while later another member who has reappeared after vanishing has  the door opened for him without question -- and with negative consequences for everyone else. It goes on and on. The visuals help salvage this film, but just barely.

4765659,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is the prequel to Alien, which was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  This film provides a multitude of thrills and chills, and -- yes -- the Aliens are there.  But it's a more philosophical film that asks questions about man's origins and our inability to find the ultimate creative spark for our existence.  The film is constantly dark befitting its mood of imminent danger.  The crew that lands on the distant planet looking for architectural evidence of the beings that created us seems constantly on the verge of destruction, and, in fact, most of them die.  Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) is at the top of his game, even when the script doesn't match up to his directorial and special effects powers.  And while you expect plenty of death and mayhem in this film, it's still horrifying.  If you need that catharsis in your life, you'll find the film provides it -- and without the need for cartoonish characters from slasher films.

I was particularly impressed with the scenes when the pre-cursor human being projected our galaxy around him and demonstrated his complete control of it.  In 3-D, this projection was quite magical and worth the price of admission.  But can a woman go through abdominal surgery (done by a robotic surgical system with no human being present other than the patient), then struggle to get off the operating cable, and have the energy and will power to save the galaxy?  Kind of doubtful, but plenty exciting as well.  The best 3D came in the projection of the solar system, much of the rest of it was depth and ambience.  Overall, I liked the films and enjoyed the set of creatures threatening the crew of the space ship.

The other characters could've been fleshed out better. Expecting sequels/prequels to resonate as with the original is always a mistake, for obvious reasons, but lots of people do it anyway. I'm hoping to see a ""Contact"" sequel to this with Rapace's character arriving on the Engineer's planet.

4765731,3,B005LAIHY0,"After watching the exhaustive pre-production, post production footage, and deleted and alternate scenes that were included on the bluray for Prometheus, I am left wondering what the hell Ridley Scott was thinking when he edited this movie.

""I'm going to put three cameras on this and shoot the crap out of it."", that's basically what I took from the interviews with Ridley.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan.  I probably like more of his movies than the average moviegoer but wow.  I think he got lost in the editing of this movie.  All the character moments in the movie were willfully deleted.  I think if I were an actor in this film, I would probably wonder what happened to my performance.  I don't want everything spoonfed to me but dang.  It helps my enjoyment of a film if I think the people walking around on camera have some semblance of personality.  All the characters were de-emphasized basically.

While I didn't agree with Ridley Scott's editing choices and would have preferred a longer and more complete film, I did agree with his stance on shooting every special effect practically (in camera, with actors, puppets, models, animatronics, etc) where possible.  One choice in particular between a digital monster and an actor in makeup, I think, made complete sense.  If only that decisiveness carried over to the editing process... Woe is me.

Actually, I name him in the review since he's the director, but Ridley Scott is hardly alone in this problematic film venture.  There were hundreds of people working on this film and they were all drinking the same Kool-Aid.  From a production and costume design standpoint, beautiful work.  Stunts, excellent.  Digital artwork and effects, excellent.  Cinematography, excellent.  But in the face of all that good work, everyone (behind the camera, so to speak) dropped the ball telling the story.  I get the impression that Ridley Scott would think up cool sequences (whether it's just shooting sequences or actual action/effect sequences) and then tell the script-doctors to find a way to fit it into the thing which would be fine, if it wasn't seemingly at the expense of having a cast and a story.

All of this uneven handling of the film that I've described above is mercilessly compounded by the fact that the movie is raising questions about religion, God, and creation.  The way Prometheus was sold to audiences (in some instances as, ""HEY!  ALIEN PREQUEL!!!"", and in others as an intense, scary, edge-of-your-seat thriller) didn't do well to prepare moviegoers for what ended up being some overwrought navel-gazing.  But that's not all!  No, religious/spiritual debate (at least in the U.S.) has also to a large extent, regressed to the point of embarrassment.  Pope Francis aside, there are a lot of close-minded individuals running around out there and probably none of them want to be told that aliens (accidentally?) created mankind.  While Scott should have by no means catered to this low common denominator, he should have been conscious of the fact that he was already pulling a bait-and-switch on the hardcore Alien(s) crowd, and that stacking Space Jesus on top of that was maybe a bad combination.  Or hey, maybe it would have been as simple as putting as much effort into the ad campaign as was put into the supplemental material on the DVD release and other frivolous pursuits like the Weyland Industries website (it's still up).

I still found things to like in this movie, but I'm keenly aware that I am in the minority.  I admire what Ridley and co. tried to do and I love that so much interpretation is left up to the audience in terms of getting ""answers"", but ultimately Prometheus suffered horribly in the entertainment value department due to an overall lack of a clear vision and a sense of direction for the story.  I'm sure I'm also in the minority for hoping that the planned(?) sequel knocks it out of the park and renders all the various hand-wringing over Prometheus more or less moot.  (Read as: Don't run away from sci-fi as a genre, Ridley.  I want you to succeed.)

Quick notes: I didn't care that Prometheus wasn't more explicitly tied into the Alien franchise/mythology.  Also, I didn't mind the slower pace of the movie (another reason why I think the length of the film being extended would not have hurt it overall).  These are things that may bother others (you) so I suppose that is my disclaimer.

Other points of interest: the 4-disc set includes the digital 3D release, the Bluray release, the standard DVD release and two digital copies (Ultraviolet and iTunes).  All the special features (and there's a lot of them; set aside a good three or four hours and hit ""play all"" if that's what you're into) are included on the bluray so even when it's just Ridley Scott sipping wine and stalking the art department, it's in glorious true HD.

4765734,5,B005LAIHY0,"Maybe it was because I'd read initial reviews, which were less than stellar, and so popped only for the basic 124:00 version. I re-reviewed my cut-down version; after multiple, closer viewings and abjectly apologize to Director Scott. I should have given PROMETHEUS top stars.  This film's the Sci-Fi version of CITIZEN KANE. Like, for many if not most viewers, it's 'way ahead of its time. T'was ahead of me.

I just re-ordered PROMETHEUS in the Blu-Ray/DVD+ Digital Copy. My initial cut-down version finally hit me,
so this one will no-doubt blow me away immediately. But, abbreviated or not, the standard DVD version's visuals
were stunning. Whatever your budget or film criteria, this is a fine film for everyone. Except kids.

So very stupid and heavy-handed. (Any film buff knows what I'm talking about) However, this film is excellent; acting is great (Fassbender anyone?) and as a Ridley Scott fan, it is breathtaking to see him still thriving and pouring his vision onto the screen.",1390176000,,428,4.5
4765736,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm reading a lot of the bad reviews of this movie, and while there is one big question that the movie didn't answer  that seemed to be obviously waiting for a sequel, there are lots of other criticisms that reviewers are lobbing at the movie that I feel are unwarranted, and many other questions that people didn't think the movie answered that the movie did answer, sometimes in plain spoken sentences, sometimes in scenes you needed to put together.

For example, many people accuse the characters of behaving irrationally, for example ""why do they just take off their helmets on an alien planet when there may be pathogens and other particulate matter in the air?""  But right before they take off their helmets, they discussed, for about 30 seconds in plain English, how their instruments were saying that the atmosphere was clean, breathable, and free of pathogens.

Another source of negative comments seems due to the fact people didn't realize that some of the actions taken by the android were secret directives he was receiving from a higher authority.  He didn't just do evil things randomly and nonsensically by himself, like putting the drop of foreign substance in someone's drink; he had been instructed to do it; like the Android in Alien I, it is revealed near the end of the movie that this Android had been receiving secret directives.

I guess this is just the kind of movie you have to watch really carefully.  I just watched it yesterday and I thought it was great and liked it just fine; couldn't believe the heap of negative reviews here, especially criticisms of the above sort that I just mentioned.",1390089600,3,1625,4.802867383512544

4765798,2,B005LAIHY0,"The original script (which is available online) would have fixed enough problems to reduce this train wreck of a movie to a bad derailment. Prometheus falls victim to the current trend in sci-fi to take a great script, strip it of all essential detail, most dialog and remove all critical information that would bring meaning to the characters' actions. I then utterly wastes incredible plot potential and masterfully created digital imagery on a cast of adults acting out like rebellious teenagers.

Noomi Rapace is the worst casting ever. She cries, whines, moans and screeches ad nauseam. The entire crew of scientists act like unruly teenagers who behave with more recklessness and angst than a band of drunk teens topped off by the lead scientist pair casually fornicating unsafely and giving each other space-STDs.

Everything Ripley (Sigourney Weaver's lead character in Alien and Aliens) was Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is not. And everything Ripley wouldn't do, Elizabeth Shaw does. What happened to Ridley Scott? It's hard to believe he really directed this film.

The story is some sort of unclear attempt to explain away humankind's creation as an alien engineering experiment gone amok. The overbearing soundtrack has the tone of anticipatory drama--but it never occurs. Everything the characters do is stupid and predictable. And the worst attempt at profundity that fails absolutely is the meaningless declaration of Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace): ""Because that's what I choose to believe."" Maybe Ridley was trying to defend people who believe in God or something equally supernal. Instead, he gives us the non-sequitur of non-sequiturs.

The movie is mostly scene after scene of inexplicable violence that serves only to lay a foundation for the movie Alien. In other words, it's only success is to serve as a prequel to Alien. But apparently, that is the one thing Ridley Scotts denies that it is.

Based on this stinker and Martian, I think it's time for Ridley to retire. After Alien he said he'd never do another sci-fi movie. We are glad he didn't follow through with that promise and gave us Blade Runner. But now I think it's time for him to fulfill that promise.",1390003200,3,2188,5.0835654596100275

4765806,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus, as a prequel to Alien, was destined to be loved and hated by viewers.  As a matter of disclosure, Alien is a film I have watched more than any other, starting in my high school years with a long run at a local drive-in visited just about every weekend.  Alien set the tone for everything that followed.  And also as a matter of disclosure, force ranking the Alien series, from best to less than best:  Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, and Alien 3.  I know why people might put Aliens in front of Alien, but that is another discussion.

So where does Prometheus fall in this continuum?  At this point, I have probably watched Prometheus more than 20 times.  The first viewing in the theater and in 3D left me wanting more and a bit perplexed.  After watching it multiple times on cable, I think it is well made, answers lots of questions, and provides a great base for further films.  For me it falls right in behind Aliens as slightly better than Resurrection for various reasons (although the actors picked for Resurrection were stellar).  For this review I am not going to get into plot lines, holes, acting, or really anything that has been covered ad nauseum by other reviewers.  You either like Prometheus or you don't.

What I wanted to say is that the Blu-ray 3D version is a great transfer, and while not quite the big screen theater experience, the 3D effects are wonderous in places.  Moving to about 4 feet in front of a 65"" plasma, things start popping.  The formation of life in the opening sequence is just an opening salvo. The initial presentation with the projection cube on the ""why are we here"" mission briefing makes you seem like you are right there in the room.  The 3D model on Prometheus' bridge of the mapped alien complex really comes forward.  And then there is David standing in the middle of the alien navigation diagram, still as exciting as it was in the theater. This version of the film is well worth it if you can view it properly, and there is enough 3D to keep your interest without being over the top.

3D is seemingly on its way out on the broadcast side, but let's hope that it is not dead as a format to be experienced in theaters or on disks like Prometheus.  5/5 for the 3D transfer and effects, 5/5 for the Amazon price (cheap!), 4/5 for being potentially confusing without multiple views, and 4/5 cus it is not Alien or Aliens!",1389571200,,2379,4.503496503496503

4765874,3,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" is a fun movie because we have experienced a large drought in terms of acceptable sf movies as of late. (I am laughing repeatedly that the attempt at ""At the Mountains of Madness"" adaptation has dived repeatedly, and that the ""Alien"" franchise has languished in a development hell that would make Satan's secretaries sit up on their hooves and take notice.) I like it on its own terms, but I don't think it's a coherent venture. I really feel like the kitchen sink could have been tossed in in order to completely distort this picture! It is noteworthy, though, because it's a film that advocates abortion (check out that surgery scene guys!), and questions the productive aspects of sexual intercourse (this would be funny, if there weren't always something alien or insect lurking beneath the eyes of the fornicator on the morning after). ""Prometheus"" suffers from the gladiatorial combat syndrome; it wants to be big, it wants to be bad, but it flexes its muscles for the wrong audience, while pouncing around as an unofficial prequel (of sorts) to ""Alien"". Well, I don't know about that. I don't see much of ""Alien"" in this. However, it irks me more that Scott didn't try to make an actual prequel to that movie! This looks like hodgepodge. But, since we are never going to see Strazincysky's film remake of ""Forbidden Planet"" (a dubious undertaking I would say, since the backstory of that movie leaves a lot to be desired), ""Prometheus"" will have to do for those of us who are starved for big-budget science fiction-themed epics. Oh, I've got it, why don't they remake ""The Thing?"" Oh wait...they did, and it sucked. At least we can't speak of ""Prometheus"" like we can that unfortunate travesty.

4765963,2,B005LAIHY0,"here's a simple, time-tested recipe for good drama: stick regular people in exceptional conditions and tell the story of how they rose to the occasion to beat the odds. aliens (alien 2) is a darn good example of this. just a bunch of regular people, some of them f-ups, some like ripley just hard working folk, that were thrown into an incredible, unexpected situation and rose above themselves to overcome (well okay, most of them died, but they do so with honor for the most part, not as fools).

this works because it's something we can all relate to. most of us aren't scientific geniuses, we're not super heroes or athletes or super rich. and we all like to think at least that we could rise above our day to day lives if the situation called for it.

prometheus violates this formula at every turn. let's begin. first, consider the mission. an unfathomably important interstellar voyage using an incalculably expensive space ship. who gets chosen for the voyage? the two scientists (guy and gal) are complete babies with their refusal that anything monetary should be considered. umm, hi? why did they even get to go on this mission? then there's the punk-rock geologist that's all ""f-everyone i'm here for the money."" there's the cold business woman who seems more like a robot than a person. and so on. it's all the crew could do to not strangle each other from the first scene. they can't agree, or compromise on any aspect of the mission.

here's reality. the *only* people that get chosen for such a mission are the absolute most socially well adapted, smart, balanced, reasonable people. the crew of the prometheus would never, ever have made it past the screening process for such a mission. even if they were all the very brightest in their fields, that's less important than having a group of people that can cooperate.

because of this, there's nobody to associate with, unless you are perhaps a paranoid narcissistic genius. this is what ruined the movie for me. i could not stop thinking ""my god, this people are idiots"" and how unbelievable it was that such idiots were chosen for such an important mission. most of the so-called drama in this movie results from the crew having arguments and some of them taking incredibly careless actions on a hostile alien world light years from earth.",1388707200,4,2308,4.7625

If you're a true Alien fan then you should hate this movie. There's no other way of putting it. Prometheus actually has almost nothing to do with the original masterpiece Alien. This is just another pointless prequel/reboot that's thrown out to the masses to try and cash in, because everyone is familiar with the franchise. Nothing in this plot makes sense. The characters are unlikable and don't act like real people. The whole mission that these idiots are going on is stupid. They don't bring any weapons for first contact. They make one dumb decision after the next and yet they're supposed to be logical scientists. The surgical scene was ridiculous. There's also very little action or horror in the whole movie. Lot's of pointless talking about faith and philosophy. It's one of those movies that thinks it's smarter than it really is. It's rather insulting to the audience. And then they try and tie everything together and act like it has something to do with the original Alien. It doesnt, Prometheus is pointless and a waste of time.

4766115,1,B005LAIHY0,"There are so many issues with Prometheus it's difficult to know where to begin.  Although it pretends to be an Alien prequel, it most certainly is not that.  This film had the potential to be truly great, but appears to have suffered from too many people battling for creative control.  As a result, the story line is a mash-up of conflicting visions.  The main characters (who are supposed to be scientists) run around doing the most asinine things, and essentially throwing the scientific method out the window.  Towards the end, you find yourself rooting for the aliens to kill off these idiots.

Other items:

1.  The Dr. Shaw character starts the movie off with a quasi-British accent, but by the end of the movie the accent is definitely Swedish.  So is she English or Swedish?  Poor scripting/casting, directing, editing here.

2.  Dr. Shaw is on a planet with atmosphere comparable to Earth's, but she is still wearing her helmet (presumably to avoid contagion).  However, she isn't wearing any gloves!  Again, poor directing and editing.

3.  I counted at least 4 distinct alien life forms that were extremely lethal; most of these invade the body directly, gestate, then explosively emerge thereby killing their host (as in the Alien series).  However, no indication whatsoever how these hostile life forms coexist in symbiosis for thousands of years with no human hosts available.

4.  The remaining crew on the Prometheus decide to kamikaze the Engineer's ship based on Dr. Shaw's theory that the Engineer's ship is supposedly traveling to Earth.  No supporting evidence for her theory is provided, and the captain and remaining crew destroy the ship and kill themselves??  Now for the best part ......  after the Engineer's ship is rammed by the Prometheus, it falls back to the surface of the planet and comes to rest nearly intact.

There are also several egregious examples of the scientists on this mission doing the stupidest things possible .... there are too many instances of those to list here.

Give this a one star for utter lack of the imagination in regards of alien lifeforms and contact with humanity. Give a five star for the brief planetary landscapes and 'alien technologies'. Give a three star for the performances considering the lack of decent imaginative and more solidly constructed plot- little to work with.

Too bad that the imaginations that have created the gorgeous alien spaceships were not put to good use in co-creating well being, peace, integrity, honesty, curiosity towards other forms of intelligence in the Universe.

4766152,4,B005LAIHY0,"I think I was looking forward to this movie so much that I couldn't possibly dislike it, no matter how hard it tried to make me hate it. And oh, did it try. But I've made my peace with it, and what I've wound up with is a movie that sits close to the top in the Alien franchise, in terms of quality and watchability.

For one thing, until the sequel comes out (if it does), I'm treating this like the direct prequel it was supposed to have been until Lindelof put his incompetent hands on it. What's stopping it, apart from a minor technicality of the planet's name being slightly different? Nothing, really. So it's the prequel I was expecting.

Other than that, it's just a matter of gritting my teeth and accepting that creating weird imagery that exists solely for the purpose of being weird, no matter the logic behind it (see: the entirety of Lost) is just something that Lindelof does and, somehow, keeps being paid to do. Having done that, I can re-watch this and get almost as much sheer enjoyment as I did the first time I saw it, in the theater. It's much better than focusing on the broken promise of what could (and should) have been, given the talents involved here.

The characters also have pretty different personalities and thoughts on the mission they are going on, so the film is also pretty dynamic.

Prometheus, in my opinion, is one of the best sci-fi horror films I have seen since Battle:L.A.

This movie is not for everyone but if you like sci-fi movies you should really like this one. None the less I have enjoyed this movie in theaters and and at home in 3D. Personally I think this movies rocks! Some bad ass CGI worlds and special effects along with a strange and twisting story. All these critics here claiming it's a rip off from other movies...I've never seen a sci-fi movie with the plot of ""what they found on the other planet and why that planet was set up the way it was"" ...no spoiler so I choose my words carefully. But really freaking cool how the story unfolds once on the new planet. I was not expecting the element of horror. I'm not a fan of horror movies but I like when they are done in sci-fi without a lot of gore.  I also enjoyed the beginning opening sequence of how the aliens left there DNA behind, pretty cool. The writers even threw in the God factor to this movie, and a battle with Faith and science, and I loved that about the movie. I for one am with the Christian scientist :)
I think Ridley Scott did a great job with this movie and Prometheus is one of my favorite sic-fi movies. I don't think I've seen a Ridley Scott movie yet that I didn't like. I really hope Prometheus part 2 comes out because they left it wide open. At $20 for 3D, BR, digital copy and Ultra-Violet you can't go wrong with this 4 disc set.

There was a great ensemble cast that included Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, and Michael Fassbender from X-men First Class. The problem wasn't the casting. The set was well done and seemed well set up for a sci-fi movie. The director was Ridley Scott who usually does a good job with the movies that he is involved in. Considering all of these things, why was this movie a disappointment? I my opinion it had to be the script itself. The writing was kind of disjointed. The script left more questions about the alien race than it answered. The actions of most of the crew didn't make much sense with the exception of Idris Elba's character as the captain and Noomi Rapace's character.
I also didn't understand why they chose to have Idris Elba do a southern accent when they had other characters with british accents. Idris Elba with a british accent has a commanding presence. Why waste that?

As I explain in my full review of the movie here: [...] it seems that the movie is more than simple entertainment; it is a vehicle for two anti-Christian ideas.  The first is that mankind came from aliens, as opposed to being created by God.  This is not simply part of a fantastic plot line, rather it is a theory that will be more and more accepted as other evolutionary theories for the origin of life are discarded.

The second idea is around the nature of faith, or belief.  As in many Hollywood movies, belief in the movie is portrayed as relative, non-fact based, and somewhat arbitrary.  A faith not worthy of the name.

Maybe with the good: Michael Fassbender is undoubtedly actually a robot in real life. Most of the other performances were credible, too. And Ridley Scott does his usual beautiful visuals.

Okay, I guess that's about it. The rest is just desperately awful. Story anyone? Was there even a script for this movie, or did a classroom of 14-year-olds just make it up as they went along: ""Oooh, this would be cool, let's do that!""? Better stop reading now if you are worried about potential spoilers.

Characters in this film almost never behave in a way that suggests any internal consistency, motivation, or correlation with what we assume to be the rules of nature--neither real nature, nor the created world of the movie. It's like they are deciding what to do next by flipping coins or something.

For example, Theron's team leader character appears to have no discernible reason whatsoever for being on this spaceship. Fassbender, ever the logical robot, infects the scientist with the alien for no discernible reason whatsoever; for no discernible reason whatsoever, Rapace is able to run around energetically without ripping out her Victorian-era staples and disemboweling herself mere minutes after abdominal surgery (not to mention that there's no discernible reason whatsoever for a high-tech, automated, computerized surgical suite to still be using freaking STAPLES); the alien animal creature somehow manages to display an entirely different natural history every single time it appears, or pupates, or reproduces...or whatever the h__l it's doing when it changes into something random and new for no discernible reason whatsoever. The god-like alien also turns out to be a total pill for--wait for it--no discernible reason whatsoever, despite an opening scene suggesting that these aliens were actually seriously self-sacrificing.

The background of the movie was supposed to be that an alien race started the human race, later another alien was sent to help the humans and was crucified (gritted teeth at that, but hey, it's just a movie). Aliens were pretty ticked off and sent a ship full of the lovely eggs for revenge. Some pretty over the top revenge, kill one of them they kill all of us. Ship crashes on the way over (you know the rest of that story).  If they had kept with that story and been more direct with it (seems they didn't want to make the creation and crucifixion story too obvious - lose too much money) the movie might have been better.  Or not.  A sequel is planned.  Hope they do better, learn from mistakes.  Hmmm, Hollywood learn?  Maybe not.",1386288000,,928,4.343023255813954

4766629,2,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" (the movie set in the same universe as ""Alien"" but don't call it a ""prequel) is a beautiful failure, and it is the failure that prevails over beauty.  Despite awesome visuals, ""Prometheus"" leaves you with a lot of plot wholes and WTF moments.

But first - what it's about

""Prometheus"" begins with a giant humanoid being walking near the top of a waterfall on an apparently pristine world.  Drinking something, he begins to slowly and agonizingly die - his body disintegrating while he's still alive.  We see his DNA break apart...only to miraculously reassemble themselves and begin forming new organisms.  Is this Earth - are we watching the creation of us?  The story jumps ahead to the late 21st century.  Archaeologists have found evidence of the giant humanoid's presence in drawings and inscriptions made by a number of Earth's unconnected pre-modern cultures.  Scientists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Halloway makes a dramatic deduction - the beings are engineers...of us.  Grabbing the attention of Peter Weyland, the chief of the huge Weyland-Yutani company, Shaw and Halloway are given the massive deep-space exploration Ship ""Prometheus"".  Their destination: a possibly habitable moon located in the orbit of a planet in a distant system, one that appears to match that found in the ancient cave drawings.  Their mission, under the nominal control of Meredith Vickers - a cybernetically sleek corporate rep - seek out the engineers and in so doing, learn the secret of mankind's existence.

Now what WE thought:

We confess we were seduced by the 1979-Alien-trailer style trailer for this movie.  Very few movies live up to their trailer, but the one for ""Prometheus"" was strongly suggested a very compelling story: scientists set foot on a distant world and discover remains of an advanced civilization.  They dig deeper for more clues, inevitably tampering and setting in motion some horrible secret left dormant by that civilization.  Soon the scientists find themselves dealing not with an ancient dead secret but with a very real and living nightmare.  At first the terror appears minimal - more ominous than implacable - and the scientists believe they can contain it using their powers of reason.  Each attempt do so fails, and the terror only grows, creating a pyramid of fear, desperation, agony and horrible death.

That was the movie the trailer promised.

""Prometheus"", the real movie, is completely different.  The scientists don't act very scientific - in fact they don't do much at all.  Ultimately, all the work falls on David, a beautifully artificial person programmed to speak ancient languages, read alien hieroglyphics, operate the technology of highly evolved civilizations and quote lines from ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  (Like Lawrence, David has left civilization for an alien wilderness - finding himself an anomaly in both.)  Although the scientists do find the world LV-223 to hold a catalog of horrors, the scenes of death and destruction barely link to each other as the trailer suggests they will.  At times it seems each episode of horror comes from a different movie, and none of them are all that vital to the overall story.

What really kills ""Prometheus"" is the lack of a central mythos - that overarching story that holds up the one we see on screen.  The myth doesn't have to be fully detailed or even correct, but it must be compelling and specific enough to drive our characters, and exotic and scary enough to fulfill the promise of science-fiction and horror.  In ""ancient astronaut"" stories like ""Prometheus"" - The Mountains of Madness"", ""The Thing"", ""Five Million Years to Earth"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - the myth is bound by the actions and motives of godlike and long-dead beings.  The myth can be used to explain the ""why"" of the story, and while it can be vague, there should be enough to suggest something more than anybody can come up with on the IMDB message board for Prometheus.  There is only a paltry attempt at a myth here (the engineers created us), one that the scientist protagonists uncharacteristically avoid discussing (if engineers and humans have the same DNA, then that means that they are basically the same creature as us, rather than our creators; also if that was Earth at the beginning of the movie, and the dying Engineer brought life to it, then it means that Engineers have been physically unchanged for half a billion years - a span of time that saw dinosaurs rise from small reptiles to giant monsters and then shrink to become birds.  You'd think that scientists who crossed light years of space would have something to say about that).

Despite its lovely looks, there's enough on the surface of ""Prometheus"" to make you scratch your head - from David's effortless navigation of an ancient alien spaceship, to Shaw's and Vickers desperately trying to escape a falling spacecraft (they look like Fred and Barney running away from a wild brontosaurus).  It's possible that ""Prometheus"" actually suffers for its beauty.  The movie is so primed to wow you with awesome visuals that it tosses out ""The Code of Alien"" which requires that terror be as unseen as possible.  Instead, the screen is packed with alien snakes, alien squid, holograms of engineer armies, holographic space navigation computers and reforming DNA.  Eventually we see so much that we're primed to expect anything except a story to make sense of it all.",1384819200,2,5418,5.01340782122905

4766719,2,B005LAIHY0,"I'll say this for him, Ridley Scott knows how to create stunning visual worlds.  The vistas and visuals created in PROMETHEUS are breathtaking and believable; a futuristic expedition to one of Saturn's moons to--perhaps--discover mankind's ancestral roots sets a promising beginning--until we get to vet and learn about the various characters, who are not only exceedingly reckless, but hopelessly unlikable and petulant and petty.  Yet even these disadvantages are trumped by the non-climax. . .when we learn that, ultimately, PROMETHEUS is merely a mind-numbing prequel for (*spoiler alert!*) Scott's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00000ILDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>.  Such a discovery garners little more than irritable ire and growing contempt; the viewer, having invested two hours into this increasingly silly romp, feels utterly ripped off.

With the exception of Noomi Rapace (a poor man's Sigourney Weaver)--whose self-performed abortion promises to cause excessive squirming--PROMETHEUS presents a cast of forgettable, or completely unlikable, characters, from Michael Fassbender as a conniving humanoid, to Charlize Theron as the expedition's stone-faced, unemotional commander, to Logan Marshall-Green as the Rapace character's love interest who is so clueless and reckless his demise can be seen from a thousand clicks away.  As to the rest of the cast:  Who was in this movie?  Beats the stuffings out of me.  With an A+ for visuals, but an F- for plot, character assassination, and gilded conclusion, PROMETHEUS is a Ridley Scott offering I'll be happy to avoid on any and all future occasions.  If I want to experience the absolute terror so magically captured in 'Alien', I'll go to the original, thank you very much.

Imaginative, highly speculative fiction is the thing I love more than anything except my kids and grandson (yep, THAT long!). I was soooo excited to see this, since it's in the sci fi fan by-laws that you must love Blade Runner and by extension, Ridley Scott.

Sorry, y'all....... this movie is not worth making popcorn to go with it, even if you got the film for free. Maybe not even if someone paid YOU to watch it. I'm usually so thrilled to see even a decent SF movie that I will happily give a couple of mulligans, especially if the acting is great or the concept is unusual. All I can say is that the wonderful actors gave it their best, but nothing could save this sham of a script. Arthur J. Bullock, Jr. wrote a comprehensive and cogent review, hitting all the worst points in the film in an extremely entertaining multiple choice format (heehee)  Look for it, it's great! Wish he could have consulted on the script, because it's basically one large plot hole. Some reviewers have said that the prequel's sequels (?) should fill those in, but they can't undo the absolute zero-IQ of the characters. These people are scientists, making decisions that would have a flatworm scratching its 'head'. Unbelievable!

I rarely write negative reviews, but for this one... well, the talented and mostly wonderful Mr. Scott has done so many amazing pieces of television and film that I just had to voice my deep disappointment, and hope that I can save some of our more intelligent and discerning viewers the waste of a perfectly good two hours.

4767064,3,B005LAIHY0,"This is a good SF film, with concepts, mysteries, and strong action.  However, after so much expectation, it disappoints.  The story takes place many years before Alien, when a privately funded group makes an exploratory inter-stellar voyage to investigate some intriguing archaeological clues.  They are on the track of the ""engineers"", an exemplar of whom died mysteriously at the beginning of the film and whose whereabouts were hinted at in cave paintings found all over the world by Shaw and her partner, Charlie.  What they discover is not what they expect, to say the least.  Also, there are many secret agendas revealed, adding nuance.  In the end, as a survivor, Shaw continues her quest.

Now, this is intriguing stuff, full of possibility.  Unfortunately, the execution of the film, its uneven acting, and problems with the plot combine to make a mediocre viewing experience.  I do not want to give away the plot details, but some may slip through.

First, the quality of the acting was a constant problem.  While Rapace was great in Dragon Tatoo, she is supposed to be English but can't get the accent consistently.  While she does a good job with the complexity of her character's motivations, her intimate relationship with Charlie (who is terribly acted by Logan and never cogent as a character) makes little sense.  The other crew members were clearly fodder for destruction and the few with any character seemed rushed in their actions and motivations.  Theron is an exception to this, but David the android is perhaps the best - he is clearly not human, has inscrutable motives and emotions that are consistent, and is somehow always menacingly creepy.  Alas, the character chemistry doesn't quite hang together.

Second, the explanation for the monsters was disappointing, indeed much of the logic of the film is wobbly.  While the engineers were very well done as beings of superior intelligence and seemingly incomprehensible motives, their behavior and what they were doing were unconvincing to me.  In addition, the resulting monstrosities were not conceived with much care, but just seemed hideous and violent, without interesting constraints and clear powers.  The development of the monsters appears too magical:  how could they develop so quickly, live so long and be so overwhelmingly strong, without a source of energy or food?  Take, for example, Shaw's aborted monster:  it continues to grow to monstrous proportions in the med lab with nothing but itself.  Even worse, after Shaw undergoes major surgery, she just gets stapled up, and then with some futuristic pain killers is fine running around and fighting baddies.  How could she do so without hemorrhaging?  Also, the way that David deciphers the alien language and writing and instrument panels smacks me as contrived.  As others have pointed out, the behavior of the scientists is also incomprehensible:  if one of them saw an alien worm slithering out of the cornea of one of his eyes - and experiencing no pain? - would he not quarantine himself or bring it to someone's attention?  Would the biologist not fear a snake-like creature rising out of some primordial muck?  Would the scientists not fear infection in an unknown atmosphere, but instead instantly take their helmets off?  These things are so ridiculous that they strain all credibility.

Third, the effects were not entirely convincing.  This is a high budget film, but much of it seemed clunky, such as the creature that drags itself to the ship and offs, like, half the crew in a few instants - it looks like a flailing rubber doll.  Or take a creature that emerges from a character's stomach - it comes out bigger than it could have been.  I did enjoy the alien technology, and the engineers themselves - gigantic beings of super strength and superior minds - are splendidly mesmerizing.  Again, this speaks to the unevenness of the film, where much of it feels rushed and ill conceived.

Both the fans of Alien and Predator have had to put up with a lot of bad additions to the respective franchises.  Prometheus is part of the Alien franchise.

The thing that surprised me most about Prometheus was how bad the acting was, don't know if it was just bad acting, bad script or bad direction, which seems hard to believe given the decent cast and great director.  Many times the actors reactions did not seem appropriate to the scene.  It appears as if they were directed to act one way and then editing may have made their reaction seem out of place.

No doubt most of Ridley's time was spent on the set, nobody does sets better, he started as a set builder and designer.  Visually as a fan it was everything I hoped for but already knew that the visuals would be good because of Ridley Scott.

This movie is crap whether you've seen Alien or not. DH had not, I had, and we both couldn't believe how lame this movie was.

Yet another movie that has team members who would *never* pass psych vetting prior to being assigned.

The only believable character for me was the captain and the two guys working with him.

Problems:
someone desperately wanted to ride the coattails of a tremendously well-made movie by making a ""prequel"" and failing EPICALLY
bad acting, but given the material to work with it's understandable
zero character development
unbelievably stupid crew members

Scott's actual masterpieces:  Prometheus' overall direction and cinematography lacks his visionionary expertise; the film's lighting contains none of his expert use of light (a major R. Scott trademark); the musical soundtrack contains zero suspense (another true R. Scott trademark; miss you J. Goldsmith); the script is painfully too 'wordy'; the acting is shallow/wooden (zero empathy for the characters); and it lacks the genius momentum of a true R. Scott sci-fi masterpiece (Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner . . . )  Unfortunately, by allowing his name to be associated with such an amature production, especially since it's clear he merely lent his name to it to secure its production/release, it appears he's abandonded his visionary integrity and expertise.",1379721600,4,881,5.285714285714286

It would have been much stronger if they'd pay more attention to the script.  A lot of the characters actions were so stupid and unbelieveable.

The sense of mystery is what makes this film great, and basically every other film out there great. Everyone seems to avoid the fact that Alien raised many questions, and left many of them unanswered, maybe even more than Prometheus. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same way, but that film is praised, and Prometheus should be as we'll. this film does not rip off of Alien in any way, shape, or form. It is similar in many aspects, but doesn't just show the same old thing.

It's hard to say if it really is a prequel although there are some things that do measure up to it being one...it just might be a a new series in the ""Alien"" franchise from director Ridley Scott...but i could be wrong.

In one of the commentaries on (chapter 33) just before Janeck and the 2 other crew memebers crash Prometheus into the Engineer space craft, Ridley Scott says, the intro of the movie takes place about 10 million years prior to Prometheus ever landing on the planet.

Although LV-223 and LV-426 are in the same solar system and are adjacent to each other, they still share no common ground for the basis of the movie.  Similarities are quite noticeable just like the Xenomorphs from previous Alien movies and the Deacon (proto-morph) from ""Prometheus"".

Yes the Engineer space craft(Croissant) was in the first Alien film and and you can also see the dead Engineer, but the only purpose of that was to show how the Engineer either failed to complete his mission from LV-223(90AD)...crashes on LV-426 or was just a victim from they're own bio-weapon which would ultimately be discovered by the Nostromo ship/crew (Ellen Ripley) in 2122AD.

Prometheus lands on LV-223 in 2093AD to find themselves in a bad predicament, they find and awake an Engineer who was sleeping for 2000yrs in hyper sleep...he tends to carry out the plan that the last Engineer couldn't do, of fully eradicating the human species or anything and anyone inferior to them for that matter.",1379030400,,1614,4.808664259927798

After seeing it, I was seriously letdown. All the characters are dumber than rocks- a scientist pets an unknown alien creature, of which no human has ever seen before, like it was a dog or cat. WTF? He's a scientist, he should no better. Another character gets lost in the alien building being explored despite A) having floating GPS spheres mapping the area for him, and B) the captain at the titular ship has a map of the building as well. How can he get lost?

The plot holes are big enough to fit the Milky Way Galaxy. Why does David, the android, purposefully poison one of the doctors? Why are there no military personnel of any sort?

Not this crew - they dive right in and just happen to stumble across the only location on this world that still has traces of the aliens they are looking for.  Really?

In aliens vs predator, there's an expedition led by a woman to a far off place - antartica. It's financed by a billionaire called weyland who's dying. Once there they discover that the ancient gods people worshiped are actually aliens - predators. Weyland comes face to face with one of them and it kills him.
Now let's look at prometheus. There's an expedition led by a woman to a far off place - another planet. It's financed by a billionaire called weyland who's dying. Once there they discover that the ancient god's people worshiped are actually aliens - the engineers. Weyland comes face with one of them and it kills him.
Does any of this sound familiar ?
In the x-files movie there's a black alien goo that takes people over and physically changes them - just like in prometheus. At the end of the x-files movie, the heroine is running across a fractured surface, trying to outrace a big alien spaceship that's coming up from the ground beneath her - just like in prometheus !
What's worse than all of this is that prometheus doesn't even match up with Alien itself. In that movie the space jockey/engineer is found dead in that big chair onboard the alien ship. In prometheus he's killed in a completely different location ! Also in Alien when the nostromo lands on the planet how come they don't find any of the wreckage of the prometheus that fell all over the place after it crashed into the alien ship ?

This did remind me of the movie series Aliens but those were so much better then this. I think they even recycled some of the alien creatures and ""space ships"" for Prometheus.  I later learned that this is a prequel to the Alien series.  And that they're making another prequel movie - which I don't think I'll be watching.

I didn't recognize who played the Doctor that survived (and got pregnant with an alien baby - same as Sigouney's character).  I didn't like her and found her to be annoying. Weaver did a much better job at playing the female superhero.  It wasn't until later that I realized the Doc played Lisbeth in the foreign movies to The Millinium series (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Hornet's Nest and Played with Fire).  I like the actress but I'm still not liking her role in this.

The acting was mediocre, and I am a fan of both Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron - they're the only reason why I continued watching it.

4767657,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus, that Greek Titan god fabled for bringing mankind fire, for partaking in the creation of mankind.  The title of director Ridley Scott's Alien prequel says a lot doesn't it?  And (good) science fiction has long explored epistemological and moral questions and implications and ""Prometheus"" does so (much better in the director's cut than the theatrical version I might add) but...yes, there's a but...

But even though the special effects are grand, even though we get some eerie and tense moments (a la ""Alien""), and even though this movie purports an unsettling discovery that will give man epistemological answers at least for the Alien universe, it doesn't quite satisfy in the end.  It leaves you scratching your head and asking ""what"" and ""is that what all of this build up was all about?""  The cast of very fine, capable, and attractive actors (among them Noomi Rapace whose character lends the film it's more historically spiritual roots, Charlize Theron whose character is a cypher for all that is vain and surface and material, Idris Elba whose character appears to be set up to display the earthiness of mankind as an agnostic pragmatist, and Michael Fassbender as the robot David--a facsimile of a man who is close to man's own heart in his programming to search for what is godlike) give dedicated performances but the script unfortunately scatters them so they do not gel, at least not at the appropriate times.  It's certainly not their fault.

So it was with some disappointment due to so much promise that ""Prometheus"" didn't bring us the fire that we were perhaps expecting.  But if we can see it with new eyes, over again, might we see more?

Opening sequence is cool, Overall look and feel of the movie is cool.  Concept is cool.  3D adds to the movie but not over the top.  My problems are basic.  A team chosen to explore a planet and possibly contact an alien ancestor would not include some guy modifying his space suit to smoke weed, just plain stupid.  A bunch of little things like that stand out to me. I could list 3 or 4 instances where the movie makers are hurting the movie with unnecessarily dumbing down the characters.

The design of the monster at the end was different, too. I loved the visual effects, and Noomi Rapace proves she can be something other than the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo! Acting was superb, storyline brilliant, Charlize Theron gets squashed, what else can you ask for??

I didn't find the film boring at all, I really appreciated the history it was aiming to uncover and the various characters that appeared in the film.

A group of scientists travels to another planet in order to find out who is the creator of the human race.  They are all employed by the powerful corporation that is funding their trip.  Most of the crew is male and only two (out of three) females have important and significant presence.  One of them is Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron.  An ice woman, beautiful but unapprochable who from the start makes it clear for the entire crew that ""her job is to ensure that everyone on the mission does their job"".  In other worlds, Meredith is an ultimate project manager.  Her decisions are made rationally, she does not expect to be anyone's friend (even her living quarters have special accommodations) and she is shrewd - she makes sure that everyone understands that they are employees and nothing else.

I could see why Idras Elba's Janek questioned her ""humanity"". The remaining characters were either annoying or shallow enough to not care to follow. ""Prometheus"" lacked any kind of creepiness that was overflowing in ""Alien"". I didn't mean to compare the two, but, I was hoping for more depth in the story and people.

In other words, evil has always been with us.

This movie takes 81 minutes before it becomes awesome - shoutworthy awesome.  Then the visuals and the surprise are so mindblowing that you don't mind the 81 minutes that you've lost and just love this movie.  They should definitely sell a version that has the first 81 minutes removable.

Coincidentally,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-vs-Predator/dp/B00D57F7A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien vs. Predator</a>&nbsp;took 83 minutes to get good.  It seems that the Weyland in Prometheus is the descendant of the Weyland in Aliens vs. Predator.  Charlize Theron has a thankless very small part in this film and Idris Elba has a very fake corny accent.  Noomi Rapace is awful, just this mealy wife until 81 minutes in when she becomes awesome and she is completely forgiven forgotten for her unbelievable obviously younger husband who keeps calling her Babe as if to keep her attention as well as flaunt intimacy to embarrass her so as to keep her off balance and awkward.

So this movie kind of sucks for the first 81 minutes and then it blooms into something amazing and hardcore trashtalking if you think it's not a coincidence that Fascist meets Sharktopus Rectum and make an Alien.

You have to wonder at the uncredited cameo of shokushu goukan (poor Comfort Women and Joy Division) in this film and the obvious Vril-like excuse by the Weylanders for embarking on this mission.  I think its great that Ridley Scott brings the franchise full circle and expands it emotionally with this film making&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B001609SQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;more than a movie with clever one-liners and makes it likely that Bishop knocked out Reese, picked up Ripley and Newt LATE because he was picking up an egg sac and not because ""the platform looked unstable"" - what does flying away and coming back have to do with that? and infected Ripley in hypersleep with his bottom half missing.  He tells Ripley in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-3/dp/B000QE1U9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien 3</a>&nbsp;that the Alien was with them the whole time and that the Company knows everything that goes on - just like those black boxes in every Toyota vehicle.  Bishop's declaration about never going to be top notch ever again indicates that he was built to see himself as a real Weyland just like David is the closing thing to a son that Guy Pearce will ever have.

German Michael Fassbender (raised in Ireland, summered back in Germany) imitates Peter O' Toole and rewatches Lawrence of Arabia to practice his delivery while his dye job sets in which might be the reason for that incredible false note when he puts his jacket around Noomi Rapacious's character even though he is the cause of her suffering.

In the original Alien film it would be understandable that upon being woken up from hypersleep that a crew of miners would be pissed off about having to investigate an unknown ""signal"" on an uncharted planet. But on a mission of such massive significance as the Prometheus that we would find such a dysfunctional crew of meatheads an self serving douche bags. Shortly after waking up from an extended sleep the crew look at each other like its the first time they've ever met and one of them trying to be friendly to another gets a response (in a gravely voice) that goes something like... ""I'm here to make money, not be your friend, so leave me the hell alone..."" REALLY? A mission of this magnitude and they felt the need to write into the script this totally unbelievable B.S.? They couldn't create enough drama and tension without the need to add this manufactured nonsense into the film?
  Well, that was it for me, my suspension of disbelief was gone 15 minutes into the film.

Some of us want more than mere spinoffs and hope for a return to the quality present early in the series. I loved the first two Alien movies.  The way Ridley Scott built the suspense in the original Alien film--that was masterful, a real one of a kind, ground-breaking film.  The second movie expanded nicely upon the first, adding more characters and action.  After that, the franchise slid downhill.

Spoiler alert: Prometheus has some great elements, but they are not knit together with any sort of logic.  The characters, supposedly scientists and space travel experts, engage in ridiculously risky behaviors over and over and over--they seem incapable of learning from their mistakes.  Great acting was wasted in this film.  Exquisite special effects could not redeem it.  I found myself uninspired by any of the characters, most of whom seemed to be frenetically racing towards their doom as if death was a goal instead of something to be avoided.  David, the android, was the one character well-rounded and interesting enough to warrant any sympathy.  To a smaller degree, admiration is due the captain and his two crewmates who faced their end with modesty and nobility.  Everyone else deserved to fall prey to the Darwin principal of survival of the fittest and find themselves eliminated from the gene pool.  As for Noomi Rapace, I thought she was beyond amazing in the Dragon Tattoo Swedish films.  In Prometheus, she forged on against formidable odds, wrenching pain, traumas and terrors galore, but none as lethal as the plot of this film.

To begin with, although the ALIEN and Prometheus films look like SciFi they are actually horror movies, and very good ones. Watching a futuristic SciFi production the science and technology has to be accepted on its own terms and not equated to our everyday experience. Prometheus is good SciFi and excellent horror as well as a pretty good action film. It stands OK on its own but is very meaningful in the context of the original ALIEN shows. Many unanswered questions...are the monsters weapons? Are they meant for humans? Who are the creators and what are they trying to do? All unresolved mysteries. Prometheus cries out for the sequel that was obviously set up at the end. As in the other ALIEN stories, again we get a very strong female character.",1372809600,2,869,4.612903225806452

At least this is all I can offer to explain some of the screw-ups who begin to act like teenagers in a Slasher film. This does though point to how this particular film is constructed, a mix of horror and sci-fy. In this sense it is a lot closer to the first film in the franchise than the action packed second. There are a few very stomach turning scenes, so not one for small children or the faint hearted. These things said, there was material of interest. The exploration of where we came from has some thought provoking elements and there's a twist or two as well.

Ridley Scott had been wanting to make this movie since the late 80's and early 90's according to the Making of Alien 3 feature. In one of his more recent interviews he said he wanted to distance himself from the later Alien films and the abominable Alien vs. Predator films that nearly killed the franchise. There are some very good elements within the film and the design and H.R Giger-esque accents put the viewer in a very Alien like environment. However, this film unfortunately follows the pattern of the 2004 AVP movie. A science team arrive at an Alien temple/spaceship and encounter the progenitors of human civilization and chaos ensues. Instead of it being Antarctica it is a distant planet, instead of encountering  Predators they Encounter the Engineers. It's basically AVP with a far better design and isn't nearly as corny. But ultimately this film is not great. It's entertaining, but leaves so much to be desired of the director that created the 1979 Alien.",1372636800,,1047,4.948863636363637

They are on a routine mission to find the source of mankind if they have a link to an ancient race of aliens on a mysterious planet millions of miles away from Earth as they explore this uncharted world to find the answers but however, they discover that they are in danger especially when they find a living organism that creates creatures especially when one of the ancient aliens awakes from his long time slumber.

A well made and enjoyable prequel to the popular ""Alien"" Saga! Ridley Scott who directed the 1979 sci-fi horror classic ""Alien"" returns to his sci-fi roots in this movie as director and Damon Lineouf as co-writer. This movie does have some plot holes but you have to remember that some movies aren't always perfect, the story is quite complex and there is visually stunning backgrounds/sets that hark to H.R. Giger's vision like in the original film with nice visual effects with both CGI/practical effects with good modeling too and good performances. It's a fascinating film about what if life was made by aliens and how we got to see early hints of chestbursters, facehuggers and even a bit of xenomorphs.

I even bought the Blu-Ray when it came out.

I've watched it three times now, and I've finally decided to face the truth: this movie sucks.

An analogy: Imagine you're making lasagna, and you've bought all the best ingredients money can buy: fresh ripe heirloom tomatoes, pasta made from scratch, grass-fed free-range sirloin beef ground, fresh garlic and basil; the works. Then you put it all together with a lasagna recipe written in crayon by a three-year old where all the amounts are wrong and instead of a great lasagna that impresses, it turns out as a dish the depresses: congealed Chef Boyardee from a rusty tin can.

Others have gone into more detail, point by point, but suffice to say that despite looking gorgeous with great special effects (except for the plastic geezer), a mostly very talented cast, a huge budget and a tremendously experienced team of film-making professionals that should have known better, the movie stumbles from one stupid moment to the next stupid moment like a drunk hobo trying to stumble down San Francisco's Lombard Street. You'll smack yourself silly with exclamatory statements like ""Huh? What? Why would you even.....seriously? Really, you would do that? Aw, come on. Now you're just being silly. No seriously, WTF people?!""

Really, I despise this movie. I hate it for what it could have been, and what it became. It's a huge present wrapped in beautiful multi-colored expensive foil Christmas wrap that when you open it turns out to be a case of yellowed tighty whiteys, pleather stockings and one-ply toilet paper.

Do I sound disappointed? Good, then know what I'm getting at.

So if it has so many good elements, like the cast, effects, music and presentation, why I'm I giving it only one star? Imagine spending $1000 go to the Olympics to see Greg Louganis perform a gold-medal caliber dive: you sit in your $400 seats right next to the pool, with your $500 camera, sitting with your best friends to whom you've bragged about how this is going to be the greatest performance ever, and you look up with wide eyes teary with anticipation as he walks out on the high board...and he pauses, jumps...once, twice...even higher yet...and............

....he mis-steps, flubs over the board, flailing through the air like a spastic monkey to land belly-flop upon the water with a tremendous, moist *splat*.

As he floats slowly down, unconscious, to the bottom of the pool you look at the judges table and they score it: zero, zero, zero, zero and zero.

So the reason I gave this film one star, is that I couldn't give it a zero.

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: NO SEQUEL!! Because even if it's good, it can't explain the hundred and twenty pages of stupid that passed for a plot in this movie.",1372204800,5,2985,4.765503875968992

4768436,2,B005LAIHY0,"I haven't been able to properly discuss this with anyone yet, so I'll just make the following remarks to clear my mind. There are quite a few other reviews of this movie already, and whether or not you're an Alien franchise fan I'm sure you can find what you're looking for in one of those. This is just a feminist rant, and if you don't enjoy those, you'd be well advised to move on before reading further.

Dear Prometheus creative team (specifically, directors, writers, etc. I'm cool with you, 3D engine person),

I would like to ask, not respectfully, if you've actually ever had direct dealings with women who enjoyed professions other than pie-making and baby-having? I thought that possibly Ridley Scott had, as once upon a time he told a story about this chick named Ripley, who, even though she was a chick, wasn't hesitant to strap on a mech suit and fight a face-chomping acid-spitting monster. In fact, at the time, it didn't seem to matter so much that she was a chick because she was just the sort of person who would strap into a mech suit to fight a monster, and that was fun to watch, regardless of genital formation.

I'm not so sure, after seeing Prometheus, that you actually have met women who do things like science professionally. Even if you aren't able to meet one of these fabled creatures in the wild, you could easily research them using the internet. Perhaps a video from NASA showing the control room the first time images were received from Saturn or the start of Curiosity's mission. If you'd done this research, you would know that scientists, regardless of gender, tend to jump and scream like 5-year-olds getting surprise pizza when their missions are successful. It is highly unlikely they would, say, react as if confirming that human life did not originate on Earth were not as big a deal as their infertility. ""Yeah, alien life is cool and all, but my baby machine is busted *tear*"" is just not a probable reaction. Please note this for your future work, as I think you'll be able to use it to your advantage.

Also, you may not be aware, but in addition to science, women these days also pursue professions such as banking and finance. Shocking, I know. Unless a women in one of these fields was just excessively stupid, her reaction to her old and infirm father leaving control of the company she stood to inherit while he wandered off into space for an undetermined amount of time would probably not be to fight for a spot on said mission. Instead, it is much more likely that she would fight to stay on earth and use the time her father was away to gain the confidence of the company's board while generally crossing her fingers that the aliens or old age would make everything a little easier by disposing of her father while he was away in space. I know this would have made it harder to create the most awkward seduction scene in the history of film, but we can't have everything we want. Excessive stupidity would explain the whole crushed-by-a-space-doughut thing, so I may have to concede my point on that front.

I hope that, prior to your next creative endeavor, you will take the time to talk to women in the wild, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that they have interests other than their uteri and poor quality field research.

Lets face it though, you get 2 hours tops to lay down a fantasy scenario that is suppose to be based in science and technology and the previous Aliens were able to achieve it much better than Prometheus.
I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will say this, if Scientists behaved the way these 'Scientists' behave I would question their credentials.
In addition to the visuals the acting was pretty good considering that some of the situations were a little too contrived and ridiculous for my tastes. I think that says a lot about an actors skills when they can pull you in no matter how stupid the dialogue or situation is.

4768773,2,B005LAIHY0,"How can something with so much potential go so far off track as Prometheus? This is the question you'll be asking yourself if you watch this awful science fiction film from 2012. With stars like Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce in the crew and noted filmmaker Ridley Scott producing, you'd think this would be almost a sure-fire hit. You'd be wrong thinking that, for this is a turkey.

The plot of Prometheus, what there is of one, is about a privately-funded space search to meet our makers. The ship and crew land successfully on the new planet which, of course, has breathable oxygen. They find remnants of a cizilization with DNA that matches human, which gives question to what God created in 7 days and 7 nights. Then comes the standard horror, some awful gory scenes of terror, an admission that the old civilization stocked the planet with WMDs, and an obligatory and completely predictable battle for the survival of the human race. In between, there are a few interesting or watchable scenes including one where a woman gives herself a C-section; but this film is, in the main, drivel.

It did one thing well: it probably takes the cake as the most derivative big budget blockbuster in film history. I counted scenes in this movie borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00498VS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, the movie that put Scott on all filmgoers' radar, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2010-The-Year-We-Make-Contact/dp/B000HF4U04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hidden/dp/0780628586/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hidden</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poltergeist/dp/B00471Z3CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poltergeist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>&nbsp;1981 version and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Species/dp/0792833244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Species</a>, without doubt making Prometheus the biggest copycat film I have ever seen. There are a few original scenes in it but little else the experienced sci-fi/horror fan hasn't seen done better elsewhere.

Prometheus was the mythical god of fire who was sentenced by Zeus, for whom he disobeyed, to be chained to a rock where an eagle would come daily and eat his liver. This kept up until Prometheus was freed by Hercules. There's even some of this in this movie, with lots of guts on display. If it wasn't bad enough Prometheus borrowed from just about every other sci-fi and horror film made in recent years, did it have to ruin it for the mythological figure too?

One final note: Charlize Theron, one of the most dependable and talented dramatic actresses in Hollywood, is wasted in this film with incredibly poor direction making her a whiny, downcast character with a Johnny one note dimension. I couldn't tell how well Pearce did because I couldn't figure out which character he played. Whatever it was, it wasn't enough to save this turkey.

The trailers also looked like he might have nailed it. Unfortunately, he actually missed the mark quite widely, and this goes down as my least favorite of all his films. The plot lurches clumsily from one idea to the next, with a cast of bland characters that fail to hold it all together - and whose actions are (to be polite) quite confusing at times. You are left with the feeling that there were just too many big ideas during the production meetings, and Mr. Scott spent so much time trying to make them all fit together that he forgot how to actually direct a movie. I understand the movie had a patchy history of writers too, which clearly shows. One of the many strange decisions for me was the casting of Guy Pearce - could they not have found a real old guy for that role? Did they choose him just because he was in that viral Ted video playing a younger version? Baffling.

The film isn't a complete disaster. Michael Fassbender deservedly got all the plaudits for his fantastic performance. There are some nice set pieces here and there, and the visuals are great as well.

On the whole though, very disappointing. I hold out hope that (despite what he says) Ridley Scott might take this one back to the edit room and transform it - much like he did with Blade Runner.",1369872000,2,1410,4.4192307692307695

4768950,3,B005LAIHY0,"Acting:
I seriously doubt anyone's career will be made or broken based on this, but it was far from the embarrassment of squandering Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, & Ron Perlman the way the 3rd film did. Here, despite the illogical design of the plot, the actors performed at least decently. (Warning: plot spoiler in the next sentence) However, after Charlize Theron's character was killed, then the movie was somewhat balanced on the shoulders of less riveting actors, which even dragged her performance down, when looking back upon this film. Regardless, it was far from her awkwardly overacted Snow White performance. Most of the actors/actresses at least performed on a level well above the gutter-level, where the franchise lost course after A3.

Plot:
Other reviewers have gone to lengths to explain all the ways the character's decisions made no sense, and it is true that this is typically the key aspect of most plots, however in the case of comic book and science fiction type movie, plot also serves on a macro level to tie-in other chapters, background stories, and to explain or justify supernatural forces which defy common science. So, on a mirco level like a play, this is far from Shakespeare, and the motivations and justifications for each character's actions are wildly skewed, but for me this was merely a vehicle to deliver the actions of placing this group of screw-ups in the right place at the right time to cause the critical error that gave birth to countless nightmares later in the chronology. Of course, the more extreme nerds will not be able to resist the kind of over-analysis that can shred any appreciation of a film like this. But, if no one was stupid in a sci-fi/horror film, then no one would die or make the critical errors that led to this otherwise mostly non-regrettable franchise.

Appearance:
Clearly the film's strong suit is it's often mind-numbing CGI and the way it blends so seamlessly in most scenes. The only part where the illusion may have been broken a bit was when the robotic guy's head was laying there talking and it just felt like an invisible body, and not the visceral milk-blood robot head that it strove to reference and be similar to, from Alien 3. The rolling ship was a very cool scene, even if it was a little bit of a forced Indiana Jones thing. The hologram parts were very cool, and overall it was money well spent on both the graphics and the special effects make-up. I cannot say as much for the bottled set design or forced toy marketing of Resurrection or Alien Vs Predator 1-2.

Overall:
The film did it's job of rebooting the franchise, under proper direction. with a fairly ample cast and some flashy technology. Of course the actions and motivations of the characters can tend to be a bit flimsy in a way that does not render cliches into tropes, because it does not really shout-out the sort of films where an idiot going into a dark place is charmingly classic. However, the script was actually written nicely, which is a key element seldom mentioned, and also sorely lacking from the blunder of Resurrection. With enjoyable special effects, a decent script, and mostly ample performances, I don't see a reason why this film is not a suitable addition to the franchise. It is a situation where I am afraid our memory of the early films is greater than the films themselves. The first film was almost entirely shot in the dark and barely showed the alien at all. The second film had a big part played by Paul Riser (the man should have a tattoo that says ""campy""), and the series really only reached fever pitch in the third film, which raised the bar on the franchise only long enough for it to be plunged into the abyss of the next 3 films. So, what hardcore nerds want out of this film is impossible to deliver (much like Star Wars, Evil Dead, Star Trek, etc). It was a great concept in the macro-plot, driven by a clumsy mini-plot, with an ample script, ample acting, and mind-bending graphics.",1369699200,3,3980,4.699140401146132

4768952,3,B005LAIHY0,"Too many unanswered questions on this film. I'm forced to post this after many months of thought and add mine to the sea of over 3,200 reviews. (3,246 as of posting). This film will, like Blade Runner, likely have several different releases and edits to shore this up over the passage of time. Hopefully Ridley takes care of this sooner rather than later. He's approaching the same problems that Weyland faced.

Here goes:

I've finally rewatched Prometheus one more time last night, after a long period of letting it digest. I think I might've seen it now 5 times total. I'm stunned to say that after all these months, no hype, no expectation, nada ... honestly ... that film had A LOT of problems.

It was still good, but it was a definite let down. Better writing than Tron:Legacy? No. Not even close. The visuals were very good. But too many plot holes - and a whole sea of different plot holes than the ones people were bitching about before elsewhere on the internet.

1. Why was Peter Weyland represented as an old man, since he was a master of robotics and making robots that look like humans? Cosmetic surgery didn't seem like it would be that difficult. He should've been represented as a young man, but still dying. Even in 2013, life expectancy is about to shoot up to around 200-300 years in the next 50 (for those who can afford it), so why do we see the ruler of the Universe incapable of basic surgery? Makes no sense. I get that people might have been confused about the difference of aging and physical appearance, but it would've fit to see this addressed appropriately. Just Google: Aubrey de Gray.

2. Why did Ms. Vickers even go along on the flight? She could've stayed home and run the company from Earth (her main priority) if she believed that he was going out there to die, which she had stated. Her very presence after that dialogue killed her character. Did the real Ms. Vickers send a Replicant in her stead? This will likely open the next film if so.

3. After waking from hypersleep, Shaw became shocked to discover what the real mission was and that the mission had a corporate interest that superseded the scientific. This reaction and plot twist was incredibly unbelievable and poorly thought out. One would be trained, debriefed and know full well what was going on, and expected, long before that ship would've ever leave Earth orbit. Recall Aliens 2, when everyone awakes. Everyone was clear on the mission.

4. Millburn (with Fifield abandoned during storm) thought that a snake looking animal on a foreign planet, where everyone mysteriously died, that rises up into an attack posture, like a cobra, is non-threatening and a 'good girl'? That whole scene should've been removed / reshot / never shown. That is seriously bad writing. C'mon, ya'll. This scene has universally been derided the most and found to be the weakest of ideas.

5. What was with the weird sexual energy between Ms. Vickers and Peter Weyland, her father? It was never explained, never looked at beyond the one scene in his bedroom, although definitely underlined. For what reason? The scene between Weyland / Vickers and then the later scene with Capt. Janek (Idris Elba) and Vickers, where he questions her about being a robot - leaves me to believe that Ms. Vickers, too, was a Replicant, and probably not dead -- yet. Here, we once more approach the ""I want more life, Father!"" Nexus 10?

6. The theatrical version's end fight scene between Shaw and the Spacejockey was  way too convenient and over too quick. You could blink and miss it. The extended scenes fight version was the scene they should've shown. Editing down for time is always a bad idea and one would think that Ridley Scott would learn his lesson. I don't think he can blame anyone else other than himself on this one.

7. The Prometheus had *absolutely no means of defense*? Really? Ramming the other ship was the *only* option? That's bad writing. Ship travels through hostile space to a distant location and not even a single missile? That didn't seem to fit the story line at all. Other ships in previous films look like mining vessels. Okay. Got it. But the Prometheus looked like a serious piece of hardware. No defenses? Fail.

8. Strangely, the centerpiece scene of the film, from what I saw, with the most energy and action, was the self-abortion / self-surgery scene with Shaw and the Alien fetus. Odd that a scene like that would be the center-piece in the editing. Odd that a meaningless scene that was fully spectacle become the biggest scene in a film that was  ... 100% spectacle. Well, haha ... maybe not ...

9. Having the waking Spacejockey kill Peter Weyland and rip David's head off for no apparent reason without any kind of hesitation or even having the Spacejockey ask how long he was in Hypersleep for, (like a Han Solo shooting at Darth Vader without even hesitating), was probably the worst writing of the film. Yes, it's a top secret Military Installation and he had to kill anyone on sight immediately, but after having been asleep for a few thousand years ... one would wake to ask questions ... no matter who you were. That's honestly poor character development. If you did that in a novel, people would accuse you of 'avoiding conflict / resolution' which is pivotal for any story. Thus, I'm accusing them of avoiding conflict in order to wrap things up too quick.

10. I wasn't bothered by the falling ship scene as typically, when someone throws something at you, and you run away to avoid it, there's often a scenario where you end up running directly into the downward arc of it. However, that being said, the real problem of that scene was the physics of forward momentum, or lack there of. After those ships took off, they would inevitably crash down farther away in the direction of travel and not fall back to earth -- in reverse. Yes -- that was definitely odd. I need to see that one in a simulator before I would've said: ""Yeah, let's do that in the final minutes of the film.""

And then there's this ... possibly the whole point of this thing ...

11. Perhaps this film is actually, in some strange, tangential way, about abortion. Not the morality of it, which is what we humans seem to get wrapped up in, but the reality of it. Like the line from Fight Club, delivered by Tyler Durden:

""Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.""

Humans now become D-Listed as an awkward, embarrassing accident. Which opens the obvious reality that -- we, the humans -- are a greater threat somewhere down the line genetically, than all these monsters we've set out to find or discover, perhaps including even our own engineers. Consider the following:

A) Dude offs himself in a primordial stream and up we pop like a goddamned freak show.

B) The Engineers panic and set in motion a desire that they need to kill these bashtards (us) off somehow, before it's too late. Like they knew we were too-violent based upon the missing strands of DNA that we lacked from our forefathers.

C) Make goo -- make a boatload of it, enough to possibly wipe out two worlds -- ship it off to Earth -- wipe them out, because these acid blood, body humping, multi-strain life-forms are less dangerous than those freaky Earthlings are. Wow. Now -- that's something to consider. Those humans are destined to destroy everyone and everything, they're tribal and pretty stupid to boot. Eff those effers. Send in the bugs. Send them now!

I give 3 stars, because while it was beautiful and somewhat entertaining. The writing is incredibly questionable. It doesn't deliver what it could have, or even leads us to believe.

It amazes me that so much time and money can go into making a film, and still the finished product contains a host of bad ideas, poor direction, and inconsistent characters. The story is primarily populated with a collection of ""scientists"" who are all deeply unstable and emotionally overwrought. On a planet 2 billion light years from earth, they take one ridiculous risk after another - ignoring all standards of ""science"". But I guess that makes sense, because the film seems to have a religious message to push as well. There are several references to ""intelligent design"" and the only surviving character wears a cross (which she is overly concerned about) and uses phrases like ""the year of our lord"". Please.

4769013,1,B005LAIHY0,"2012 will probably go down as the year of flops in Hollywood.  We had 5, count it 5, big name bombs, each of which had loads of special effects, a cast full of superstars, and months worth of preceding advertising on print, online, TV, and big screen.  In no particular order, they were Prometheus from 20th Century Fox, John Carter from Disney, Snow White and the Huntsman by Universal Pictures, Battleship also by Universal Pictures, and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by a consortium of production companies.  Of these bombs, Prometheus was probably the one with the most hype as it built on the legacy of the Alien films by Sigourney Weaver.

The movie was billed as part science fiction, part adventure, and lots of horror.  Unfortunately, it came across as more of s slapstick with gore than anything else.  Scene after scene broke all boundaries of logic, as if people were purposefully doing things to get killed.  The movie's premise is simple.  Sometime in the near future, human scientists discover a series of archaeological relics that point to a star system far away that sent visitors to Earth.  These scientists join a mission funded by a major corporation to travel to this star system.  Joining them is a crew of security, other scientists, and the CEO of said company, Peter Weyland and his daughter.  Upon reaching their destination, the crew of this voyage proceed to do everything possible to risk their lives and get each other killed in a variety of manners.  If you have ever seen the various incarnations of Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Halloween, then you have an idea for the stupidity of the acting and screenwriting.  This is unfortunate because the original Alien movies were smart and well written, with characters that generally made smart if sometimes shortsighted choices.  Not here; not in this film.  Whether it be the biologist of the crew getting killed by a snake-like creature, or the geologist getting lost in a structure he supposedly mapped, or the crew deciding to do an autopsy of an alien creature in open air instead of inside a quarantined environment; this film was a series of stupid scenes one after another.  The only saving graces of this film was the cinematography, the special effects, the majestic soundtrack, and the oral language of the alien race; glad they weren't speaking English.

Alot of the people that hate this movie in my opinion are in two groups.

Group #1 - Expected this to be a recycled Alien film where there is a group of people stuck on a spaceship with an alien who eventually hunts down and kills everyone but the main protagonist of the story.  Group #1 are just upset that this movie was not what they were expecting but I welcomed the changes ecstatically.  I thought it was genius how they managed to re-invent the entire Alien universe, and not only that, but they expanded it and made it deeper and much more interesting.

Group #2 - State that the film had way too many plot holes and too many questions left unanswered.  I say - that was the point!  Prometheus was partially designed to leave the viewer wondering about certain things in the story which makes the film more attractive in my opinion.  The mystery surrounding certain aspects in Prometheus draws the viewer in and invites him/her to speculate on the possibilities.  I cannot believe people are complaining because not every little detail about the story was explained.  The mysterious nature of the film enhances it greatly.
  Group #2 also likes to makes a big fuss about how the characters make really bad decisions.  Was this the first film that you saw in which the characters did or said stupid things.  I hate to remind you, but it is a film, so the characters are allowed to do all that.  If you are going to make a fuss about those things then you should probably make a fuss about every other movie as well because they are all like that.

Prometheus was fantastic and one of the best sci-fi films ever.  The story was very well put together and kept me in my seat to see what would happen next.  Great actors, great special effects and it has aliens in it!  What more could you ask for?",1368489600,7,2053,4.4972972972972975

Yet they do understand reproduction quite well and use possession and rape in an attempt to create a hybrid. Am I the only one that thinks this behavior would be beneath a civilization this advanced??

Sci-fi needs some new ideas that don't support the concept that everyone wants to use violence and biological warfare to dominate others. Every world does NOT advance toward a military dictatorship just because we seem to be headed that way. I'd for once like to see truly enlightened thinking. ""The Fountain"" comes to mind.

Set on a distant star cluster, a group of ""scientists"" are searching for the origin of man. My guess is a vagina, but back to the movie. So, after some brilliant research (or just a wild hypothesis based upon some similar cave drawings) the scientists are off to the remote cluster to find the answer of our creation. This is where the fun begins. Or not.......

Sleepiness ensues as ridiculous ""scientific"" exploration and human-like alien corpses are discovered. The team seems to fall apart at the seams quite early after this discovery. Then the usual ""good space team"", ""bad space team"", ""what is the actual mission?"" scenarios follow.

This is the movie in a nutshell. Don't expect some mind blowing conclusion or life altering philosophy change. It certainly has some entertainment value and great FX, but for me, it was better to pick out the ridiculous choices of the characters and ranting about them throughout the movie.

Closing... A decent film that didn't have to be 2 hours 5 minutes long. But it is...... So to people looking to watch a 2 hour movie in 30 minutes, fast forward to the ending. You're really not going to miss anything. The ending, however, is rather cool!",1368144000,3,1325,4.698275862068965

4769175,3,B005LAIHY0,"To his credit somewhat, Ridley Scott, visual maverick and visionary director - had moved on from Alien when he approached this project and clearly didn't want to replicate the genre he had created and others had built on.  Instead, Scott delivers an old-fashioned existentialistic sci-fi film with a plot that feels more early 1970s than the post-modern look it offers.

The challenge appears to be: one can't go back anymore to Alien - but you still need to rope in the faithful, so what do you do?  You revive some familiar elements, dash it with a cryptic 2001: A Space Odyssey opening; get Michael Fassebender to channel David Bowie (from The Man Who Fell to Earth); go where no man has gone before ala Star Trek, and try to infuse the meaning of life into this space opera.  Casting wise, Noomi Rapace is capable, but she's no Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron's character is far more intriguing & edgier and should have been given more to do.  While Michael Fassbender pretty much carries the show.

Visually, Prometheus is a nice film and the cast do a good job - but overall the film is too bright (you feel like you're standing in a florescent room); the pacing is too slow to be scary and it telegraphs its moves.  Understandably, Ridley Scott is an elder statesman of film.  He's still got the visual chops and art direction, but in creating a deliberate Kingdom of Heaven style of film in space, it all becomes a bit pedestrian.  At times we are intrigued; at other times, we feel we've seen it before and it's coming at us as it always has - but somewhat slowly.

So that's what Prometheus leaves me: a mixed bag experience with moments of wonder and moments of B-movie.  The Alien franchise has not been particularly upped or enhanced by this, and Ridley's original film will remains the true classic that defined a genre.  Where the original was gripping and engaging - Prometheus will come across somewhat cold and removed in its emotional core.",1367712000,2,1961,4.6686046511627906

4769253,1,B005LAIHY0,"The problems of Prometheus begin with Ridley Scott's unparalleled ride as one of the finest filmmakers on the planet. It's extremely rare when he makes a bad film. Not that Prometheus is a bad film...per se...but definitely a disappointment...okay, it was bad. Even A Good Year wasn't...well, all that bad. It had the frivolous charm of a thin Provence ros&eacute;. Amusing. Light. As it was meant to be and a divertissement for Ridley who no doubt needed a sillier romp after such darker, more intense and bloody films as Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven or Body of Lies. So, I, like many were looking for Scott's return to space (the final frontier), the future and figuring out how that metallic-looking, elongated, insect-looking, acid-salivating alien, Alien, got to be such an adorable, durable boffo star of the silver screen.

Prometheus begins with a bald, rather sun-starved, eyebrow-ridged, hulky future prospect for the Cincinnati Bengals (they could use a lot of these guys) standing in the shadow of a disc shaped flying saucer hovering over a presumably primordial waterfall where bounced-around molecules in the churning waves below have not been able to cluster into the self-replicating RNA or DNA molecules, the necessary building blocks of life.

Never mind that just before we closed in on this seminal moment, that the camera (or virtual CGI camera) passed over a hillside that looked suspiciously green - perhaps from some sort of plant with some sort of very ruggedized RNA strands or non-DNA but remarkably similar DNA-like agent that helped the green planty life replicate itself hither and thither over said hillside. Hmm.

No, no...there is no DNA (or even RNA) at this stage in Earth's younger days. Forget the hillside. The brutish muscled-bound alien will open some sort of urn, drink its contents and disintegrate before our eyes so his ""human-like"" DNA will mingle and mate with heretofore random socially inept molecules, nucleotides and proteins that have been haplessly bumping into, but unable to get stuck on, one another. This alien future nose tackle will kindly give us our much needed sticky self-replicating molecule as his gift so that all life on Earth could begin -- and stunningly hundreds of millions of years later, the DNA for humans will match identically with the DNA of the aforementioned aliens. WHAT?!!

Okay, the mathematical improbabilities and the complete dismissal of genetic evolutionary processes over hundreds of millions of years aside, it was awfully nice of the big fella. On behalf of my fellow humans, thanks ya big pasty-faced lug, ya!

The obvious parallel to Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey is evident even though Clarke/Kubrik's unseen aliens in their story really only gave our early primate ancestors a telepathic evolutionary nudge to become more intelligent and hone their survivalist skills by thumping rivals and other critters over their noggins with large bones that instantly changed into orbiting satellites. And despite that radical jump cut, 2001 still plodded along unmercifully as though prehistory and the modern age had not been left on the editing room floor at all.

Scott's Prometheus one-ups 2001 by going back even further than the Dawn of Man (or even the Dawn of Woman...chicken...egg...chicken...egg) to the Dawn of Life (sounds like a dishwashing soap, doesn't it?) to suggest that all life, even green leafy life on hillsides, are courtesy of big-boned, presumably non-primate derived ancestors reverently referred to in the film as ""The Engineers"".

Prometheus attempts even more profundity, when Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw asks in response to a rare on-board skeptic not fully on-board with this non-evolutionary theory being taken as gospel, ""Yes but who made them?"" The `them' of course being The Engineers. My mind was reeling. No, really. Of course, it could have been a reaction to my $100, 25-gallon drum of cherry-vanilla spiked Coke Zero and the large case of Milk Duds that reclined in the seats on either side of me in the empty theater. I think they may have enjoyed the film more than I did. They're gone now.

Where was I? Oh, yes...in the film, newly discovered cave paintings along with Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics and an animation cell from The Flintstones  serve as the catalyst to this epic Riddlyian quest. Two scientists, and I use that term loosely, via a little metallic Rubik's cube project holograms to a witless Prometheus crew (that would be the crew of the starship Prometheus not necessarily the crew of the film) to explain why they've signed up for this fiasco.

The holograms superimpose themselves on one another to startlingly reveal that all the ancient images are telling the cast and theatergoers the same thing -- that we could have gotten this same poppycock by watching Ancient Aliens on the History Channel and that we were all made by slender NBA super-sized aliens not the beefier NFL-looking brute seen earlier. One must assume that later in prehistory Engineers who have held their corporeal selves together palled around with our primitive ancestors but must have been dieting because of some proto-Bloombergian tyrant's edict about transfats, salts and sugars.

Apparently this amazing discovery, not repeated episodes of Ancient Aliens or Stargate, was enough to convince a dying, wrinkly trillionaire Peter Weyland (who is not necessarily Richard Branson) to spend a trillion dollars or so (chump change in Obama's America, so a pittance really in the year 2089) for a two-year voyage (and that's pretty quick really) across the expanse of intergalactic space to meet The Engineers and to ask them about the secret of eternal life. (Was there even a science advisor on this film? If so, did he change his name on the credits?)

Here's a nit, though. Why spend so much time making otherwise scrawny, sunken-cheeked Aussie actor Guy Pearce into a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian Peter Weyland if we haven't seen his more youthful countenance earlier in the film? Why not just cast a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian? Helen Thomas was available, wasn't she? I hear she's got quite the range. Casting Thomas might have better explained Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers' frosty, sullen...let's face it, bitchy behavior a lot better than the revelation that for some elusive reason, she is the estranged daughter of that more likeable older guy...uh, Guy.

Another nit...while I'm at it. I personally have a problem with certain movie references in other movies. It seems to me that some movies should almost exist in a universe of their own making. Scott's Blade Runner is such a movie. In Prometheus, Michael Fassbinder's David- superbly acted by the way, is referred to as a replicant, a term, popularized in Blade Runner. Essentially, Scott's not so subtle nod to his earlier work and himself, almost as if to say, ""Remember me? I'm the bloke that made Blade Runner. I loved that word replicant so much, I decided to use it again in Prometheus. You noticed it, didn't you?""

By the way, for all the pre-movie hype about Prometheus not necessarily being a prequel to Scott's amazingly directed and edited moody taught thriller, Alien; it is after all the swirling and silicon debris dust clouds settle...the, uh...prequel to Alien. Not that that's a bad thing, because as a prequel, Prometheus is a tad more coherent than anything more cosmologically complex it attempts to explain.

Visual, action and character references to Alien also abound. The character of David not only is a prequel prototype of Ash, Ian Holm's unfeeling, smug and snarky robot (not replicant) who was just one consonant away being a real as_ but both are decapitated and continue to speak after decapitation...because they have really good agents.

After Prometheus lands on the planet where The Engineers have beckoned them across space and time and space-time, in no time at all the crew is happily gallivanting like giddy schoolchildren into what appears as an abandoned dome-shaped building with curved arms much like Bernini's curved colonnade around Vatican square but that we all know is the alien spacecraft we saw a few decades ago in Alien. Please gasp here.

I'll spare you the ponderous details over much of the preposterous narrative suffice to say that David, the soulless, seemingly amoral replicant finds some organic goo and a little black ladybug-like nub that he later not so amorally and deviously drops into Logan Marshall-Green's martini so the hyphenated actor would become infected and be used as a host for some sort of nasty, alien life form because that's what actors do to other actors so they can have larger roles. Happens all the time.

Marshall-Green's Charlie Holloway who is a doctor of some scientific discipline and love interest of the aforementioned Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw, proceeds to make love to Dr. Shaw instantly impregnating her with the alien life form which gestates faster than you can say, ""That was some spicy meatball."" Once she is informed that she's with tentacle-tucked alien life form and amazingly the equivalent of three months along, Dr. Shaw assertively makes her way to an automated, self-contained Mr. Operation machine where she punches a few buttons and has the offending alien fetus extracted and later killed while she has her abdomen stapled up. She is a doctor, after all.

See how convenient the future is? DIY births and abortions. Take your pick, even if you use a Mr. Operation for Men. I had the nagging feeling that there was some sort of underlying message about unwanted pregnancies and a woman's right to choose...not that tentacled alien life forms are what nature or the Creator may have intended no matter how adorable and clingy they might turn out to be.

Convinced that the newborn squid-thingy is dead Dr. Shaw seals up the operating room to find out if anyone on board the Prometheus is up for a little backgammon but is not terribly surprised to find that the old geezer, Weyland has come along for this two-year star trek. But you know and I know and Sigourney Weaver (who's not in this film at all) knows that the icky-many-rubbery-legged-thingy left in the O.R. ain't dead because we've seen Alien and Fatal Attraction and the career of Pauly Shore--and we all know that Mr. Squid is going to get bigger and nastier and more tentaclier and jump out in a very predictable and anti-climactic sort of way.

Meanwhile back inside the Alien craft structure, two doltish, goofball, comic relief scientists who can't seem to find their way out of the film fast enough, Fifield and Milburn find themselves in a worm-infested, muddy, soppy alien nursery suddenly being observed by a nasty, slithery, hissing cobra-like creature. Milburn, the biologist in the party, attempts to play with and fawningly coo to the alien cobra because he apparently mistakes the obviously threatening and hissing reptile for a golden retriever puppy. He and his Scottish geologist sidekick (who is perpetually angry - those Scots - at having signed up for such an awful assignment...one supposes the mission...not necessarily the film...but then again...) are gruesomely rewarded for Millburn's stupidity which, for the theater audience, comes as no surprise and actually a good deal of relief, since they were both more annoying than humorous and deserved to die a lot sooner. Three cheers for alien cobra creature!

Much mayhem soon ensues and I'll skip a whole lot of the not-terribly suspenseful action and the tedious ending, suffice to say that Dr. Shaw's refrain of ""We were SO wrong!"" begged SO many comments and questions, like, ""We were SO wrong about the science in this script!"" Like how is it exactly that humans can evolve miraculously from alien DNA hundreds of millions of years ago, with all the random environmental factors that affected life on earth over time including pandemic viruses, being eaten as prey, oh and the occasional Earth-colliding asteroid that destroyed most of the life on the planet - AND STILL BE AN IDENTICAL DNA MATCH WITH OTHERWORLDLY ALIENS?!!! Let's take a closer look at that alien DNA and see if it includes the chromosomal fusion evident in humans that indicates that humans and chimpanzees and bonobos have a common genetically-linked primate ancestor. (If you feel like challenging me on that last point, please take it up with biologist Ken Miller, he's the expert on this.)

I know, I know. It's a movie. It's only a movie. How could I have been SO wrong to expect something better from Ridley Scott? Perhaps little things have big beginnings to paraphrase the replicant and Lawrence of Arabia - now that was a film!

If we're that stupid by the year 2095 the universe may be better off if the creators had been successful in destroying us or we get wiped out by an asteroid first.

4769256,5,B005LAIHY0,"I love this movie.  I loved Alien and I like this one even more.  This one has a grander story than Alien and to me is more interesting.  Spoiler Warning:  The black goo is more dangerous than the xenomorphs and more interesting because depending on what organic creature you combine it with it will have a different monster result.  The Fifield mutant seemed stronger than a xenomorph.  It also seemed easier to kill a facehugger over the hammerpede or snake like alien since that thing can regenerate so quickly.  A lot of people say that the biologist was very dumb, but I didn't mind that because there are people in real life who confront dangerous animals without fear.  For example ""The Grizzly Man"" Timothy Treadwell (May he rest in peace) was similar to that.  Not dumb in my opinion but fearless and very fascinated with animals especially a new alien speices. That's how that biologist struck me.  He also told Fifield to stay calm and I feel that's how most animal handlers have to be in order not to rile up the animal.  I also thought there were no plot holes.  Of course the movie didn't answer all the questions, but it did it in the right way, leaving it to your imagination.  There are also planned sequels to the movie to answer many questions.  The scientists Holloway and Shaw come to the conclusion based on ancient wall carvings/drawings all over the world (I've seen youtube documentaries about that subject) that all pretty much appear the same illustrate man communicating with aliens.  Or an alien pointing to planets.  They search (probably with high tech equipment) the universe and come across a galaxy that is similar to ours and form the same set of planets like the ancient cave artwork.  And the planet they land on LV-223 is not the same planet as the one in Alien which was LV-426 so that's why it doesn't exactly end with someone in the jockey chair with their chest burst outwards.  There are other examples, but basically I think this movie was perfectly paced and had no plot holes.  I liked all the characters, every one of them and I enjoyed the script by Damon Lindelof.

4769413,3,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott seems to be setting up a storyline that connects Blade Runner to Prometheus to Alien. Promotional materials released in England at the time of the London premiere of Prometheus included a screen capture of a statement written by Peter Weyland. A statement in which he discusses his professional relationship with Eldon Tyrell and the Tyrell Corporation. Weyland broke with Eldon Tyrell when he realized that Tyrell wanted to create Replicants for the purpose of various forms of slave labor. Peter Weyland believed that Replicants had a ""higher purpose"". So the Weyland Corporation began creating their own line of Replicants. Ash, Bishop and David are Replicants, but for a very prosaic reason they're not referred to as Replicants. Why? Because the term Replicant, as applied to androids, is co-owned by the estate of Philip K. Dick and Warner Brothers. And the Alien movies are owned 20th Century Fox, and licensing-the-use-rights-fees would have to be paid...

I've been told that much of this Peter Weyland/Eldon Tyrell backstory is told in the Special Features of the Blu-ray and the Blu-ray/3D editions of Prometheus. So...order those editions from Amazon, if you want to learn more about the Weyland/Tyrell connection. The online ordering information is available through a link on this page. Amazon's computers are waiting to take your call...

I suspect that David is a Nexus 8, who's been given a voice similar to the voice given to the Hal 9000 mainframe computer, that went online at the IBM laboratory in Urbana, ILL, in the 1990's. The Hal 9000 was installed in the spaceship Discovery, for its mission to Jupiter, in the early years of the 21st century. The history of that space mission is highly classified. Top Secret. Not even accessible to those with the highest security clearance. NASA has put those files deep into cold storage...metaphorically speaking. Something about cultural shock and disorientation, should those files go public...

However, footage related to that expedition IS available from Amazon! Just enter...2001: A Space Odyssey...

Footnote: Rumor has it that Ridley Scott wants to make a sequel to Blade Runner. Rumor also has it that Harrison Ford wants to play Rick Deckard again. Which would necessitate setting the story approximately 30 years after the first film...around 2050. But I emphasize, these are just rumors at this time, unless someone out there in Amazon Land knows more than I do.

Sir Ridley has also said he intends to make a sequel to Prometheus. The story of David and Elizabeth Shaw's journey to the home planet of the Engineers. And Dr. Shaw's confrontation with the Engineers, asking them why they created human kind and then wanted to destroy human kind, with that bio-weapon of mass destruction...the Alien, which seemed to have bitten the hand that created it...so to speak. So, perhaps both films will be coming soon to a multiplex near you. And subsequently available in Blu-ray, 3D and DVD from Amazon. Stay tuned!",1366848000,,2999,5.112244897959184

4769416,3,B005LAIHY0,"***This review may contain spoilers***

Yes, I'm late to the party.  This would-be science-fiction epic has already garnered over 3,100 Amazon.com reviews with little danger of abating.  Therefore, I'm probably adding no new insights into ""Prometheus"".  This review most likely adheres to the criticism most 1-, 2-, and even 3-star reviews have already observed: ""The movie is just about flawless technically, cinematographically, and conceptually, but juvenile and superficial (for the most part) in character creation and motivation.""  Arthur J. Bullock's Question and Answer format Amazon.com review has already ingeniously encapsulated my and many others' views of logic lapses in ""Prometheus"".  So, what's left to say?  Well, I guess I'll just basically summarize the aforementioned logic lapses with the opinion that the Prometheus crew's lack of professional discipline grievously hinders the movie.

Contrary to what others believed, I felt that the numerous petroglyphs outlining the Engineers' frequent visits to Earth ostensibly to initiate life were sufficient incentive to organize an outer space expedition to contact these progenitors (even if they DID look like albino bodybuilders).  What irked me was the unlikelihood that a private corporation would be permitted, or even have the resources, to attempt this interstellar flight.  I would have thought that searching for humanity's origins should be a paramount international matter.  And yet somehow the wizened, apparently deceased Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, looking like Goldmember from the third Austin Powers movie) has scraped together a trillion dollars (I guess quintillionaires exist in the 2090's) for the half-baked purpose of going to the Engineers' solar system to somehow find an elixir of youth and immortality.  Even more baffling, instead of amassing the crme de la crme of biologists, geologists, archeologists, and other -ologists, Weyland decided to select the motliest of crews for this little space trip.  With the exception of the competent, devout but intellectually curious, and surprisingly scrappy Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the near-infallible but disregarded and even faintly malevolent and enigmatic android David (Michael Fassbender), the crew is an unorganized joke.

In actual charge of the gargantuan ""Prometheus"" vessel is the sinister, irritable icicle Meredith Vickers, with a gradually revealed connection to Weyland.  The rugged, capable Captain Janek (Idris Elba) is reduced to being a passive spaceship chauffeur. Dr. Shaw's colleague and love interest Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is cocky, brash, unkempt, and unwisely disdainful of David.  Rounding out this ragtag gallery is the really unprincipled doofus duo Fifield (Sean Harris) the geologist and Millburn (Rafe Spall) the biologist, who turn out to be the equivalent of the ""red shirt"" officers in Star Trek.  What a bunch of winners!

No Prometheus crew member - not even Dr. Shaw or David - follows any kind of protocol or discipline, military or otherwise.  They seemingly act as if they're on some pleasure cruise, with time to play pool, swig vodka, make bets, and make love.  Captain Janek occasionally and vainly issues orders.  Usually he's idly staring at the schematic of the Engineer cavern stronghold on moon LV-223 or playing his squeezebox.  Everyone else does whatever the hell they want without supervision, including Dr. Shaw's do-it-yourself Caesarean to extract a squid fetus.  Therefore, it's relatively easy for David to explore the cavern, decipher the hieroglyphics, get samples of the Engineers' DNA ooze, and ""vengefully"" start the mutation havoc onboard the ship.  Again, I recommend you read Mr. Bullock's review to get an outline of the genetic blunders the crew foolishly unleashes upon themselves that utterly unravels the mission for almost everyone.

Watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking that, for all the time-worn techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently.  Certainly some crew members would have been infected and even killed, but the main characters would have thoroughly analyzed the terrain, the Engineer corpses, the caverns, and the pods before going into action.  The crew would also have heeded any information from Spock or Data and acted appropriately.  Furthermore, the Star Trek crew would have had time to address evolutionary, theological, and even ethical implications of the missions meaningfully.  Star Trek naval discipline would have made more epochal discoveries about the Engineers without blowing up their ship. But then again, this discipline would have bored some Ridley Scott or ""Alien"" fans who wanted their icky snake/squid/slimy tentacle thingie fix.

What a waste of a evolutionary/theological vision!  Dr. Shaw is practically the only Prometheus member still curious about the Engineers.  Others, like the doomed Dr. Holloway, thought that the revelation of the human/Engineer 100% genetic matchup solved the problem - Humanity comes from Engineers.  Dr. Shaw perceptively retorts ""Who made the Engineers?""  The mystery continues, and only she and David's head are still around to pursue it (in the Prometheus sequel).  Perhaps the sequel will also answer the questions 1) Are the Engineers attempting to correct their run-amok planetary DNA sowing, including that of Earth's?, 2)What did David say to infuriate the resuscitated, murderous Engineer?, 3) Where is the ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" Engineer spaceship escaping to?, 4) Can Dr. Shaw and David follow them in another ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" spaceship?, 5) Can Dr. Shaw really trust David? 6) How will the surprisingly humanoid xenomorph emerging at the end of the film figure in all this?

Whatever the ""Prometheus"" sequel holds in store, I hope Dr. Shaw and David encounter a space crew that has more in common with the discipline, philosophy, and mentality of ""Star Trek"" than that of ""Friday the 13th"".",1366588800,,6068,5.557608695652174

4769557,1,B005LAIHY0,"This movie is anti-mind.  It begins with the idea that all of the thought and research of our best archaeologists, geologists, chemists, biologists, anthropologists, and many, many others regarding the origin of human life on earth is incorrect.  Whoops!  Darn it!  I guess we'll have to launch a trillion-dollar mission to space to find our creators!  Why do the two ""true believers"" on our mission to space think that all preceding research and thought on the origins of human life is incorrect?  Because ""that is what they choose to believe.""  You see where we're headed here.

The pursuit of our creators (they have the answers, don't they?) will not require any logic or consistency, however.  The aliens who apparently created man left a map, an invitation to visit them.  Following this map, this invitation, we arrive at the military outpost from which they intend to launch a mission to exterminate us.  They changed their minds about creating us, we're told.  We're not too sure why.

Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, our protagonist, is unable to become pregnant.  Unless the baby is an alien.

The leader of our mission to space, Meredith Vickers, has brought a special health-maintenance machine on board, for her use only.  The machine can perform surgery.  But it has not been programmed to perform specific surgeries that a woman, and not a man, might need.

Removal of umbilical cord support of an alien fetus does not kill it.  For what purpose the alien fetus uses the umbilical cord, if not to provide life support, is unclear.  And, yes, immediately following surgery to remove a squid-like alien fetus from her body, a woman can return to space adventures.

I could go on, and on, and on...

This movie asks the right questions about our origins.  But it sees man as incapable of answering them through research and thought.

If you're interested in real origins of life research, you may find two courses that are produced by The Teaching Company to be of interest.  The first is ""Origins of Life,"" by Prof. Robert M. Hazen.  The second is ""Darwinian Revolution,"" by Prof. Frederick Gregory.

The soundtrack is perfect and the scares are spot on. The only complaint I'd have about this movie is that it isn't longer and leaves a lot of questions unasnwered but it is part one of a trilogy so hopefully later on they will be answered.

But somewhere along the line, the high-minded ideas in the script never meshed together and this movie just ends up feeling like a giant plate of spaghetti with some kind of indecipherable and not so tasty sauce.

Overall, there's a few tense moments and the first hour or so of the movie is enjoyable as the plot thickens and you're wondering how everything is going to play out. The problem is, once it actually plays out, a feeling of 'what the heck just happened' is all that you're really left with. More than one person told me about the feeling of confusion they had leaving the theater after seeing this film.

It should be noted that if you're a fan of breathtaking cinematography, you'll want to give this film an extra star (or two).

It was just another round of Aliens all over again. The Charachters were also the same. Even including the Android David. I kept hoping that I would be seeing something different. It had pretty much the same twist as Aliens. Even down to the Alien creatures bursting out of thier hosts. BORING . This has been done before.

The landscapes, sets, costuming, equiptment, CGI are all 10++/10, just way, way mind-blowing AWESOME. Unfortunately, the script badly damages the film..2/10. After the opening (which has no dialogue), it's mostly downhill. Stupid, illogical, silly, inane, moronic are just a few terms to describe the script. It is truly painful to watch a film with soooo much potential self-destruct...oh the humanity!..the humanity! If this film had been written with just a LITTLE better script, it would already be a science fiction classic.
  Despite this mixed review, any science fiction buff MUST watch this film, if for nothing else the esquisite visuals, awesome special effects, way-cool futaristic technology and completing? the Aliens saga/mythology.
  The potential of this film could be salvaged if they would use it as a jumping-off point for an entire new series of films based on pursuing the humanoid aliens across the universe in search of answers and understanding.

if you go into this movie completely forgetting evrything about Aliens and take it for what it is...a really expensive, expansive Sci-Fy movie i think you will enjoy it as i grew to.....no, it doesnt pack the horror punch of Aliens but its not trying to....its the start of a EPIC three part series and it achieves its goals very well i think...

it is rather confusing and i found myself more than once checking online for the plot details which, at the time, is annoying but looking back this movie doesn't pander to the audience at all....you are either in or you are out....simple as that....

4769876,3,B005LAIHY0,"First thing first: I didn't watch the Bluray. There, I said it.
But let's start with the movie itself. It is an excellent flick. Not to be confused with his earlier movies which were as close to being work of a genius as a director can make. This one - not so much. Still - good work. After watching it in a theater I promised myself I would get it as soon as it comes out on Bluray.
That day comes a few months later. I wait until the $49 price for the 4 disc set comes down to a more reasonable number. Two months later it happens - $29. I drive to a local BB store and unknowingly purchase my ticket to hell.
The descend starts as soon as I press Play. Nothing. Dead silence. Usually, there is a chapter selection, special features, etc. Not with Prometheus. After 7 minutes of spinning the disk flashes a 4 seconds panning shot of the 20th Century Fox logo (BTW, is it just me or is this a really terrible name for a company?), then screen goes blank.
My first thought is that BD player broke down. But my BD player (as a matter of fact the entire home theater) is from the Pioneer Elite lineup. Not exactly the cheapest. So, I patiently wait for it to load. At 9PM I give up.
The next morning I remember that I left the disk in the player. The player froze. It does not respond to Stop, Play, anything. I reconnected the power cord. Same story. Fox logo, then bupcis.
I try other discs from the same set. The DVD is fine, special features Bluray - no problem. The player is 3D but TV isn't, so I have no idea if the 3D disc works. It tells me that my TV isn't 3D (it senses that through HDMI!) so I can go suck an egg. This is expected.
I go a little further and test other Bluray disks in my collection. Some of them are even newer releases than Prometheus. All others work fine.
I drive back to the store. No refund, says the clerk. I patiently explain that I want to exchange. She grabs the case and shows me that it loads fine on a BB in-store player. I am embarrassed. After a long drive home i test the replacement Bluray. Still no luck. ""$29 to watch Fox logo spin and hear some trumpets? Some deal!"" I thought to myself. I am convinced at this point that it is the disc that is defective, not my $900 Elite BD player. But why does it work in BB store and quits as soon as I get home? After a few hours it strikes me like a thunderbolt. I drive back to the store and this time I make sure the clerk (a different one) picks the Bluray, not the DVD. Finally - the logo, then silence. They have the same problem too! The previous clerk tested the DVD. This clerk reluctantly gives me yet another 4 disk set. I drive (or, rather, race) home. Same problem again, with the replacement Bluray. At this point I am not annoyed anymore. I am seriously considering that my BD player is cursed. It is a different state of mind I cannot describe. My wife looks at me from a safe distance and asks me if I am OK. How am I supposed to answer?
I hit the Internet. Search ""prometheus bluray defect"" and you will see what I saw. There are thousands of people who went through the same problem I did. It is all because of bad batch (or several). Some of the forum users tell me how to take care of the problem. I follow only some of their suggestions:
1) Update firmware on Bluray player
2) Recycle power on Bluray player.
3) Reset Bluray player to factory default settings
4) Buy Bluray player head cleaning disk with special cleaning liquid ($15.99)
5) Buy Bluray disk cleaning kit ($24.99)
6) Buy latest HDMI cable with some special insulation and network capability ($60)
7) Erase memory from Bluray USB drive
8) Disconnect network cable from Bluray player
9) Disable network access on Bluray player (couldn't do it, no idea how!)
10) Reset network access on player (same as above)
11) Make sure Bluray player is set to NTSC and not PAL/SECAM or MESECAM (don't ask what all this means, could be gibberish for all I know)
12) Spray Bluray player insides with a dust cleaning pressurized can
13) Take the disk out, disconnect all cables and gently shake Bluray player (I made sure nobody saw me do this)
In a few more hours by descend to hell goes into overdrive. I am completely unable to accomplish any task other than breathing and thinking about Prometheus. The body rejects any position - standing, sitting or laying down is impossible. I grimly drive back to BB store. Inside the store I for some reason feel like I stole something. The loss prevention guy looks at me the wrong way, the clerks are a bit apprehensive, the cameras are following my each step. Paranoia starts to set in, of course.
The clerk takes the set and calls duty manager. The manager listens to her whispering while gently smiling at me. They both find a Geek Squad guy who approaches me and asks if I ever used any of the digital copies of the movie. I ask him what they are. He explains. I reply that I have a multi-thousand dollars home theater. Top of the line. Creme of the crop. King of the hill. Why would I keep getting multiple digital copies of the same movie which I cannot even watch on my premium home theater (just on my laptop)? At this point I am convinced that they are convinced that I am just stealing multiple digital copies of the same movie and re-watching them all over again on a tiny screen.
I show them a hundred pre-printed pages of web forums which describe the manufacturing defect in detail. The Geek Squad guy is now 100% is on my side, but BB store manager... Not so much. He suggests I call Fox and request an exchange. At this point I lose my temper. ""Look"", I say. ""All I wanted to do is to watch bloody Prometheus on Bluray. I paid you the 30 bucks, on top of that I spent $100 on cleaning equipment and cables I don't need, $20 on gas driving back and forth! I have not eaten or slept for two days...""
The manager takes pity on me. In violation of store policy he gives me a hundred percent refund and even pulls all other copies off the shelves since there was no way to know which disks work and which are defective.
At home my obsession with watching Prometheus right this instant gets the better of me. I decide to download a free copy of Prometheus off the P2P network. Actually I download two different versions within 4 hours. One is 3D and looks like two identical video feeds split horizontally on my 2D TV. The other one has a perfect crystal clear 1080p picture, but soundtrack is in Ukrainian. I fall asleep to the Ukrainian Prometheus.
In the morning my descend to hell completes. I reach rock bottom. The ancient gods of Bluray decide to give me a break. DirectTV HD broadcasts the movie (1080p, Dolby Digital soundtrack, perfectly watchable). I record it twice for some reason (don't ask). More than that, the same morning BB store decreases the price of 4 disk set from $29 to $19. Of course, that make no difference to me. $19 for a fair chance to view Fox logo, hear fanfare and drums is still a tall order.
Do I blame Ridley Scott for my adventure? Absolutely not. He didn't press these defective copies in some rundown Bluray factory in Malaysia. Do I blame Fox? Definitely. There are so many fans of this wonderful director that feel deceived by this substandard product... It is a crime not to enforce reasonable quality assurance process (testing every 10th or 100th disk for defects) to cut costs. It is a treachery. I am glad that only some of fans experienced this descend into the ninth circle of hell.
Only one question remains. Should I keep buying other sets (perhaps used ones) until I find a copy that works? As a die hard Ridley Scott fan I definitely should - considering the plethora of extra features and commentary it offers. But I would rather wait till it reaches what it is actually worth, about $9 per 4 disk set.
PS. Here is a pres release from Fox 20th Century:
""In other news today, a number of readers are reporting problems with Fox's Prometheus Blu-ray. Throughout the second half of the film, some copies are plagued with macro-blocking and will occasionally cause players to simply shut down. It appears to be a manufacturing error and isn't affecting all copies, so if you're having trouble we recommend you exchange it with your retailer. You can also contact Fox Customer Care at 1-888-223-4369.""
PPS. 4/23/2013 - contacted Fox. Rude person says ""we have no reports of problems with this disk"". My statement that I did not call to find out if there are previous problems, I am reporting one. The Fox lady is determined to convince me that since there ""have not been any problems"" (which contradicts their own PR release which acknowledges the problem) I must not have a problem as well. Still, she agreed to replace my Bluray within 4 weeks. I call Pioneer support to discuss a possible issue with my BD player. Their response is ""this particular BD player has some Java code which makes it incompatible to play this particular title, firmware update is not available yet"".

However, the franchise has had so many off shoots because the bloodthirsty youth within the sci-fi collective have clamored for more gut-splitting, head-splitting one on one encounters with a creature that has acid for blood (absurd because no tissue could hold it! Think about it! Even one based on silicon, another absurdity as the atom doesn't lend itself to life-forming properties). ""Prometheus"" is yet another aspect to the ""Alien"" world giving us a new perspective on its origins, if you were interested at all to begin with (end with a prep, no no). The special effects are dazzling and Scott tantalizes us with another Gollum like creature in the pale alien voyager who would be almost good in a movie by himself. We can certainly believe his naked body is real in the opening scene and the erotic possiblities are endless when you consider the porn industry and CGI combined. However, the film is all too predictable and the ending totally improbable however talent and gifted its director is. See it for its special effects, skip through the gratuitous violence, and marvel at how far we've come in such a short time to create special effects that are quite spectacular - but they alone do not make a good or even an interesting film.

The first half of the movie had some problems, but I was still drawn in by the idea. But as soon as they landed on the alien world the movie took a wrong turn and kept getting going in the wrong direction. I think Ridley was allowed to do the movie ONLY if he sacrificed the second half of the movie to satisfy the Hollywood movie moguls who want to sell scary monsters and violence not lofty concepts and theories.

4770167,5,B005LAIHY0,"I'll make this simple. I heartily enjoy this movie.
When ""Aliens"" came out, I was perhaps too young to note whether or not people simply complained it wasn't ""scary"" like the original ""Alien"". I saw both when I was younger and ""Aliens"" was an action flick with some scare and ""Alien"" made me curious what was around the corner.
In as much as ""Alien"" isn't ""Aliens"", neither is ""Prometheus"" either of these two films. For me, ""Prometheus"" is a beatifully filmed prequel that leaves just as many questions as the original did. There are holes in the movie that have us wonder what else could be. It is this sticking point that I believe turned many off, and I have grown to accept that.
In this modern age many of us seem to want answers handed to us. Maybe in the simplest we just want some cookie for our commitment. I cannot completely disregard this. It's part of the human process. ""Prometheus"" however gave that to me by delivering an interesting tale that, to me, was about those questions.
This film is not perfect and this flaw is most observed in the plot. That aside however, the audio and visual of the movie is top notch. If you're on the fence about this movie I would suggest disregarding EVERYTHING people tell you, including the majority of my views. Go out and rent this movie. See for yourself. Does it matter that this is or isn't a prequel? You should watch it to determine how you feel about that.

Some profound ideas and subjects are introduced in the movie, but Scott seems to focus more on the horror elements.  Films with this ambition cannot help but be compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Unlike ""2001"" the characters do not behave like regular human beings facing a profound situation.

4770336,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ever since the initial trailer for `Prometheus' was released and the dynamic score (which is sadly NOT utilized in the film) overtook the scenes of apparent suspense and horror, I was driven by an insane sense of passion, to see this movie.  I'm a huge fan of the franchise, despite some of the later films falling off `so-to-speak', and Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors (the man has such range) and so to see him returning to the film that made him a household name (his 1979 `Alien' is still very much the best in the bunch) was something that made me really excited.

But life is busy and this is NOT a children's movie and so I never made it to the theater to see this.

That said, on a big screen at home with surround sound and the lights out, this is pretty impressive in its own right.  To place this up against the other films in the series is somewhat unnecessary but wholly expected and unavoidable and so to see the fans semi-disappointed and the critics throwing complaints at it, I wasn't surprised.  As a whole, I think `Prometheus' works well in the context of the type of film it is.  As for being something `more than that', I don't know if it was as successful.

`Prometheus' flirts with the idea of delivering to the audience answers or explanations to life's biggest questions.  Why are we here?  Who made us?  What is the purpose of life?  These are questions that everyone asks and so few feel as though they have a genuine answer to.  This is a hefty undertaking for a horror film to try and take on, and for the most part `Prometheus' kind of drops the ball entirely and without unapologetically at that.  It just doesn't seem to care that it never even attempts to answer these questions.  In fact, it basically leaves off where we started, with a certain individual intent on finding the answers to those questions.

And the journey repeats itself.

And then again, maybe that is the point.  Maybe the point being made by `Prometheus' is that there are no answers, at least not easy ones, to those questions and so man's life is spent in an endless circle of a journey trying desperately to uncover answers they will never fully grasp or understand.  When confronted with the opportunity to find out, they are met with hostility and irrational behavior and, in most cases death.  In `Prometheus' we find a group of people with varying ideas of what these answers are worth, and varying lengths they will go to uncover them.  Sadly, the open-ending leaves the viewer feeling almost jilted; betrayed by a promise of closure (especially for fans of the series expecting something provoking for a grand finale of sorts) and left with a taste of unresolved differences in our mouths.

And yet I don't hate this, and at the end of the day kind of love it.

Like I said, for the mere fact that `Prometheus' only flirts with this concept and then entirely gives it up in order to focus on the more mechanical aspects of the genre, I give it a pass.  It doesn't really want to be something deeper, we just wanted it to want to be.  Instead, it really wants to be an effects heavy horror film, and it delivers in spades there.  The suspense built is remarkable (that abortion scene alone is ridiculously effective), the special effects are spectacular, the production department had a field day creating these sets (that stun, by the way) and the overall development of certain key characters (David for one) is pitch perfect.  Rapace, Fassbender and Theron are fantastic here, delivering beautifully crafted characters that reach out further than the confines of the genre would suggest.

At the end of the day, the film works.  It may not be what we wanted, but it certainly should be what we expected.",1363910400,,3733,4.589743589743589

The myth makers have fallen short. Therefore, I must give the movie 4-stars.  There are certain racial tendencies in the movie.  For instance, the Engineers are suppose to be a superior species - our creators.  But then why do they act like such brutes?  We humans have to keep reminding the Robot that He is a Robot and therefore inferior when, in fact, he is the most interesting character - both the hero and the villan - and keeps the story going.  The moral of this story should be, ""We should love (and respect) our creation(s) as we love ourselves.""  The ultimate question - Why? Why do our Engineers want to kill us?

4770339,4,B005LAIHY0,"In January of 2012, I was asked by a friend if I knew of any big budget films that were coming out that year that were not either reboots, prequels, or sequels. In other words, did last year give us any original films, at all? Well yes, but they were pushed aside by all of the superhero flicks, new installments in the Bond and Bourne franchises, an adaptation of The Hunger Games, and the conclusion of The Twilight Saga, a film which was long-awaited by both teen girls and their boyfriends alike. There was only one film that I had seen a trailer for that appeared to be a fresh, new film. Prometheus, the mega sci-fi horror tale from none other than Ridley Scott. However, I was soon informed that this was actually Scott's prequel to his early hit, Alien, which as everyone recognizes now as one of the most popular franchises of the late 1970s and 1980s. I only thought I was excited about this film until I discovered that ABC's ""Lost"" producer Damon Lindelof was on board as the screenwriter. And with the entire ""questions shall be answered and secrets revealed"" theme of the posters and trailers...well, you can imagine any fan's reaction.

However, most of the reactions from audiences were bipolar. Many lauded it for its return to the franchise as well as its revolutionary special effects, while the rest complained that they left the theater with more questions than they had going in, as well as having multiple plot holes and errors. Many people asked after seeing the film, ""What should we think about Prometheus?"" and have received many answers. The film takes place in 2093 and follows the actions of two scientists named Shaw and Charlie (Rapace and Marshall-Green) who were hired by a major corporation after discovering multiple wall drawings from ancient civilizations, all depicting humans looking at an unknown constellation of stars. After much research, they found a system of actual planets way off in the boondocks of space that not only precisely matched the constellations found in the drawings, but which were deemed inhabitable for life. So being the sensible human beings that they are, they go on a mission for with a crew hired by their employer, Peter Weyland...who is actually Guy Pearce with a ton of bad make-up on to make him appear two hundred years old. They bring with them crew ready to be turned into alien food, along with Weyland's daughter (Theron) and the robot David (Fassbender). The team finds out that not only did these humanoid aliens, called Engineers, are the creators of the human race, but that the planet that they found was their military base. The Engineers kept stores full of containers that held sperm of a forerunner to the Xenomorphs, the traditional aliens from the Alien franchise. At least that is how it appears. As the film concludes, Shaw finds out that the Engineers had planned to infect Earth with the sperm in order to annihilate the human race, for reasons unknown to them. They find this out, after Charlie gets infected  by the Xeno-sperm and burned alive, two of the crew members get brutally killed by an alien, and Shaw conceives an alien from having sexual intercourse with the Charlie and is forced to perform surgery on herself to get it out. Woah.

For obvious reasons, I left the film weak in the knees. Prometheus is not exactly a popcorn flick. However, my first thought was, ""I wish Avatar had been more like this!"" Ridley Scott's special effects artists showed some phenomenal work in the design of the planet, along with the Engineers and pre-Xenomorphs. The haunting design of the planet was incredible to have seen in IMAX, with some shots simply breathtaking as well as frightening. For the special effects and production design alone, I believe that Prometheus made up for its mistakes. Of course, I would not be giving the film a fair and balanced review if I did not go through some of these errors.

There were three problems that I had with this film. The first was the whole presence of Peter Weyland. I felt that his character was completely unnecessary to the overall story, and even if he had to be included for some reason, why did it have to be kept a secret that he was still alive and in cryo-sleep? Would it have made Shaw and Charlie reluctant to go on the expedition with their employer breathing down their backs? Well, of course Weyland gives his reason, that he was days away from death, but wouldn't that be a cool theme to know from the beginning? A summary of the film could then be, ""A dying CEO who is also a visionary employs a pair of scientists to take him to the planet that the Engineers inhabited in order to meet his makers before he dies."" That sounds pretty awesome, if you ask me. And as I mentioned earlier, the make-up artists did a terrible job with turning Guy Pearce into an old man. If you have not seen Prometheus, just think of how bad Saito's aging process was done in Inception. I would say this was even worse. The next problem was more of Ridley Scott trying to make yet another tense scene for his film, and have Shaw and Weyland's daughter run away from the rolling Engineer bomber shuttle. There really isn't anything to say about this, other than it was stupid.

The third and final problem I had is not exactly with the film itself, but how so many people criticized it for having the David's plan appear impossible. I know, this sounds really strange, but keep reading. David takes one of the sperm canisters back to the ship (no one sees him do this), and he puts dips some of the substance into Charlie's drink while Charlie is watching him. But one could argue that in the context of the scene that Charlie was depressed and probably more than a little drunk, so I excuse this mistake that skeptics continue to bring up in arguments. However, the rest of his plan does work out, and is even logical in my mind. How did David know that Charlie and Shaw would have sex? Well he said not fifteen minutes later in the film that he knew that they were close, plus during the two year flight he was able to watch their dreams as much as he wanted, so I am sure he learned a thing or two about everyone on the Prometheus by the time they arrived. But how could he have possibly concluded that Shaw would get pregnant? My guess is that he did not, but he did know that all of the canisters in the caves were meant to be used on Earth. He is fluent in over two million forms of communications, remember, so reading the Engineers' writing on the walls wasn't too hard. When Shaw then becomes pregnant with the Alien, David then discovers what the master plan of the Engineers really was: to infect Earth with the alien sperm so the women would conceive the Xenomorphs, who would grow and transform into an army of destruction. The plan is actually ingenious, for as David told Shaw, ""Sometimes to create, one must first destroy."" So in reality, David was not trying to kill off the crew, even though he seemed to want it sometimes, like when he said ""Don't we all wish for our parents to be dead?"" He actually is not doing this, rather he was experimenting on the crew to find out to learn more about the Engineers and their motives. However, it is disquieting to know just how dark David really is, because he had to know that bringing the canister on board the ship could possibly harm everyone on board, including Weyland, his ""father,"" who was still in cryo-sleep. Michael Fassbender surely brought a lot to the table and added so much to David's character.

Prometheus is at its heart, a film about searching for the origin of man, and is a discussion of both philosophy and theology of the hierarchy of creators. The humans created the robots like David, but who created the human race? The Engineers. But were the Engineers created by someone? We shall see. I like Ridley Scott's feel for Prometheus better than that of Alien, although no one can deny that Alien is the better film. With a sequel being planned, Scott would be wise to learn from his mistakes and craft a new film with both the feel of Prometheus and the action and terror that will satisfy the older fans of the series.

It just doesn't have the excitement, pacing, or character development of Alien to which it was often compared.",1363824000,5,255,4.906976744186046
4770341,2,B005LAIHY0,"The 3D looked fantastic on my Panasonic plasma.  But, I found the movie to be very disapointing.  Everyone behaves stupidly.  There are a lot of recyled situations from the other Alien movies without much originality.  The basic underlying plot makes no sense.  The ending is terrible.  It was better than Alien 4, but not as good as Alien 3.",1363824000,3,342,4.711864406779661
4770342,4,B005LAIHY0,"I purchased this movie without having watched it in the theater, and knew very little about the moving going into it, other than the fact that the movie took place in the ""Alien"" franchise universe, and acted as a prequel of sorts.  The movie was AWESOME to watch in 3D, and had a fun story (with a few caveats).  I will not post anything in regards to the story, as I don't want to spoil it, but if you get the chance to watch the film you should definitely watch it in 3D, as the film was actually shot in 3D.  The special features were VERY well done, and I STRONGLY recommend watching them if you are a little confused after the story ends (just as I was), as it does explain a few things that are talked about in the movie.  I guess the last thing I'll say about the movie is that it does not answer all of the questions you have, which I actually think is a good thing, as Alien (1979) did not answer all of the questions either.",1363824000,,935,4.092896174863388

4770384,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott is a great director, so there is inherent quality about this production.  It was supposed to (or perhaps was imagined by many, myself included) be an explanation of unanswered questions left hanging from the original ""Alien"" film - like where did that alien spacecraft come from, why did it crash there, etc.  This movie did answer some questions, but raised others.  Ultimately I came to see that some, at least, of its shortcomings were because it was apparently designed as a two-part film, since at its end Naomi Rapice's character takes off to find the home planet of the Engineers.  However, while the crash of the alien spaceship is explained, the death of the pilot doesn't correspond with the body found in ""Alien"" and we are not sure if we've seen the postulated beginning of the scary aliens, or just another demonstration of their greatest stregth: adaptability.  I have to reserve final evaluation until I've seen Part II, whenever that comes out.",1363737600,,973,4.908536585365853

With solid acting all around, and the potential doomsday scenario revieled, this flick will be enjoyed by any sci-fi enthusist and even the casual movie watcher.

Good acting by Swedish Noomi Rapace (even if her ""British"" accent is very Swedish at times), and Michael Fassbender.

4770393,2,B005LAIHY0,"I wanted to like this movie. I have been waiting years for Ridley Scott to make another Alien movie, however, this movie was a total let down.  This movie has great production value and is expansive. It also has an interesting idea at its helm. But it doesn't live up to any of it. The plot is choppy and full of holes. The characters are paper thing. The monster at the end feels tacked on. And the scientist in the movie seem to be very stupid. What the hell was he thinking. I think the only reason this movies isn't universally panned is because Ridley Scott directed it and because people want a sequel that shows the alien homeworld. This is not a good movie.",1363737600,,665,4.32

4770480,4,B005LAIHY0,"I watched this movie in the theater. While it has its plot holes and is not what many people expected from a prequel, I think it is a good movie.

The story is a bit flimsy, but I'm not sure there is a way to set up the phenomenal movies of Alien and Aliens that wouldn't be flimsy. It is almost one of those back stories that is better off not filled in. Regardless, I knew going into it that an Alien prequel would be some tall shoes to fill. Besides, it is an action/suspense movie, I wasn't expecting an award winning screenplay.

Visually, the movie is very good. Many special effects were filmed the old fashioned way with puppets, wires, etc. and edited only slightly. This adds a nice touch compared to some movies where entire sequences are either blue screened or just pure CGI. The visual effects honestly reminded me of Terminator 2, the first A movie to have a lot of computer effects. Both movies used CGI sparingly and to great effect.

Despite some of the shortcomings of the movie, I like it and bought this at full price when it became available. There are only two real gripes I have about the movie.

The movie has an R rating due to a single scene near the end. If they were not going to edit or omit that scene to reduce the rating, why couldn't they make other scenes more gory and worthy of an R rating? It wouldn't have hurt.

Second, it takes suspension of disbelief to accept interstellar travel and other sci-fi elements in this movie. I am okay with that. I'll take quite a bit of sci-fi in a movie and be okay with it. Even a machine that can perform automated surgery... in the future! In space! Fine. But if a machine can perform surgery, why not go all the way and give it a laser that can cauterize and seal flesh instead of using staples I can buy at the store? For a real humorous take on this, youtube the honest trailer for this movie. See what a person can do after having surgery. Walking hurts: but running and rappelling is okay?

Anyway, I like the movie but can't give it five stars. It was good, but not on par with the original Alien and Aliens.",1363478400,2,2091,4.2944162436548226

4770520,5,B005LAIHY0,"a lot of people didn't enjoy this movie because it either didn't answer their questions, or it wasn't the prequel to Alien they were expecting. firstly, movies don't need to answer every question to be a good movie, how many unanswered questions to have to the first Alien, or  Blade Runner for that matter. secondly, it was never supposed to be a direct prequel. it takes place in the same universe and is meant to tie some of the same themes together, its a parallel story that runs along side the Alien series. some have argued that their are plot problems, but any movie, no matter how good can be picked apart in this way.

in any case, i bought this movie on sale for black friday and it was completely worth it, it was less than half price and for a fan of Ridley Scott, SciFi, or just anyone who wants to watch something interesting in both narrative and visual atmosphere, i recommend Prometheus!",1363305600,,905,4.4787878787878785

4770604,4,B005LAIHY0,"I loved the effects and acting , they were fantastic. I was a little fuzzy about the interview with the engineer .",1363305600,,114,4.2272727272727275
4770605,4,B005LAIHY0,"I've heard less than stellar things about Prometheus (although Claudia Gray seems to like it), but I still wanted to see it.  The trailers were fantastic and I love both Alien and Aliens.  I haven't seen the other films in the series, due to that hearing less than stellar things thing.

I think Prometheus had one major problem: it's philosophy isn't that interesting.  There is lots of listening to people talk about why humans were created and what their purpose is which is a question many people care about, but it's irrelevant to reality when the movie is proposing the answer lies with giants in space.  Plus, the scientists have zero evidence for believing the aliens are benevolent creators, rather than people who just happened to visit Earth.  And yet that plot takes up almost half of the movie.

Many people forget the pacing of Alien, how long it takes before a facehugger appears and then a guy gets his chest busted open.  The fault in Prometheus is not that the aliens don't appear soon enough, but that what happens before the aliens appear is pseudoscientific nonsense and pseudophilosophical babble.  And Prometheus does improve exponentially once the aliens appear and people start worrying more about survival than the origins of humanity.

The casting is fantastic.  Noomi Rapace is beatific and miles away from her fierce, star-making role as Lisbeth Salander.  Michael Fassbender is strangely inhuman and quietly furious at his own creators.  Charlize Theron manages to make herself a plausible villain despite doing nothing truly villainous and being one of the most competent people in the movie.  (Everyone in Prometheus makes at least one dumb, out of character mistake.  Why is the geologist who maps the cave and can pinpoint his coordinates the one who gets lost?)  And Idris Elba is fantastic as always and injects some real personality into the Prometheus's crew.

Prometheus could be much, much worse.  But as sci-fi horror goes, it is no Alien.  It does not live up to the promise of its trailer.  However, I can fast forward through the worst babbling scenes to enjoy the true scares the second half of the film delivers.",1363219200,,2158,4.925207756232687
4770606,2,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott is tapped out, time to retire. I actually felt sorry for the actors; imagine how excited they were to get on board a film directed by The Famous Ridely Scott!  This film is evidence of how even good actors can't save a disastrous plot and helpless script.  It's too bad Mr. Scott didn't consult with me prior to making this epic dog pile.  This would've been my advice:

1) DO NOT do another Alien movie!  That signature franchise is tapped out. Do something completely different. Surprise your audience, come up with some fresh ideas or new approaches to old themes.

2) You HAD the basis for something interesting during the film's five minute opening. It was beautiful, stunning and mind-blowing imagery up until the moment when the dude drank the black goop then disintegrated in the water.

3) Make spaceship interiors look like REAL spaceships!  Aliens #1 & #2 were much more believable, as were the sets for Battlestar Galactica or Firefly.  Try visiting the next closest thing we have to a spaceship with a large crew -- an aircraft carrier or, better yet, a submarine. Maybe watch Das Boot a couple of times, maybe you'll get an idea of what it's like to have 100 people living in a 300-ft long, 30-ft wide iron tube for months at a time.

4) Never waste a character!  ALL characters are important, even if they're going to be killed off half-way through the film; they all have stories, give them real relationships with other crew members.  I'm reminded of the famous squad of Colonial Marines from Aliens #2 -- their performance as a unit made the whole movie work, they made it believable. Professionals doing their jobs right up until the very end, not a bunch of panty-wastes sitting around blubbering about the terrible alien monsters.

I'll give this film a charitable 2-star rating for its stunning imagery and CGI.",1363219200,3,1846,4.73125
4770607,3,B005LAIHY0,"Not bad story line and concept but, no comparison to the original Alien. Price was right, .99 cents, so no complaints.",1363219200,,118,4.666666666666667
4770608,2,B005LAIHY0,"My first thought was to generously give this movie three stars, on the basis that: while it is similar (but inferior) to Alien, it is much more ambitious. The defense of the poor execution and conception would be in the degree of difficulty (in telling a survival-horror story against a SF-creation-myth backdrop). But that defense doesn't wash, because the SF story is a fake-out: we ultimately understand as little about the universe of Prometheus as we do about the Alien. Since there actually is no explanation here, there can be no justification for ending up with a story as loose and floppy as this one. Perhaps Ridley Scott wants to make a more cerebral type of movie now; if this is the outcome, then I think that decision is a pity. Alien feels tense, urgent, and mysterious & has a definite point of view. I didn't love it, but it's an excellent movie. Prometheus resolves to the same type of hidden danger creature feature, but without those qualities and with: empty pretension, meaningless character detail, and (unintentional?) comedy where a ""climax"" involves outrunning a spaceship. I watched it through to the end partly to find the (non-existent) answers, but mostly because Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron play their characters as though they might develop into something interesting (they do not). But where I was watching, everyone else gave up halfway through (and I can't blame them).

It seems to be an ambitious failure, but I have to ask why such an ambitious failure is necessary. Apparently, Ridley Scott was always surprised that fans weren't keen to know the origin of the original alien humanoids. The explanation for that is very simple: it's cooler not to explain everything (especially if it turns out to be this, or midi-chlorians).",1363219200,3,1775,4.976430976430977

Audio:  DTS HD Master Audio 7.1.

The video quality was fantastic.  I do not currently have a 3D TV.

The 7.1 sound was also fantastic - lots of sound to all the speakers, almost too much bass at times channeled to the sub-woofers (the room shook).  I could tell the difference between sound on the side surround speakers, and the rear surrounds, which I don't always notice on 7.1 movies.

Usually, in a good movie, you can identify with and either like or despise the characters. You should be able to find at least one character with whom you are sympathetic and root for to win. For me, this movie did not have one. This type of movie always demands the viewers suspension of disbelief. In this case, I never really believed in any of the characters or many of the situations. Especially, the lead female who ended the movie getting out of a surgical machine after having been cut open from one side to the other and then ""stapled"" back together who then proceeds to get out of the machine and except for a few contrived ""pain swoons"" function almost normally. The concern here is that the medical technology given for this operation was incredibly lacking in believeability. Really... staples?
And, for my final rant, what's with all of these blockbuster movies with ""stereo"" sound. Come on Amazon, would you have us believe that this thing was released in stereo and not 5.1?

Just to clarify my demographic, I am well into my retirement now and was there when the original Alien was released. When I commented on the original Alien I said that the reaction of those in the theater was spectacular and we all realized that we had just witnessed  a very special film.  My opinion is that Ridley Scott has equaled or exceeded his origin Alien vision.

I have also kept up with the franchise over the years by seeing all the Alien spinooffs (like the Alien vs Preditor series which I didn't like too much). Prometheus on DVD viewed very well on my 52"" HDTV and watching this new movie was as unique an experience as watching the original Alien and I viewed it three times serially! Now that I have seen it I know I would like to see it again on Blu-Ray for the slightly superior screen quality and the information contained on the total of four disks.

Again it did not dissapoint except for being left open for a sequel.  I have seen the various chat sites at which dedicated Alien fans have left their opinions and suggested some plots for a possible Prometheus 2 after the gears of our legal system grind out to their conclusion.

It has fine actors and a superb director.

But almost everything is wrong with it.

It has no suspense, unscary monsters, a dull plotline, bad writing, and (I never thought I'd say this about Ridley Scott) lame direction.

Michael Fassbender is well-cast as David, the android.  He has those plastic, not quite human, good looks.  But his acting is somnolent.  His monotone and expressionless face get irritating fast.

Noomi Rapace is a victim of her makeup and the writing.  For some reason, somebody decided to put awkward, slightly shrunk, lipstick on her, making her look like a 3-year-old who got into mommy's stuff.  As for her character, it is stiff, one-dimensional, and not credible.

Charlize Theron phones her part in.  She is supposed to play the unfeeling robotic Corporation woman, but she simply prances aggressively here and there and spouts badly written lines once in a while.

The humanoid aliens, from the very first scene, are annoying.  They appear to be made of wax.  They move clumsily, and have sock-puppet expressions.

Even the CGI in this movie is bad.  Perhaps they spent all their money on the big names, but the effects are impoverished and unreal.

This movie could have been superb--an exciting, dark prequel to Alien.  Instead it is just a B- or C- or even D-movie.

I actually had to call and talk to a live person at Fox, so hopefully this will help.  If you want to download to iTunes, the steps remind me of a computer equivalent to the multiple doors at the Get Smart headquarters from the old TV show.  First, insert the digital copy disc into your disc drive on your computer.  Second, go to your Computer program and select the DVD and right click and Open. Third, double click on DVDROM.  Fourth, double click to opent Media Manager.  Fifth, at the bottom of the list is MediaManagerII.exe.  Sixth, double click on that and it will open a box for fox digital copy.  There you will have three more steps to follow!  Sixth, enter the code from the DVD insert and then at step 2 pick iTunes for the platform.  Step 3 will give you the actual code you need to enter in iTunes, so copy and paste it into the redemption code box in the iTunes store.  Then, click your heels three times and say ""There's no place like iTunes"" three times.  By then, it should start downloading.

We both LOVE Alien. Kinda like Alien 2. Disappointed with 3, but didn't hate. Was intrigued with the 4th. Won't even dignify a response with 5 and 6.

So we couldn't wait for our favorite director to do Prometheus - the beginning of the Alien series, we are told. Yeah!!!!

I can never get the time I spent or money I spent on this dreadful piece of crap back. Great looking home ship and new world. Horrible story - was there a story? What was the story? Is there a story? What's the story. Did I miss the story. Story? What was this movie? Was it a movie or was it a boring dream. What?  This was my whole experience within the theater's 4 walls where I felt trapped while trying to discover if there was a story to this so-called movie. And it was long. I love good long movies. This was a bad long movie.

So it's something about finding a planet because of pictures on cave walls on earth and they decide that it is the beginning of man kind. And then some rich guy - always some really rich guy - how lame. Easy. Come on. Anyway, so rich guy makes it possible to build a spaceship and send a crew to this planet and the crew goes into this structure where their is O2 and then they get sick and then someone turns into an alien like thing at the end - of course the rest of the crew turn into stuff too - like an experiment - everyone turns into artillery experiments - woe man, cool, did you see that guy turn into a creature for destruction?? And then the Alien creature thing that was a man but is now Alien and then years from now there are all sorts of Aliens on this other planet with eggs everywhere- Alien is born ..Wow, the whole beginning of the series, thank you for giving us this stupid explanation. And then 2 spaceship crash - woe, did you see that?? Two spaceships crashing - man, cool. Oh and did you see Charlene Theron doing push ups, man cool, woe. That's about it. Oh and some alien human huge giant guy has something to do with it all - you just can't figure it out - like he is all angry and mad and rageful and wants to maybe destroy earth, they think?

At whiles it  becomes ridiculous: dr Shaw's bloody cesarean, after which she is immediately able to run, fight, etc! Weyland's presence on board, to a very flimsy end indeed. Bitchy female Vicker's medical pod geared for a male patient only. And revealed to be Weyland's manipulating daughter. Charlie Holloway poisoned by android David, why? Ah, wait: so he can engross his girl friend with an octopoid fetus that ultimately invades the interstellar humanoid and causes him to spawn the Alien? David, reduced to a bodiless head, capable of steering the alien spaceship to the actual origin planet of mankind? Gee, is there a limit to stretching the suspension of disbelief?

4771232,5,B005LAIHY0,"This movie was a great prequel to the classic sci-fi horror movies from back in the day.  Special effects and audio effects were top notch.  I would definitely recommend checking this movie out, even if you already watched it in the theater.",1361836800,,241,4.714285714285714
4771293,5,B005LAIHY0,"The credits list Ridley Scott for good reason. The premise of human life stemming from ""off world"" sources is not new but this movie tells it well. The FX are perfect, the story is easy to follow, the Aliens tie-in is not too obvious but definately intact.

I liked all the Alien(s) films so it follows that I enjoyed this one too.",1361836800,,331,4.338709677419355
4771294,5,B005LAIHY0,"This prelude to Alien answered the lead-in questions very well, while posing new questions about who these being are.  Like Alien, this movie provided some classic sci-fi visuals/scenes, that for me, set the standard for sic-fi movies.",1361836800,,235,5.351351351351352

4771297,2,B005LAIHY0,I guess if you liked alien then go for it.  The whole thing was one disaster after another and it wasn't pretty lol.  I felt like the actual story was a little weak.,1361836800,,165,3.9696969696969697
4771298,3,B005LAIHY0,"Story is a bit cliche'.  Somewhat predictable.  Special effects and sound are excellent so, go for the HD version.

4771300,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus definitely falls into the ""old school"" of science fiction, where its up to the viewer to draw up their own conclusions about what they are seeing.  Even the film's weaknesses, such as the use of Vickers, a couple of action set pieces, etc., are offset by the film's beauty and solid pacing.

Prometheus was not what many were expecting, and that's one reason why I admire the film as much as I do.  Not many directors can tell stories visually like Ridley Scott can.

This film is also a victim of a lot of reviewers looking for something wrong with it.  If you're looking for flaws in films, you're going to find them.  I find it laughable that Avatar has higher critical marks than this film, even though that film is essentially Dances With Wolves on an alien planet, with great effects.  Prometheus is something original, and what's better is that its evident that Ridley Scott had a great time making it.  I highly recommend this.",1361836800,,946,4.622754491017964

4771355,2,B005LAIHY0,"People overhyped this movie. It's got good effects, sets. and atmosphere but it takes far to long to get going and so is similar to the original in a negative way.",1361750400,,163,4.290322580645161
4771356,4,B005LAIHY0,"...I certainly didn't expect that; overall, this was a good movie; couple of the characters are predictable and stock, and thus less enjoyable; some are distastefully shallow (but then, I've met my share of those, too); special effects are good... I'm not overly critical of science fiction movies, because I love the genre, and especially because of all the dreadful ones I saw in my childhood and early adult years.  This one's definitely a keeper, as is almost anything Ridley Scott directs, but I wouldn't put this near the top of his efforts.",1361750400,,547,4.881720430107527
4771357,3,B005LAIHY0,"This film is marred by a couple of gigantic plot holes, and it's not a very satisfying prequel to Alien. I think also that I've never seen another film that's more clearly intended to set up a sequel; even the Harry Potter movies provide more closure at the end. In spite of the problems, though, Ridley Scott is such a master of making gorgeous-looking cinema that it's worth watching. Michael Fassbender's performance as the childlike android is also a highlight.",1361664000,,465,4.825
4771358,4,B005LAIHY0,"The ALIEN movie series began as a stunner (Alien), led to a great action movie (Aliens), then slid into fair effects, dismal sets and lighting, and some plot silliness in both Alien 3 and Alien 4.
Although not presented as a true prequel, Prometheus imagines some interesting origins for the full storyline, and utilizes well-done special effects. The only thing I found rather unlikely was the lead character, played by Noomi Rapace, doing remarkable athletic stunts right after having doing a major operation on herself! There are limits in suspending belief, even in a belief-suspending movie like Prometheus! But it's fun, none-the-less.",1361664000,,641,5.294117647058823

4771413,3,B005LAIHY0,I guess I was expecting more given the subject and producer. I had been jonsing to watch this ever since seeing the first trailer/commercial on line before it came out. In all it was pretty formulaic and there weren't many surprises. In fact there was only one unexpected bit of verbal play. The plot 'twists' were easy to guess fairly quickly. It wasn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours but I'm glad I didn't pay full price in the theatre.,1361664000,,444,4.36144578313253

4771415,1,B005LAIHY0,It is a cheap ripoff of Aliens with bad acting and a convaluted script. Dont waste your time or money.,1361664000,,102,4.15
4771416,2,B005LAIHY0,"This movie disappointed me. I am a huge fan of sci-fi, and love films about exploring space, first contact, etc. I thought the cast was kind of wasted. The photography was very dark. The subject matter was dark. This movie was about searching for the origins of humanity in space. There was so much potential. I feel like an opportunity was missed to say something uplifting and profound. Instead it was the usual characters creeping around in the dark and encountering a lot of gore. There is obvious potential for a sequel. In the right hands, it could be much more interesting.

4771418,3,B005LAIHY0,"Less answers than you would expect. While I was hoping this would give more insight to the aliens as a whole, and to the history of the aliens universe. It leaves more questions than answers and for it to fit perfectly into the aliens universe there has to be a part two. There's no question about that. Even though it's a (first half it seems) prequel it left far more questions than answers. Did it answer what the aliens are, yes. Did it answer how they got to their current form? no and when you compare face huggers you'll know that it has a long way to go. Overall it was ok. But I was satisfied with one watch of it.",1361577600,,623,4.1570247933884295

4771421,1,B005LAIHY0,"This film is right near the top of my personal worst movies of all time list.  It's noting more than a self-conscious remake of Alien (oooh! a humanoid android talking severed head with fluid dripping down its chin--what a clever reference Ridley!) as well as being a prequel.  Full of non sequiturs, inconsistencies, contradictions, plot holes, and cardboard characters. It's not good sci fi.  It's not even a good horror movie.",1361491200,,429,5.014084507042254

4771553,5,B005LAIHY0,"I hate that stores charge so much for the 3D format.  Best Buy doesn't even have some of the titles.  Thanks Amazon!  Anyway, if you don't like sci fi leave this on the shelf.  For those who are fans of Alien franchise, you will love it.  If you are just into Sci fi, you very well might like the film.  The extras are nice and the outtakes are enjoyable.  This version has lots of extras and the movie on my family's new 3D screen is breathtaking.
Oh and for about $20?  Perfect.  Now the other 3D movies just need to come down in price.",1361491200,,538,4.096153846153846
4771554,4,B005LAIHY0,"Though many of the developments in this movie don't make a lot of sense, it still resonates with the great science fiction classics. It holds our attention with an unfamiliar world and the suspense of waiting to find out what it means for us. The technology is cool and the film does have a small amount of depth lent by the mythology reference and the psychological projections of the main characters. But I am getting tired of the HR Giger sets and the cavalier group dynamics that these Ridley Scott space movies always have. I was looking for Blade Runner and got another Alien.",1361491200,2,582,4.605769230769231

4771561,1,B005LAIHY0,"This movie really sucked.  There's barely a plot and it's poor at best.  It keeps paying homage to Alien, and really who cares?  How about creating a decent movie in it's own right?  Save your money.",1361318400,,199,4.444444444444445

4771625,3,B005LAIHY0,"First of all, the movie looks great streaming to my TV (rented the standard def version).  Originally, I didn't think I'd have much to lose, except my valuable time, if the other reviewers who panned the movie were right.  I liked Aliens I and II (III horrible, AvP eh), and so convinced myself I should watch this.

Yes, the characters are pretty flat and not at all interesting to follow.  Mostly standard hollywood portrayals.  The robot is the only interesting character to watch.

The plot is okay, and what I found most fascinating was how they made the Engineers to be very humanoid.  I braced myself for a lot of stupidity from the crew based on the previous reviewers comments.  Yeah, they were dumb in many respects, but the movie ended up not being as bad as I thought it would.  With such blase and stereotypical characters, it was hard to expect them to deviate from their expected roles.

Maybe think of it as more an action scifi film, and suspend a healthy amount of disbelief --> then you'll be good to go.  Otherwise, you're probably better off just spending the time doing some household chores.

Did anyone else the spaceship had a lot of similar characteristics to Firefly's Serenity?",1361232000,,1205,4.685714285714286
4771626,2,B005LAIHY0,"I side with the other reviewers who call this movie a waste of time. It's long and boring. There's not much story. Mankind's first mission to another planetary system is crewed by narcissistic punks. In classic Jurassic Park fashion, they go where they shouldn't, do dumb things and get killed. A comic book has better characters. Where is the plot and charm and suspense of the previous Alien films?

There are pretty costumes and matte backgrounds from Space Family Robinson.  The boss alien resembles the Michelin Man. He collects black oil from the X-Files, gets raped by an octopus, and their kid looks like H.R. Giger's classic conehead. Must be a black sheep in the family.

Let's hope humanity's real ambassadors are better than this. Let's hope Hollywood can do better than this.",1361232000,,788,4.909774436090226
4771627,5,B005LAIHY0,"To me this movie has an excellent sense of exploration and wonder.  It looks great, and there's enough action mixed with the mystery to keep things moving along.  Plus, you get the obligatory Alien corporate tool to provide a readymade villain.  Much goes unexplained, but so what?  The alien race has no desire or need to explain their motivations to us, so that's that.  Looks like it's headed for a sequel - or at least they set up the possibility.

I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and as it stands it's a good bookend to the Alien series.",1361232000,,544,4.444444444444445
4771628,4,B005LAIHY0,I actually enjoyed this movie. I would recommend this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon! Grab the popcorn and some friends...have fun!,1361232000,2,133,5.090909090909091
4771629,4,B005LAIHY0,"For all the slash and gore freaks out there who wanted just another horror flick: I don't feel your pain but I do understand it. This is a movie with a real plot based on philosophical questions that appeal to the minds of all thinking people: where did we come from and who created us? The slash & gore freaks don't get it. This movie borrows from Alien to illustrate a concept, which is the notion that the origin of the human race is a horror story. This is based on ideas that go back to the ancient Gnostics and Sumerians. They had myths that explained human origins along similar lines. The gist of the story is that humans weren't created by a noble supreme Being for noble purposes; instead humans were created by malevolent, demonic beings.

But aside from the fascinating theme behind the film, this movie has good acting, good characters, it's not slow and doesn't waste your time. Is it Star Wars or Avatar? No. But it is still a good and entertaining film filled with eye-popping photography, inspiring images and good acting. Could it be better? A little. But the main problem with this movie is that IT LACKS A SEQUEL. This movie needs a sequel and we need it NOW!!!

Also, I'm tired of Ridley Scott getting paddled over this film by critics who have no experience making movies themselves. Again, it's not a bad movie at all. And I wish they would keep Ridley Scott and give him a chance to finish this project and to improve upon the foundation laid in part I. I hope part II doesn't turn out to be another dumb slash & gore movie. There's a great plot here and Ridley Scott should be allowed to finish the job.

I have this movie in my library along side Star Wars, Avatar and the Chronicles of Riddick; and I think that's exactly where it belongs.",1361232000,3,1766,4.427692307692308

That's exactly what this movie is all about, it draws you in with a fair amount of unknowns, and slowly reveals a few things, and then reveals absolutely nothing about the plot of the movie itself.  In the end, this movie finds itself back at the beginning.  If you like chasing rainbows, this movie is for you, because there is absolutely no pot of gold, or end of the rainbow here, just some pretty eye candy and special effects with a very thin story.",1361145600,,613,4.446428571428571

Wouldn't they have figured out ahead of time to be wary?  Isn't skepticism a primary rule of a good scientist?  The captain of the ship come on to and sleeps with the bosses daughter.  These morons set themselves up for defeat.  So many classic movie cliches are played - ie they get split up, communications break down- that the overarching themes which could have been dug deep are lost cause the audience is frustrated at the foolish antics of the characters.

Originally it was intended to be a prequel to Alien, but Ridley Scott decided to make it a stand alone film.  It didn't stand very well.

It does however offer a contrived, derivative storyline with a plot that is very similar to the original Alien. Seen that. Done that. Why bother?",1360800000,2,429,4.180722891566265

Visually it is spectacular, but the story and the execution is flawed on a grand scale.  Also, there isn't a single likeable character in the whole film.  Some are made out to be villains, but we don't know why.  The previous Alien movies all had very solid, very memorable characters.",1360800000,4,532,4.422680412371134

Highly recommended .",1360713600,,194,4.0
4771908,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott had a bar that was set very high for this semi-prequel to Alien. Scott does not disappoint. The result was a sweeping epic with fantastic visuals and an unexpected homage to the sci-fi genre. For the discerning eye, there were scenes that were reminiscent of Star Wars, Star Trek, 2001 - A Space Odyssey, Aliens, X-Files, The Thing, and probably a few more I didn't catch. The very first scene was surprising and thought provoking, and the last scene was the closest connection to Alien the movie presented, beyond the iconic images already shown in the previews.

A very long but never boring adventure, it showcased the great acting talents of Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish ""Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy and Michael Fassbender, the best android of the Alien films. Charlene Theron continues to amaze as the best ""ice queen"" in movies today.

The film isn't perfect. It stretches the bounds of believability in several areas. Why do two of the ""scientists"" freak out when seeing an ""alien"" corpse but have no problem confronting the live ""thing"" that would make most of us run for cover? Noomi Rapace has a scene that shows she can portray pain-in-action as good as Bruce Willis in Die Hard, but then has action sequences that suspend disbelief more than Willis running on tattered feet.

You don't get the slow-paced, dread and suspense of the original Alien or Blade Runner. This has way more action, gore and crowd-pleasing scenes. But it is nonetheless a film that will become a most-see films for genre fans.",1360713600,2,1528,4.846743295019157

4771953,1,B005LAIHY0,"I can't describe how bad this movie was. Others have done so. Nevertheless I must weigh in. The Trailer's for this film had me on the edge of my seat. I thought for certain this was going to be a billion dollar hit. The answers to thirty years of wondering would finally be answered.

What we got instead was a bait and switch and plot holes large enough to fly a Star Destroyer through.

Let's start with the bait and switch. The imagery from the commercial leads one to believe that we will find out who the 'space jockey,' as he's known was and how his ship came to crash on LV426. But very soon in the film we learn this is not LV426 so this can't be the space jockey from Alien.

They tricked us!

With regards to the plot holes, I won't go into all of them, (my lunch break is only an hour). But seriously, a crew of scientists spend a few years and 1 trillion dollanrs getting to an alien planet and are about to enter a structure obviously built by intelligent life, yet nobody is allowed to bring a weapon?

And the guy who maps out the alien space ship can't find his way off the space ship?

I can mapquest my way to Dunkin Donuts to within 1/10th of a mile. And they're in the future!

In screen writing 101 (which I took) the teacher would circle the above passages and mark on your paper 'lazy writing.' Or 'Not logical.' Then he'd tell you to try harder.

I could go on but why bother. Another thing that disturbed me was how people made statements like 'people didn't get it.' Or, 'Some viewers just couldn't understand what was going on.'

Right. I'm stupid. Not the people in the movie.

Then they said something like, 'all your questions will be answered in the next film.'

Not for me they won't.

Just my opinion

4772062,3,B005LAIHY0,"Okay, first, The Bad: Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce. Both excellent actors, trapped in odd casting and poor scripting. Charlize Theron was supposed to be some intimidating power-bitch, but instead she came across as flat and stale, and I found myself just irritated with her dry delivery for every scene in which she appeared. Guy Pearce: normally love this guy, but why on earth did they feel the need to cast him as a hundred year old man? It's as bad as Jim Carrey as the Grinch or Mike Myers as Cat in the Hat (yes, I realize those are both Dr. Seuss references and yes I mean what I say in comparing them to this). Essentially, why put a big-name actor inside so much makeup (very bad makeup) that you can't even tell it's the big-name actor? No hate on Guy Pearce, but it would have been simpler and more authentic with, uh, a real old guy.

The Okay/Good: The story was interesting, and while it bore many resemblances to Alien, it was different enough to feel original (and only as the film went on did I realize just how intentional these ties to the Alien mythos were. Keep in mind, I hadn't read anything up on this movie before watching it). The pacing was a bit off only because things take a while to get moving in the start, but then the climax felt rushed and not fully fleshed out, nor fully explained. Secondly, the viewer only cares (marginally) about a few of the characters; the rest are not much more than your typical rambunctious-obviously-going-to-be-killed-first-expendable-crewmen-types. BUT, this is to be expected material in the sci-fi/semi-military genre.

The Great: This movie is very, very pretty. Watching it on Blu-Ray looked fantastic, from the opening sequence of landscape fly-bys to the rich and textured sets within the cave/ship. The CG looked excellent, especially when Fassbender's character unlocks the big pretty universe-planning map thing within the large ship chamber (don't you love my sophisticated vocab in that last sentence?). That's another thing: Michael Fassbender. If I was gay, I would so bang him. In fact, I probably would anyway. He's quite a diverse actor, and plays an excellent android; handsome, detached, fascinated, and eloquent. Also, Noomi Rapace is an exceptionally affecting actress. She plays a woman in extreme distress quite well, and there's plenty for her to be stressed about in this picture. The, ahem, `birthing' scene is squirm-worthy, but brilliant for it's intensity.

Overall, tons of fun. Even though it tried in a sudden, last-minute way to throw in some sort of deep, creational/human destiny elements that just fell quite short, it was still a very enjoyable film, and a respectable piece of sci-fi cinema.",1360454400,,2695,4.918681318681319

The 3D is good, while not exploiting it.  Since I just got my first 3D TV, I would like a movie that does take it to the limit!  I expected 3D to be gimmicky.  What I discovered is it is natural and 2D is dull!  After all, we have two eyes, so we see in 3D.

4772198,2,B005LAIHY0,"I wanted to like this movie. The original Alien is one of my top 10 favorite movies and set the standard for gritty realism in sci-fi. Why then did Ridley Scott resort to directing a big-budget, cliche-ridden, Hollywood bloatbuster? I was deeply disappointed. Where the characters in the original Alien practiced some semblance of scientific decorum, the crew in Prometheus runs around like buzzed high schoolers, ripping off their helmets in questionable environments, opening secure doors for infected crew members, petting hissing alien snakes, infecting other crew members with alien goo and committing to a suicide mission after a one second explanation from someone who's clearly under duress. In other words, they blindly do the very things likely to get them killed in a gratuitous manner. And these people were supposed to be responsible for a trillion dollar mission.

The larger problem with Prometheus is the severely muddled plotline. The ""Engineers"" created life on Earth and left clues for our distant ancestors on how to find them, but they seem none too happy to see us when we finally show up. They immediately rip the head off of our best model android. BTW, do all android come with perforation lines around their necks so that all their heads rip off easily like a Bounty select-a-size paper towel? Rumor has it that the first draft of Prometheus, written by John Spaihts adhered more closely to the ""Alien"" universe and dealt more with the Xenomorphs, but suffered from pacing problems. So they brought in Damon Lindelof of ""Lost"" fame to spiff up the script. Why they thought bringing in a writer who penned and produced an entire television series that made no sense would help, I don't know.

One final note. In the transition from Spaihts script to Lindelof's, most of the character played by Charlize Theron (Meredith Vickers)must have been left on the cutting room floor because her character is utterly pointless. She should have been cut from the film entirely and her screen time used to better explain the backstory.",1359936000,2,2048,5.020588235294118

Comments and Concerns:
1. The talents of Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce were underutilized.
2. The scientist on the mission displayed some extremely unprofessional behavior that proved to have fatal
  consequences. For example, getting lost in tunnels that were already scouted by drones and assuming that
  some alien creature, that resembled a King Cobra and not some fuzzy Koala Bear, was not a threat. Come on
  man!
3. Why would they take off their protective helmets in some completely unknown environment?
4. If something extremely tall, heavy, and narrow is falling over you, only Wile E. Coyote would be stupid enough not
  run to the side so that imminent doom could be avoided.
5. Ok, the kamikaze scene was not well written. What are they chances that 3 out of 4 would be so ready for such
  a  heroic finish.  I could understand the captain going down with the ship but anyone else gets a get of jail free
  card - so to speak.
6. How did the bodyless android fly the alien ship without a body?

4772303,5,B005LAIHY0,"I found this to be a wonderful, deeply philosophical action movie that leads us to think about our own existence , our uniqueness in the universe and our ultimate relevance. I think many have a problem because the role of God is left to our speculation, but this actually elevates Deity beyond human understanding--just where It should be. The feeling of aloneness this leaves makes us shudder before the Here and Now. Our immediate progenitors are spacemen who apparently have scorn for us and want to wipe us out, to denude Earth of human life. Strong as they are, they are mortal, and they can be eaten alive just as humans have been in previous Alien films by something they wished to use to wipe out humanity.

Yes, humans perform some silly deeds in this film--just as humans often do. We wouldn't have tragedy if humans always acted  perspicaciously. The point is that we're human, and although we can be brilliant, we can also be very impulsive and foolish. I don't see that the plot shows anything other than human fallibility and a fragility of intellect under the pressure of emotions such as fear, lust for power and superiority and sexual abandon. Finally, we are led to ask why we are here, why our ""engineers"" (creators) have found us wanting and where do we go from here? Where are you, God? We need you!

The 3-D is glorious, the effects stupendous. I couldn't have asked for more. I saw it with an adult goddaughter who had asked to see it, and she couldn't stop saying ""wow!"". I think that, if you've seen this in 2-D, you owe it to yourself to see it in 3-D. The PQ is sharp, clear, revealing of detail, and the audio is perfect. We played it on my Oppo on a 55"" passive system  LG with a 7.1 home theater setup. Much better than being in the theater.

Don't let the naysayers dissuade you. This is a truly fine film which will ultimately rank up there with Ridley's best. It makes us long to know how we can somehow make ourselves count for more than ""teardrops in the rain"".",1359849600,3,1996,4.472527472527473

4772306,1,B005LAIHY0,"special effects were amazing.. but i was embarrassed to hear that Ridley Scott just wanted ""have fun"" while making this movie.  Well, Ridley, if you wanted to ""have fun"" while making a movie and have millions of people pay their hard earned cash to watch it?  Why not just YouTube yourself while riding a go-cart for 2 hours and yelling ""Weeeeeee!"" at the top of your lungs at certain intervals to keep us entertained.

Using the 2 scientists who were fatally attacked by the alien white snakes was actually supposed to be ""comic relief"" according to the director.  Makes sense!  Why else would a ""scientist"" that is lost in a bunch of dark tunnels on an alien planet use his helmet as a holder for bong smoke?

And let's use the old cliches:

""We're going to explore a possibly hostile planet - but you better NOT carry your weapons! you don't know what might be out there!""

the white alien snakes:  The moment i saw them hunting down the scientists, i knew EXACTLY where they were headed: up some one's As&*&* or down someone's throat.  Since watching Slither/Night of the Creeps, it was inevitable..

Another cliche:  Hey, i'm bored - let's have sex!

And let's talk about the impossible:

5 circles with people pointing at them crudely drawn on cave walls.  some pointing right - some pointing left.

from these crude drawings - a course was plotted 300 hundred TRILLION miles away. How in the hell do they know which way to go?  this takes place in 2089. Folks - we're in 2012 already.  My GPS system RE-ROUTES 10 miles after giving it instructions. And here, they're plotting a course, from DRAWINGS.. on a CAVE WALL..written in CRAYON.. of 5 circles..which THEY decided is 300 TRILLION MILES AWAY.. yeah.. okay..

For all we know those people could have been pointing at 5 turds that refused to flush - and they needed an intergalactic plumber to help them.  They WERE standing at a distance from the circles, if you hadn't noticed.

Another impossibility:  Running at break-neck speed with Charlize Theron after a cesarean birth. Charlize Theron can run - and to try keeping up with her after an operation? okay...

Oh, yeah, and a vindictive android.  that just took the cake, Ridley.. no, let's add ICING to ""said"" cake. a vindictive android - that dyes his hair because he admires Peter O'toole, and watches Lawrence of Arabia...

As for the disc itself, there are a lot of extended and/or cut scenes in the extras section that they really should have been redited into the film as a director's cut. There is a lot of backstory in these scenes and they would have made the story richer, for sure.

Regardless, the picture and sound quality are great and Michael Fassbender is a complete scene-stealer as the android David.

In that vein, Prometheus is a stupid man's idea of what a smart film is like.

The constant comparisons to 2001 are ludicrous, as if by having a space-guy dissolve himself into a body of water and then not answering why is somehow ""deep"". The argument I make is that the film isn't actually mysterious nor intelligent but actually completely dumb. Add lazy as well...if you are going to be ""smart"" and ""deep"", don't waste time on useless story bits and dues ex plot movement just to move to the next scene. Put effort into it.

I'm not going to rehash over everything that everyone else has said, suffice to say that the film could have been just as mysterious and beautiful without the terrible story thrown in. The roles that fill little purpose and do not move the story forward; the ""gotcha"" moments that were cliche when Alien came out. The twists that don't add up to anything at all.

Scott still has a master's eye. That is not in doubt. What is in doubt is Scott's ability it seems to pick terrible stories or terrible writers to tell those stories. This is one such example. Where is the man who created Blade Runner?

The best acting I saw was from lead actress Rapace and even her performance in this film didn't seem like here. She was definitely not on top of her game in this film, nothing like the Millennium Trilogy where I felt like she really hit her stride. There was little to no character development similar to the ""run and gun"" feel of a late Rambo movie. The movie had a very ""scripted feel for me. This film pales in comparison to Scott's older work. Especially the CGI, the part I expected to be the best, seemed beneath him.

I think the ""Scientist Survival Pop Quiz"" really said it all, but one of the things this movie has managed to do is spark alot of discussion & debate. It's still going on, so I thought I'd add my 2 cents...  The stunning visuals within this huge-budget piece will take your breath away. The sets & computer generated scenics/effects are pretty well unmatched in our time. That being said, it seems as if all that cool & beautiful stuff distracted the film makers from everything else. They ignored the fact that the characters were becoming more senseless & unlikeable as the film progressed. as was the script. In fact, it seemed at times as if they were making it up as they went along. For a movie to look so beautiful & have such annoying characters doing idiotic things throughout, is unforgivable...
  I watched the short documentary ""Direct Effect"" to try to gain some understanding of Ridley Scott's creative vision. Unfortunately, I found him to be just as ambiguous & contradictory as the plot of Prometheus. In fact, he seemed like he was a bit drunk...
  The only other good thing I can say about Prometheus is that it has a great trailer.  The film itself is a potential grand work of art... ruined by knuckleheads.",1359676800,5,1275,4.644444444444445

Ridley Scott returns to the Science Fiction genre in a major way with PROMETHEUS, a spiritual prequel to the 1979 classic ALIEN. PROMETHEUS falls very closely in line with the look, feel, and overall mood of the original ALIEN, following a similar structure that includes many familiar characters and settings. Where the two diverge is in their actual storytelling techniques. ALIEN tells a simple yet effective story that comes to a conclusive end after the rising tension found in the first and second acts. The unavoidable plot holes that frequent PROMETHEUS raise more questions than answers every step along the way, leaving the audience to question the writers intentions more so than the grandiose theological discussions that are being proposed. If one thing is for certain, however, it is that Ridley Scott has lost none of his command over this visual medium, creating a mind-blowing display of visual effects that take us well into the next century and beyond the farthest reaches of space. With the suspension of disbelief held high, PROMETHEUS can surely be enjoyed as an epic space adventure in search of far greater meaning amongst the stars.

4772487,5,B005LAIHY0,"Many people hated this movie. Many people also loved this movie.  I had waited and waited to see this movie from the moment I ever first heard about it.  For me personally it didn't disappoint.  It had everything that I had hoped for.  The main thing to understand is that you HAVE to be into this type of science fiction to really enjoy it.  It has horror elements but it isn't really horror.  It also has strong science fiction elements but it isn't your run of the mill sci-fi either.  It is a dark science fiction with a strong lemon spritz of drama added. Science Fiction at it's heart is a brutal analysis of humanity.  This movie has strong hinges on belief, and I feel that is one reason people hate it.

Honestly, the movie was very fun and entertaining with many good elements to take from it.  This DVD/Blu-Ray combo is a fantastic way to go if you are wanting to purchase the movie.  It gives you lots of special features and options for watching the film.

You have to make a choice for yourself whether this movie is something you like or not.  There is too much of a fuss from critics and fans to rely on reading reviews to find out if you want to see it. As for me, I love it.  As a writing major, I feel it has good examples of structure and story arc.  It is a whole and complete movie that is worth watching.

4772561,1,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is a horror film that takes place in a science fiction setting.  The only problem is that it does neither of these things very well.  The setting and themes certainly look sci-fi, but nothing is fleshed out and the audience is left with shallow characters and vague plot concepts that leave more questions than answers.  The horror concept is ruined by a long and drawn out cycle of characters going from their ship, to the underground cave, back to their ship, back to the alien cave.  Throughout this, pointless conversations take place and some characters make very stupid decisions quickly leading to their demise.  The entire bit is sprinkled with alien-like creatures (ala face huggers from the original aliens series) and predators that look like large humans wearing predator masks.  It feels like an array of random scenes stitched together that lack cohesion of any kind and tell a very unsatisfying story of, ""a bunch of people land on a planet and get killed by predator and alien like creatures, but not in any particular new or interesting way.""

All in all, this is a movie you watch to burn time for the sake of burning time and ONLY if you feel like seeing the same old recycled characters and cliches.

 -- (2 TINY SPOILERS) -- Explaining the positioning of the ship on the surface, and how Noomi Rapace's (Dr. Shaw) final speech is so close to Ripley's at the end of Alien are great.

My 2 complaints (SPOILERS):
-- The way they discovered LV-426 felt very ""Indiana Jonesish"" (finding the arifacts on Earth with the same designs, basically a map).
-- The origin of the alien at the end had a ""To Be Continued"" feel - kind of like a 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' cliffhanger season finale.

4772704,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus opens with a breathtaking sequence of scenery and it remains visually stunning throughout, the aliens are not ridiculous, there is a decent amount of blood and gore and the intergalactic settings are believable. Generally the casting is pretty good: Michael Fassbender once again proved how versatile he is, playing a quirky intelligent robot, Charlize Theron is convincing as the cold ambitious commander of the ship and Noomi Rapace generally plays the lead well.

The film unfortunately had a lot of elemental flaws, often seeming to follow a clichd horror film rather than recapturing the originality of the first Alien film. The peripheral characters have stock roles making it clear who will die first and stupid mistakes are made, such as opening the ship's hatch to an infected team member, the captain leaving the tracking board to go and have sex when the machine has picked up the signal for an alien life form, and generally characters having a very lax approach to quarantine procedures. I think the most ridiculous moment occurs at the end of the film when Noomi and Charlize continue to run in the path of a falling space ship instead of just taking a couple of quick steps to the side and easily avoiding it...

Having said all that, the film does fit in quite nicely with the Alien films and it definitely kept my attention throughout: the story was compelling and the 'abortion' scene was suitably disturbing.

4772775,3,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" certainly looks great; its production design echoes ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" without being a slavish copy; it's shot well, and its locations and milieu are convincing.  However, like a pretty girl with no brains, good looks aren't enough to keep you happy for more than a few minutes.  It doesn't start well, with the movie being very confused about a solar system vs. a galaxy vs. planets.  (It doesn't help that later there is discussion of being ""half a billion miles from Earth.""  Um, Pluto is further than that.)  Then you scratch your head more when you discover that this trillion-dollar mission is crewed by an assemblage of idiots and putzes who are briefed on the mission _only after they wake up from hypersleep_.  I'm not buying it.  I'm also not buying how the Engineers can have human DNA when biochemistry and genetics show that all animal life on Earth has common DNA elements, and human is 99% chimpanzee DNA.

Stuff happens, some more convincing than others, and we reach the third act.  The last 45 minutes or so kicks into gear, and makes you suspend your disbelief.  Nooma Rapace channels some Sigourney Weaver in her own way.  I contend that it ends strong.

On the plus side, Michael Fassbender steals the movie with a wonderful, restrained presence that he makes his own; he is not a retread of Ash or Bishop, but his own android personality.

The shame is that there is a really good movie stuck in here, with some great concepts, and with some more work this could have been the best Alien movie since ""Aliens.""

***Spoiler Alert***
Given that Bad Robot controls all movie and TV sci-fi in the US now, my conjecture is that there are two factions of Engineers, one of whom built the humans and one that wants to destroy them, and that they are future humans who returned to the past for some reason - hence the human DNA.  If you watch Fringe - another Bad Robot show - I contend that the Engineers are the Alien universe version of the Observers.",1359072000,,1982,4.622857142857143
4772776,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is a feast for the senses, a grand odyssey and search for beginnings, in the outer reaches of space. Ridley Scott's trademark impeccable taste and ""eye"" for sumptuous design is evident in every frame in this film and reminiscent of the best of science fiction movies, especially those genre re-defining and representative films, the always enthralling 2001: A Space Odyssey and Scott's very own, Bladerunner.

The visual spectacle of Prometheus is impressive though it does not succeed in the way Scott's Bladerunner succeeded at multiple levels, from the spectacular world conjured up before the camera to the deeply human theme of the story. We do see a reprisal of big questions here with a vision to match the scope of those questions. But Scott's resurrection of a lost world in the cosmos has a thin story line with its initially promising theme languishing as the formulaic story overwhelms the film.

Scott has not lost his talent for making his visuals relevant to the ideas that frame this story, its first and last metaphysical/religious questions. The ship perched in orbit on the vast canvas of outer space has that inimitable Ridleyan cinematic quality of conjuring the horror and thrill of seeing a spaceship venturing out to regions where human beings have no business snooping into. We feel the magnificent aloofness and dangers of this mission in those first ten minutes of the film introducing us to the space ship Prometheus and her crew.

Prometheus is a quietly intense reminder of what a director of genius can do with the tools at his disposal. Certain scenes in this film stand as impressively and as nobly crafted as any in science fiction films. The other worldly form of the Gods conceived and depicted here is truly spectacular, even inspired filmmaking. The great scene of a figure in white at the head of a waterfall is Scott's own account of a God giving birth to his world, the ""Genesis"" of the human species. All this is visually intoxicating. This first scene builds up to another visually breathtaking scene in revolving, swirling, shapes in light at the heart of the mother ship, in the middle of the film, with ghostly images of Gods preparing for an expedition to earth to meet human beings face to face. I wish the story of Prometheus were built around these two central scenes to highlight the themes of the creation myth and the prospective reunion of Gods and human beings as the main strands of the plot.

But the encumbrance of a formulaic script rapidly dilutes the effect of this otherwise pioneering and thought provoking film. This great odyssey into space and the initial promise of its grand themes are marred by the script. After an hour into the film, roughly half way, recycled concepts of the mythology of the Alien franchise with familiar scenes and situations make this grand poetic odyssey relatively prosaic. The story of Prometheus rapidly dwindles down to the now familiar horror story of a crew caught unwittingly in a hostile world of predatory aliens. I was hoping that the mythology of this creation of Gods and monsters would have a more expansive premise. If only the film had continued to emphasize the odyssey, this quest to seek out human origins, the mystery and promise of its magnificent opening, this would have been a film for the ages.

Even if Prometheus quickly dilutes the sense of wonder that it initially conjures with its stunning visual conception of an early earthly paradise and its Gods, the sheer spectacle of Scott's vision of Gods and the space they inhabit shines through the weak plot. Scott's visual conception of the God-like species, his account of the genesis of human life is undeniably stirring. He has also succeeded in creating the poetic, even religious, pathos of a grander species succumbing to a more primitive, destructive, logic of predators. Scott resurrects this powerful myth that he had brought to life once before with unforgettable pathos in 2019 Los Angeles in Bladerunner but the voyage out to a forbidden planet in 2093 in Prometheus is an empty myth that starts so promisingly.

Noomi Rapace, as Dr. Shaw, the archeologist, is cast in the same mold as Sigourney Weaver. She is an intense presence on screen, entirely believable, as the intellectually driven, conflicted, and guilt ridden doctor who will be the very personification of the sort of human being that is alternately envied and admired by the mercurial resident android of Weyland Corporations's Prometheus spaceship, David (Michael Fassbender). Charlize Theron was initially considered for the main part but she is convincingly cold and tragic as Vickers, the director of the mission, in league with the powers that be who have financed the ""Prometheus"" enterprise.

Michael Fassbender, as the alternately reliable and resentful android, programmed to look after the crew of Prometheus and its larger mission puts together another brilliantly crafted performance. Fassbender is a force in Hollywood and for good reason; there is nothing this actor cannot do. His performance as an efficient but emotionally erratic android carrying out its duties with a growing sense of resentment for the crew is an effortlessly fluid performance. The performance brings out the chilling elegance of David's persona easily making it the centerpiece and attraction of this film. David is fully conscious of the advantages of not being human. His privileged role in this mission in search for human origins is acknowledged in his beaming face. When the crew is in ""stasis"" in their cryogenic chambers on the way to their destination he meticulously manages the ship with intelligent efficiency.

Promising themes and ideas by themselves are not sufficient to do justice to a film of this imaginative scope. The story has to be built around these themes. It is difficult to stay interested in a cliched, tired, story, after four ""Alien"" films, of seeing a reckless crew bring in the slime, the ooze, the gore, to make themselves hospitable hosts for the hideous life forms that take life within them. But those contemplative moments in scenes of astonishing visual beauty redeems this film, in part. The sheer scale and detail of the digital art in display here is well worth seeing. There are scenes in this film that can be put up in museums to illustrate a sense of beauty that is unsurpassed in cinema .

Prometheus is a flawed masterpiece that I recommend seeing. As a tantalizingly suggestive excursion into the origins of life and death, Gods and monsters, implicit in the Alien franchise, this film is worth a look.  But the world of Prometheus hardly lifts off in this theological sense as its great predecessor Bladerunner did, and only ends up being a magnificent possibility. Prometheus began with a stirring glimpse of a crumbling God and in the end this is an apt metaphor to describe how the beauty and loftiness of this film and its theme are undone and marred by the ordinariness, the predictability, of its story.  One is left with a sense of regret that the vast conception of this film was not allowed to develop at all.  Prometheus is an imposing work of beauty, brilliantly conceiving an enigmatic God. This exquisitely well crafted but marred film stands in my memory, like the God of legend re-imagined in its memorable first scene, a crumbling titan, a God in ruins",1359072000,,7361,4.970755483346872

The extras on the Blu-Ray were fun to watch.

I liked the effects, the action, but while lots of online reviews rip on this movie pretty hard for plot holes and not being logical, I find most of that criticism misplaced.

Then again, it suffers from plot holes and unanswered questions. H.R. Giger ""reverse engineered"" the Xenomorph Alien he designed for Alien. Giger's ghastly, surreal, nightmarish artwork helped create the look of the ""alien"". Species(1995) used a similar creature. In the future, the Weyland Corporation and some scientists travel to an Earth-like moon to meet the creators of man. A deadly secret on the surface could destroy life on Earth! Swedish actress Noomi Rapace is good as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, the film's heroine. Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and Michael Fassbender co-star. The film is visually stunning and epic.

I found this movie to be a hypnotizing cinematic experience. The CGI sucked me right into the movie, and I was only watching the 2d version.
I will admit that I have never watched any of the Alien films that came before Prometheus. I do not see this as a bad thing. Prometheus stands on its own just perfectly, especially since it is a prequel after all. I will also admit it took awhile for me to get sucked into the world that this film creates. The story gets set up superbly around the mid point of the film and the CGI starts to really shine.
With an abundance of bonus features, this 4 disc blu ray package is a steal at $19.99. I would rate this as one of the best single blu ray releases of all time in terms of bonus features. Normally the studios save the gazillions of features for the super duper limited editions. Not for Prometheus.

4772979,5,B005LAIHY0,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that is truly ""not"" from the conjuring ability of the far reaches of a man's imagination.""Alien"" and even the latest ""War of the Worlds"" TC solidly delivered a concept that was totally original and advanced.
 Alien managed to be so extraordinary that it remains the definitive on the subject of extra terrestrials atleast to me- one for believability exceeding even once epic ""Close Encounters...""  albeit surely for inventiveness and definitely originality.

Alien with its deep, isolated, contemplative environs was a film with keen momentum. It was science and space travel, isolated work and resting in suspended states. Even with the emergence of Aliens and Alein 3 certain keys were relatively maintained so as to respect the original movie.

Some 15 years or more down the line from the last relatively cohesive sequal, Prometheus' opening was of critical interest, forcing me to the movie theatres after a decade or more hiatus. I didn't want to miss one special feature or 3D effect. I even saved the movie tickets...

 Well the movie missed the mark -numerous times- with its cliche's and somehow obvious mishaps. Several things annoyed me about this movie and I have listed them here...

1) Mogul and developer Weyland seemed to look like a professional makeup job more so then anything else and he was not entirely convincing in my oppinion-

2) Weyland's daughter in charge was too similar to other Hollywood actresses doing not so similar cryptic roles in recent years. She was also too white-washed. The script was extremely predictable and she seemed more a fashion style study ie decked even with high heels reminiscent of the present then looks of the far future setting.
 I would assume, based on the time of the film, that Weyland's daughter could be genetically enhanced but at the same time she seemed to be too cold and authoritative to convey earthy fear and vulnerability, a stirring effect well used with Sigourney Weaver. I will say at certain times she did try though. In that sense, the film turned its back on the original Alien and the sequels which were often so subtle and sensitive that a definite mood was created and maintained.

3)The emergence of several characters and mechanized voices with a pronounced ""English/British"" accent was over burdening and seemed to be a recent trend concept and surely not based on the movie setting at all which seemed to ignore the dominating all ""American"" working class tone of the original movie and several sequals.

4)Several times the robot droid said phrases that were actually echoes of the first film. Examples are ""impressive"" or ""its organic"" I keep wishing they had left those words off the script or used other descriptives.

5) The connection of the engineers to creating us ""the human race"" even though it was what ""they"" the cave scientists/doctors ""chose"" to believe- was kinda ""off center"" and most definently not what the general consensus would seem to be open or bothered with as thought or concept but that could be arguable. It was annoying for me and a million miles away from welcome images of ""God' or ""Allah"" and also truly not developed in any real clarifying sense. The extra terrestrial being was completely believable however and convincing as an alien life form to me. When the DNA matched us ""humans"" to the alien engineers, I was disappointed as it ruined some important mystique of their character and origin.

6)The ""far out"" engineer/alien could have been maintained at around 10 feet in height for spooky effect vs 7.5 feet range as it appears in key screen shots and angles on film.

7)The fact that the planet was different from the original Alien film is because as I recall in second sequel Aliens, the planet was ""nuked"" or blown up. That seems to be the main forgotten fact of the film that I can understand thus-far although dates and times would play a key part in confirming. So far with that there would be no return to the original planet which could have been more cohesive in a way.

8) Although the alien pyramid design scheme was marginally successful to me, it could have been ""developed"" further in numerous ways even though I think a truly original scheme would be easy to do that could match the same tone of originality as the first Alien film. I think the artist HR Giger could have played a pivotal hand in the design of the pyramids beyond what he had already done albeit with more time.

9) The octopus creature that would emerge from the med pod was marginally successul even though it resembled a robust or large octopus. I don't think too much work was needed on that creature but the ""zenophile"" that would emerge from the impregnated engineer at the end slipped when it opened its mouth. Neither the roar nor the mouth extension was needed to me. By having the creature quiet and examining the darkish surrounding environment would have easily set a more cryptic, haunting tone for the future.

10) The fact that other space craft and engineer pyramids exist on the planet is slightly irritating to me because it reveals too much about what else is on the planet as a whole. By having several pyramids in the same area atleast allows for more space craft without giving away too much information on the rest of the planet and that gives room for a sequel on that subject matter alone. A possible way to capitalize yet on another sequel that is not forced to address the ""end all"" questions of the engineer/extraterrestrial origin or home.

11) When the female doctor at the end said that she wanted to know where they ""the engineers"" came from she seemed relatively shallow, hasty and childlike. Not a bother much but it seemed thrown togethor with no follow up on just how the droid and remaining supplies could offer the opportunity for such long term, precarious exploration away from earth much less other humans and communication.
On another note, I am sure that to find the Alien engineer's home would be and is going to require some of the best Hollywood sci fi designers available first to try to pull it off with success.

12) The alien craft which is probably the most original and ""other worldly"" ever- really needed force and momentum for the final ending scene of its ascension from underground. I am talking sounds or unusual light effects that could have gave it soom needed life. At the end, when the ship began to fall back to the ground it made no substantial noise- in a way there was no strong sense of debris or crashing and breaking which could be permissable but really isn't to me due to its size, the cargo and how the internal materials related in the film. Instead it ends up reminding me of a doughnut of sorts. When the ship ascended it should have had an unusual sound, vibration, light effect and or sense of motor. It instead was lifeless and forgettable despite the superb untypical design of it.

13) When the humanlike robot droid predicted the engineer was headed to earth to ""destroy to create"" it seemed off regardless of the supposed weapons development. In fact the engineer should have never been headed any place necessarily known. What would have been better was if the engineer reacted more hostile, sensitive or inquisitive about the humans entering the flight navigation room. The engineer did in fact react to the humans as if they were cousins or relatively familiar entities and was not fearful or threatened even though the creature seemed on an inner time clock programmed to begin flight or shut down and go into hyper sleep. That part could be believable for even more important reasons but the inclusion of earth as destination should have been omitted because there is no solid exploration of the alien engineers having any lomg term qualm with the earth or humans atleast directly to destroy. Their own problems with contamination or outbreak seem to open room once for further look but closes the need to return to earth in lieu of their original interest in seeding the planet with their DNA or the first communications with human beings to me.

14) In the beginning of the movie the alien who supposedly seeded the earth with its DNA was disappointing. I did acrtually think they were on their home planet not Earth. In this case we are treated to desolation and what appears to be briefly a mormon or sorted religious figure as the space engineer's into. The need to seed the planet is plainly a unconfirmed or more so explored concept and really could have been omitted. The flying saucer in the beginning arguably used did become literally vertical at one point as it ascended back into space but it was unimaginative even seemed worth little as something to pay attention to. One could have seen it as a lunar event or something like an eclispe because detail was truly absent.

Overall I would not bother with this film although its stellar moments are  extraordinary. Scenes with the engineer were never without amazement but trust me one will have to pick and choose key parts to survive the films goof-ups. It seems that the directors and everyone involved should have seized at the chance to really make certain parts shine as bright as others. Attempts should have been made to enhance wherever they could to balance the movie out. Basically its slightly less intricate then the first three Alien films though it makes a good effort from time to time.
What is so annoying is that the concepts introduced here are a bit disruptive and substract from certain other elements.
  In conclusion it would be the Bonus/Extras disc that would have the most informative material on the movie itself and much more. Although it is a 7 hour segment and I only viewed 3 hours as of yet it was worth looking at. Loads of sci fi imagery, imaginative details, models, drawings, computer work, scaled demos, prep work, scripts, alternate endings make up for any movie shortcomings and has been recommended viewing with near A+ ratings from several news publications and critics.
The bonus extras will do many times over what the movie only attempts. Also the screen saver phase before the ""Bonus"" feature begins literally ""blows one away"" with linear, dreamy, super science effects as if at a flight console of a futuristic vehicle getting ready to fly to another distant planet on and on... The screen saver has program data and information on what to expect in the distant planet.

Finally one could not help but get a sense of haste in this movie in relation to the original Alien film which was studied, slow and effectively detailed. What is most promising for the future though of the Alien movies at this point is that the engineers are not yet proven to have created humans which they do not set the tone for necessarily and the female doctor at the end has yet set out on the seemingly impossible problematic course to find the engineer beings home planet. All new subjects to develop on.
3D and digital formats were not discussed directly in this review.

So for now I am returning to hyper sleep

Peace till the next sequel-)

4773043,4,B005LAIHY0,"Love it or hate it, this film has kept people talking ever since it was released last summer. Obviously it's had a polarizing effect and everyone has an opinion, ranging from calling it a masterpiece to calling it one of the worst movies ever made. While I think calling Prometheus a masterpiece is a bit of a stretch, I do think it's a fantastic slice of sci-fi and it reminds me why I love the genre so much in the first place.

Countless others have already talked about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and impressive atmosphere so I won't spend time reiterating those elements here. What really makes this film so engrossing is the questions it raises and, in many cases, leaves lingering long after the credits roll. Now this is precisely what so many filmgoers have been irked about and I certainly do not fault anyone for feeling shortchanged. We all expect different things from our films and I can understand why many left this one feeling disappointed. I won't deny that there are some plot holes and questionable moments; in the end they weren't enough to detract from the film, at least for me. Good sci-fi raises big questions and doesn't always answer them. The first time I saw Prometheus I was mesmerized and instantly began asking friends and family if they had seen it and what their interpretations were. After viewing it again I caught so many details that I had missed the first time around and in the process answered some of my own questions while raising a sizable amount of new ones. It's a joy to return to this film in the attempt to see what I've missed and to soak in the experience time and time again.

This film is meant to be viewed and discussed. It's designed to to keep you on your toes and to spark your imagination, something that most Hollywood films these days won't do. I find it refreshing to have a film that encourages me to think for myself and explore instead of spoon-feeding everything to me. Prometheus isn't perfect and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films. Despite that, I'm simply having fun getting lost in the film and hearing what others have to say. That alone is worth the price of admission.",1358553600,2,2212,4.625954198473282
4773044,5,B005LAIHY0,"First, let me state I'm a huge Sigourney Weaver fan. Aliens SE (1992) was my favorite movie for a substantial portion of my life time. All the aliens sequels were alright movies but not none worthy compared to the uncut Aliens. This movie does not have Sigourney Weaver in it, and yes the actress that plays her pseudo-role is not as good as the original. Regardless this movie is really awesome. Some people really want to hate on this for some reason. I think it is a great day for the canon of aliens. They are coming out with a sequel in 2014 that will diverge onto its own unique story arc. I think this ""reboot"" of Aliens is exactly what the series needed.

Video quality and audio quality of the bluray is just. STUNNING.

4773087,4,B005LAIHY0,"Although Prometheus suffers from a few story elements that don't seem to add up, it perhaps suffered even greater from the anticipation that many felt for the movie prior to its release. That anticipation - couple with the ambiguity of whether or not the movie was a direct prequel - set the movie up for disappointment in the eyes of some.

The storyline in Prometheus is not original. It is a play on the ancient astronaut theory in the context of the Alien universe. In the film, scientists discover a map and view it as an invitation, which launches a trek across the galaxy that ultimately leads to disaster. Such a story needs to rely on acting and atmosphere to be successful, and Prometheus accomplishes just that. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as the lead, while Idris Elba is a scene-stealer and Michael Fassbender deserves as many rewards and praise that can be heaped upon him. His portrayal of the android David is nothing less than astonishing as he walks a fine line between emotionless and calculating. Although Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce feel wasted, Pearce's viral TED talk is a fantastic set-up for Weyland's motivations in accompanying the crew on their journey.

There are certainly unanswered questions. Prometheus was written by one of the producers of Lost, so this should have been expected right away. These are good unanswered question though since you'll find yourself debating them with friends for months after seeing the film. For example, the plot holes and mischaracterizations, on the other hand, stop this film from reaching its full potential. Much has been made of the biologist's ridiculously enthusiastic treatment of the snake creature; however, deleted scenes show an earlier moment when that enthusiasm is directed towards minor worm life forms. Had this scene - which fleshes out the character and his personality - remained in the film, it would have made that scene less ridiculous. Alternatively, the death of Charlize Theron's character due to her inability to run to either side of the tumbling spaceship remains unforgiveable, while the ending sequence with the xenomorph only further confuses whether or not this is a prequel.

Despite these flaws, the film is still highly enjoyable and thought-provoking. It meets the visual expectations of a Ridley Scott Alien movie, and provides a good storyline that allows for intelligent debate.",1358294400,2,2386,5.0971867007672635

4773130,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott made people fall in love with the Alien films (at least the first two). Now,he really engages us with Prometheus. This film has many magnificent aspects that people will love (if they can see them). Prometheus is a really good and genuine film, but it also leaves the audience guessing too much.

This movie is classified as science fiction for a reason. The plot is highly interesting and highly unpredictable. It keeps the audience wanting more. The synopsis is truly amazing. Everything that takes place in the film can be related back to one core concept. As long as viewers remember that, the film should be really intriguing. Also, this is the best aspect of the film. At the same time, it is the most disappointing. The questions that viewers watched throughout the movie barely got answered. They were really replaced by new ones. It keeps you always wanting more, even after the film. This is one of the main reasons why some viewers do not like this film. Honestly, it appears to be Scott's intention to leave the audience wanting more and it fits with one of the themes in the film. But I truly must say to clear any misunderstanding that this film is NOT an Alien film. This is not suppose to relate directly back to the Alien franchise, but it does leave bread crumbs that help viewers understand it's origins.

Next, the visuals were amazing. When watching this film in HD, you will love the vividness on the screen. Unlike other sci-fi films, this film did not use heavy emphasis on computer graphics while sacrificing a strong plot. The graphics are stunning and all other aspects of the film are still great. They are realistic and not cheap looking.

Finally, the actors are really good. The cast consist of Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and other actors/ actresses.

In general, this film is fantastic for those who want to see something new and different. Most current sci-fi films have weak plots and heavy use of CGI. This film is the opposite. This movie is a true changer for science fiction films with a plot that throws many questions, but leaves the audience waiting (and some frustrated by the wait).",1358208000,,2162,4.742021276595745

What I did like were the sets (what I could see of them in all that darkness), the added attraction of the Engineers, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and a totally unrecognizable Guy Pearce.
The story was fairly basic for a sci-fi adventure: you board a vessel, get to where you are going, mayhem ensues, death everywhere, end of story.  Evil being without and within the group was also to be expected and was handled in a perfunctory fashion.  Personalities within the crew weren't allowed to develop because heaven forbid you give your body count some character traits.

This is about as bad a prequel as Phantom Menace - if anything it may be worse.

Overall, it appears to be bad for roughly the same reasons.

First, like the Star Wars prequels, the director seems to have started with a bunch of scenes they wanted to do for special effects reasons, then attempted to stitch them together after the fact.  Like Star Wars, the overall concept of what the movie is about and specific scenes either fail to connect or conflict.

The characters are illogical and make mistakes, yes, but on a more basic level, they don't make sense as people.  Characters are driven by emotion not logic, so we can't fault them for making the occasional mistake, but the characters act with no motivation or in a way that invalidates previously-established motivation or basic aspects of their character.  As a result, I don't like, relate to, care about any of these characters.  I'm a little bit intrigued by the android until he too turns out to be nonsensical.  By making the actions of people incoherent, contradictory, stupid, and inconsistent, they're made into non-characters.  They aren't believable as people.

I'd say there isn't much of a plot, an actual narrative per se.  There is no discernable character arc for any of the characters.  You could describe what happens on their mission in a sentence or two.

The film is awfully derivative - there seems to be a lot of borrowing from different places.  Maybe Leviathan.  And Stargate.  Most of this film stole scenes or concepts directly from Alien vs Predator, Alien, and Aliens.  However, the award goes to Star Trek Next Generation season 6 episode 20 The Chase, in which an ancient humanoid race referred to as The Founders is sought by scientists due to the result of archaeological research and found to have seeded their own DNA billions of years ago on other planets, giving rise to other humanoid races including of course humans.  They're kind of albino-ish looking with strong brow ridges and bald heads.

So overall, I'd say if you watch something like Forbidden Planet or Planet of the Vampires, you'll be more satisfied.  Maybe even more satisfied with The Green Slime

...end of the overview.  But I can't resist going into a few more specific diatribes...

========================

Some specific examples of bad filmaking

LAZY characterization.  The lead female scientist has ""faith.""  Not in Christianity per se but just a generally faith-y disney-its-maaagic kinda person.  How do we know?  Other characters tell her she's a ""believer"" several times and she wears a cross.  Yet she's following a line of thinking that directly contradicts the cross she wears.  Maybe she'd have been more believable if she was referred to as a ""dreamer"" and ""mystic.""  ...show her hanging a dreamcatcher over her bed, reading Crowley and Chariots of the Gods, have her talk about a few other off-the-wall ideas to establish a general hunger for strangeness and hidden mystery.  As it was, she was a person with two diametrically opposed beliefs and no inner tension.  Worse, she's a scientist and a Christian but believes - without specific evidence - that the figures in various ancient illustrations created humanity so she strays from BOTH her main character traits - her faith and her science.  A person who doesn't even value their own values is difficult to like as a protagonist.

LAZY science fiction - they reference ""ancient civilizations"" all having the same star map and include Cave Men, the Mayans, and the Babylonians.  So you've got cave painters from 40,000BC, Babylonians from 1700BC, and Mayans from 250-900 AD cited as all ancient and all having the same star map.  What, they didn't want to drop off the same map for Atilla, Constantine, Diocletian or Charlemagne?  With the other civilizations cited, it implies Engineers being constantly on earth interacting with humans for essentially all of human history.  So they were around for 41,000 years, THEN decided they felt like getting rid of us, then at that convenient moment - but not anytime in the 40,000 years before - destroyed themselves with their own weapons just at the perfect moment - and apparently the Engineers at this one facility were the only ones to know this needed to be done.

If we are to believe the Engineer in the first shot was on a very early earth, we should remember life started maybe 3.5 BILLION years ago which is a long wait to decide you made a bad go of it.  But let's assume they only intended to modify existing life.  You'd probably need to arrive close to the development of invertabrates to at least have some chance of influencing local evolution to lead to an Engineer-like creature so they could have shown up for the Cambrian explosion which still gives them about 580 MILLION years to mull over the fate of all life on Earth.

Of course, to think that various influences that cause mutation leading to evolution - such as cosmic radiation hitting the earth for 580 million years straight - not to mention evolutionary pressures ie a different environment/planet - could possibly allow for CONVERGENT evolution leading to a specific body plan reveals a deep, deep non-understanding of science in general and in multiple disciplines.  Like, this was what they wanted the movie to be ABOUT but they couldn't be bothered to crack a single book on the subject?  Does the story of Prometheus take place in a heliocentric universe by chance?  Or is the Earth flat?  Are humans assumed to be composed of 4 substances/humors?

LAZY writing and choice of scenes.  A surprising amount of time in Prometheus is spent setting up the same scenario as a single scene in Aliens - the same plot with the same exact plan - the evil Corporation plans to expose a human being to alien contagion, then transport them back to Earth in suspended animation.  In Aliens, it was a quick, suspenseful scene and it made sense - the corporate guy did it because he was seeking profit at everyone else's expense.  In Prometheus, it doesn't make any sense.  The android has no personal motivation to do it and the guy who owns and controls the corporation is THERE onboard for a completely different purpose than profit - in fact, introducing an uncontrolled unknown never before studied contagion on board could greatly threaten his project and of course his life.  Why do they do it then?  Not for any goal but because er... it's what happened in another Alien movie so... it happens because that's what happens in these movies?  Like, Ridley Scott wanted to make a non-Aliens prequel that was big-concept and thoughtful and did new things... therefore decided he needed to RE-DO the same thing covered by Cameron in the first alien sequel??? WTF?  Lazy, lazy writing to rehash a previously - and well - explored idea.  Characters that work against their own purposes.  If they KNEW a monster would result from the trick, having it inside the ship would kill the crew and perhaps the billionaire and thus ruin his mission and end his life when he came there to extend his life - or if they had no idea what it would do, it hardly made sense to set it loose outside of a lab environment, considering how paranoid they were about living in a lifeboat.

Most of the movie is taken up with people doing things that make no sense and things that make no sense happening.  Even making no sense in terms of the plot or story or just the basic idea for the film - such as why rehash previously explored Alien movie subplots? - the movie is about the big picture, alien ""gods"" as opposed to alien monsters... but the Engineer we meet is essentially indistinguishable from the no longer sentient crazed spider-monkey former crew member that goes berzerk.

Or having the automated medical system software not have any directions loaded for females - wouldn't it come standard?  Wouldn't the old millionaire want it to be capable of helping his daughter who he was dependent on while he was in coldsleep?  Moreover, shouldn't it be unable to operate at all under those conditions?  These are all considerations that reveal the movie as stupid... But consider it from the writer's perspective from outside the story - they planned to have this character do the decathalon within 24 hours of a cesarean section.  Sprinting, jumping, getting smashed by an alien and thrown across the room, jumping and landing heavily on things, climbing, more sprinting, more climbing... assuming the writers decided the same character MUST go through both the operation and feats of athleticism instead of using two different characters or giving her time to heal, do you really want to go out of your way to have the medical system state it is not equipped to take care of women?  Maybe you could argue that futuristic technology makes it all possible but not when you have that technology itself tell the audience it isn't set up to help.  Dumb nonsensical writing.

Alien was about a bunch of space-truckers who get re-routed from their normal job by their employer unexpectedly and run into something they can't handle.  They're essentially expendables for a corporation who thinks first of profit and last of their safety.  Despite the fact that they aren't scientists, they still worry about basic safety things like quarantine.  Conversely, the owner of the corporation himself takes his A team out on a mission with him for the purpose of saving himself from death and they appear to be universally foolish, incompetent, and generally not A personality types.  They don't seem to have much concern for each other or even their own lives let alone their jobs.  You'd want a cast of sophisticated scientists and professionals for Prometheus to replace the hapless space-truckers of Alien because you want characters capable of the kind of nuanced, depthful discussions and actions needed to address the ""big questions"" of the film.  Instead you have a badly written teenage slasher film with some of the best special effects ever.  I recommend Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer over Prometheus.

...a small example of character development/character arc in Prometheus:

Shaw:

(dreamily, flakily) ""I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators, and I want to meet them.  I believe that because... I believe it""

(aghast, horrified) ""we should have never come here. we were so, SO WRONG!!!!""

(dreamily, flakily) ""I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators. I want to meet them... so I can ask them why""

---

(terrified, urgently) ""If you don't stop that ship, there won't be any home to go back to!!!""

(dreamily, flakily) ""I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators, and I want to meet them. I'll just show up so they know we weren't wiped out yet and present myself for interrogation - assuming they don't kill me on sight - with an andriod that has a head full of information about Earth and one of their ships with a flight path they'll be able to follow back to this planet, where they'll find the remains of our own ship and our intact lifeboat, both full of information - the navigation databases certainly showing the location of Earth along with, most likely, every major human settlement. ...so I can ask them why.""",1358121600,11,11841,5.011764705882353

4773239,1,B005LAIHY0,"Thankful that I rented this rather than actually spending money to own it. Im guessing the special effects would be awesome in 3-d . The characters are underdeveloped , hard to relate to and difficult to follow. The plot  alone is good . The product as a whole is not.  None of the characters form a personality .  Where there could be interesting character developments they chose to back track and go directly the opposite of what they have laid out . Example ; the main Dr  is not religious and has dialog with the other Dr yet he has a cross tattoo . Not one character is believable . The robot is supposed to be ""nonliving "" with out feelings yet he comes across human ,maybe even evil . Ms Vickers (Charlese Theron ) character takes on the persona of a jello mold . No true emotion . For the most part several random events are thrown together haphazardly . The most insulting part was the impromptu Caesarian section .( I have had three of those procedures) First a 15lb squid pops out of a flat sunken in stomach . They could have shown it getting larger ,all I saw was her screaming and a lump that moved a crossed her stomach . Secondly you cant walk after your guts are ripped out and stapled back together ,no less run and fight off aliens .  Giving birth naturally one tentacle at a time would be more believable . (Speaking from experience the pain of childbirth does not end with contractions nor is it not present because you had a Caesarian. Then at the very end (I guess this is the tie in to Alien ) made no sense . The opening scene made no sense and tied into to nothing . Big alien dude eats his lunch and falls apart into a river ? The cave paintings cracked me up because it looked like a guy skeet shooting .  Dont waste your time or money . Im a huge Sci-fi fan . Watch something else . Oh and if I remember correctly Alien the movie does not take place in the future yet the alien is born in the future.  I don't know maybe they were planning on the movie theater to be filled with people who were wasted and just happy with the 3d and could care less about having a plot or characters ? oh I gave it a 1 because they make you so count this as a minus 5 .",1357948800,6,2182,4.12

It's actually a great cinematic experience to begin with and the story, though I must admit does have some gaps, it doesn't really affect the movie as it is.

As far as the DVD itself, I've waited a few months hoping to see if there was going to be a special edition of the movie release because I love to see how the movie is made and the stories behind the scenes of the movie.  It did say that it has special features but it was just alternate and deleted scenes, which is nice but not that special.  THIS is the only reason I rated the purchase to a 3 star.  I really do wish the descriptions given to DVDs on amazon really start becoming specific to the purchase because giving general description of the movie is nice and all but the specs make a big difference to the full experience of the purchase.  Knowing what you're buying is crucial to make the buyer happy.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for just a great cinematic experience this is a 5 star, for a great story this is a 4 star, if you are an ber alien franchise fan it's a 3.5, and the DVD (just read the title).",1357948800,,1216,4.1931330472103

4773386,1,B005LAIHY0,"It's difficult to understand how such an ill-conceived film got funded. One can only assume the producers figured fans of the frist two ""Alien"" films would line up for a prequel that answered the questions those films raised. Had I been the reader, I would have sent back the script with ""Try again -- a lot harder!"" scribbled on the cover.

I expected a film with profound insights into Life, the Universe, and Everything. What I got was a story that, for the first 90 minutes, rehashed ""Alien"". The voyagers do all the stupid things the people in the first film do, with minor variations. When we finally start getting answers to our questions, they turn out not to be particularly surprising or deep. And at least one major issue isn't properly addressed or resolved.

The following is from the Wikipedia article: ""According to Scott, although the film shares 'strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak', and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas."" Most viewers are likely to strongly disagree -- especially as the first film had no particular mythology, or any ""idea"" other than to scare the crap out of the audience (which it did very well).

The script is mechanical, sloppy, and thin, especially in the dialog department. Unlike the first two films, which focus tightly on the characters and their predicament, ""Prometheus"" has unnecessary scenes and slack, pointless dialog. I was particularly annoyed by the scenes in which Janek asks Vickers if she's interested in hanky-panky, and Vickers stating that Weyland is her father (when their //actions// up to that point make that clear).

Ridley Scott's direction is no more than competent. Though the general lack of tension might be partly due to our familiarity with the material, it's hard to believe ""Prometheus"" was directed by the man who helmed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". The only sequence that doesn't come across as wholly mechanical is Shaw's using a computer-controlled surgery machine to perform a Caesarian. But it's so over the top that it's hard to believe, as is Shaw's ability to be up and around right after.

I, however, can not say that the direction is good, because a good director would have changed E V E R Y T H I N G.  Yes, even Ridley Scott can make stinkers (and this one isn't his first).

4773441,4,B005LAIHY0,"Like many reviews on here, I was very excited to view Prometheus when it came out.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time, and thus had to wait until it came out on DVD.  In the meantime I had read the reviews, and my enthusiasm for the movie waned a bit.  Though, after watching Prometheus recently, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, and a bit disappointed with parts as well.

  The movie is beautiful to watch.  From the opening scenes of the Engineer by the waterfall, to the scenes on LV-223 within both the Prometheus and the Engineer's spaceship.  There were scenes tying into the Aliens Universe if you looked hard enough, and enough new territory to make this something new in that Universe.

  I thought the acting for the most part was very well done.  Michael Fassbender as David, the cyborg, was excellent, especially his scenes with Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace).  Both those ladies did a fantastic job, as did Idris Elba as the Prometheus's Captain.  Logan Marshall-Green's performance as Dr. Holloway was a bit stiff, however Guy Pearce had a complete old-man makeover as Peter Weyland, the CEO of Weyland Corp.  It took me 5 minutes of viewing before I realized that it was even Guy Pearce.  I should have listened more to the voice.

  Definitely some of the more frustrating things of the movie was the way the crew reacted when they encounter the Engineer ship,and some of the scenes within.  As others have recounted:  the taking off of the helmets, the two crew getting ""lost"" within the spaceship, not being ultra-careful with many ominous canisters lined up in the ""Head"" room, ect...

The Extra's featured on the Blu-Ray & Digital Copy:

*  Deleted & Alternate Scenes - A couple were interesting, and a couple were not.  Not many for a long film.  I did like the scene where at the beginning where they decided to do 1 Engineer rather than many.
*  Peter Weyland Files -  4 short files on Weyland's computer.  1 is of a speech made by Weyland in 2023, however I liked the one of an Infomercial for David the Cyborg.
*  Prometheus Mobile App so you can interact with your smartphone or tablet when the movie is on.
*  Commentary by writer Jon Spaihts and writer/ex producer Damon Lindelof.
*  Commentary by director/producer Ridley Scott.

I did really enjoy this movie, even with some of the more frustrating behaviors of the crew, and many questions being unanswered.  I have heard this is part 1 of a trilogy, so hopefully our questions will be answered in the future.",1357689600,5,2538,4.680272108843537

4773608,3,B005LAIHY0,"The characters lack of common sense hinders the audiences ability to enjoy the story, and as the audience experiences a story (intellectually and emotionally) on the backs of its characters (by recognizing pretty and/or ugly human behavior), poor characterization and unbelievable motivation leaves the audience with few ways to enter this story.

Characters without the basics of self-preservation make no sense to an audience (who after all are animals living in a hostile world).  Even the smallest fish (with the tiniest brain) will try to avoid a net, thus demonstrating a recognition of danger and a desire to continue living.  Most characters in Prometheus showed no such basic commitment to their own lives [SPOILER ALERT] (ex: upon reaching destination in the cave, almost immediately removing life sustaining and life protecting helmets on an alien, unknown, unexplored planet; trying to pet a hostile snake-like alien; and the list goes on).  Almost across the board the characters make poor choices inconsistent with life (which makes no sense to the audience as the story is not presented as a suicide mission), so no surprise by the story's end, most of the characters are dead.

The problem is that in a similar situation, most of the audience would not have made the same choices.  I think a 5 year old would not have removed her/his helmet - the fact that the scientists, doctors and experts do so push the audience right out of the story and into critical analysis (and a critical audience is a hostile audience); dido for trying to pet the alien snake.  I think even an infant would have avoided the hissing alien snake (though they'd probably watch it from the safety of their parent's arms if they were a comfortable distance away), and I'm positive 99.999% of toddlers would have avoided same.  So when an adult male with specialized training - who wants to leave an area after he comes into contact with a dead alien, but is so entranced by a live one that he forgets all rules of self preservation, is promptly killed, the audience rolls their eyes.

And it doesn't matter that this behavior comes from a secondary character.  Poorly constructed secondary characters (non-leads whose behavior makes no sense given the story premise and their job title in the story) ruin good films all the time - so much time and effort is put into making the primary characters appealing, that secondary characters' character development is often ignored.  Yet secondary characters provide the frame into which primary characters are placed; secondary characters provide the ""world."" If the story's world makes no sense to the audience, it doesn't matter how attractive the leads are, the story won't fly.  A story is only as strong as its weakest link and cannot reach its full potential with poorly constructed secondary characters.

George Lucas comes to mind as showing a solid working knowledge of this fact as he demonstrates successfully in Star Wars: the jawas are believable as alien tinkers, the Skywalkers are believable as isolated farmers, the sandpeople are believable as opportunistic predators - these secondary characters' behavior and work are recognizable to the audience and so make sense and serve to strengthen the story, therefore making the story believable.  [A story is a proof, after all.]  In my opinion, the clear sign of a subpar script is poor secondary character development; in an expensive special effects movie like Prometheus, it's like putting a high end paint job on an inexpensive car.

The audience for Prometheus would have accepted as reasonable the two lost scientists (who needed to have gotten lost by somehow losing their equipment, or some other logical reason, as no reason is provided in the film [a mistake on the filmmakers part]), spotting the snake-alien, fleeing, and being killed subsequently, if perhaps the snake-alien exhibited an unusual skill set prior to attacking (for example, being able to hover over the scientists, defying gravity, or any type of unusual hunting technique not previously seen, and done so fast the scientists have no time to effectively counter).  The audience could buy that and would have remained in the story, but it is impossible for most people in the audience to believe that anyone would wish to pet a never-before-seen, hissing, snake-alien.  Especially considering that these same characters recently fled when they saw a dead alien.

The job of filmmakers is to create a story that makes sense to the audience - the audiences' reality is the ruling reality.  If the filmmakers' story makes no sense to the audience, the story fails.  Prometheus fails because the filmmakers do not understand that the audience judges the protagonists (good team) characters' reactions to the story's hostile environment and antagonist (villans) characters, as well as against the audiences' reaction to said antagonists and hostile environment.  Somewhat of a mental game the audience plays, audience intellectual/emotional investment in a film stems from an comparison/competition on the audience's part between the audience and protagonists, with the antagonists/hostile environmental as a backdrop, forming a triangle.  The audience puts themselves in the story, subconsciously, and reacts to the story's threats.  We react to threats as the animals we are - physical safety first, for ourselves, our loved ones, our team, our group.  In a way, the protagonists physically stand in for the audience (in the audience's psychology), and when the protagonists' reaction doesn't match our own when we assess the specific threat being presented in the story, and the protagonists or someone on their team comes to harm because of what the audience perceives as the protagonists' inappropriate reaction, the audience blames the protagonist, and subconsciously, on an emotional level, exits the story.

For instance, had the scientists initially fled from the snake-alien and subsequently been killed by an unexpected, unusual attack - unusual as judged by the audience - the audience would have accepted the scientists death uncritically; but fleeing first was necessary because the audience's first instinct was to flee.  But the lost scientists were killed after one tried to pet a hissing alien-snake, something the audience would not do, so the audience judged the characters as nonsensical, blamed the scientists for their own deaths, and emotionally and intellectually left the story.  Prometheus takes a logic hit and does not recover.  Two hundred million dollars spent for a fail because the filmmakers do not understand how an audience engages with a story.

Comparison and assessment are at the heart of audience intellectual/emotional participation in a film.  As the audience, I guess the challenging process of filmmaking, i.e., obtaining funding, attaching stars, scheduling, is so overwhelming to filmmakers that the audience's needs are often ignored, and yet studios seem surprised when expensive films fail.  But the audience never wants a story to fail.  The audience wants entertainment, pleasure, seeing a representation of itself on the big screen.  The audience doesn't enjoy seeing poorly constructed films - we pay twice after all, earning the money to view the film (and we all know earning money takes time); we pay again by giving time to view the film.  Time is the ultimate gift because we have a limited amount of it.  Therefore it is clear the audience, willing to pay so dearly for a commodity, desires that commodity.

In Prometheus, the filmmakers had the writers kill off secondary characters in such sub-common-sense ways that the audience could not enjoy the story.  Characters in inexpensive slasher movies fall like flies, but the audience knows it's a horror movie and accepts the convention.  More was expected from Prometheus, prequel to the really good Alien franchise, but clearly the filmmakers ran out of ideas; no crime just disappointing.  The acting, cinematography, set design, visuals, and other technical work on the film was fine (though shots seemed to be missing). I am curious to see how the survivors fare in Prometheus II, so I'll check out the movie from the library when it is released next year.

Grade: disappointing story and character development as audience comes to film with high expectations, but overall, watchable due mainly to solid acting, cinematography, and other visuals.",1357430400,8,8431,5.210954848260548

I got the 4 disc set at Best Buy at the same price as Amazon here, but posting this to help some 3D Blu Ray users from suffering what many others have suffered from some weirdness about how the discs are made. Check this thread before you buy. [...]
---
Please count me in with those frustrated by the weirdness that is most definitely attributable to Prometheus.

I have a Sharp AQUOS 80"" 3D Quattron TV with their media player blu ray player. I have not had any disc not play. A few weeks ago I took Prometheus 2D Blu Ray from the library, and try as I would, it did not play. All other Blu Rays played fine. I took it back.

I rarely buy movies on disc as they only get used once as far as I am concerned. But, before Christmas I bought from Best Buy the 4-disc set. I finally opened it tonight.

I checked for updates and my SHARP player is fully updated. But, the  fact that this movie from a sealed new package did not play from my new 3D disc... BOTH discs actually hang the Blu Ray player and the only way to shut it down is to hold the Power button until RESET appears.... as well as the thread linked above show that the problem is widespread. Maybe that is why they are selling a 4-disc set for $19.99.

I will now have to dig the receipt to return the movie if they will even take it after so many days.

Very disappointed and annoyed at the makers of this set of discs.

4773615,5,B005LAIHY0,"I chose to give it 5 stars for a few reasons. One is that I mainly wanted to see the deleted scenes to get a better idea of the movie of what they were trying to accomplish and how the movie would be different with alternate scenes/ending/beginning. Another is the superb quality and sound! Absolutely brilliant on a nice 5.1 surround sound system (a must!).

What I learned from looking at the deleted scenes is that the movie was heavily cut down in length and content. That is most likely why it confused so many viewers overall and it's typical hollywood ""no more than 2 hrs"" movie since the average humans attention span is so short, they just cut down all movies to be short and to the point. I think they could have done a much better job overall especially with the dumb crew members which is the main thing that I wished they did different in this movie. After watching the entire movie in blue ray after watching the commentary/deleted scenes, it did alter my view on the engineers. At first I thought they were just the evil creators of humans but after they seen how we try to play gods in making our own creations, it was no wonder they turned on us to destroy us. They were highly disappointed in us.

4773650,4,B005LAIHY0,"I am a huge fan of the first 3 Alien films (yes, even the third one), and I was among those who looked forward to Prometheus, whether it was a prequel or not. I have now seen this film 4 times: first in the theater, then 3 times at home on Blu-ray. It took watching it with the director's commentary and again with the screenwriters' commentaries to appreciate the great scope of vision these guys had when making this film. Watching it the fourth time was the fulfilling experience I had hoped for in the first place.  So, shouldn't a film stand on its own?  Should a great film be ""great"" with only a single viewing?

I am old enough to have seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in a first run engagement, and I can tell you that very few left the theater ""getting it."" While it generated a lot of discussion, not many claimed to have loved it. I believe if we had a review system like Amazon, the film would have earned marks similar to what Prometheus is getting. I still find it difficult to sit through, but most today consider 2001 A Space Odyssey to be a classic.

Nobody will put Prometheus in the same conversation as 2001, except to compare the character David with HAL.  Unfortunate, because Prometheus is technically as well crafted and thematically as challenging. It is possible that its detractors will view Prometheus in a few years and see it in a much more favorable light.

Why didn't Prometheus satisfy me the way Alien did upon seeing it the first time? I admit to disappointment at the derivative plot elements in Prometheus.  Alien was so original, with surprises coming every 5 minutes. On the other hand, Alien was a science fiction horror movie--no big questions asked or answered. Prometheus, like 2001, asks the greatest question of all--how did it all begin? Prometheus does work as a prequel, in that we do learn how the alien creatures originated. To succeed as a prequel, there had to be references taking us back to Alien, though some of these were a little ham-fisted.

I am left feeling much like I did at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, another film that good as it is, sets the viewer up for a sequel. I am hoping Ridley Scott finds the money to fund another film, one that doesn't need the alien creature at all to move forward the journey of Dr Shaw and David to find the origin of life. I am like Shaw--I will continue to believe what I believe no matter what Scott comes up with--but I think I will enjoy the discussion.",1357344000,8,2455,4.452115812917595

4773656,4,B005LAIHY0,"In 2089, the Weyland corporation sponsors archaeologists, including Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who discover celestial maps on ancient walls in Scottish caves that match those in other ancient ruins around the world. Following these maps, an advanced spaceship called ""Prometheus"" travels across galaxies in a four-year span to reach a distant moon that matches the ancient maps. Among the crew of this ship is an all-purpose android named David (Michael Fassbender) whose intellect is nearly perfect and has immense capabilities and perhaps a growing sense of self. There is also a sage but salty captain, Janek (Idris Alba), a naively friendly biologist (Rafe Spall), a grumpy geologist (Sean Harris) and a corporate micro-manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). The exact mission of Prometheus is unknown as the initial thesis behind these suspected maps, that they were extraterrestrials who visited Earth thousands of years ago, may be the starting point of surprising and horrifying truths. To make things even more mysterious, we occasionally see hologram messages of the late, enigmatic Mr. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself. What exactly is on the mysterious moon and why did the Weyland Corporation spend trillions on this voyage? Where will the search for the truth lead them?

Prometheus is a semi-prequel and sidequel to its director's, Ridley Scott, 1979 film Alien. The film is very well-paced and it hooked me from the start. Scott still has his directing magic and the editing and cinematography are top-notch. Despite the alien moon being a gloomy and creepy place, the gray, purple and desert landscapes and skys are gorgeous. Like the original film Alien, the special effects, set pieces, costumes and props are imaginative and an interesting blend of modernism and futurism. Fear not, the unique, influencing styles of H.R. Giger are still to be found throughout the film. While the film was excellent in many technical ways, I was very disappointed by much of the story and some of the acting.

Prometheus is a film Scott has tried to create for years and production began in 2009. Jon Spaihts developed an outline and rough draft of the script. Spaihts leaked script shows a much more explained and nuanced story as well as character development then the final product. Co-writer Damon Lindelof might be the reason behind the perplexing elements of the film. For instance, the protagonist Elizabeth Shaw was a well written, interesting character who was smart, strong and curious but she orders the crew to do something monumentally stupid shortly after Prometheus lands on the moon. In fact, there are a lot of horror film cliches where people (educated professional people, in this case) do things so ridiculously dumb even a sea sponge would know not to do. This is just poor writing.

Still, this was a very good film with some memorable highlights. An unforgettable sequence unfolds at about seventy-three minutes into the film involving striking holograms; it is something like a gorgeously alien planetarium. I also enjoyed the authentic usage of Proto-Indo-European in the film; a nice touch by Scott and the other filmmakers in getting the details right rather than using gibberish or linguistic unobtainium. Michael Fassbender is given a very interesting role as an android who looks just like a man and mimics the feelings and expressions of people perfectly. Like a replicant, he has a fascinating emotional state as his mimicry might at some point in the journey have developed into an actual ego. Fassbender's performance is impeccable here. Rapace, Pearce, Alba and Theron all do well in their roles but the clear weak link is Logan Marshall-Green. His performance is closer to a drunken fratboy whose matriculation was due to his father being the dean than an actual archeaologist. Denise Richards was far more convincing as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones in The World Is Not Enough than Marshall-Green was here. That is saying a lot. For those who enjoyed the horror of the Aliens series, there are some very intense and squeamish scenes. Those who are a bit sensitive to body horror and gore might want to close their eyes during some scenes in Prometheus.

I do not see the problem with the open-ended and unanswered questions in Prometheus. The film was designed to be the first in a trilogy, and great science fiction and pensive fictions require such questions to ask of its audience. The overall experience of Prometheus is dreamy, nearly surreal, with the great mysteries touched upon but only superficially addressed. This film fall far short of the truly great and cerebral, philosophical science fiction films such as Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Oydessy and Metropolis. Prometheus was entertaining and, at times, horrifying and scary. I appreciate the fact that Prometheus provided some amazing sights and entertaining mysteries, and it loosely had some heavy themes but it could have been a lot better without the plotholes. The sights and sounds of the film wowed me, but the story's flaws are unfortunately present.",1357257600,,5128,5.174698795180723

4773821,3,B005LAIHY0,"A big let down. This Ridley Scott film displays story-telling ineptitude hidden by clever special effects. The film doesn't engage the solar-plexus,the characters are not developed,the pacing is wrong. In Alien we get to know the 7 characters well. Here,big ideas are let down by not being grounded or believable. The only space we inhabit is cerebral. It has a detached,clinical feel;the dialogue full of pseudo-scientific conceptions that feel unreal. Even `want' is seen as a concept by David(Fassbinder)the android. Fassbinder steals the movie as the gentle robot who models himself on O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia and oversees the sleeping astronauts' dreams,does tests/examinations on them. Its all in the script. Ridley Scott has picked up a story which he made 30 years ago and tried to re-imagine it and failed to the highest order in his attempts. This was a movie made specifically to be part of a larger framework - at least a sequel and probably a trilogy. The meaning of life, immortality, the punishment by the gods, the source of humanity, evolution vs creation, religion,the scope was too big for the story,too cluttered for alien life to fit into a context. No awe,wonder,panic or dread as in Alien. Shucks!

Star Wars did prequels inferior to the 1st trilogy. Scott has seen Alien sequels and wanted to cut them away and do a reboot return to origins,as the original director. Scott takes the Space Jockey-the dead giant humanoid pilot with burst chest found in the crashed spaceship along with the alien eggs-and ask where he came from. Prometheus shows an Earth expedition that happens on the site before Alien. There is no paranoia or claustrophobia in this version. The people who created us want us wiped out. This is like old concepts of disaster being visited on Earthlings for original sins. Beset here by ancient alien genetic engineering of humanity a la 2001 and Von Daniken. The director takes precedence over the writer Lindelof. Alien was hard-pressed,uplit,down-beat,post-industrial,a simple shocker about people we wondered would live through the next 5 minutes. That universe had been deeply thought-about, contained mysteries,had a sense of knowing more than it told,showed didn't tell. Prometheus is a complex movie asking big questions about the nature of the universe. Alien's modesty made it awesome,revealing mysteries and horrors embedded in its fabric(Of that which we cannot speak we must remain silent).

I liked Noomi Rapace's Dr Elizabeth Shaw,she reprises some of Ripley's quick,fiery ferocity and anguish. Prometheus struggles to reconcile its origins-of-life quest with the need to deliver regular gloopy shocks. Here all surprise has been evicerated, most characters made expendable. There is a plot-twist reveal that is a non-event. The mission is to ""overturn 3 centuries of darwinism"".Like yeh. Ideas are add-ons not component parts. The later Alien's graphics look earlier than Prometheus's CGI fx(as they are,its just the director that used CGI as the Emperor's New Clothes to hide the shallowness of creationism run wild).From such a cast,so little. From such a director we expected so much.",1357084800,,3149,5.270916334661354

4773868,2,B005LAIHY0,"As a fan of all of the ""Alien"" franchise, I am probably a bit generous with my review. I enjoy most of the films that R. Scott makes as well.

BUT

The weakness here is glaring. The plot does not make much sense, especially in the context of the trilogy. The movie begins as a tense thriller, but quickly devolves into something else entirely. There is a heavy dose of moralistic pontificating (which never works in movies like this). Scott was successful when he did this in Blackhawk Down, but it does not fit here. The characters are barely likeable and they share no chemistry. And after all of those issues, it is the plot that kills the show.

The only good about this movie comes from the great visuals and sound. I did manage to watch it all the way through and only yawned twice and stepped out for a refrigerator break once.

However, the script is a bit uneven and illogical at times.  I can't help but think how great the conflict would have been, if the crew found the Engineer 40 minutes sooner and had to deal with the big lug, instead of having many members of the crew killed by their own stupidity.  When the Engineer awakes to the sight of the ""out of place humans"" in the nest of his bio-warfare/development facility, it should be pretty clear why he reacts the way he does.

The numerous howlers and structural gaffes have been well documented in other reviews, I won't make you suffer through them again. The most human character is David, the android (Fassbender is terrific). Almost every other character is embarrassing and ill-conceived (don't blame the actors).

Of course we can accept honorable failures in art. It happens. What I wonder is how this lousy script got written approved and produced? Ridley Scott will stay in the pantheon of course, for Alien and Blade Runner, but Prometheus? Those whom the Gods would destroy.... I'll be trading in my copy at Amoeba toward something good.",1356998400,,875,4.905405405405405
4773924,3,B005LAIHY0,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHIN!

I liked ""Prometheus"" a lot, but there are just a couple of really important things I found wrong with it.  I found I wanted to give it two scores, which of course is not possible under the auspices of  Amazon.  I decided, therefore, to treat the film as if it were allowed to get those scores, then average them.  Hence, the three points.

THE GOOD:

It is stunning from the opening shot: a sweeping, panoramic vista lies ahead, one in which nature is seen in its forbidding glory.  It is the Earth in its formative days, and as the camera swooshes along, the viewer soon finds himself at the top of a waterfall where a Prometheus, indeed, stands in all his glory: a huge, silvery proto-man who drinks a liquid under the shadowy form of an nearby spacecraft.  It can only be his species' ship, and we watch the liquid take effect his body granulates, crumbling into the water and washing over the falls, apparently on its way to seed the planet with his DNA.

Several million years later we find ourselves in the near future, and we are now part of an archeological team that has made an apparently stunning discovery in Scotland.  It is one more piece of a puzzle they have assembled, culminating in a plan to discover our birthplace in the stars.

It's a glorious and stirring opening, very much like Spielberg might have done it.  It is done with little dialogue, little formal exposition, but the objective is clear to all (though at the end of the movie there may be more questions than answers). It's an excellent start worthy of a promising movie concept.

This kind of epic, iconic storytelling is director/producer Ridley Scott's forte, and it is one for which so many have been on tenterhooks: the prequel to the equally iconic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Blu-ray/dp/B004RE29T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien [Blu-ray</a>] made in 1979.  It's a daunting task, as over thirty years have passed since the original.  Pleasing everyone will be an impossibility.  But does he come close?

""Prometheus"" is lush and breathtaking throughout.  Whether you are traveling along with them in their spaceship, or on the planet where the clues to our ancestors may rest, the movie is beautifully rendered and/or photographed.  The setting, therefore, is one of the GOOD points.

I can say the same thing about the special effects, which are awesome without being overpowering...I really dislike movies whose makers have decided that good CGI is abundant CGI, and therefore every shot has thousands of soldiers or ridiculously sized monsters or packed cityscapes full of so many clever gimmicks and gadgets that the scene is impossible to comprehend.

Thankfully, Ridley gives us sumptuous shots and amazing FX without these drawbacks, and the ultimate effect is positive: grand planetary vistas, frighteningly forbidding chambers, and monsters that can hide in a drop of black fluid.  Again, done very well.

So...the beauty, pageantry, and special effects win ""Prometheus"" a 5.

And then we get to the story.

THE BAD:

It's not so much the WHOLE story...just parts of it.

I get it that this crew has been selected to travel across the universe.  I get it that a millionaire--hell, billionaire--is funding this expedition, and he's not only hand-picked the crew, but also hired one kickass captain to command the mission.

BUT: If these are the very best scientists in their field, there is a pretty sad dearth of scientists around.  First of all, the team has no PLAN.  They never work on a way to approach the site.  They land and immediately rush out of the ship.  When they find a site where interesting specimens might be there is never any caution...they simply go right after it.  And not only do two of them miss their transport back to the ship right before a hellacious storm, but they find REAL LIVING ALIEN BEINGS and get all gootchy-gooey with them...saying, ""Come on, little feller.  Come on...ooh, you're so cute. Come on over here...""

AND YOU'D NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENS.

Honestly, this REALLY detracted from the movie.  It was so beyond STUPID, even IMBECILIC, that I felt as if the movie were insulting me.  And a lot of the later behavior seemed similarly ridiculous.

This bothered me for more than the obvious reason...I felt that it really hurt a good movie.  I know there are a lot of people who feel the movie was faulted because it didn't answer all their questions about ""Alien,"" but that didn't bother me.  (I'd heard that there was one more film coming, PLUS the film itself pretty much says so.)  And as to the other main complaint of many fans: I simply don't hate films that leave me with questions.  Why can't they?  Isn't life like that?

But those DAMN scientists, and the whole crappy team of idiots on that ship...they really did, and still do bother me.  It spoke to such a lack of credibility.

That aside, I really loved how beautiful ""Prometheus"" looked, and I loved the overarching story.  In fact, in almost ALL other ways, I loved the movie.  So a 1 for the plot line, and a 5 for the technical beauty of the movie.

Make up your mind: if you want to see a really beautiful, gorgeous movie that ALMOST answers your questions about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Blu-ray/dp/B004RE29T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien [Blu-ray</a>] rent (or buy) ""Prometheus."" But when those damned scientists get to work, close your eyes...",1356998400,,5501,4.995599559955996

my impressions on this movie

  ~ ~ ~

Why do they have to puke at the beginning of the movie?

Why do they not want to be friends?

The old man with the plastic head was a clone?

Why behave scientists like pre-teenagers?

In ten minutes? Was she pregnant too?

The most intelligent life-form was the worm?

Why can't they build a machine that does not hold the fish above your head when you do a fish-abortion?

Why do these helmets look like big fish-bubbles?

To Charlize: it was not nice to burn your teenage crew member.

 ~ ~ ~ ~

Ok - the geologist loves rocks and all the others don't.

Ok - the storm will have to wait because they need more time.

Ok - they can revive the head but it stinks and explodes and I guess they have never seen that before.

Ok - they mixed up the DNA probe.

Ok - you only get a blurry picture if you look back in time?

Ok - they cannot send a robot to explore the planet, no they want to get killed themselves, what more is to improve there?

Ok - they came to this planet to play zoo-director and to tame a worm, which - by the way - wormed the rest out of them.

Ok - He ate too many fish on this fishy planet until they came out of his eyes and everywhere.

Oh - he will get used to live with fish in his eye.

Well finally, she is pregnant with a fish. Ups - it is an octopus.

Trouble till the end of time ...

The old man with the plastic head said something wise? No, nothing to worry about.

Good: we leave - because, we don't know.
Bad: we stay - because, we don't know.

So the creator will save them. But no, they were wrong.

Will she wait for the plastic man too?

Well, this creator was sleeping all the time, what do you expect?

Bum Bang - all CGI goes down the drain.

Ups. Charlize? Rolled over by a space-ship?!?

Now the creator will have to face the final fish I guess.

Visually nice, the story falls downs on itself right away; a group of scientists discover, on a far, FAR distant planet, a link to the origins of mankind, questioning the whole God thing and all, and are financed for an expedition to go and check out and gather the possible evidence. Once there they discover a lot more than they wanted to, including learning that the entire human race is in imminent danger of being wiped out. Sadly (especially sad, consider Ridley Scott directed this), the script and plot both contain holes big enough to drive a tank through, and as always in such films it is BEYOND AGGRAVATING to watch characters - supposedly highly-trained and educated scientists - do the truly idiotic/lame things they do, here, to get themselves into trouble.

4774042,2,B005LAIHY0,"If I were able to completely suppress all my critical thinking skills and accept whatever is happening on the screen, perhaps this would have been an amusing movie for me, instead of a maddeningly frustrating one. But I am not able to do that.

Can you accept the premise that a super-rich mogul would spend a ""trillion dollars"" to finance an expedition to an earth-like planet in search of ancient astronauts who might, just might, have been the parents of the human race? Fine. Then can you accept that for this trillion dollar mission they would pick the most unprofessional, unscientific, incautious staff who proceed to ignore every sound principle of archaeological investigation, lab quarantine, and common sense?

If you can't accept supposedly educated, trained, technically skilled people doing one moronic and dangerous thing after another, then about halfway through this film you just might be fighting the urge to throw heavy objects at the screen, or bang your head against the wall.

On the other hand, if you enjoy typical horror films where people, through their typically unthinking behavior, put themselves in greater and greater danger and end up running from said danger until they meet with dismemberment and death, this is the sci-fi equivalent.

This is a blot on Ridley Scott's filmography. Also, the slipcover on the DVD claims that Roger Ebert rated this four stars and called it ""magnificent."" If this is not an out-of-context quote, it is another sign that Roger Ebert's opinion is no longer of any use to the movie going public.

The special effects are indeed magnificent. If that's all you're interested in, Prometheus is five-star material. For me, it fails to meet even the lowest standard of suspension-of-disbelief necessary to enjoy a proper science fiction film.",1356912000,,1801,5.112244897959184

My only gripe (a word I started using years ago after the Alien scene: John Hurt's character to Veronica Cartwright's - quit griping!) is that the Captain and crew - inclusive scientists - were a little too everyday for such a highly funded and important mission, especially considering space flight would have still been in it's infancy in the date suggested (and inferred) - but taking the movie on it's charaters alone, I can see past this one!

By this I don't mean that the answers are unenlightening, uninspired, and boring- which they are- but rather that the entire story is just unnecessary and poorly written and delivered. In a spirited repudiation of the feminist themes of the original Alien, we have the opposite of Ridley in a number of women characters with personalities as complex as table salt and the strength of a thousand tissues. We have scientists who make the cast of Ancient Aliens seem skeptical, family dynamics that fail to stretch belief mostly because they are barely shown and can hardly keep our attention on screen while they are played out. What's more, in a fitting end to any reason to enjoy Alien, we get to have the utter foreignness to the human experience that is the creature in the original film utterly destroyed, ruining not just our experience with this movie but in fact with all of the Alien series.

As a plus, the movie is only unbearably long so that by the time the credits roll you or your conscious mind will be safely asleep.",1356739200,3,1238,4.601809954751131

4774326,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus was one of my most anticipated films of the year. The mysterious Ridley Scott project showed promise of being a modern sci-fi masterpiece while at the same time building off of the world created by a classic sci-fi masterpiece (Alien). Now, I won't go on pretending to be an Alien expert, it's been years since I've seen the original film and science fiction isn't my typical go-to genre. However, I love a creative and imaginative sci-fi flick when I do watch them, and Prometheus seemed like it had everything I was looking for.

Perhaps more importantly than the overall look and concept of the film, the initial reports of the film's cast had me intrigued long before I saw any images from the film itself. Noomi Rapace quickly became my favorite actress from her demanding performance in the Swedish The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and sequels. I've since sought out all her other work I could obtain in the States, and was only more in love. Her exposure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was only a teaser for her U.S. film debut, the true test was her leading role as Elizabeth Shaw in the futuristic epic.

Aside from Noomi, the rest of the cast would leave movie fans dying with excitement. The powerful Michael Fassbender and the always amazing Charlize Theron, along with a promising supporting cast offered much to look forward to. Needless to say, the film set its expectations fairly high, which usually always ends up in fan disappointment. But hype aside, I can honestly say I loved this film. I actually felt that my relative unfamiliarity with the Alien franchise gave me some benefit in enjoying the film, as I didn't put pressure on the film to live up to anything else. I took it in for what it was, and I think that's always the best thing to do when watching any movie.

Aesthetically the world in the film is stunning. The barren wasteland of the far away planet our group of discoverers arrive on has a decrepit yet mystifying beauty to it. The space scenes are gorgeous as well, which are prime examples of how modern effects can be used efficiently. Then there are the ""Engineers,"" who are crafted with such beauty and eeriness. Every aspect of the film visually was spot on, which one can greatly appreciate when watching the Blu-ray. Visually speaking, the film is a work of art.

But of course a film has to be more than eye candy. So does it truly deliver? The story for me was very interesting. Many questions are asked, and just as many left unanswered. Perhaps this is what frustrated some moviegoers, but that's something I can really appreciate about a film. Our main characters, doctors Shaw (Rapace) and Holloway (Marshall-Green) lead the voyage on which they seek answers to the origins of life. We're presented with images of ancient beings throughout the film, and our characters experience several events that only build up the questions and complexity in an otherwise straight-forward plot.

One of the potential pitfalls the film fell victim was its urge to cut to the chase. After watching the Blu-ray, I dove into some of the special features. The commentary on several deleted scenes revealed while certain scenes were cut. These cut scenes added more dimension to the characters, made them seem more real and made us feel more connected to them. They were cut more or less to save time. This is the one aspect I felt held the film down. The mentally intriguing story, astounding visuals and superb cast were the building blocks for a truly amazing film. This is one of those films that could easily be near 3 hours long, and I wouldn't complain (such as with the Harry Potter films). That extra time dedicated to building on the characters gives the film that humanity that makes it more of an emotional experience than a titillating thrill ride.

Putting that one aspect aside, this film was fantastic. Whenever a film comes with a huge hype surrounding it, it's bound to let many down. It's tough to avoid the advertisements, articles and gossip about blockbusters like this, but the effort to do so pays off in terms of enjoying the movie. I loved Prometheus, and it really left me wanting more. I just hope for a possible extended, uncut version, and potentially even better, a sequel that can be as good as the original while making up for what this film left out.

4774327,3,B005LAIHY0,"This film had a lot going for it. It has great special effects, an interesting story, and some ok actors. For some reason, it didn't impress me. The story is about a mission to a distant solar system. The mission is to make contact with the alien race that supposedly genetically engineered humanity. When the space ship gets there, they discover that the planet was being used to produce living WMDs. The purpose of these weapons was to destroy the Earth. We never learn why this was being researched, or when it was going to happen. We do find out that the experiment went terribly wrong. The destructive organisms get loose and kill almost the entire crew of the research ship.

This film seemed kind of out there. It reminded me a little of the Event Horizon movie. I loved Event Horizon, but this isn't even close to that good. It was a good idea, with flawed execution. I don't recommend it.",1356652800,,897,4.537037037037037

It is quite complex and leaves you feeling like maybe you missed some key bit of information.  It's almost as if Ridley Scott had this great big elaborate world inside his head and just failed to convey it thoroughly.

Overall an exciting movie that I would watch again while accepting that I just don't get it.",1356480000,,749,4.679389312977099

The corporation is running an expedition to a planet that the crew believe holds the key to Man's origins.  When they get there though, they find a weird ship by another race that looks similar to us.  There is also the usual stereotypical characters which were hard to watch -- a pair that would make Harold and Kumar proud (thankfully they die before we get too far into the film), a megalomanical corporate sponsor, and an alien ""human"" who not only does not want to talk to us, but wants to kill us!

The Weyland (8) Robot, David, was the show-stealer, who despite his spying and infiltrating, and wishing to experiment on the very humans he was entrusted with, shows what he is ""made of"" at the end.

Ridley Scott really knows how to create tension and fear in a scene and despite everyone saying it doesn't live up to the original in my opinion it doesn't have to, it is a new and thoughtful concept for how it all began. That said I found it as riveting and scary in parts as the original.

What I have always liked about his work is the strong female leads and the fascinating way he creates the creatures with this sort of hybrid sexualized male female anatomy and behavior. He always picks fine actors too, Noomi Rapace is great as the lead and Michael Fassbinder is excellent as the villainous but likable humanoid. The visual effects are superb and work to tell the story creating a fascinating environment, mood and space.

If you enjoy thought provoking films then watch this, a couple of throw away characters bulk up the cast but  as I said it left me wanting more.",1356393600,3,1004,4.445652173913044

The quality, box art, all that's great. Getting four copies for the price is actually a great deal.

On first watching the movie itself is pretty much what you would expect from an action / adventure scifi movie. But upon rewatching it a second and third time I really picked up on things I never noticed before. Things that made the story a bit clearer.

The movie has great visuals and the most actors played well (Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbinder,...) but the script and the story of this movie are crap. I can't believe that Ridley Scott is responsbile for it. The same director of movies like Gladiator, Alien and Black Hawk Down.

The theory of ancient aliens (I don't mind) mixed with modern creationism (bulls***) are the concept for this movie. Furthermore the script of this movie is science hostile. All the scientists on board of the Prometheus act stupid or say stupid things. The only survivor - of course - a believer.

4775277,2,B005LAIHY0,I would recommend the standard version of this movie. The movie its self is good but the 3D effects are minimal and far from impressive. It looks as though they put just enough in to get the 3D stamp. If you're looking for a movie to show off your 3D setup check out the Avengers 3D.,1356220800,,283,4.071428571428571

4775279,5,B005LAIHY0,This is one fantastic movie.  It has the viewer asking so many questions and waiting for the next movie to come out and explain the why.,1356220800,,136,4.230769230769231
4775280,5,B005LAIHY0,This movie surprised me on how it seamlessly fit in with the alien series at the end. I bought the alien anthology just to watch them again.,1356220800,,140,4.222222222222222
4775281,4,B005LAIHY0,I liked this movie despite all the bad reviews. It was entertaining and had a decent story. Overall I'd say it was well worth the $3.99 rental. I'll wait until it gets cheaper before I buy it but I will add it to my collection eventually.,1356220800,,238,4.195652173913044
4775282,4,B005LAIHY0,I really wanted to see this movie in the theater but just couldn't find time. So I preordered it because it looked good and I heard some good things about it and some bad. It's not a horrible movie but the deleted scenes do explain the story better. Blu ray looks good and a decent price for a decent movie.,1356134400,,307,4.133333333333334

4775286,5,B005LAIHY0,"After seeing this is the theater, I have been revisiting the original Alien series to see how it flows and overall, it does a nice job for the first couple of movies, which is all I could expect.  The writers did a great job setting up the story for 'later.'

My main gripe is that while I normally park most of my critical thinking in movies like these, some things in the end were just beyond my tolerance for feasibility.  I won't ruin it for you, however.

The filmmaking is superb, and if you ever get the chance to see it in 3D, make sure you do so. It is one of the very few movies to look better that way.  I can count on one hand the others.",1356134400,,650,4.007751937984496
4775366,5,B005LAIHY0,The filming was done very well.  It was even a little scary.  I could not get over how it tied in the old Alien type monsters into this scenario.  I guess we are stuck with the Alien monster as the ultimate destroyer.,1356134400,,217,4.119047619047619

4775368,1,B005LAIHY0,"The only thing that would have made this a decent movie is if the girl had died on the planet and the engineer had gone to earth and targeted everyone associated with this movie.  Pull out the original Alien and watch it instead of this and you will be much happier. Never liked any of the characters.  The ""scientists"" make the worst decisions. They have recordings of the holograms from the planet but don't seem to have audio of the crew getting attacked?  Really?  The can tell exactly where their flying probes are at but not the crew?  Really? Save youself time and money, find another movie.",1356134400,8,598,4.5514018691588785

4775371,3,B005LAIHY0,I watched the extended preview and it looked really interesting so I rented the movie for 24hrs and I gotta say it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.  I mean the movie was okay but there were scenes in it that reminded me of Aliens and I didn't like that.  Makes the movie seem not very original.  I was hoping to see something new but unfortunately it didn't happen with this one.,1356134400,,394,4.226666666666667
4775372,3,B005LAIHY0,"I saw this movie in 3D and was not impressed with either the storyline or the 3D visuals.  I have seen all of the Aliens movies and consider the original Alien one of my favorite SciFi movies of all time.  Prometheus has a weak disjointed storyline that was hard to follow and often made little sense.  Example, the head of Weyland Corp., the company owning the spaceship, makes a holographic visit early in the story, I presumed he was dead, and near the middle end he appears on the spaceship and is promptly killed by the giant, resurrected alien/human.  Similarly the Charlize Theron character bickers with the crew early on and then fades into the background and her role becomes unimportant.  Also, the resurrected giant alien, not the monster but the genetically human giant, starts immediately fighting with all the crew members for no apparent reason. Of course there is included the obligatory decapitated, talking android head who saves the day.

There was nothing exciting about the 3D effects.  If you see it in 2D you will have not missed anything.

In summary, this was a must see movie for me and probably everyone else interested in the Alien series, but it is not one of the better SciFi movies I have seen.  I am glad I saw it.",1356134400,,1246,4.65296803652968
4775373,3,B005LAIHY0,"This was kind of like an episode of the X-Files where all week the teasers said this week's episode will answer many questions, only to find after the episode that you understand what's happening even less. So these super aliens started all life across the galaxy? Or they're out to destory it? And the traditional alien creature we know from the other films is born at the end because why? And we all have the same DNA? Sigh.",1356134400,,426,4.4743589743589745
4775374,3,B005LAIHY0,"It was a good movie, but I'm not a huge fan of this genre. Overall, it was a cool movie, nice special effects, very creepy. I wish we could have learned more about the aliens in it, though.",1356134400,,189,4.0

The film is slow to get going, and I originally rated it about a 3.5...you know, one of those films you can have going in the background while you do your Sunday chores.  However, it got my full attention in the last minute of the show.  And it got the 5.0 rating.  And after the ending, and you're sitting there, thinking to yourself, mentally taking stock of all the stuff you thought seemed familiar...you finally realize all that came before and all that can come from tomorrow.  This might seem cryptic, but it's because you need to see this film.  Trust me, you won't regret it.",1356048000,,743,4.264285714285714

I loved Alien and Aliens and have seen both many times- and as amazing as those both are who wasn't left wanting to know more about the space jockey? Amazing horror, the amazing aliens themselves but you're still left wondering about the otherworldly pilot of that ship. Well you'll get some answers and even more questions and a sizable amount of understanding on where our more recognizable aliens originate. It's definitely a film Ii feel benefits from multiple viewings and the fun of theorizing and speculating on what you're seeing because in my opinion it's not laid out in front of you - it' going to require some thought. I really enjoyed it and definitely felt like this was an aliens movie- if you're a fan of the originals I highly recommend it.",1356048000,,865,4.623376623376624

4775514,5,B005LAIHY0,I enjoyed the way they constructed the storyline of this movie to lead up to the original Aliens movie. Very well done with pretty good drama between the characters and intense action. It answered some questions as to where the aliens came from and why.,1356048000,,253,4.644444444444445

I guess it answers where the Creatures came from - sorta; but, it creates many more questions and leaves them unanswered.  The cast did a credible job; but, they didn't have much of a story or script to work with.  In short, I didn't find this movie appealing as a standalone or prequel.  As a fan of the Alien series, I'm sorta sorry that I watched it.",1356048000,,419,4.253164556962025

4775602,4,B005LAIHY0,I've been a fan/follower of the Alien movies since the first one and I'm very loyal.  Great story and effects.  The only complaint I have is the casting.  Great actors put into less then optimal roles.  A bit too much cliche there.  Maybe if they'd switched roles around with the cast it would have been an easy 5 star.,1355961600,,319,4.338983050847458

4775698,3,B005LAIHY0,"I think Ridley Scott relied too much on his ""smoky, low-audio discourse, darkly-photographed with horrific creatures"" formula that was so successful in Alien and Blade Runner.

Not quite a complete meal so I was wanting more meat on the bones in regards to story, ancient civilization, technology. I wanted to be overwhelmed by the ""anthropology"" of the myth behind Aliens. I don't know if it was the director that made this production a bit too ""mature"" for my liking.

4776466,4,B005LAIHY0,"MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)

Sir Ridley Scott is back...to making smart sci-fi movies. Prometheus (2012) is his ""prequel"" to the Alien franchise that he started in 1979, and his first sci-fi film in 30 years since his cult favorite Blade Runner (1982). I REALLY wanted to LOVE this movie. Not just like it, but all-out love it.  If only Scott had a better story to match the greatness of everything else that he brought to this fantastic visual and aural blockbuster. Still, there's a lot to love here. And maybe my expectations were so high that there was no way for the film to ever live up. I just saw it yesterday, so I probably need more time to fully appreciate all its details. But my initial take on Promtheus is that it's very good, but not outstanding and not Scott's best work. Sorry, Sir Ridley!!! You know I love your work though. Gladiator (2000) is my current #1 movie of all time. And Thelma & Louise (1991) isn't far behind.

Prometheus is an origin story, much like every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the last decade. But this is about the origin of mankind, not some superhero. So it's grounded in something more realistic and relevant...at least initially. It's picking up the gauntlet thrown down by director Stanley Kubrick with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). If only it didn't just pick it up and then put it on the shelf to be forgotten about. The movie opens with two archaeologists discovering a 35,000 year old cave painting in Scotland that has 6 orbs floating in the sky of its drawing with a large humanoid pointing at them. It's in that 35,000 year old mystery, that the story got me VERY intrigued, in the same way Stargate (1994) got me with it's ancient Egyptian alien archaeology. However, instead of really delving into the origins and mysteries of life on earth and the big questions of is there a God and how did the universe come into being, Prometheus simply turns into a guts-and-glory horror action flick halfway in. At that point, no one, human or alien really cares anymore about the big questions of life that got this whole journey started. They're simply concerned with killing life at whatever cost.

I love that the humanoid aliens seemingly created us, but now want to destroy us. But WHY? I don't need a definitive answer, but couldn't we have at least played with the question for awhile after asking it? But maybe that's all Promotheus was ever supposed to give us. I guess I expected more from Sir Ridley Scott at this stage in his filmmaking career. I wanted him to bring the smarts and finesse in his other great films to this one. Now, maybe, just maybe, these questions are meant to be looked at in more detail in Prometheus 2 and 3, which seem likely to have been on Scott and 20th Century Fox's minds during the production of this first one. But as a moviegoer, I want each movie to be complete and great on its own merits as well as across its subsequent sequels if and when they happen. What if we don't get another Prometheus? Then we're left with a movie that's really just a one-act ""trailer"" for something that could have or should have been. I know I'm being harsh on Ridley Scott and his team of thousands that worked hard for years to give us Prometheus. But I expected more from a guy who didn't even make the sequel to his original film that helped start this current Hollywood movie franchise mess.

Ok...now that I've gotten out the bad, it's time for the good. Prometheus is one of the most visually stunning sci-fi movies of all time. It's pure eye candy from the first frame to the last. Every shot, every graphic, every visual effect, and every set/location just wowed me on the big screen in 4k digital projection. This film was completely shot on the Red Epic digital cinema camera and it shows just how fantastic and ""filmic"" digital cinematography can be. I hear the arguments, most recently by director Christopher Nolan, about how digital is not yet at the same level as film, but if Prometheus doesn't put the final nail in that coffin, I don't know what else possibly could. I never once wished that Prometheus was shot on film. It was just so perfect in digital. In fact I don't think it could look as good in film, especially with all the visual effects. I give Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski and his camera team kudos for helping craft one of the best looking movies ever. This movie, and Wolski, better be a candidate for Best Cinematography at next year's Oscars.

In terms of acting, Michael Fassbender once again steals the show...this time as an android named David. But most of the cast does a fine job in their contributing roles. I didn't really like Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw though. I think a better actress could have brought more to the role, but she's satisfactory. She's the protagonist that we are being told this story through the eyes of, and maybe that's partly why the story didn't sink in with me as much as I wanted it to. Her character just didn't have the human and emotional character depth that Fassbender's robot had. And I think that's a problem when the robots are more human than the humans. Sigourney Weaver brought something more to the party in her role as Ellen Ripley. Idris Elba was great as the ship's captain, but I wanted more of him. And Charlize Theron played a ""bitch"" as good as anyone can. That's a compliment by the way. I would've liked to found out more about the humanoid aliens that created us. One would assume they are as intelligent as us, if not more, but we're given no one to connect with. Too bad.

The production design on Prometheus is breathtaking and epic. I can't even imagine all the work by hundreds if not thousands of people that went into designing and building the sets, ships, vehicles, costumes, and props of this world. Arthur Max brought the same greatness to the production design of Prometheus as he brought to Se7en (1995), Gladiator (2000), and Black Hawk Down (2001), all three visual masterpieces.

The sound on Prometheus is just as epic and important, if not more so, than the visuals. And the entire sound team executed with precision and power. There's really nothing else to say about it. You just have to hear it in a huge way on the big screen and you know exactly what I mean. The music on the other hand, by composer Marc Streitenfeld is a mixed bag. Half of it is perfect and the other half felt weird to me. Some of the music just didn't fit emotionally in my opinion. I noticed several times that I was taken out of the storytelling because of the music creating the wrong mood. I was surprised because I certainly didn't expect the musical score to not fit on a film like this. I can't really think of any sci-fi film that it hasn't fit on.

While Prometheus doesn't quite live up to the high expectations I had for it, the bottom line is that I ABSOLUTELY 100% suggest you see it.",1355616000,2,6872,4.5391444713478615

4776511,4,B005LAIHY0,"Like many people I followed the production of what was initially announced as an Alien prequel with great interest and, when it was no longer an Alien prequel, with some confusion. It's fair to say that my and others expectations were set too high.

But let's look at reality for a moment. There were only two good Alien movies. Namely Alien and Aliens. Everything since then has been a creative failure. Partly that's because the alien xenomorph itself is the epitome of a one note villain. There's really nothing extra to explore. No motivations, no morals.

Prometheus is in many ways an attempt to move onto fresh ground and maybe find out what else there is to see in this universe.

At it's core Prometheus is a simple movie. Much like Alien and Aliens before it, there's a very basic action/horror premise in a remote and isolated location.. And when it focuses on that it works.

But the problem is that Prometheus desperately wants to be more. It's a creation tale. It's a moral about biological weapons. It's about faith. And all of that really weighs down the early parts of the movie.

It's trying to do so many things at once, that several of the characters really never get the development they deserve.

But for all that, once it gets going it really never lets up. There are some strong central characters (particularly Michael Fassbender's android) that are easily capable of carrying the action forward. The visuals are, naturally, stunning. And it does carry a lot of the feel of the original Alien movie.

So a qualified success then. I just wish it hadn't taken itself quite so seriously.",1355529600,2,1609,4.725

That is the fact that I can not watch the alternative begging and ending scenes as well as other additional scenes that was not included in the theatrical version in a real full movie edit , instead had to watch them separately with no option to watch them in the whole movie context .

Piece of advise, keep the story line and do not insert any religion.

It is obvious that there was a lot of money spent on this movie. The acting is good and so is the computer animation. To me the main failure of this movie is that they try to do too much with one movie. If they would have broken up this movie into 3 parts, they could have explained much of what seemed to be rushed.

basic premises of good and bad films?  How much they would have liked something more if it had gone this way or that?
If a movie had shown this, the actors done that, or the plot developed to this end?  Double-you-tee-eff!!!  Yeah, that's right, I typed it out.
Wouldn't want anyone to get 'confused' now, like a few who couldn't follow this story and are now backlashing online.
Who in the world cares what you wanted something to be, what about what it already is?  If I have to see or hear your opinion, make it something
worthwhile and informative.  'This is a waste of money' does not cut it.  My absolute favorite was the guy sitting behind us the second time we
went to see it at the theater standing up at the end and saying, ""That's it?""  In the words of Monday Night Football analysts, ""Come on man!!!""
I hope I speak for a majority of the real fans of movies out there when I say, ""Who Cares, Dude!!!""  I don't care about YOUR expectations, I don't
care about how badly YOU THINK the actors did their part.  Most people's opinions are useless and uninformative at best, even those who get paid
for theirs.  Please don't waste my time, any other fan's time, or Amazon's type space to tell us who or what you've 'LIKED' on facebook as far as
movies and actors/directors.  This is not facebook.  Go back and check out the 'Was This Review Helpful' section of your drivel and witness firsthand
the disparaging ratio of 'yes' to 'no' if you don't believe me.

And why were people reviewing the movie on here before the DVD was released?  Again, WHO CARES?!  And if I have to see one ""more"" unpunctuated
or, overly punctuated sentence,., one more mistspeled <- word, or one mor gramatuecal arrors, I'm gonna P-U-K-E!!!!  Why should we listen to your
suggestions on improving the film when you didn't take the time to improve your review?
People, if you see things like this, disregard everything in the rest of the so called review.  Oh, and about those who miss Sigourney, there is
a group of fans out there who cheered when Ripley died in Alien3, so I don't want to hear it and neither do the rest of us.

I'll step down off of my own soapbox now.

The fact is, this is a great movie, one of the best of the year, and one of the best sci-fi movies ever.  The quality is high in all aspects,
don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The production is great, the cinematography is excellent (of course), and the acting is great for this movie.
Oh, and guess what, the CG effects don't ruin the movie like almost all of the other sci-fi films of recent memory.  Nobody's going to win any
awards for their performance, but the crowd who watches these pictures doesn't give a hoot.  The Academy usually rewards
over-actors anyway.  Thankfully, you won't find any of them in this film.  These things being said, if you need anyone to tell you their opinion
of Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi filmmaking before you see it for yourself, you have no business watching it in the first place.

The only bad thing about the whole experience is that the movie actually asks more questions than it answers, which will most likely be mended
with subsequent sequels, the limits of which are unfathomable at this point.  They've set themselves up to do even more great things with a separate, yet
interconnected, series with this film.  If they continue on the path the ending suggests, we could have an epic, and I mean EPIC series!!!  Yeah,
the story doesn't explain all of itself in this one sitting, but praise to the filmmakers and writers for not making this an episode of Law and Order,
so cut-and-dried from start to finish.  THANK YOU!

The DVD is paltry, most are nowadays, with only deleted scenes (the best special feature of any movie anyway).  The menu is designed well and is
themed around the visuals of the film.  The only thing is, if you've seen all of the trailers and TV spots, you'll notice that not all of the
deleted/alternate scenes are here.  I'm with some of the others in hoping for a Director's Cut in the future, just for fun.  I don't think the
film itself needs it, I just remembered and waited for a lot of the scenes in the TV spots to happen and they didn't.  Buy it, rent it, see it however
you wish, but SEE IT!  Don't miss out because of some other 'fan'.  This film is deeper than a lot of people will understand and the questions asked
and answered are bigger than most sci-fi movies have ever bothered to conceive.  As a firm believer in God, I can still get enjoyment out of the
alien-creation stuff because, hey, it is SCIENCE FICTION, and even knowing the real truth for myself, the premise of the movie is still fun and very cool.

P.S. The only other thing that sucks is every cover for this movie.  There was so much more iconic imagery that could have been used.  Again...Director's Cut?",1355356800,3,4932,4.4465478841870825

Unfortunately, I felt it went on about 30-40 minutes too long, and I didn't find any of the characters in the movie interesting.  In that way, it reminded me of the 'Star Wars' Episodes I-III movies, which also lacked anyone that I cared for; in all of these movies, I was hoping that all of these characters would be killed off in the first 15 minutes, so the real stars of the movie would enter.  Never happened.  We were stuck with the same dolts throughout the picture.

Also, am I the only one who felt that the characters in 'Prometheus' were almost exactly like the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator', another uninteresting and overcrowded group that you didn't mind seeing killed off one-by-one?

Overall, I wouldn't call the money I spent on this movie a waste, but this won't find an honored spot in my movie collection, either.  Ridley Scott should have stuck with a regular 'Alien' prequel.  Maybe next time he will.  At least the alien was interesting...",1355270400,,1308,4.643478260869565

The characters could have used more development and a great many that get killed off have no meaning to the viewer as they were used only as window dressing to start with. The twists and turns of the movie leave the viewere bewlidered and only those few who have a special interest in tracking down rare ind-european languages will be able to know what is said between the Engineer and David and the rabid alien fans will seek to understand the questions that are elf tunanswered at the end of the movie.

One important thing one must realize before watching this film is that while it is based on the Alien franchise (and it does a great job of alluding to it), Prometheus is not a prequel. Instead, it better thought of as a story in a parallel universe. Apart from that, if you're going to buy the movie, you might as well get the 3D/BD/DVD combo because this film was meant to be watched in 3D and it is splendid, and you get all the cool extra features.

4777574,4,B005LAIHY0,"Great, very enjoyable movie.  Really well made, looks great, performances are great.  I surprisingly enjoyed the movie considering all the flak I heard when it came out.

Now I get the complaints.  The crew basically do all the cheesy B-Movie dumb ""mistakes"" that leads to full on carnage.  Over and over and over again.  Normally, this kind of thing bugs the heck out of me.

However, this movie hits all the marks on solid performances, tension vs. action, the awesome look, the weird alien twist in the story, some serious carnage, etc.  All of that elevates this movie that should be cheesy as hell, into an enjoyable, smart film.  It helps you accept all the obvious holes in the story.

Now that I think about it, you could say the same for the first two Alien movies as well.  There is a great Ridley Scott signature all over it, which I do enjoy.  You very much feel we are talking the same universe as the Alien series.

Thumbs up flick.  Very much enjoyed streaming it in HD through the PS3.  Worthy.",1354924800,,1010,4.502762430939226
4777575,2,B005LAIHY0,"This was absolutely awful. Instead of giving us another great sci-fi movie, Ridley Scott decided to treat the audience like mindless movie goers. Without going into detail about plot holes and such, there are just two glaring obscenities that I cant get past in this film.

1. Having a creature grow from the size of a grapefruit to the size of an entire room without consuming anything or any explanation of how all that matter manifested itself out of thin air in an hour or two is not acceptable for a sci-fi movie like this to use.
2. Having an antagonist in a movie which is supposedly a highly advanced being should not act like a psychopathic slasher film villain who just runs rampant through the scenes flailing his arms about attacking people with no rationale behind their actions.

There are certain aspects of cinema that we come to expect from super hero movies and magical beings in fantasy settings that are purely for action; or mindless illogical actions from slasher and horror movie villains purely for the fear factor, but neither of these are acceptable for a sci-fi film of this caliber to use.",1354924800,,1117,4.723076923076923

You always hate to see the legacy of past films tainted by mediocre follow ups that are nothing more than tepid attempts to make a quick buck off sentimental viewers who feel compelled to watch because of how much they enjoyed the previous movies.
Naturally, I went to see Prometheus in theaters because of my love of the series, especially Alien and Aliens. Absolutely loved every second of it. I thought the film was visually brilliant, fantastically minimal story line that does enough to draw you in but does not bore you with overwrought details and it did justice to the previous films in the series. Therefore, I knew I had to get it on its Blu-Ray release.
The movie itself is a reminder of why you bought that pricey HD television in the first place, a must have in your collection of high def movies. The 4-disc colllector's edition has a lot of great bonus material and I feel Scott himself put great effort to make sure the viewers get their money's worth.

The hard scifi grit is repalced with an almost liberal arts science expedition attitude mixed with oh my gosh evil corporate plot that never materializes.

4777819,1,B005LAIHY0,"Yes, this is full of spoilers, but really the movie is so bad that it doesn't matter...

I just wasted two hours of my life.  Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge sic-fi fan.  I loved Alien.  Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies.  But this movie just didn't make any sense at all.  None of the characters were developed.  About half of the crew only appeared on the screen to die.  The ""science"" didn't make any sense.  The actions of the characters didn't make any sense.

Questions: Why would the biologist run away from dead bodies and then try to play with an aggressive alien ""snake"" thing?  How could the ""engineer"" DNA match human DNA even though they look totally different?  How could a geologist who just mapped the entire cave system with his probe ""pups"" become lost?  Why would the head of the corporation hide on the ship instead of just being honest about it?  Why does no one seem to care to ask why a woman (who just gave herself an emergency C-section) is running around the ship in her underwear covered in blood?  What happened to the characters who tried to subdue Shaw (I'm pretty sure she didn't kill them, but they never seemed to appear again)?  And, for goodness sake, why don't they run sideways when the ship is rolling towards them?  Oh, there are so many more questions!

Since this is pretending to be a prequel, let me trace how we get to the xenomorph that we're more familiar with from the Alien franchise:
1.  In the beginning of the film one of the ""engineers"" swallows a bunch of black dots which then completely destroy his DNA and cause him to disintegrate.
2.  Android puts a single one of these black dots into the drink of a human so human becomes infected with DNA destroying substance.
3.  An hour later, infected human has sex with another human and she becomes ""pregnant"" with...something.
4.  Infected man is burned to death, but then reawakens as a transformed maniac zombie that proceeds to kill everything in sight for no reason.  This is never explained.
5.  After 10 hours, pregnant woman gives herself a C-section and some sort of alien is pulled out.  (But it's not THE alien!)
6.  After another day, this alien manages to grow into a 10 ft long tentacled beast.
7.  The alien beast then infects an ""engineer"" (who is also a maniac killer for reasons unbeknownst to me) by jamming a tentacle down his throat and enveloping him.
8.  An unspecified amount of time later, the engineer's chest bursts open and something crawls out.  Now, finally, we have the xenomorph!  And then the movie ends.
Summary: Black dot > human > sexual transmission to another human > alien > engineer > xenomorph.
And this makes sense, how?  And don't tell me it all makes sense because there are some fracking Easter eggs or that the storytelling is so deep that it's beyond my comprehension.  Rubbish!

Oh, and if you knew an alien race was building up an arsenal and planning to come to Earth to destroy all humans, and you meet one of these aliens and he immediately tries to kill you, would you then decide to go to their planet to ASK THEM WHY?  If she had said: ""Hey, android head, let's take one of their ships and go kill these crazy aliens!"" then I could understand that.  But instead she thinks that if she shows up on their doorstep they'll be amenable to questioning.  Seriously.  Ridley Scott should be ashamed.",1354838400,8,3370,4.5198675496688745

4778069,3,B005LAIHY0,"Part ALIEN VS PREDATOR and part Chariots of the Gods, PROMETHEUS is a beautiful but convoluted mess of a movie that manages to breath a tiny bit of life into an old franchise, but not much else.

The plot - which is more or less explained in the trailers - is fairly simple:  80 years into the future scientists find evidence that aliens have been to earth - and that they've left a clue as to where to meet them.  Naturally, we go to find out what all the cave drawings are about and predictably, things go terribly wrong.

Considering that PROMETHEUS is set in the ALIEN universe (something that only the newest trailers even admit to), nearly every ALIEN fan will immediately recognize the similarities - the alien world, a morally corrupt robot, a large corporation with it own designs, and lots of space ship stuff (both alien in nature and human).  Which is all well and good, but somehow returning director Ridley Scott and writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof still manage to step on their dicks, despite a massive budget and familiar stomping grounds.

The plot is simple, which is fine (it is a prequel to a movie who's sole original purpose was to have someones chest explode from the inside out after all), but so are the characters - all very one dimensional, very flat.  Some of that's because it's just not a great cast - the ""Ripley"" type character is played by Noomi Rapace who is a fine actor, but simply doesn't have either the charisma or physique to pull off her role in this film.  Other roles are just as flat.  Ironically, only Michael Fassbender as the robot is interesting in the slightest.

Besides the flatness of characters, they also act unbelievably - a death knell for any scifi movie, no matter how big the sets.  Characters take off their helmets in what's clearly a f'd up looking spaceship where shit's gone wrong - 'cause that's safe.  When they discover what should be the biggest thing in history, they seem no more amazed then if they had just bought a Happy Meal and the toy was broken.  They then leave that discovery because it will be getting cold outside - not 150 degrees below zero cold mind you, just cold.  I guess the trillion dollar expedition forgot to bring matches for a fire.  Just totally unbelievable.

No sense from the script (which is set so relatively near in the future) if there's even been any other alien life discovered before this trip or even when warp drive was discovered.  It doesn't seem like the adventure of a life time to these characters (which of course it should), but more like a pain in the ass trip to the corner store for diapers.  When they see the giant human head statue found on a deserted world in the middle of dead space, no one bats so much as an eyelash.  Absolutely the wrong tone.  Even the characters in the original ALIEN - who were nothing but glorified space truckers - took more glee in their potential discovery.

Equally stupid are the character's actions - Somehow 2 characters get lost 50 feet from the front door of the alien ship.... then even more inexplicably are left behind there b/c no one knows they're missing.  One guy gets infected by what I guess is an alien, but says NOTHING (you know, even though they're on a trillion dollar scientific research spaceship).  Just dumb, both in believability and in tone.

Just as wrong in tone is the music, which half the time is brilliant (when he channels Jerry Goldsmith) and the rest of the time is just awful.  For some unknown reason, Scott must have instructed composer Marc Streitenfeld to write ""hero"" music for the ""Prometheus"" alien, which any time it's played take one immediately out of any sort of suspense that might have built up to that point.  Absolutely stupid and again it makes one wonder just how Scott could have made such a plainly wrong decision - it is a horror movie after all, right?  At other times, when the shit hits the fan, the music is so loud and so wrong that it literally kills any danger that characters you barely care about might be in.

And lastly, the continuity errors.  Just oodles of them when compared to the original, including two so huge they had to be on purpose... didn't they?

In the end, you really have to ask yourself why this movie was made.  Whatever it does for the storyline could have been done in about a 1/4 of the screen time - and regardless of the storytelling (or lack thereof), it covers much of the same ground that ALIEN V PREDATOR did (without ever telling the audience whether or not we should consider that movie canon or not).  If I sound frustrated, that's because I am.  The ALIEN universe is a cool one, with more then enough story-lines to do something new.  The ""revelations"" this movie shows us are A) predictable and B) underwhelming, both in scope and execution.  At times, just when you think the movie might pull it's feet from the blah mire it's in and reach something special, it falls right back into the goop.

Simply put, a movie set in that universe with a $150 plus million budget aught not be so average.  It feels like it should be a great film, or at least a very good film (mostly because of the amazing sets and CG work), but in the end it's terribly blah.  In the end, I'd have to say that AVP is actually a better movie, b/c while that film doesn't reach nearly so high, it does actually achieve what it sets out to do.

Hate to say it, but after ROBIN HOOD and now this, it's clear that Ridley's lost it.

BOTTOM LINE:  3 I think Michael Fassbender looks like a young Peter O'Toole too! out of 5",1354665600,46,5548,4.48605577689243

4778143,4,B005LAIHY0,"When I saw this movie previewed, I wondered if it was a prequel to ""Alien"".  Even though hype suggested otherwise, I knew that there were too many clues indicating that it was.  Since ""Aliens"" is my favorite movie of all time, I'm obviously biased - That can either work against this movie or for it.  In this case, the movie proved itself worthy, & I highly recommend it.

Although I could give a detailed analysis of the characters, etc., I'll keep this part short & to the point.  ""Prometheus"" effectively combines science & philosophy with action & atmosphere. The characters are believable & relatable, & their personal evolution reflects the storyline's premise:  who are we?

Mythologically, Prometheus was an immortal who gave fire to man & was subsequently persecuted for it by the gods.  Restrained to a rock, he suffered an unending ritual that allowed an eagle to eat his liver; every night his liver regenerated only to be eaten again the next day.  An immortal suffering for us . . . sound familiar?

The way you choose to view this is dependent on your primary philosophy.  I find it interesting that (in the case of this film) these beings essentially provided the building blocks of our lives & then were equally ready to destroy us, essentially playing God.  Yet, it was ultimately out of their control, resulting in consequences they had not intended.  To whom do they answer for their indiscretions?

They were not the brightest bunch to select for a trillion dollar expedition to find our origins and immortal life.  Scott really missed the boat (or spaceship) on the film.

Once I installed the new CD-R with new F/W, the problem was the same, so I returned the set to Amazon and ordered a second copy assuming I got a bad disc. The second one arrived and I had the same problem. Doing some online searching I found I was not alone. Depending on which BluRay player you own, this particular disc may not play.

4778446,4,B005LAIHY0,"The quality is there across the boardRidley Scott does an amazing job in his return to sci-fibut maybe the story is at 90% of its potential. I think I read a review a couple weeks ago that sums Prometheus up nicely by saying it was great, but Ridley Scott couldve taken it even farther. Definitely a good prequel to Alien.

I love the human/alien history aspects of this moviereally makes you think about the other Alien movies and what causes what, where this thing came from, how that got started, etc. The creatures, costumes, sets, and locations are all amazing! It's much more cerebral than any of the Alien movies.

Honestly, all my critiques are fairly minor. One thing that occurred to me afterward was that Prometheus is missing a creepy stalking scene: one of those classic scenes from the other Alien movies where these mysterious monsters are hunting/stalking the main characters in some darkly lit space. Most the creature stuff in Prometheus is fairly brief, with little buildup to the actual gore-fest. The ending (more specifically, the scenes with the old man) felt rushed, and I wouldve liked to have seen the last 30-45 minutes extended an additional 30.

The main actors do a great jobvery convincing. I'm a little annoyed by a couple of the supporting actors at the very end, when they decide to sacrifice themselves for the better good. Their characters aren't built up much, so it seems a bit too convenient for them to just up and decide to die. I was expecting a Private Hudson (Bill Paxton in Aliens) type moment where some character just freaks out and loses his shit  but that doesn't happen. In general, I wouldve liked to have seen a bit more realistic character buildupcrew members joking around and acting more believable.

Overall, an excellent movie I would recommend seeing.",1354579200,4,1809,4.82258064516129

4778451,2,B005LAIHY0,"Well where to start?
First if you go to the expense and trouble to send an expensive ship to a distant planet then you would definitely make sure that the people on board were professionals not some rag tag team. Any kind of encounter requires following safety protocols because of the obvious reason of being light years away from the nearest hospital. Besides that, before breathing any unknown atmosphere you must first study it's chemical and biological makeup before even attempting to breath it. Yet, what is the first thing they do? Remove their helmets and ""test"" the air by breathing it in. I guess they forgot about viruses and bacteria that don't make you drop over dead until days or weeks later.
I know that this was a ""prequel"" for the original Alien movie so many years ago (which by the way they did the very same thing but you excused it because they were hired labor, not scientists). In a slight way we got some answers but in a way were left with many more.
There also seemed to be a bit of a technology blunder as well, this movie the equipment seemed to be higher tech than in Alien and the cyborg more advanced but just as flawed as in Alien.
Finally, I'm not sure what the guy who funded this whole expedition was smoking but it would sure take a lot more than cave drawings for me to part with a trillion dollars. I was expecting more proof that actually pointed to a specific place in space not some general area that would be some billion or more square miles which is a big place to hunt down one small planet. Kind of like looking for a unique grain of sand on all the beaches in the world.
I was disappointed to say the least and the blunders should not have been made, it insults the intelligence of the viewer.

4778522,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm reviewing the 4 disc set. It's not unusual for a DVD to have a lot of deleted scenes but this time you need them all to flesh out the overly refined theatrical release. The 3.5 hour documentary on disc 3 is worth the extra money but I will never buy a new Blu-ray a mere 5 weeks from Black Friday ever again. There is enough here to be very thought provoking which is the mark of an unforgettable movie. I spent an hour online when I got home from after seeing this for the first time. I had a ton of questions but I have to say that repeated viewings has improved my opinion of Prometheus. Fresh out of the theater, I would have had trouble giving this more than 3 stars. I noticed when the DVD was released that the film seemed to have been rebranded to renew interest. The engineer wasn't shown in any of the theatrical release commercials or print ads but the DVD cover features a close up of the unmasked engineer. Prometheus may not be a prequel but unfortunately, there are so many coincidences that most people will leave the theater believing that they saw the derelict ship from Alien crash on LV-426. I think of my years spent wondering if the Alien had a home planet or was made to be a bioweapon. Ridley leaves enough hanging to spark debate and trade theories. It's ambiguous. I also hang onto the tension of whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant. By the way, the franchises for Alien and Blade Runner have more in common right now than ever in my opinion. I've probably said this in another review but the more you know about a character, the less interesting they become. Boba Fett and Hannibal Lecter are good examples. These characters could all come from the same Earth where Tyrell and Weyland are one and the same or competitive rivals. One thing I did have in mind before I saw the movie was a tip from a friend who told me to Google: ""Prometheus Flow Chart"". There's a chart with icons illustrating the four possible outcomes.

There is plenty of hints at the alien movie that this springs from that fans of the original will pick up on, but you don't need to have that history to enjoy this movie. (it does have a similarly shocking moment in the middle that made my wife cringe... very ""scary"") Point of fact; it was never marketed as an Alien prequel, though in the timeline it is... This is a stand-alone movie that may create a sequel in it's own right.

I've not watched the 3D version as I don't have a proper TV. I did watch it in the theater and know that the 3D treatment was very good... I don't know how that translates to the smaller screen but the overall film was so well done I can't imagine it being poor in that regard.",1354492800,,836,4.192546583850931
4778631,1,B005LAIHY0,"I watched the 3 disc blu ray version of this film and it was just so disappointing.

I found the story to be very thin as well as the supplements.  If you want to see actor/director interviews they are in the 4 disc blu ray version.

The look of the film is great but you spent no time with the characters to care about any of them.  I found it laughable when the captain who stayed on the ship the entire time doing very little out of the blue had the 'complete' explanation of the canisters and how they got on the planet and why.

It was a 'what?' moment - just like the Engineers.  Theron had a cameo as well as Guy Pierce - they were completely wasted.

Alien was a home run out of the park.  Prometheus isn't even a convincing punt.

Skip it.",1354492800,2,748,4.068493150684931
4778732,3,B005LAIHY0,"I would like to preface this review by saying I am writing this review based solely on the contents and merits of the film and not any of additional content/features (directors comments, etc.)

After watching this film in the theater and again on Blu-ray, I am left with the distinct impression that this film, despite being enjoyable to watch, just lacks a true identity. For all that this film does well, it is ""Alien"" like but doesn't fully commit to the terror and fear of its predecessor to be considered a true prelude. More importantly, in Alien, the only question being asked was ""How do we kill these things in order to survive?"" and not a series of origin questions--""Who made us? Where did we come from?""

Because the film only half-heartily commits to being association with Ridley Scott's infamous work, it falls prey to a series of too predictable set-pieces that only tease the viewer with what could have been. Honestly, without sharing this symbolism with Aliens, this movie by itself would be quite unremarkable. Outside of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender's characters, everyone else, including Charlize Theron (who is a very skilled and gifted actress) in the film could easily be substituted with anyone else and they would adequately fill the role.

Ultimately, because of the scope of the questions being answered, this movie leaves one with more questions than answers. I would be hard-pressed to convince anyone to purchase it (unless its on sale somewhere during the holiday season). It's worth watching, but I fail to believe that this is a film that one could watch over-and-over again.

However, some of the story has very smart people doing very dumb things and that is what gets frustrating with movies. Sometimes the main characters do things that you hope they would not do in real life. Oh well, it's only a movie. I can recommend it for the visuals and say don't get too upset with the story.

Also some of the graphics, views, designs etc were fantastic -really interesting and well done.

All let down by a completely cliche cast of characters with bad acting.
Really Ridley?
The cigar-chomping fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants captain.
The corporate cold heart who changes the deal at the last minute on the naive scientists.
(one of the scientists looks like a model - with a 3 day beard at all times...hmm, when they're not a cliche the casting goes the exact opposite)
And what REALLY was annoying - the one nutjob geologist. It's hard to fall into the story of any movie and it's nearly impossible to 'temporarily suspend disbelief' with such an imbecilic character. The man is a scottish yobbo- tall, skinny, half shaved head with tattoo's on it while he's 'just in this for the money'...besides being and surly all the time. You wouldn't want him to date a sister- even one you didn't like, let alone hire him on a two year mission that was claimed to cost one trillion dollars. Apparently the trillion didn't include any line items for human resources. I mean, if I walked into McDonalds and he was behind the counter, I'd think the manager was an idiot for hiring him.
Really Ridley? Really? You expect anyone to believe that?
There was also the compete lack of scientific or safety protocols in, well, anything, scientists who acted like 14 year olds, and a host of other ridiculous discontinuities.
The one good character wasn't even human (zee android)- I did really enjoy how he kept channelling TE Lawrence and he was believable.
If all of the characters were of a quality of that nature, the film would have so much improved.

Basically:
It's a train wreck. Worth a watch if you're interested in the whole Aliens genre/universe or just interesting high budget SF, but pass on it otherwise. If you get confused by movies with waaaay too much going on, or want answers to all the questions, don't watch this.
Still, since it left so many questions unanswered, I'll watch a sequel (if they even bother to make one, it was no runaway market success) - after it comes out on Amazon video of course...",1354406400,5,2356,4.741463414634146

4778799,1,B005LAIHY0,"Started watching this movie when it arrived in hopes for better.  The stupidity of the crew in almost every scene sequence made it impossible to buy into the story line in any amount.  That someone would mount what was billed in the early part of the movie as a fantastically expensive mission and staff the crew with idiots without a clue makes the entire plot ridiculous.  I finally turned it off when the idiot reached for the snake/alien.  Still haven't had any interest in even finishing the movie.  To be fair, I'm not a fear induced adreneline junkie, but have seen the Alien movies. I've even rewatched a couple, because Sigorney at least got you to buy into the situation.  You'd think if a movie was going to script a ship visiting the race that started mankind, it could make them look smart enough to have actually made it there.

The movie industry has me as an easy mark for almost anything they put out in 3d, because I love it.  However, offerings like this one could eventually kill it off.  We need movies that will help support the format, not B grade scifi horror movies.  Compared to this movie, the 3D remake of I, Robot was a terrific bargain - half the price for 10 times the movie.",1354406400,10,1206,4.465753424657534
4778800,5,B005LAIHY0,"At the cinema I was polarized: absolutely stunning visuals (especially in 3D) and sound, but a seemingly confused plot; and a lead character trashing the most evidence-established beyond dispute scientific theory on earth (Darwinian evolution) because she is a Christian and ""[she] choose[s] to believe"". And, somehow, this choice of belief translates to a multi-billion dollar expedition, financed only because the CEO of Weyland will clutch at any straw to prolong his life (based, it seems, upon a single person's belief system).

What? Oh Boy! What nonsense!

Ridley Scott did not help by stating ""NASA and the Vatican agree that is almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way"". I cannot believe that the Vatican states this: if it did, it would have to admit that the existence of a theity is nonsense (oh, but wait, the Vatican does not understand logic or reason, only faith and cover-ups - I almost forgot!). I would hope that NASA never agrees with the Vatican - come on! (Of course, the reverse is likely to be true.)

But, I now have the BD and, having just watched it, I am carried away (again, really). No 3D, I'm afraid, but for the first time, my 7.1 surround system is justified. This is stunning stuff.

My original objections haven't really disappeared, but the film now makes more sense (and it is a show and a half!). Shaw's absence of a theory is trashed by just about everyone, but it turns out that she just happens to be right (a bit like winning the lottery). But OK, better that the rest of the crew trash the idea than agree it with it.

Many people have criticized the scenes where the Prometheus collides with the alien ship, the latter falling and rolling: why don't Shaw and Meredith Vickers run sideways, we wonder? Well, this never really bothered me; in moments of crisis, people just run in panic (and do not look over their shoulder and make logical decisions - I know, I once stood and watched my son chop down a tree, only to see it hit an overhead (11 thousand volt) power line. Did either of us run? - nope, stupidly, we just stood looking. And, of course, Shaw does roll to the side at the end (phew!)).

On the other hand, there is a really silly bit where one of the scientists tries to make friends with an alien worm-thing, as though he could talk to it like a pet dog (I couldn't see any ears). Right, very sensible! But, of course, it's designed to make you cringe and shout ""don't be stupid, don't be stupid...."", because you KNOW something horrible is about to happen. Just like you did when, in Alien, Ripley decided she had to go back for the cat (and how stupid is that?). A common and very effective film technique, which emphasizes your tension because you believe that you would have acted differently.

And why do the ""Engineers"" (a brilliant choice of name - and surely confrontational to people of faith - please see footnote) suddenly decide that, after having seeded life on earth, they then want to destroy it? This annoyed me until I watched the BD. At the cinema, I missed Shaw saying ""Why did you turn against us?"". Such lines make a lot of difference, because it means that the film is aware of the perceived logic that we see, and why Prometheus and other films like it (one cannot help think of 2001: A Space Odyssey) should be re-watched multiple times.

Mark Streitenfeld's film score is, incidentally, brilliant. It's on par with Jerry Goldsmith's scores for the original Alien (which it pays homage to) and the Omen trilogy. Highly recommended (listen to it loud).

Scott calls the film ""an original mythology"", putting my mindset into the same place I put it with Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a film I only appreciated when the director said [paraphrased] ""imagine an alternate world in which people can fly"". Of course, it's all alternate -  the only mainstream scientifically realistic SF film ever is 2001, no others need apply. If you really need convincing of this, read Stephen Baxter's ""Ark"".

And watch Prometheus, again and again. It rewards as a film describing an alternate universe (just like Lord of the Rings). And it flows!

I cannot wait for any sequel that might be forthcoming. and I continue to think that Ridley Scott is (selectively) brilliant.

Footnote: Shaw does not seem to understand her own religion, which requires a single non-evolved God. If she believes that cave paintings and future proof of an alien race that seeded the Earth support Christianity, then she has not read her Bible. But, relax, the film is an alternate universe!",1354406400,4,4605,4.698511166253102

4778971,1,B005LAIHY0,"This movie is analogous to a fanciful store that's on Rodeo Drive but when you go inside they actually sell horse manure! Or this is the latest Alien in the fashion of the last Indy Jones movie, it's that garish! Or a pretentious bookstore that only sells porno mags. The mystery of the film is a real presence but once you get to the actual details it just falls apart. I'd like to say this is NOT a Hollywood movie, this is a British cast and production shot on location nowhere near America. Hollywood at least doesn't put on the airs that these jokers to do being sophisticated. The secret of our makers is that they will rip our heads off? Come on!

The thing that even made me watch this was Scotts reputation(even though I hate his clearly British/Scottish discriminatory hiring/casting practices). This movie will dissuade me from taking Scott seriously ever again. I guess I could partially blame it on that awful LOST writer who worked on this but still it's a Scott film. Ugly British actors don't help either. The Brits would be the last ones to get so far in space, the modern ones mind you not the empire ones.

I'm not going to go into all the details but suffice it to say one major example is the UGLY main female actress directs her own c-section by a robotic surgery machine, which patches her up with metal staples (like out of an actual stapler) then gets up immediately afterwards and runs away. Come on, really?  Also they have the obligatory android with his head ripped off, again really? Recycling is great, just not in a movie. And these ""scientists"" are about as competent as teenage girls at the prom. I mean come on, didn't the genius writers and director even think about consulting with an actual scientist or engineer or even oh say anyone on the street when it comes to basic survival and logic skills? If you want an extreme aged old man CAST ONE, don't waste a huge amount of money and time to do a thoroughly unconvincing makeup job on some out of work Brit you want to give a job to.  This tripe is decent for about 40 minutes, after that it's just garbage.

4779089,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus does really well as the prequel for Alien.  It spins a good yarn as they say but when you compare the special effects between the three movies you can see such a big difference it's almost painful.  My one big question is - WHY???? They never do explain that. What did we do? It also shows things like how the medical beds/capsules are more advanced in the past than they were in Alien/Aliens so yeah, some of the stuff really sticks out like that. That advanced medical bed would have helped Ripley out.

Another big discrepancy are holograms in Prometheus where as I remember the scene in Aliens where they had the big screen looking for the colonists in the table looking for them in the sublevels, this was the movie made how many years later too!  Some of the alien eggs are different too.  As a matter of fact so much of the movie is different I need to get the book so I can better understand everything what was going on.  The ending was a bit trite and would anyone in their right mind do that after what he did?  I guess she didn't know what he did to her guy but eventually she'll find out.  One thing that was a high point of the movie is how they showed the ""giant"" chamber from Alien where they showed the giant on the ""couch"" with his chest blown out from an Alien. They show a scene where Hal? the android activates the Giants' system...that scene was way cool and how they accomplished that WOW!

4779090,4,B005LAIHY0,"After viewing ""Prometheus,"" I left the theater disappointed and confused, yet thoughtful.
I was thankful for the high budget visuals (the beautifully shot opening sequence on primeval Earth and the Orrery scene were fantastic) and the intent of the story to at least AIM for something more substantial than the usual sci-fi fare. But the movie is impaired by trying to be too many things to too broad an audience and I think that makes it somewhat unsatisfying for most people, to some degree.

Check out the discarded parts of Dan O'Bannon's original script and artwork (1975?) of ""Alien"" for many of ""Prometheus`"" ideas, if you've got ""Anthology""( Blu-ray) or ""Quadrilogy""(DVD).  O'Bannon's script had the pyramid (or silo [from Geiger], also used in ""AVP"" on Earth), canisters (instead of eggs) and squid-like facehugger.  Eggs were generated by 'cocooning' (see the cut scenes from ""Alien,"" re-introduced in the Director's cut).  Cameron created a continuity issue with his introduction of the `queen' into the alien's lifecycle in ""Alien 2.""  In ""Alien 3,"" Fincher modified the `chestburster' phase of the alien's lifecycle, adding the `Bambi-Burster' (it gestated in the same way as the ""Deacon"" for the last gratuitous shot used in ""Prometheus"").  In summary, much of what happens in ""Prometheus"" has gone on before and what's left is the story of the `Space Jockeys,' which I've wondered about since'79.  It answers some of those questions but I guess I've still got to wait for the inevitable sequel(s).  I just cross my fingers that Ridley will still be around to direct it. He's getting up there.

The Blu-ray clears up much of the confusion. It seems that many people don't have access to the deleted scenes or features that answer many questions and spell out much of what was going on; either thru the two commentary tracks in the main film, or the text and audio commentary provided for every deleted scene, plus the supplemental bonus features.  It convinced me to upgrade my 3 star rating.  Without the BD content, I'm afraid I'd downgrade it.  Yeah, it should have been up there on the screen in the first place; but was cut to reduce running time, improve pacing, or maintain the mystery (aka create the need for a sequel or Director's cut). It might have been a much better 150 minute movie.  As is, it functions best as just a blockbuster set-up for ""Prometheus 2.""

Let's hope next time that Scott delivers.",1354320000,2,2429,4.921568627450981
4779091,4,B005LAIHY0,"If nothing else, to the open-minded, the film is at its very least thought-provoking. Without going into what inevitably becomes one of science fiction's most successful franchises, Prometheus was a standalone production that sought to open the debate of the creation of man, without definitively explaining it. It firmly embraces all possibilities, giving validity many if not most scenarios.

Honorable mention to Noomi Rapace as the passionate and spiritual (Shaw). A character who sought to flesh out the unanswered questions of creation her religion may have left to question. Michael Fassbender as the mission-minded (David) illustrated how only true talent can remove enough of the ""humanity"" in the character to make a believable non-living being.

The film was beautiful in color, texture and detail. It truly encompassed how the most skilled artists and producers stretch the limits of modern technology. Filmmaking should always raise the bar of expectation in its approach to bridging reality with fantasy. The film is a visual butterfly, evolving into something more stunning to the eye as moments passed.

As much as I liked the very concept of the film the scope of the entire endeavor seemed quite oversimplified in some ways. The thought of humans traveling that deep into space was quite grand. Not touching on very real possibilities of sickness, dementia and a host of physical and mental conditions that would have developed from the trip alone ignored reality to some extent. This is not even mentioning how much something like this would really cost.

For Sci-Fi fans this one's a thinking person's gem. View it without the intentions of making it what you want it to be. Guns-blazing, alien-swarmed film this is not. But what it is a very cerebral exercise in ""What if?""",1354320000,2,1794,5.154639175257732

I came into this movie thinking that it would be similar to Alien because this film is set in the same fictional world, but after watching it I can say that not all Alien fans will be satisfied by Prometheus. Although this film really has no similarities to Alien it is still a great movie that really combines great cinematography, Special effects, and visuals. The acting was great especially on the part of Noomi Rapace, but I do think that Charlize Theron gave only an okay preformance. The story could have progressed more but I guess the next film may do that.

The movie itself? I'm truly amazed by how divisive it has become, but it's understandable. I love the film, but I acknowledge that the scope of the film and the performances of Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace are hurt by some bizarre writing choices involving characters doing unimaginably stupid and out-of-character things for horror-movie convenience.

People seem to think this movie sucks because it doesn't answer questions. However, I'm extremely happy it doesn't. For the first time in years, a large-scale film treats its audience like adults and refuses to spoon feed us exact answers to the large questions it poses. Those are for US to decide for ourselves, for US to contemplate. For that I am thankful.

Despite the shortcomings, I enjoyed the film very much from a contemplative sci-fi and entertainment movie standpoint. I suggest people see it, but be sure to rent before you buy. After all, whether or not individuals like this movie is very hard to predict.",1354233600,3,1084,5.112994350282486

I will have to admit, it took me several months to watch Alien from beginning to the end without closing my eyes during the really gross scenes. It wasn't until I watched the making of Alien that help me to move beyond dramatic scenes and watch how they created the aliens. So, when I heard Ridley Scott was creating a prequel to the blockbuster hit Alien I was kinda leary about going to the movies to see Prometheus. But, I ordered the movie and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't as gruesome as the 80's hit. Good storyline, two scientist are granted a multi-million dollar expedition into outerspace to conduct onsite research to find out who/what is behind the start of life on planet earth. What's funny to me is, they didn't have any type of security or planned protection if/when they got there, how to protech themselves.  They didn't have anything planned, no rules of engagement or protocol?!? They just jumpped off the spaceship and ran into a unknown cave and the movie went from there.

Strikingly beautiful imagery.  Engaging storyline, very great cast and crew, excellent production.  Very pleased.

4779460,1,B005LAIHY0,"This is yet another Hollywood product that envisions/portrays life as an extension of, or proxy for, high school. Although the actors themselves are obviously older, they are transparently playing 15 year olds. Noomi Rapace stars as an over-the-top spoiled brat/drama queen. And there are the requisite doofuses and other stock characters of this genre. The characters' ""adventures"" are a result of a mix of their impulsiveness, rebelliousness, recklessness, carelessness, and other compulsive and pointless risk-taking behaviors, enhanced by stupidity and inexperience.

Although it conforms to the teen horror movie convention of having characters take the most unimaginably stupid actions, it does not qualify as a horror movie because the surprises aren't. Plus I had no empathy for any of the characters. And the only (mild) suspense came from monitoring my own reactions: Did I think that this character deserved to die a slow gruesome death, or did I simply want him/her dead quickly so that the movie would be closer to being over? Turned out to always be the latter.

From the reviews, I knew to expect a mediocre movie in terms of plot, but I watched for the visuals. Not worth it. Although extensive, the CGI seemed quite mundane, but it may simply have been overwhelmed by the massive, unrelenting stupidity of the rest of the movie.

And some of the key visuals contributed to the sense of ""stupid, stupid, stupid"". One of the strengths of the ""Alien"" movie was its claustrophobic feel and that it conveyed the impression of a real working freighter -- it was packed, cluttered, gritty, and suffering from wear-and-tear. In this movie, the inspiration for the ship's interior comes from mansions dressed for a photo shoot. The rooms are humongous and sparsely furnished, leaving vast open spaces. Even the oversized beds -- which seem intended to accommodate partying with multiple simultaneous guests -- don't make a dent in the floor space of the various living quarters.

There really aren't enough words to describe how truly awful 'Prometheus' is, but if anyone out there can reply to this review and inform me just what in the hell was/is going on in this strange, mystical canyon bottom...that would be terrific.

No spoilers here, but from what I could gather, some archeologists find some cave paintings and link every cave painting ever discovered to this strange, mystical planet (with the canyon bottom).  It seems odd right off the bat because the paintings and/or etchings are just stick figures any mongoloid would draw pointing to the sky with a couple of circles that, I suppose, represent this moon/planet.

This is where civilization started, but the creators aren't very nice and, from what I could gather, they have created so many terrifying species that nobody can keep track of them all.  You have worms, snakes, lizards, guys who look like the character Powder, squids, and zombies.  There's horrifying black ink, eggs that glow, mosaics that morph, hollow structures with scary-Crazy Horse size skulls carved into them, decapitated bodies, and epic dust storms.  I think Ridley Scott wants us to think that the creators are on a plot to destroy mankind and this must be the case because the pretty archeologist says so even though she just went through an incredible surgery on her abdomen (she's a quick healer, folks).

It's really a complete and total mess and it was difficult for this viewer to truly know exactly what was going on because there are so many different creatures/alien forms to keep track of.  The zombie bit didn't make a lick of sense to me and I was just hopin' Charlize Theron would just torch everyone (including herself, the crew and myself), but at least she got run over by a spaceship.

I mean, man...man, I...I'm trying to remember a collection of dumber characters assembled in one film.  These top of the line scientists embark on a field trip of the dumbest decision making ever captured on film and it's hard to even attempt to enjoy a movie/story when there is so much cerebral floundering taking place.  At least the majority of them get killed, I guess.  Sometimes the dumb really deserve that.  I mean, when your dumb-as-hell neighbor has his garbage disposal running and drops two kernels of Orville Redenbachers into it and then thrusts his arm down there, do you really feel sorry for him?  Of course you don't.  Don't pretend that you do!

Adding insult to injury, the android in the movie looks like Michael Score from A Flock Of Seagulls.  I kept waiting for him to pull his keyboard out and start rotating around the spaceship/set piece made of aluminum foil.

Just really disappointing and really, truly awful.  No true redeeming qualities to it at all and the very ending made me barf in complete disgust.",1354060800,6,2991,4.8046875

I went into this movie with the complete understanding that it was to be a separate story within the ""alien"" universe. I was not expecting a prequel, and quite frankly, I'm happy it wasn't made to be one.

Simply put, this movie gives the watcher different events to analyze and judge for ones self.  It gives the watcher the chance to figure out different aspects and come to ones own conclusions.

I'm not much for reviewing movies, but I wanted to give this movie the positive feedback it deserves.  I rarely, as in almost never, find movies that I ever want to watch a second time.  It's a personal thing, as I know many people who watch movies over and over, repeating lines and what not.  I just can't do that.  But this movie I actually plan on watching a second time very soon.

4779665,3,B005LAIHY0,"We are so starved for a decent sci-fi, anything with a bit of special effects seems to suffice. The plot makes very little sense and leaves you hanging at the end with zero explanation. The really disturbing part is this was one of the better scifi movies in the past 12 years. That doesn't make this a quality movie. They just spent more on sets, props and graphics. Too bad they didn't use original ideas instead of copying Alien.

Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender were the only two bright spots of the film. In fact, their performance was so far above the others, it was clear this film was far beneath their talent. Their presence by comparison, just showed us how seriously lacking of talent the rest of the script, cast and film crew management were. The graphics were also good but nothing spectacular.

The director & writers were simply awful as was the performance of Logan Marshall-Green. The rest of the ship crew were even worse, but that was the fault of the writers & director who designed them that way. The actors were only doing what they were told. Conversely, Logan was simply awful like some raunchy stranger you wake up with, after overindulging at a party the night before. There are so few actors with genuine talent anymore. It just makes you cringe to watch them.

Obviously, most of these reviewers aren't old enough to remember the original alien. Thus, they don't know a copycat film when they see one. This is not just some tie to the original alien. It is nearly a duplicate from the alien growing in a crew members abdomen, to the robot with its own agenda ending up talking with its head torn off (named Dave, of course. Remember 2001 Hal & his voice?).

Then we have a giant octopus generating a claw hammer headed alien (identical to Alien). A bit of DNA improbability. Let's not forget a corporate employer with a hidden agenda. This isn't an alien prequel. It's a full-bore ripoff of the first alien movie right down to the scurvy crew. They had to tie it to alien as a possible prequel & pay them homage (pronounced Ho'mAj not O'mozh) to stay out of copyright court.

You have to picture a crew & 2 field professionals who wake up from 2 year hibernation acting like they've never met each other nor seen the inside of the craft before. Who would go on a 2 year journey without knowing who they were traveling with; or who was in charge or seeing the ship before they boarded? Or having an idea as to what the mission was before they left earth?

Next we have a rowdy, cigar smoking captain into 60's rockstars and a tattooed punk, sucking tobacco in his spacesuit & hating the world. No one would tolerate smoking on a space craft today; much less in 2093. Talk about selling your soul to tobacco sponsors. It was absurd and insulting to the audience's intelligence. After 2 years in sleep, their bodies would surely have eliminated the need for tobacco-if it was even still available in 2093. I would hope not.

The same movie formula which worked on smoking, chauvinistic audiences 30 years ago, does not float today. We have improved society & attitudes a bit since then. Why would hyper-clean, respectable corporate leaders spend Billions on a space journey and hire a bunch of rowdy, grubby, smoking, tattooed bikers as a crew? This wasn't some salvage ship for an ore company.

Not to mention building a top of the line interstellar ship to go to the unknown without including a single weapon for protection except one portable flame thrower? Nary a single weapon for the ship. And you ask why we still hang onto star trek. At least they used common sense about the future.

Then we have the tired stupidity of having our actors run longways under the path of a tall falling object when a simple right or left turn would suffice. It's like those dumb scenes when someone runs down a road with a car chasing them and never consider to run sideways off the road. Plus, they always have to fall down while running if they are females.

I also wasn't happy with the ""everyone eagerly awaiting their parents deaths"" theme. I guess if you are a dropout Xgen addict who can't or won't hold a job... then that would be your only way to succeed to something you haven't earned nor deserved. If this is your attitude, hopefully, your parents have changed their Wills to exclude you. Frankly, I found this dialogue (of someone telling their father he should die and get out of the way so they can take over everything he worked for) quite disturbing. Even worse when coming from a supposedly clean cut, soft spoken, successful offspring who, quite sweetly, tells father he should die so they can pursue their own ambitions with the corporation, money & empire the father built. Whoever wrote this has some serious parental issues. If I was the parent of the person who wrote this dialogue and thematic attitude, I would hire personal security & immediately charge my Will. This was one scary IRL mindset. Since the director also kept this scene (and had an even worse deleted scene for this parental death wish conversation) and the discussion of how ""Everyone"" looks forward to their parents deaths... this directors parents should find this mindset disturbing as well. As for movie value, it really degraded the movie further by ruining any respect this supposedly clean cut character had garnered. We might have expected this from one of the rowdy crew such as the tattooed punk biker type but not the character which spoke the lines.

This movie will not fulfill your need for a new scifi but I guess it's better than nothing. The entire crop of untalented film directors over the past 12 years has become pathetic... not to mention the tired, plagiaristic writers with no imagination of their own. I guess this is all the Ritalin generation is capable of doing since imagination & initiative was bred out of them in exchange for peaceful classrooms.

If being left hanging at the and of a film without any explanation is a problem for you, then you might want to wait until 2014 and watch this with the sequel which hopefully will explain the story & provide an acceptable ending (if they ever get the project off the ground).

4779758,4,B005LAIHY0,"People just love to hate this movie. My advice: If you're interested in this movie, watch it for yourself and make your own opinion. Support art and pick it up, redbox, stream it, do you what you gotta do.

It's definitely a flawed movie, but far from bad. Well... I guess it depends on what you think are bad movies. If you can't stand movies with cheesy typical characters saying cliche shit, then that will probably break the movie for you. I'm not gonna lie, the biggest thing I was disappointed in was the acting. The actors are forgettable and I'm glad they killed off most of the cast and left the only ones worth watching. Fassbender and the main chick did a pretty good job. The rest of the cast, not so much. But as an artist, I really loved the artistic style and direction. The creativity with set pieces, make up, and the scifi aspects were pretty cool. The thing I liked about the technology is that it was subtle and I think you have to watch the movie more than once to appreciate all the creativity that went into everything on screen. The thing that turns me off about most scifi movies, or at least all the cheap movies on the Scifi channel, is that some series/movies go way too far in the future and becomes Trekkie level scifi that only appeal to the scifi nerds. But this movie has tech that, if we were ever to live this long to explore other planets, seems possible in the future and is not so farfetched.

I was really hyped for this film before it came out in theaters because the trailer made it look like the next amazing scifi epic that everyone can enjoy and not just nerds. Needless to say, if any of you were hyped on what they showed in trailers and their ad bits, you were probably disappointed with the final result, and I was a little too. Even the ideas and theological aspects raise a lot of questions, but that's what I ultimately loved about the movie and also what I think people hate on. This movie honestly tries to throw in a lot of ideas about if there really a god, were we created, was Jesus planted on earth and we killed him so now we're paying for it, but I like that there's all these questions. I don't think people understood this movie (which is probably why on the dvd it says in big bold letters ""ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED"") and that's unfortunate. Other people will say it makes no sense. I think it makes perfect sense, if you're a smart logical person. The thing I like about Prometheus and its theological ideas is that it made me do a little research after I was done with the movie and form my opinion of what I think happened and that's ultimately what any writer/director wants, for you to be engaged in the movie and think about it after it's done.

If you're interested in this movie, JUST WATCH IT. It's not a bad movie, it's just not perfect. If you like scifi and art, please support it.",1353974400,6,2859,4.34018691588785

Fascinating.",1353974400,,296,4.764705882352941
4779760,1,B005LAIHY0,"The trailer for Prometheus was nothing short of AMAZING, and although I tried to keep my expectations low due to a recent spate of beautifully executed trailers that had been followed by disappointing movies, I found myself looking forward to the movie with eager anticipation. Prometheus proved however, not to be an exception to the disturbing trend, and was in the end the biggest let-down of all! I suppose this was mostly due to the fact that the Director is one of my favorites, and the original Alien, one of the most enduring classics of both science fiction and horror genres.

I'll just give you a brief overview (only brief relative to how long it could be if I were to really get into all the details) of what were to my eye, serious flaws:

Many the characters behaved in ways that were impossible to explain. They were set up to be highly intelligent, but then proceeded to make unbelievably stupid decisions that resulted in their deaths - some of which, like Charlize Theron's, wound up being unintentionally funny.

The alien technology seemed inconsistent, difficult to believe and in some cases uninteresting. There were rough-hewn stone hieroglyphics that operated crude-looking stone doors and projected recordings, squishy gel buttons and musical instruments that were used to fly the ship, high-tech holograms that seemed way beyond the technology present in the surrounding rooms, and unfathomable tomb/lab/temple chambers that seemed to have no function at all. The derelict alien horseshoe ship in the original movie was so intriguing - it looked biological, but was clearly also technological. When I heard Promethius was being made, I thought ""Oh cool, now we'll finally get to see how this bio technology behaves when it's functioning!"" It turns out that all the ribs and wind-pipes are just inert, interior decoration. Apparently this is just the aesthetic favored by the Engineers for their version of Star Wars corridor paneling. It isn't alive after all, so doors for example, aren't organic orifices, they just slide open like all the doors in every other sci fi movie - such a disappointing extrapolation!

Much of the plot was convoluted and hard to understand. The Engineers needed to clear Earth of all it's disappointing inhabitants, and apparently the most efficient method they could think of was to bio-engineer a menagerie of nasty creatures over which they had no control, and send them here in a small fleet of ships. What if some of the Earthlings found a way to protect themselves from the alien invaders? Even if we are all wiped out, how would they then get rid of the new inhabitants that even in a controlled lab environment they can't seem to subdue? Is the Earth just going to be a total write-off as opposed to a reboot? Then there's the hidden ""invitation"" the Engineers left in all the ancient inscriptions - was this intended to alert them that we had become technological by our deciphering it and showing up on their doorstep? It seemed they had been watching us, and their attack had been well underway eons before this event, so what was the ""invitation"" really about?

The surprises and twists felt a bit arbitrary to me. Why keep it a secret from the crew that Mr. Weyland was on board? In the context of the story, what does this buy the corporation? In the context of the audience experience, what does this buy the filmmakers? Why would the android infect one of the characters with alien spores when he has no idea whether or not the resulting creature could end up threatening the life of his creator/father/boss? Wasn't his mission to prevent Mr. Weyland from dying? What were they trying to achieve by bringing that Engineer head back to life? Were they trying to make it feel pain? A head can't talk without lungs, so they didn't stand to learn anything from it. Was it the black stuff on its surface that made it explode? The other engineers that died at the same time, seemed to have intact heads.

Then there were the counter-intuitive alien life cycles. A ""snake"" forces its way down a crew-member's throat, but then the big surprise result is: nothing! It was apparently just hanging out in the corpse waiting to jump out later and scare the other crew members. Another life form can turn you into a moody, slimy person with a fever and bad skin if you swallow some black liquid, or gestate in your womb and emerge as a giant face-hugger if transmitted second hand during intercourse. Still another turns you into a strong, homicidal, jumping zombie if you get sprayed with its acid blood. The linear life cycle of the original alien was so much more interesting, intuitive, shocking, frightening and innovative.

Even some of the designs lacked that trademark Scott elegance. The weird pin-head alien at the end, in spite of the verisimilitude lent it by current technology, was far less beautiful, disturbing and memorable than the guy-in-a-suit alien in the original movie. The retro bubble helmets reminded me of an era of science fiction that was far more goofy than cool. The silly looking zombie guy who got the ""snake"" blood sprayed in his face was neither scary nor interesting, it just looked like a generic, gory Halloween costume. The old-age makeup on Mr. Weyland, although I've heard people speculate that it was a tribute to the makeup in 2001 A Space Odyssey, was way too hokey for a movie released in 2012.

Much of the movie was stunningly beautiful to look at though, and for this reason I can't in good conscience recommend not seeing it. Additionally, I can almost guarantee it won't ever bore anyone, and the cast is for the most part, top-notch and compelling to watch. I should also say that if there is a sequel, and it certainly set us up for one, I will definitely go see it, although I probably won't be waiting for hours to be the first in line!",1353974400,8,5850,4.790882061446977

4779765,3,B005LAIHY0,"I wasn't planning on sharing my thoughts, but after seeing ""Prometheus"" twice now, and having thought it over and reading over Mr. Wallace's review herein - as well as Mr. Bullock's - I realized I couldn't keep silent.  Firstly, I REALLLY wanted to love this film!  My favorite film of all time is still, after 30 years, ""Blade Runner"", so its not too difficult to figure out that Ridley Scott is one of my absolute favorite directors.  I have enormous respect for his visual acumen and storytelling panache.  I also have great love for the ""Alien"" series (as well as the combo-pack fun of the AVP stories), so when it became clear to me that ""Prometheus"" was a prequel to this series - and basically the founding of the mythos behind it - I was very excited to see it.

Alas, I have to say I was disappointed in many respects.  Visually, Mr. Scott does not disappoint.  The imagery and the characters - both humanesque and nothing-like-human - are exquisitely realized.  We find ourselves in a believable universe where this could take place.  We even get a visual primer, which stems from our much improved understanding of how DNA and Evolution work, as to how the animal life on Earth - and elsewhere - could have come about with such diversity and flourishment (aside from the more likely causes scientific research has given us).  ""Spock"" says it in ""Star Trek II"":  any previously existing life would be ""destroyed in favor of its new matrix.""  The Engineers in ""Prometheus"" appear willing even to sacrifice themselves to foster this new matrix.  That done, in what follows, we're unfortunately subjected to much visual richness and beauty while having to endure stupid humans who are supposed to be the smartest 'guys' in the room.  Not folks you normally find swilling entire bottles of champagne by themselves just because their goal wasn't reached on the first DAY of exploration!?!  What scientist does that?  They usually work for years and years before seeing results!  Things go south from there.

Unfortunately, aside from his dissertative review of the multiple discs for this blu-ray, Mr. Wallace's assessment of the film itself is far from accurate - in fact, it's hooey.  This film IS a horror flick, just like its antecedents; and its meant to be.  It's got the haunted hallways aspect, and a number of well-done gross-out moments; as well as the freaky-monsters-who eat-you aspect.  So all the bases are covered.  The problem with any good ""ghost"" story (scary story) is that you have to find a way to get your characters to be there for the climax - the ""money shot"" as it were.  When you're doing ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"", you're dealing with ordinary or even sub-ordinary folk - people stupid enough to see a dark hallway with blackened rooms on a lightning-filled, 'dark and stormy night' and still make the decision to walk up the stairs (or down) to investigate; of course, to their own gruesome demise!  That's what we've paid for and that's what we get.

With Science Fiction, that particular challenge tends to be brought into specific relief because anything having to do with science requires that the characters dealing with that science must necessarily be experts in their fields.  If they're experts in their fields, they've had to have gone to college - a lot!  In order to be at the top of your field enough to be invited as one of only 17 people to travel through interstellar space to investigate the possible origins of life on Earth, you've got to be extremely focused, dedicated to your field, driven, and clear-headed; in short, the smartest guys in the room.  In order to face the unknown, people of that level of intelligence will have taken every precaution to keep their interference with or contamination of their work to as close to absolute zero as possible.

I'm sorry to say these Promethean ""scientists"" are some of the sorriest, most screwed up (I almost used the 'f' word) bunch of misfits ever to sully the silver screen (well maybe not as bad as those in ""Meteor"" or ""Armageddon;"" I'd forgotten about those flicks momentarily).  The great thing about the first two ""Alien"" movies was that the people involved were just ordinary folk - the ""Nostromo""'s crew were basically glorified tugboat drivers and truckers, and the ""Sulaco""'s crew and company - aside from the fully educated and savvy Ellen Ripley - were a bunch of Marines and a doomed pencil-pusher; no need for high intelligence here.  So because they were normal, ordinary folk like you and me, we were along for the ride with them - knowing that what little more we knew than they would do little to make us think less of them for getting stuck in the path of a voracious species of killing machines.  Not so here:  we expect - nay, we crave - that these experts who've been well-groomed in the ways of the Scientific Method, would follow those sacred protocols and avoid the deep dark tunnels and slimey oil-goo on the floor and the walls.  But NO!

Now in its defense, if our intrepid scientists WERE smart enough to steer clear, it would've been MUCH more difficult to put a two-hour movie together, and that's my point. The fault falls much more on the writers and producers than anyone else.  The writers needed to spend another six months or even year on this script to try and find ways to give us the goods without giving us idiotic brainiacs who blithely give themselves to the devil before our eyes.  And I think that's what Mr. Bullock's review is getting at as well.  He is, sadly, too too correct in his great little quiz - we the viewers are apparently much smarter than the PhDs running around on LV223 getting themselves munched and transformed in the process.  That's where the believability aspect falls apart.  I can't believe that a truck driver - let alone an expert scientist - would walk up to a living organism its never seen before - something looking like a king cobra without eyes, and start cooing to it and want to stick his finger in its mouth!  Who the 'ef' does that?  Seriously.

It's too bad, because I wanted so much to give this ride the full five stars, but I just can't.  i give it 3 so that I can say ""See It"" and enjoy the horror/haunted house story for what its worth.  But don't go looking for intelligent scientists who know what they're doing, cause these losers would be kicked out of the corps if they ever made it back home after this.  It is clear that at least one, if not two, more film(s) will carry us to the point where they end and the very first ""Alien"" begins.  I only hope that someone stops long enough to write some intellect into the characters as we move forward.  We're rooting for you, scriptwriters - try not to let us down, okay?!

Yet, the movie quickly degenerates into Rambo-like action.  Wind hurls our heroes around and mysterious aliens attack them, and they jump and shoot and cut and run and fight.  Tom and Jerry cartoons have deeper plots.

4780104,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus starts on a high note,  After the opening sequence with the Alien being left behind on earth to do his thing it starts a downward spiral and never looks up again.

The story plot is pathetic, the actions of the so called crew a joke considering the magnitude of the mission. Like the stupid geologist and his buddy would even come close to passing the psychic screening for such an endeavor..

And  Charlize Theron's  character tells the crew in no uncertain terms they will have no contact what so ever with any inhabitants to which the crew promptly hops in their vehicles and ride off like they are in a parade.  Please, This movie was a disaster.

All I see is a lame attempt for some kind of prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien series.  I guess after something like the original Alien there is no where to go but down..

I am giving it 3 stars only because I am a BIG Sci-Fi fan of the first order,

Very good special effects for what there was.  Not hardly good enough to make Prometheus a movie you would want to own..

It is not bad, really, in any way, but it has some small flaws in it that are hard for me to look past.  They might spoil the story for those that have not watched it, so I will not list them here, but they are significant enough to ding the movie one star in my mind.

As far as the good stuff?  Wow - amazing effects, and some stellar acting by Michael Fassbender.  Really a great example of how detail oriented Ridley Scott is when designing a movie, which makes me feel a little more strongly about the flaws.

4780421,4,B005LAIHY0,"""Without being familiar with Alien, the initial reaction I received at my first midnight screening for this film was well worth it. It is the kind of film that leaves the audience boggling with questions and it all works well than probably AvP (Alien v. Predator).

The acting was prime especially from Rapace and Fassbender. Even when some may view David as cold, it is all integral paying as a homage to HAL-9000 (2001) and his performance serves as a reminder of the future and its dependence of technology (no hints/spoiler but he is empty in one part). The somewhat minimal special effects, reasonable time length, Oscar-level cinematography, and scenery is phenomenal, better than Avatar (which ain't all that good/look over the Cameron hand-kissing hype) especially when considering everything is centrally located to one location (often touching on minimalist points than the extravagant and grand). The opening has an ethereal quality about it and its calming yet tense soundtrack all complements the mood of the film. The idea that it is a horror is quite contradictory to the film's particular core- the idea of space exploration and research into new life and signifies itself as a human futuristic thriller about the importance of ideas and peril in the face of scientific discovery. It follows along the lines of other great films, but not to the level of celebration by critics, like Moon (neat, cerebral film from David Bowie's son- Duncan Jones), The Island of Dr. Moreau, Pandorum (which is very similar), and Fantastic Planet (a classic but not-very-good animated fantasy.

In regards to particular criticisms, the story is grand but slightly choppy involving the man behind the spaceship that Charlize Theron finds is hostile as well as the troubling figure known as The Engineer who has a rather faint significance here beginning and ending. The film does lack a sense of a stronger foundation in the opening but is forgiven with the insight into discovery of a new planet and the R rating was particularly too high for the film's rather infrequent yet disturbing images and the film feels altogether tamer compared to many R-rated films and even PG-13 films like Casino Royale and Taken.

A newer notice is at stake with the many haters-and-lovers who view Prometheus in a mixed fashion. The film as a whole is more positive in terms of film criticism when you consider viewing it from a perspective that does not have much familiarity with the Alien franchise and/or science-fiction. Patience is best a virtue when viewing a film that is as contemplative and gradually tense as Prometheus. Give it a go, but like any film, come with an open mind!""",1353888000,2,2670,4.982062780269058

4780423,2,B005LAIHY0,"My problem with Prometheus is definitely not the star cast or the graphics. I don't think the storyline was horrible but it wasn't going anywhere. The acting is horrible and the direction even worse and towards the end if you compare with better Science Fiction films it looks very pretentious. The last half hour was quite bad because of how the story dives down and the submission to the aliens. The characters that were built up for destruction like a Cabin in the woods really had no purpose of attention in the first place. Some say this was a prequel to some other film and some say there is a sequel coming, the acting and directing was quite horrible I felt. Michael Fassbender who is usually a terrific actor was quite mediocre in this, there was no sync in his character from beginning to end even though...*insert spoiler* The director didn't seem to know whether to make a Jurassic Park out of this film, or whether to make a Planet of the Apes or whether to just make this film ""The Core"" and trying to do so many things at once proved a little unbecoming for the viewer. I could have used more films as pawns. I wish the story line was built up better and there was more answers than the viewers being left to believe what is best. I felt this miss film was made for the hit or miss generation. In the year where films like ""Tuckers and Dale v/s Evil"" are doing well, Prometheus will obviously do better.

I felt like the main bad guy (And the secondary bad guy) had to be the way he/she/it was because well... they needed a bad guy to do those things, or it wasn't a scary movie.

Additionally, I was a little disappointed to see a team of ""scientists"" and ""professionals"" making really bad rookie mistakes, and having really poor judgement which led to their demise.  I think its much more interesting (and sympathetic) to see intelligent, and really competent people struggle (and perhaps come to a bad end) because the antagonists where even more clever and competent.

All the Creator says is ""Why did you come here?"" and then it kills everyone for no particular reason? Are we to understand that our ""gods"" are vicious thugs who revile us for no reason? Did they create the Alien creatures to wipe us out? Why did they fail? What went wrong? None of those questions are answered. I wanted to like this movie.

4780754,4,B005LAIHY0,"If you are even close to being a fan of the ""Alien"" films, particularly the first one, you may enjoy this.  There's a lot of good and not so great features to this 4-Disc Collector's Edition.  The look of the film is pure Ridley Scott with the graphics, colors and moods.  One thing is certain.  Scott did not scrimp on sets, but the story could have been pulled together a bit better.  The story-line will satisfy an average film goer, but if you are into plot, you'll find a lot of holes here.  To add to that, there is NO ""Director's Cut"" of this film!  That's blasphemy!

The 3D special effects are, however, phenomenal. I saw the film is a theater and the effects are not overused and there are no blurry edge spots or gratuitous things flying in your face.  If you could simply see the scene where the universe is shown in 3D with see-through holograms slowly moving around each other, with a character is the center, you'd be amazed.  That in itself is worth the film.  But a home theater 3D system is very expensive.  Still it is worth it.

So what's in the box?

The first disc is the 3D version and as a collector, I like having it even though I know no one with a system that can play it.  There is no price difference between the collector's set.

The second disc is the actual film as it was shown in the theater.  It also includes the options of commentaries by Ridley Scott and the two writers, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.  They explain the manic writing force that drove them and how Scott took their vision and `corrected' it over and over.  They didn't seem to mind.  Here is an interesting quote:  ""That is very much in tune with the movie that Ridley wanted to make, which is, ""This is what happens when mankind is silly enough to think they can go and ask God questions."" First off, God might not necessarily be interested in answering you, but even worse than that, you might just set him off just for the act of trying"".

The Deleted and Alternate Scenes are what fill in the plot holes.  Ever wonder why Guy Pearce is only shown as an older Weyland?  There is a huge scene as a young man here that completely (almost) explains why this expedition took place.  It was not exactly the archeologist's idea alone.  The alternate beginning and endings really are simply extended versions of what you already see in the main film.  Scott's explanation for the plot holes and some of the placement of certain scenes was more for pacing the film than explaining the plot.  That's a tough trade-off.

You also get the film in English DTS 7.1, English Descriptive Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1 and subtitles in English and Spanish.

The third disc is more extras, including `The Making of Prometheus Documentary"", which is kind of fun to watch once.  There is also the Production Galleries and featurettes called the ""Weyland Corp. Archives"", which are extensive.

The fourth disc is your `digital copy' and the Standard Definition of the film.  There is also a ""Prometheus"" for Portable Media Players.

In summary, you could say that the film is gorgeous to look at (especially 3D), but the plot is pure Swiss-cheese, even with the extras that seem to pull the story together more.  There will be at least one more sequel to this prequel and probably more than that.  I'm happy I purchased it, as the price is right, but try not to be too picky.  Just enjoy it.",1353801600,4,3413,4.5

My review means little amongst all these others but if you have seem the Alien films you will have already seen scenes like the big storm on an alien planet with folks trying to get back to the ship; the huge alien vessel like the one that was crashed in Alien; the pods people shouldn't touch but do so anyway; a creature growing inside someone; the huge multi-wheeled transport vehicle; creatures puncturing the glass visors on the helmets; pretty much the same type of crew members; everyone popping out of their sleep chambers and having the first meal together; a ""hidden"" agenda on the purpose of the trip; someone trying to bring something they shouldn't aboard their ship; only one survives and it's a scantily clad woman; the decapitated head of a robot that can still speak; and the list goes on. Prometheus seems to have been made from the parts of others and other than the unimportant visual scenes added as a distraction there was very little new here and I actually regret having purchased this before ever seeing the movie. I'm selling my copy of this movie.",1353801600,2,1321,4.531380753138075
4780858,4,B005LAIHY0,"Like many folks I went to see Prometheus expecting an Alien prequel. I didn't read any pre-movie reviews because I didn't weant to see any spoilers. After seeing it I was left scratching my head. No, it really isn't an Alien prequel. Many other reviewers here have disected the film in great detail. I won't repeat what they've already written.

I will say that I enjoyed the movie more the second time I saw it. The Blu-ray has features that give a better explanation of what the film and Ridley Scott were trying to accomplish. It isn't bad Sci-Fi (like lots of Sci-Fi) it's just different. The Blu-ray wasn't crammed with superfluous extras, but enough to give you some additional flavor. I say it's worth a look.",1353801600,,716,4.637795275590551

4781342,1,B005LAIHY0,"*** WAY TOO MANY SPOILERS***

Visually, Prometheus is a stunner. The CGI and photography look fantastic; you get your money's worth in that regard.  The same can't be said for the script and characters, which are dumber than a bucket of dirt! Here's why:

1. Peter Weyland, who funds the expedition, appears at the beginning of the film via recorded video, introduces himself to the crew and reveals that, by the time they see this, he would be dead. Near the end of the film, he re-appears, but in human form. In the ship. Right there. In the ship. The question arises: Why the hell would Weyland appear to be dead, hide in his own bloody ship - HIS OWN SHIP!! - then casually re-appear an hour or so later in the movie to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age?

2. Before heading out on their mission, Shaw informs Jackson, expedition SECURITY, that this is a scientific expedition and that no weapons are allowed. Why was Jackson included for the mission then? If he's not allowed to carry weapons, how will he defend the team in case real trouble arises on an alien planet on which no humans have ever set foot? What's he going to use? Karate? The Judo chop?

3. Fifield's tantrum upon finding the first dead alien. Why would Weyland choose a wimpy geologist - who just ""loves rocks"" - for an enormously expensive and potentially dangerous expedition to an alien planet gazillion miles from earth?  Surely the suitable candidate for such a mission should be robust and prepared for any sort of emergency, including finding dead weird stuff he's never seen before! But instead, Fifield scampers off back to the ship, taking scared-stiff biologist Millburn along with him! Where did Weyland find these wimps?

4. Why is David, the programmed and therefore supposedly obedient and smart android so ill-disciplined? He opens alien doors without asking permission (""oops, sorry""), he touches the stone cylinders without thinking (""sorry""), he inexplicably and intentionally poisons Holloway with the black liquid (not sorry, I presume). Why doesn't he test the stuff in a lab first? He's android gone wild! And yet, towards the end he helpfully and sincerely assists Shaw to find another ship! How touching. Aw[...]

5. Before the storm arrives, why do Millburn and Fifield wander around aimlessly in the caves? They're lost, see. And they're smart, too. They're scientists. Why then, don't they ask help from Prometheus who could EASILY guide them back to the ship via the mapping system which, only recently, had mapped out the entire cave?!

6. Fifield and Millburn are scared of dead aliens. Apparently, Millburn is not scared of live alien snakes. What does he do when he's confronted by a threatening alien snake? He pets it of course. Fifield just stands by. And watches. Why not? Makes perfect sense. The snake then kills Millburn. Even better.

7. With the help of a medicinal apparatus, Shaw performs abdominal surgery on herself to remove an alien host - a squid.  Shortly after, she stumbles into a room filled with crew members. Nobody notices her exposed stomach with surgery staples the size of door handles. Nobody bothers to ask her: ""Excuse me, but WTF happened to you?"" Nobody. Amazing huh? What's more remarkable is that a mere few hours later she dashes around like an Olympic athlete, trying to get away from a ship, completely pain-free and mobile. Oh yes.

8. Why doesn't Holloway raise the alarm when he realizes he's infected by some weird bug that's crawling around in his eye? You know, have it looked at in the lab by his fellow SCIENTISTS? Seems like the smart thing to do, right? No. The smart thing would be to not tell a soul and become so ill that you REQUEST to be doused with fire and die a horrible, painful death. But of course!

9. Why does Shaw, who remains a professional for the most part of the film, suddenly act like a petulant child towards the end when the group and Weyland confront the Engineer? Why yell and scream like an irritable toddler at the Engineer? Doesn't make one bit of sense.

10. Shaw convinces Janek to ram himself, his two pilots and all of Prometheus into the Engineer's craft. It takes her only a few seconds to persuade three other human beings to give up their lives by turning their spacecraft into a giant fireball. And they happily oblige. Just like that. No questions. No discussions. Really? REALLY?!?!?!

11. When Shaw and Vickers run from the falling alien spacecraft, why do they run in a straight line? It's obvious to everyone and their mother that, if you just turn right or left, just by a few meters, that you'll avoid the craft and save your life. But noooooooo. Eventually Shaw realizes this. Not Vickers. Turns out she's not only a bitch, but a stupid one, too.

See? If you break it down, this movie is just unbelievably f***ing stupid. Roger Ebert awarded this film four stars. Ironic, since he's always been an ardent crusader for films with intelligent scripts and characters.  Strangely, I do recommend this film. Grab your popcorn and soda, but DON'T switch your brain on.  Unfortunately nobody told me. But now I can tell YOU, you lucky devils!",1353715200,91,5150,4.748040313549832

Just one of the many scenes that will leave you wondering what the scriptwriters were on when they wrote this.

Like why don't they make a sequel to this movie where they explore what happens when our heroine gets to the home planet in one of their ships and demands to know why they wanted to exterminate the human race. Of course given our current planetary consciousness or lack there of,its no stretch to see that we still have a long way to go,before we are ready to deal with other species from other parts of the universe. As for the movie,it was visually captivating and engrossing from start to finish. It could have been longer and I would not have noticed, I was so fascinated with the interiors and set design's and wondering what a lot of it was used for in my imagination.

Big fan of Idris Elba or as my daughter and I like to call him the first black James Bond, if Daniel Craig retires.  That's if the Bond family has the balls to do it.  I like that this movie has some humor thrown in the right spots.  Some of the reviews said that this movie is hard to understand.  Not sure what these people were talking about.

The only drawback, not just for this film, is the expensive price most studios charge for the 3 pack.  You pay for the movie, not the format it is delivered in, at least not for DVD and digital as the material costs are insignificant (when compared to blu-ray blank discs), and their 3 in 1 is a ploy to excuse why they charge so much more.  I don't use DVD, since I use my PS3, so why would I and I hate having to download extra software, flixter or itunes, to view my digital media.

I will not spoil the films homage and will leave it to the viewer to discover for yourselves.  This film I'd say has a more deft touch than films done by Cameron's Aliens film.  Ridley Scott I think is a true grown up story teller.  There is not gobs of F bombs and the film develops with a sure steady hand.  This is not an over the top SciFi but rather one that I think will be even more regarded as time passes.

The story, while basically a prequel to the Alien movies, is so full of illogical behavior by the characters in order to move along it is pathetic. You can see the nuggets of a good sci-fi tale here and there but eventually the movie is beat to death by an unrelenting bunch of smart people doing stupid things and getting killed by their idiocy. The 'oh duh' moments go on and on until all you can do is watch and wonder what the next blockhead is going to say or do. You have to wonder how it was released like this. Its really too bad.

4782171,3,B005LAIHY0,"I was really looking forward to PROMETHEUS last summer, but I wasn't able to get to a theater to see it. I had to wait until the film came out on DVD.  It finally did, but, of course, the studios have figured out that they can make more money if they don't put any ""Making of..."" features on the standard DVD but only on the Blue-Ray DVDs. So, while I would normally only buy a standard DVD, I've had to buy the Blue-Ray combos to get those features (on films like ""Super 8"" and ""Hugo"" as well).

Ridley Scott has long been my favorite director, going way back to the ""Duelists"" and, of course, ""Alien.""  I had heard the rumors that ""Prometheus"" was an alien prequel, so I was anxious to see it. Unfortunately, I found the story a bit confusing and underwhelming.  I would have liked more backstory on the aliens and what they were doing on that moon.  I felt some of the characters lacked the depth and humanity of the the first ""Alien"" movie.  Production wise, Ridley was in top form.  And, of course, the SPFX were the best you could have.  But it all came down to a muddled story. I loved the set up, but I felt there wasn't enough follow through on the mystery of how these alien signs/symbols ended up on different parts of the earth.  Maybe I'll like ""Prometheus"" more after a second screening, maybe it will make more sense, but I doubt it.  It is still a film well worth watching and pondering, just don't expect an ""Alien"" experience.",1353456000,2,1444,4.354477611940299
4782172,1,B005LAIHY0,"I am NOT going to say this film is leading to the decline of our culture, I will leave that for Twilight and the like, but this film has a really weak script and dialogue and emotional sequences that just don't fit in AT ALL. It's pretty ****ing hard to believe this guy was involved with something like Alien or Blade Runner in particular. The latter film being one of the greatest films of all time in my book and Alien not far behind. This one.... well it certainly had the chance to be completely awesome and it just comes across like some high-budget made for TV film.

WHY can they no get competent script writers and people to tell these guys this stuff resembles really weak storytelling and acting. As others have pointed out the incompetence of this high-tech culture is a little unbelievable and the situations they find themselves in are just a little too much to bear. It is well shot and the settings are very cool I just wish more talent and taste were put into the film. At the point one guy addresses an alien snake creature with, ""Hey baby, Hey baby,"" I almost had to call it quits. That is about all you need to know. I am willing to say at this point that Ridley's late brother's films are quite underrated, many of them with great scripts to be honest, compared to the blockbuster flicks the elder is putting out. I mean, you find an alien creature and the thing looks horrifying and is staring at you as it slithers up from a pool... and you sit there addressing it with that? Really? How about when the captain asks Charlize if she is a robot and then they go sleep together as she proves she is not one or something? WTF?

Seriously, Roomi and the lead male are TOTALLY miscast. Just insane how bad they are this film. Pretty much ruins it for me. Your mileage may differ but Roomi is by far the worst here looking like someone totally different from the love interest the male would truly be into. Her lines are cold and without much emotion at all. Beyond that it doesn't get much better. People just walk around and into trouble looking scared, dumb, interested, mysterious, and a whole lot of them like to push fancy buttons.",1353456000,7,2153,4.407035175879397

This time he shows up as the two bumbling fools, the guys who do everything wrong and defy all logic. One guy is basically Begbie from Trainspotting, looks kinda like him, sounds kinda like him, and acts kinda like him. Who takes psychopaths on the most important mission ever? Ridley Scott, apparently. Then you have the bigger idiot, who is basically Skipper from Sex and the City, goofy, naive, etc.
I propose that someone edit this movie removing every moment of these guys on screen. I am sure we'll at least have a better movie. Everything they are involved in is a subplot at best and does not really affect the shit hitting the fan. Even if it does, a little mystery could go a long way. I might be able to forgive the ""daddy doesn't love me"" stuff and the ""really?"" tacked-on ending...

4782234,2,B005LAIHY0,"I went to see this movie in the theater. As a fan of Scott, Fassbender and the Alien series I was very much looking forward to this movie. I left the theater in a daze. It looked amazing, enchanting, so dazzling in fact that I at first thought, ""I guess I just didn't pick up on all the subtle clues that would've made the story make sense."" I spoke to friends and discussed that maybe all these questions would be answered in the sequel or in a extended cut Blu-Ray, but as time went by and the special effects and CGI wore off I grew more resentful. A question answering sequel, that's just lazy storytelling. A extended cut, that would be admitting you screwed up the actual movie. I couldn't make sense of the plot, the characters, or why the film purposely avoided any payoff. I came to the realization that I wasn't stupid, the movie was. There is some stuff in it that I like and the money shows on the screen, but why put so much effort, effects, and great actors into a movie when you don't have a coherent story or believable characters? I give Ridley Scott more credit then this so my only conclusion is that he must not have gotten a chance to see the film before it's release. There are just too many inarguably stupid scenes. (see other reviews) From now on, for me, this film will be the poster child of bad writing. When I heard the same writer is working on World War Z, a Max Brooks book I loved, I was crestfallen. So much potential wasted. A beautiful film built on a garbage script. I could debate this movie forever, but it's not worth it and besides I found this video that hilariously summed up all my arguments and more.

4782242,3,B005LAIHY0,"This prelude to the beloved ""Alien"" franchise series had been in preproduction since the early 2000s. The idea was to do an origin tale of how the horrible creatures came into existence.

Tale focuses upon a science team researching early civilizations which leads them to another planet where human beings were possibly created. It begins with clues and mysteries and then leads to violence, action and especially horror. I found the characters all over the board in quality though nobody was below average.

I suspect the biggest problem was that the cast was too big for the plotting but I wonder if Scott will come out with an extended edition and then the movie will be better with the extra 30-60 minutes. Time will tell. This is a movie that you see more for the visuals than one in which you appreciate the tale or the awesome characters.

Starring a number of known actors/actresses: Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba and Noomi Rapace.

As of August 2012 Fox is in the works for a sequel. The budget for this picture was $130M and it made over $402M at the Box Office.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid November 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.

SPOILER: some of the scientists were idiots like the dudes who let the coils wrap around them and tried to baby talk it. They must have been the intern dropouts. Heh. There were other moves that seemed like idiot scientist moves, too.

Okay so the alien shows up at the very end but don't you think there would have been more tension if the aliens had shown up at the very end in some capacity?

There are hours upon hours of documentaries, artwork, deleted scenes, etc.  The deleted scenes alone are truly special.  They really help flesh out more details of the story.  I think I actually preferred the alternate Fifield attack sequence shown on the Blu-ray to the actual theatrical cut.

This Blu-ray teased ""Questions Will Be Answered"" in its marketing campaign, and yes, the are.  I have no complaints at all about this set.

That said, I imagine fans of sci-fi and the Aliens movies will be entertained and find this a worthy couple hours spent.",1353283200,,499,4.847058823529411
4782943,4,B005LAIHY0,"Finally watched Prometheus (Blu-Ray with DVD version).  The product... very nice all around, though I don't think I will try out the Ultra-Violet due to the issues I've read on that technology.  It was an inclusion that was not a selling point for me, so no big deal.

The movie:  Visuals and effects?  Incredible and satisfying, so nothing to fault there.  Character development?  Ok at best with Noomi and with the android, but silly and hokey at times inre to the rest of the crew.  Not too bad overall as this is an aggressive film where the action sequences that are shown and the build-up to them leaves little time for character development... so it ends up being rather laser chiseled in where it can.  The story?  Great premise, ambitious, but would be a better long novel instead of a 2 hour movie in the telling.  That being said, it is not too hard to see that this is the first of a trilogy unfolding, and not too difficult for the Alien/Sci-Fi Horror fan's mind to fill in.  You don't have to be the 'hardcore' Alien or Sci-Fi fan or purest to enjoy this movie, but go into it without constantly comparing it to the early Alien movie looking for pitfalls, nor go into it expecting (like the 'Thing' prequel to John Carpenter's the 'Thing' did pull off) that the end of this movie immediately leads in to the original 'Alien'.  There is still some evolution to go to get to that point, but this movie does waft of the essence of that evolution, and not too bad at all with subtle tie-ins to the Alien Universe that... in juxtiposed time... is yet to come.  Finally, the Horror?  Great!  Creepy!  New Creatures and even a Zombie!  I wonder if one of the creatures was an homage to the Lovecraft 'Cthulu'!  Yes, there is still a lot of the 'why do people always do the most illogical and against all common sense things' moments during the suspense, reminiscent of slasher movies everywhere... but all in all, with the pitfalls, the lapses, the holes, and other such things that people love to lambaste in reviews... I thought this movie was entertaining and satisfying for what it is... and can clearly see it as the first part of a longer story... or prequel... that will move us eventually forward... back to the Alien Universe we have come to know and love!

Four stars simply because, imho, Charlize and Guy Pierce were completely wasted on this film.  Their characters were weak... too weak for their presence.  I believe it would have been better to get Lance Henricksen to play Wheylan (why not, as he appears in the Alien Universe more than any other actor outside of Sigourney), and someone like Mimi Rogers or some other recognizable name to play the cold hearted company gal.  I believe NOT having their names in the cast and credits would NOT have slowed the ticket sales, nor made any difference to anything in this film if less 'screen presence' actors were used.  I really like both of them, but was especially disappointed in the character Charlize portrayed.

BTW... Noomi is NOT Lizbeth in this movie... but IS Elisabeth... and is nothing short of a Delight!!!",1353283200,2,3090,4.605118829981718
4782944,4,B005LAIHY0,"I purchased this edition of Prometheus because I wanted the bonus material. As a huge Alien fan, I very much enjoyed this movie in the theaters and wanted to get answers to my questions.  I liked the voice overs during the bonus material.  I even downloaded the Prometheus app to my phone and found it cool that I could interact with it from my phone.  My only complaint is why did I have to pay for the 3D and regular DVD versions?  I guess they now package all of this together to keep everyone happy, but if it adds to the bottom line for me, then I don't think that is very consumer friendly.  Maybe the company doesn't want to spend money on creating various versions or wants to include what you really want in this one.

4782946,3,B005LAIHY0,"Sometimes I walk into a movie with high hopes and I'm profoundly disappointed (Green Lantern) and sometimes I walk into movies with low expectations and am pleasantly surprised (X-Men: First Class), but every so often, I walk into a movie knowing exactly what to expect and the film delivers exactly that. Prometheus is one of those movies, but not in a good way. As a Ridley Scott fan, I expected this movie to have stunning visuals and in that, the film does not disappoint. The man is clearly a visual storyteller and all of his films (whether they be his duds or his best work) are always visually compelling. As an Alien franchise fan, I expected any continuation of the series (whether it's the original series, the AvP films or this tangent of a film) to subscribe to the law of diminishing returns and in that, this film meets that expectation fully. As a person who's learned to become wary of any project Damon Lindelof is involved in, this movie certainly proves its point as to why it's wise to check the fine print in the credits...

It's easy to find faults with the film (as several reviewers have already pointed out), but I feel like the most disappointing aspect of the film is that it portends to be a return to a classic sci-fi film that explores the bigger mysteries of life cocooned inside a thrilling space adventure. However, the film ultimately resigns itself to bringing up larger concepts and then never really exploring them. This is a film content to revel in quasi-philosophical wonderings without any real sort of point of view and, once again, we plumb the depths of the basic gist of Chariots of the Gods? without adding anything even remotely new to the concept (which is even sadder when you realize that they've even already explored this concept in the colossally dumb first AvP movie.) This is a movie trying very hard to be serious, but ending up as hokey as any other sci-fi film that takes itself way too seriously. As a result, this is a film that has style to spare, but barely any substance to speak of.

On this, I would point the finger at Lindelof. He did the same thing with the TV series Lost (bringing up questions without any answers and then casually trying to cop out by claiming the questions are bigger than the answers) and this is a 2-hour film version of that screenwriting conundrum with a lot of visual flair and an unsatisfying reason to exist. I didn't find the characters to be especially fleshed-out and I found the main plot points to be a little ham-handed. Some elements of the script feel like they were written by first-year philosophy students and other elements are simply winking at the Alien franchise. Ultimately, there's only one thing I found interesting in this movie and it's something that isn't even addressed in this film, but seems to be held over for a sequel (SPOILER ALERT - I thought it would be interesting to follow Noomi Rapace's character to the Engineer homeworld, but it looks like that won't happen until a sequel.) To me, it seems like this movie wants to be so much more than it is and it's frustrating to watch it struggle at the seams.

Of course, many reviewers have already pointed out the nonsensical antics of most of the characters: Yes, several characters in this movie do not make sense - whether doing things that do not make sense, existing for no apparent reason or vaguely being an archetype for a whole host of sci-fi cliches (never trust a robot... unless it's R2-D2... because he'll save your ass every time you do something idiotic.) A large number of these characters' motivations seem unbelievable, a few characters are incredibly unlikable, but most are played by actors and actresses you like in other things. I like Michael Fassbender, I like Charlize Theron, I like Idris Elba and I even like Noomi Rapace, but most of these talents are seriously wasted. Seriously, Idris Elba is more interesting in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and have you seen that film? That film's a wreck, but at least he's entertaining in it. Here... well, he's in it, but that's about all I can say. Same thing for Charlize Theron - you keep waiting for her character to pay off eventually, but it never does, so it begs the question: why is the character there? Some of the other characters are pointless, too, but you know that they're alien fodder, so they don't really matter. It's a shame that most of the main cast don't really matter either.

Like people who are fans of this film, I was fascinated by the Engineers themselves and wanted to know more about them, but the film isn't interested in exploring them for any length of time and, from what information we do get of them, they're mostly a parallel to humans themselves in other entries of this series (in that they fool around with things they couldn't possibly hope to understand and usually destroy themselves doing it.) Maybe this is the central conceit of the film: we're the Engineers, the Engineers are us... man, that's boring. It's one of the oldest chestnuts in the bag of sci-fi cliche - make up an alien race that's pretty much a mirror image of us and point out the irony in the dumb things that we do. I get it. It's been done. It's been done a lot. It gets old after awhile, but not as old as these other cliche chestnuts that Prometheus explores: 1.) Humans are so dumb, they couldn't have possibly evolved without the help of alien interference; 2.) Although they helped to create us, we will never really be on the same level as our alien benefactors, so whenever we try to reach towards the heavens, they will destroy us...; 3.) ...which is kind of a religious allegory that calls into question the very nature of faith itself. Are we all part of some sort of divine plan (alien or otherwise) or are we just fooling ourselves into thinking that we're more than the sum of our parts? These are heavy concepts, to be sure, but like I've said previously, they're concepts the film delights in bringing up, but never fully exploring (in fact, it reminds me slightly of Star Trek V, which tried to explore similar territory, but then suddenly remembered it was a Star Trek movie halfway through and threw in a bunch of Klingons and an alien pretending to be God to skirt around the issue.)

The bottom line is this: the Alien films seem to work best when they're either a straight-up horror-type film like the original Alien or a balls-to-the-wall action film like Aliens. Whenever it strays too far from either of these genres, it seems to fall flat and be mediocre at best. Prometheus might work better if it were removed from the Alien franchise and stood alone as its own work (which is something the film seems like it wants to do, but knows it'll gain an audience if you relate it to something audiences already liked, which really just results in a film without a coherent identity.) At the end of the day, it's more enjoyable than some of the entries into the franchise, but it won't be one that you'll necessarily return to as often (for me, I'm always down for watching Alien and Aliens, I'll reluctantly watch Alien 3 and pass over Alien: Resurrection without comment. AvP is its own thing and I don't know that I can ever fully integrate it into the Alien franchise as a whole.) Prometheus is a movie that I might get talked into watching again solely because the visuals are so stunning, so even though I don't care much for what is happening on screen, it sure looks beautiful. As for the casual viewer, I can only recommend it if you go in with the right amount of expectations. If you aren't expecting much, you will find it watchable. If you're expecting a lot, forget it, because you won't find it here.

It's interesting to note that in Greek mythology, Prometheus played a trick on Zeus, offering up two different sacrifices: one was a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in ""glistening fat"" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter and, like this movie, that's what we, as audiences, got: something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior...",1353196800,,8181,4.6503109882515545

4783071,2,B005LAIHY0,"(Possible Spoilers)

Starting in 1979 director Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"", ""Blade Runner"", ""American Gangster"") brought us a great and haunting sci-fi film known as ""Alien"", it took some set-up but there was plenty to like and the movie was a truly ground breaking experience and with the sequels in the coming years especially the follow up James Cameron directed ""Aliens"" this series is truly one of the heights of sci-fi film making.

In ""Prometheus"" Scott returns to the director's chair to give us this story about events that took place before the first ""Alien"", it opens with some alien creature ingesting something, getting sick, falling apart and falling down a waterfall, then we have two people in Scotland in 2089 finding some drawings that seem to point to the origins of humans being created. Now we cut to a ship named Prometheus with a large crew, one of them not quite human who knows a lot about the ship and how the crew should take care of themselves.

The crew arrives on a distant planet that seems capable of sustaining life, once they investigate they find giant stone faces and many things that seem to confirm that some form of life was here once. Well of course something is here and it begins to attack the crew person by person, so the rest of the film is the survivors trying to escape this planet and return home.

Some of the crew have ulterior motives, mainly for profit (would this be a peaceful expedition if money wasn't a motive?) and quite frankly there's not a lot of people to root for. The cast includes Charlize Theron (""Monster""), Noomi Rapace (""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""), Guy Pearce (""The Time Machine""), Idris Elba (""Obsessed"") and others, though no one really has a standout performance and just kinda go by the books.

One thing I give major credit to is the visual effects and locations as they are both top notch, there is some good atmosphere and a little creepiness at times but at its core its mainly quite a dull and uninspired flick. This prequel reminds me a lot of prequel of ""The Thing"", in that it had some decent parts but mainly felt unnecessary. Scott is a great director but he has directed some duds (""G.I. Jane"" and ""Robin Hood"" instantly come to mind, and while I didn't have great hope for this flick, ""Prometheus"" definitely isn't one of his better efforts. *1/2 out of 4 stars, simply for the special effects and sets.",1353196800,2,2389,4.665083135391924

A great cast with very good acting, but the print-to-screen left something to be desired. The visuals were perfect. I will not be dumping this one, but will not place it at the top of my ""to watch again soon"" list either.

Likewise BLADE RUNNER, in all its versions, has always struck me as a film that defined the canon of science fiction films.  Having sat through two hours of PROMETHEUS, which doesn't so much revisit ALIEN as reproduce in many cases precisely the same sequences contained in the earlier film, I really wondered why Scott bothered to make it at all.  Maybe he hoped to emulate what George Lucas had done with the STAR WARS canon, and produce three prequels to the original STAR WARS film; if that was the case, then I wish he wouldn't.  PROMETHEUS is resolutely un-entertaining by comparison with ALIEN; the performances are wooden, the technology nothing special; and the plot almost entirely copying the original ALIEN film.

Well, I'd *really* like to raise the story you pumped so many holes in from the dead, but I'm no necromancer. Or is it cinemancer in this case? Okay, I only have a few points to make:

1. What a Great Trailer!
I saw a trailer many months ago. That trailer made me say out loud: ""Now *that's* how you do a trailer!"" And then all I could do was get excited and hope the movie would be good. Well, now my hope has been killed. Why did you kill my hope, Prometheus? What did my hope do to you? Why did you leave it mangled on the side of the road and spray it with skunk funk??

2. What Great Special Effects!
Yes, if you like special effects, and will defend a movie with good special effects even if the characters contradict their own professions, motivations and the overall thrust of the story with their actions, then you might love Prometheus and rate it 4 stars or higher.  However, If you are not the aforementioned person and realize that this movie is not intended to be a madcap romp, or that Galaxy Quest had waaay tighter story and plot, then you may end up with a frown on your face. Frown on Face. F.O.F.

4783661,2,B005LAIHY0,"All I ask is that a movie make some sense.  Just some.  I want to feel like the writers and directors actually thought about it before filming it.

Well... that didn't happen in Prometheus.

Let's just skip ahead to when the humans enter the alien facility and find the black goo stuff.  So what exactly does the black goo do anyway?  Does it destroy your body?  Does it make your head explode?  I suppose it does because that's what happens to the alien head they discover it and thaw out.  But wait a minute... what about the astronaut geologist who falls on his face in the black goo after having his helmet melted?  Apparently, the black goo turns him into a super strong psychotic zombie or something.  One minute we think he is dead, the next he is running around like something out of The Walking Dead.  What's up with that?  How come to goo basically dissolves one person, but turns another into a zombie?

But wait... maybe it depends on the amount of black goo you are exposed to.  The android gives one of the humans a small drop of the black goo in a glass of booze.  Now you may be wondering why the android would do that... good question.  Perhaps an experiment or something.  Can't say for sure because it really isn't clear.  Anyway, in the case of one drop of black goo I guess it takes a day or so to have an effect on the victim.  The infected guy doesn't go haywire until maybe 24 hours have passed.  But that was enough time for him to get his woman pregnant... which is even weirder because I guess that the black goo infects your sperm or something.  The women gets pregnant with some freaky octopus looking alien thing.

Let's explore the alien octopus pregnancy for a minute.  When the android finds out, he tries to force the woman to carry the fetus to term.  Why?  Again, who knows.  Was the android trying to impregnate humans with alien fetuses?  I don't think so.  Did the android know that infecting the dude would also infect the dude's sperm and impregnate a woman with an alien fetus.  I don't think so.  Ok... so what is the android trying to accomplish?  I can't say really.

Well, the woman freaks of course and breaks into a special room on the ship which contains a surgical chamber like something you would see on Star Trek.  Wait a minute... how did she get in there?  Wasn't that area off limits?  Wasn't it locked or something?  Nevermind... so the woman gets in the surgery unit and has the alien octopus fetus cut from her womb.  She then gets stitched up and stumbles back out into the ship.

Question - how do people react when they see this nearly naked woman stumbling around with a big incision across her abdomen?  How do they react?  They don't react at all!  They are just like ""Hey... how's it going"" or something.  In fact, she somehow wanders into a room where the android and the gang are waking up the really old man who secretly funded the mission.  They don't react to her at all... even the android who knew she had been pregnant.  WTF?

Now the film gets really dumb.

The super old dude planned the whole trip because he wanted to meet these aliens.  Therefore, the android suits him up and they enter the alien facility in order to wake one from 2,000 years of hibernation.  The alien, of course, freaks on everyone, kills the old dude, and rips the android's head off.  Uhhhh.... Anyone else wondering why they didn't wake the alien guy up ahead of time?  Is there any particular reason why the old dude felt he needed to be standing right in front of the alien the minute they woke him up?  Didn't anyone think that a little caution was warranted?  After all, apparently the team had already figured out that this facility was an alien outpost for the production of a biological weapon (the captain just threw out that thought at random).  Apparently the android had already figured out that the ship was supposed to have traveled to Earth.  Ok then... so if you know all that, why are you sending a 100 year old man to stand right in front of the alien the minute you wake him up?  Does that make any sense at all?

To make a long story short - alien activates ship and attempts to take off.  We assume he is heading to Earth in order to destroy the human race with the biological weapon.  Therefore, the captain of the human team pilots the human spaceship into the alien spaceship and destroys them both - causing the alien ship to crash back to the surface.

I guess that the whole human kamikaze thing really ticked the alien dude off, so he comes out looking for the human woman - since she is the only person left alive.  He tracks her into the escape pod section of the ship (which is really a large apartment) and gets caught by the alien fetus that the woman cut out of her womb a few scenes earlier.  Except this isn't just a little octopus fetus anymore, now it is giant.  I'm kind of wondering how in the heck it got so big so fast.  I'll defer on the accelerated growth rate, but any idea what this thing was eating?  How do you get that big without eating something?  The fetus thing was locked in the medical room.  What did it eat in there? Ahhhh... nevermind....

Regardless... one dead alien dude later, the woman goes back into the alien spaceship in order to retrieve the android's decapitated head (which is still working).  Then, for some unknown reason, she decides they need to find another alien ship and travel to the alien home world.  I'm thinking... oh... maybe that makes sense... perhaps she wants to infect the alien home world with the biological weapon.  Ahhhh... no.  She says she wants to visit in order to ask them ""why"".  Why did they create humanity and why did they want to destroy it?

Dumb.  Let me get this straight.  You just blew up your own spaceship in order to prevent an alien ship from reaching Earth.  Now you decide it would be a good idea to travel to the alien home world to ask them questions?  Did you ever consider that this would be just drawing attention to yourself?

Also, what have the aliens been doing for the last 2,000 years?  Apparently the facility was 2,000 years old.  So if the aliens were trying to wipe out humanity, then why didn't they just send another ship?  Was this the only facility of its kind?  Even if it was, do they not have any other weapons?  What?  Was nuking Earth too complicated for them?  How about tossing an asteroid our way?  What's the deal?

Final thought.  The human scientists determine that the alien DNA is exactly the same as human DNA.  It is?  Have you seen the alien dude?  Does it look like he has identical DNA to you?  I mean... besides the fact that he is twice the size of a normal person, has black eyes, pasty skin, crazy muscles, etc.  Oh yeah... other than that we are identical!  Right.  We have more in common with a chimp than that alien dude.",1353024000,29,6828,4.3993584603047315

This movie is full to bursting of very good (and good looking) actors and actresses. Idris Elba, Noomi Rapace (who looks amazingly fit!), Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender and Logan-Michael Green are really always a joy to watch perform. I particularly enjoyed Idris Elba's kind of hayseed captain character, and the too brief scene near the end of the film with him and Noomi Rapace is one of my favorites.

The special effects and scene modelling are good.

There's some really decent action in this movie near the end.

The Not so good:
From a science perspective this movie was hilarious. I'll not rehash the premise as other reviewers have done. What struck me was that these were absolutely some of the silliest scientists you will ever see in a film. Here are some highlights:

*Spoilers*

Taking off your protective gear and breathing strange air on an alien planet you just arrived at
Hooking up a dead alien head (outside of a hood no less) with unidentified cells growing on it to electrical currents until it explodes
Deciding to settle down for the evening in the room filled with unidentified black viscous goo
Reaching your hand out to a hissing serpent like alien life form
 The angry geologist with the nifty mapping tools was the first one to get lost

* End Spoilers*

I know this isn't meant to be a comedy, but as someone who has worked in a variety of science fields (including environmental science), I laughed a lot. Just wow- everything a scientists is trained not to do they did.

Conclusion:
As an Alien series fan, this is still an entertaining watch. It's interesting enough to keep you on the hook for the next installment. Watch it, enjoy the good performances, the beautiful people, and just shake your head at the science.",1352937600,,1767,4.748366013071895
4783966,4,B005LAIHY0,"I was a bit surprised that a lot of folks who watched the preview to this movie were unable to determine that it's to do with the Alien universe. I find it even more surprising that throughout the entire movie, very little hint is given that the movie is actually a prequel to the Aliens movie other than indirect evidences. I'm not sure of the reason for this. Whether it's because of the fact that they can't say it belongs to Alien franchise (due to copyrights or whatever) or they don't want new audience viewers (Alien franchise is about 30 years old I think) to be misrepresented. Whatever the reason, the ""A word"" (known as Alien) is never mentioned anywhere in the film and not a single description was given that indicates it was part of the Alien world other than Ridley Scott directed it and that he directed Alien.

The movie itself is rather good. At the start, we learn that Weyland Yutani, the evil  faceless company from the Aliens movie, is spearheading a research vessel to reach a planet in a far off world in space. A surprising fact about Weyland is that it was never mentioned in the first Alien movie which was directed by Ridley Scott, so I was a bit surprised that he actually decided to use this name.

The reason for the space vessel is noble. Throughout earth, it appears there are many clues to point to a system of stars that isn't visible by the naked eye that many ancient cultures drew. It pinpoints that somehow an alien visitor must have told them about these star systems. So Weyland decided to build a ship, hire these scientists, and attempt to make contact with this far off world not knowing if anything is there or if they'll make it back.

The movie tries to make battle between a lot of things and I think at some point it sort of falls apart. The first attempt is to try and settle the argument between science and religion. Throughout the movie, the main theme is to find the origins of earth life through these ancient aliens the characters refer to as the ""creators."" The main character Elizabeth has a cross that she got from her father who died when she was young. Her mother also died early. So Elizabeth is left without family and on top of that, as a cruel joke, Elizabeth also can't have children so she's doomed to always try and find the answer to life yet at the same time she'll never be able to pass the knowledge. So with this in mind, Elizabeth is at great conflicts, she wants to find answers but she also wants to believe that there is something more than just this physical world. Many other characters try to battle this out with Elizabeth and try to say, ""Why do you believe in god and yet know that these 'creators' are indeed your god?"" And Elizabeth answer is, ""What created the creator?"" That is the entire basis of it and it's corny as anything.

The movie itself taken a very different turn from the Aliens universe. The aliens movies, at least the first two, were about discovering a new life form that happens to be hostile. It was aimed at scaring people and on top of that produce a great movie about battling aliens and surviving. The movie Prometheus was suppose to be a prequel to explain where the aliens originated from. In the first Alien film, when the crew landed on LV426 discovered a crashed alien ship infested with what appears to be egg capsules and the lone humanoid pilot (that is much larger than a normal person) appearing to suffer a massive explosion from inside his abdomen. So the question by many fans was where did the ship come from? Who was in the ship? And that was what this movie, Prometheus was supposedly suppose to answer.

So how did this film compare to the Aliens world? Does it answer the question that everyone had after watching the first Alien movie? The answer is no, in my opinion. The movie tries to make it that these ""creators"" created some biological weapon against humans. The star map that the creators told the humans was actually a biological weapon storage planet that house some biological weapon that can destroy humans and on top of that evolve to any shape and form. It turns out that the ship in the first Alien movie was actually a biological weapons vessel that house very dangerous weapons. So the movie begs more questions than answers. Why the creators decide to give humans a starmap to their destruction? Could they be upset that their creation can travel space? Or what if the creators never actually created life on earth and just gave the starmap in case life ever evolved too far? It doesn't make sense and I think this film Prometheus is indeed a prequel to another film.

Overall I didn't like it. To say the aliens were actually evolved biological weapons might fit into the aliens world since in both films the ""company"" (aka Weyland Yutani) was interested in the Aliens for biological weapons. It appears in the first film, the company actually knew about the alien vessel and wanted to have it at all cost knowing that a hostile life form was on it but gave little explanation. So it was almost like the company was searching for that and never really knew where the planet Prometheus went to (or maybe it was destroyed which might be explained in Prometheus 2).

Whatever it is, the movie was rather interesting but it fell apart in some areas. I found it to be a very visually pleasing movie. Elizabeth Shaw was a very fitting character for the film. There were some silly parts of the film but as a whole, the movie is okay and I liked it. I recommend to all Aliens fans out there.",1352937600,,5530,4.500996015936255
4783967,4,B005LAIHY0,"I watched the Alien original before I rented this because of the advertisement linking the two movies.  Who can forget the Alien after you've enjoyed that oldie but goodie.  Then I rented the video on Amazon - why buy when you can rent, eh?  I liked this movie so much I then bought the blue-ray.

The movie, I give five stars.  I am looking forward to the sequels that are sure to follow.  Fantastic story line, great effects and the effects dont' overwhelm.  The acting is awesome - even the side cast did a fantastic job with believable characters.  So much so that you can't tell who the main players are for quite a while - and the twist at the end made me go ""wow!""

The Blue ray menu system on this particular set is my only complaint.  It requires a huge amount of memory and if you don't have aux memory on your blue ray player, you will get an error message - then you can watch the movie.  Without the menu system, though, you cannot watch the extras which are pretty good.  To give perspective, I never watch the extras typically, and a movie has to be fantastic for me to bother.

My one complaint about the deleted/alternative and extended scenes is you cannot watch the movie with those add-ins so you can see the impact on the story.  Since they were all batched together, I couldn't really even pick out the alternative paths and wasn't able to figure out what was diffent as far as an alternative ending goes.

So if you want a fantastic movie, like sci-fi and want to see what turns out to be a stretch-of-a-prequel to Alien, rent the movie.  If you want to own it like I did after watching it, look for a better packaging that gives you the ability to select rewatching the movie with the alternates in line.

4783970,4,B005LAIHY0,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I was unable to see it in the theater so had to wait for the release on DVD. The movie had not received the best ratings but I was still excited to see the movie for myself. I wanted to see what Ridley Scott had been able to put together as a type of ""prequel"" to the Alien movies.
After watching the film, I would rate it  a 7.5 out of 10 - I wanted it to be better.

I felt like there was so much of a story to tell that the movie was edited down too much - maybe would have been better to release in 2 movies or made a longer film. The action/suspense part of the movie was alright, although I didn't have any ""jump out of my seat"" moments I was expecting.

I watched through some of the extras including the deleted and alternate scenes. Two of the deleted scenes should have been left in the movie to help tell the story or at least tie it together a little better.
I felt like the characters in the movie all of a sudden came to a conclusion on the true meaning of what was going on without really explaining how they came to that conclusion. One of the deleted scenes filled in the holes of the characters thought process.

Overall, I liked the movie and would recommend it as a movie that you should buy or at least rent.

4783971,5,B005LAIHY0,"Taking all of the side shows going on regarding 12-12-2012, the discoveries being made by NASA and worldwide scientists of dozens of new planets per week, combined with historical archives dating back 35,000 years all the way to 5000 b.c., which to this day cannot be logically explained, Ridley Scott weaves together a broad spectrum of public discourse into an incredibly beautiful tapestry, especially in the BluRay 1080i version. It dares press the boundaries of both scientific and metaphysical discourse, or more precisely, at the point where these two view points diverge from the logical to the probable.

Those who watch this movie, with a curious intellect, an open mind and a curious heart about what was, what is, and what will be should find this movie to be extraordinarily imaginative and a great experience both visually as well as spiritually. It makes one look within and at humanity as a whole and consider the destructively primitive side of man, and where it comes from, why it exists, and what all the underground talk about ""Nibiru"" and the Giants that once visited earth the last time Planet Nibiru orbited earth 5000 years ago, the  surge in UFO sightings, Project ""Disclosure"" involving hundreds of the brightest minds on earth who want to ""tell the truth to the public"", the stories we see in SGU, BSG and the old Kubrick films.

It borders on creating a unifying theory for both scientists and those who believe in the existence of an intelligent design, not exactly ""God"" by any stretch of the imagination, but definitely plays off the question of how we ended up on earth, who created us and why, and is there a reason we are destined to self-destruct as a race, either by self-perpetuated disasters, war, or some other event that even in other 5 star rated Sci-Fi is referred to as ""The Cycle of Time"", meaning ""What Once Was Shall Be Again"". Has the human race been wiped out before and restarted, how many times has this cycle played out? Is the repetitive story as told by Abraham, and Zarathustra before him, and Moses, and Christ, and Mohammad centuries later a regurgitation of the same story or perhaps a depiction of the same event repeating itself between Zoroaster, the first monotheistic Prophet to Mohammad the last of the Monotheistic prophets?

Unless you're an intellectual, you're probably going to rank this movie with 1 star as some of the semi-literate reviews I've read. If you're of the curious type with a high propensity to absorb information like a sponge no matter when and where you come across it, you'll see the delicate weaving of multiple story lines over vast stretches of history, archeological discoveries, anthropological realizations, geological as well as cosmological discoveries on and off earth, all of which has accelerated at a blazing speed over the past decade, making it difficult to not only keep up, but to step back and look at everything from a ""God's Eye View"" to make sense of it all in a single context.

What Ridley Scott has done in this film is exactly that. He's taken all of the sub-plots of the 2012 prophecy, the Mayan 5000 year cycle, the cave drawings discovered which range from 35,000 to 5000 years old, depicting almost identical imagery, the idea that the pyramids were massive energy reactors of the ancients, and the concept that there's something out there which we have yet to discover that will predate humanity and perhaps prove that we are children of a more advanced civilization who genetically manipulated their own DNA with that of Darwinian evolution at the point where Darwin falls off the proverbial cliff when a massive gap appears in his timeline of evolution.

The point is this movie is ""Science FICTION"". The brilliance of Ridley Scott shines in his ability to harmonize all these widely held assumptions and ideas about man, where we came from, why we exist, where we're headed, why we probably won't survive because of our destructive nature which appears so primitive the more you engage in BSG, SGU, and this movie.

All in all, it is by far one of the most important films to have ever been made, especially in 2012, and there's a grainy, auditory vibe to it which reminds me of 2010 and ""HAL"". Mark my words, this movie will become more important in the coming decades than any Orwellian films, or the Kubrick Space Odyssey films, and both made tremendous scientific, philosophical and cosmological leaps of faith that today we still view them in awe and study them in the highest academic institutions.

Prometheus will be at the top of that list as it begs many questions to be answered and pondered upon, which is precisely the objective of Science Fiction, which to be valid, must be based on theoretical scientific assumptions that are still in the same infant stages as many of the aspects of Special Relativity and Quantum Physics. Like the most recent confirmation of actually observing a Bose Higgins Particle, (aka the God Particle).

The best part was the cost of the voyage, invested by a fictitious private company which if you watch until the end of the credits, you'll be surprised by something unexpected.

Regardless of the half-literate, peanut IQ's of those who bash this brilliant film, any of you with intellectual curiosity will be amazed at this movie, especially if you allow the beauty of it to come out via BluRay in 1080i using a home theater. If nothing else, it's a visually dazzling film that ranks with Avatar and even resembles some of the ""secret NASA footage"" leaked on YouTube about possible UFO's checking out the space shuttles on their missions over the past 20 years. Especially the shape of the object near the end of the film. (I'm trying to prevent spoiling the end). Just watch it, you'll be pleased.",1352937600,,5763,4.835699797160244

4783973,5,B005LAIHY0,"VERY IMPORTANT INFO FOR BLU-RAY USERS:

If you intend to play this disc on a PS3/Blu-Ray player, you must make sure to update the firmware of your player. In my case, I was using a PS3 - which Sony has always maintained as a very capable Blu-Ray disc player - and when I first inserted the disc, the player booted the disc, but after a warning or two, did not move past a black screen.

To some, this may immediately be written off as a defective disc and be sent back together with a negative review. THIS IS NOT THE CASE.

The Prometheus Blu-Ray release comes at a time when a specific firmware update for the PS3 (and possibly for other players) was released, and if you are not in the habit of regularly updating your firmware (whether you're just lax or do not connect to the internet with your player/PS3) your player will not be able to play the disc. The player however, DOES NOT INDICATE A FIRMWARE UPDATE REQUIREMENT, so it's important that you try to update the machine if your disc does not work. This is not a difficult process, since there are instructions posted online, and the machine's interface may also have an update option that's easy to follow & activate.

If after updating your disc STILL does not work, then you may have a problem with the disc.

I hope this helps! Overall, once you have everything up and running, this movie is incredibly gripping to watch at home on your HD setup!",1352937600,,1410,4.449612403100775

4784076,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is actually a prequel to ""Alien"" no matter how they play it. Ridley did a great job and I understand a lot of questions are answered in the Blu-Ray Disc. This is not Planet 426 (Alien) but seems almost the same. Silica storms, alien ships, chest bursting.

I would recommend this to any fan of the ""Alien"" series, although you can see this without ever seeing an ""Alien"" film and still understand the film. Ridley Scott did a great job on making this film since it's been so long since he's done a sc-fi/horror film.

He says he planned on doing a sequel to Prometheus, however long that may be is unsure since he recently lost his brother to suicide and he's getting up there in age. It's tragic that he lost his brother and I wish him the best.

If you want to buy this set, get the Blu-Ray 3D/2D, DVD, wi-fi disc. It's been as low as $20.00 this past week. The only lousy thing about this set is that the 16 page book included in the set is lifted word from word from the ""Prometheus"" hardback book on the film that was released earlier this year. (And if you can still get that book, it's great and Ridley said it would be the only book done for the movie (unlike the Alien films).

4784079,2,B005LAIHY0,"I was really looking forward to seeing Prometheus because i heard it was a pre-quel to the movie Alien. On the front of the box it says ""Questions will be answered!"". Well after watching the film all i could say was ""what the heck just happened?"" Almost all of my questions about the genesis of the Alien were left unanswered and the film just made me have more questions then before i saw it. What i took away from Prometheus was that the Alien is a mutated biological/geneoligical weapon of some sort created by the ""Engineers""(as they are called in the film)which are the race of alien that piloted the spaceship in the film Alien. At the end of the film you see a creature that looks somewhat like the aliens from the other films. But how this Alien came to be is a bit strange and makes no sense to me. If you watch the film i believe you'll say the same thing. All in all the rest of the film was boring. Even if you don't associate this film with the Alien franchise, none of the major plot points in the film came to a conclusion.

  I don't know what Ridley Scott was thinking when he made this film and I don't understand what the writers were trying to accomplish either. It felt like an incomplete movie to me. I'm really disapponted that Scotts name is attached to this film because i really enjoyed many of his other films. If somebody is dumb enough to make a sequel to this film (it was set up for it) i hope they write a better story and execute it better.

I headed online to figure out what was going on and how all this was supposed to piece together.  If this was intended to be a multi-movie release then I can understand it being left so wide open.  If not and this was meant to be a stand-alone movie, I would have rated it a 2 star.

Again, you are left in the end asking, ""Why, why this, why that, how come, what happens,...?"" etc. etc.  This is one of those movies I wish I had either not watched or waited until the whole box set comes out.  After the online research, I found that no one really knows what the director meant to convey and it is all just conjecture at this point until a follow-up movie is released.  Even then, the movie had so many questions that it may end up like ""Star Wars"" in that movie I and II are just filler leading up to III.

Visually it looks pretty and the CGI stuff is generally good(it should be, the movie cost over 100 million to make), but as we all know pretty effects can't carry a movie.  This is supposed to be a prequel to Alien but in many ways it isn't.  Most of you will be left scratching your heads as to where in time this is supposed to take place.  Are they on the same planet that the first crew landed on in the first Alien?  In that movie the alien craft had thousands of eggs presumably carrying the face huggers.  In this film the ship had these canisters containing some form of contaminant or other.  It's never really explained.  Much isn't clear in this mess.  Here we have snake like things then an octopoid thing.  What are they? Dunno.  What made the original Alien so cool was the humans stumbling on a planetoid where a derelict craft had crashed, piloted by some unknown species.  In Prometheus that idea is being killed by somehow bringing humans into the mix by saying that that unknown species is really our creators.  That is that they are genetically linked to us thus taking the exotic feel of Alien 1 out of the equation.  To me that is a cop-out bit of writing and whoever green-lighted the idea is an idiot.

The streaming was flawless with HD picture quality consistant.  I was sitting 8 feet from an 8 foot screen and it looked great from start to finish.

The characters on the ship were really too untrained and stupid to be in the jobs they were in. All of this is sort of typical of most big budget movies now.

Trying to avoid spoilers here so I'll just say that a lot of things happen to a woman and she perseveres unbelievably.  That was just over the top for me.  It was more like a parody of Sigourney Weaver's performance in Alien than anything else.  I found it reminiscent of the Monty Python skit with King Arthur and the Black Knight, where the Black Knight keeps on fighting while ignoring the fact that all his limbs are cut off.  I guess I still found it entertaining and worth the rental fee, but just barely.  If I had paid to see it in a theater I would have been very disappointed.",1352764800,,903,4.359281437125748

We thought this would give us a good base to watch this one letting it answer all our questions on where the aliens actually originated from.  A bit of a waste of time as watching this movie actually gave us more questions than answers.  Is there going to be another one?  As, in my opinion there needs to be to fill the gap where this movie ended and the original Alien movie started.

Stand alone it was quite a good watch.  Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander from the original foreign language Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) is a good actress.  She does need to work on her British accent as she started the movie herself (and the child version of her) with a very broad, posh English accent but ended up speaking in accented English, a small criticism but one that can ruin a great movie for me.

Guy Pearce is another favourite actor of mine but he just didn't work very well in his role in this movie.  He was obviously a young man trying to play an old man.  Just no need for that given the number of great older actors out there that would have fitted the bill so well.

Like I said, so many more questions which let the movie down but I won't list them here as they are spoilers for the story.

As most of you out there know; Prometheus is, actually, a prequel of sorts to the Alien movies. While the story precedes the events of the first Alien film, it's not directly related to the series. It takes place in the same universe, so to speak, but explores its' own storyline.

Those are movies where that level of lazy writing can be accepted under the fun of camp and too much blood. Some like it, some don't.

The stories are mutually contradictory and not even the final version can be seen as unmotivated by factors of ego and face and profit.

Mission Epilogue (2094)

Top Secret:Government Communiqu:
codenamed: The Creators.

The unfortunate incident that took place on the Starship Prometheus has been brought to the attention of the Interplanetary Council on Security. Prometheus, whose mission, privately funded by Weyland Corp, proposed the exploration of distant Moon Sector LV-223 for the examination of possible alien life forms.

This Report has been commissioned by secrets act #5287 to thoroughly investigate and determine the reasons for the loss of the crew, failure of the mission and any or all possible threats to long-term security by the actions of this lost venture.

The Weyland Corporation, having been the sole backer of said mission- took upon themselves all responsibility and liabilities without seeking government assistance for it's success and oversight- which- although very unusual for such a high priority mission was due to the powerful Lobbying efforts of Weyland Corp and it's overdue influence on certain unnamed individuals of the Interplanetary Council.

It has been known for some years, internally, that Weyland Corp has had general unrest within it's Executive Board of Trustees- Headed by the Factious Element, Meredith Vickers - Who used her close ties with the Senior allied members to place herself as head of the exploratory mission. With written confessions by collaborating engineers and computer scientists among her personal staff, she preplanned a catastrophic failure of this mission to duly disgrace her peers and the 1 Trillion Dollar expenditure; to exploit stockholders deep concerns; to rest final control of the board membership by dooming a venture which was headed and approved by CEO of Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland.

Her plan in detail:
-The shifting of funds that were meant to go into the building and design of efficient offense and defensive weapon systems that would counter all potential, reasoned and imagined dangers to the safety of the crew and threaten their safe return.

-Diverting Funds to Build and install a `State of the Art' escape craft into the design of the ship Prometheus to safe guard her interests instead, and be at her own ready disposable.

-Diverting Funds to bribe military personal into acquiring a biological virus that was engineered to effect enemy competence and turn them into regressive personality types on the battlefield, thus inhibiting the enemies ability to organize and fight among themselves. To be administered covertly to the crew members after initiating standard interspace hibernation procedures.

-Diverting funds to pay staff computer scientists to build a programming virus to infect the sub systems of `DAVID' the team robot.

A. To subvert the success of said mission at all times while not risking the life of Vickers.

B. To appear informative and helpful, while actually preventing successful conclusions to be drawn, or to be elusive if confronted directly.

C. To ensure that Earth and Weyland Corp. and it's Board of Trustee's not be exposed to an Alien threat that maybe initiated upon landing and to destroy or divert Alien threats away from Earth at all times-THIS PRIORITY TO OVERRIDE ALL OTHERS

-To Direct the Personal Department to sort all applications for mission personal in order of experience and competence in each specialized field, and that only Vickers was to have access to mission personal files. From which she choose the following team members:

1. Dysfunctional Ships Captain, Janek , whose prior interplanetary experience consisted of 20 years piloting a supply barge from Jupiter to Venus.

2. A Geologist, Fifield, with a history of attacking authority figures and whose prior experience consisted of the grading and sorting of Coal mine Tailings for specific wholesale markets.

3. A Biologist, Millburn, who was removed from his post at a Children's Zoo for allowing schoolchildren to handle directly all the creatures in the poisonous animals exhibit while also having a medical history of personal delusions that waiver between running away from imagined threats in panic to running towards real threats in denial of the danger to his and others personal safety.

4. Staffing the rest of the Crew with undeveloped character types who seem to have been born without names, ambitions, or the ability to question rash decisions but would blindly follow anyone or any order given to them to collect a desperately needed paycheck.

The Board of Trustees who were allied with CEO of Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland, did not have full confidence in the declared mission, suspecting the intent and plan of Vickers. To ensure their interests they secretly recruited Elizabeth Shaw and convinced her that they needed someone inside to ensure the success of this mission and that it was in her interest and that of her Husband Charlie Holloway to join them.

To this end, Archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw, agreed to the following:

1. To have a Top Secret Military Vaccine that would give her immunity to the Virus that was to be infected upon the crew- thinking that it would protect her instead from Foreign and Alien Contagion's- This she thought was also to be Administered to her Husband, Archaeologists Charlie Holloway, as part of the agreement.

2. To be genetically Engineered both physically and mentally to have Extreme Military Survival Capabilities that she would have, Super Endurance, Super Pain Tolerance, The ability to Reason quickly under stressful situations and recall the use of Military Tactics and strategies and surgical /biological training to enable her to forgo any environmental hazards that may pose a threat to ordinary human Physiology.

**RECENT MISSION COMMUNIQUE RECEIVED***

It has been communicated by secret coded message by Weyland Board of Trustee's Agent, Elizabeth Shaw, to update the mission directives. This message has been relied to top military Officials and this Interplanetary Council due to the Boards Deep concerns over it's contents.

It is as Follows: I, Elizabeth Shaw, report the unfortunate loss of all Prometheus Crew and ship -stop

Myself and Team Robot `David' all that Remains of mission have commandeered an Alien spacecraft of the Race Known as the`Engineers'-stop

I and `David' have concluded and computed the most logical maneuver at this time would consist of not returning with this commandeered Engineer Craft as they may have inherent abilities to track it's inflight back to our Solar System through deep space-stop

It is unsure of True intent of Engineer Race, weither completely hostile or factious. That it would be best to Scout the Planetary System of the Engineer Race and gather further intelligence that may help our System to defend itself from a hostile attack.-stop

It is speculated the the Race of Engineers is split into two factions which have fought over millennia- that one Faction has developed race of hybrid creatures whose main ability is superior physical adaptability to any and all environmental extremes.

That the Other-Faction had Seeded our Planet with our genetic makeup with the intent to nurture and create a hybrid race that could evolve the capabilities of extreme Mental and Technological adaptability, that Our Race was the result of a Engineered Biological weapon whose sole purpose was to eventually to be recruited and trained to combat the other factions weapon system.-stop

That upon meeting directly with a Member of the Other Factious Engineer Race, that we were recognized as the Biological Weapon manufactured against them and determined to be an immediate unknown threat to this Factions Survival, We have managed to Stop this Engineer before he could retaliate upon our Planet and System- Unaware of the imminent danger his destructive payload.-stop

To say the very least it is startling to realize that we might have been only created as a weapons system, that our history and rapid technological advance into interplanetary travel rations this out. Is deeply troubling and Must call for deeper answers and clarifications from the Faction which may have created us? I believe that we are made of a Higher Calling that we are inspired by Truth and a greater call to advance ourselves
beyond our limitations.

May Our Race be granted Peace from this Impending Conflict.

Some have criticized the over-emphasis on character development, but I would say it's about time given the fact that special effects are now more important than plot or actors in most sci fi...  And Mr. Scott does nothing to diminish the involvement of top quality special effects to tell this story.  Yes, you do get the usual, ""idiot about to die"" alerts that are consistent with Grade B movies -- the two geologists who get lost trying to get out of the dome for example...  But the dazzling Noomi Rapace, as always on key Charlize Theron, eerily brilliant Michael Fassbender, a great job by Idris Elba and Guy Pearce, in a very clever role, cleverly blend the tech with the plot to produce a very slick film.  Ridley Scott has grown up and I've grown up along with him -- and this is a great movie.

Also, I was bummed that there were so few special features in the dvd version after I had heard there were supposed to be a lot of extras. They saved themm for the blue-ray edition, which stinks.

There are so many memorably dumb things in this movie. The characters spend at least 45 minutes of the running time walking through the same 3 tunnels looking at stuff. A lady scientist cuts her belly all the way across, including her uterus, pulls out a huge alien, then gets stapled together and walks around like she hasn't just had major surgery. Another scientist plays with a threatening snake alien like it's a squirrel, then is completely shocked when it eats his face off. And, to top it all off, there's a young actor inexplicably made up in the worst old man makeup I've seen since Ed Wood was alive. Instead of using an actual older actor, the director made up his nephew or something to play the part.

It's not the dollar and a half I wasted renting it that drove me to Amazon to post a review, it was the 2 hours of my life I will never get to live over.",1352505600,3,926,4.255681818181818

It was a simple thriller (not without its issues) with a simple, yet effective thrilling climax. And then...

Spoiler Alert!!!

Little back story to remind those what happened. They find out their Creators ultimately decided humans weren't all that good and wanted to kill them all. Elizabeth Shaw and crew go into the caves to wake the remaining blue Creator. Elizabeth tries to ask why they wanted to kill humans. Blue man's response: kills everyone in the room (Elizabeth escapes). Now cut to the ending. Elizabeth decides to hi-jack a ship, not to return home, but to find their Creators actual planet to ask them... sigh... ""Why do you want to kill us?""

Because it worked SO WELL the first time, right? So you land onto their planet, an entire planet who wants to kill you. What do you think will happen? A warm welcome and a polite discussion on morals? Um, no, they'll probably kill you on sight. Also, you just alerted to them that Earth is still full of humans. GREAT JOB!!! Now they'll start their project all over again.

No, I'm not over-thinking the ending. I was barely thinking and I immediately notice how stupid the last five minutes were. You don't need a brain to realize she's on a suicide mission where she will most likely not find an answer before they smash her head in.

And no, I haven't seen the Alien movies so I don't know what actually happens, if anything from Alien follows Prometheus except for the iconic aliens, that is. But whether or not I've watched them doesn't matter. The ending was just stupid.

Watching this, I notice that the technology showcased between the two films were simular in style but the level of advancement in that technology for both stories was about the same to me. So I can not tell if this happened before, after, or during the same time period. For now, I will have to keep any judgement about it being a ""prequel"" on hold.

But, this movie is well worth the purchase, especially on Blu-ray. And, it does well as a 'stand-alone' movie without any association to those other films. ""Prometheus"" has that Ridley Scott feel to it as you would expect from his previous 'SCI-FI' projects, and the imagery is a 'feast for the eyes'.  The story is suspenseful, shocking, and a little thought-provoking but that is Ridley Scott's 'Modus Operandi'. I can not expect anything less from this director.

From the grave, the elderly ""captain of industry"" explains that two of the passengers on the deep-space flight might have found the ""fathers"" of mankind - god-like creatures who visited Earth millions of years ago, and who left cryptic drawings in caves and on the walls of underground passages all 'round the world, drawings that seem to point the way for humanity to find them on an as-yet unexplored planet.
Of course, each of the characters in this ensemble cast has his/her own agenda, which often conflicts with the others' dreams of glory.

Lots of people said it was confusing or full of holes and not really a prequel but a side-ways blah blah whatever. I have no idea what any of them are talking about. The plot was fairly simple and easy to follow. The idea was well laid out and not at all confusing. It was a very direct prequel to Alien. There was no beating around the bush, no questions about anything. The ending left it open for more story to be told, but certainly didn't leave much unanswered.

The movie was visually, probably the best movie I've ever seen. To explain that a little better, the CGI didn't look like CGI, it looked real. It was like a cross between CGI and rubber suit technology. CGI always leaves me feeling like I just watched a cartoon and a rubber suit always leaves me feeling like I just watched a guy in a rubber suit run around. When the creatures featured here did their creature feature thing (say that 5 times fast) it left me with the feeling of; wow that was awesome.

The chick from the dragon tattoo flicks did an extremely impressive job of equaling (if not surpassing) Sigourney's B.A. sci-fi chick image. She went from delicate religious flower to (Spoiler Alert (sort of))""I'm going to go ahead and carve myself up like a pumpkin to survive"" in a relatively small amount of time. The most impressive thing about this transformation was it didn't seem rushed or false, it just seemed like she was truly terrified, and had no choice but to suck it up and take it like a boss.

One thing a lot of people harp on, that I totally agree with was the scientists did a lot of really dumb stuff. I would argue though, that they were put under quite a bit of duress before they started acting ignorantly. I'm sorry, but if I'm on an alien planet and I discover the very first signs of life outside of Earth and then immediately discover that those signs of life were killed heinously by unknown assailants that may or may not still be lurking around the spooky caves I'm in, I'd probably experience a slightly heightened stress level. This could possibly be accompanied by a slightly lowered ability to properly assess my surroundings and act with the utmost clarity of thought. The scenes in particular that people are harping on, can be paralleled pretty easily to the original Alien film, which nobody seems to be harping on. Would I let in a crazy zombie-alien infected crew mate? Hopefully not, but I wouldn't let in a crew mate that had a giant spider-squid stuck to his face either. The thing we have to realize about horror movies in general is, if nobody did anything that allowed them to be put in terrifying situations, the movie wouldn't be scary. This is a movie about two scientists that want to find the origins of life, and a bunch of support staff that could care less about that and just want to get paid. The exception is of course, the always questionably unethical android that may or may not be working for ""the company."" If those scientists didn't want to go out and explore, the movie wouldn't have gone anywhere. It would have been about a spaceship that landed on an alien planet whose crew then did nothing except say ""this looks like it might get a little scary, lets fly back home for 3 years and report that it looked scary so we did nothing."" According to the critics, this is what would have made the film more realistic and therefore, more watchable. I respectfully disagree. Sometimes making stupid mistakes is what people do. That makes it more realistic than having a ship full of 180 IQ nuclear physicists that never make any mistakes or act questionably.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, this movie was awesome. Anybody that says it was dumb has a problem with separating fantasy from reality and realizing that sometimes one does not need the other to be good. I would say this was the best installment of the Alien franchise yet and I can't wait for the sequel. It was suspenseful, had an awesome story, fantastic visual effects and top notch acting from everyone involved.",1352419200,,4135,4.509333333333333
4785828,4,B005LAIHY0,"If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers, below.

I saw Prometheus first when it was in theaters and found it interesting but somewhat bewildering in some of its plot development. On taking a second look recently, I found I enjoyed the film much more as a nave journey to find the extraterrestrial origins of the Earth.  The opening of the film is among my favorites, as we watch the robot David going through his daily routine as the crew and scientists sleep.

The idea of setting off on a space voyage in search of alien forms of life is hardly a new concept in film.  What makes this film work are the strong performances of the cast.  Michael Fassbender's David is fascinating to watch, although a robot exhibiting high intelligence he also imbues his character with a touch of humanity. He is nave and sinister by turns. He mimics Peter O'Toole after watching Lawrence of Arabia and administers the lethal biological weapon being developed by the aliens without regard for the consequences.

 Noomi Rapace brings out the idealism of her character (Elizabeth Shaw) believing that the aliens they are setting off to visit will somehow be benign creators only to discover the opposite. Even though she has every reason to believe the mission is a failure, Shaw wants to pursue her questions deeper into how humans failed their creators. While Elizabeth Shaw represents the inspiration behind the expedition her fellow scientist and lover Charlie Holloway (played by Logan Marshall-Green) is the force behind the quest.

Charlize Theron plays the formidable Meredith Vickers, who represents the corporation financing the mission.  Clearly, Vickers does not believe in the mission and has no regard for the other members of the crew. The fact that she has her own module that can be ejected from the ship underscores that she intends to survive if things go bad. Her hostility is more than not believing in the mission and is only revealed by the presence of her father on board Prometheus.

The film has a lot of suspense but is also has plot twists that seem lifted from Alien. Some of the action is contrived and certainly, the unforgettable scene where the pregnant Noomi Rapace has radical surgery and manages to walk away stretches belief to the limit.  For me, with all its faults Prometheus remains a highly interesting film and one that I would want to see more than once if only to appreciate the stunning visual effects.  I would be interested in a director's cut that might fill provide more in the way of plot.",1352419200,,2533,4.797701149425287

It's ponderous, vague, meandering - but it still holds appeal for the fantasy-oriented audience who love epics like Lord Of The Rings, and whatever that other fantasy movie was with the blue things. Sadly this was marketed to those who liked Alien. That film (I and II)happens to be set in the future, in outer space, but was a tightly scripted, well-acted suspense and horror thriller that had little to do with science fiction. Also it was a great movie. A really great film, the opposite of this interesting but meandering fantasy.

It left more questions than answers and I just hate movies that make you figure out what they should be trying to explain. We got info about the"" Alien"" origins already from the movie ""Alien vs. Predator"" which made much more sense. This big budget catastrophe cheated us out of the big question outside the box of if God didn't create us then who did? Why? And where is this location in the multi-verse? It avoided the true subject matter and left us hanging so badly. The out the box subject matter is what interested me in the first place and not the fact it was an ""Alien"" prequel. It so sucked. If I could rate it no stars I would have. Please save your money on this one. It is not even worth viewing once. The best scene in the whole movie to me was when the woman manually gave herself a C- section. Wow. What a way to promote a so called block buster. No wonder this didn't stay in theaters long.

From beginning to end, the story is so flawed and derivative that this viewer was almost laughing out loud by the time the alien baby was discovered in Elizabeth Shaw. From the strange suicide of the ancestor in the opening scene to the inexplicably malicious behavior of David, most notably toward Charlie Holloway, you may find yourself scratching your head as to why the writers chose to use highly unlikely plot devices for their characters merely to achieve equally unlikely later outcomes in an attempt to inject some excitement into an otherwise drop-dead boring story. The huge disconnect between the noble quest of the travelers and what they ultimately find robs the film of any humanity or saving grace it might have been able to muster, much less provide any satisfaction in discovering the answers the travelers seek.  Apparently our creators were so bumbling that they were unable to contain their own biological weapon long enough to use it on us.  Again, there seems to be no rhyme or reason why they would want to annihilate us.  Oh, wait, they aren't the creators after all! Don't confuse the utter lack of originality as homage to Alien or Jurassic Park. This is simply a rip-off of some of those films' more notable scenes with some obvious cheap sexual inuendo thrown in (a phallic snake stuffing itself into the mouths of its victims? Please.). It's unfortunate that Ridley Scott chose to make such a soulless film.

I found myself cussing, literally CUSSING at the screen. I was asking myself questions like 'why the [expletive] would you take your helmet off while on an alien world for the FIRST TIME?!' and 'why in the world are you trying to play with an alien water snake you [long expletive]?!'. I mean this was ANGER. How could these writers be so dense about character and plot logic? How could Ridley Scott go forward with this? Why would Ridley Scott try to [expletive] destroy the franchise he created?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS ISN'T A PREQUEL!? YES IT IS! What's up w/ that last shot?! Why was was it necessary? ...(sigh)

My list of questions is too long, too extensive to list in this arena. But the bottom line is that this film is garbage. Beautiful garbage, with some of the best 3D since Cameron's Avatar, beautiful garbage with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, beautiful garbage with some of the best Red Epic footage ever recorded, but GARBAGE nonetheless.

So why did I just drop 30 on something which drew so much vitriolic criticism from many, many people (clearly myself included)? Because it's a great study on how NOT to write characters and story. The film had all the potential in the world to be something quite remarkable had it followed through with better logic. It reminds me of the Matrix Trilogy where 1 & 2 were a wonderful set up for part 3, and we were all left speechless when we realized that the best answer the filmmakers had to all those puzzling, intriguing questions was a big ass gun fight. There is a lot to learn from in this film. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is quite spectacular, and the production design is extremely well done. A few scenes are clever and disturbing, but as a whole, the best thing to be learned from this mess is that logic [expletive] matters.

* A quick note - The transfer to BD is good, the sound excellent, the special features (especially the making of doc) are extensive. The 3D BD is the version I purchased.",1352246400,17,2258,4.567901234567901

When it came available on Blu-Ray, I decided to take a chance and purchase the title rather than wait to view it first via rental. I was not disappointed. The film does an excellent job of showing the sequence of events that would later lead to the Nostromo discovering the huge abandoned spacecraft in the movie Alien. I did knock my rating down one star because of one major detail glitch in the Prometheus: SPOILER ALERT - the alien pilot should have died in the seat of his own spacecraft and not on the floor of the company lifeboat to properly bridge into 'Alien'. Nevertheless, it also shows how the 'Aliens' that infect their hosts will mutate based upon the hosts they take.

However, while believing that the plot-logic appears written by an excited 14-year old, let's not dismiss the additional lengths one has to go to in order to neutralize both Charlize Theron and Rapace, the latter appearing more like a round-faced girl scout than the girl from Dragon Tatoo, and Theron, whose character looks SO impressive, is forced to deliver such a mindless script that you just shake your head at the waste of Charlize. This movie puts the nail in the coffin of my ""Oh, it's a Ridley Scott movie,"" a POV I had assumed since Gladiator.

Idris Elba (captain/pilot) also is asking us to believe you pilot a zillion-dollar spaceship, tricked out with CGi'd advanced technology, but apparently give commands to the rest of the crew like the pilot of a bass fishing boat. For me, it felt jarring: you're asked to believe they have all these hi-tech gizmos but the writers don't even research any aeronautical / military command nomenclature and/or procedure for landing an aircraft, resulting in something so casual it's a combo of Billy-Bob meets Hans Solo. Look how Branaugh used Elba in Thor and as something worth comparing, because the waste of such talent and cgi budget is handled so sloppily it's difficult to believe that this is the same man that made Gladiator.",1352246400,39,1408,4.891213389121339

The movie gets too much hate in my opinion. But I guess some people expect too much out of it.

And by the way, this movie is based on facts. Look up 'Anunaki', which were considered to be large beings or ""gods"" by Sumerians who came to earth and genetically altered humanoids, and turned them into humans. That's how some say we were created to be who we are today, and that all of this darwinism theory is a bunch of b.s.. Just thought I brought that up.",1352160000,,575,4.314814814814815
4786874,1,B005LAIHY0,"This is not a review of the DVD. I'm sure it is quite delightful, however the movie sucked. I'll give it 1 star because of special effect. Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up. I really laughed my A_ _ off of this. I guess the script for this movie must have taken say 10 minutes to write. It is obviously totally derivative of ""Aliens"", with more special effects, less story. Same spaceship on dubious company business, same robot as key perpetrator of said company business, same deserted planet, same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings, same plans to decimate Earth, same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice. Big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships/aliens via a conveniently built road. The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the mesmeric, energetic lead in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" - her acting in ""Prometheus"" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocain look. And her hair? How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery. And she was ready to jump into bed with the first BBMF. Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race. I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius. This movie is yet another sign of the decline of Western culture, aided and abetted by Hollywood greed. The visual effects were stunning in Blu-Ray, but the story went nowhere - pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind; another is contrived. The Prometheus plot is what I would expect from a low budget horror movie - this one just has better special effects. Perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel? If that is the case, the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double - not an acceptable proposition - a movie must stand on its own, or be marketed as a series. I could not identify with any of the characters. Perhaps it is too much of a stretch to believe that all the highly trained and carefully selected scientists and crew would act like incompetent fools - they seemed bent on their own destruction, without any rhyme or reason.",1352160000,18,2746,4.527162977867203

Are there 2 factions of architects?What was up with the programing and agenda of the ""Artificial Human""?Architects visiting developing humans and leaving clues for what purpose? How many different types of genetic material are stored, or are they all the same? Why would Architects need a weapon? These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered. Prometheus II? Not really interested! Too many possible back stories and outcomes and all that I can imagine seem unrealistic and inconsequential.

4786876,5,B005LAIHY0,"I think the reason some didn't enjoy this movie was simply the hype one makes for themselves, and that most believed they were about to see a rehash of Alien. In ""some ways"" it is, but Prometheus is its own movie simply set within the ""Alien"" universe. This isn't the story of the xenomorph aliens of old per-say, this is the story about the Engineers, aka the Space Jockey race (of course there's religious things as well but you'll get out of it what you'll get out of it). If the decide to make sequels its already been stated such sequels will step further away from Alien and be its own thing, which I think is good.

This movie is visually stunning, breathtaking even. Top notch quality here. Ridley Scott shows off his abilities to make wondrous photography, something most who didn't like the movie but actually watched it might agree with. The sound is likewise as good, creating a vibrant surround sound atmosphere I think anybody with a home theater will appreciate. I can't comment on the 3D since I lack the glasses to view it on my ST50, but one day I will for certain. Extra's are plentiful with extended/deleted scenes, two commentaries, and a good sized documentaries.

People had these questions about the film they felt weren't answered throughout the story. I urge someone to watch a bit closer next viewing: most answers are within the movie, some extended/deleted scenes help likewise. I'm not gonna run through a Q&A on them, but I have one popular spoiler that baffles me whenever I hear someone didn't understand why the event took place (see SPOILER below).

In a nut shell, this is a great blu-ray and while not a Directors Cut with the extended scenes inserted back into the film, someone who loved the film will buy the Collectors Edition simply because its worth it.

<SPOILER: one common one is ""why did David poison Halloway?"" I thought that was answered in the film. He was commanded to ""try harder"" and took things the next step. No where in the movie does it state that androids have to follow the Asimov's Law. In a promotional vid, I know not in the movie but this is extra content to flesh out the universe and included in the BD, a commercial for David claims he will do things employee's would consider ""unethical."">",1352160000,,2256,4.6325

It really has some eye-opening scenes in there, and if you wanted answers, you'll get quite a few.

The only thing that really disappointed me about this blu-ray was that there was no extended/alternate/director's cut of the movie integrating the deleted footage.  I was expecting something more like the Alien dvds/blu-rays that offered a choice between watching the theatrical and the extended cut, but alas, there is no such option.  I suppose they're saving that for the ultra super collector's edition to be released at a later date.  That's the marketing machine for you.

4787441,5,B005LAIHY0,"First off, I went into Prometheus not entirely sure if I was indeed watching an Alien prequel or not. (according to the studio) First it was, then it wasn't, then it kinda was but they weren't calling it one, etc. Let me say that Prometheus most definitely is part of the Alien story. It just goes in an uncommon direction. The deciding factor in whether you're going to like this film or not, is what you hope to get out of an Alien prequel. If you're looking for a space horror like the original, this is not so much that. If you want an other-worldly guns-a-blazing action flick like Aliens, this is not really that either. What this is, is somewhere between those films, with a much bigger emphesis on story. As a movie-buff and one of those 70-80's kids who grew up on films like Alien and Star Wars, I constantly wanted to know what was behind everything. Where did these aliens come from? Who/what was that fossilized (appearing) creature sitting behind the big gun when the Nostromo crew entered the ship on LV-426? Who's ship is this & why was it there? Questions such as these are finally answered with Prometheus, along with one giant revelation to an unposed question. One that is much larger and far deeper than anything else contemplated within this series. One that could be potentially very disturbing to some. I will go no further into that aspect, so as not to spoil anything. Of course this film has guns-a-blazing action and the spooky atmosphere of the first two films... Just not to the degree of either one. This is a well balanced Sci-Fi film, with some truly spectacular visuals & effects that most importantly, do not overtake the story. If you're one of the few who has never seen the original Alien films, doing so is not really required (though highly suggested). The way in which these old questions are answered is not done in such a way that you ever had to have asked them in the first place. There is no big fanfare or fancy reveal, as to say HERE IT IS!. The film is thankfully not ruined in that way. But for those who have seen the first four films and have questions, the moments where everything just comes together are found in Prometheus. While this film could stand on it's own, it is left begging for a sequel, as all ends are not tied up and new questions are definitely asked.

As far as the picture & sound quality of this (Blu-ray) disc are concerned, both are absolutely stunning. Prometheus is quite probably the best looking & sounding live action BD I have ever viewed. To put simply, the picture is breathtakingly flawless. I could detect no artifacts, banding or any other negative aspect, even in dark & high contrast scenes. Color is vibrant yet realistic and blacks are decidedly black. Sound is dynamic with great bass and effects are precisely placed. Most importantly (and sadly uncommon) is the fact that dialog is consistantly clear and audible without having to adjust the volume between voice & effects. When it comes to picture & sound, Prometheus is of reference quality and sets a new standard.",1352073600,2,3060,4.614678899082569

There no reason to talk about this movie and spoil it for the viewer.  Just note, beautiful, excellent acting, a new wonderful chapter in the franchise.

4787585,3,B005LAIHY0,"i gave this movie a 3 star not because of the beautiful 3d evironments throughout the movie,but for the many,many unanswerd questions that left alot of fans hanging.first off,i am a huge ridley scott fan and as with most people who have seen this movie and have read the many reviews about it,it was obvious that the story left alot of us scratching our heads.ive seen this movie about 5 time already and must have gone through every scene with i fine tooth comb and i have to say this is one of the most mysterious movies ive ever seen by far.let me just give a few examples(although i can give at least 10).(1) when all the scientist went into the cave in the pyramid there were some kind of water/liquid flowing from the roof and on the ground.two of the scientist test there hand gauges and the temperature in the room was -12 degrees(thats very cold).what ever that liquid was it should've been frozen solid not running like  a river in the tropics.unless it wasn't water it could've been some other liquid or somthing.because we all know that water freezes at 32 degrees.(2) what was that metal storm that came out of no where?thats not nothing natural in nature and it appears that as soon as they entered in that room the storm started (i think that storm was a trap set by the engineers for protection).(3) while they were walking in the tunnel we see david use his fingers and picked up a green slime on the wall and smelled it and said""impressive"".what was that green slime?was it the same black goo/infection that infected the engineers?and what was it doing on the wall?i have so many questions to ask about this movie.my conclusion it this,ridley scott tried to make an alien prequal but he purposefully made the movie this way to leave it up to the fans and audience to make our own interpretations instead of just making a movie thats plain and straight to the point.i read that he is in the process of makeing a sequal that will be release in summer 2014.hopefully he will answer some, maybe not all of the many questions we all have about this movie.",1352073600,,2068,4.529411764705882
4787586,2,B005LAIHY0,"The Alien movies have had some ups and downs.  Obviously, the original was wonderful...not for the special effects, but for the fear of the unknown.  This movie was highly anticipated and left me feeling quite disappointed.  It seemed more of a galactic human origins documentary than a sci-fi horror.  The alien seemed fake and even disproportionate at many points.  However what put me off was the story line itself.  It was almost like someone was trying to convey their belief of the origins of mankind through a sci-fi movie.  I enjoyed the suspense of the original...that is what made it scary, not some profound  ""let's make the audience think"" story.  Overall, a letdown for me personally...glad I rented it through Amazon, instead of seeing it in the theater.",1352073600,,768,4.9375

I've seen SciFi movies made in the 40s/50s that were better than this one. It was obvious that Scott made this movie to capitalize on the success of Aliens. The movie is not well thought out, has ridiculous action sequences that make little to no sense. The movie was so bad that I now think Scott made it as a spoof of the Alien series. There are plenty of other reviews that detail all that is wrong with this movie.
If it made even the remotest sense, I would recommend it to those SciFi buffs that can overlook ridiculous actions by the crew but it doesn't. If you are totally bored, have nothing else to watch, like special effects just for the effects and can overlook anything, then you might consider wasting a couple dollars on this movie.",1352073600,2,860,4.314814814814815

the movie is great amazing special effects and strong acting. i think my only complaint about the movie is a that i wish it was longer honestly the action all felt very rushed and the characters didn't have much time to develop. if you have a 3d tv this is the perfect movie instead of a bunch of over the top effects like bullets and knives flying at the screen trying o show off the 3d the filmmakers manage to work it in in a beautiful artistic way thats helps the movie succeed both in 3d and not. the mix of computer animation and real hand built sets is also nice to see (Hollywood must have a lot of empty sets these days thanks to computers) and works very well making the computer animation feel more real.",1352073600,,1070,4.318407960199005

Prometheus is an amazing movie.  Before seeing it I had been told it was an Alien prequel ... that it explained part of the Alien Saga.  Even without the ties (although you barely notice its related to the Alien movies until basically the end) to the Alien movies, Prometheus stands on its own as a fantastic Sci Fi adventure.  Great story and plot with many underlying tones, Great cast if characters, effects, sound, set pieces, suspense, excitement, and some pretty gory moments all wrap up into one awesome time!

The Blu Ray is great.  Looks stunning.  Crystal Clear.  The 3D is also very good.  I was surprised how well the 3D played out at home.  So far Prometheuse is one of the best 3D movies I've watched at home (And definitely the best live action one, most of the best 3D movies I've watched at home have been animated movies).

Bottom line ... if you love action and/or sci fi, Prometheus is for you.  Would also be a great gift for someone too!

The bad: There are just too many random things that happen that come out of nowhere or don't follow logically from the action or are unexplained. Here are a few things that come to mind (and there are many). The main female character gets an emergency c-section, which was suspenseful and interesting. That's fine. But, she suddenly stumbles into a room where she sees their, supposedly dead, benefactor awake from his sleep. The emotion of the scene unnaturally shifts from the female lead's ordeal to the old man's awakening. Her very recently psychologically traumatic and physically shocking ordeal is suddenly an afterthought (and remains so for the rest of the movie). This is unsettling to the viewer because the plot line is not allowed to be carried through, or at least comes to a satisfying end. The female lead should be the one lying down receiving medical attention, not the old guy. The awakening of the old guy isn't even necessary to further the plot. Speaking of unnecessary characters, Theron's character is a total waste of space. She doesn't add anything to the movie besides her isolated chamber that comes into play at the end. Her presence also complicates the captain's raison d'etre. Isn't he the captain? They could have made him the evil corporate watch dog and saved some time and money. It's almost like Theron's character is included for star-power to sell tickets. Not only does her character not further the plot, she's annoying. Either make the captain the captain or eliminate the captain and make her the captain. There are too many characters in this movie with no clear purpose. Lastly, (and by that I don't mean the last problem) the male love-interest comforts the lead female character in one scene where he reassures her and it illustrates his zest of life, but in next scene, he is very quick to commit suicide by offering himself up to Theron. His actions do not follow what was established for his character. And, it is complicated by Theron's insistence that the door be shut and he dies (another reason why her character was a poor choice). It would have been better to have the male and female love interest have a tender moment outside of the ship when he realizes that he cannot compromise the security of the ship. Better yet, there could be an isolation area for just that purpose where he gets quarantined and he could eventually morph into something that the female lead has to reluctantly kill later. That would have added more meaningful, ironic tension to the plot, making us sympathize with the the female lead's choice to kill what used to be her lover. Oh, and another thing. The holograms and dead bodies are never fully explained and I don't see how they fit into the alien-development-ingestation-development-continuum. When we first see something ominous, they are the size of meal worms. Then, they grow to python-size. How did that come about? It would have been great for a scientist on the team to collect a small sample and then explain why the increase in development so that we understand its morphing capability later. Anyway, this ends the rant.",1352073600,,3175,4.8597785977859775

Well, that and the fact that it takes place in the same universe as Alien.  Well, Prometheus isn't quite the science fiction epic that many would hope for, but it is a highly enjoyable return to the genre from Scott, and sets the stage for future installments as well.  Noomi Rapace, the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, stars as an archaeologist that discovers the origins of mankind, leading her and her scientist boyfriend (Logan Marshall-Green) along with an interstellar crew (including a vampy Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, and Michael Fassbender in a brilliant performance as the android David) across the universe to learn the truth of humankind's origins, and naturally getting more than they bargained for.  For what it's worth, Prometheus doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does throw out a lot of ideas at the viewer, albeit a good handful of which form questions that never get answered...in this film anyway, by the time the credits roll, there's practically begging for a sequel happening.

4788274,5,B005LAIHY0,"Alright. Prometheus isn't for everywne. You'll love or hate it. Or like or loathe it. The plot is rife with holes, scientific method advisers were clearly not consulted in the studio's rush to get this movie out after god knows how many years since Alien now? And these aliens look way too much like us to be scary.

There are astronaut zombies and cobratic phallic hissing dentata-face things, as suggested by other reviewers. But it's more like a horror scifi Tone Poem. A sort of visual symphony. With proper logic notes and implausible hues, it kinda draws you into a world that's vast and alien, yet with archetypes sprinkled throughout which awaken glimpses of prescient wonder, harkening back to our genetic memories. What would confronting your creator be like? How would You fare?

Sir Ridley Scott has created a particularly potent world, and populated it with dunderheads. Monty Python in outer space might've done better, even survived the events. Benny Hill would've made it out. I'm talking about some of the writing required to get the crew from point A to point Z in the movie, with all the scares intact.  The actual actors played it perfectly. And even the characters were well rounded, for their roles. I think many sympathize with Shaw, as many as with David. When he says ""I think I can,"" at the end, it's chilling.

Themes in the movie delve into lineage, mortality and genetics, with emphasis on an alien catalytic fluid, where accelerated dna dissolution and recombination yields voracious organisms that quickly wipe everything out, morphing towards their host's form with every generation. The end of the movie is great in that regard, by the way.

Monsters? Exploding heads? Zombie spacemen? Self-induced abortion of a tentacled demon foetus? All there.

Presentation is epic. Sets feel totally real. Costumes, setting, lighting, spacecraft, effects? Magnificent. Biblical at points.

This is a companion to Alien, more than a prequel. What else happened in that universe, that Ripley happened on to? The events are in different planets... so it's easy to think of them as nearly simultaneous. So while Shaw is off looking for the creators, the colonial marines are getting splattered.

It would be soooooo freaking cool if Blade Runner was tied into this world somehow. It would make Ridley Scott's epic legacy even grander than it already is.",1351987200,,2371,5.030612244897959

4788377,4,B005LAIHY0,"... and on a sliding scale of all the ""Alien"" films, a solid ""A"".

Since my opinion of this film is favorable, I read many of the low-star reviews posted on Amazon.com to get a sense of what the complaints were among those who were less than impressed.

I agree with the nay-sayers that the viewer must overlook stereotypical characterizations and the outright illogical - if not stupid - decisions the crew of the Prometheus make over the course of this movie. However, some of those same critical observations can also be directed at ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", or even 1979's ""Alien"", all considered by most to be worthwhile movies, if not sci-fi classics. And much of what made those films great is what makes ""Prometheus"" rate my four stars... it is visually spectacular and terrifying.

""Prometheus"" returns to the dark, Geiger-esque set design that made the original so appealing and it surprises viewers with extra-terrestrials not seen in the earlier offerings. The plot, though often predictable, revolves around seeking the origin of humans as a species and man's quest for eternal life. This ""Alien"" prequel takes place in the not-too-distant future, from 2089 on planet Earth until New Year's Day, 2094, on LV-223, the moon of a distant planet. The effects and cinematography are superb. And director Ridley Scott once again succeeds in making the viewer feel the fear and isolation of the hostile environment experienced by the crew of the scientific vessel. In the movie ""Alien"", the tag line was ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" That line is still appropriate in ""Prometheus"".

If I had to point out weak points of this film, it would be the dialogue and sound. I initially saw Prometheus at the theater, which is where it was intended to be viewed. Obviously you lose much in the transfer to the smaller screen. However, because of the sometimes pressured dialogue, I gained more from the movie plot-wise after watching it again on DVD (it doesn't hurt to have the closed caption feature on or the remote close by). If you can get past this, the rest should be a breeze.

If you are an uber-critic of films you will definitely be disappointed. To the perfectionist viewer, ""Prometheus"" will be easy to pick apart. And no one will will be nominated for an Oscar here (althought there are good performances, especially and not surprisingly from Charlize Theron). As far as the same old, same old is concerned, there are the traditional creatures from the 1979 film, as well as a Ripley-like heroine, an android, a cavernous spacecraft, a corporate CEO heavy, and the oft-repeated stereotypical crew of both the good and the not so good. However, the movie is not silly or ridiculous and the suspense goes a long way in covering up most mistakes. The mapping ""pups"" are very cool, as are the new ET's. Especially impressive to me was the 5 minute or so lead-up to the opening title.

Since I've yet to see the perfect film and in spite it's flaws, ""Prometheus"" has earned my praise and recommendation. It is a fun film, not a documentary. It is meant to be entertaining, not informative. So to the folks who choose to use a critical eye in determining the quality of this movie by faulting the characters for blindly putting themselves in harm's way or in the roles so often recycled in similar sci-fi thrillers, I say lighten up. It's just a movie. A good scarey movie.

And without giving too much away, the end leaves plenty of room for a sequel.",1351987200,,3480,4.751655629139073

4788655,3,B005LAIHY0,"Let's begin with the good news: stunning special effects, great cinematography, decent cast.  That's the good.  The bad is a bizarre and far from plausible plot that leaves the viewer lost and frequently confused.  Fans of the original Alien movies even struggle to link the film to what we have seen in the past.  It is a bit more than frustrating.  Naturally we can excuse more advanced technology and cooler looking ships and so on (its been decades since Alien premiered, after all).  But come on.  The obvious dialog ""when you spend a trillion dollars, then we can follow your agenda"" (or words to the effect uttered by Charlie Theron's character) is hardly original or even interesting.  The rapidity of death to key characters in matters of moments is also a bit annoying.  And the fate of Theron's character?  Really?  That was a bit disappointing to say the least.

I'd have to call this an average film by recent sci-fi standards.  Buy it for $15 or less and it is a sufficient guilty pleasure.",1351987200,,1004,4.7011494252873565

It was a good date night movie with the kids gone. Uh, no kids need watch this unless you wanna stay up with them later. You have been warned.",1351987200,,408,3.927710843373494
4788658,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi was destined to be epic. However, it is not without controversy. Many people claimed the plot was confusing, or it lacked one, and that's to be expected from unintelligent movie goers. In fact, the reason I think so many people were baffled by the plot, or rather story, was because it wasn't a character driven plot but a concept driven one.

This is a bold move for any film maker, but Ridley Scott's genius was able to pull it off.

The concept this film wraps itself around is simply this: What are the origins of life on Earth? Where do we come from? Was it god? Or perhaps, aliens? There is a great line, edited out of the film but found on the special features, in which the lead scientist Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green, is asked what his scientific purpose is. He simply replies, ""To find the origins of life and smash all man-made religions proving them wrong.""

Needless to say, this is the focus of the plot, and the search for this answers is what drives the mission, the characters, and the story. The crew of the Prometheus find more than what they were looking for, and that makes the rest of this movie pleasantly surprising.",1351987200,,1192,4.5607476635514015

I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the tie in with the alien movie.
Yes some swear it is not a prequel but it is from the first gen face hugger,the first gen alien,to the spacecraft itself. (watch the original alien and judge for yourself.

arthur's review is one of the best (take the quiz for yourself), and read his one star review and you'll see why I agreed with him,and many others.( go,go, goto the one stars and read and take the quiz it's great fun!)

4788842,4,B005LAIHY0,"This Motion Picture suffers from often used devices and frequently parodied scenes from as it were other Motion Pictures. This does not deter This particular film from the ugliness of perversion with Nature being parodied by the Un-Natural. Photographs like Computer Generated Special Effects are a device used by so many motion pictures that events seem so like a stamp rather than an event with only so it seems the cost to deter this stamp from approval. This film is lacking more so of character than devices with neither human representation,male or female being particularly intelligent. It is truly unfortunate that opportunity as we have here is unworthy of such an accomplishment as to not be honest or even as it were intelligent. The Weyland Corporation with its Founder(?)appearing in a hologram for a purpose that should in fact represent the passing of time and perhaps even the eclipse of life for its founder. It is in fact not that,it is in fact a misleading opportunity that its founder is found to be a liar,a contemptable bastard with an entire position being created into a emergency medical module that is designed to extend his life till such time that a quest for perhaps more life is arrived at. It,most certainly is not a sufficent answer however the getting of ones way while all the while being at the expense of the crew is. This is a notable act of treachery that his money and his corporate influence seems to provide even this picture with that is, it is the result of the abuse of Power and its accompanying influence that underwrite this pictures place at all. The speech which accompanies the hologram introduces certain members of the crew which apparently other members either do not know or are not aware of at all,however perhaps we should know when there is a ""souless"" entity on the ship named ""Dave"" who is in fact a robot. The Robot concept is almost foolish as ""Dave"" is not truly a robot but more so ""Dave"" represents a parody of life and as it were even Nature. The concept of a souless robot seems not to explain that one Dr. Shaw is deceptively violated and a very threatening and dangerous parasitic evolution unfolds. This as it were souless robot is in fact a dangerous adversary who would like nothing better than to return to Earth with a ship sized Parasite just waiting to dis-embark. The film offers that ""Dave"" most certainly is not without his political moments, when passing time he on a bicycle tranverses a  Basketball Court and from some 25 ft launches a right handed hook shot that goes in(LaDiDa,LaDiDa).""Dave""as well is caught up in as it were wanting to be like with neither Nature or even a Human Being something ""Dave"" wanted to be like.""Dave"" so it seems wants to look like and perhaps even be like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. This reference to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and even as compelling the basketball court scene suggest that ""Dave"" is like our Humanoid character possessing Racial as well as Aryan conceit. He practices the languages that may of in fact be the language of ""The Humanoid"" and later on is rudely dealt with though perhaps his undoing had more to do with not knowing the ""Humanoid"" rather than not speaking its language. The disaster that unfolds does place opportunity as a reckless even provocative position whereby none will survive. The utter careless and as well uncaring path that the entire crew followed was anything but careful or perhaps even more to the point even scientific. There was a hands on approach to such danger that only death can be thanked for getting rid of these idiots. Death here is more than merely the unknown,it is in fact what may be driving this mission to begin with, with the results being something predictable and not entirely unexpected.""Dave"" possesses a loyal and pre-determined position whereby his creator may in fact be ""The Weyland Corporation"", ""Dave"" so it seems is following orders. ""Dave"" is very dangerous and this concept is most certainly not lost on Dr. Shaw. The name of the ship is ""Prometheus"" with the year 2089 being the year that this picture for the most part takes place. The Crew was placed in a state of suspended animation with the time of 2 years 4 months and 20 days having been eclipsed as the ""Prometheus"" traveled from one galaxy to another in a location suggested to be the galaxy ""Alpha Centuri"".Something of a look a like to this particular Milky Way world that presently the Earth is located. The ""Humanoid"" like individual is difficult to know as his or its purpose is as well not entirely understood. The Reference earlier to Photographs is suggestive as an illustration of what this race of humanoid beings might be capable of-It appears that the ""Humanoid"" may only if anything be many copies of himself. This is indeed perhaps even a startling discovery that this discovery is not as yet knowable however The ""Humanoid"" is more than merely a threat. This is a dangerous development with a undetermined cause providing Its place at all. The picture leaves no doubt that the ""Humanoid"" is or perhaps was planning to attack the Earth and had the technology to do it or so it would seem. It is truly not entirely clear as to who or what this ""Humanoid"" creature actually in fact represents. Some of the film suggests gentically engineered DNA completing something of a quest as to Mans place in the Universe. There is not enough information though some might say more is needed to know. Appearing in a 2 Disc-Documentary, titled ""The Nazis:A Warning From History""There is a photograph of Nazi German Dictator Adolf Hitler looking intently at a bust of this films ""Humanoid"".This reference provides an integral link as to who this being in fact represents. He in fact represents an Aryan concept and further his place is as a superior human being. There is a fight nearing the films completion between The ""Humanoid"" and The ""Parasitic Octopus"" with the ""Parasitic Octopus"" indicating just how dangerous this creature was to begin with. The result appears to be a creature that defies pre-history. This was the result of the violation of Dr. Shaw whereby the ""Parasite""  came from a large depository,almost like a weapons hold and seem again to represent a underwriting of Bio-Terroism. This film is an attempt upon mans place and perhaps as well it prescribes another world entirely. This as it were alternative is not really an alternative but the end of this world and our place here as well. The threat that this film represents is truly felt with the discovery of both the ""Humanoid"" and the ""Parasitic"" developments. The Parasite should not be ignored however the ""Humanoid"" ship possesses a weapon which as much as it serves notice it is symbolic as well as in fact a very formidable looking development. This is in fact something that looks familiar as there is a War that is about to be Launched. It is a unmistakable Alarm that needs to be put in place to properly ascertain how to gauge this  threat. This is a real threat and a real threat is what this picture wishes to be. This is the agenda this world has underwritten with the Motion Picture and it is this motion picture that is conveying this threat.",1351900800,,7186,4.756410256410256
4788843,3,B005LAIHY0,"As a prequel, it seems a little jumbled, with a few minimal surprises in plot twists. When things are down to the nitty-gritty, the last remaining 'Ancestor' could have completed his diatribe at humanity and told Shaw why he was ticked off at us. David was typically two-faced as the 'artificial human' creations seem to practice for the Weyland ilk. The 'unexpected sleeper' was one of the real surprises, along with the unexpected 'blessing' that Shaw received. I didn't really expect such a radical result of her pregnancy, even though it all 'turned out for the good' in the end, for Shaw. Obviously, the ending left room for a sequel, but the time window will have to be strictly observed and events occur rapidly to avoid 'crashing into' Ripley on her trip back to Earth... All in all, the hype exceeded the results, but it was still watchable. I must confirm that the character portrayed by Charlize Theron was exceedingly harsh and unfeeling, revealing, to me at least, a different aspect of her acting abilities that were both impressive and unpleasant. Personally, I hope to never see her in that portrayal mode again. I had not seen Prometheus before viewing it in my home, but the movie was OK, overall, just not as good, nor as entrancing, as I thought it would be.",1351900800,,1278,4.73542600896861

The complicated, exotic looking two-hand flame guns are less impressive than a can of hair-spray and a Bic lighter, and the movie is filled with lame effects such as that. Maybe the cliches will make it a cult film just for the silliness. If it were a book, no one would read it, there is no plot or imagination, and I wouldn't even call it sci-fi, it's just ridiculous low-budget fantasy.",1351900800,4,609,4.648148148148148
4788847,5,B005LAIHY0,"In my view this is the best of all the alien movies to date.  It is something like ""the selfish gene,"" meets ""2001-a space odyssey.""  The movie had great depth and stayed with me for days after watching it, which I did twice before writing this review.  The writing and acting were very solid and if the viewer paid attention, the meaning of the film was quite rewarding.  SPOILER ALERT!  The movie starts out with one of the tall aliens standing on a earth-like world, next to a massive waterfall, with an alien space craft hanging in the air overhead.  With a religious air, he kneels down and opens a jar and consumes some kind of substance, which causes his body to come apart and he falls into the waterfall.  His body breaks  into many small cells, which grow and divide as they are carried off by the enormous river they have fallen into.  This is an act of creation, and as the movie suggests, it is how the human race came into existence.  The movie then moves forward in time, introduces the 2 scientists/archeologists who have discovered that most of the ancient races on earth worshiped these tall humanoid beings, that they came from a star system depicted in cave drawings, and that humans could not have known about this system without modern technology.  The scientists call the tall ones ""Engineers,"" and they feel they are the ones who created our race.  A dying billionaire decides to fund an expedition to this system, so that he can meet his maker.

There are 2 very interesting characters that mostly survive the movie- the heroine, Elli, who I felt was very authentic and a great example of what is best about humanity, and David, the android, also authentic, but not being human does things that are evil at times.  For example, he asked Charlie (the other scientist and Elli's lover) how far he would go to find the answers to the questions he has about the engineers.  Charlie says he would go all the way to the end, so David slips an alien substance into his drink that causes him to mutate and eventually die, but not before impregnating Elli with a bizarre alien that nearly kills her.  After a timely abortion, Elli and David discover that the engineers have decided to return to earth and destroy the human race, to build something anew; however, the captain of the Prometheus is able to collide with the alien ship, causing it to crash and our race is saved.  The one surviving engineer comes after Elli to kill her, but she outwits him, using his own technology (and something from herself as well).  Elli now has the option of taking another alien ship and returning to earth, but she decides she is going to travel to the engineer's home planet, to ask them why they wanted to destroy the human race.

I like movies that show humans at their best, and this one certainly does.  Perhaps when they take a closer look at Elli, the Engineers may decide their creation was better than they thought.  I really liked this movie!",1351900800,,2957,4.573055028462998

The ""plot"" is convoluted and really not very interesting.  Several times throughout the movie I found myself scratching my head and saying ""huh?"" If you're looking for an intelligent,engaging, believable sci fi flick, DON'T rent Prometheus. You're better off revisiting the first or second Alien movie, or even Blade Runner.

4789124,4,B005LAIHY0,"I had high hopes as there was so much hype in the theater pre-release clips and critic reviews. Once I got the Blu-Ray I popped it in and was surprised how long it took to get to the first screen. Some of that is due to the player I am using but it took way longer than any other movie I have including Avatar. Once I got into the presentation the visuals were mind-blowing and state of the art.  Definitely a 5-star for visuals.  Absolutely stunning through out the entire movie. Watching this on a quality 3-D screen would definitely be the way to go as the visuals just want to take you along with its majestic mountain scenes as well as the different views from afar and within the sets created. Audio was spectacular as well in rich HD stream. The movie nicely pushed my 5.1 system and I was pulled in and into the dialogue as if I was right there as the center speaker pushed greater than most movies I have. It was very easy to make out the words and there was no mumbling or inaudible vocalization heard. Matter of fact, I turned the center speaker down a bit as the DTS pushed it a bit stronger than I wanted and after toning it down a bit it was more surround than otherwise. So for this, another 5 star.

I won't get into the details of the movie itself (explaining the story line) as that could be covered elsewhere. Anyone who sees this movie will know what I am talking about with the following commentary. Where I have to drop it some is in the story and acting. Here I was a bit disappointed as character development and the acting is a bit curtailed and kinda not polished (real). The movie could have put another 10 minutes into it and enriching the main characters a bit more to allow a better/fuller understanding instead of a few one-liners or very quick summaries. I felt they were rather rushed. It just didn't flow for me. The plot and story line was interesting and it developed quite nicely but for me it wasn't the message I was looking for. Perhaps this could have been a two-parter movie that would maximize on some further background coverage as well as generate further detail that would really sink me into the characters personalities. So for the first time it is usually an entertainment perspective and the second time it is a technical analysis but it progressed rather slow for me so I got into the technical before its time as you tell my my commentary. Nevertheless, I will be watching it several times hoping to gather more information about the characters and plot and story line. So I guess I could give this an overall 4.5 stars if you want to get right to it!",1351814400,2,2603,4.385093167701863

Just like in horror movies when the girl investigates the dark by herself (which should not happen in real life), in this movie the characters do stuff real scientists wouldn't do but who cares?

I will refrain from citing specific examples save for this one.

4789548,2,B005LAIHY0,"This is one of the worst movies I've paid to see and I while I hardly review films I wanted to share my disgust with this so others save their $4 to rent.

Why was it so bad? I already saw this movie, it was called ""Alien"". I then saw Aliens, Aliens II, III, and then Predators and Aliens I-IX, etc, so on and so forth.

Did we really need another Alien origin story? And was it really an origin story for Alien or Human or both? You see, that's the main problem I had with this film. Scott had clearly dropped a ton of references to Alien throughout the film but the storyline had no clear path and tried to do too much as it hopped around for what seemed like 3 hours and then boom there's an alien.

The entire story made little sense and there wasn't any real draw for why a couple of scientist spelunkers would travel to a particular star system looking for big dudes (titans, woah Prometheus made us!).

Exploring the stars is great, but why does it matter where you're going? Do you really need a cave drawing to convince you to go somewhere and why do you need Guy Pearce to get there? Apparently so as Pearce's character is the vehicle, literally and figuratively, for how they get to the other planet. His character was useless though and due to editing it was rendered meaningless.

Ridley used the idea of rich guy looking for immortality as the rational for him spending $1trillion to go across the universe, umm, what? Ahem, if I had $1trillion and I could freeze myself indefinitely and had a android son I would probably just tell him to wake my ass up only when there was a cure or some way to just download me into Data from Star Trek. In other words, don't wake me up when you find giant aliens that kill people, oops!

Michael Fassbender really mucked things up for Guy but he was probably the most interesting character in the movie and yet he was pretty clichd and was turned useless, except I guess to tell the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo how to get out of the movie, too bad he didn't tell us how to get our money back, zing!

On the whole Ridley Scott wasted too much time doing nothing and fails to deliver - there were so many directions this film could have went and there was a ton of time to actually tell a story but instead he drops Alien all over the place. Maybe why it didn't work is because this is two movie ideas mashed into one, perhaps Ridley was looking to make a movie about Prometheus and couldn't help himself, and so he pulled in aliens?

Honestly this movie is just boring and every scene where an alien jumps out is expected and something you've all seen before. By the time the climactic moment comes you won't give two shits about any of the characters nor will it be interesting how the titan is defeated and when the movie is ""over"" you're not going to be surprised at all when an alien-alien is pooped out.

I will just add that in the instant watch rental there was an added bonus with an alternate ending that's slightly better and brings more meaning but it's nowhere near enough, but it made me wonder, did Ridley Scott film more scenes like this, scenes with more dialogue, and the studio cut it up in editing?

Finally - if this was a free rental I would probably have given it 3 stars. Sometimes having to pay for something makes us more critical and $4 was a bit too much for this, hoho!",1351641600,2,3347,4.290015847860539

In fact it is rather dull and attempts to be 'deep,' which is part of its problem.  I'm not sure we care all that much about these big white men coming to earth to create us.

4789556,5,B005LAIHY0,"I confess that I was among those who initially panned this movie. Like others, I felt that the film was all visual razzle-dazzle and weak plot, characters, and action. I too was annoyed by the ""muddled"" plot and apparent lack of character motivations. But, having seen it twice now on blu ray, the films strengths have become more apparent to me. Character motivations make better sense to me now. In particular, I now see how deeply and consistently insulted is the character of David. And so, I see why David does what he does.

Largely on the strengths of the character (and characterization) of David, I now believe that Prometheus is a solidly fine film. Does it deserve five stars? To me, that ultimately depends on the quality of the sequel(s). If no sequels are made, Prometheus will only be an interesting film with unrealized potential (ditto if Prometheus spawns bad sequels). But, if the follow-up film(s) are as good as this first film in the series, then I believe Prometheus could wind up a classic.

As a film series Prometheus has real potential. As the themes receive further development, I can see Prometheus plumbing depths of profundity rarely seen in films. I just hope that the initial bad reception won't nix the sequels or strip them of the budget they'll need to have.

4789646,1,B005LAIHY0,"Some movies just should never be made... this is one of them.

This movie stands on the promise of awsome trailers (which by itself should indicate that it would not be worth it as now-a-days trailers actually are much better to watch than the movie that often don't even include the scenes in the trailer, or the scenes are so far apart that they convey a different message when they are packed together in the trailer than they would have in their movie positions) and the hint of Alien influences both of which are let down by the movie... there was no suspense driven by any of the potentially ""creepy"" scenes...

This is clearly an establishment movie that extends future installments a possibility to become better but clearly they are seriously lacking in many areas.

By the way, the inclusion of a Chrisian believer in the movie (the woman with the cross) shows just how lacking in understanding of religion that exists in the holywoodites these days in there full tilt effort to become anti-religion they often show a false faith ideology in their depictions. It would have been better had they made up a religious symbol that had no connection with any modern day religions cause Ridley Scott demonstrated just how bad things have become these days -- Even Frank Herbert of Dune did better at building the religious mythos around the pre-existing ideology -- oh yeah, he was a novelist and not a holywood type movie maker who are used to producing top billed B-Movies

If I just wanted to watch the movie again, I'd ""rent"" it.

This version does have alternate beginning & ending outtakes and deleted scenes, which are cool, and a commentary track or two, so it's not a total bust.  Maybe somewhere down the line, they'll release all the special features as a separate disc for those of us who didn't get them with this version.  It would make a pretty cool companion DVD, as there are almost 4 hours of ""making of"" documentaries.

4789845,5,B005LAIHY0,"Well worth the wait!

Only speaking from personal experience, I found this motion picture to be more than worth the wait to receive it.

Having been a Ridley Scott fan for years, and having the good fortune to start viewing the Alien kingdom of films in the theater when it was released in the 70""s, I can further offer my opinion that Prometheous caps the Alien series with a ""Gold Cup"".

This is quite easily the best sci-fi film to come along in a long time. The production values are above par; the acting is sublime; the writing well-written and well-conceived. The photography simply dazzling; the CGI is used to great affect, without it detracting from everything else which makes this film.

If you are an Alien fan, missing this film is anathema to you. After watching Prometheous, the grand arc of the Alien storyline comes into focus and is clear.

What the author postualtes grabs you at a deep, visceral level, and you don't see it coming, the surprising way the film eventually resolves.

I envy all of you who are watching this for the first time. Just one thing you must count on:  therre's is no way ANYONE will be able to see this movie just once. I've already watched it five times, and I'm still getting things I missed.

Have fun!",1351641600,,1251,4.553571428571429

A GOOD MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU THINK AND QUESTION THINGS!!!!!!!!!!! Albeit, there's no way you can get everything that Ridley Scott intended for you to get from one viewing. That said, it's a great movie that's extremely well made.

As for the product... It's a fantastic set. Great behind-the-scenes mini-docs! Everything from production information to little, well made, supplements to the plot of the movie like Weyland's TED talk and a ""commercial"" for David. The extended and deleted are excellent! This is an absolute must for anyone who liked the movie and wants to learn more about the Prometheus Universe.

4789847,4,B005LAIHY0,"I saw some of the removed scenes on youtube.
What is wrong with Hollywood?
I think if a movie has to be 3 hours long, it has to be 3 hours long.  Is it the theaters who request 1.5 hour movies?  Prometheus was running a bit long, so they just had to cut some scenes?  So, after you want the movie, go watch the scenes that were cut out.  There is no way I was not going to have seen this movie, at that point you are glad that you rented the movie instead of at the theater.
You think some weasel does not go up to the ""Lord of the Rings"" folks and says,  ""hey , can you cut it back to 1.5 hours?  Come on, how about 2 hours?  You are killing us!  How about  2 hours and 15 minutes?""",1351641600,,683,3.7535211267605635

4789852,3,B005LAIHY0,"We enjoy sci-fi movies.

This movie was about . . . I'm not sure.  Some of the visuals were amazing (the intro scene in particular).

The futuristic medical technology was fascinating. In other ways, it seems to have been an attempt at delivering a storyline with some deeper meaning.  Connecting it with something associated with our understanding about our own world (and its people) or world's future, or other worlds (and its people or beings), amounted to an aggravating stretch, albeit possible.  We were waiting for a really ""whow"" moment beyond the medical technology scenes but it never happened.  There were times when it seemed like the delivery within certain scenes was mere unimaginative thin threads to a message.

At other times it was a bit difficult to take the characters seriously because the script in those particular scenes were not really valuable--although ordinarily I would consider them good actors.  Perhaps the sequel will be more interesting and engaging since the Alien-looking creature which popped out in the end looked like it had somewhere to go.",1351641600,,1082,5.107954545454546

In the (apparently) raging contest to see which disk author can do the most to ruin a Blu-ray, we may have a winner. Not only does a giant white bar cover much of the screen if you pause or slow the film (and this is a film that begs you to watch the FX frame by frame), a second bar appears above that one, a guarantee that you won't be able to see anything you want to see. Although they disappear after a few seconds, they reappear with every frame advance, virtually disabling your ability to study the FX. Compare this to the Harry Potter films, for example, where NOTHING appears on the screen when you pause it, which is exactly what a competent author does with a disk. Unfortunately, this one was authored by SLIME MOLD.",1351555200,,829,4.286624203821656
4789956,4,B005LAIHY0,"Movie was better than expected, likely due to the lackluster reviews by some who had high expectations of closure with respect to the Aliens series.  I liked it.

I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel to this movie where the origin of the ""Engineers"" or the motive for transporting alien creatures to Earth is pursued.  As expected, awesome special effects.",1351555200,,468,4.602409638554217
4789957,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott ensures the continuity of the Alien story with this accurate (finally) prequel to the series. So far I haven't found a loose end in the story. A friend mentioned that in the Alien series, one of the giant ""human"" aliens is found in a spaceship control chair with it's chest exploded indicating the release of the newly ""born"" alien. But in this movie the giant alien is killed by the hero. Answer: It was stated that there were many ships that never would leave the planet. Hence the hero escapes in one of the other ships left behind and the ship found in the original series was just another ""dead"" ship with it's dead pilot.
Note - The players were a bit cowardly albeit they were not told why and where they were going. I think just to go on this type of dangerous expedition through hyper-space just for the money, they would have more guts and not run away like teenagers in a vampire flick. But it still worked, ergo 5 stars.

4789961,2,B005LAIHY0,"I can overlook a bit of departure from reality in the name of eliminating some tedium from a film, but egads!

  Here's the trouble.  None of the characters are introduced to us in any real way, and what scant development exists, only makes the viewer want to root for the aliens. Because we don't care about any of these people, there is no real tension when they are in danger.  The mission itself is evidently not understood by the writers themselves.  The childish and obnoxious ""good"" scientists want to go meet our alien creators, but once launched, the mean, evil commander says that they have a different agenda, and that no one will be making contact with any aliens. Repeat---there will be absolutely NO contact with the aliens.  They then land and immediately set off to go make contact with the aliens.  Plumbing the depths of the alien catacombs, they remove their protective helmets and start grabbing hold of anything that looks deadly or poisonous with the gloved hands so that they can gauge the gooiness of the strange material, and inspect the snottyness level by spreading their fingers apart and seeing how stretchy it is.  The android figures out how to use the buttons and he plays them all a hologram of the aliens running around and getting their head caught in  a door.  They then open the door and bag up the head  so that they can poke at it back on the ship. Due to their impeccable scientific protocols they observe, the head only falls off their dune-buggy once on the way back to the ship.  But they accidentally nuke it anyway, so. . .

  It gets dumber. A scientist gets killed because he sees a hissing, sputtering snake like thing, and he starts cooing at it, and tries to pet it like it was a retriever puppy (watch the movie if you don't believe me.)  An evil but aging rich guy who is hoping to find some kind of life extending goop has stowed away on the ship and announces his desires.  This supposedly explains why the android spiked one of the good scientist beverages with some slime and caused him to accidentally impregnate the other good scientist with a gut buster.  She removes the offensive reptile by having a serve-yourself-surgery machine make a massively intrusive incision in her abdomen and salad-thong the creature out of her. Once patched back up with a series of huge steel staples, she goes about her business, occasionally moaning to show that she's been cut open and it still hurts a bit. For some reason, she doesn't  see the need to bore the rest of the crew with details about this ordeal.  They then go to the alien ship that is somehow immured in a mountain, where they wake up an alien and ask it for life extending goop for the millionaire.  The alien shrugs off his slumber and proceeds to festoon an old fashioned tail-whooping on any human within convenient range.  The tummy surgery chick escapes and the creature tries to launch the ship to go destroy earth (we never really know why the good scientist is privy to this info).  She radios the ship who kamikaze's into the alien ship (killing most everyone) and brings it back down to the planet.  The good scientist uses the android head to hot wire another conveniently available alien ship, and she takes off to go. . .home?  No. She wants to go to the alien's home planet to find out why they want to kill us so badly. . .I'm not kidding.  I guess just going back to earth would make a sequel harder.  On this screen writing fart, the film ends.

I'm giving it two stars for visual effects and unintentional comedy.",1351555200,4,3542,4.560126582278481

I don't care that it wasn't a direct prequel to Alien.  I don't care that it left the ending wide open for a sequel.  I do care that the story and characters were never fleshed out to the point where I was invested in what happened to them.
There were several points where the movie showed flashes of brilliance, only to then to fall back into the convoluted mess that it was.

I also didn't realize - going into the movie - that it was meant to be a prequel to Alien.  Throughout the whole movie I kept thinking to myself that it was very similar to the Alien franchise, just with a slightly different twist.  In the end it made sense why it felt that way, but even then there were lots of questions throughout the movie left unresolved.  Perhaps these will be answered in upcoming movies, but the direction it was heading didn't imply that was the case.",1351555200,,976,4.606936416184971
4790305,1,B005LAIHY0,waste of time and money. all over the place and just plain nonsense. left you with a ???? feeling. guess it was all a prequel to aliens or something. not as action packed as the trailer lead on. avoid this movie.,1351555200,11,212,4.195121951219512

Given the timeline of other Alien films, this one actually raises many more questions that it answers -- which is perfect for me.  Prequels always have a problem that they have to end in a way that you expect them to lead into the next movie, but this one doesn't try too hard to do that, and does so in an exceptional way.  [Spoiler alerts] For instance: if we know from other movies that Predators were already on Earth prior to this movie, then how do we know that the Engineers weren't going to Earth to attack the Predators, not the Humans as those in the movie assume?  We know from later movies that the Aliens and Predators are mortal enemies, so it only makes sense that the Engineers were also enemies with the Predators  -- Engineers being out to create life and Predators to hunt it.  I also truly enjoyed the switch that occurs in who you think the hero of the film will be.  The character makes a real transformation, shows amazing strength, and really makes me feel the pain that she is enduring throughout the movie.
I haven't actually watched the 3D version of this yet, but the Blu-Ray is great.  I'll update the review when I do.",1351555200,,1491,5.183333333333334

4790312,3,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" had much promise but where it succeeds visually it falters in it's story telling.  There is no natural cohesion or flow to any of the scenes save for the opening sequence which is actually my favorite part of the whole film.  In those first few minutes, I truly felt transported to a world alien and foreign.  Once we return to earth, although only moments later, I had great anticipation for what was to come but increasingly became disappointed.  There are so many questions left unanswered and I don't understand the logic in the decision making to some scenes.  Why did the first engineer in the beginning eat the black stuff?  Why did the awakened engineer immediately become violent?  This wasn't just an origin story for the ""Alien"" franchise, it hinted at being the origin for all humans and I couldn't wait to see what would be uncovered.

Being a huge fan of science fiction and of Alien and Aliens, I can't hate this film.  It is related to those beloved films even  if it's a third cousin once removed.  Ridley Scott remains a master of visual story telling.  It was some of the best 3D I've seen so far.  Being a fan of the television show ""Lost"" I was excited to see what Damon Lindelof would introduce but much like his successful television series it seems as if he was just that...lost.",1351555200,,1331,4.6127659574468085

4790467,1,B005LAIHY0,First of all i start by saying that i waited to see it after buying it because i felt it would be great but i was wrong. If you are a true fan of Alien then you would know certain details don't add up and it wasn't much of a prequel. Lance Henriksen was the actor who owned the company and in ALIEN VS PREDATOR was a great detail of his death and way in Alien 3 he was found out as a robot. See Predator 2 at the end as u can see the skeleton trophies. one of them was Alien related so as u watch Alien vs Predator you get the full picture of details that this movie failed to display.,1351555200,2,585,3.7642276422764227

The director counts on (extraordinary) visual effects to bail him out almost as if blinding the viewer by cool tricks would mask the many internal inconsistencies within the plot. I was unable to relate to any of the actors, which was intensely dissatisfying -  the movie lacked, for the lack of a better word, humaneness. The characters were unidimensional, without an inner life as well as unconvincing (especially the scientists). When the best act is provided by the robot well then the director has a problem.

4790579,5,B005LAIHY0,"When I first saw Prometheus in the theaters, I knew that I would be buying the film the day it was released on home entertainment. Sure enough, I did and have been spending the past week or so combing over all the documentaries, photo galleries, deleted scenes, and commentaries provided. I have soaked up every bit of information available and am confident to say that this is probably one of the coolest movies I have seen in a long time. The commentaries, in particular the wirters commentary, were very informative and the deleted sense added even more to insight to the film. I remember thinking when I first saw the film that the engineer was CGI but was delighted to learn from the 7 hour long documentary that they were actually people in suits. You never really see too many films these days that use practical effects and that's such a shame.

I was a bit shocked when I saw all the negative feedback from audiences online but later came to the conclusion that this was to be expected. I can only assume that the majority of negative reviews come from people who have only ever seen the movie once. This is NOT the kind of movie you see once and come out of it knowing 90% of the plot (like The Avengers). You have to comb over ever detail, pause at every action shot, and afterwords apply a little brainpower to make sense of it all. There are many subtle pieces of information that one could very easily miss with just the blink of an eye. I honestly don't know what all this nonsense about plot holes is about, but please watch the film yourself and make you own judgements.

So overall, the film is now one of my personal favorite and the content in the special features sections is of superb quality. I do however wish that Mr. Scott had left some of those deleted scenes in the final film; they would have made it even cooler. I look forward to seeing the sequel!",1351468800,,1879,4.427745664739884

4790719,2,B005LAIHY0,"The only thing i enjoyed about the movie was the set production and special effects, visually it was appealing. Considering Mr Scott's rep, this was well beneath his previous work. The story is weak, the characters are unrealisticly idiotic, and the choice to make this a prequel was absurd since its ability for special effects was far superior to the other movies and so therefore makes the technology in the others appear primitive.

Alien is on my top ten list of my all-time favorite movies and I could go on endlessly about how great that picture is - I won't. But its worth remembering how effective Alien is without the use of computer graphics, leaving the viewer to fill in what is not actually seen.

Ridley Scott did a spectacular job creating the environment for this movie. Photography was awesome and the cast did a great job. The story was well executed. The play on DNA works well in solidifying the clues to the mystery of our origin. The reason I gave it 4/5 is because some parts were a bit far fetched and took me out of the spell of realism. But I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the movie.

It just seemed to me to rely on these things more than a great plot. I would recommend you see it but would rent it not wait for the DVD.,1351382400,2,267,4.254901960784314
4791122,2,B005LAIHY0,"I knew beforehand that this movie was a prequel to the other alien movies, but thought that finding out how they came about would be interesting. I thought the plot was formulaic and the plot twists made me think the writers and producers just decided that instead of following the usual formula they would do a complete 180 on how the plot resolved itself which made a lot of the movie not make any sense at all.
The movie started out with an alien dropped off on ancient Earth drinking a dark liquid that causes his DNA to rip apart into tiny pieces and he disintegrated and fell into the waterfall he was standing next to. This causes his DNA to merge with other DNA fragments in the water and leap ahead however many thousands upon thousands of years and we see two archeologists finding a cave painting with big aliens pointing to a star formation which is similar to drawings they found in six or so other cultures.  Kind of the typical alien calling card, ""Come see us when you figure things out and can travel across time and space.""
So they travel to the star system, find a planet and several underground passageways that will later be revealed to be a ship. The team is the usual you expect from the Alien franchise, the company man(woman), the scientists, the warriors and the android who seems to be up to his own agenda. It's no surprise at this point that only one of the female scientists would survive just like the unstoppable Ripley. She also gets pregnant with an alien creature that gets removed in a gruesome way.  Apparently, the aliens that spawned the human race did it so they could use the same thing that killed the alien they left on earth to wipe out all life on Earth.
The man who funded the mission reveals himself towards the end of the movie after having left a video message saying he was dead of old age by the time they arrived. This actually explains why the android was operating on his own, he was trying to find the aliens so they could ""fix"" the old man and give him eternal youth. Inexplicably, the alien they revive just starts roaring incoherently and killing everyone except for the lone female who escapes the ship just moments before the alien launches. A suicidal kamikaze attack using the ship they arrived in to ram the alien ship stops it from leaving the planet, but they jettison the luxury suite life pod moments before they kill hit.
Now or lone survivor goes to the life pod and searches for supplies only to stop when she hears a noise. Amazingly, that little creepy crawly turned into a monstrous creepy crawly and the alien who is now pissed and looking for her appears and they begin to fight it out until she ""strategically"" opens the door to the monstrous creepy crawly and it kills the alien, basically by wrapping itself around the alien and shoving something in its mouth. Needless to say, the queen alien rips out of the dead alien's chest and gives that famous double teeth smile.
The disembodied android head tells the last survivor that there is another ship which they use to leave the planet, but not to return to earth, no, they plan on finding the aliens home world to ask all the questions the audience is asking, such as, why did they create life on a planet just to destroy it with a biological weapon they nearly wiped the aliens that created it out? And why did we pay all this money for a movie that claimed it would reveal the beginnings of the aliens (okay, it did, it was an accident, really? A bunch of aliens want to kill us and ""accidentally"" start the series of events that creates the aliens) then left us with another unanswered question that will most likely go unanswered?
I was disappointed, if anything the android that was deciphering the door locks and knew how to control the ship could at least have found the time to read the alien captains log and said something like, ""We are getting tired of visiting Earth, last time we were there we were mistaken for albino basketball players and paid too much for coffee from a place called Starbucks. The experiment is a failure, well just wipe the surface of the planet clean. Next we'll take a long nap in stasis and let the Earthlings come to us with our wakeup call so we can fly to their planet and wipe em all out. There is no way this would give them time to figure out a plan to stop us, we're bigger and by golly, smarter to as they will never figure it out.""

I think it adds that element to the story that allows you to do the digging yourself and connect it without having it all laid out on the table, which makes the anticipation for the next movie all the greater for me.

It's introduced some amazing new ideas (ie the Engineers, the predecessors to the Aliens, other worlds and possibly other creatures to discover, the evolution of the Alien race, why the Engineers decided to destroy us and why they never made it to Earth), and continued with some of the original ones (unprofessional crew even though there'd be nothing fun to the movie if they were more professional/intelligent, cliffhangers up til the end, unfinished business at the end of the movies), which to me is everything necessary for a re-imagined prequel, which is essentially what this movie boils down to.

Watched the DVD, not the Blu-Ray (3D or regular) yet but this film is the best Sci-Fi film to come out in MANY years. It works on all levels as a standalone movie, as Ridley Scott says it is, or pseudo prequel to Alien.

Honestly, I love Ridley Scott, but I have a couple of small harsh comments about his statements. Either he is lying about it being a sequel to Alien OR he thinks most movie watchers are blithering idiots. WHY was this on a moon and not a planet as in Alien, Why were the original aliens planting eggs inside humans, why did the alien ship look EXACTLY like the alien ship found in alien and WHY did the final alien look almost identical to the aliens in Alien, maybe they morph as in this film. There are so many unanswered questions. That's why there is already a sequel being made.

I've viewed only the BluRay version of Prometheus, so I can't comment directly on the extras.  But given how unimpressive the movie itself was, I'm unlikely to spend much time with them.  I don't have a 3D TV yet, but 3D can't improve this movie's shaky concept, screenplay, and on-screen execution. Or some surprisingly crude CGI effects, such as depiction of the ""Engineer"" alien characters.

Overall, this movie was as sloppy as the mission and scientific procedures depicted. Come on - you land on an alien world which you know nothing about - with darkness approaching - and the next thing you do is to haphazardly drive off in rover vehicles at high speed?  And then you take off helmets inside an unknown structure without analyzing potential pathogens and contaminants?  And you intentionally handle unknown black goo?  I nearly stopped the movie at that point, but decided to keep watching hoping it might improve from there.  Unfortunately not. There were some interesting tie-in points to the previous movies, such as some back story about the petrified pilot and a vague idea how the nasty xenomorphs originated.  But the plausibility of the scientific methods and procedures got even worse - to the point of being laughable - which I doubt the makers of this movie intended.",1351382400,5,1408,4.923728813559322

Probably under go training for months and months to actually know the ins-and-outs of the ship they will be living on for the next few years. Instead, they wake up, not knowing who is on the ship, and introduce themselves. Really? Then we get inept scientists. We have a biologists talking to a snake-looking creature like its a puppy and going to rollover and play fetch with him. DUDE, THIS IS A DAMN ALIEN AND YOU'RE STANDING IN A ROOM WITH A CORPSE!!! There is also a geologist (rock expert) who brings with him cool mapping droids that map caves out by themselves, and HE gets lost in the cave. A geologist with mapping droids gets lost in a cave.  A GE-OL-O-GIST gets LOST in a CAVE. Really?  Really? Movies like these can at least make their fodder characters a little bit more realistic. And when a giant donut shaped ship is rolling like a tire and going to crush you, don't keep running in a straight line! Take a 90 degree turn, jog a couple steps out the way, and let in roll on by. Damn, people! Oh and get this, they were actually outrunning the donut ship until they TRIP AND FALL. Really? We need the ""trip and fall"" scenario like we are watching Friday the 13th?

For all the stupidity in this movie, Im still a sucker for sci-fi movies, and this one does have some cool stuff in it. I loved the cave mapping droids. The doctor capsule, and just the overall exploring alien planets. If the characters were actually capable of their professions, this could have been a great movie.

The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the the mesmeric,  energetic lead in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""  - her acting in ""Prometheus"" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocaine look. And her hair?  How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery.
Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race.  I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius.

4791557,2,B005LAIHY0,"Let me sum this ridiculous movie up for you and thereby save you time and money.

**** (SPOILERS) ****

Some people go to space to find the ""Engineers"" that created us.
They find some goo. One guy unintentionally eats the goo.
He has sex with a women. Within one day of sex, she has a squid for a baby; the baby was removed by C-section.
The squid-baby grows really large and kills an Engineer (who was trying to kill the squid-baby's mother).
An alien jumps out of the Engineers stomach.
The end.

The effects were cheesy (you will laugh at the ""scary"" scenes) and the story was poorly written.

I was looking forward to the exploration of (what I thought was) the central topic: mankind's creation.  But there was none of that. At the end there were no answers to the big questions of life, just a set-up for a sequel.",1351296000,4,820,4.403973509933775

3. And better than the other two!! The story was dy-na-mite!!! I will watch it again because there was so much that I think I missed. THEN, I watch it again with the director's commentary.
For me, there is a LOT to think about in this movie! Plus the story is well-paced in its telling and the special effects had me looking away a couple of times.

I was pinned to the seat for about half of it. Very worth the time if you like sci-fi, sci-fi ethics, or Charlize Theron as a cold-hearted bi#$&. They could have tried a little realism when it came to the spacecraft, though.

Have to say, though, that I really loved the surgery machine. Might have been a tad loose with how it would work, but the concept and cgi was cool an original.

4791739,5,B005LAIHY0,"If you came looking for xenomorphs and Colonial Marines, you left disappointd (and likely savaged the film because you didn't understand it).  Prometheus is an origin story, not only of the xenos, but of US.  As such it was more philosophical and open-ended than a simple shoot-em-up.  Dont get me wrong, Aliens is still my favourite of the series, but this one is the only one that requires you to THINK.  The Engineers sent an ambassador ""two thousand years ago.""  They were horrified how he was treated.  So horrified that their ultimate biological weapon (that was to have been used on Earth if we, their creation, had not turned out right), which reacted to strong emotional energy, went off without their control, killing them all.

Lets see, human mythology, a couple millenia before the events of Prometheus... Space Jesus.  Yes, Jesus was an alien sent here by our Engineer creators to check up on us.  Humanity not only rejected him, it slew him in horrific fashion and perverted his message into one of hate and bigotry.  They would have used the canisters on us, except that they were so distraught over the treatment of their ambassador that the canisters overcame the safeties and set themselves off.

There.  Now you understand Prometheus.  Watch it again in a new light.  Give it the 4-5 stars it deserves, not the 2-3 for not having pulse rifles and flamethrowers.",1351296000,,1381,4.821276595744681
4791740,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott is an amazingly talented director, and this is an admirable return to horror/sci-fi for him. I wish I'd seen it in 3-D, but I was too eager to get the HD download to wait for the Blu-Ray (and I  missed it in theaters). There are some questionable casting decisions that bothered me, specifically casting Noomi Rapace as an English scientist named Emma Shaw, I think, when she's only been speaking English for about a year. It would have taken little more than a five minute search and replace function in the script to make her a Swedish scientist working in an international operation and then she might have spent less effort trying to get an accent right. She's a brilliant actress,(The Swedish Stiege Larson trilogy) and in the latter 45 minutes of the movie, when so much of the acting is physical, you can absolutely see why she was cast, but why they made her English seems like giving her an extra stone to carry when it wasn't necessary. Likewise Idris Alba, who is almost always terrific, and successfully played a Baltimore gangster for five years on The Wire without a hitch in the accent, is cast as, I guess, a Texan. He was credible, but there was no reason not to give him a Cockney or Northern English Accent if you needed him to be working class.(He plays the captain of the ship.)

You don't care about any of that. It's a fun, flashy, sci-fi horror movie with first-rate actors. It's not quite as scary and atmospheric as Alien, but it's cool to look at. You'll be tempted to try to think too hard, and a lot of people who saw it said they found it confusing, but it does resolve and explain itself by the very end, so just sort of hang on for the ride and think, ""I'm watching a monster movie, not a philosophical treatise.""

4791743,3,B005LAIHY0,"There were so many aspects of this movie that were great, and so many that were bad.

(Spoilers!)

First, the good.  The visuals are breathtaking.  I actually think they are better than Avatar.  Truly awesome.  Also, I thought it was pretty cool the way this movie ties in with Alien.  It's not a direct prequel, but it lives in the same universe.  We are introduced to the beings that the crew of the Nostromo run across on LV-426 in Alien.  Not sure if LV-426 is the setting for Prometheus or not, but it's definitely similar.  The special effects for the move are top notch.

Now for the bad.  First, there's almost no character development.  You never really get a chance to get to know any of them.  Unlike Alien, where by the end of the movie we not only know Ripley, we like her and we're rooting for her, Prometheus never gives us a character to root for.  A few of the characters have real potential, most notably the captain of Prometheus.  It feels like we're supposed to really like this guy, but we don't get to know him well enough to get there.  In the end, there is no hero in this film, and no real antagonist, for that matter. In addition, there were too many unbelievable characters.  For example, the Holloway character.  This guy is supposed to be a scientist, yet he comes across as a loud-mouthed, moronic douchebag.  For example, while inside the alien ship, Dr. Douche realizes that the air inside is perfectly breathable and decides he wants to remove his helment, even while everyone else is urging him not to.  Dr. Douche doesn't once consider that while the air may be breathable, it may also be full of airborne contagions.

Second, the story itself isn't developed well enough.  We're landing on the alien moon within the first few minutes of the movie.  I would have liked more development of the back story, the ancient carvings that led the scientists Shaw and Holloway to draw their conclusions, the challenges of convincing someone to fund a mission, etc.  I would have also liked more development of the story behind the Guy Pearce character.  This all seemed very rushed to me, and never realized fully.

Third, there were too many stupid story elements.  For example, at one point in the movie, two of the Prometheus crew members get lost inside the alien ship.  A storm is coming, so no one can attempt a rescue mission.  The two lost crew members will have to spend the night in the alien ship, which I'm thinking would be a major issue.  No one really cares that these guys are lost inside of the most important discovery in the history of mankind.  The captain actually tells them that he's going to bed and to sleep tight.  Good luck, don't get into any trouble.  Don't you think real scientists would have been monitoring their every move, talking them through it, using this time to maybe explore in a scientific manner?  Nope.  Find a place to hole up and we may or may not come get you tomorrow.  I'm tired, nighty night.

Also, I really need to point out that CO2 is not toxic.  This supposedly was the ""toxic"" substance in the air, and one of the characters even made the comment that the air was like car exhaust.  I think Ridley Scott is confused about the difference between carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.  It's carbon monoxide that is found in exhaust and is toxic to humans.  Yes, a person will suffocate from lack of oxygen if he/she walks into a room full of CO2, but it isn't poisonous like carbon monoxide.

In the end, I expected a lot more from a master like Ridley Scott.  This movie suffered from the common ailment of more thought put into the visuals than the story and characters.  Too bad, because it had a lot of potential.",1351296000,3,3696,4.533333333333333

4791799,4,B005LAIHY0,"In short, fans of the Alien films should find a lot to like in Prometheus, a sci-fi film that isn't afraid to ask questions and leave more than a few new ones unanswered in the process. Great performances by Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron make this film a must watch while Noomi Rapace of ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" fame and Idris Elba (The Wire) get to shine also. There are plenty of tense moments, especially one in particular involving an automated surgery that make this film a must watch as well. This is good, smart sci-fi with great production value and a willingness by its creators to pose queries and challenge its audience a bit more than your usual schlock.

The picture and sound on this Blu-Ray edition of Prometheus is pretty much perfect, especially the surround sound which gives your speakers a proper workout. The end of the film is especially bass heavy and pretty spectacular. I'm disappointed that the documentary that is available on the 3D edition of the film is nowhere to be found but you do get some deleted/alternate sequences complete with editor commentary, as well as a director commentary by Sir Ridley Scott and a separate one with the writers, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindleof.

4791803,2,B005LAIHY0,"I will avoid a distillation of my philosophical and theological misgivings with ""Prometheus."" All I will just say is that the film is a scientistic reiteration of Gnostic creatology laced with misotheism. Such an interpretation of our origins disagrees with my own outlook. Moreover, it is a stale hypothesis that creates more questions than it answers. That aside, I think that ""Prometheus"" also falls short in terms of storytelling.

Yes, the film is replete with dazzling visuals and vibrant colors. My heart was gladdened by Ridley Scott's rediscovery of these elements. They were the very same elements that highlighted films like ""Legend,"" ""Bladerunner,"" and the magisterial ""1492: Conquest of Paradise."" In recent years, Scott has eschewed such breathtaking visual elements in favor of an earthier, visceral style (e.g., ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" ""Body of Lies,"" ""Gladiator""). To see Scott return to his former aesthetic sensibilities was, in my view, a welcome development.

However, Scott's storytelling style has plunged into the very sort of incoherence that epitomizes the short attention span film-making approach of 21st century Hollywood. In contradistinction to most of Scott's early work, which was slower and thoughtful, ""Prometheus"" exhibits a ravenously kinetic narrative thrust that allows audiences little or no time to contemplate the ideas being presented to them. In fact, one could convincingly argue that some viewers might miss the ideas all together. This is unfortunate because the film's themes (human origins, exotheology, faith, etc.) should be pondered a little more thoughtfully. Yet, how can one do so when the story unfolds with such rapidity and the questions are only marginally broached by the characters themselves?

In short, ""Prometheus"" represents a very gifted film-maker's conformance to the modern Hollywood formula... Placate audiences with bread and circuses. Serious thought be damned!",1351296000,4,1930,5.602739726027397

Anyway, tired here, otherwise you'd prolly get a more cerebral analysis of the flick. Short is that I would probably only give it 4 stars, but I adore Noomi. And it had some obvious content.

4791807,3,B005LAIHY0,"The Movie Prometheus, starts off with a scene of one of the God aliens, ingesting a compound that kills him, and he falls over the raging water Fall, into the river below.  The compound the alien ingested rips apart his DNA, and causes new sequences to form, this is clearly shown in the video.  We are left to assume that his Dna being dispersed down the river forms, the basis of life.  A river being the source of all life in many cultures ancient writings, keeping with the theme of the movie.
  Then we meet the two Archaeologists who are researching the origins of man, documenting many cave paintings that have appeared throughout many cultures in time.  This part of the movie takes a hypothesis from the strange painting and carvings that have been discovered in Hopi Indian, Sumerian cultures to mean that Humans are an engineered species by extra terrestrials. Reminiscent of Erich von Dnikens' Chariots of the Gods.  The story is well done.  The quest of man to meet his maker to know God, then to discover that their God is flawed, with violent tendencies, at the same time you have a little drama taking place where the owner of the corporation that is paying for the expedition has secretly gone along for the voyage so he could meet his God, find a cure for his illness and become immortal, another example of a man with no faith, and comes to the end one would expect.
  The story of the God alien is obviously taken from Zacharia Sitchens research on the Annunaki carvings and Sumerian Cuneiform tablets. His book series on the Earth chronicles are a fertile ground of ideas, his research has been known for decades now.  I have long wondered why no other Sci-fi writer or movie maker has borrowed from this man before, obviously the writer of this film is very familiar with his work.  Overall Ridley Scott is an excellent story teller, the film was handled very well, the ending with the Captain of the ship and what he has to do was an example of mans nobility.  The special effects are not over done, which If they were it would  detract from a good story. From a Christian point of view the movie is incredibly blasphemous, but it is a fantasy movie not to be taken to heart Overall I say Ridley Scott did a fine job of story telling.",1351209600,,2257,4.513513513513513
4791808,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ok...first off, for those who actually gave this movie one-star, I recommend they either go back and sit through 'Alien' first, or stop commenting...this movie is far better than the first in the franchise, but it IS BASED on the premise that you have the intellect to understand what it means and represents, as well as a THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE of the overall Alien franchise.

If you haven't seen ALIEN, then do so BEFORE you watch this movie. Yes, it is a prequel...but you really need that first movie (1st in sequence, but 2nd in chronology) to actually understand the significance of the overall storyline.

That said...the cinematography was EXCELLENT, the story great, the meshing with Alien was very good...and while I understand the overall premise, I did manage to catch one technical gaff...regarding the 'space jockey' engineer...from Alien vs Prometheus...and that is in regards to the mummy found that 'had his ribs busted outward' that in Prometheus had not only 'left the chair', but you also see that 'the ribs' aren't ribs, but are part of a 'securement suit'...yet they show 'broken bones' in Alien...this is the ONLY discontinuity that I saw in the whole movie...

For that one gaff, I give this a 4-star rating...FAR BETTER than Cameron's AVATAR...this is dark, moody, dirty, scary, more-real for what ANYONE in the middle of no-where would quite possibly face...instead of some 'smurf world' with eco-friendly blue elves.

If you haven't seen it...see it today. I've watched it three times already, and still soaking in storyline details...definitely a 'deep intellect' movie worth the money!",1351209600,3,1611,5.137404580152672

The film opens as we float over a barren and desolate landscape. Standing on the edge of a precipice beside a Niagara like gorge,is a humanoid looking alien who drinks a strange black potion. As it courses through his body he literally falls to pieces and into the water,which reforms in it as new strands of DNA(ours?).Fast forward to 2089 and the Weyland Corporation has hired two archeologists to accompany one of their space ships to a distant galaxy/planet,which matches the grouping found in an ancient cave in some wall art. Of course this demands the use of cryogenic pods,as the distance takes over two years to reach. A lone android by the name of David,presides over the ships functions and reawakens everyone when the ship nears its destination.
They enter the planet's atmosphere,which is covered in clouds. As they finally get close to ground the sky opens up,and as they search they spot a large long ""runway"" which leads to a larger dome like structure;obviously not natural. Part of the crew exits the ship and enters the dome. They have artificial round drones that start to automatically map the interior. It is a huge complex and the Android David,who has spent much of his alone time deconstructing a myriad of languages,scrolls and ancient texts,believes if they contact any life,he can more than likely communicate with them. They run across some strange symbols on the walls and in short order David is gaining access to the inaccessible. He first activates a hologram which has holographic images of giant humanoids running through the corridors. They follow them which leads them to a large door with one of the creatures actually dead in front of it(decapitated).David gains them access through the door and into a chamber with a large head at the back of it,human like in shape. Leading to it is an area filled with sleek short stubby topped tubes with something in a black liquid inside them. Around all of them are shallow trenches into which the excess liquid drains. The rest of the crew takes the disembodied head of the dead alien back to the ship,while David secretly takes back one of the tubes.
Most of the crew make it back but two members stay behind because of a storm that comes up very quickly. David asks Charlie how far he would go to find out the truth of what is going on,and he answers as far as he would need to. They both drink a toast to that,but David has slipped a tiny portion of that alien black liquid into his drink. Back inside the dome the two men are roaming the room with the head and tubes. Suddenly a long thin neck with a bulb like head pops up from the liquid trench. At first the one thinks it cute until it latches onto him,envelopes his arm and eventually gets inside his suit and his mouth. The other man had tried to cut the creature off and got sprayed by its ""blood"",which ate through his helmet and he collapsed. The crew from the ship make it back to aide the two men,too late of course,but by now Charlie has become seriously ill. By the time they make it back to the ship ,he is in real dire straights and looks terrible. The ships head,Ms. Vickers,over rules everyone and won't allow him to contaminate the ship and carries a flame thrower to back herself up with. Charlie asks her to go ahead and incinerate him and she indeed does,as his girlfriend Elizabeth screams in agony.
It is around this time we learn that company founder/owner Mr Weyland is alive and on board. He is dying but is anxious to see if the alien on board,what they now have determined is an actual alien ship,can help him cure the disease he has. David had discovered(on his own of course)the ship control room and an actual alien pilot in stasis there. In the meantime Ms. Shaw has learned she is three months pregnant by her late boyfriend Charlie,whom she had relations just a day before. David refuses to tell her what the fetus looks like so she takes it upon herself to have it surgically removed by an on board medical machine,after David refuses to perform the procedure. What comes out is a small snake like creature which is held in the tube after she leaves it.
Shaw accompanies Mr Weyland,David and others over to the alien ship's control room where they awaken the alien. He is not a happy camper and sets about killing as many as he can before the rest flee,and then starts up his craft. Shaw and Vickers flees the craft,warning that the alien ship must be stopped,because it is taking its payload to Earth,which will be infected and destroyed. As the huge alien ship lifts off,the captain of the Prometheus puts his ship on a collision course and brings his ship and the alien one back to the ground. The huge alien ship kills Vickers as it settles back on the ground and Shaw barely manages to live through it herself. She makes it back to the wreckage of the Prometheus but soon hears Davids voice over the intercom. His disembodied head is still lying on the floor of the alien control room and he warns Shaw the alien pilot is coming her way and looking for revenge. When he arrives they struggle near the sick bay where the creature taken out of Shaws belly has now grown into a huge tentacled monster. She opens the door and it grabs and envelopes the alien pilot,depositing its egg within its stomach. Shaw escapes to the alien ship and retrieves David's disembodied head and his body to take with her. David claims he can pilot another alien craft,of which there are others on the planet. To Davids surprise,she wants to find out where the aliens are from and wants to go there to seek answers. The film ends as a young alien(the type we are more used to seeing)bursts out of the dead alien pilot's chest,standing on its spindly legs and screeching.
I recall Ridley Scott being so very coy in avoiding any comparison of Prometheus to the Alien movies before its initial release. But I think it safe to say that this is defintely part of the Alien franchise,a pre-quel if you will,and what a doozy. Like the first one it slowly but surely pulls you in and from then on you cannot help but be a ""prisoner"".The film begins with alot of questions and ends with as many. I like Scott's editing and pace. A fine example is the scene where David brings up the alien holographic schematic of our galaxy. The music rises in crescendo and it is a gorgeous moment of discovery(and visuals)by the character,and instead of lingering on and enjoying the moment to its fullest,the schematic suddenly ends(sooner than one would expect)and we're off once again. Scott had alot to tell and obviously didn't want to get bogged down in any one area too long,which enhances the entire dynamic.
Along the way we are seeing hints and visual cues of the familiar,from the Alien cannon. The egg shaped cylinders in the ""head""room(not unlike the more rounder versions the later Queens laid),another android(David)which,if you know anything about the Alien franchise,you NEVER trust,the Weyland company name(pre Weyland-Yutani)and for a bonus Weyland himself,the alien head they found and took back to the ship,we first saw in the original Alien,which turns out to be a space helmet,the aliens themselves,their attacks in which they go for the mouth and their manor of incubation in the stomach,the alien ship as seen again in the first Alien,and on and on. It is obvious how much new ground there is to mine regarding the Alien franchise and this back story. The franchise has pretty much been run into the ground these past few years and I am so glad Ridley Scott came back triumphantly to tell and sell a new chapter in the Alien history book. It is intriguing and absorbing and I cannot wait until the next one. Just an aside,I would like to see an extended version(which I am sure exists and will be released sometime)of this movie. It would certainly flesh out more of what we saw.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp. There are no extras here.
In conclusion Ridley Scott regains the Alien helm once more and breathes new life into this grounded franchise. The actors,the plot and the pace are all there. It's full of questions,some solved and others later posed. But you will eat it all up and be left wanting for more. Highly recommended.",1351209600,,8458,4.684811827956989
4791882,3,B005LAIHY0,"The movie ""Prometheus"" is not bad.  It borrows a great deal from many other movies, such as the ""Alien"" series, ""Event Horizon,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""2001,"" and many more.  But it blends ideas from those other movies together with some creativity, and it does offer a couple of new tweaks.  The underlying premise, presented in an interesting and very dramatic way at the very beginning, is somewhat new in this major-movie genre.  I thought more could have been done throughout the movie to detail the premise and keep one's thoughts churning on a deeper level.  Still, the acting, pacing, and special effects are all done fairly well, so that we fans don't feel cheated.  There was a twist at the end that might have been partly for the purpose of setting up a sequel, but it was a somewhat intriguing and thought-provoking twist.

Plot-wise, I think it held together fairly well, though I don't think that all of the connections that were implied between humanity and the Engineers were ever properly explained or borne out.  I found the characters to be a bit shallow; they were deffinitely just rolls, never quite fooling you into seeing them as people.  That said, the acting was fine, I just don't think the actors could do much more with the material, which was aimed at telling a 'big story' against a 'big backdrop', not focused on individuals or their stories.  The ending was only semi-satisfying, an obvious setup for a sequel, and established a tenuous, possible link to the 'Alien' series.  As Mr. Scott said, this movie obviously had a lot of 'Alien's DNA, but it's hard to say if it's an actual prequel or if it's set in some sort of alternate universe.

4792120,3,B005LAIHY0,"The purpose of Ridley Scott's film ""Prometheus"" apparently is to explain the origin of what was found on the hostile planet by the group of space travelers in the beginning of the original film ""Alien"" (1979).  The conclusion of ""Prometheus"" may be rather ambiguous to those not have seen it and seems to be setting us up for yet another sequel.

There are, as expected, amazing optical effects compared to the earlier ""Alien"" films, but I had difficulty in becoming emotionally involved with  the characters in ""Prometheus"" as I did not in ""Alien"" and especially in the later film ""Aliens.""  I have had the complete Alien collection for a couple of years now and  I still haven't gotten around to watching the third and fourth films in the series and possibly never will.

I'm not sure why, but I am coming to regard ""Bladerunner"" as my favorite Ridley Scott sci-fi film.  In its odd way it perhaps creates characters and a universe you can believe.  The Blu-ray release of this film is especially impressive and greatly encourages repeat viewing.  While ""Bladerunner"" cannot boast of the technical sophistication of ""Prometheus"" there is an atmospheric aspect to ""Bladerunner"" that cannot be denied that ""Prometheus"" somehow lacks.",1351123200,21,1233,5.004901960784314

4792124,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus has tanked. To be fair, I had fun watching it tank. Three stars for neat set designs and atmospheric images. Also, the trailer is fantastic. How often do you see a tailer that's better than the actual movie? Trailers deserve fair praise. This film is beautifully designed so enjoy the sleek visuals, but beware! Ridley mines his Alien franchise for time-tested, worn out, story tactics. Too bad. There were so many new goodies to play with; the meet-our-makers-premise, a wonderful cast of actors and a brand new space ship. It all seemed so intriguing. Gosh, you'd think Ridley had something fresh, inventive or even compelling to share.

No luck. Once the premise is established, the film hunkers down along a seriously beaten path filled with boring team dynamics, confusing plot points, and - oddly enough - the same old, icky special effects. Are you kidding? A gooey creature-thing got in my space helmet and messed me up. Again? A creepy android's decapitated head carries on a conversation while laying on the ground. Again?

The director does ring in Weylund Industries, the moon-like celestial system that the Nostromo will later investigate, the race that made the Alien, and the concept of invincibility and eternal youth and strength.  Overall, it is an interesting idea but it will need more films to fully develop the concept and to bring us up to the Nostromo story.

4792472,3,B005LAIHY0,"This movie is disappointing in a number of ways. First, the effects are mostly computer-generated, and thus hard to get excited over. This is 2012; we've seen all this before. Nothing looks particularly real, and the actors always have to try to respond to thrilling things that we know just aren't there. In a lot of places, it could just be another cut scene from the latest highly-promoted video-game release.  Then the characters talk unrealistically and act unbelievably, particularly in the intitial setup scenes -- which I found just plain boring. Once the overall plot of the movie is finally revealed, there really is no reason to keep watching this film.

  Prometheus could have made the Alien franchise scary again for a new generation (particularly because Scott was directing it). Instead, it's just your standard sub-par sci-fi movie. Sorry.

  On the plus side (and there aren't many points to be made here), it can at least be taken as the first serious effort to reinvigorate the series since Alien 3. It's not comical. It just fails. Also it has a very good cast, particularly the actor who portrays the android (but why must there be one in every film? tradition?)

  I was disappointed that Prometheus did not even manage to synch up storywise with the first Alien film. If you remember, in that movie Ripley's ship responded to a distress call and found a crashed alien ship on an inhospital planet. Ultimately they found a kind of ""bridge"" on this ship and the pilot dead in his chair, with his ribs broken outward. But in this film, though the ship still crashes, the pilot dies nowhere near his alien spacecraft. And what causes all these transformative phases of the Alien species, from octopus-like thing to retro-alien laying eggs to scitterers to chest-bursters to final Alien from 1979 film? It doesn't add up. What added up originally was an alien species that had evolved for eons on some distant planet into producing perfect killing machines ...

The last complaint I have about this film is that it ruins the fear factor of the Alien species itself. The Alien from 1979 was as frightening as it was because it was so completely alien to a human being -- it frightened in the same way insects frighten, on an instinctual level. But once you say (as this movie does) that human-like creatures created both men and Aliens, you link the two as brothers of a sort and thus lower that fear factor immeasurably, albeit unintentionally. And to those who respond that it is MORE frightening because it is somewhat related to man, I offer my humble opinion that an instinctual fear (say of the dark) is far more powerful than, say, a fear based on evidence obtained by science (like that the Bible if rife with inaccuracies, if not downright impossibilities).",1351123200,,2784,4.803347280334728

4792475,2,B005LAIHY0,"Here's the whole plot of this movie: A gooey substance is ingested by a guy who has sex with a girl who cuts a squid fetus out of her which then grows up and impregnates an alien who gives birth to another alien that looks like the alien used in the artwork earlier in the film. Other gooey alien babies come along and join the party.

This movie has an amusing concept but sadly it is six years too late - South Park already used this plot device in the episode Go God Go. It would have been nice to see Prometheus use an original plot but apparently Ridley and James are huge South Park fans and decided to enact Mr Garrison's explanation of evolution in a live action sci fi film.

In case you're curious, here's the Prometheus plot as explained by Mr Garrison in Go God Go:

""In the beginning, we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this retard frog-squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey-fish-frog, and then this monkey-fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey, and that made you. So there you go, you're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!""

Hope I didn't ruin the movie for you.",1351036800,6,1557,4.34020618556701

And she's a scientist! It is the same with the others in the ensemble. And doubly so for the characters who's deaths we only see but never having seen them before that.

4792479,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus has everything you would exspect from an alien film, great production values, talented actors, good sountrack, scares, suspense and should interest fans of the series as the film uses alien creatures designed by HR Gieger, which look like a disturbing cross between sex organs and something animal which is really what the film is working around and why some people don't know what the hell is going on the film. The film explores faith and religion and the origins of mankind a theme that was going to be explored in the third film but wasn't realised because of production problems. The film leaves alot of an questions, which is good as the aliens should have an air of mystery about them, and would leave the doors open for a sequel I hope. The performances are excellent especially Michael Fassbender and Charlie Theron and Niomie Raspace in the challeging role of female heroin after Sigourney Weaver, but the real star of the film is Ridley Scott who makes everything frame of the film look like a work of art and the film is innovative instead of going back to Ripley/survivers vs face huggars/aliens/alien queen sinario. Also I like the improvised scenes between Fassbender and Marshall-Green and a hilarious scene between Theron and ships captain played by Elba when out of nowhere he starts talking about sixties legend Stephen Stills, which for people who want to snigger at the plot and dialogue will be given a cheap thrill.

There's a hilarious youtube video where one guy rants about all the things that don't add up in the film (and he's right).  I can't link it here, but it's really funny.  Some guy on a couch sitting next to another guy sitting mutely.

Basically, scientists assemble cave drawings that point to an outer space connection to life on earth.  The aliens who probably started mankind, as well as life on earth, are called the Engineers and the scientists head into deep space to find them.  Good start.  Man searching for his origins.

But then the story begins to fall apart.  And the scientists appear to be the dumbest people on this mission.  The usual corrupt elements who want to screw over the hapless humans on the mission to get alien specimens jump the gun for some reason and turn the crew into their little experiment...a long, long way from home...and threatening to cut off their way home...wait...WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?  Knowing this film is somehow tenuously connected to ALIEN is like waiting for another better movie to barge into the movie you're watching.  And then it happens.

I bet that many of those ""1 star voters"" didn't even catch the symbolism in most of the movie. Sure there are moments that the audience cringes saying: why did that character DO THAT? But that adds to the suspense of the film. In crisis, not everyone makes the wisest of choices. Half of the movie I was yelling at the screen: ""Bad Robot!"". For me, he was the most interesting character besides Elizabeth (who by the way did a good job). As an audience member, half of the time I was wondering ""why is he doing that?"" and ""what is he thinking""?

There are surprise moments in the film. I thought it was well paced and not slow.

I'm rating it 4.5 stars for the overall combination of the concept, script, art, character design and acting. The symbolism is noticeable. It's all over the place. I won't spoil it here, but if you want to know more about it, google it.

4792532,4,B005LAIHY0,"I would initially say that this film - unlike the rest of the 'Aliens' franchise - poses significant ontological/metaphysical questions as critical structural elements (whether they are a well handled or not). I can imagine that the film could be offensive to some with strong religious beliefs. One could also treat these ideas as pure fantasy or even accept them as some kind of genuine critical thesis and enjoy the film because it really just uses these ideas as a vehicle for what is, after all, mostly an action-oriented sci-fi movie; one with a smidge more depth perhaps, than others. Cinematographically, handled with the usual deftness and aplomb that one would expect from Ridley Scott; though there are a few things that I thought were goofy (**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT** notably the escape scene of certain character having had a certain surgical procedure was particularly ridiculous and coulda/shoulda been at least 'scified' into a semblance of believability).

4792533,5,B005LAIHY0,"Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed this film. I thought the crew performed admirably, in particlular Michael Fassbender. For me, this film pitted Faith against solo reason , the Turin machine against man, the Search for Truth against nihilism, 'nothing, nothing....., annihilation, Death', and perhaps the mad scientists creating their Frankensteins, the bioweapons, who they in turn destroy. There seemed to be many subplots, themes. Who or what is the Prometheus, Zeus overcoming his father Cronus, the Kings who do not wish to relinquish their power, the created who loose their need for their creators, and the creators fearing the growing power of the created so that when they awaken and achieve their freedom it is time to cripple them. The Cycles of Life turn. The only apparent connection between this film and Alien is the bioweapon and the race of beings that created them, and perhaps the same purpose for those bioweapons, the destruction or enslavement of the human race on earth. I absolutely enjoyed the specail effects (I saw the film in 3D which dramatically boosted the experience), and found our Titan progenitors interesting. I believe this thread demands at least one sequel: the search for Truth, something that Transcends the Cycles of Life and Death, the Desire to Know, continues.....",1350950400,4,1313,5.140186915887851

They should watch the first movie one more time before they made this one. On the first one there were eggs with those nasty ""hands"" we all love. On this one they have pods with some black goo stuff that does not add any suspense to the film.
The big alien with the broken chest was found inside their ship sitting on the control chair, not inside a human vessel next to a squid like creature.

In saying that, it loses its way almost immediately. Prometheus is a confusing, uneven film with a plot that might make sense, but is beset by characters that make even less sense. An example, the Captain and lead scientist Elizabeth have encountered unbelievable hardships, terror and death, but in the very next scene they're chatting as if nothing has happened. The actions of the android are even more puzzling. Why does he `spike' someone's drink, knowing full well the possible repercussions?  Is it just because of his affinity for his favorite film's main character? Obviously the Three Laws of Robotics don't exist in this Universe. The film eventually devolves into silliness with medical systems that have no knowledge of female anatomy, to self surgery and then into guessing games as to why the aliens seeded our planet and why they're not so happy about it now. Yet, those questions might easily be put to rest if rather than referring to the name of the vessel Prometheus actually refers to the god who brought fire to earth.

It is totally dysfunctional-TOTALLY.  I am a huge fan of Alien and Aliens-I refuse to acknowledge the existence of the mess that followed. Once a story goes beyond it's first initial shot, it rapidly tilts more towards the let's make every last cent before we sink this mutha!
I didn't see it in 3D or at the theater so I was left with what used to be called a movie.  I did watch is on Blu-ray so there was that.
So here is my brief maybe you will read rant, whereby I imagine it making a difference in a galaxy far far away ;)
I will preface it with, I LOVE sci-fi.  I love what CG can do for a film...I actually kind of like the fact that there was part in the film where he could have went CG but used practical(you have to see the deleted/extended scenes).  I think what made a lot of the earlier works of these great directors of the late 70's and early-mid 80s was hunger.  They had to work hard with limited and often reducing budgets and resources(until they made a blockbuster then you got either an amazing next film, or ewoks-ok too easy;) so story and practical effects were required or in the great tradition of cinema, sparse or dark filmography....leaving much to the imagination...who knew WE were actually the best at making these movies ;)
Our brains can smell CG a mile away, although we are getting numb to it so our brains are caring less.  The thing about practical models and effects is you can't fake real...and our brain gets that.  So why doesn't Hollywood?
My fear is that all the good practical guys are slipping away and their trade is dying to CG..I LOVE CG it can do amazing things.  I get that more and more the technology and skills required has come way down(anyone ever watch a show on SCI-fi channel-yeah I know they DUMBED down the name for us...yup fans of SCI-FI...meh.
Please give the money to a thousand smaller less known film makers who are hungry than 1 director who is easy money.(they all make the same movie-WOW where would that go...)

This continues the trend with hip-hop dudes and dudettes, replete with tats, attitude and street language, posing as accomplished professionals.  Of course we have to have a baddy corporate babe, concerned only with profits - no modern 'sci-fi' is replete without that.

4792667,3,B005LAIHY0,"What can I say the title says it all.. (Note there is going to be spoilers in this read at your own risk) Well the movie starts out with a couple of scientists finding a cave with Hieroglyphs from which they come up with a theory that said Hieroglyphs are showing not only our creators.. but some kind of a map to their home world.. from here on it goes up and down. Now for my pluses and minuses.

+ The basic concept and idea of the story is very realistic.. and has been tried to be explained from scientists and conspiracy theorists(as well as some historians) for years. (Of course non of it is true but let's roll with it)

- Basically what you have to believe is we were basically created by something like mutated humans.. (Or maybe advanced) that are basically like us.. unfortunately for the most part.. it seems we were created to be close to lab rats... (Well going by what I saw of this movie anyway)

- While the basis of the story is not bad.. (per say) there is some truly terrible mistakes made by the so called Scientists.. not to mention some pretty stupid dialog on occasions.

= However seeing as to how we have Millions of Scientists, Historians, Etc. that not only believe something close to this story... but love the idea of being a Monkey's Uncle.. (Well Ape.. and Ancestor possible human origin.. proceeds to roll eyes) along with natural human curiosity.. and yes on occasions..stupidity... (and sometimes just having a really bad day) I actually found this believable.. which is one of the reasons this movie escapes being average or bad.

+ This actually has a lot more ties to Alien and AVP then most people think... you get to see an early version.. (Two really) Of Face Huggers(Apparently they to have something like a Queen or at least a Giant.. that originates the Queens.. you'll see what I mean) In addition.. the way the ship is built and where the Live Engineer is found looks close to the Pyramid (Sacrifice Chamber) in AVP.. not to mention the company in the series of movies.. and of course the Robot Crew Member. (Android)

= Really while this is Sci Fi.. there is very little if anything scary about this movie.. and there is enough action to get this by.. but really.. it seems long in some scenes.

+ The Visuals.. (And really if you are just an average movie watcher and not a fan of Alien these are about the only thing that will save this from being a bad movie for you)

So the end result is this... If.. this came out back in the 90's I am sure everyone would be telling you how great this movie is.. even me.. of course I was younger back then.. as it stands now.. this is kind of like a Video Game... you know those Million Sellers.. you heard were the coolest thing since bread and butter.. and you thought it should be by the description.. and the graphics.. then you got your hands on a copy and went What The??

4792668,4,B005LAIHY0,"Hi,

Again, watched this on the Amazon Instant Video thingy in HD.

Worked well. 24 hour rental. I watched it twice. Second time started it 3 minutes before my rental was up. It finished the movie with pausing it once. (When it was over the amazon software made very sure that THAT WAS IT, and kicked me back to the amazon menu view. ;) )

Good special effects. Presented itself as a very balanced movie. Rich in action but not hectic (camera-motion wise) and with a consistent flow. I think I was not not engaged once. I usually am indifferent to most movies and can jump in and out of a movie without regretting having stepped away for a few moments. This one was a nice experience and I would watch it again without question down the road. It's the beginning of the Alien Trilogy (which I learned from a friend because I had no clue...) and that's where it will guide you.

What I would suggest is to wait for a director's cut because as well as this movie has been produced I think there are parts missing that would further enrich the film. And, I am sure that there is something on the cutting table that helps enlighten us further; and hopefully there will be a sequel of equal value. I have not watched Alien but this has made me curious to do just that.",1350777600,,1262,4.312236286919831
4792669,5,B005LAIHY0,I thought this was a great addition to the franchise.  I'm also very happy that there are still two more movies to come in this latest trilogy.,1350777600,,143,4.296296296296297
4792799,3,B005LAIHY0,"I enjoyed the film, but I am writing about the disc quality. I received the disc and it suffered from extreme pixelation of the video. I returned the disc to Amazon (the return process was excellent) and got a second disc, which suffered the same pixellation problem. Given the same problem on two different discs, I looked for a different solution. Turns out the firmware on my bluray player (a Sony BRD S360) needed updating to work with the disc. Works fine now.",1350777600,,465,4.614457831325301
4792800,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'll get the visceral reaction out of the way quickly. I was disappointed with the movie the first time I watched it, from a director who gave us the original ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" plus gripping non-sci fi films such as ""Black Rain"" and ""Gladiator"". The best thing I can say for Director Scott is that I believe the primary problem is not with the premise, which had enormous potential, but in the plot and the line by line writing. But, I watched it a second time the next night, and some of the kinks were ironed out by noticing some lines. Also, the relevance of the Prometheus myth became far clearer, and through it, I realized an important back story explanation which was obscured by the characters' ignorance. Read the Prometheus story before watching the movie and pay very close attention to the opening (and think 2001 opening.)

One indicator of how incomplete things seem is that the very old billionaire, Peter Weyland, is played by a fine middle aged actor, Guy Pearce, but we never see him younger in flashbacks, which were probably cut from the final editing. Without giving too much away, the Peter Weyland character adds very little to the story aside from being the person who funds the mission.

I sensed something was seriously out of joint when the ""away team"" enters the cavernous artifact. After encountering something just a bit squeamish, the geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall) decide to return to the Prometheus (the name of the humans' interstellar space ship.) The remaining team does a fair amount of exploring. Among other things, they see a hologram of the intelligent giants, drawings of whom they found on Earth. they are seeking running from some unseen danger. I saw no clue to what triggered the hologram. Following the hologram, they find the decapitated head of one of the giants (as opposed to the 'aliens' we encountered in earlier films).

The captain of the Prometheus sends them a message that a serious storm is approaching. The team, with the usual annoyingly distracting side efforts which slow them down, reach the entrance and begin driving their vehicles back to the ship. But, and here the train falls off the track, never to return, we find Fifield and Milburn still in the artifact, when they said they were returning to the ship. They found some kind of life which intrigued the biologist. But why didn't the team returning to the ship notice that none of their vehicles were gone. Why did they leave the other two behind? Somehow, the two truants don't get the warning about the storm, or ignore it, so they become stuck in the artifact.

There are loose ends aplenty with the alien fauna on this desolate world. My expectation coming in was that the film would explore the origins of two creatures, the ""Alien"" and the race of the giant pilot discovered by the crew of the mining ship Nostromo in ""Alien"". We meet the giants soon enough, but we also encounter at least three other life forms which have a passing resemblance to THE Alien, but their connection to the life cycle of the Alien is never explained.

I'm entering dangerous ""spoiler"" territory now, so I will not discuss any more of the plot except to say that there are a number of unexplained events. Mysteries are great in the middle of the film, but one expects most of these to be wrapped up and revealed at the end of the picture. Many are not, leaving a huge jumping off point for a sequel to ""Prometheus"".

Part of the special attraction of this story is that the audience knows full well what will eventually happen, so there is a lot of mental ""don't go there"" and ""don't do that"" moments, because we already know what things that look like that can do. The problem with that is that there is too much ""quoting"" from ""Alien"" for my tastes. Most of it is done relatively well, but it becomes more and more obvious as time goes on, and increasingly annoying. There is also ample quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue). There are also some subtle cinematic (visual) quotes from ""Avatar"" and ""Jurassic Park"".

One of the bright spots, aside from the imaginative, well done CGI and cinematography, is the acting, which I always thought was a weak spot in ""Alien"". The crewmen, such as Captain Idris Elba, are spot on (unlike Yahpet Kotto in ""Alien""). Instead of the strong Ellen Ripley character, we have the physically smaller and less imposing archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who sports a convincing English accent as the lead character. Charlize Theron's character is restrained and unlikable. Like both Scott and Cameron's ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", this movie has an android (artificial person) as a principal character, in a role much fuller than in the earlier movies. The only thing which distinguishes 'David', Michael Fassbender's android from Scott's earlier android Ash (Ian Holm, Alien) and Cameron's Bishop (Lance Hendrickson, Aliens)is that David is ever so slightly stilted, somewhat like Data from ""Startrek, The Next Generation.""

I will give this the benefit of the doubt for now, but I found a strong disjoint in the rationale between two early scenes and the climax. I sense Scott wanted to leave plenty of meat on the bone to support a sequel. (In contrast, Avatar is almost totally devoid of preparation for a sequel I suspect I will need to revisit this review after seeing the film again. If my suspicion about gaps and disconnects is born out, I may have to lower my rating to 3 stars.",1350777600,,5546,4.76378772112383
4792801,4,B005LAIHY0,"I enjoyed this film. It's easy to attack, but I think it holds its own. Scott embraces some cinematic illogic that's practically inherent in the genre, so it makes sense within that context.
It's extremely different from the original Alien film. That one was kept simple. This one gets more complicated, but when you open a can o' worms, that's what happens.
I highly recommend the 3-D package (and I don't even have a 3-D set up). It comes with an excellent and lengthy documentary on the making of the film. The documentary increased my understanding and enjoyment of the movie.",1350777600,3,580,4.752475247524752
4792802,3,B005LAIHY0,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't.  It does ""sort of"" answer questions, just not in any novel or unexpected way, and I would have preferred a plot and some character development over the very pretty special effects clearly set up for a 3D release.  I watched it after a Quadrilogy marathon along with ""Planet of the Vampires,""  in which was Scott's inspiration for the alien ship, and which made it suffer by comparison, I think, which is saying a lot since Planet of the Vampires is a seriously ""B"" movie. This is Ridley Scott and HR Giger.  I expected so much more and was disappointed and sorry I'd bought it for my Alien collection, instead of just renting it.  Less effects and better art direction for mood and atmosphere might have saved it from no-plot, no character development land, but there was very little to none of either.  Perhaps Scott will release Prometheus Redemption with these elements, but I won't be rooked into buying it.  At least when you ""have to buy The White Album, again"" you know The White Album is really good. Rent it, if you must, before you add it to your Alien collection.  Perhaps they should have hired Pinback to write the screenplay.",1350777600,,1194,4.599056603773585
4792803,4,B005LAIHY0,"Watching Scott's re-entry into the world of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Blu-ray/dp/B004RE29T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien [Blu-ray</a>] reminds you that there just aren't enough filmmakers around who really believably create philosophically interesting movies, in painstakingly created universes, designed to both entertain and make you think.  It's a treat to see him back in the genre.  Here, his original Alien movie has been used as a kick off point only.  Although, as he puts it, the `DNA' of that movie can be found here, this is not a direct prequel.  It simply happens in the same world, and has some fanboy satisfying nods to the original.  Here, the tone is markedly different, setting out a larger question on a more epic scale... how were we created? If life can be created in a lab, who then is the god?
We start briefly on Earth, where a couple of scientists have found common themes in petroglyphs around the globe, persuading them that these are a map, an invitation if you will, to come visit.  And so this movie is that deep space expedition, now funded by Weyland Corporation represented by the icy cool Charlize Theron.  Of course, things don't work out for the scientific expedition quite as expected once they arrive.  Soon vials of black goo are infecting the crewmembers and creatures start to appear in which the sharp eyed will see links back to Giger's original designs.  Don't go expecting the same claustrophobia of the original however.  Here the canvas is much more open, with sweeping vistas and grand set pieces.  Scott's eye for design is as evident as ever, and the effects uniformly satisfying, not least due to his penchant for creating real sets and props as much as possible, limiting the uses of cgi to areas you might not even realise.  Ultimately though, the movie is most satisfying in its almost arthouse beauty and grandeur in the first half.  As it lurches into elements of action and horror, the tension is never as vivid and the action beats never as shocking as you might expect.  Crucially, some plot elements are just a little fuzzy, and it takes the captain of the vessel to walk in to one scene and in a few sentences of exposition suddenly explain out of the blue what is happening, for things to start to come together.  The nagging questions at the end are mostly deliberate creation of mystery, but there are a few things that are not obvious that perhaps should be, and so the end is not wholly satisfying.
The 3D is actually probably the most satisfying since Avatar, in that it is never obtrusive or distracting, and the extras, ranging from the multiple commentaries, 3 hour 40 minute documentary (in modular format to let you jump in and out as you wish) and myriad of other materials including about 40 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, make for a terrific package.  Certainly watching the documentary was gripping and exhaustively illuminating in its discussion on how the details of the design came together, and the deleted scenes help illustrate some of the ideas that were left on the shelf.. and its nice to find the scene that was intended as a precursor to that scene of the Captain's exposition, to understand it was not always intended to be so out of the blue.
All in all, this is a great package, of a fascinating, though not perfect movie.  Even where it doesn't work completely, the ambition and vision is laudable.  Recommended - 7/10",1350777600,,3477,4.924657534246576

A couple days after watching the 3D version I went back and watched the Blu-ray disc - I was so enthralled by the 3D version that I let myself become too absorbed in some of the effects to concentrate on the movie and had to watch the Blu-ray version to view the movie.

4792888,3,B005LAIHY0,"Probably because I live under a rock, I wasn't aware that this was supposed to be a prequel of sorts to the Alien series. Judging from previews and this being a ""Ridley Scott film,"" I watched this movie with some hope that it would be a slightly artistic sci-fi offering.  Mostly, this is true. The film progresses very promisingly in the first half, with the haunting, intriguing set piece of an Engineer destroying himself to scatter his DNA, a 2001-like solo turn from Michael Fassbender as a puzzling, brooding android strolling around his futuristic ship, and finally an exciting set-up with a team of geologists, scientists, and archaeologists on the verge of investigating the outpost planet of an alien race that has supposedly created humankind.  After the inevitable plot thickening of the mission suddenly being revealed to be clouded with corporate or perhaps darker personal interests from the CEO figure Weyland, the scientists get into sleek spacesuits with egg-shaped helmets and investigate the outpost structure.  All this is done very well, but soon the movie starts to suffer from its provenance:  Alien was essentially an artsy horror flick on a spaceship, and Prometheus shows elements of that as the scientists start to die off in various outlandish ways.  As other reviewers have noted, the people on this ship behave much more childishly and quite simply MEANLY than anyone hired to engage in interstellar space travel would.

Prometheus has some beautiful scenes, an advanced artistic vision in places, and is quite effective at its gross-out moments.  But I felt as though the film wanted it at least three different ways:  classy sci-fi, suspense and horror scares, and philosophical enquiry all rolled into one big-budget behemoth.  Sometimes it's incredibly puerile, which is a shame considering the thought and range of its special effects and untapped acting talent.

There is a theme about whether life itself is important or whether one persons life is important.  Many questions remain unanswered: why did the Engineers want to destroy human life on earth, whether religion had anything to do with this, why was the mission leaders medical pod tailored for a man when she was a woman, why the android was the closest thing to a son the CEO would ever have, and why the captain who was so apt to sacrifice himself was also so pius as to celebrate Christmas before feasting after hyper sleep.

I think that is why there are a lot of bad reviews. When people watch a movie in the theater, they tend to just mindlessly stare at the screen, and most don't pick up on every little nuance. It DID set up for the sequel, which has made some people angry. But the sequel will be an entirely different premise, so this movie DOES stand on its own. If you love Sci-fi, rent it and watch it twice, you won't be disappointed. If you just wanted a big movie, then go watch Transformers or something simple-minded like that.

4793022,3,B005LAIHY0,"Watched Prometheus again a few nights ago (spoilers ahead): it sucked much less than the first time when I watched it in the theater, mainly because of the existence of a deleted scene where the Engineer actually has a brief conversation with old Weyland before commencing to violence. I really hate that Scott felt the need to delete this from the theatrical release in order to, I presume, just make the whole thing more cryptic and mysterious - or rather, just far less comprehensible and enjoyable. Another deleted scene drew out the suspense (otherwise non-existent) of the Engineer looking for the last remaining crew member near the end. No idea why that one was deleted either, as it established a much more deliberate, less haphazard pacing at the end of the film.

Plotholes still abound, and the romantic chemistry (or rather the complete and utter lack thereof) between the two lead scientists was thrown into even starker contrast this go-around, particularly when the gruesome death of one and the consequent hysterical reaction of the other as she witnessed it utterly failed to evince any sympathetic emotion whatsoever. I recall thinking ""I *want* to care, I really do.""

But certain other scenes such as that gargantuan fiery ship falling out of the sky in a slow majestic roll somehow go some way toward making up for the emotional and narrative lacunae. It's just a sci-fi movie after all, not high art nor some grand statement on Life, the Universe and Everything as the ""engineered"" hype would have it. Scott said in an interview prior to release ""This movie is all about everything. I come from the All About Everything school."" Feel free to get over yourself, Sir Ridley! And just let us enjoy your work for what it is.

I should also state that, though my connection could easily have supported 1080 or 720p (I bought an instant rental), for some reason it streamed at a far more degraded resolution. And I could find no way to fix that, as Amazon automatically determines the best resolution for your connection speed (or so they say). Phooey.",1350604800,3,2069,4.838983050847458
4793023,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm going to keep this pretty simple and short. This is just my opinion, I'm sure many people will disagree/agree with me.

For starters I really enjoyed the movie. I think the acting was actually pretty good. I've seen much, much worse acting in movies before. But the acting wasn't really the focal point of the movie, it's all about the Special Effects which look amazing.

I don't know if Ridley Scott's whole premise for this movie was simply to set up a sequel but that is what it seems to have done. At the end of the movie I was like ""what the hell did I just watch? What's the point damnit!"" It sets up a lot of questions. Especially in the whole alien universe canon. I really don't want to add any spoilers. But it's almost frustrating.

Perhaps he's meaning for this to be some kind of stand alone story? Which doesn't make any sense because the plot doesn't wrap up at all. It's literally left open ended. Bah. I'm gonna stop talking about it or I'll start mentioning spoilers.

But because of the openness of the ending it makes what's a really enjoyable movie and leaves you wanting more that makes it a bit of a let down. Without knowing if there will be a second movie to look forward too it's like getting to the bottom of a Drumstick Ice Cream Cone and finding they forgot the chocolate.

It looks like there will be a second one. [...] I think that one will really make or break this movie. The way it's made it just can't stand on it's own. There has to be an ending to all the questions/plot lines it raises.

Bottom line if you enjoy the Alien Franchise you'll probably enjoy this movie even though it's style and pacing is different. But you will leave wanting more. I think sales of this Movie will actually pickup if a second movie is released. As people will want to know what brought it to that point.",1350604800,,1829,4.348973607038123

A space faring alien race seeds seemingly countless planets with life and then seems prepared to return to them and distribute not a bio-weapon, but a biological collation and collection machine. That machine, if you could call it that, is actually a microscopic lifeform with a unique form of sexual reproduction. Unlike the modes of asexual and sexual reproduction known to science today, this fantastic lifeform can breed with any species, of any size, while not only harvesting all of the most beneficial traits of its parents, but also consistently producing viable offspring. An ability of terrifying potential. Given a short time, this chimeric lifeform would essentially unite all living creatures within any given ecosystem into a single hydra-like monstrosity of unimaginable intelligence, complexity and adaptability. I saw the ancient alien race of engineers grand plan not being one of biological extermination, as was postulated by the terrified astronaut explorers, but one which would bring together nature's grand designs from all corners of the Galaxy. Imagine, for a moment, what the result of the fruits of thousands of planets' long evolutionary histories would create if brought together. It would undoubtedly be the birth of an unthinkably complex and powerful being.

Unfortunately for Ridley Scott, this movie is not for religious people, or the scientifically illiterate, and as such it has unduly received a tremendous amount of negative reviews. As for the reviewers using phrases like plot holes, or lack of continuity, these people are either ill informed as to the definitions of these terms, or just small minded, there were no such drawbacks. Prometheus is an epic science fiction movie which juxtaposes human drama with the plans of outstandingly ingenious aliens and the dastardly deceptive robotic children of mankind. Having the overall poetic theme of being careful what you wish for was a delicious dose of classical irony. I didn't expect and didn't dare hope for a movie this deep, this scary, or so utterly rife with intrigue. Five stars.",1350604800,,2097,5.297297297297297
4793027,4,B005LAIHY0,"Even though the show starts out a little slow, and even though there are several plot holes, the show has many intense moments that make up for; specifically the surgery scene.  The visuals and special effects are extraordinary, and the acting, mostly from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender (as Elizabeth Shaw and the android David respectively), is very well done.  The ending is also very well done and is an obvious setup for a future sequal(s).  This show is definitely one of the beginning pieces to the Alien prequal (Ridley Scott confirmed he was going to do more), and even though it leaves multiple unanswered questions, it is definitely worth watching; especially if you are a sci-fi or an alien fan in particular.",1350604800,3,726,4.8861788617886175
4793068,4,B005LAIHY0,"Let me say from the start that the film just looks amazing on the big screen and I am sure that the Blu-ray will do it justice. The special effects are cutting edge and overall fit well into the storyline and the production design is top-notch.

I must admit that I am a big Ridley Scott fan. He pretty much re-invented the ""serious"" science-fiction genre with Alien and Blade Runner and I have loved nearly all of his films since. But overall I was somewhat disappointed with Prometheus.

As others has observed, this does not follow the general formula of the other films in the Alien series -i.e. plucky heroine battling and winning out over one/many Aliens (depending on the film), but attempts to provide an origin story for the Alien creatures as well as an origin story for the human race. This is quite a ambitious goal, which I think the film only partially pulls off.

***SPOILERS***There are several plot points that I found somewhat confusing.
(1) The location of the crashed alien ship I had wrongly assumed was the same planet as from the original Alien film. But no - this is a different crashed alien ship on a different planet.
(2) The large humanoid creatures that apparently seed planets with DNA at the beginning of the film, suddenly decide to wipe out humanity at the end of the film with no rational explanation as to their motivation.
(3) The death of the humanoid creatures shown as a hologram to the science team is unexplained. Were they killed by something mutated from the cargo they were carrying or something else that had invaded their ship?
(4) The Weyland senior character and his android proxy seem to be privy to information on the use of the DNA material found on the ship that none of the science crew have and have a plan to use it to extend the life of Weyland senior by spiking the drink of one of the crew ?? Huh..???
(5) The DNA material suddenly starts to mutate into the snake reptile creatures in the humanoid's ship because the temperature of the room starts to increases! So the humanoids are able to build vast spaceships and have extensive control over DNA, but cannot build good air conditioning??

I enjoyed Michael Fassbender's character which is played with a mix of whimsey and menace and is by far the best part of the film. If there are indeed sequels planned, then I would enjoy seeing development of his character.

Would I recommend someone watch the film? Yes. It is an adult sci-fi film with many good moments and plenty of eye-candy. But comparing this against some of Ridley's other work, I would if possible give 3.5 stars.",1350604800,3,2588,4.6173913043478265

4793070,5,B005LAIHY0,"I couldn't see this movie in the theaters and I really wanted to.  So I ordered the 3D Blu ray and I must say that after watching the movie once, I was supremely disappointed.  I wrote a scalding review here which I have subsequently removed.  I didn't have nice things to say about this installment.  The problem for me was that the story didn't seem to make much sense: actors where doing things that didn't make much sense and the logic just seemed off.  For a movie of this caliber, the actors, the director, the special effects etc.  It just seemed like the biggest mistake of their careers.

Recently I was on a long transatlantic flight and I had some movies loaded onto my ipad.  One of them the classic Dune and another Prometheus (With high anticipation I had loaded Prometheus onto my ipad before seeing).  Long flight, what the hey I played the movie again after watching Dune.

It opened my eyes.  The symbolism was all there.  The movie only makes sense when you look at it through the lens of ancient mythology + ancient christian and other belief systems:  sacrifice, rebirth, survival, motherhood, giving birth, circle of life stuff.  Seen through this lens, the movie is brilliant just like Dune.

I found myself sad that I had taken Prometheus too literally the first time around and that I didn't give proper credit to the writers, directors, actors, and special effects team.  These people went out of their way to create a beautiful masterpiece here and I didn't even ""get it"" at first.  For this I am deeply sorry.

Give this movie a chance.  Almost every scene, every line (even the background lines) and little actions by the actors has symbolic meaning.  The robot's behavior is brilliant when you taken into consideration all of the symbolism.

The challenge is that because they put so much symbolism into the movie, you wind up with logic gaps.  It sometimes appears that the characters are not making rational decisions.  This is quite literally very true.  That's because there are multiple stories being told here.  So you have to suspend the logic portion to get the broader symbolism aspect of the movie.  Maybe they tried to do too much I don't know.

Thank you to Ridley Scott for making this.  Sometimes genius doesn't connect with all of us at once.  I'm happy that I own this movie and I will be studying it for some time - just like Dune.",1350604800,3,2378,4.635491606714628

Prometheus sure ain't for everybody; it's too slow for horror fans, too horrific for art house fans, too anti-romantic and too weird for many in general, and too full of mild plot holes for uptight geeks who don't know how to relax and enjoy truly gorgeous images. But I've been loving Scott's work since going to Alien as a kid in 1979 and for me this is perhaps the perfect summation of many of his themes and the consummation of many of his incredible visual signatures.

The opening of Prometheus is just mind-blowingly stunning, Lord Of The Rings epic but with its own special otherworldly feel. The Iceland landscapes are stunning, and as at various points during the film my jaw literally dropped in true amazement at both the perfection of the framing and the insane depth and color of the blu-ray image. This has got to be the best BD transfer I've ever seen except perhaps Baraka and Up.

Add to that the sort of attention to quality and detail that all good movies deserve on BD, and you've got a disc that's well worth the 20 clams they want here. The dvd is only a sad reminder of how awesome 50gb of BD space can be when used for an image this crisp and a soundtrack this wide and how 7.4 gigs just can't ever compare.

How much time did they spend making this blu-ray good? Well, the movie audio has 28 different subtitle tracks. 28! Including two commentaries in various languages. Even the well-laid out deleted scenes have 18 subtitle tracks. Normally it's a miracle to get one. The Weyland film they made just as an extra is another excellent addition with lots of good ideas the film couldn't assimilate.

But caring about every detail like that is Scott's hallmark, and his exemplary commentary is typically sharp and incisive, with many drily humorous thoughts on the film making process and some great jabs at the moneymen who still don't let him do what he wants, despite a career as fine as almost any modern director's.

The deleted scenes extra shows how wisely ruthless Scott can be as an editor; many fine things were dumped but in hindsight you can see why he cut each one, as good as some were. He wants to preserve the mystery and weirdness that comes with leaving out some details, and he gets so much intense atmosphere so often that he makes most directors seem like they're still in film school.

Whereas the details he leaves in, with many references to his own masterpieces Blade Runner and Alien and also 2001 and other sci-fi landmarks, all work together to highlight the truly interesting central conceit here: the earth as petri dish for people. If you've read much Sitchin you know this idea is rich with possibility and perhaps even probability. Scott plows into it with verve, and the effects and cgi folks do him proud.

There are some cgi scenes here that redefine the art, especially the alien ship cosmos map scene. Wow. Watch that in slo-mo on a good LCD screen and be awestruck. I really wish I'd seen this in an Ima. Sigh.

But movies do not live on images alone, and the performance that really carries the drama is from Fassbender, who takes Rutger Hauer's emotional ice from Blade Runner and warms it up to vapor, saying volumes as the perfectly sly cyborg with wry glances and deft details of movement.

Rapace and Elba certainly have their moments, and no one is weak, but it's the visual splendors that are the real star of this film.

All that said, this is not for everyone. It's too harsh and too slow if you're not totally into the tale, and I could see where it could drag. But if you love sci-fi, the art of film and an epic film maker with a truly unleashed imagination, Prometheus is a delight that will only get better as time goes by.

It also highlights various parallels between Scott and James Cameron in both epic scope and idea (each also chose Sigourney Weaver as his favorite hero archetype---the indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart. This makes his films much more successful, but I think as time goes by Scott's vision is emerging as one of the finest of all living filmmakers. Who else has done a film like this and also (the sadly neglected but wonderfully sharp) Matchstick Men? Now that's breadth.

I've always dreamed of a sequel to Blade Runner, and I guess this is as close as we'll get. And while it lacks BR's once-in-a-lifetime feel, it has a visual sophistication that not only makes BR seem primitive but redefines how wild a movie can look while still seeming real. My eyes are still reeling.

The main qualm I have is the music, which is always big but never deeply memorable like Vangelis' incomparable Blade Runner OST. It's the Giger-esque imagery that haunts the brain most here, and Scott's various tributes and nods to his filmic past make Prometheus a many-layered visual and mental splendor for cinephiles with patience, open minds and hungry eyes.",1350604800,,4926,4.614857142857143

4793075,5,B005LAIHY0,"This 2 DVD package is a perfect example of why you should purchase the set, rather than just viewing online from a streaming service.

The movie is well written, the sets, acting and effects are top level and state of the art.  It leaves one with lots of questions about the Engineers and why each alien doesn't look like the ones we saw in the Alien movies: those questions are answered in a beautiful example of leading-edge technology.

If you have an iPad or Android tablet/phone, you can download a Prometheus app that will link with your Blu-ray player if it supports BD-Live!  As the movie plays, background information is displayed on the tablet including production notes and sketches.  At certain parts of the movie, the movie is paused while a video from one of the producers/directors/special effects editors, etc., is displayed on the tablet. The movie then continues.

At other places, alternate or deleted scenes are added to the viewing experience at the exact place they fit in the film. You have an option on the tablet to skip the experience, but it is worth watching if you truly want to appreciate the time, talent and effort that went into making this film.

The other add-ons on the second disk, including the SD version, Digital Copy and additional resources telling you about the movie are all worth watching. The history of how the movie came into existence is remarkable, as well as how the first Alien movie was completed with a few starts and stops.  The production team and director made it all look too easy and polished when we all saw the first Alien movie...the story is an inspiration for all of us who aspire to be creative, jump hurdles and achieve goals over time.

Noomi Rapace brings the same level of intensity and emotion to her role as she did in the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy. (She was good in Sherlock Holmes too, but the role did not offer anywhere near the challenge of this one.)

Charlize Theron continues to amaze with her acting as a hard-core, highly disciplined, driven...but still-wanting-to-be-a-loved-daughter persona.

Idris Elba does a great job of balancing out Theron's intensity with calm leadership, focus and demeanor: after all, it's Christmas!

Michael Fassbender is both frightening and fascinating as the cyborg with a hidden agenda and a bad habit of listening in on other people's dreams.

Guy Pearce makes good use of his screen time although there is not much of it: his movements and voice, along with remarkable make-up transformed him into a very old man with his own special, but not surprising, agenda.

The rest of the cast does a good job in adding depth and texture to the story line.

For a Ridley Scott film, supposedly in the ""Aliens"" genre, this film is a complete embarrassment. The plotline is absolutely preposterous.  Unlike the first 3 of the Alien series, which were great SciFi films and had overall believable storylines, the Prometheus plot line is downright offensive to an self-respecting, intelligent viewer.  Pathetically idiotic. The supposed ""scientific"" reasoning behind the expedition is preposterous, and the ""scientists"" which compose the bulk of the crew and characters display all the charm, professionalism and reasoning ability of a second-grader with untreated ADD. The dialog is awful. The explanations they provide for everything and anything are mind-numbingly stupid.  The movie somewhat improves during the last half, when they start running around in a panic, things start exploding and people start dying.. but its still pretty bad.

Foremost, Ridley Scott. The name is practically synonomous with something that will entertain you.

And second, who would find fault with a genuine attempt at a good movie??

Okay, there are a few problems, but nothing that would prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this movie. It was awesome.

For factual people out there, there are some very legitimate ""problems"" with our whole history of evolution. What has been taught and thought for the last 100 years has been a questionable enterprise. There are historical sites around the world that call into question some very basic ideas that most of us hold as TRUE. Current underwater archeology has shown cities that are not where they should be. That the 11 or 13,000 years of human activity may actually be a LOT longer. I know, it infuriates some people to think that some of the human history we accept, may be a little off. Or totally wrong, different, longer. Using Procession of the Earth, some very respected scientists are dating the Great Pyramid to an age of 13,000 years (this would be to accurately point the 'holes' directly at those stars, and there's no way to carbon date the Pyramid, so who's to say?).

The point is, that our history IS ACTUALLY a mystery, the greatest mystery. And for someone to offer up a fictional story, exploring an idea is wonderful. No, I don't think that Prometheus accurately tells our historical beginnings, but why not think outside of the BOX? It's the only way we will ever get closer to the truth. The TRUTH, IS INDEED STRANGER THAN FICTION. If anything, I believe that. So go on Ridley, you keep at it, I AM ENTERTAINED.

I am impressed with the story, the cinematography, the characters, the costume design, the sets, the spaceship designs, the alien designs, the CGI, and on and on. It seems like Ridley Scott successfully homaged his own ALIEN movie and at the same time successfully homaged 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The first scenes of the robot/android prowling the ship and the crew waking up feels like a perfect blending of the 2 movies; no small feat. Noomi Rapace is my favorite actor from her role as Lisbeth, and here she plays Elizabeth, and it felt like the movie is her vehicle, she is the ultimate survivor, and her quest could easily become another trilogy. I will mention a few things that I liked, but that could have been even better ( I'm not complaining ): The main CREATOR aliens could have been less musclebound, and could have had female counterparts... I suspect there is more to this story. I liked the tentacled aliens, and they look and move superbly, and I liked that there were 3 or 4 different types in different stages, but it is a bit confusing and not completely coherent, but if this were reality we would not know what was going on anyway so it's ok, the 3 part storyline is not apparent at first viewing, so we are left wondering what does this mean and where are we now, but I caught on quickly enough. I am a little tired of tentacled aliens, but these are done so well and the action is so realistic and so interesting that I love it. the story basically is that a rich guy goes in search of the CREATORS, who look like musclebound albinos. The rich guy and his crew find them on another planet, they investigate, they all become infected with various aliens, Noomi survives, and with the robot she goes on in search of the CREATORS home world. Of course, it is all much more complicated than that. It is also superiorly beautiful. There are fantastic and beautiful special effects, all tasteful and very creative. The characters are good and beautiful to look at. I think there is even an homage to Lisbeth Salander in the movie. And even the character of Elizabeth seems like a continuation of Lisbeth's life, and I am very satisfied with it all. The ship interiors are gorgeous, in fact, so much of this film is gorgeous that I am still impressed. The story, after much thought, is pretty darned good and holds up.

4793224,3,B005LAIHY0,"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Ridley Scott AND of his second feature length film, ""Alien"" which is where the genesis of this movie came from.  What made that movie such a phenomenal flick is the stunning cinematography, story telling, pacing and acting -AND the visuals.  The grittiness of the characters, the tension between them before the movie really even gets going, watching them do their jobs -almost from a documentary style format.  That movie stunned audiences and deservedly so for 1979.

This movie is a sort of ""prequel"" to ""Alien"" -though not completely.  The movie is obviously well filmed, has stunning visuals and effects, like its predecessor.  Now, to me -the acting was... okay.  You couldn't cut the tension with a knife -like in ""Alien"". The movie does, sort of, answer the question of where the aliens came from as well other little questions, like the ""space jockey"" and so forth.

The time line for this movie is supposed to be before that of ""Alien"", though that movie was gritty (it WAS the 70's) and this film is very clean -too clean, almost like a ""Star Trek"" film.  There is no grittiness or realism to the characters -just nothing that makes you think these people could be you, me or anyone else.  To me this is a big issue as in the ""Alien"" film you could actually relate and connect to a degree with the characters.

I admit that I did NOT see it in theaters, and ordered it as soon as it came out on blu ray (got a used copy, even!) so my excitement was high, and I admit that my expectations were thru the roof as well.  I also admit to being disappointed in this film... Scott is an excellent director (Alien, Gladiator, The Duellists, Black Hawk Down, BLADE RUNNER!) but this movie feels too commercial -there's nothing in it that makes me ""dare to want to see it"" like its predecessor. For ""Alien"" there were reports of people fainting, screaming and running out, and throwing up -if you went to see it, you were warned -this film you got none of that.

Look, the bottom line is this: while I have complaints and issues with the film, I recommend it to those enthusiasts of the original ""Alien"" as it is an interesting entry after the fact.  I suggest if you've never seen it, before buying it, rent it -either thru Amazon or Redbox, first -then decide if buying it would be worth it to your budget.",1350345600,,2334,4.5

4793227,1,B005LAIHY0,"***************************SPOILERS ALERT*********************************
I wasn't expecting more of Alien from Ridley Scott, but my expectations were high. However, instead, I was first greeted by grindingly simplistic (and repetitive) dialogue.

The dialogue is not intelligent; it's stuff like, ""What the hell is that?"" and ""I'll be damned"". There isn't an actual hint of intelligence anywhere in the movie.

IN ESSENCE, THIS MOVIE HAS NO SUBTLETY WHATSOEVER.

Prometheus would be just as easy to understand with no dialogue at all. Everything that is blatantly obvious is made painfully obvious by exchanges like, ""I'm going in."" ""Copy that."" ""I see lots of things in this room."" ""Ok good.""
Throughout the entire movie, I felt like the script was written by a 5-year-old. Perhaps the same one who wrote Fast Five and some of the Underworld movies... Except this movie is far more bland, humorless, and self-infatuated than almost any other movie I can think of.

Another contributor to the over-simplicity of this movie is the incredibly stupid, unbelievable characters doing incredibly stupid, unbelievable things in incredibly stupid, unbelievable situations. Scientists hugging hostile aliens, people running in a straight line when they should just walk 10 feet sideways to escape falling donut ships, a terminally ill Weyland going out to meet the mysterious hibernating alien man, Noomi trying to make the audience rage by telling people about her ""faith"" rather than real reasons for the expedition in the first place (not to mention yelling at the alien man about it)... Barf. Can something that makes partial sense PLEASE happen in this movie?

SFX: Great, every single shot has tons of obvious and distracting CGI. This is the same problem that plagued the three new Star Wars movies: superfluous, useless CGI filling up every shot. What made Alien and other movies succeed is the extreme realism and ambience in the environment. Prometheus, unfortunately, went the Avatar route: all visuals with nothing of substance.

Soundtrack: Boring, repetitive, overly ominous. I dislike listing to ominous, overbearing music when nothing interesting or thought-provoking is happening.

Story: Completely inane and childish. No attention is even paid to science, or common sense for that matter. I know it has prevailing sci-fi themes, but the genre for this movie would be more aptly named ""stupid fiction"". There are just too many logical inconsistencies and holes here to be forgiven. E.g., there is no possible way Noomi should be sprinting away from ships so soon after she's had her abdominal wall cut open. It makes zero physiological sense. The whole movie makes no sense to a logical human brain, and there's no excuse for that.

Characters: They suck. Or do they even exist? It's just a bunch of stupid, stereotypical characters who say stupid, stereotypical things. In this movie, people are basically just props for showcasing CGI. None of the characters are likeable except for some of the ship crew. Weyland is a stupid selfish dick, David is a mysteriously motivated dick for misleading everyone else (and he's a robot, making him harder to relate to), Vickers is cold and mean, and the scientists are clearly all stupid dicks. Noomi Rapace's character is just god-awful. She has an annoying accent, an unwavering moon face, and as she continues to muck up the situation for everyone else, her motivation is STRICTLY EMOTIONAL (*facepalm*). Janek, the empty black character, is easily the most likeable and realistic out of all of them.

All in all, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Its only redeeming quality is good CGI, but that fact is easily crushed by the movie itself. I have great difficulty grasping what the writer, director, and actors were thinking when they made this steaming pile of self-infatuated garbage.",1350345600,11,3864,5.22940226171244

4793339,4,B005LAIHY0,"This movie was good but it could have been better. A lot of unanswered questions of course which would lead into another sequel.

Was this a prequel to the Alien franchise? Technically, I would say yes because it did show the Alien mural that Charlie saw in the back of the cave behind the huge stone face and the birth of the xeno at the end of the movie. But what I'm confused at is I that for the xeno to be full grown like it was when it came out of the Engineers body that it had to be the snake like creature that we had come custom to seeing in the Alien movies and then growing by shedding it's skin to full grown Alien. So I was bit thrown when I saw that.

I believe there is lot more in that cave then we realize. Charlie stated that it was another burial site. But for what? When he was behind the head there was a big green stone sticking up like maybe it was a way to unlock a door or something what every was behind that Alien mural. I believe that planet is significant and needs to be further looked into.

And hears something else to think about. Must we not forget about the Predators who hunted the Xeno's. I know that is a whole different story. But they tie into this somewhere along the way.

4793615,1,B005LAIHY0,"I saw ""Alien"" on its release over thirty years ago, and was scared out of my socks.  No doubt there were some glaring holes in the story and some obvious issues with the science and technology on display, but it was an ultra-suspenseful gothic horror pic. With the exception of ""Aliens"", subsequesnt sequels seemed to follow a death spiral of silly ideas and poorly-developed characters.  I always figured that the lack of Ridley Scott's hand at the helm, and 20th Century Fox's ""let's bamboozle the movie-going public with amazing special effects so's nobody notices we don't have much of a story to work with, and maybe we can still make a fast buck"" ethic lead to the franchise's decline.

Imagine my excitement at Mr. Scott's return with ""Prometheus.""

I missed the show at my local multiplex, so greedily anticipated the DVD release. What a let-down.

I spotted too many holes in the story to even try to count'em; the primary characters, while purportedly scientists, act like junior high schoolers who'd spent the two year interstellar flight sniffing glue; none of the scientists and crew was even likeable or vaguely sympathetic, with the possible exception of the ship's captain, or maybe the damned robot (was he evil, or just following Weyland's orders?  Just what was his motivation, anyway?); there are few lines of dialog containing more than five words per sentence (I guess somebody in production figured, ""why say 37 words when one will do?""); the gothic spookiness of the original ""Alien"" was sorely lacking yet again, as was any remote hint of suspense; the authors of the script mustn't know a damn thing (the dingbat biologist character says an increadibly stupid line about ""...three hundred of 'DARWINISM'..."": no biologist would say ""Darwinism""-- that's for TV evangelists.

But I pick at nits.

All-in-all, this cinematic catastrophe, while at times spectacular, represents Hollywood's failure to ""get"" science fiction.  I thought this one might be high-concept, but it's no more high-concept than ""Plan 9 form Outer Space."" If you put enough efx on screen, the studio hacks seem to think, the lumps in the multiplex seats will go, ""OOOOOH, ain't that cool!""  I saw (by accident, mind you) 15 minutes of the latest ""Transformers"" picture, and I was hard-pressed to tell the difference between that one and ""Prometheus"": the look (production design), sound effects (including over-compressed booming noises that pummell us from time to time, sometimes just to remind us to be scared), cgi visual effects, action sequences, even costumes, were from the same mold.

Paramount was able to save their ""Star Trek"" franchise three years ago with that reboot (it has problems, too, but dang, it's Star Trek, ain't it?).  Can 20th Century Fox learn a similar lesson before they release further ""Alien""-ish drek?",1350259200,10,2828,5.097402597402597

so yeah, it was a decent film.. one that i will probably watch again.. but i definitely see why the movie got mixed reviews.  its just from my perspective, it wasn't that bad.  but admittedly, Noomi Rapace is the primary reason for me liking the film.  without her performance, i too would have rated this film 2 stars.. maybe lower.",1350259200,,923,4.308139534883721

I went to see Prometheus with NO idea it had ANYTHING to do with Alien.

That being said: the movie is pretty good story-wise.  The story could have been an excellent stand alone beginning to a completely different universe.  In fact, I was actually annoyed when 'Alien' pops up for the first time in a form that non-fans would recognize in the LAST 3 MINUTES of the movie.  Geez. 0_o You could have warned us.

I like the movie itself, but it raises more questions than it answers.

Also, the humans here make tons of equally stupid choices to those I saw in the snippets of the original alien movies.  (See the Survivalists Quiz 2.0.  That explains most of them.)",1350259200,2,870,4.3875
4793622,5,B005LAIHY0,"The best part of the film is the credits. This is where you see who is responsible for the real creativity, and who is responsible for all the crap.

The genius of the film lies with the more than a screen full of software engineers and digital artists, so one can speculate that each one of them was given a year and 1$ million to each create one minute of superlative special effects, and given today's technology, would be limited only by their imagination. You cannot fault the software engineers for creating the incredible special effects.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if these special effects companies spend all their time creating special effects which they sell to people like Scott Ridley.

So, we all remember the special effects, but we also remember the crap screenplay that still approves of smoking cigarettes by futuristic highly intelligent, highly evolved, trained astronauts who still appear to have a binge drinking ignorant and illiterate view of life better seen in your zombie/vampire movie. A line or two from one of the geologists - i luv rocks, i'm only 'ere for the money. Why doesn't Scott Ridley employ a writer who has the same talent as the computer programmers?

So, what kind of screenplay were we treated to. I can't help thinking it had to be approved by people who believe in God and who have a rather puritanical and prudish view of sex;

The central tenant of the film is somebody other than God created Man. The Hollywood film industry appears to have a problem with this, so it introduces all manner of distractions into the film such as making a big deal of each astronaut's personal egos and aspirations, and will this destroy faith, and of course we can't have that.

For me, there was only one truly upsetting scene and that was the Caesarean operation performed by the patient, and which reminded of when Rambo stitches up his own shoulder using a needle and thread that he carries around with him in the handle of his knife. Next it will be do it yourself heart transplant.",1350259200,,2025,4.690140845070423

4793714,4,B005LAIHY0,"Well, with almost 650 very mixed reviews already on Amazon for Prometheus, there is more than a fair share to help you determine whether or not you should be viewing this via Instant Video, renting or purchasing the DVD. I opted for Instant Video and I think that the movie is so good that I should have purchased it to put in my Blu Ray collection next to my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Quadrilogy/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Quadrilogy</a>.

Prometheus is a must for fans of the Alien franchise. It takes a more philosophical turn than the action-heavy Alien movies, but that's what makes it uniquely great. And don't get me wrong...there is ultimately plenty of action. It's just that Director Ridley Scott and his writing team decided to throw in the ""all important"" controversial questions: Evolution created Man? God created Man? Both??? Prometheus takes a ride down this slippery slope that is sure to get the ire up more from the pro-religion crowd than the scientific crowd.

I'd be surprised if there's anyone here that already isn't aware of the movie's premise, but basically here's what you get: Some scientists/geologists/archeologists discover a clue on Earth to the beginnings of mankind that takes them to a planet/moon that will be familiar to Alien fans. There, they hope to have ""the all important question"" answered. And you know--by at minimum watching the trailers--that the crew get a lot more than they bargained for than just answered questions.

The acting is awesome and the special effects are top notch. I was glued to my seat. I felt that the movie moved at a quick pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the just over 2-hour flick.

Is the movie flawless?...Heck, no. And if you've already seen the movie and you have not read the 1-star review on the front of the Prometheus product page here at Amazon called ""Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!"" on September 23, 2012 by Arthur J Bullock Jr, it is worth the short, accurate and amusing recap of the movie's major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.

My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.",1350259200,3,2331,5.091623036649215
4793715,4,B005LAIHY0,"I really looked forward to this film, for several reasons including the fact it was a prequel to one of the best movies in my collection. I saw the display at the theater last year and had it on my list to buy from that point on. I don't do many movies in the theater. I prefer to buy them later on Blu-Ray and save the money. It's cheaper to own most movies than to take my wife and myself to the theater, and we can watch at our leisure.

While I was waiting for delivery I started reading some of the reviews and found out it left a lot to be desired. It was a good movie, and since I no longer expected it to be on the same level as Alien, I enjoyed it. I try to watch movies for the entertainment value alone, and if it is something I really enjoy then go back and watch to see if I can find deeper meaning and mistakes. Knowing some of this movies mistakes ahead of time made it a little harder to do that, but, it made me understand I should not expect quite the movie I'd planned to see.

That being said, it was a good movie. It was entertaining, it did have some character build out. The affects were great, it was fun to see the ship design, the image of the ""Engineer"" in his control seat with his helmet on that matched what we saw in Alien on the crashed ship. The shape of the ships, the development of the creatures as they assimilated DNA from their hosts. Even the corridors in the base brought back images from the Alien movie.

I recommend this movie, BUT, I recommend you sit down to watch it without the assumption you will be blown away like the first Alien movie did. If you approach it looking for an entertaining movie, you should enjoy it as well.",1350259200,2,1674,4.097560975609756
4793716,5,B005LAIHY0,"OK this is not the cerebral review so many other write. I will just say that this film was intensely great. It delivered incredible visuals. It gave a foundation for the Alien movies. It also created a lot more questions than it answered which for some is a huge drawback. I for one hope to see more in this story line as I hate for the story to end. What's next? I am sure it will be incredible. Ridley Scott certainly has not lost his touch after all these years.

Right down to the female survivor, the android robot who loses his head and still can talk and think like a human, and even the ending made absolutely no sense!  The ""creature"" gives birth to a baby ""Alien"" from the original movies, but the ""creature"" looks nothing like the baby that just popped out of it's stomach!!

4793720,3,B005LAIHY0,"I am going with a three because the intensity of Alien and Aliens was not there. Additionally, the twists of plot were not sufficiently strong enough to meet expectations. Finally, this was the time to tie up loose ends, answer questions from the predecessor movies. It didn't even attempt to answer it's own questions and indeed seemed more intent on bashing Christians for their faith than horrifying movie goers.

Lots of great computer graphics, yes, but this is a Sci-Fi HORROR movie and frankly I never jumped. It was NOT horrific. I have to hold Ridley Scott accountable because he clearly knows what works and what doesn't. Hollywood has got to separate itself from politics. At least they didn't bash or blame George Bush - something a lot of flicks still do to this day.

The cast was fairly seasoned, yet the acting was more horrific than the ""horror scenes.""

The scenes with the greatest potential for real horror seemed to be abbreviated. Showing me odd, gross, weird, disgusting things does not horror make. True horror makes one jump, maybe yell out an expletive, throw their popcorn barrel and/or turn away. The problem is this movies never drew me into the scenes like Alien and Aliens did. In those movies, I was right there with the crew, horrified, running, screaming; as the aliens moved in.

How do you know when a movie isn't working? You find yourself checking email while the movie runs in the background.

Was it worth $3.99 rental?  Yes. The novelty of it being the prequel to Alien makes it worth seeing...once. Would I own it? NO!

The rental did include two bonus features at the end, after the credits --that was a nice extra.

The best scenes were the opening scenes of Iceland and were probably worth the $3.99. Gorgeous land, that! Incredible.

4793781,3,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott takes us once again on a dark journey to an alien planet that may be even darker than ALIEN.  Not only is the planet ominous and foreboding, but the space vehicle itself offers little refuge from the outside world.
Initially planned as a prequel to the ALIEN franchise, Scott decided to explore the origin of man, constructing a bold scenario to offer one possibility.  Parts of the script seem convoluted and while Noomi Rapace generates some thespian fireworks, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is too iconic to compare.
PROMETHEUS  is a visually stunning movie and the creature effects are fascinating and repulsive.  Michael Fassbender as the android David is excellent and Charlize Theron oozes ice as the evil corporate entity.  Logan Michael Green and Idris Elba lend good support, while Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in a small but pivotal role.
Two more PROMETHEUS films are planned which may answer some of the unanswered questions in this film.

A child could have improved the story. The monster had to get on board, the way it does that is just beyond belief. Suspension of disbelief is part of any movie but this one... stretches that to absurd levels. Almost as if they tried to write a script in a week for a 125 million dollar movie. Why the hell would they do that? Totally sloppy. I mean really REALLY sloppy. Did they mix up pages from the round file? Story makes no sense even from the creation point of ""mystery"" view.

The opening scene on ""Earth"".  Needs a bit more explanation. He opens up a can of poison and drinks it.  He dies.  The end. Rush week on planet X! I would think futuristic people capable enough to do DNA engineering would have rudiments of the scientific method down.

That said: Humans this stupid would not have lived to carry their genes into space! And except for the robot, the inarticulate actors chosen as ""scientists"" would have been better cast as members of a futuristic motorcycle gang. Someone else (one star) has gone to great lengths to detail the scientific stupidity of the script. Why, when the filmmakers obviously had a gigantic budget to work with, did they scrimp on professional consultation? Prometheus could have been intelligent and thought-provoking - even moving - were it not for the ignorant script writers. It's pretty hard movie to sit through without cursing at the screen if one is a natural scientist or archeologist (as i am), as none of the basic protocols are followed - or even the dictates of basic common sense! In spite of all this, I thought the movie's premise was exciting and fun, and I even liked it overall by what I thought was a rather graceful end. But hold on!

For me, this was exactly what the franchise needed...a sideways retool, not precisely a reboot, because the mythology is just being more carefully fleshed out.  Alien was a small focus, insular, claustrophobic horror film--perfect in itself, but it left much shrouded in mystery (to good effect.  I appreciated the laser like focus of that film)  This film is grand and broad, with a wider viewpoint than Alien, but it clarifies so many things.... A wonder and a treat.  The special features are exhaustive, and offer more detail than any other than the most absurdly die hard fans could want, from special effects, to casting, to sets, to the fAntastic score.

This movie is touted as a prequel to the Alien series of movies. It has a great story line and a good cast so the movie had a lot of potential. I wind up rating it as a 4 star film but it was somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie. The special effects were very good and the acting was also above average. What lowered the movie in my opinion was the silliness of the script and the actions of the characters.

If you were to write down the 10 to 15 things that any intelligent person would not do in the event of an alien encounter while on another planet and watch this movie then you would see them do every one of them in about 2 hours. What is it with Hollywood that makes them think that having characters behave like this is entertaining?

This movie had the potential to be a 5 star movie as the premise was excellent. The execution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly. I will not list the flaws of the movie here because it would expose too much of the details of the film but to me it dropped the films rating. I gave it a 3 star rating and my wife gave it a 4. Since my feeling was between a 3 and a 4 star I compromised to a 4 star.

The movie is reasonably entertaining it just is not spectacular in its production. It is now where near as scary, entertaining or suspenseful as the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver. It had the same potential but poor script writing made you just wish that some of the characters would die because they deserved to for being stupid.

4793860,3,B005LAIHY0,"I was jazzed to begin with that a new science fiction movie was coming available.

I am guilty of not researching the movie more thoroughly on the web before renting it.

On the face of it, it is not obvious that it is set in the ""Alien"" universe. My first clue was
when I saw the hologram saying ""Wayland Creating better worlds"".

There were some good special effects, but mostly creepy ones. It was not a bad movie,
just a let down that it was going to be horror and not some uplifting plot.

I suppose it was worth renting, but I was hoping for something classy like Avatar.",1350172800,,577,4.26605504587156
4793891,4,B005LAIHY0,"Unfortunately, the trailer gave too much of the premise away.  It was too easy to connect Ridley Scott and the alien ship from the trailer to the original Alien film, which is one of my all-time favorites, for the ultimate connection to come as much of a surprise.  Sensing the connection, I enjoyed watching the many similarities unfold, but I might have enjoyed the revelation more if I hadn't already been expecting it.

That said, all it took was a good measure of suspension of disbelief for me to enjoy the film immensely.  Sixty years of reading good science fiction (and a like period of watching good and not-so-good science fiction movies) has made that surprisingly easy for me.  As did Alien, Prometheus did an outstanding job of straddling the indistinct line between science fiction and horror.  The creatures were onscreen just enough to keep me worried, and the special effects that weren't creature-related were outstanding.

Having bought the DVD, I'll watch the film again.  I'll probably put it on my shelf next to the Alien Quadrilogy with the mental note that the prequel is better than all of the sequels combined.",1350172800,2,1137,4.885416666666667

Additional thanks for the much needed realignment of the SCI-FI universe, saving the ALIEN franchise. I hope you teach another lesson, by making the next installment of Alien, and putting into place stricter guidelines as to who you allow to film any installment of this franchise without destroying it with poor productions. I'm among the very rare and few (old school fans)that actually grew up with the greatest(SCI-FI) movie of all time...ALIEN! I actually seen this movie in theaters when I was a kid. Prometheus is a great Prequel to ALIEN. This movie answered a lot of questions I've always had about the ALIEN movie. However, after viewing this movie, new questions arise. Ridley Scott has once again reset the true baseline of any good SCI-FI movie. This movie is so well written and produced, and there are no dry or dull areas at all. This movie is all hardcore action from the word go. That's impressive! Alien movies are very complicated and can go off into any direction. The Cinematography, CGI effects, props and acting were stunning. SCI-FI movie like this are very rare indeed. This is an A-List movie which you should buy. I recommend blue ray.

4793898,5,B005LAIHY0,"Having read alot of positive and negative reviews I decided to get this movie on bluray today and make a decision for myself.  I have to say from the time the movie started till the very end, I never found a dull moment to be honest!  I think alot of people were expecting this film to be similar to Aliens, with tons of aliens raging about killing people.  I really didn't want to see another similar flick like that, instead I very much appreciated this one, it was rather refreshing to say the least! I know not everyone agrees but it all boils down to our expectations of a film and how we perceive it!

As far as the special edition 2D bluray is concerned, I did have a problem with mines when it started to break up in blocks around 1 hour 28 minutes into the movie. Then the problem got worse and the picture became all fuzzy and froze. I couldn't operate the remote or power it off, so I had to unplug the player from the outlet, power it back on and eject the disc.  I have read on avsforum.com that certain batches of this bluray dvd have the same problem.  I decided to load the regular dvd and continued watching from that point onwards with no issues at all.

I must say despite the problem I encountered with my bluray disc, I will still rate the picture quality as 10/10, and the sound is fantastic as well...10/10. I never had to adjust my volume control like I have had to on some other movies when it came to the dialogue and action.

Here's an update for October 14 @ 3:30 P.M.

Ok! There is a solution I've found for those defective discs! Ofcourse you have all read my dilemma with the bluray disc but here is what I did and it worked flawlessly.

Go to the player's own menu. Go: Setup > BD / DVD Viewing Settings > BD Internet Connection > Do Not Allow or Disable.

You will need to turn it back on after you're through watching the film for your other applications if need be. Hope this helps all of you. Keep me posted, thanks!",1350086400,6,1952,4.220430107526882

As for the movie itself - I went into it without the expectations of it being an Alien prequel, but as a scifi movie made by probably one of the best directors of the genre out there. The plot, suspense and acting are all awful. About the only good thing about this is the special effects, but even they won't wow you.
For the amount this cost to make, you'd expect far better.

4793975,3,B005LAIHY0,"The much-hyped and much debated Prometheus finally makes its way to DVD & Blue-Ray with enough versions to satisfy even those grumpy Engineers! For those wanting the film with no filler, you can get it on DVD or Blue Ray. For slightly more or for the same price you can get the DVD/Blue Ray Combo Pack, or if you're like me and you ""gotta have it all"", the four-disc collectors edition is the best choice.

Prometheus was the very-much anticipated prequel to the cinematic and visual powerhouse that was Alien. When the trailer hit the big screen almost a year prior to its release, I was one of many Alien fans eagerly waiting for the film's release. This one wasn't worth the wait.

What you got were two movies in one. A story centering around the ""Who created us & why are we here"" question, with the Alien story arguably used as a bait-and-switch tactic to extend the franchise's sequel potential. Numerous plot holes and rediculous character senarios turned ""smart science fiction"" into an ultra stylized B-movie that would make Ed Wood proud.

The film delivers on two fronts. Director Ridley Scott's brillant visual mastery and Michael Fassbender's equally brillant performance as David. Like any truley great visonary, Scott demonstrates how 3-D movies(if you saw the 3-D version in theaters)can shine when the technique is used by a master of cinema visuals. The 3-D version of the film, like James Cameron's Avitar, pales in comparison to the big-screen version.

Prometheus is worth the view & purchase, it just fails to live up to its hype. I personally suggest the four-disc version so you can enjoy the total experience. The film unfortunatley, is an unworthy follow up to a classic science fiction film that terrifies to this day. The events leading up to how the famous ""Space Jockey"" was left in the chair with his chest exploded open was all myself and every Alien fan wanted to know. This film leaves die-hard Alien fans feeling cheated more than satisfied. I also suggest you take the great Arthur J Bullock Jr. Scientist Survival Pop Quiz in the Amazon customer review section before you watch the movie. A sticker on the DVD/Blue-Ray box says questions will be answered. Hope the answers are somehwere in the DVD/Blu-Ray extras.

4794169,1,B005LAIHY0,"I have rarely and mean RARELY have ever felt compelled to write a personal view on a film. I am a great fan of really good scifi...this is not it. I own all the major dvds on the major Alien franchise...personally saw ALIENS two times at my theater...when the BIG SCREEN meant that; not those over sized projection screens we are all now subjected to. Those were all awesome films...personally the first two Alien and Aliens kicked, the last two were mediocre at best but workable and had a story line. (also loved Gladiator and own that too; Sir Ridley Scott shined). I am personally surprised this film ever received above a one star rating by any objective critic. It SUCKED..sorry for the venacular.

DON'T READ BEYOND THIS SINCE IT INVOLVES SPOILERS....OR LACK OF THEM.  This story starts with the alleged human god or human ancestor with a spaceship coming down, perhaps after him and then basically he takes some suicide drink, falls off the cliff into water and is dissolved, with DNA strands disbanding in the water he fell into and the spaceship leaves...no explanation what any of that meant..(even later we don't know ever)...Later in the film we discover this weird DNA match to these massive humans or this particular human is brought up to show our possible lineage to them (i am guessing but nothing is every later confirmed anyway). Later this human/ancestor wants to go to earth to destroy earth. (Ending of the film is the other heroes and captain of the expeditions ship destroys the first ship ((the one containing the human/ancestor giant now fighting a large squid type alien)) and inbetween all that are good actors with no script to work with and having multiple different FRAGMENTS of individual stories that in the end never become cohesive. No one can like or have any personal bond to any of the characters because there are too many, plastic, one dimensional characters and too many individual elements that never largely meet anywhere. But on with the story beginning,our expedition ship arrives. No Aliens actually transpire (except the one the ancestor/human fights at the end of picture) but the story alludes (sort of) that these vases found in the caves they explored were aka alien pods. (Yes they went many times to caves and opened up several doors and saw holographs of our alleged alien/ancestors running around the caves and which we chased after them...again nothing is resolved for sure with that or ""explained"" ). Two crew members who chose to leave early run into some snake like creature and begin to tease/annoy it...(strange behavior for anyone, escpecially scientists to teast an unknown alien life form not knowing what it's capable of). These were the same bozos who just earlier became frightened of the holographs and chose to leave the cave expedition party to head back to the home ship.  But now later seeing this snake creature, they almost annoy and aggitate it...to their demise. (ONlY Hollyweird can write such inconsistent BS). Later it is suggested or inferred that this anomoly/area was a product of the military (aliens for biotech warfare is alluded to) and a greedy company to make money who have no moral compass helped in the construction of something...again they constructed what??? We never are told! (geeze does this sound new??) But they sent this party to this rock/planet anyway. David the robot/cyborg is evil then turns kind of good but job is to protects his architect who is this old man who funded this operation. He appeared as a holograph at the beginning of the film and was to be dead long before the crew arrived on this rock/planet and before the major crew was defreezed for the expedition...but lo and behold he is alive (towards the end of the film) and with all the greedy company (motives) and military weapon testing (motives to create something and not sure what???) alluded to throughout the film, the first story line now changes completely and it was REALLY about the old guy (the one funding the expedition)who was looking to avoid death...His fountain of youth he was hoping would be found in the alien ship...Of course that never happened and he and the robot/cyborg David are killed...(well David the robot is decapitated but alive and can speak....geeezze now isn't this new) and the alleged heroine (who got impregnaged by her briefly exposed boyfriend to an ""alien"" microbe)had this weird thing removed from her stomach...that later (towards end of filme)grew and killed the alleged ancestor/father to the human race who also wanted to destory earth(and we still don't know why). Now he (David the robot/cyborg missing his body from his head wants to help her (the heroine of our story...sort of) after she successfully runs from the ship and the evil human god/ancestor now fighting an alleged alien that came from her stomach that grew. This alleged protype alien that looks like a squid (truly national geo has a more frightening large squid photoed than this) and kills this alleged human ancestor/god with some weird tongue going down our alleged ancestor/alien throat that gives birth to a chest explosion with a brief 3 sec view of some creature coming out of the human/ancestor's chest. Now David the now NICE robot/cyborg will take her (our heroine) elsehwere to find the answers to all of this....THE END......I truly wish I were joking but that is it (largely) in a nutshell...I DEMAND my whopping $5 I paid for watching on ""demand"" tv.  Horrible, horrible film and yes Sir Ridley Scott should bow his head in shame to have his name associated with this monstrosity.

4794291,4,B005LAIHY0,"Well if your a fan of Sci-fi, you can't miss out on this one. From the very beginning it plants in your mind that you are in for a ride and you won't be able to get off until it's over... The suspense of being basically being confronted by things very big and beyond comprehension comes on in steps...

There is so much going on once it gets going after about 1 hour in you realize damn, the minute they made contact on this planet they changed history.

The beginning of the movie is very errie and you at already left saying WTF is going on... What have i gotten my mind into lol. I remember the original Alien i never saw it in the theatre too young, but i did see it eventually in the late 80's... In Space no one can hear you scream, but on LV-223 the whole planet will hear you scream... In horror!

**SPOILER**

Once you see the humanoid alien and realize they are malevolent you really take a blank in your pants, because as powerful as they are, they turn out to be nasty heartless cold killers.

There is a twist that actually turns out that they have been on a mission to destroy humans on earth and that's because we are a failed experiment, WE are them but only WE aren't as ruthless as they are and in fact we actually have compasion and conscious something i think they did not want in their genetic manipulations, so we had been deemed failed and should be exterminated, i also get the feeling that humans {the one's with compasion} pose some sort of threat to them... I think they had planned to exterminate humans when they saw the direction they turned, cooperating living together in peace (for the most part), helping each other. I think humans were supposed to be them only in our part of the Universe... I think their whole goal is to put themselves all over the Universe. The only cliffhanger is what happens if they conquer the Universe? What then? What is their ultimate goal? The next 3 movies hopefully will shed some light on this mystery...

I can tell you i actually felt uneasy in the first contact scene toward the end of the movie... I always had an unsettling feeling about that Space Jockey in the Pilots seat of the Alien ship from the first movie, and once this scene plays out it's like knowing you should not look under your bed and when you do B A M ! Your were right! Why oh why did you look under the bed!!! LOL

The Alien wakes up after being asleep for 2000 years! Then it proceeds to kick everyone's @$$!

The Alien also had in one scene an evil aggressive malevolent sarcastic grin or grimace, almost an internal hatred of the Humans you could feel it. You could actually feel it's mission, it's detestment toward the humans... Terrible and EPIC at the same time!

Warning to you if you haven't seen some of the best SCi-fi horrors, like Event Horizon, or Saturn 6... Bewary this might mess with your mind.

I loved it! It pulled no punches and is as horrific as you could want!

The story unfolds as people seek answers and react to the answers they receive.  Some are disappointed. Some are harmed.  Some are inspired to seek more. I thought it was a clever examination of human nature and the lives we all lead.  Some will say I am reading too much into it.  I doubt few Christians will feel that way.

4794436,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm reviewing the 4-Disc Collector's Edition.  I'll go through each disc individually to give you an idea of what you'll be getting, and which version you should purchase.  But first, let's briefly discuss the movie itself.

If you haven't seen the film yet, you're still probably aware of the polarized reception it received.  Some love it, some hate it.  Instead of giving you another opinion on why it's the best/worst film ever, let me tell you what to expect.  PROMETHEUS is not a horror film.  Certainly it has structural similarities to ALIEN, and there is one scene that I would consider very ""stressful.""  But overall, the film is what I would classify as a ""concept drama.""  That is, a drama that doesn't focus on characters, but rather on concept.  Don't let any of the tense trailers fool you, this movie was meant as a discussion piece, not an adrenaline rush.  You can decide whether it succeeds or fails when you watch it yourself.

Onto the discs ...

DISC 1 - 3D Blu-Ray (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)

A lot of critics commented that PROMETHEUS had some of the best use of 3D they have ever seen.  I don't know that it fully delivered on what I was expecting, but here is my take on the 3D presentation seen on this disc:

1) 3D isn't used as a gimmick where things jut out of the screen at you, which is a plus in my book.

2) There are a few sequences that look absolutely gorgeous in 3D, usually involving holograms or ""projected"" images.  I also think that the medpod scene benefits particularly by the use of 3D.

3) I feel like the depth of the 3D was under-utilized.  Almost everyone seems to disagree with me, but I felt that throughout most of the film, the 3D was a bit flat.  That being said, if you prefer 3D, you should get this disc in order to fully appreciate the aforementioned scenes.

The image quality was near perfect, and there were no noticeable signs of ghosting on my TV setup.  Audio quality was fantastic, the mix sounded nearly identical to the 2D disc, so I'll comment more on it in my review of that disc.  Subtitles are also included.

DISC 2 - 2D Blu-Ray (AVAILABLE IN ALL BLU-RAY VERSIONS)

The image quality here is near perfect.  Most important for me are the blacks, which are quite striking on this transfer.  Definite reference quality material here.  As far as audio clarity goes, it's spot on.  The dynamics are up to a bit of interpretation, but it is worth noting that the speakers are seperated with precision.  And there aren't any silly choices made like dialogue coming only from the front speakers, or the back speakers being dedicated exclusively to music.  Subtitles are again included.

The primary draw of this disc, apart from the film itself, is the surprisingly large wealth of bonus features.  We have two audio commentaries: one by director Ridley Scott, and one by the writers.  In addition, there are more than 30 minutes of alternate and deleted scenes (although many scenes have incredibly minimal changes) with optional audio commentary, and The Peter Weyland files.  The Peter Weyland files are comprised of four videos (created for the express purpose of promoting the movie) that play very much like deleted scenes or webisodes.  None of the content is necessary to understand the film, but they certainly help give further context and depth.

For any casual fan, this disc includes all of the elements comprising of PROMETHEUS's ""canon.""  So unless you want a 3D copy of the movie, or are into bonus features, the standard Blu-Ray release should be more than satisfactory.

DISC 3 - Blu-Ray Bonus Disc (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)

As far as completionists go, this disc is solid, if not perfect. I was hoping that FOX would come out with an extended cut of the film to be released six months down the road, but this seems to be the definitive home video release for the foreseeable future.

The good news is that it's the most COMPLETE wealth of bonus features I have seen since the transition of home video to the Blu-Ray format.  From the ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary, which performed beyond my wildest dreams, to an incredibly massive collection of pre-vis sequences, artwork, stills, storyboards, promotional content, and more.  (I love when they're willing to include marketing material like trailers, tv spots, and posters, because those so often shape our opinions of the final product.)

So why do I think that the disc is imperfect?  Because there is more content that we were told that we would get that we're not getting.  In an interview, Ridley mentioned at least one deleted scene that we're not getting here.  We were also promised an early version of the script, while the film was still a hardcore ALIEN prequel.  That was supposed to be on the ""second screen"" app.  Due to ambiguous legal reasons, that's not happening.

(On that note, the second screen app is an interesting idea, but isn't necessary for a complete viewing experience.)

DISC 4 - DVD + DIGITAL COPY DISC (AVAILABLE IN BOTH BLU-RAY VERSIONS)

This is a bare bones version of the DVD and includes a digital copy. It doesn't include any of the special features that are on the standard DVD release, but those are all included on the 2D Blu-Ray disc anyway. The advantage I see with these combo packs isn't that I need to watch the same movie on a billion different devices, but if I currently have only a DVD player, and plan on upgrading to Blu-Ray eventually, I can buy the special edition now for only a few dollars more than buying the DVD on its own.

Both the two and four-disc version comes with an Ultraviolet copy of the movie IN ADDITION to the standard digital copy.

[EDIT AS OF OCT. 21st] Some have reported macro-blocking and various other issues with the 2D Blu-Ray disc and the Extras disc.  Not all copies are affected, but if yours is, and you don't wish to exchange your discs, you should be able to fix it by turning off your Blu-Ray player's internet connection.  It apparently has something to do with new copy protection protocal.  In addition, there have been reports of these discs working well after updating the firmware, and/or on different Blu-Ray players.",1350000000,596,6173,4.694599627560521
4794437,1,B005LAIHY0,"Firstly, I want to start off by admitting I am an Alien Fanboy, a fanboy of kittens and freakn proud of it.  Alien and Aliens still top my list as Sci-horror at its absolute best.  But these astute opinions and the fact i love kittens have nothing to do with my review, since I walked into this movie actually not wanting another Alien/s or another kitten for that matter, but wanting to explore the dark universe Alien resides in and even darker motivations of Weyland Corp.

You see, in all the Alien movies that came before Prometheus, Weyland was always the hidden motivator, trying deftly to get their hands on what could be the next biological weapon to sell or what-have-you and would stop at nothing at deceptively trying to reach that goal; Ripley's kitten knew what was up boy, believe, cats are smart like that.  But with that and the constant threat of just how dangerous these creatures were (not kittens, but can be if irritated) made the first two movies so freaking awesome.  However, Weyland was never the prime focus of the movies, they were always secondary or an offshoot which helped create tension (a who's worse scenario, the creature or the corporation?) and thats fine, but ultimately this is why I just could not wait to see Prometheus.

Now, turning to the kitten in the middle of the room, Prometheus or better yet, Ridley Scott, because in my mind, its not Prometheus's fault its bad, its the direction/editing/story thats at fault here.  Ridley that ol' kitten hasn't made a decent flick in years.  Movie studios keep handing him all the ingredients to make a delicious chocolate cake, but what we get looks good, but tastes like crass.  This saddens me since some of my favorites have come from this guy (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator to name a few).  But all storys must adhere to what is invariably called ""The Formula"" and without getting into too much detail, the term coin's a tried and true set of rules that are to be applied to create a successful story arch.  In this process, character or protagonist development takes place, motivations are layed out, stimulus is applied so that as the audience is viewing the movie can emotionally unite themselves with a particular character or overall campaign the movies story is attempting to tell...emersion...to which Prometheus attempts, but ultimately does neither, which I find inexcusable from a veteran director with a resume as long as my kittens tail.

With that said, Prometheus as a story took ""the formula"", crumpled the process up into a ball and tossed it right into the garbage.  Sometimes this works, however, the rules still apply.  As I sat and watched the first half hour I was like ""Ok cool, we're going to a distant planet to try and make contact with kittens"" - queue a cornucopia of cool looking visuals - ""we're there, and it looks awesome"".  Next, we've landed and immediately want to go explore (something I'd do presented with cool new planet to explore, but I digress) awesome, jump right in...BUT WAIT!!!....WHO ARE THESE FREAKN PEOPLE IM SUPPOSED TO BE CARING ABOUT?!?  The movie jumped from one thing to another without taking a breather to flesh out your characters, maybe contemplate why this wouldn't be a good idea to adequately build the tension of what might happen to our happy adventurers.  This is the alien universe mind you, never know what kind of kitten is lurking around the corner...especially in the dark.  Alien built the tension slowly with expert precision, Aliens didn't have to do much at all since the story was a continuation of the first only with new kittens to kill (unfortunately) but Prometheus was back at square one, looking in a new direction, asking new BS questions which couldn't even explain or execute even at the fundamental or elementary level.

But no, happy adventures continue adventuring, never skipping a beat, so when they start dropping like kittens, boyfriends get executed by way of hot woman in spandex wielding a flame thrower, you're left asking yourself, ""why am I supposed to care again?  Was my attention supposed to be on hot woman doing her captainly thing by protecting the ship or the fact boyfriend died?"".  If the story adequately fleshed out these characters, maybe I could have been faced with a conundrum, BUT I WASN'T, I was emotionally cold either way.  I wouldn't have cared if flaming boyfriend mustered the strength to flop down on hot woman to see them both burst into rainbows and flaming kittens...as cool as that thought would be, the point is I just didn't care about either character in any particular sense.

...this is the stories fault and by extention, the directors fault which continues to hapazardly piece scenes together without so much as give a flying kitten about substance all the way to the very end which I won't spoil, but I sufficiently didn't care about that either.  Oh the substance is there in a very shallow sort of way, but at the end of the day, the only thing I did care about was the fact I just wasted $25 dollars on this drivel and my high hopes thoroughly extinguished sans end of ACT2.

So can I recommend this movie?  I absolutely cannot to anybody who cares about story.  It certainly wasn't the acting talent, the actors however weren't even given a chance to put their talents to any particular good use with the exception of Michael Fassbenders - David the android...he did good.  However, if you get capitvated by big shiny things and pretty vista's like Transformers 2 - Revenge of the Kitten, I think this movie was made for you.  It's actually better than Transformers 2, but the very fact I'm comparing it to Transformers 2 is not a good thing.

4794438,3,B005LAIHY0,"Many of the fans of the original Alien film were disappointed with the film, and with good reason.

The film, despite some great effects and reasonable acting from a couple of the actors, and a score that's fitting if unmemorable, is let down by the utterly atrocious writing and choppy editing. The plot is unnecessary and full of plot holes.

So with all that in mind I tried to enjoy the film on it's own and no reference to the original, and was left still wanting. I just hope the inevitable Director's Cut will plug some of the holes, and tidy up the editing.  It won't improve the acting, nor can it help the ridiculous ""genesis"" plot.

The Blueray pack comes on three disks. The 3D version is nice and subtle most of the time, so not too obtrusive. The Extras are a nice touch, but don't get your hopes up for an alternate beginning and ending. There are some extra scenes and alternative dialogue, but make little difference to the original version. For once I agree with the ending scene being cut, but the beginning, perhaps, better explains how things all started.

But in truth I don't think the extras warrant the extra money, unless you are a completist and need the 3D version with the extras that you'll only want to watch once.

4794440,1,B005LAIHY0,"The visual effects were stunning in Blu-Ray, but the story went nowhere - pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind; another is contrived.  The Promethius plot is what I would expect from a low budget horror movie - this one just has better special effects.

I could not identify with any of the characters.  Perhaps it is too much of a stretch to believe that all the highly trained and carefully selected scientists and crew would act like incompetent fools - they seemed bent on their own destruction, without any rhyme or reason.

Perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel?  If that is the case, the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double - not an acceptable proposition - a movie must stand on its own, or be marketed as a series.

If you want a fun Sci-Fi movie with alien life forms, watch District 9 - that is much more satisfying on so many different levels.",1350000000,108,997,4.511111111111111

4794444,3,B005LAIHY0,"Story line conception holds great potential for sequels. As many other reviewers have said, the story and the scale are epic. This is beautifully shot and rendered. The 7.1 audio is very well done.  Unfortunately, the character development falls short and the plot line is handled with unconvincing choppiness. Much of the story and plot feels forced rather than letting it unfold. Many of the reveals are obvious and lacking suspense  while others never come.

I suspect that there was a great deal of content left on the editing floor in order to get the final release out the door. If true, maybe a future director's cut would allow for much needed continuity and fill in some of the glaring holes in the plot. That would be quite welcome and allow this film to go from pretty good to great.

Overall, it is definitely worth seeing and owning, given the extremely high production quality and strong sci-fi concept. But it is a shame the actual characters (with the exception of the two key characters) feel like placeholders. The storyline does very little to engender much empathy or engagement of most of the crew.

Visuals aside, the most redeeming aspect to this movie is the thought provocation it evokes. High marks for exercising gray matter. While clearly more in the open question camp than clever answer, it does foster one to consider some very interesting concepts.",1349913600,2,1380,4.85531914893617
4794485,2,B005LAIHY0,"I just watched this a few days ago. There are plenty of reviews giving you all the details on why this is so bad. I will add just a little bit.

This movie is neither original nor rational. The crew act without the least bit of common sense or reason. You figure on this kind of mission they would have some procedures. Not this gang who stumble along from one disastrous mistake to next. Maybe they should have watched Andromeda Strain before heading out. It might have taught them a bit about how to go about examining alien life forms. It has all the dumb things I have come to expect of big budget. There is special effect; people with attitude; the required chase; plenty of gore and of course the naked lady running in distress. In other words it is a very typical Hollywood movie.

On the plus side it is not the absolute worst movie I have seen. Thanks to the non stop stream of garbage being produced it misses that. Therefore it gets a 2 and not a 1.",1349913600,10,960,4.269230769230769
4794486,3,B005LAIHY0,"I have to say that I'm very disappointed to find out that this movie has the horrible ASPECT RATIO of 2.40:1.

WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:
For those of us who already hate the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible ""Black Bars"" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.

Usually I don't mind those ""black bars"" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.

SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?
Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like Wrath Of The Titans, The Avengers, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.78:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.

With that said, This movie unfortunately does NOT support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it NOT worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.

Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"" .

ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:
I did like this movie when I went to see it in IMAX 3D, I think that was the best way to see back then, now that is on 3D for home viewing...not so much unless it gets re-released with the ""proper"" Aspect Ratio.

STORY:
The Story is not groundbreaking as it certainly leaves more questions than answers opened...but it's not bad at all, I enjoyed it.

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
The Special Effects were really good in my opinion, it certainly makes you think you're in a different world far away from Earth.

ABOUT THE 3D Elements:
Although this movie was made with 3D in mind, it doesn't take full adventage and capabilities of the 3D technology as it should have been done, that alone the ""Black Bars"" found in the 3D Bluray version will ruin the experience even more.

If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie might not do justice to the 3D part of it, and that alone just think on the bluray 2D version instead.",1349913600,2,2426,4.347345132743363

With any fantasy movie, and this is a space one, you know that it can't be taken too seriously, but at the same time the story and events have to be somewhat credible, otherwise they becomes ridiculous. This movie vacillated between the believable and the ludicrous. However, I was willing to accept the ludicrous things, like the absurd lack of the characters' caution at every turn, because without it, they wouldn't get into danger and there would be no story.

There were other unbelievable things that were just annoying, mostly to do with the attempts to predict technology that could be conceivably developed by the movie's 2090s setting. Most were fantastic but could be reasoned to be possible, but at the same time for they were displayed next to characters and things firmly set in the present, like eye-glasses, or balding or really low-tech weaponry, such as a WW2 flame gun.

Like another reviewer, after watching the original Swedish `Dragon Tattoo' series, I had great expectations of Noomi Rapace, which were wholly unfulfilled.

Nevertheless, with all its flaws, Ridley Scott  knows how to put a movie together with sound and pictures to produce tension and excitement and I think he's succeeded again.",1349913600,,1366,4.973684210526316

Given that Prometheus is set before the time when the alien to which we are accustomed actually exists it is indeed puzzling why a certain scene early in the movie --at 39:52-- contains a certain mural which depicts, inexplicably, the alien to which we are accustomed. I watched over and over again to be certain I wasn't hallucinating. Alas, there 'twas in vivid detail, thus rendering Prometheus chronologically incomprehensible.

This along with the film's other faults has disappointed me terribly. What has happened to the Riddler who made the original Alien, and Legend, and Hannibal (I know, but I love it so.)? He has frighted me with false fire. He promised me a gem with Prometheus and instead threw a pot of paste in my face.

And don't bother listening to his audio commentary.  It is a truly disturbing experience.  When the Riddler isn't narrating the film like an audio track for the visually-impaired he's indulging in the most contemptible, the most vulgar self-congratulation.",1349913600,4,1455,5.174468085106383
4794493,5,B005LAIHY0,"The controversy and criticism of ""Prometheus"" pretty much centers on two things: 1. Movie fans expected a straight-up ""Alien"" prequel, complete with queens, face-huggers, and worker aliens, and 2. The film does not have a neatly laid out, simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays. Director Ridley Scott decided to go his own way, not taking the easy and simple route. The result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions. Lost by the critics is Scott's examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins.

Prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on Earth, as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities. Human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years, but the universe is billions of years old. The foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of Peter Weyland, who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death-and to profit by whatever else it found.

The fact that the Engineers in Prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we don't know. The universe is vast beyond our comprehension, and the world Ridley Scott creates in this film, with it's monsters, spacecraft, and buildings reinforce his plot device. The ending of the film, with the robot David and Dr. Shaw leaving LV-223 in the Engineer spacecraft, tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered.

Think about it! Humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel; we've only landed a few men on the moon, and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system-which constitutes a tiny portion of the Milky Way galaxy. We humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean-but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!

It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here. He assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking. Many critics condemned ""2001"" and the original ""Alien"" for the very same things people are saying now; they weren't easy to understand, they didn't fit into established categories, etc.

""Prometheus"" thus fits into something the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said 2400 years ago: ""I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance."" Scott asked us to open our minds, and see beyond the usual formula stuff. It seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads. That's okay. I'm quite willing to go on the journey.",1349913600,5,2821,4.784394250513347
4794494,4,B005LAIHY0,"The 3D rendering of this movie is not that great.  I have several top 3D blu-rays as reviewed by Keith Niemeyer which are much better.  Even though Prometheus was shot with a 3D camera, the depth of field just isn't very apparent in most live-action shots.  The occasional object thrown into the foreground seems forced and is often more distracting than integral into the overall scene.  Disappointingly devoid of significant 3D effect are the opening scenes of the planet's landscape and the landing approach of Prometheus.  The 3D effects are most evident in scenes with CGI such as the mapping of the tunnels as shown on the bridge of the Prometheus and text overlays.  Still, for $5 more than the basic blu-ray version of this movie, I would say this 4-disk version is preferred:  both for the 3D disk and for the special features disk.",1349913600,2,841,4.758620689655173
4794584,4,B005LAIHY0,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would categorize it as an instant sci fi classic for the home collection.

While there are those who enjoy finding fault in the details, I allow myself to be pleasantly entertained by the fantasy.  Known physics render sci fi movie plots impossible. Seems silly to accept that light speed is real but assume future medicine can't allow a woman to have an alien surgically removed then go all ""warrior princess"" a few minutes later.  For all those who want to get picky....  this movie can't even be prequel.  If the Prometheus crew left earth about seventy years from now and traveled 2.5 years at faster than light speed (Wyland files on BlueRay disc reference ship's FTL drive), then the Aliens saga as we know it from the first movies would have concluded hundreds of thousands if not millions of years before Prometheus even lands on that Engineer's moon.  Time becomes infinite at light speed.  Even at near light speed 2.5 years to the crew might be millions of years to everything outside the craft.  Assuming the Engineer traveled back to earth to destroy us(yet another million or more years in the future) I think he might find his old-school tech laughable to us our highly evolved society.  So don't let the ""that's not possible"" or ""that's stupid"" arguments deter you from kicking back and enjoying the ride.  I choose to let Prometheus deliver.  I hope you do too.

I will say this... the extended/deleted scenes should have been better integrated in the blue ray edition.  They are viewable separate from the movie and add a lot of wonderful context about the opening scene and offer a dialogue between David and the Engineer.  All of which were cut to satiate momentum.  I would love to have the option of seeing them included in the main movie.  Maybe the director's cut will suffice.",1349913600,,1836,4.744479495268139

Which is just the name of the ship by the way, a ship that is not shown to be special in any particular way other than it can travel super long distances through space, 3.74 x 10 to the 14th, to be exact, or 37,400 Billion miles, but that doesn't seem particularly special in this world, basically it's just a matter of money. So why they named the movie after the ship I have no idea. The second problem is, nobody does anything, nothing really happens till the very last 5 minutes (which I won't give away). So why put Charlize Theron, Guy Pierce, and Idris Elba, who is great actor, but is so bad a doing an American Texan accent it's ridiculous, distracting and comes out sounding like a bizarre combination of all the caricatures he's heard in the past, Mississippi/Texas/Louisiana, with a bunch of his own British Cockney (aka Michael Cain) thrown in. These are great actors Pierce was nominated for Momentum, and Theron won for Monster, it was as if Scott knew he had a nothing movie and called in a bunch of favors.

It's a shame, because I found a few of the ideas and graphics to be bordering on stunning.

Do I call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought it'd be? What about the epic 7.1 soundtrack and score? The ferocious Noomi Rapace? The synthetic David? The fact that the Prometheus ship looks like a Firefly on steroids? There are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting. Here's the film AND the BD review:

This IS an ALIEN movie. We are watching the start of it all. While the film takes place in the same meta-plot, it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs... maybe with a dose or two of Cthulhu mentality - tentacles a plenty.  The BD release has some great features by way of deleted scenes (some that might have done better to have been kept in the film), commentary tracks (Ridley Scott pretty much narrates the film, but it's not as bad as it sounds; he gets really excited about this film), and a background featurette that focuses on Wayland. The visuals are amazing on an up-to-date BD player, and as I said, we get the treat of 7.1 (which shook my apartment, literally, at normal volumes; so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a 'normal' volume). It's overpowering at points, but it sounds great despite the heft of it.

Enjoy this for what it is - a long awaited reunion to the Alien epic universe. We're just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the Alien franchise. Where does that leave us?

Where else, but in the trusted hands of Mr. Ridley Scott. It seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film Prometheus. We're getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over 30 years. Key word there - some.

I've waited this long; the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus. Beautiful. Epic. Eerie. And more than a little... alien.",1349913600,9,2137,4.4832904884318765
4794592,4,B005LAIHY0,"This movie was great. And I'm beginning to be a fan of 3D movie. I just got a TV about a month ago that supports it. So I go this one on 3D only because it was $24. Seems like a normal Blu-Ray price.

The 3D was very easy to watch. I feel Scott did a great job with it. I watched the Avengers in 3D as well, and there were a few shots where my eyes were strained trying to figure out what I should be focusing on. I didn't have that at all with Prometheus. The entire movie was easy to watch in 3D. Just enough depth to tell what was in the foreground, and background.

The movie itself was really good. The first 50 minutes or so, I just kept thinking that they don't make movies like this any more. The attention to detail with the sets was awesome.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars because there were some things in the movie that I just wasn't sure what the point was. It just didn't feel like it belonged. But overall, this is a very enjoyable movie. Turn up the surround sound, turn down the lights, and just enjoy.",1349913600,2,1019,4.034653465346534

For a laundry list of what's wrong here, you can read the other in-depth reviews, but the image of  a couple of the main characters trying to outrun the path of a rolling spacecraft instead of dodging  off to either side pretty much sums it up. The most ineptly manned trillion dollar mission ever.

This film also underscores just how important a good soundtrack is.  Go back and listen to how effective the soundtrack to the original ""Alien"" film is in supporting the awe, suspense and horror of the visuals.  The soundtrack for ""Prometheus"" just doesn't cut it.

Though I will watch this movie again for the sets and cinematography, it's too bad ""Prometheus"" has more in common with ""Alien Resurrection"" than Ridley's original classic.",1349913600,5,792,4.822222222222222

4794767,2,B005LAIHY0,"As stated in my title, the only word I could come up with was ""unneeded"". And I am an AVID scifi fan as well as a HUGE supporter of remake/sequel/prequel modernizing of predetermined storylines. There was alot that couldn't be done in the originals of almost ALL the epic and genre setting scifi films, which took away alot from the experience. Such films as the Star Wars Saga, the Aliens Quadrilogy (which is also associated and tied into the Predator franchise and storyline now), the Terminator Story Arc and just about anything else that was mind blowing 22 years ago or more is now just a joke compared to modern film. Characterization in scifi genre'd films is richer and more colorful now, not to mention the visualizations and music scores almost acting as main characters to the films themselves. You will never find ANYONE who supports modernizing a project more than me!!!

With that said, this film couldn't have been any further off the mark. Charlize Theron phoned it in (or I hope so, because she was worse in this than she was in ""The Astronaut's Wife). The accent of Noomi Rapace was so thick, I couldn't understand 90% of what she was saying. Scott tried WAY TOO HARD to wedge this story to fit one or two stories away from the original Alien, so much so that he lost all traction with what started out to be a very original story! I won't get into the canon mistakes that were made when the story is held up against the 4 previous Alien films and the 2 Alien vs Predator films, but needless to say, there were ALOT mistakes(if you go against canon, you start to erase the story, and you WILL lose fans that way, which is obviously what is happening here).

You should definitely give this movie atleast one watching. It is very entertaining (albeit predictable as all hell), and just visually STUNNING!!! It has some suspense. VERY GRAPHIC surgical scenes (which I could not watch). It's good to have under your belt, especially if you're like me, and want to have ALL CANON locked into your brain. I honestly hope that they go through with making the next film (which they leave it open for) to fill in as the OFFICIAL Alien prequel.

4794771,4,B005LAIHY0,"I say kind of because it is not a direct prequel.  You do not see tons of Aliens running around on the planet.  I would best describe the story in Alien as an offshoot to this one.  There are certainly elements of Alien in the film, and you can see where Alien picks up after this. If however you are looking for a story that leads right into the other movie, this is not it.

Taste in a movie like this will be totally subjective.  If you are not a fan of Alien or Aliens (or similar movies) you are probably not going to like this.  As I said before, if you are looking for a direct tie in, and are expecting it to be exactly like Alien, you will probably be disappointed by this.  This movie does have its own story apart from the Alien aspect which, if another movie is made, will likely be the focus.  If you read any of Ridley Scott's comments about the film before it came out, you can tell what he meant after seeing it.

As for the story, it is really about the origins of humanity.  I will not give too much of the story away, but it explores the possibility that humans were created by a race called ""Engineers"" seen briefly in Alien as the dead Space Jockey.  The ship travels to what the crew thinks is the home world of the Engineers only to find them gone and clues to what happened to them.

It definitely sticks to some of the horror and sci-fi movie cliches.  There are stupid decisions made left and right by the characters, and if those kind of things bug you about a movie, this one will too.  There is not a lot of character development (not that there was a ton in the original movie either) so you do not really find yourself rooting for anyone.  I do think it is a solid enough story that if it is continued it has potential to be very good and go in a lot of different directions.  If you can look past the weak points and not set your hopes too high on the Alien aspect of the film I think you can still find this enjoyable.",1349827200,4,1951,4.094736842105263
4794772,3,B005LAIHY0,"This movie is an entertaining popcorn flick. The cinematography & primary characers' acting is nicely done. However, the 2nd characters' acting is mostly terrible, the plotholes will make you confused, and the terrible science will make you cringe if you're science-minded. And when I say terrible science, I mean the science makes absolutely no sense, and this movie barely qualifies as ""science"" fiction. Ridlely Scott made an attempt to rival the engrossing and legendary Alien trilogy. It falls short, but it's still a decent movie none the less.

Here is a list of all the good and bad of the movie.

1. Cinematography:

Great scenes. The scenery is nicely done, fits the tone and makes the world seem epic. In line with the dark scifi tone of the earlier films, although a bit more flashy (more Avatarish) and less gritty.

2. Acting:

Theron and Fasselbender are great. Rapace is decent. The ship captain is ok. The others are mediocre. The guys who play the scientists
and Rapace's husband are terrible.

3. List of Plot holes & Crappy Science:

1. Why did the alien have to sacrifice himself in the beginning? He could've cut himself or taken a dump in the water...both would've deposited DNA that would've given rise to live. Or taken a dump in a bucket, drip in some blood, and then stir in some black goo...BAM Primordial Ooze!
2. It's impossible that the aliens created life on earth to create humans. Mankind evolved through the slimmest of chances. ie., humans wouldn't be around if the dinosaurs weren't wiped out by meteorites...or if the dominant invertebrates weren't killed off in mass extinctions. Did the Engineers pull the strings on every major cataclysm on the planet for billions of years?
3. The Engineers could not have created life because that would make their civilization billions of years old. This is impossible based on their technology (or lack there of). Their technology and biological features also seemed unchanged between the two time periods of the movie.
4. How did the two explorers get lost when they had a 3-D map of the entire area, plenty of explorer/scouting robots, and direct radio communication with the ship that also a hologram map of the place they were in?
5. Why did they create humans, get us to worship them, and then try to wipe us out?
6. Why did they create extremely dangerous biological weapons (that is a huge threat to them as well) in order to wipe out technologically primitive humans?
7. How did the android know that dipping black goo in the guy's drink was going to turn his sperm into alien-squid sperm?
8. Why did the Engineers create humans, get us to worship them, then give us star maps to one of their secret weapons base?
9. Again, WHY THE HELL DID THEY GIVE CAVEMEN HUMANS A MAP TO THEIR PLANET FULL OF SECRET BIO-WEAPONS???

4. More Plot Confusion and Uncharacteristic Behavior for the Characters:

1. Why did the scientists act like dumb jocks?
2. Why did the two women at the end run in a straight line to get away from a thin flat falling donut?
3. Why did the alien with his head chopped off run TOWARDS the room with the deadly biological weapons?
4. Why didn't the squid-facehugger give birth to a chest burster?
5. How did the squidhugger grow big without consuming mass (I know, this is in line with the regular alien series)...
6. Has the scientists never heard of ""dangerous microbes"" when they decided to take off their helmets?
7. Why did they let the robot mess around and press every button on the ship?
8. The main character played by Rapace gives birth to a squid alien, and she just shrugs it off and everyone else is fine about it?
9. The billionaire old guy who is suppose to be dead suddenly shows up near the end - and everyone conveniently ignores him/is fine about it.",1349827200,3,3771,4.675716440422323

Blu-Ray - 1 takes forever to load.  I'm talking 4-5 minutes of black screen after the Blu-ray may take a while warning.  Loaded Avengers = 10 seconds.

Supposed to connect with Alien - So explain why the ""Engineer"" doesn't die in the pilot's seat as shown in the first 15 minutes of Alien.  The ""mama"" Alien barely looks like Aliens.  I'm not one to be nit-picky but seriously I don't think the screenwriter and/or effects designers have watched Alien.

The robot - Seriously, ""Data"" from Star Trek without the silver makeup but with pink lipstick instead.

Rich Guy - makeup, think Old Biff from Back to the Future.  I think they just reused the mask.

I think other reviews have hit on other points.

Ships Captain - (probably the best supporting character) a black man who carries a squeeze-box from Crosby, Stills, Nash and sings their songs. Ugh!

Charleze Theron - Rich Girl In-Charge - has a medical bay that is only for males.  ""I didn't come 2 years away from Earth to get laid... Come to my room in 10 minutes to get laid."" Nuff-said!

A spaceship that is 2+ years away from Earth with a ""lifeboat"" that doesn't fly.  Guess what ... the Alien is on the lifeboat.  So maybe they watched enough of Alien/Aliens to go for a recurring theme.

The mapping team that leaves first but is the only pair to get lost. I swear I thought that guy was Jason Sidekis? from SNL.

A genetic poison that is used by the robot to make Alien sperm that impregnates an infertile female to have a c-section that turns into a giant Alien egg layer, that lays an egg circa Alien in an Engineer, that turns into Mama Alien.  Really.

Incept-alien.  An alien in an alien laying an alien to spread aliens.

4794816,4,B005LAIHY0,"I just watched this movie and I can say that for once I think most user reviews got it right. While the movie was visually appealing (it looked pretty amazing in point of fact) the story seemed rushed. Almost as if it could have benefited from an extra 30 minutes of scenes added in (I can only assume the typical Hollywood Dougs didn't think people would wanna watch a 3 plus hour long movie) to stretch out the story better and make things seem less like happenstance. I thought the premise and concept were great, I thought the effects and design were great, I just think the execution was not great. It seemed like something was missing, and even though I found the movie enjoyable and a good modern horror sci-fi film much in the vein of Alien, I think this movie could have used an extended cut to draw out sequences and segue one scene to the next more smoothly as I felt some of the transitions were choppy. I could even see this being better as a 6 episode miniseries as the concept was to big for the length of the film. On Blu-Ray, Twentieth Century Fox puts out another immaculate transfer of a movie, it pops onscreen and is one of the best and most detailed releases I've seen to date. And with a 3 and a half hour making of, the special features are great. Well worth the $25 bucks. Aside from the pacing problems, I wish the design was a bit more plain and a bit more 1970's like Alien. Although I really like the design in this movie, in Alien the computer screens were green and simple (because that's what computers looked like in 1979 and movie magic couldn't really enhance that like it can today since the advent of CGI) and costumes weren't as sleek as this movie which makes some distance between them, continuity wise.

4794817,3,B005LAIHY0,"I will say I can see all the conflicting reviews on the action and what it started as and what it finished as. Bottom line for me it peaks my intrest in the next installment and did not put me to sleep. Just knowing that we will eventually endup at the original Aliens is good enough for me.

 I am an middle school 3D fan 70's early 80's [when 3D would pop off the theatre screen ""the operating table in Warhols Frankenstein hovered over the first 5 rows of audience I was seated 3/4 of the way back in the theatre.

-There have been various opinions about the special effects.  Personally, I thought the visuals and soundtrack were awesome.  They definitely made me favorably disposed towards this film.
-Michael Fassbender is spellbinding.

The Bad:
The main problem with the entire film is that nobody (other than Michael Fassbender) has any plausible motivation for the majority of their behavior.  As a result the entire movie is basically just an exercise in convenience, much like your modern B-movie horror flick.

**** COMPLETE SPOILER ****

Weyland is old and dying.  A couple scientists convince him our progenitors are located in a specific solar system based on some old cave paintings found in separate locations.  Weyland immediately spends a few trillion on a space ship and fills it full of the most absurd band of miscreants he can find, plus one awesome android, plus himself (shhhh it's an unnecessary secret).  His plan?... become immortal somehow.

It's just completely absurd.  Why is he secretly on the ship, instead of just... entirely visibly on the ship?  It's HIS ship.  Why does he think wandering up to these aliens and asking them a few questions is a good route to immortality in the first place?  Honestly his role/quest is entirely unnecessary and should have either been legitimized with SOME sort of evidence, reasoning, or belief structure, or thrown out.  When his quest inevitably and laughably fails even his final quote... is stupid.  We don't care enough about his mission to care about its failure.

The four scientists are far more maddening and will be discussed from least maddening to ""makes me want to curl up into a ball and sob uncontrollably"" can-of-walnuts crazytown.  We start with the two scientists who discover the... constellation (hold on a minute, why were the aliens pointing out their biological-weapon-factory-planet to a bunch of neandarthals?? A 20,000 year delayed trap?  SENSELESS).  Noomi has ""faith"" which is discussed and never legitimized outside of some sad, pithy dreams, but she has very little sense.  She does, however, occasionally react to situations properly.  This occasional legitimate action makes her not completely terrible.

Noomi's boyfriend scientist does not react to any situation properly.  First, he takes of his helmet because... Why not?  He gets depressed by finding dead aliens instead of living ones.  He also manages to be a gigantic asshat to the most dangerous character on the ship (Michael Fassbender drips with menace throughout the entire movie).  Afterwards he sees proof that he is infected with some crazy alien eye worms and... ignores it.  Ingenious!  Needless to say when he is torched with a flamethrower nobody cares.

Choosing who is worst between the geologist and biologist is kind of like choosing the least appetizing between two liver flukes.  You can't win.  The geologist gets lost in a cave which he MAPPED with his OWN devices.  Furthermore being that he is... I don't know... a GEOLOGIST, why can't he find his way out of a cave?  Meanwhile the biologist, in possibly the most daringly risky action in all of fictional biology, sticks his hand basically INSIDE the mouth of an alien death snake after RUNNING from a ""possible life form reading"" in the previous scene.  What lifeform was he imagining previously if he's willing to immediately leap into the mouth of a terrifying, albino snake-beast?  They both die horribly and nobody cares.  I honestly laughed derisively.

This is all a long winded way of saying a bunch of stuff happens and nobody cares, seemingly not even the characters in the movie.  The science doesn't make any sense, of course, but I cared a lot less about that than the terrifying senselessness of the story and characters.  Once the movie clunkily transitions into its horror phase there is a feeling of stupid inevitability to every death as the characters one by one run (sometimes quite literally) directly towards their doom.  At the end of the movie (kindly telegraphed by the previews to the movie... thanks marketing!) all I could feel was a general malaise.  This feeling combined with the knowledge that this script could have been fixed for about .01% of the money pumped into special effects left me decidely nonplussed.  This movie could have been one of the best Sci Fi epics of all time; instead it's a laughable farce.

I will say on it's own merits, the movie is good but not great. There are many theories about what RS was REALLY trying to say about who the Engineers were. I won't get into that because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.

I think if you're a fan of religious studies or mythology, you will be able to see certain patterns and read in between the lines, at least enough to realize certain themes, and that no info, plot point, date, or number given is a mere coincidence but rather a reference to someone else to help give subtext to the story.

While I enjoy the movie quite a bit, more so the second viewing, I was left wondering if RS edited himself and the story he intended to tell to have the answers be in future movies, or because he was afraid of the backlash from religious fanatics if he outright said what he wanted to say.

On a different note, the movie is visually fantastic and stunning. The sense of scale is literally awesome, and it does a great job of showing us how puny us as humans really are.",1349827200,4,1217,4.950980392156863
4794896,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm reviewing the discs themselves - not the movie, though I do agree with the many 1 star reviews. I bought the Bluray 3d, etc., 4 disc product, but because of what I suppose is 20th C.

I have been playing Bluray movies on a PC for years, and have had several Bluray 3d movies in the last year that played just fine. If some companies are going to pursue such draconian measures then they should put that info in a prominently readable place on the packaging. There was no such notice on this title that I could find.
Update: I did get the 3d, etc. to play on my system finally. It required updates and config. to Power DVD and my SLI video set up. Sorry about the confusion. I also think this is a better movie than I had originally said it was. All SciFi movies have implossible scenes written into them. So, not so bad after all.",1349827200,8,1023,4.1457286432160805

This is a fun movie that provokes the mind to see outside the box and just enjoy a good old sci-fi. If you like any of the alien movies you will like this and enjoy the ending scenes. It is an updated homage to the old films and a good watch.",1349827200,8,595,4.0423728813559325
4794898,1,B005LAIHY0,"I was really excited about this movie until I saw the reviews for it and waited until now to finally rent it.  I cannot say I am even glad I only rented it because Prometheus is one of the worst movies I have ever seen so it wasn't worth the $5 or the 2 hours to watch it.  Without its big budget and Scott's name attached, it probably would have been rejected by even the SyFy channel for a 3am time slot on Tuesday morning.

As many have already stated, there are problems everywhere and it is hard to believe Ridley would produce such a horrible project.  His first mistake was obviously hiring Damon Lindedof of Lost to rewrite/edit the script.  Lost was a mess of a story and Prometheus is no different.  It has the characteristic underdeveloped and incoherent script/story that will soon be known in Hollywood as a Lindedof.  The characters are horrible cookie cutter stereotypes (the dumb biologist with the coke bottle glasses, the annoying cocky guy that yells WOOOO!!! every scene he is in, the machine that tries to be human, the mean group leader, etc.) and, has been pointed out, there are so many plot holes and nonsensical points it is impossible to care / take seriously anything that happens in this movie.  There are so many that its just impossible to even turn your brain off to overlook them.  And no, this wasn't a ""it's too deep for you to understand"", it was dumb/stupid/moronic.  If you want to see something complex and deep, read the Dune series.  You want to watch a movie so bad the MST3000 guys show up, watch Prometheus.

Then there is the travesty people are calling visuals.  Seriously, the people who gave this movie 5-stars need to get over your Michael Bay idea of anything GCI is art.  Nearly completely gone are the beautiful works of biomechanical art produced by HR Giger that in my opinion MADE the Alien franchise.  It was replaced by standard stock GCI used in almost all SciFi movies and TV shows.  And do I even need to mention the freshman year old-guy special effects?

Do yourself a BIG favor and pass on this.  Do not rent it and certainly don't waste your time when it is free on TBS in a few years.  It isn't worth it.  You are better off watching something on the SyFy channel.",1349827200,10,2229,4.497512437810945
4794899,5,B005LAIHY0,"I actually only got to see the last ten minutes of this movie in the theatre.  I was waiting for another movie to start and I took a peek.  I was mesmerized by how visually stunning it looked.  I never got a chance to go back to see it, so I figured I would just buy it in 3D when it came out.  Sometimes you know you're going to love a movie before you even see it.  After some of the negative reviews I was even more fascinated.  The meaning of life connected to the ""Alien"" movies?  Wow!  It upset people because everything wasn't clearly explained.  I have to get this movie.  After viewing it I was exhilarated from the experience.  3D at it's best!  There are quite a few movies with 3D with cheezy in your face gimmicks.  If they did that with this movie the cheap distraction would cause a huge suspension of belief.  I drifted right into the screen.  The depth was enthralling!  It was like watching IMAX's ""Space Station"" and ""Hubble"" with a great suspenseful story.  I didn't want it to end.  I didn't expect it to be a shocker, like the other ""Alien"" movies.  It had that same intense prolonged suspense that ""Alien"" had.  I love ""Ancient Aliens"" and such subject matter.  So I was fascinated with the idea. What if at some point we actually found them?  What would we learn?  Would they be kind?  Could they help us understand our purpose?  Who made them? And so on.  This alone being the foundation for one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Time will tell when people stop scratching their heads.  I wasn't expecting the meaning of life to be revealed.  What was revealed made sense within the realm of the story itself.  With video you can go back and you can subtitle things you have trouble hearing and I found certain things could easily be missed with a straight non-stop viewing.  I can't wait to see it again and watch the 3 1/2 hour documentary.  I did watch the deleted scenes and understand why they were cut.  Great job Ridley Scott.  I would like to see this the beginning of what should end with ""Aliens"".  I'm sorry, like so many, I just didn't like the post ""Aliens"" movies.  You can probably pop in ""Alien"" after this one and find a flow, but I know there is more.  The tech in ""Alien"" seems older.  More like Prometheus without the touchscreen. Let's just say that crew got a second rate vessel because it wasn't as highly financed as the first.  Maybe for some reason certain technology plateau's at some point. The similiarities of the crafts are very obvious.  I love this movie and highly recommend it.  I have a feeling it will age very well and become a classic.  ""Alien"" fans will see the saga come full cycle finally.  I never thought they were just monster movies.  This movie proves there is nothing cheezy about it.

4794901,4,B005LAIHY0,"""It's best to let sleeping dogs lie.  But we can't since we're human,"" is probably one of the themes of this film.  In a sense, Prometheus is similar to Contact as we as humans want to figure out the following:  ""What are we doing here?  And why are we even here?""  Or some questions that I believe that the Jody Foster character asked in that other film.

I have to admit, I'm not much into the genre for the most part.  But that's only because many directors and writers tend to dehumanize the actors in science fiction for some reason; I think that most of the people in Sci-fi are just too mechanical and therefore not believable.  They didn't make that mistake in ""Contact"" for sure, a movie that I actually liked better because of the human element.  But the director here did a pretty good job, particularly by the third act, to give us some sympathetic characters, so kudos there.

I think that this film did get some of the science correct.  There were issues though, of course.  Without giving much away, one of the main characters has emergency surgery (won't say why) but she is still able to ""bounce around"" pretty well immediately afterwards.  I didn't buy that.  Also, one of the doctors at one point during a diagnosis is using a tablet computer, and in my opinion, by the time that this film is set (I think almost 100 years in the future) you would expect most human-computer interaction to be voice-activated.  Also, one major issue:  there is an assumption that is made that I didn't buy at all, the assumption that, if you have someone become a linguist expert on earth that that being would be able to understand another language on another planet with ease.  Not.  Natural language appears to be inate to higher-order creatures on earth, but the structure of natural language on another planet may be totally different.  (A similar but worse error was made by Jeff Goldblum in some other unwatchable film, where he uploads a virus into an alien computer system.  Really?  I laughed out loud during that scene.)

But overall, I'm giving this movie a recommendation for a view, even if you aren't really a sci-fi fan.  And that is surprising to me.",1349827200,5,2169,4.605744125326371
4794902,3,B005LAIHY0,"I have always been a big Alien and Aliens fan, the other sequels fall well short for me.  As for prometheus as you have read from other reviews it is not a prequel but probably the first in the series with probably one or two more before Alien came to be.  Been very mixed reviews, and all understandable.  It certainly has its holes in the plot which I wish as well was more thought out.

I find it very interesting that these beings are considered to be our makers, and that it was their DNA that changed our existence.  I wonder if we will ever find out the answer to why they did what they did. Will we find out what was said to David and what did he say to them ? It did make it more clear to me by seeing it again that this was an experiment from an incredibly advanced species that went terribly wrong.

Still the story is interesting (even with its holes)it is beautifully shot and visually stunning, which no one has denied.  The quality of the transfer to blu ray is pretty good, not perfect, wish was a little sharper detail.

I was so looking forward to this film before it came out, am a huge Ridley Scott fan and think he is an incredible director, certainly among the best.

It is certainly entertaining, no one can deny that and everyone into sci-fi should see it.  For me the extraterrestrial beings are truly fascinating in this film and can't wait to find out more about them.

4794993,4,B005LAIHY0,"This review is based on the Amazon Instant Video HD version (I mention this because you don't get the extra material at the end in the Standard Def. version) I can't believe all the people that said they are big fans of the Alien movies that said this movie has nothing to do with that series. The Aliens in this movie are the same aliens that were found in the first movie. I'm referring to the dead alien found in the pilots chair inside the alien space ship. They don't look the same because the alien in the first movie was wearing a space suit. The same space suit that is seen at the first encounter with the aliens in this movie. To make this more clear, in this movie  there are 2 alien life forms in the movie. A human like alien and a monster like octopus alien that starts out like a worm. This movie takes place before the first Alien movie. Another misconception is the one where the humans had touched the alien goo, and how dumb that was. Watch the movie again but more closely this time. It's the android that does all the touching of the alien substances . I didn't see this movie in the theater because of all the criticisms. And I have to admit that the previews made the movie look dumb. But after I saw it I thought it was mostly misunderstood. But I had the advantage of reading the reviews and I was looking for what was said regarding the dumb things that were reported. As my title says, after the credits there are scenes that were cut out and should not have been that show a more recognizable alien bursting through the chest of the human like alien. As stated in the first Alien movie, these creatures take on DNA from their host that changes their appearance. So what you see in this movie as far as the octopus like creature becomes the aliens that were in all the other movies. I've got enough spoilers in my review and I'm sorry for that but I thought there was to much confusion (and intentional misdirection from Dir. Scott) to just review the movie. There have been a number of poorly made Alien Vs Predator movies recently and that's probably why Mr Scott said that this wasn't another Alien movie like the previous ones.
 So do I recommend this movie? Well if you know the difference between interesting SIFI and Horror SIFI, then I would say it's good interesting SIFI. But if your looking for a movie more like Aliens where the monster aliens eat everybody, or turn them into incubator's hanging from slim covered walls, and lots of machine gun action and space marines then your out of luck. Mr Scott has made a movie that's more like there were no other sequels to Alien until this one. I would suggest anyone that wants to make more sents of this movie watch the first one again, then this one and rather then paying close attention to the action, and all the other visual attractions, listen to and remember what's being said. you'll find there some interesting connections.",1349827200,,2918,4.432029795158287

Later, LG sold me 3D TVs and Blu-Ray 3D players that were not ready for the marketplace. LG stinks. It took them over a year to issue a firmware fix/patch for 3 out of 6 products I bought from Amazon.

The 3D is very excellent.

The lack of 3D takes away from the movie. If these damn studios claim it is 3D then they are liars. There is no in your face 3D in this movie even at the most critical 3D times in the script. And 3D has been around for a century. It was around at the San Francisco World's Fair in 1915. The San Francisco World's Fair's 3D is stunning. Check it out on the WWW.Editing, 3D was around in 1830s in stereoscopic viewers, something like Viewmaster. Euclid himself knew about stereo vision. How ancient is that?

I remember the 3 Stooges 3D movie or movies when I was a little kid. The 3D was vastly superior in the day of the 3 Stooges. WYSIWYG. If the cardboard glasses deliver great 3D and Blu-Ray 3D ain't great, which is better?

The actors in all these movies are carrying on to keep themselves out of print in the movies themselves. Prometheus is no exception. Perhaps, these morons think they are making a threat with their words,scenes and stupid gestures. I guess they call it a one two career saving punch. Show business would start a war for their next role, their next production. How American can that be?

Give me 3D or shove it. Have to pay a premium for 3D that doesn't really exist. The openings have graphically 3D titles. Then the 3D is reduced to about nothing. My LG 3D TV set works. My LG 3D DVD Blu-Ray player has the latest patch. My glasses are the recommended. Got em all at Amazon.

There should be laws protecting the consumer over 3D fraud.

Show business stinks and are partly responsible for the WorldTradeCenter. 9/11? 9/11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number. Show business and the press have never said a word about that or anything about their entertainment or the telephone companies comments. The government is pathetic and sickening.

Would buy Prometheus as a regular DVD release if I were you. Where is the beef? Where is the 3D.

Want 3D where I to have duck, bob, dodge and weave objects coming at me. I want the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in my face. Want to use my arms and hands to defend myself against the 3D onslaught on the screen. Traditional movies have the same vanishing point and perspective basically as most 3D movies. In the critical 3D scenes in Prometheus there was no 3D. The opening with Noomi mulling and puking into a bowl there was no vomit spill over unto the viewer. There was no sand/silica storm blowing in your face. Noomi's operation in the medical pod had no 3D where it was most crucial. The worms/snakes attacking the crew in the alien craft had no 3D whatsoever where it was very important. And on and on...

My comments are honest. I am not trying to sound like a snob with excessively florid language. Am not in the employ of the studios. Want Prometheus? Buy the regular DVD and save the difference. Damn good movie. It is a terrific movie.

Avatar is coming out next week. Have seen a few clips from a B&W version that had tremendously excellent 3D. Will the new release deliver the same? Hope so.

4794997,2,B005LAIHY0,"As a Sci-Fi fan forever, I can say that you won't be completely dissapointed by the film. The effects and visuals alone justify the ticket purchase, or in this case, the Amazon rental. However, the plot, writing and repeated gaps were painful. Indeed, they were so disparately jarring at times that the ability to suspend reality and enjoy the ride was impacted. I found myself constantly seeing the flaws as I watched the movie. It was worse than the horror flick where the main characters say ""let's split up and search"" - although in that genre you often forgive that particular cliche. In good science fiction, one needs internal consistency and solid writing - and even with a willing fan who will overlook many negatives - Prometheus fell far short of the bare minimum. I would still see it for the frame of reference, but don't expect a lot.

Spoiler Alert - stop here if that's a concern for you. These are small examples apart from the overall story issues:

If you have absurd technology that can 3-d map a hive-like stone structure on the surface of an alien planet in real time, how do characters get lost finding their way back outside? If those same charactes are a biologist and a geologist, would they really just leave the main group (for lack of interest) when the others have discovered alien technology/artifacts/bodies? If that same technology can detect life forms and give you active feeds on people's video/life signs, how do you not know what happened to them? If you are wearing clear helmets as part of an enclosed space suit, wouldn't there be a system to prevent them from fogging up? If you encounter a new life form that looks a lot like an aggravated cobra sizing you up for a meal... do you pet it like a puppy dog? Do you enter that same area without a single weapon or any security personnnel, especially when the lead corporate characters like to avoid risk? Do you use a ship that has not one offensive capability when traveling a bazillion miles from Earth so that ramming speed is your only option? If there is widespread contagion in a crew member (quizzotically put there by a corporate-created artificial human that we have no rules for, nor apparently do the characters expect any either) and that infected crew member has sex with another crew member - wouldn't the contagion spread throughout the second? If you are cut open to the core to remove a foreign object and stapled shut... should you be running a marathon the same day for example - even allowing for drugs, which the viewer has to assume will dull tremendous pain but have no effect on your mental state or physical performance? When said foreign object is removed and advanced medical tech machines are instructed to kill it... how many ways could that have been done so that the object actually dies without coming back?

The list goes on and on... and while I can take unknowns in my Sci-Fi movies, and I often relish hard to understand plots that leave the viewer thinking... that's not what happened here.",1349827200,17,3017,4.677966101694915
4794998,3,B005LAIHY0,"It is really difficult to judge this movie.

First of all the special effects are great. However, the story is way too complicated and hard to believe. The alien DNA breaking and then going through recombination with some kind of small earth amoeba living in the ocean is typical of someone who made a movie without any advice or consultation from a biologist. Or if Ridley Scott had a biologist on the set, the guy is purely and totally incompetent.

Few words on the plot: Scientists discover in a cave in 2089 drawings from 5000 years ago attesting to the fact that aliens came to colonize the planet. Fast forward 2093 when an eccentric billionaire has paid for a mission to go to a planet where we think the Alien creatures came. Michael Fassbender plays David a robot who apparently knows a lot about the mission, however nobody on the ship appears to realize it. We also find out that he knows how to drive the alien ship and he knows how to speak their language. Maybe in the next two movies we will find what is exactly his role. The other important player in the movie is Noomi Rapace (Elisabeth) who is one of the doctors of the mission. There are 15 more people on the mission and outside the driver of the ship and Charlize Theron, a really cold and calculated person, we don't know exactly what everybody is doing on the ship and why they are there.

I strongly believe that David is homage to ""2001 Space Odyssey"" (...I am sorry Dave I think I cannot do that). His voice, and his demeanor reminds us of the robot driving the ship in ""2001 Space Odyssey"". Also the plots are similar. I also believe that Elisabeth reminds us of Lizbeth, the"" Girl with the Dragon tattoo"". I am not sure why Scott kept the names, but throughout the entire movie, and since I was not sitting on the edge of my seat, I was constanly reminded of ""2001 Space Odysee"" and of the ""Girl with the dragon tattoo"".

Charlize Theron's role is totally secondary, and while her acting is absolutely fantastic as always, I think she should be more involved.

Three stars for the fantastic performance of the actors, and for the special effects, but the movie plot is really a work in progress. Hopefully the second and third movies will be better. Cannot wait to see the sequels!!!",1349827200,,2263,4.4963503649635035
4794999,4,B005LAIHY0,"All I have is one single, simple DVD of Prometheus, so that is all I can review or would even try to. Naturally I am interested in the production, the direction and the acting, and of course I was hoping for great things in the department of camera-work and special effects. However what I am rating this film on is one thing more than all the rest put together - the story.

That is not quite the same thing as the `plot', which I can tell you would not get four stars from me. I mean, these intrepid boldly-goers take the most irresponsible risks you could imagine. One of them is an android, sure, and he probably is the worst offender, but that is only because he is operating in obedience to His Master's Voice, and the master is another human being. Not only that, he is a business tycoon who seems to have been totally unsupervised by anyone supposedly given responsibility for protecting the rest of us. Business deregulation is all very well within rational limits, I dare say, but even now in 2012 we are all too aware of what some financial interests did to us and what they nearly did when we took our eye off them. That was only money, I suppose, but what this well-spoken old English geezer is playing with is the very survival of humanity to satisfy his own moribund curiosity, which seems to bother nobody. I shall not complain about the general scenario of interstellar travel being a fait accompli within this century, within my grandchildren's lifetime on a reasonable actuarial basis, because without that I would not have my treasured story at all. However I must protest about the collision between the spacecraft. In the context of the threatened apocalypse, and considering the power that these interstellar ships must have packed, this climactic scene is downright tame. Think of the wreck of the Hindenburg.

Still, the story gave me most of what I was looking for. The original Alien was found aboard an abandoned spaceship of unknown provenance or destination. That film was followed with three sequels, each in my opinion weaker than the one before. All the time I craved information regarding that sinister craft, and I have got it at last. Whether the craft's mission was one I might have expected I'm not sure because I had no clear ideas about that, but what we have here is a good old sci-fi yarn, of the kind I am old enough to enjoy because I have read so many of them. It tells us the origin of our race, which is rather an unexciting origin, humanity on earth being no more than a modified version of some other pre-existing beings, hailing from somewhere else but exactly like us only bigger.

Right at the end guess which old friend puts in a cameo appearance: I shall mask its identity subtly behind the abbreviation A...n. What goes along with this is the clear promise of further sequels, and these I shall make a point of surviving long enough to watch, because the heroine and the robot commandeer a spare spaceship to head off into the realm where our deep-space ancestors really originated. Her interest in this is curiosity again, I suppose, but this time of a more reputable kind, given what she has been through, than the old moneybags had.

The acting is not exactly Oscars stuff, and the script is a bit wooden in places, especially near the start, but it is not bad in general. The special effects department do very well, as you would expect. As in Alien, there are some fine creepy sequences that may take you two viewings to appreciate in the dim light - what-are-they-seeing-that-I'm-not-seeing kind of stuff. However two viewings and I think I have got the whole plot, or most of it. I might even watch it again sometime, but what I really want is the sequel.",1349827200,3,3717,4.601809954751131

It is coarse with regards to the characters and relies on non Alien franchise ideas (black goo/ purity from x-files) inexplicable behavior by the engineers, stupid behavior from the crew etc. etc. Perhaps the behavior could best be explained an ancient Weyland-Yutani temporal accident gone full circle or maybe the engineer race are actually Genetic Rights Activists freeing all genetic material in the universe from the burden of supporting life.

4795083,2,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus, the space ship filled with scientists, intrigue and deception, sets out to find the creators of the human race.  Somehow, from five or six random circles on old cave murals, humans find the path to a place light years distant (which is a heckuva lot farther than the ""half billion miles"" the woman in charge, Vickers, claims).  Beware of plot giveaways in the following, although I don't think any of them is significant.

It's hard to imagine a more unbelievably dopey crew than this one.  When they discover that the founder race's folks are dead, the male scientist goes on an extended drinking binge.  What a dumb slob.  He wanted to talk to the creators, and when he couldn't he took non-stop to the bottle.  Which also indirectly led to his downfall.  If he'd thought for about 2.7 seconds he'd realize that the master race is quite likely still alive, even if its crew on this planet is dead.  Then there's the Laurel and Hardy duo which turns chicken and heads back early to the Prometheus, only to get lost.  Even though they can give their position's coordinates inside the ancient structure and are being tracked on a 3-D hologram in the Prometheus, they're still turned around.  In order to make the plot work, one of these morons plays with the critter swimming around in the mysterious black goo running between the mysterious canisters.  By this time you're pretty much rooting for the monsters to win.

It turns out at the end that there are many alien ships on that forsaken planet.  Why?  What happened to their crews?  Given what happened to the Prometheus's crew, does it make sense to confront the creators' home planet, other than as a suicide run?

What made Aliens work was a believable plot filled with believable people acting in believable ways in a horrific situation.  That's entirely missing here.  Mysteries are left unsolved here, which is all right.

I have always been a huge fan of sci-fi, horror, etc.  Prometheus was really painful to watch.  Almost void of terror, and really constantly unbelievable and at times just stupid and silly.  Alien on the other hand was constantly feeding pure terror, and always realistic to the point of believable.  Prometheus is unworthy of it's association with Alien.  Quite frankly I am really disappointed with the terrible garbage hollywood churns out.  Good movies are just so ridiculously rare these days.  Yeah go ahead and rent this movie.

4795088,3,B005LAIHY0,"The movie has been reviewed to death. Nothing much I can add there - except that some parts will really make you squirm!  The quality is flawless, the effects mind-blowing, the ancestral/nascent versions of the Face Huggers and Aliens is friggin great.

So I'll review the product.  Movie: 5 stars. Digital extras, etc. - 0 stars. The digital download options are horrible. You can pick the new ""Untraviolet"" option - this requires that you join one of two streaming video services. It's 10 minutes of jumping through hoops, answering questions, entering the same code multiple times and verifying email accounts. You can't simply copy and play.

The other option is using iTunes to copy the movie. What if I don't have iTunes or don't want to use iTunes?  So I went to my old computer that did have iTunes. It won't accept the code. It gives an error that the movie must be redeemed using the DVD. The DVD runs a program that simply opens iTunes and instructs you to manually enter the code. The end result - no digital copy on iTunes. After six tries it finally worked. The program was not loading iTunes correctly. Want to watch it on your Droid tablet? Forget it - unless you want to stream the Ultraviolet version. I don't want to waste my battery powering WiFi when I don't need it.  But I can't copy the digital version to my tablet. So much for watching it ""anytime, anywhere.""

While that's going on, I decided to scan the QR code on the insert ""to learn more.""  Too bad it can't be scanned. Droid X phone, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet, iPhone4 and iPad2 - none of these could scan the QR code. I guess the designers never bothered to test it.

So I figured I'd try the app. What an irritating, frustrating little program this is. It just screams ""DELETE ME!"" Slow, clunky, half the options just give an error that it has to be synced to the movie to work - and even then they don't.

This disc was obviously designed to push Blu-Ray to it's limits. Interactivity, menus - you name it. The problem is that they pushed it too far, to the point that unless you have a top-end player, the entire system fails miserably. For example - In the main menu, I could not navigate to any option except ""Play"" unless I powered down the player, powered up again, and immediately selected a different menu option, such as ""Extras"". If I played the movie first, then went back, it locked.  As for the ""Easter eggs"" - forget it. Could not get one to work. Locked up or did nothing.

The deleted scenes - not too many. A couple were interesting, and you could tell that they could have played the characters a couple of different ways.  ""Alternate ending"" - could not get it to work, and that's assuming I even found the correct menu option. Again, the power-cycling between options was frustrating.

So if you want a great movie on a fantastic format - and don't care about the digital copies or app, then you'll be thrilled.  Expect anything else to work? Forget it.

Final insult: I have three Blu-Ray players. All three have the most current firmware. The DVD will only play on one of them. Won't play in my Samsung or Sony, but it will play in my Sanyo. But it takes forever to load, and sounds like an old computer floppy disk on and off for a minute - The rattly sound when it loads data and the machine-gun staccato when it resets.

One final comment. They used the cheapest possible case for this product. It offers almost no protection, and is way too flexible. The DVD cases were great - this is not much better than paper. As for printed extras - just the insert with the redeemable code.",1349740800,8,3591,4.466360856269113
4795089,5,B005LAIHY0,"I enjoyed this movie immensely!  It is visually engaging and wonderfully suspenseful.

Some have criticized Ridley Scott's attempt to interject the existential (i.e. where does man come from and where do we go?), and that criticism is fair -- those parts of the film that broach the origins of man are done in the most unsubtle, least imaginative, manner possible (okay, except for the beginning which is very well-done -- but dialogue regarding this topic is . . . strained at best).  However, it is testimony to the quality of the film overall that I still give it five stars.

Prometheus is a fast-paced, well directed, and well acted -- I recommend it unreservedly!

And one final note -- to those who are hammering the movie because of the premise upon which it is built (i.e. life's origins) let us all remember that it is a science FICTION, not science.",1349740800,4,860,4.706666666666667

Sure there's some stuff that defies logic, they do jump into things hastily especially considering they landed on a new and hostile planet, but it puts you into a world like no other and leaves you wanting to see what's next. And it raises questions we're all interested in even outside the context of the film - about things like faith, our origins, and artificial intelligence. ""Why do you hate us!"" is a line that resonates strongly. And you have to watch David, the android, closely as there is a lot of subtle stuff going on with him and his interactions with the crew, especially a scene by the pool table with some lines that reminded me of another Ridley Scott film, Blade Runner. It's a good mix of Alien and Aliens, though maybe less claustrophobic, but really stands on its own and manages to make those old films feel dated as awesome as they still are to watch now and again.

4795092,4,B005LAIHY0,"I liked Prometheus, but I really enjoy sci-fi books and movies so I tend to have a good time even when the story or other elements are somewhat mediocre.

I have read some of the other reviews and there are many points I would agree with. In hindsight some of the decisions made by the characters in the movie really don't make much sense. A few of those decisions are extremely stupid. Yeah, petting the thing that looks like a pissed off snake is probably a bad idea. There are some pretty hilarious reviews out there pointing out all the dumb decisions that were made throughout the movie.

Where I disagree with some of the other reviews is regarding David and the crew. I saw David as a emotionless robot that was given a specific agenda by his ""creator"". Sometimes he seemed almost evil, but he was making decisions like a computer would and not based on actual emotional connections. As for the crew, the movie takes place more than 75 years in the future, but we are watching it and seeing it through the eyes of the world we live in today. The movie doesn't at all discuss the state of the planet, its technology, or space exploration, but quite a bit can be inferred from what we do see. Space travel is most likely very normal with jobs in space being common so who makes up the crew didn't really seem strange to me, especially considering it was a private company paying for the mission and not the government.

The cast did a good job, though I was disappointed to see Charlize Theron so under-utilized when she is capable of so much more. I enjoyed Noomi Rapace as the main character and Michael Fassbender did do a really good job playing a character that seemed both good and bad at different times which means he was a great robot for the movie.

As for the movies connection to the original Alien movies, Prometheus does do a good job of answering some things, but it also leaves you really scratching your head asking the question Why quite a few times. Why exactly were the aliens on that moon? Was it really just a place to create biological weapons? Why would the aliens create us and then want to destroy us? Why were they using the methods they did and not just super nukes or a disease that kills everyone? When the last living alien realized the crew was from Earth its reaction was to start killing everyone. Why? Are they just evil? Is there something about humanity that we don't know? I also want to know why that alien in the beginning of the movie killed himself and where the huge spaceship was going. The questions can go on and on, and it looks like a sequel is in the works that will officially bridge the gap between Prometheus and the original Alien movies. Its obvious that certain questions were answered, but there are a few big pieces of the puzzle still missing.",1349740800,,2806,4.453307392996109

Nobody at Amazon could tell me exactly what ""digital copy"" meant or who was serving that content.  Being smarter than the average bear and having a strong grasp of the google, I was disappointed that an answer was lacking.

So here's your answer: it's an UltraViolet digital download.  (for info about UltraViolet see the wikipedia article on ""UltraViolet (system)"")

Personally, I don't like the UV system, and I'm very disappointed that Amazon has a product description that is ambiguous to the point of being misleading.  (Amazon Instant is the only streaming service named near the words ""digital download"").  I see other titles explicitly name the UV system, but this one, frustratingly, does not.

So for those who want to know, there you go.  That's what you get for unnamed ""Digital Download"" included with Prometheus.

If you care about this, please let Amazon know.  If they do effect changes, I'll update this to reflect that.

UPDATE: A slip in the case also mentions a second ""Digital Copy"" available from ""degonline.org"" which is supposed to be compatible/transferable to iTunes.  The same ""Redemption Code"" is used for either.  It suggests either UV or degonline.org, but not both.",1349740800,5,1418,5.0257510729613735
4795172,1,B005LAIHY0,"I did not see this in the theater, but waited for it come out on Blu-Ray.  Stupid me, I pre-ordered from Amazon and just received, watched it. My title explains my feelings.  The only thing I hope comes out of this is that someone makes a movie, different writer and director, of where the Aliens came from and why they created humans.

There are number of things that make this unbelievable; e.g., David learns the language by studing early earth languages, but how can he read the Engineer's writing, as the Engineer's spaceship crashes and roll towards them, Vickers and Shaw run in the same direction as the roll instead of to the side and out of its' path.

After wathing the extended and deleted scenes with the commentary on it was apparent that all these deletions were done for time, even if they helped explain the movie better.  This was done to keep the time to about 2 hours which allows more showing at the theater - pure profit motive.  I think they did this because they knew that they had a real lousy movie and needed to make their money ASAP.

Reviewers that gave this a 4 or 5 star only proves the point that America is becoming the stupidest country in the world.  Most of these reviewers are most likely under 30, and would not recognize a good story if it bit them on the butt.

I don't see alot of mesmerizing performances in sci-fi movies simply because too much is usually going on story-wise to get deep into characters. That is true in this film unfortunately, i say that not because the characters weren't explored early on and introduced through story (they were) but since i didn't feel emotionally attached to them like in some of the more memorable films i've seen. It's very hard to create that sense of feeling for a character in a few hours as opposed to tv where when an actor dies it's enveloping after watching for an entire season(walking dead, sons of anarchy, etc.) Overall, i was entertained and would say that this movie is to this franchise (alien) what terminator salvation was to it's franchise, just another installment. I've rarely seen preqeuls or sequels that are better than the original and this lives up to that stereotyping. I have to admit my #1 reason for renting was i crave sci-fi films which are few and far between unless you like the cheesy network b-movie variety and #2 was I'm a fan of Charlize Theron.

4795175,2,B005LAIHY0,"This review is for the movie itself, not for the actual DVD/Blu-ray packaging of the product.

When I heard that this movie was being released, I was excited.  So excited, that I actually avoided all reviews/previews/etc. so that when I saw it, on opening night no less, I could see it with my own eyes and not through the filter of other's opinions.

Well, lets start with the good; this movie has great production values. The cinematography, the special effects, the acting, all good. I really liked Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and even Charlize Theron (whom I usually don't like) in this movie.  I also like Logan Marshall-Green as the boyfriend, as he struggles to make his parts in this script seem believable.

The problem is the script. This movie is flawed in basic character action and motivation. It looks really good, but it doesn't make sense.  It's kinda like a music video or a dream sequence. There's just no reason for the characters to act the way they do in the movie. All actions are done in a forced, very artificial way to advance a bone-headed plot. The geologist/mapping expert gets lost. Someone takes off their helmet just because there's oxygen in the atmosphere. A biologist is scared of a dead body, then tries to pet an obviously hostile space snake.

It's not just the human characters, either, there's no reason for the Engineers to do what they do in the movie. Still, the ""monster"" going around eating/impregnating/infecting people makes more sense than a woman not realizing she should get out of the way of a massive moving object about to squish her.

If you're looking for ""hard-science"" sci-fi, look elsewhere. Black goo as a evolution accelerant is really the least of the scientific problems with this movie. You've got corporate-owned light-speed vehicles in only a century? In real life, we can't even fund the space shuttle!

And then there are the subtle, overall themes of the movie. Yes, I've read the Dec. 31, ""space-jesus"" explanations of the movie; again, it's forced, and it still doesn't fit. And high-brow ideas don't make up for the deep flaws elsewhere.

Overall, there are just too many holes in this movie, and not just the kind left on purpose for a sequel, or even the parts cut out like the TED speech. This was a very expensive disappointment. This movie is worth renting for the acting and visual effects, perhaps worth buying on sale, but not worth buying or paying full price in the theaters.",1349740800,9,2461,4.796690307328605

4795178,3,B005LAIHY0,"I would like to say I loved seeing Prometheus. So much I saw it twice in theaters. However, the movie is no where near perfect. I came in the theater expecting a great scifi movie with scares around every corner. Nothing! There are a few scenes that might scare people easily, but it's predictable when a scary scene is going to happen. Many of the characters were just there to die. They served no purpose but to be extras for the crew and die when the storyline had nothing for them. Many of the subplots where empty and didn't go no where. The story of Peter, his biological daughter Meredith Vickers, and David who he saw as the son he always wanted went no where! This movie could have been so much if they had great characters and storyline. I loved the visuals and the technology they used in the film. David was my favorite character in the film. Peter as an elderly entrepreneur was awesome and Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw was awesome. Prometheus is a good movie to enjoy if you're a fan of scifi films. Not a perfect film.

4795284,4,B005LAIHY0,"I liked Prometheus, but I really enjoy sci-fi books and movies so I tend to have a good time even when the story or other elements are somewhat mediocre.

I have read some of the other reviews and there are many points I would agree with. In hindsight some of the decisions made by the characters in the movie really don't make much sense. A few of those decisions are extremely stupid. Yeah, petting the thing that looks like a pissed off snake is probably a bad idea. There are some pretty hilarious reviews out there pointing out all the dumb decisions that were made throughout the movie.

Where I disagree with some of the other reviews is regarding David and the crew. I saw David as a emotionless robot that was given a specific agenda by his ""creator"". Sometimes he seemed almost evil, but he was making decisions like a computer would and not based on actual emotional connections. As for the crew, the movie takes place more than 75 years in the future, but we are watching it and seeing it through the eyes of the world we live in today. The movie doesn't at all discuss the state of the planet, its technology, or space exploration, but quite a bit can be inferred from  what we do see. Space travel is most likely very normal with jobs in space being common so who makes up the crew didn't really seem strange to me, especially considering it was a private company paying for the mission and not the government.

The cast did a good job, though I was disappointed to see Charlize Theron so under-utilized when she is capable of so much more. I enjoyed Noomi Rapace as the main character and Michael Fassbender did do a really good job playing a character that seemed both good and bad at different times which means he was a great robot for the movie.

As for the movies connection to the original Alien movies, Prometheus does do a good job of answering some things, but it also leaves you really scratching your head asking the question Why quite a few times. Why exactly were the aliens on that moon? Was it really just a place to create biological weapons? Why would the aliens create us and then want to destroy us? Why were they using the methods they did and not just super nukes or a disease that kills everyone? When the last living alien realized the crew was from Earth its reaction was to start killing everyone. Why? Are they just evil? Is there something about humanity that we don't know? I also want to know why that alien in the beginning of the movie killed himself and where the huge spaceship was going. The questions can go on and on, and it looks like a sequel is in the works that will officially bridge the gap between Prometheus and the original Alien movies. Its obvious that certain questions were answered, but there are a few big pieces of the puzzle still missing.",1349740800,6,2807,4.453307392996109

Ridley swings for the fences and comes close to the goal of a great film.  If I went by the sets, F/X, make up, futuristic look, I would give it 5 stars.  Some of the fault lies in the first Alien release which was immense, tremendous in scope, perfect, and created a new genre-  Sci Fi Horror; unleashed on an unsuspecting audience.  The impact of Prometheus isn't quite there, like the Sigorney Weaver vehicle.  It is a good film, not a great film.  The theme is layered: man's search for meaning in the universe, are we alone, can we cheat death, what will a superior species/advanced species tell us of their world, will we ever meet our creators?

4795290,3,B005LAIHY0,"Let's get this straight: PROMETHEUS is a polarizing film for many reasons.  I personally have yet to truly make up my mind about it.  Do I think it's an epically-drawn sci-fi piece, or an ego-driven effort into heady ideas and special effects?  I can't tell you.  Probably because, truthfully, it's both.

The plot begins simply enough: a pair of scientists discover ancient cave drawings that they feel point toward a distant planet.  This planet may or may not hold the secret to life on Earth.  The scientists gain funding, a crew, and a spaceship, and head toward said planet.  Bad things happen when they get there.  Very bad things.

There's a lot of good to be said in PROMETHEUS's favor.  The acting is solid; mainstays Charlize Theron, Noomie Rapace, Guy Pearce, and Logan Marshall-Green deliver solid, if not altogether memorable, performances.  Idris Elba is a standout in his supporting role.  Undoubtedly the best thing to be said about the film, everything else aside, is Michael Fassbender's performance as the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-loving android David.  Fassbender has Peter O'Toole down pat, quoting him left and right in a near-perfect imitation, while keeping his character ambiguous and vaguely threatening (think Lance Henriksen's Bishop, but British).  Fassbender possibly deserves an Oscar nom for this one...but then, he usually does.

Other good things: cinematography, special effects, overall ideology.  This film was a labor of love, and it truly shows.  There are some shocking scenes; there are some funny scenes; there are some touching and haunting scenes.  Bad thing: these scenes don't necessarily congeal.  Or maybe they do.  It depends if you buy into the overall goal of the movie, the point that it either makes or doesn't make (depending on how close attention you pay to details and plot holes).  The script is decidedly lackluster; it's bland and cliched, especially in dialogue.  Where the film excels is ideas.  The question is whether those ideas are carried out effectively.

MILD SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (though I give nothing away that I didn't know going into the film; if you are overly cautious, skip to the final paragraph).

Here's the thing: PROMETHEUS tries to do too much.  It's a sci-fi adventure film; it's a borderline-theology piece; it's needlessly a part of the ALIEN universe (as though director Ridley Scott forced his writers to add that in there); it's a commentary on the human desire to know everything, and the consequences that come with such knowledge.  It is all of these things separately; it is rarely all of these things together.  There are many great ideas buried at the core of PROMETHEUS; Scott and company mine deep enough to give us a glimpse of most of these, but rarely go far enough to fully dig them out of the ground.

Ultimately, whether you enjoy PROMETHEUS is based on your ability to suspend disbelief, open your mind, and marvel in what is otherwise a solid B-movie with A-list special effects and talent behind it.  If you can't do that, don't fret--PROMETHEUS doesn't work hard to make you to believe.  Instead, it bombards you with ideas.  It's supposedly the first of three films, so hopefully the second entry will settle all of the unanswered questions, and perhaps explain many of the plot holes.  (Though again: shouldn't this film answer all of its own questions?)",1349654400,6,3357,5.0
4795291,1,B005LAIHY0,"Everything is in this title. But they had to change it at the last moment for copyright infringements reasons.

The title ""Prometheus"" may actually be the only thing they didn't cut & paste from another previous story, if you except the Greek mythology that's been going on for a while now (like 4000 years or so). Seriously it felt like re-heated food from a couple of days (maybe weeks) ago. A constant sense of ""deja-vu"" spoiled every single moment of the film, with reoccurring ""subtle"" references to Alien(s), and other films of the same kind. I mean forced feeding references, like a good alien would do, you know what I mean...

Talking about food, I guess the only thing that they didn't dare to do in this grotesque farce, was to cook an alien just for fun ""to see how it tastes"". They actually came close to it by having a team member drink some alien goo without reason in a cocktail!! Jackass, here I am!! The team of dumb scientists is absolutely irresistible, I have to admit. But not in a multi-billion production like this. Maybe if the film would have been made by a group of sexually depraved high school students with their mobile phones, it would have been an interesting concept. Not here sorry...

I have to say that this film creates a category of its own, mixing top notch CGI, low grade trash, Z series sci-fi, tainted comedy, gory horror, and (cough) hyper cheap phi-lo-so-phy. The best of ALL WORLDS!! At the end of the day you get a CGI team who struggled to do its best (and I admit that they achieved well), with a seriously degenerate scenario, terrible acting and, OMG, the worst dialogs of all times, at least since the Earth was colonized by aliens. The dialogs made me wish the film was dubbed in the alien language. I almost suffered head hemorrhages at the vacuity of the phrases. But wait, maybe that's what happened to the alien's head by the way!!

Editing, as someone said, is nightmarish, and the argument which consists in saying ""just wait for the director's cut"", makes me puke my (alien) diner in advance. Two hours of this painful joke was way too long already. It's even laughable. In fact even the scientists, the aliens and the android laughed their heads off during the course of the film!!

I would have loved to hear what the Great George Carlin (not Lucas) would have had to say about such a ""gross misunderstanding"" of a movie. Personally, I feel sick...",1349654400,11,2409,4.593023255813954

4795404,4,B005LAIHY0,"The internet states there are some mistakes with lining up the two films (Alien and Prometheus), but it is my beleif that they are not supposed to line up.  This is not a true prequel as we know it.  While this part of the story is Pre-Alien, it is not directly ahead of that film in the timeline.  If these Alien films were chapters in a book, and Alien could be chapter 6, then Prometheus is like chapter 3.  For that reason, some of the origin questions are not answered in this film as this is not the beginning of the story.  It is not a lead-in to the Alien film either.  It only fills in a new part of the landscape. So, basically we are on a 'ride along' with a group of science-type people (Archeologist) looking for the meaning of life.  They proceed with the enthusiasm of a toddler into thier father's tool shed - looking for daddy.  Lots of sharp, complex and potentially leathal things in there.  You can guess how that turns out - but why it turns out that way is the warped part.  As many have already stated, it is a visually beautiful film and the 3D is amazing.  Probably the best use of 3D you've ever seen.  Avatar was good, this is better.

Don't expect to be spoon fed the answers like the typical film.  There is no narrator to tell you what's going on.  There is no epiphany where someone figures it all out and spews a meanful dialogue near the end of the film.  There's no summation in the credits.  You just have to watch the film and make up your own mind, but there are some burning questions from the Alien film that you will walk away with.  So, if like Sci-fi films that requires you to think, you'll probably dig this film and watch it repeatedly. If nothing else, there will be some intersting discussions prompted by this film.

The art direction was amazing and I might go as far as to say that it has the best art direction I've seen in a Sci-fi film since The Fifth Element. I loved what was present in the film and I even loved the viral ad campaign and all the little graphic touches that made Weyland Corp feel as real as Apple Computers.

The film established a great setting and visual tone but I get the sense that the script was a secondary priority. I can see that a lot of other people have gone into great detail about all of the moments where you had supposedly intelligent people do and say incredibly stupid things or arrive at decisions that made no sense. Not to beat a dead horse but I can't stress how greatly these instances effected the movie and diminished my enjoyment of it. It seemed any of these problems could've been avoided by hiring a fresh film school grad to sit in on the writing process and chime in with comments like ""why are they taking their helmets off?"" and ""why is the biologist spooked by the remains of a dead alien but eager to play with the face-raping snake monster?"" The dialog seemed like it had also been dumbed down I absolutely hate it when scientists in movies speak in gross over-simplifications or misuse their own terminology.

Scientist A: ""Why did this happen?
Scientist B: ""Because DNA""

When the biologist referred to the theory of evolution as ""Darwinism,"" I lost all hope of not being patronized. The only people who use the term ""darwinism"" in reference to the theory of evolution are creationists and they do this to equate evolution to a philosophical ""ism."" I do not suspect Damon Lindelof knew this and was merely attempting to sound sciency. Why dumb down a movie like this? Science fiction fans are quite often intelligent people. Why cater to a common denominator and make a mediocre film when you could've made a great film like 2001: A Space Odyssey? In fact, if you want to see great alternative that actually is everything that Prometheus tried to be, get 2001. Ridley Scott would agree. [...]",1349654400,6,2172,4.592783505154639

Alien was a new idea.  Aliens expanded the idea in a very credible and cool way, adding some nice layers of story.  Alien 3, 4, AVP, made the Alien world huge.

Non-Spoiler alert:

The plot is something like this: A bunch of college kids go to the haunted house because they are bored.  Almost right away the kids see that things are ""strange"" there but they proceed in a more careless fashion than they set out.  Naturally few of them die in spectacular fashion.  That fact has no impact on the survivors who continue to be even more careless. The local deputy, with his own agenda, sabotages few good ideas few of the kids have. Kids proceed to have more fun.  A storied monster creator shows up quickly followed by the out of control created monster. More kids die.  Monster kills its creator (franchise potential abounds).

That said, the movie is good and provides an interesting background and explanation for some of the things you see in Alien. The story is a bit weak towards the end and not some scenes do not make a lot of sense. However, the special features (Deleted scenes, alternate scenes - if your edition offers them) definitely add to the story. I think they should have been included in the movie and it would have made it much clearer. But maybe the decision was to keep the movie a bit shorter and more fast paced, I would have enjoyed a slower, more detailed movie more.

Then  there is the scene where the two scientists are lost inside the hollow mountain/space ship, and this reptilian creature rises up, stares at them, they remark on how cute it is, then it unfolds a fan like ornament/appendage around its neck and attacks--and this is taken right out of the film Jurassic Park. The list of thievery goes on and on in this film in search of a plot.

Then there is the really bad, often, really stupid acting. No plot, bad acting--its like a B-movie but with a 200 million dollar budget and almost no special effects worth mentioning. The movie is so stupid, the actors act like such idiots, the plot is so ridiculous... How could Ridley Scott produce such crap?

There is nothing original  or ""science fiction"" about this boring ridiculous movie which really didn't make any sense--which is probably because the film-makers were so busy stealing from other people, they didn't have time to develop a plot or come up with anything original. When they make part 2 of this film, one can only wonder who they are going to steal from next.

Final verdict. Boring, inane, stupid, a mishmash of other people's idea and work, coupled with some really bad acting and no plot.",1349568000,25,4051,5.4688
4795530,2,B005LAIHY0,"It was almost a good movie. Visually it looked great. Amazon did a great job with streaming it too! That was it. It was amazing that so many psychologically screwed up and incompatible people would be sent so far out into space. Hell, I wouldn't have known that the geologist was a geologist if he didn't actually state that he was one. Especially since he was doing space suit bong hits while exploring the ruins. And how the hell could they get lost on the way back to the ship. Oh yeah, he was high. go down the corridor and turn left and you should be at the lobby, if I'm not mistaken. Further more, you don't take your helmet off ever! It doesn't matter that there's oxygen there, you don't know if there is some sort of new micro organism that you can't detect. I've also never seen so many murder/suicide happy people before in my life. And the self-surgery/abortion scene, I don't think she would have been running around immediately after having an alien surgically removed from her, magic tech or not. Also, how the hell did the proto-face hugger grow so damn large without any sustenance. What, it consumes air and bandages? You can't just spontaneously create matter from nothing. Energy... sure. But I doubt it had a built in energy to matter converter. Oh, and let's not forget about the idea of the engineer being able to grant immortality. How the hell could any one assume that from scribbles on cave walls. Yeah, plot holes abound. I keep thinking that if they cut half the crap out they could have had an excellent film by just flushing out what remained. Oh, and before I forget, even if you haven't seen the film yet, if you've seen any of the trailers, you've already seen the ending. I'm so tired of crap like that.

The movie itself is really good. All the CGI is pretty awesome and the story really gets you involved.

I regret buying this movie thru amazon digitally. First half hour or so it was perfect then it started lagging and giving connection issues. I went to my PC and did a speed test and got 30mbps did it thru the PlayStation and got 25 too. So it was not on my side yet I had to keep restarting my connection so that amazon refreshed my IP.

4795723,2,B005LAIHY0,"**MILD SPOILERS...MAYBE?** So, the hand-picked cream of the crop of Earth's scientists and technicians, paid for by an anal-retentive, paranoid and very very rich man makes up the crew of arguably the only cool thing in the movie (the ship Prometheus).

Yet when these creme-de-la-creme people encounter basically what each of their career fields would call the motherlode of all time, they act like freshmen in an introductory (or possibly remedial) chemistry class.  The touch everything, they poke everything, they act surprised when things hurt or don't do what they expect, they test things that they *know* are probably dangerous and definitely ""alien"" in the sense that they have never, ever seen anything like it before, and they test it in an open room with gloves and gowns on...well, some of them.  They all deserved to pay the price for their obvious lack of, or abandonment of, their top-notch training.  These characters are so wholly unbelievable that after 20 minutes I couldn't care less if they all lived or died, and was hoping some would die painfully just to be reminded that ""touching substances you've never encountered before may be hazardous to your health"".  Oh and hey let's split up the first few hours we're here and leave behind a guy who has already been saying he doesn't like it here along with another scientist who doesn't use any basic high-school level safety methods.  That won't end badly at all, right?  And the head scientist, the one who wanted this trip like no one's business, doesn't bother to tell anyone when he knows there's maybe something wrong with him and maybe quarantine and a medical exam might be a good idea.  If these are the best money can buy on Earth, then Earth must be living in an Idiocracy.

Wow, what a joke.  Even the android's reasoning for it's callous and traitorous acts doesn't make sense.  No-one's actions make sense, except maybe once when Charlize tried to prevent someone from getting on the ship.  That's pretty much it.

Don't even get me started on the worst ""there's no escaping this one"" moment ever...even the guys at Penny Arcade figured out the answer!

Idris Elba must have been bored or needed money, because he phoned in his part here...granted he wasn't given much material to work with.  Theron was more mechanical than the mechanical man.  Fassbender performed well (one reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but again had poor material to work with.  The whole medical scene with Rapace was just ludicrous and may as well have been in a ""how not to perform surgery in any century"" how-to vid.  I guess Scott just wanted a gory visual to break up the terribly fragmented logic of the ""story"".

Instant and unexplained aggression from the engineer, with no rationale or justification beyond ""let's wrap this thing up and set up the ending"".

As usual Scott takes us on a visual 13-course feast, but the story just doesn't make the ride worth it.  The opening scene set up so much promise, which was then flushed away to a hack job of writing and continuity.

4795727,3,B005LAIHY0,"I love Sci-Fi and own a dvd copy of all the classics. I had such high hopes for this film. Sadly, it is mediocre at best. The trailer is much more exciting than the actual film. How did Ridley Scott manage to screw this one up? It could have been great but the film's dialogue and action scenes don't always make a great deal of sense. Leaving a question or two unresolved is good film making, but there are way too many questions left unanswered in Prometheus and far too many allusions to Scott's Sci Fi classic, Alien. This gives the viewer the impression that Scott's Sci Fi genious has run its course.

There is a minor but oh-so-aggrevating short-coming to this film. The rich old man in the plot who funds the voyage to this other world has no depth to his character, making him completely unbelievable. The shoddy make-up on this actor draws way too much attention to itself, which only detracts from an already one-dimension character. The are any number of sub plots that could have worked as an excuse to make a voyage across the vast universe. This one doesn't work, it's too cartoonish. As for the make-up, really? In this day and age, that is the best Scott could manage? At the very least, Scott should have employed an elderly actor rather than a younger one who is already in the cast.

To say that this film is boring is an understatement, in fact the previews are far more interesting and alluring than watching this garbage, and I would also state that watching paint dry would be about as fun while being less painful.

The fake Scottish accent, when seems to come and go, even transform into a British one briefly, then an American one briefly and back into fake Scottish...well thats what to expect I suppose when the main actress isn't Scottish, American, or British and the viewer is expected to not pay attention.

Much of this film is 'filler' where the director attempts to add rather than remove unnecessary segments, or as a professional director would to find the best segment and still minimize for transition---here is it the opposite ""lets have as much nonsense in between two points that the audience is (yawn) in suspense hopefully"".

It was like there were speed bumps through out this film that never allowed me to be fully engrossed and intrigued.

2) hey an alien snake on a desolated world with oddly breathable air.  I'm gonna pet it!

3) we just landed, it's about to get dark, buuuuuuut we have time for one quick expedition into those unknown alien ruins!

But The powerful theme of life, faith, and origins made up for it.  stunning visuals and the living engineers were really really cool. I realized that somehow, this movie had to move along and fit within a normal movie time frame.  If Scott didn't execute some people via terrible cliche horror movie decisions, then it would have taken a long time to get to the real point of the movie.  I will say that the snake scene was so completely awful that i really appreciated it on it's own merits.  sorry for any spoiler there, but you've never seen something go quite so wrong if you haven't seen that yet.

4795954,5,B005LAIHY0,Really this film gets a bad rap because people were wanting a full on precursor to Alien. It is much more than that and for that a better film. The imagery and methodology in Prometheus are some on the best put on screen.

There are enough pieces to answer some questions in Alien but open ideas to new questions for this science fiction thriller. Questions posed by the lead character have hints of answers but most are not revealed. As any good science fiction story would it asks you to think instead of leading you to obvious ends. The planned sequel may provide Ridley Scotts answers but we have a few years to guess where this adventure might end. Plenty of clues in Christian ethos are planted within the films dialog and on the screen at important parts in the film. Pay attention even to dates in question.",1349222400,6,997,4.606741573033708
4795956,1,B005LAIHY0,"I saw this film bubbling over with enthusiasm.  About halfway in, the disappointment had set in so deep that at that point, I was just waiting for the credits to roll so I could slink out of the theater.  This film is terrible.  I say this as a huge fan the genre, and of both Alien and Aliens.  It breaks one of the most important rules of story-telling: it doesn't make sense.  You have to start suspension of disbelief right out the gate as a nonsensical opening sequence starts the head-scratching race.  Let's break it down thusly (heavy spoilers):

1) The story starts with the a lot of quiet scenes of the android, alone, trying to entertain himself while he tends to the suspended animation tanks holding the Prometheus' crew.  If this assemblage of scenes seems familiar, that's because it is one of the first of several gratuitous references to the first movie.

2) We see actor Guy Pierce (Memento) making an appearance via pre-recorded hologram as a long dead scientist financier of the mission.  Despite the fact they point out the hologram was recorded prior to his death, throughout the scene he looks at the scientists seated before him.  I'll add that they bury Guy Pierce beneath what is really some of the absolutely worst old-man makeup I've ever seen.  It's so bad that it takes you out the movie for a moment.  I mean, it's like Saturday Night Live quality.  I've seen better makeup jobs on episodes of The X-Files.  I guess they busted the budget elsewhere.

3) This is a crew of what we are told are scientists/researchers/specialists who travel into deep space to visit an alien planet.  They illogically launch an expedition on the eve of a major storm, geared up in all sorts of protective gear.  They enter what they believe to be a series of caves and tunnels and react to this by promptly removing their protective breathing gear because, you know, the sensors say the atmosphere is breathable.  Now we know the atmosphere on an airplane is breathable too, including all the aerosolized flu virus the passenger behind you just sneezed into the air.  Apparently alien virus cooties do not concern this crew.  They soon encounter strange alien artifacts covered with black alien goop.  They react to this by promptly removing their protective gloves and begin to handle it with their bare hands.  (Palm slaps the forehead)

4) The android poisons one of the crew members with some of the alien goop he surreptitiously lifted from the caves.  No clear reason is given for this.  Allusion is that it is in furtherance of a plot-twist that most viewers will see coming ten miles away.  The poisoned scientist impregnates his girlfriend with an alien baby (because the goop he's poisoned with makes him impregnate women with alien spawn of course)--a move that is another one of several gratuitous references to the original films.  I'm sorry I gotta ask.  Was this impregnation by design?  And if so, how did the android know the two lovebirds were going to get busy?  Did he hear Barry White music wafting from their sleeping quarters?

5) Upon realizing she is impregnated with alien spawn the girlfriend ""takes care of it"" using a self-surgery machine introduced earlier in the film as being designed for male use only.  She over-rides quite easily which begs the question:  What was the point in mentioning that it was for male use only, after which that entire plot point is dispensed with in service of artificially induced dramatic tension?  If it being male-use only wasn't going to be an actual obstacle, why have it in there in the first place?  Why not just give her a conveniently located surgery machine in the off chance you have to pull an alien embryo out of your body?  At the conclusion of this scene old man Guy Pearce reappears except now (ta-da) he's not really dead, he's alive, a secret that had been hidden from the crew.  Why is this a secret?  At this point, you won't care.  More non-making sense will follow.

6) While exploring the caves the scientists get separated and one of them dies via an alien snake/squid/tentacle thingy.  The other ""scientists"" bring the decapitated head of a dead alien onboard the ship because, you know,as scientist they're of course all concerned about containment, hygiene, sterilization, etc.  So yeah, bring the dead alien head onboard.

7) Charlize Theron spends the entire film looking frigid and severe, then unexpectedly decides to have sex with the captain of the ship. This #1 happens off camera and #2 does nothing in service of the plot.

8) One of the scientist left back in the caves dramatically reappears just outside the spaceship except now he's an alien super-hulk monster.  So we got weird alien baby embryo, alien goop, porcelain-skinned giant space aliens, and super-hulk aliens.  Keeping count?

9) We finally realize that the alien caves the Prometheus has been painstakeningly tracking with little cool red tracker things--scenes we revisit about 50 times as the movies progresses--finally shows us the big reveal. It's not a cave, it's an alien spaceship!  I've never seen that plot device before, ""cough-cough"" Empire Strikes Back ""cough.""

10) Old man Guy Pearce, the android, and Noomi Rapace head back into what we now know is a alien spaceship.  The android revives one of the sleeping giant aliens.  The alien immediately starts killing everyone including ripping off the androids head, revealing copious amounts of plastic tubing veins and milk-blood.  I'm glad I've never seen an Alien movie android ripped open before.  Having never seen a ripped open Android made finally seeing it a real surprise.  If I'd seen that before in a prior movie it would have been a let-down.  Then the giant alien starts piloting his spaceship (which he drives with a flute...yes a flute) on a mission to travel to Earth to wipe us out for good because I guess they didn't get it right last time.  The movie theorizes the aliens created us and want to destroy us now.  This makes no sense to the crew and less sense to audience.  You know you have problems when the characters IN the movie struggle with the plot.  Noomi escapes the ship just as it launches into the air.  The Prometheus crew, upon being warned via radio that the ship is headed to Earth, immediately decide to ram the spaceship with their own ship, killing themselves in the process. They make this decision immediately.  After the ramming, the gigantic ship comes falling out of the sky, hits the ground butt first, and begin falling in gigantic slow motion like a giant space croissant.  Noomi is in danger of being smashed as this thing looms over her.  She can simply run to her left or right, side-stepping the falling craft.  Or she can run in a straight line, leaving her in the impact zone of the craft as it falls through the air.  What does she do?  Of course, she runs in a straight line, the giant ship finally crashing to the ground inches behind her heels.

In summary, some more stuff happens in these final minutes of the film.  And the stuff that happens is dumb.  Very dumb. Groan inducing dumb.  It also tries to play the ""If you don't get the story, then this movies is too smart for you"" card.  But in reality, you won't get this movie because it's sense of logic is ethereal at best.  At worst, it's an expensive mess with a neon sign above it blaring ""Style over Substance Sold Here!""  This is why I think this movie happened.  First, it's Ridley Scott and he wanted to do an alien movie.  Nuff said (almost).  And I'm sure Ridley Scott and his production shop worked up some fantastic concept art for this film.  Indeed, the film looks incredible if not quite ground-breaking as Blade Runner or Alien.  The set-design is impeccable with an organic, lived in look that makes the sterile CGI worlds Lucas created for the Star War prequels look like cartoons.  So I think Scott said, I'm gonna make this flick look cool.  As for the story, he through a couple of hundred grand at some script writers and said, ""I want a chest bursting scene and at least one android ripped apart, aside from that, I don't care.""  Well folks, in Prometheus, that's exactly what you get:  A very cool looking movie, a chest bursting scene, a ripped apart android, and a bunch of I don't care.  The trailer for this film was a excellent.  Watch that instead and do something else with the 120 mins you save yourself.",1349136000,36,8384,4.7162534435261705

You have a fearless female heroine enduring all thte hardships one can imagine, ego driven men who are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, hostile alien worlds, futuristic space travel and exploration, alien intelligence that surpasses that of the humans, an android with sinister programing who is still charming and then you come to the end of the movie....and are completely let down by a director's sophmoric turn and plot device that deliberately shys from the obvious implied by the film and throughout to some giddy school boy ""moral quest"" and ""hope"".
Riddley Scott certainly knows how to tell a good tale, to capture the audience however, he does not know how to or when to stop...and so he ruins the whole damn thing.
The lesson here is that it is better to quit while you're ahead but he did not do it.
I'm not at all certain I will add this to my DVD collection along with the Alien movies, Blade Runner and others.  I was very disappointed.",1349136000,3,1214,4.6465116279069765
4795960,1,B005LAIHY0,"Rather then write a whole review, I realized I'd already done pretty much that while replying to a shameful post glorifying this film as legitimate ""genius"". So out of little more then sheer laziness, I'll just copy the reply. Ridley, you made me do this! (and your inept untalented writers)

The aged Mr. Scott has indeed lost his cool. This is one of the biggest insults he's even inflicted upon his fans, and this is coming from someone who adored him earlier in his career.

Tragic, what this film could-have been.

But, don't despair. The true value of this film almost completely makes up for how disappointed we are in Sir Scott, and his overwhelmingly pathetic/lazy writers. Prometheus is a brilliant barometer!

Not until now has there been a more exceptional method for differentiating those who are easily enthused and manipulated by (stereotypical and tired) eye-candy, mediocrity (masquerading as brilliance), and generic/wooden acting/storyline/conclusions. This film is, to date, the single best film for accessing the stylistic ignorance or awareness of anyone you have questions about.

Does it mean anyone who likes this film is an idiot? Of course not. That, is the pitfall of anyone who is hyper-enthusiastic, yet ignorant, when damning anyone who doesn't share his/her highly biased views.

Which again, is why I LOVE this film. It clearly separates those who, until now, had only a thin veil between them, to most observers, at least. Seeing the difference between a full-blown dullard, and someone who isn't, is simple. Do people really think that takes a keen eye? But this film helps identify less easily-discernible types. Those being:

A: Those who are fairly aware, fairly intelligent, yet stylistically sheeplike and prone to eating what they are fed, adore overly melodramatic music telling them how to feel at any given moment, and who invariably pat themselves on the back when not-so-cleverly hidden clues, foreshadowing, or subplot devices (which completely baffle the truly ignorant) arise. Oh the joy they feel!

B: Those who aren't so easily overjoyed by mediocrity, (Especially when it comes from directors who not only lack mediocrity, but who literally changed the overall environment of cinema earlier in their careers), like to stay as aware as their craniums will allow, and understand that there are many levels above them on the ladder of art/wisdom/intellect/awareness/empathy/principles, and they aren't even remotely that high up. (buffoons usually think they are pretty high on that hypothetical ladder, bless their hearts)

Type A and B, usually, are harder to tell apart. At least, prior to being invited to their homes and seeing what their Kmart-inspired ideas of ""art"" really are.

[said a previous reviewer who loved it]

""Charlize Theron plays the ice-cold bitch perfectly""

Sure, if by ""perfectly"" you mean laughably stereotypical and villainous on the level of a Disney film. If she had a mustache, she certainly would have been twirling it. Charlize phoned-in that silly over-the-top performance, yet this person applauds it? What does this say? Quite a bit, actually. This film didn't have characters, it had caricatures and stereotypes. Didn't notice it? Then sadly, you might be part of group A. But hey, don't hate the messenger. The truth is a bitter-tasting and nasty pill. Who likes medicine? Not me! But, I'll take it every day of the week rather then the sweet sweet candy of ignorance, the delicious flavors of conformity, and the beautiful tones from the flute of complacency.
(Group A members, can leave it anytime they want, BTW.)

[and again from the same reviewer]

""In closing, ""Prometheus"" is a genius piece of science fiction art""

(Yikes! This is unintentional comedy, I am sorry to say. Once again I implore you all to use this film as the perfect barometer which I strongly suspect it is.)

Well in my own closing, I say, learn to recognize the signs. There are plenty more quotes I could use from the previous review, but why? This film, and this individuals review, teaches many lessons FAR more important then simply reviewing a current film. But, to get back to the point of a film review, this film is childish, lazy, pathetic, generic, and much much MUCH more. Unlike nearly all of his films from his better days, I couldn't even watch it twice, though I tried.

Don't be so manipulated, kiddies. It's easy, I know, ""Path of least resistance, blah blah blah"", and all that. But take away a valuable lesson from this persons review, which is simply: enthusiasm and awareness don't play very well together. Don't be sheep, be people. Appreciate true genius. There is nothing more unfortunate then when someone calls the utterly mundane, ""genius"".

It hurts to admit Ridley has lost it, but his last several films suggested as much, and now this one shouts it loudly. And those writers? Oh geeze. Deus ex machina's ALL OVER the damn place. I especially love the Lucas-esque past, which is MORE advanced then the future? Well done, lads! Wouldn't a less-is-more, lower-tech, gritty approach have benefited this film better, while adding an addition layer of legitimacy within the world which Ridley himself created? Nope.

And dear super-motivated reviewer, I don't know exactly how many times a term as extreme as ""genius"" could be applied to a film, it certainly hasn't happened too damn much, and even less lately. You diminish the term by using it on this mass-appeal, CGI-fest, forgettable prequel. Save your massive enthusiasm for a film which deserves it, instead of one which panders to the lemmings.

Now get out there people, and use the barometer! It works!

[and motivated by the reviewers glowing and astonishing praise of how legendary and timeless the ""squid"" scene was going to be]

(I just can't help myself:  No, the baby-squid-stupidity doesn't even barely come close to rivaling anything, much less the original chest-burster scene. Who would suggest such a thing? We'll meet back here in a few years, and see if your predictions about it being an iconic visual masterpiece are correct. However, it's only been a few months, and guess what? It seems to have already been forgotten. Can't really say that about the original Alien, oui? Don't be offended, just step up your game, hommie.)",1349136000,10,6288,5.054106280193237
4795961,2,B005LAIHY0,"There are so many things about Prometheus that I think are amazing, but there are just as many things that completely destroys it as well.

First off finding a planet by using cave paintings as your map makes no sense what so ever. Everything in space moves and changes so how could cave maps that are thousands of years old still work?

Secondly the crew of the ship is utterly wrong. Instead of having intelligent people working together, we have what feels like monkeys playing around and banging on things. It just makes no sense and this quite frankly destroyed a big chunk of the movie. I keep thinking about the moon landing back in 60's and I wonder if the crew acted anything like the crew in the movie. I'm guessing more than likely they were proper scientist embarking on a mission, not a bunch of bumbling idiots that do not belong anywhere near a ship, space or an alien planet. We have the 2 laid back scientists, a Scottish soccer beer drinking buffoon, the evil cold bitch running the ship, a robot who looks like the lead character in Lawrence of Arabia, a couple of guys driving the ship that look like the type of guys that would hi five and say bro all the time, some other guys that are just here to die like in Startrek and plenty more colourful characters. These people are just not realistic especially 80 something years in the future and you can easily tell that these personalities are here to play all too familiar roles. Is it impossible to make a movie based around actual proper scientists and how they would act and react in these sort of situations?

My 3rd problem with this movie is how the crew go about their business. Let's swap out the scientists for some soldiers, would you A. plan out your mission, find out any and all information you can about the structure you're about to explore and take the necessary precautions to ensure your crew were safe or B. land on a planet, run straight over to the structure and start firing at the first thing you see? Sadly B is the answer this crew picked. Who in hell would land on a planet, go straight to the structure without running a FULL diagnostic, run willy nilly into it without waiting and then just fool around touching things, taking off helmets and playing with doors without knowing what might happen. For god sakes they didn't even run a full life scan first! Who knows what these creatures are capable of, but who cares let's just go explore and see what happens. Here's a little run down of how things go. The crew finds a dead alien, while they look at the alien, David decides to open the door and Shaw's says ""we don't know what is behind that door"". They didn't know anything about anything anyways so why is she worried about what's behind the door? Okay yes they did scan the corridors that they were in but there could have been booby traps, diseases and an untold amount of dangerous things that they didn't know about so why is she so worried what's behind the door, it's not like they cared about anything else. My favorite funny moment is when the 2 guys run off because they are scared, but when they encounter life they decide to investigate. Didn't they try to leave because they were scared?, now they're going to play with some snake thingy's. This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on forever about what was done wrong.

My last problem with this movie is the fact that this was supposed to be a stand alone movie from the Alien franchise, when in fact it is completely a prequel hiding behind mythology. Just because they focused so much of the movie on how humans evolved and their creators doesn't mean it doesn't have everything to do with the other Alien movies.

Overall there is some amazing ideas, acting and visual effects in this movie and for some people that may be enough. I myself enjoyed the mythology and the idea that we came from gods, but the story is hindered by all the problems.",1349049600,13,3925,4.46100278551532
4796052,5,B005LAIHY0,"While most of the reviews I have seen so far regarding the release of Prometheus on Blu-ray have done a fine job at criticizing much of the movie and director for some reason, I would just like to review the features list for this release in particular.  According to recently released specs, the 3D 4 disc set is the one to go for.  On Amazon.com there is no indication of the special features list for either the 2 or 4 disc versions, but evidently this release, the 3D version, is the one that will have an extra special features disc and is actually referenced as the ""Collector's Edition"" release.  The additional features available on both the 2 and 4 disc sets are as follows:
Disc 1
*Theatrical Cut
*Commentary by Director/Producer Ridley Scott
*Commentary by Writer Jon Spaihts and Writer/Executive Producer Damon Lindelof
*""The Peter Weyland Files""
*Deleted and Alternate Scenes that include an Alternate Opening / Ending
*Prometheus - Weyland Corp Archive Second Screen App

Disc 2
*DVD / Digital Copy

The four disc has these additional extras:

Disc 3
*3D Theatrical Cut of Movie

Disc 4
*""The Furious Gods: Making Prometheus""
*Enhancement Pods
*Weyland Corp Archive
*Pre-Vis
*Screen Tests

So for those of you, like me, that really enjoy the extras (and by the way the trailer video for the 4 disc set leads with the words ""questions will be answered"" and references Planet LV-426 and the Alien tie-in questions that other reviewers mention as faults with the movie), this is the one to go for.",1348876800,117,1508,4.817829457364341
4796053,1,B005LAIHY0,"New review - 3D blu-ray (watched 12/7/2012):
Ok, so the one thing I did enjoy in the original viewing was the visuals of the movie, and that was in 2D since I didn't want to drive farther and pay more to see the 3D version.  However, shortly after release on Blu-ray, Black Friday came and the studio was blowing these things out already for 12.99 and since I am a huge fan of 3D I bought it.

I have about the best setup for viewing 3D at home one can get: DLP Projector (No cross-talk, ghosting) bright lamp (1600 Lumens), highly reflective large screen (retro-reflective 1.8 Gain gray, 120 inches), and eye level projector placement (maximizes light output of projector returned to the viewers).  Also I have a 7.2 speaker setup so compared to the neighborhood cinemaplex I was guaranteed to have a better audio and visual experience.  It turned this turd into a ""watchable"" movie to the point that I can say I will re-watch it in the future - but always in 3D.  I'd revise to 1.5 stars but Amazon does not support that capability so it stays at 1!

You may have a better experience If you love Damon Lindelof's writing in general.  To me he's a hack that has no idea where his plots are going so leaves holes you can drive a semi through, then allows his viewers to make up whatever they want as the reasons and finally, he may even take those ideas and build them into the sequel or the next TV season.  Example: Here's what it would look like if Lindelof was writing the pivotal scene in Se7en:

Set scene: Freeman (Det. Somerset) chooses to leave the box closed while his partner Pitt (Det. Mills) waits.
Pitt: ""What's in the box?""  Freeman: ""Guess.""  Pitt: ""Why don't you just tell me what's in the box?""  Spacey (John Doe): ""Even I don't know. Remember Schrdinger's cat?""
End Movie.

Original Review:
I went into the theater with zero expectations, and came out with poo on my shoe. I scraped it off, but the stench was imprinted on my brain. Luckily, in the aftermath of seeing Lethal Weapon 3 and 4, Alien 3 and 4, Matrix 2 and 3, and Star Wars ep. 1,2, and 3, I've trained myself well on how to do a ""mind wipe"".  Now I'm getting more anxious about Jackson and his 2, strike that, 3 Hobbit movies... p.s., plenty of other reviewers have covered in depth all the reasons why this movie reeks, so I chose the more visceral route.",1348790400,8,2339,4.409302325581395
4796054,3,B005LAIHY0,"Do not buy this movie in any format until you know, for fact that, the additional 60 minutes cut out of the theatrical version, are added in. The theatrical version of this movie (if you're an Aliens and Ridley Scott fan) will feel rushed and choppy. So many pieces of the narrative are left hanging and the characters appear as shallow as a B-movie horror flick. ""Hey that guy died. Was I supposed to care about him?"" All of the digital pre-releases are talking about an additional ""60 minutes"" of footage that can be viewed. But are they IN the movie. Immediately after seeing this movie in the theater my impression was ""that would be a completely different movie if it had like another 45 minutes in it."" Not that I'm some kind of film genius, but if you had this cast, this story and the brilliance of Ridley Scott, would you make this short, pretty, drop-in-the-bucket of a film?

Every aspect from the creature design to the dialogue was under par and should have been sharpened and scrutinized just a bit more for the dynasty's sake.

They don't move the series forward and damn, I really did want to be frightened by this film rather than roll my eyes.  Yes, The Alien series is a dynasty built on Scott's original vision that deserves a ton of respect.

4796276,1,B005LAIHY0,"Are your survival skills as finely honed as the scientists aboard Prometheus? Let's find out...

You, a scientist, have landed on a distant planet with a team of fellow scientists in search of alien life. What would you do in the following scenarios?

1. Upon first arrival and entrance into what appears to be a manufactured cave structure, you deploy very high tech scanning and mapping probes. Do you:
A) Also send out your android crew member to evaluate any possible danger and then wait for the probes to finish scanning and mapping before you begin exploring?
B) Brazenly charge forward into the unknown and maybe consult your equipment's discoveries later, shrugging off any blips of alien life as an equipment malfunction?

2. While traveling through the cave structure on this alien planet you discover the presence of oxygen in the air. Do you:
A) Keep your space helmet secured tightly because there may be any number of unknown elements, pathogens, bacteria, contagions, and other toxic substances in the atmosphere that are undetectable by your equipment?
B) Quickly remove your helmet AFTER stating what an idiotic idea it is because a fellow teenage scientist, who has properly tested the air by taking a few shallow breaths, peer-pressures you into it?

3. Your android crew member appears to have quickly learned the language of the inscriptions found within the cave. Do you:
A) Ask him to translate everything and share his wealth of knowledge from that point forward?
B) Treat him like a red-headed step child and ignore him for the rest of the mission?

4. As scientists on a mission in search of alien life, you stumble upon a deceased alien life form in the cave structure. Do you:
A) Restrain your excitement at the discovery and prepare to study, take samples, and test further?
B) Piss your pants in fear and then while attempting to return to the ship you run in random directions until you are lost within the caves, refusing to consult the mapping tools you brought with you even though you happen to be THE expert in their usage?

5. After becoming lost within the caves you learn of a storm outside that will prevent you from returning to the ship until morning. Do you:
A) Break out your mapping tools to help determine your location and plot your exit strategy; or still refusing that logic, simply ask the crew on the ship to help guide you through the caves with their 3D map which includes your location?
B) Decide that exploring deeper into the caves to frighten yourself further with more deceased alien discoveries is probably the most logical thing you can be doing with your spare time?

6. After wandering through the entire haunted-house cave structure you decide to enter the initial room that frightened you off in the first place; unfortunately you then come face to face with a living alien that resembles a large snake which begins posturing and hissing at you like a king cobra. Do you:
A) Shoot it in the face and run for your miserable life?
B) Decide that you are only afraid of dead aliens and not live ones, and then try to pet the aggressive alien snake with your hand?

7. Upon the discovery of a 2000 year old decapitated alien head which has been wondrously preserved, you bag the head in your trusty ziplock and return to the ship with your trophy for testing. Do you:
A) Take a sample and have a look at its DNA first?
B) Recalling your fond memories of Frankenstein, you inject stem cells into its locus coeruleus to re-animate it and increase the amps until the alien head explodes; and then you run your tests?

8. You manage to collect a small sample of a strange black goop in the caves, which appears to be alive. Do you:
A) Put a drop onto a slide and take a look under a microscope?
B) Decide that the scientific method of small children will yield the best and quickest results and so you secretly put a drop into a drink which you then give to a scientist to see what happens?

9. You have become incredibly sick with some unknown illness and witness an alien larva worm crawl out of your eye. Do you:
A) Quarantine yourself and ask the other crew members to help treat your condition immediately?
B) Pretend that nothing is amiss and you feel fine, then romp about as usual with the rest of the crew until you collapse half-dead?

10. After a contagion outbreak and another scientist lost to death-by-alien-snake, the missing scientist left for dead in the caves returns to the ship as a zombie spider monkey. Do you:
A) Leave the door tightly secured until you can determine the status of the unresponsive crew member with the variety of cameras located on the ship?
B) Open the door and go out alone to investigate, then kick the creature while turning your back to it until it smashes your face in with its zombie strength?

11. You come face to face with an Engineer, the creator of humans, after waking him from hypersleep. Do you:
A) Attempt to speak his language and introduce yourself, your crew, and your mission?
B) Barrage him with fat mama jokes until he becomes an enraged Neanderthal and tears your head off with his bare hands?

12. A disc shaped spaceship rolls towards you in the final moments of its crash landing. Do you:
A) Run ten yards to the right or left, perpendicular to the ship's path, and let it roll on by?
B) In the heat of the moment you forget about the steamroller scene from Austin Powers, and so for a full minute you attempt to outrun the crashing town-sized spaceship by following its trajectory as it slowly barrels towards you?

How did you do? Total your score and share it in the comments!
All  A's = 1 point
All  B's = 0 points

Hopefully you managed better than the total of ZERO scored by the characters plucked straight out of a teenage slasher film to masquerade as scientists in the movie Prometheus!

4796280,4,B005LAIHY0,"I thought the movie started off strong, it seemed to pull me in, and I thought it was extremely interesting watching the first part. A lot of people claim that this movie had stunning visuals, but I thought for a Science Fiction movie it had what it needed to. The one thing I would say was a little over the halfway mark I felt that the story got a little sloppy, and had a lot of elements that were typical in a lot of other films. This movie though had the potential to be a really great film, if they had focused more on the plot, and had the disease be the primary enemy. Like at the beginning of the film when the alien is exposed to the disease and dies instantly, why then when the human that is exposed to it in the film after he's burned alive come back to life? It's almost like two inconsistencies, and I just wanted them to have sticked to one, I thought it was lame that the one guy came back to life after being dead. I guess I was looking for more realism. Secondly, there's no life anywhere, so where do those eel things come from? I think they were looking for action when it wasn't necessary. It would have made sense if they came to that place and discovered it was an old military base where they engineered this disease or microb and it started killing them, but to have the eels and inconsistent deaths to me just ruined it.",1348272000,3,1347,4.184615384615385
4796451,4,B005LAIHY0,"In Greek Mythology Prometheus presumed to steal fire from the gods for the progress of mankind. He was banished, punished and bound for daring to interfere with domain of the gods.

Similarly the author of Frankentein called her book the modern Prometheus, where a scientist presumed to usurp the very process of creation itself, and created a monster using lightning.

In Prometheus the movie scientist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace, and her partner makes a series of scientific discoveries which shows that we were put here by extraterrestrials, and embark on a funded mission to a distant planet to meet these aliens.

While the scientists aims are pure other people on board have mixed agendas. We have a soulless humanoid played by Michael Fassbender, and a ruthless female leader played by Charlize Theron and the mysterious owner of the company.

Director Ridley Scott directed the Aliens series starring Sigourney Weaver, and I think Prometheus will please fans of Aliens and win new fans. Like Aliens we have a heroic female protagonist played by Noomi Rapace from the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series. Their arrival on the planet sets in motion a series of events with implications beyond the mission.

While it appears to be a dead planet there is mischief on board the craft and danger on the planet itself.

The alien planet is menacing as you expect, (so rarely do we meet friendly aliens), and if there are alien life forms they may not be friendly.

There are several surprises and some well crafted scenes, which were quite originally done, including the duffel bag, and an improvised medical procedure which I found highly intriguing.

One of my favorite lines from the movie: 'We may have gotten off on the wrong foot.'

I love movies with a strong female protagonist, and Noomi Rapace really excels at this type of role. If you have seen the Alien movies, I think you will appreciate that he has given a style of science fiction that he pioneered a fresh and interesting twist. Who can forget that famous scene with John Hurt in the original Alien?

Will Prometheus spawn a sequel? You could argue that it already has. I cannot speak as yet to how it will be on Blu Ray except to say that it was a visually stunning experience in the theater.

But what really drove me crazy about this movie, was the incessant background music. A droning muzak that droned on and on during scenes where the acting and dialogue would have sufficed.

4796456,5,B005LAIHY0,"I think some people who are true sci-fi fans and either didn't like this movie initially or were confused on how to feel about it should watch it again.

I watched this the first nite it came out in theatres and everyone was super quiet after the movie ended. I think everyone was processing...This movie doesn't use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience... there isn't really a constant feed of mind-numbing visual action one would assume. This movie was done tastefully (for the most part) and speaking of good taste...wow, there is a really freaking hot guy in this. Logan Marshall-Green is so friggin' hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him. But prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his. I will not spoil anything but if you're squirmish, get ready!. .

Initially it was hard for me to accept Noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons. I'll just come out and say it: there is something off-putting about her facial structure and hair for me. Her bone structure is maybe just bad on film. I wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face. Not to mention her accent in this. In the end, she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive. I can't say I'm sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented, but I accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing. She really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside.

I love the guy who plays the captain of the Prometheus- Idris Elba. He has a few cheesy lines, but I think he was good for the role. And ya gotta have the black guy! Charlize Theron is, as usual, wonderful to watch. Fassbender was pretty good but I never got why he was such a vindictive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake. Guy Pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man; I wish they would have just used an old man though. Older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man. And I REALLY wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it. I never got a good sense of the layout. One of the things I didn't like about this movie.

SPOILER ALERT! The aliens in the movie are well done. I got so frustrated when the alien doesn't answer Dr. Shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out. In his facial expression, the alien seems moved by her briefly, but then the android steps in and just pisses him off. You'd think Mr. Weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh1t. That is not how you get what you want. No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.

Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film. I wish there were more sci-fi movies in general and I've always been a fan of Aliens (and I'm not too big on scary stuffz). Don't expect perfection from it, despite my 5 star rating. Compared to all the thoughtless garbage Hollywood makes these days, this is a gem...

4796457,2,B005LAIHY0,"Even when discounting the hype, this movie was poorly written. By far, this was the worst movie I have seen that Ridley Scott had anything to do with. I doubt I would ever watch it again. Did Hollywood screw up another great series?

The dialogue alone is extremely amateur, and I kept finding it hard to imagine the characters as professionals, scientists, etc. Many times, the characters' logic, or ability to reason was non-existent. Also note, there was absolutely NO Fear Factor. The commercials I saw for this this movie prior to release were very misleading, as they tried to make it 'appear' as a Sci-Fi Thriller or Scary movie, which it is not. Maybe the joke was on me, but some other viewers I have spoken to feel the same way. I suppose I made the mistake of rushing to the theater the day it premiered without waiting for any feedback.

The plot started out with some great creativity, bringing a completely new takes on aliens, but feel apart quickly. The few attempts at a witty twist during the story and the end fizzled. Numerous attempts to be smart, funny, strong or scary with these characters failed. This is one movie where I wish hadn't wasted my time and money at the theater.

4796459,1,B005LAIHY0,"""THE TRICK, WILLIAM POTTER, IS NOT MINDING THAT IT SUCKS.""
David Ex Machina ... The Magic Plot Robot

That statement succinctly encapsulates the psychological crux of The Apologists for this weak film, ""Prometheus""; a film that never rises above being a paltry attempt at quality and sophistication by piggy-backing a money-in-the-bag, kit-bashed franchise with a tired, tawdry decorum of Greek mythology, quasi-Oedipal/pseudo-Shakespearean familial neuroses, and trickerated cookie-cutter stock characters. Basically, this is what happens when the conceptual and thematic becomes married to the pretentious and banal. This film is what happens when the story concept of ""structure"" becomes a deaf-dumb buzzword; this story is what happens when you become too comfy-cozy with the Big Hollywood Industrial Complex; when profundity becomes diluted in a rationalized 'Loud, Dumb & Obvious' school-of-thought; when a filmmaker apparently becomes intoxicated with the guaranteed myth of his own ""Visionary"" label; when said filmmaker's projected response to logical critique is his own precedental ""Don't Try And Rationalize With Me""; when a film is made with an in-built, plausibly deniable, schizoid nature that simultaneously denies being a 'direct, solid' prequel (that merely has ""strands of Alien DNA"") while possessing a structure, idiom, and iconography that is not only wholly predicated on that first film, but betrays a shallow, derivative creativity. Apparently, the conceptual premise of ""Prometheus"" entailed the exploration of 'something' derived (or inspired) from the Alien mythos (or should I stress, in this case, FRANCHISE),but the result lacked any profundity or any actual 'exploration' (theological/existential discussions with disembodied android heads notwithstanding).I find it almost mind-boggling to what degree this film is rife with plot 'illogic'. There is a sustained stream of sappy, simplistic narrative, dramatic oddities and weaknesses that just keep on begging frustrating questions.

The characters are extremely stupid and uninteresting, as was the entire plot.  I really thought this was a cerebral film, from many of the previews, but it turn out to be a truly horrible monster movie, with a mess that left a massive door for a sequel.

I downloaded this in the early digital version, and I wish I had Redbox this garbage, as it would have saved me some bucks!

- The plot is generic, science team sent to investigate planet, science team finds discovery to shake the foundation of our understanding, the discovery turns out to be a monster.
- The monsters are generic mix of biological and physical ghoulies.

4796626,4,B005LAIHY0,"One thing people need to clearly understand about this film is that Ridley Scott has stated on several occasions that this is not a prequel to Alien. It does hint at several points through out the movie (ending mostly) things that might tie into the movie Alien, but it is a completely different storyline. I personally watch the film with low expectations (which is what I would recommend for some). Some people will quite frankly hate this movie. I am a huge fan of the first 2 Alien films; the others clearly should have never been made. Ridley Scott is a brilliant imaginative person, with the film Prometheus you see stunning landscapes, which will set a perfect stage for an alien world. The futuristic technology is very believable and alone makes the movie worth watching. The dark-grim feel of the movie reminds me very much of the film Alien and delivers the same suspenseful feel that Alien brought. The actors and actresses are brilliant and are clearly the strong point of the movie. Several people may be bothered by some of the characters behavior, but this is a movie (and yes people do stupid things in movies). Over all the performances are very well done.
I would say the weaker points of the movie are parts of the storyline. Some people may be bothered by the idea that we came to existence because of an alien race. Once you get past this idea and the except that it is clearly a science fiction movie the film can be quite enjoyable. I find the new alien characters very fascinating and by the end of the film I want to know more about them. As said before it's a new storyline, don't be upset that we didn't get all the questions answered we had about the movie Alien. After all what makes a good sci-fi movie is the unknown, and of course always leaves us with wanting more and we will probably know more in the 2nd Prometheus film.

While I wanted to like this film; Ridley should have stepped in and made changes to the script.

This prequel is to be part of a trilogy, according to Scott.  Where is he going to go from here?  I'd make Prometheus a dream if I were a director.

4796722,5,B005LAIHY0,"When we ask someone, ""you wanna meet your maker?"", we're basically asking them if they want to die.  You hear that phrase a lot in action movies.  Take that phrase and let us consider its meaning in a literal sense.  Do you want to meet your maker?  Most people would answer a definite yes.  And that is the underlying theme of this ambitious, thought-provoking movie.  Throughout the eons, man has been longing to meet his maker.  Various belief systems have arisen to address this very desperate longing.  But, what would happen if technology has advanced to the point where this desire of the human heart can now be fulfilled?

This movie was inspired by the works of the Swiss author, Erich Von Daniken.  He was the one who had originally proposed the idea that an advanced race of space travelers have visited Earth in the distant past.  And not only that, these ancient visitors have had an impact on the development of civilization, technology, and perhaps even the human species itself.  The works of Zacharia Sitchin have also had a clear influence on the themes of the movie.  Sitchin's works have claimed that a group of advanced humanoids called the Anunaki have influenced ancient humans and their ways of life.

The premise of the movie is that a pair of researchers uncovered ancient clues that space travelers may have visited Earth in the past.  Cave paintings and drawings, from diverse geographical locations and different time periods, all indicated the same symbol.  The symbol is a unique star formation.  A star map.  Within the drawings, there is always a figure of a tall humanoid pointing to the stars.  The researchers concluded that this meant an invitation from the ""Star People"" to mankind.  With the help of Weyland Industries, the researchers embark on a long journey to the distant star system shown on the star ""map"".  After a two year journey onboard Prometheus (the ship), the research team is woken up from their deep sleep and arrives at the destination.  Among the crew is an android, David.  David is an advanced, synthetic humanoid created by the CEO of Weyland Industries.

The Prometheus descends on the planet, entering its atmosphere.  Analysis showed that the atmosphere will not support humans.  Donning on their protective gear, the crew sets off to investigate a mysterious structure on the planet's surface.  The structure seems to have been artificial, not natural.  Upon entering the structure, they discover the remnants of what appears to be an alien scientific base camp.  Further exploration took the crew to a temple-like room, littered with metallic cylinders.  An unknown black substance is oozing out of some of the cylinders.  David, with his superior intellect, discovers a recorded hologram of events that took place on the facility more than two thousand years ago.  Meanwhile, Drs. Shaw and Ford decides to bag a preserved alien head in order to take it back to the Prometheus for further study.

I don't want to spoil the plot for you.  Suffice it to say that the ending will be a surprise.  The reasons for David's mysterious behavior and strange choices will be revealed as the plot unfolds.  Yes, the crew will end up finding a living specimen.  And those acid-blooded creatures from ""Alien"" do make an appearance.

Technically, Ridley Scott has said that this movie is not a direct prequel to ""Alien"".  However, it was inspired by that film franchise, as well as by the works of the authors mentioned above.  HR Geiger's artwork and style also dominate the movie sets.  As you may know, Geiger designed the original Alien.  He also designed Sil, creature in the movie ""Species"".  And clearly, the same ferocious creatures in the Alien franchise also are present and wreaking havoc in this film.  The special effects are what you would expect of a high-budget Ridley Scott movie.  Everything about this movie is top-notch.  And that includes the nearly all-star cast.

This is the best science fiction movie that I have seen in a long time.  If you are looking for movie in this genre that offers more than action thrills and special effects, then this is it.  And, you will be pleased to know that unlike some of those other ""cerebral"" Sci-Fi movies that start off slow, this one actually gets off to a fairly fast start.

4796724,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm a die hard fan of Scott's Alien (and Aliens).  When I heard David Lindelof (of the TV show Lost) was chosen to finish the script I admittedly cringed a little.  He's a superb writer but I am not always a fan of his style.

I understand the criticisms lodged at the movie/writers/actors and I don't think they are all unwarranted.  O'Bannon's script for Alien was so tight.  It was his baby and it came long before Scott and Giger came aboard for the project. Plus, the acting was flawless.

Scott and Lindelof said repeatedly that this was NOT a prequel to Alien.  Scott wanted to take the motifs/themes and go in a different direction.  I think the theme was lofty (the origins of humanity) and fell flat with some viewers.  The plot twists and subplots were difficult to accept or believe at times.  You have to understand that's Lindelhof's approach, not the absence of any creativity per se.
There are some intelligent interpretations of the film on youtube worth watching.

IMHO The acting is wooden, the dialogue embarrassingly dumb, stunning visual effects,lighting & sets are not enough to make a great movie.

For all his promises that this wouldn't just be a direct prequel to Alien, the director sure seems to stretch this concept to bring the two films together, rarely to the benefit of either. That's a pity, because while the core questions that Prometheus has to ask are worthwhile if not unique, its constant urge to poke and prod several of Alien's richest, most eccentric mysteries keep it tethered to the ground floor. A more compassionate cast may have smoothed over some of those rough spots, but this tight squad of explorers is thoroughly cold and conniving, naive and unlikable at their best. I wanted to adore this, and for the whole of the concept-heavy first act I did, but by the onset of the final standoff I'd been bucked like a fledgling cowboy.

The aliens seeding Earth with life having their DNAdisperse in a river? A rough star map thousands of years old exactly matching some group of stars somewhere not visible with naked eye? Stars move, you know! And why would they point at a desolate planet where the mismatched crew found a bioweapon cache base? And of could theDNA human and of the engineers match oerfectly after thousands of years?
The crew sent by a geezer tycoon who believes the ""Creators"" engineers will give him immortality (?) is composed by one utterly amoral robot who finds a strangge black goo in one capsule and proceeds to put that goo in the drink of a crew  member for an experiment and a mismatched, bumbling crew. Two of said crew map the tunnels in an alien ""pyramid"", then get lost, encounter a pool of the black goo from wich a nasty looking snake thing emerges, and try to make friends with it. Disaster obviously ensues, in a movie best called Alien Reloaded. The engineers' ship is identical to the one in Alien, and after a thousand years of inactivity it functions perfectly with stunning holographic effect, maintaining one of the Engineers in stasis.

4796730,4,B005LAIHY0,"I Saw this on opening night which was also on my birthday. So viewing it was extra special since Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time. A Blu-ray release will be a definite must because the cinematography was superb in this movie. The alien world and ship(s) settings are remarkably beautiful and felt real. The acting was top notch with kudos to Michael Fassbender being the most memorable. The beautiful Noomi Rapace and seriousness of Charlize Theron also helped push Prometheus narrative as well. Of course, the hate comments I read after this movie was released make it not perfect, as usual:

""this is not a direct Alien sequel, but only based in the universe."" Duh, we knew this from the beginning, Why is this hump hard to get over, dumb metacritic reviewer?
Scientific fact nerds will be nit picky... even though we know it's a sci-fi film. Do we really need to point out every great sci-fi films problems? The movie is set in the future and on out of this world ideas.  Just Go with it!
The story was cliched and predictable, even though, wait, why are these guys lost? Okay that doesn't make sense, but oh well.

My biggest problem and the only constructive argument that I agreed on was, what exactly does the main plot device actually do? In Alien, the xenomorph monster was easy to understand. In Prometheus, Ridley Scott and writers loaded the black goo monster mechanic into a plot shotgun and shot the effects everywhere making it hard to figure out what exactly is the menace here. So Scott's films of the past, it seems that a need for a director's cut is in need.
So with that in mind, this may not be THE copy of Prometheus to own at the time. However, I still liked what I watched and I beleive that of all the movies releases lately with a director's commentary, this may be the one if you are seeking possible answers to questions of the film.. It did suck me back into the Weyland/Utani cooperate future of the Alien universe. That certain setting I love to see where once again, they make things more dangerous for human life than they intended. For a recently released sci-fi film of the past five years, this is still a great theatrical viewing. Not perfect like District 9, but entertaining nonetheless.",1347667200,4,2241,4.58354114713217
4796821,2,B005LAIHY0,"Director Ridley Scott has again caused a stir among his fans with the spring 2012 release of ""Prometheus"", a science fiction/horror film which is ultimately a loose, muddled prequel to a much superior series of films: ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection"". Scott also directed ""Alien"" which was released in 1979 and is now considered one of the great triumphs of the science fiction genre. The primary question seems to be whether this film ought to be judged against its predecessors or merited on its own. Ridley Scott situates himself among the greatest science fiction directors of all time: Stanley Kubrick (2001), Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), George Lucas (Star Wars) and John Carpenter (The Thing). My favorite film of Scott's is ""Bladerunner""; a Philip K. Dick adapted futuristic dystopia focusing on a grim and dark Los Angeles governed by detached corporation magnates. Scott put a tremendous amount of time and effort into this film. His potential for another great science fiction film is clear, and I suggest that it is quite relevant to measure a long-awaited prequel in relationship to Scott's earlier cinematic achievements. Consequently, I make no reservations that this response draws consistent parallels to Scott's earlier films.

The cast is assembled with all of the hot new talent - Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw, the intrepid archeologist; her lover and fellow scientist, Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green; Michael Fassbender as David (the synthetic); and Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, the cold yet pragmatic corporate supervisor whose focus never diverges from the interests of the Weyland Corporation. The very talented Guy Pearce pops up at the end as Peter Wayland himself, an odd casting decision that I think Scott should have taken more consideration of. The actors are all excellent and this ensemble really could have made the film work. In a science fiction movie of this scale, the cast's chemistry is crucial to the story, especially when we are thrilled at their every next move, either individual or collective. I found it hard to care or have compassion for any of the characters which is odd because these are A-list actors.

The film lacks character development which is essential because we are instantly thrown into the idiosyncratic worlds of our heroes and are meant to experience their on-screen, scary situations just as they do. In ""Prometheus"" we are taken right into the action before we have a chance to get to know and to develop interest in the main characters. What makes ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" so special is the introduction of what would become an iconic action/sci-fi/horror hero in Sigourney Weaver. We are poised at her every move. She has energy, courage and resolve unmatched by any previous science fiction film protagonist. ""Ripley"" is truly what made the ""Alien"" series so special. Sigourney Weaver recast the role of women in not only science fiction movies, but across film genres. Noomi Rapace as Shaw simply lacks a main character's energy and enthusiasm. I yearned for a heroine that may if even in a small way match the magic of Ridley Scott's ""Ripley."" This was really disappointing. Following the Homer literary tradition, our hero must be strong and ready for any challenge!

I was really looking forward to watching Guy Pearce in action. He is a phenomenal actor. He is sidelined and given very little on-screen time. Although Pearce is quite good as a morally-bankrupt mogul - the authority behind the whole mission - the question I kept asking myself is why not select an actor closer to Weyland's age. He is an old man. The makeup-job is poor and the plot trajectory does not allow for an interesting foray into Weyland's own story. Michael Fassbender is very good as Weyland's right hand and works in a sinister manner to try and help him achieve his goal of immortality.

Reviewers are almost unanimously praising the movie's special effects. Yes. They are impressive. The world Scott creates here is rivaled only by the meticulous mind of James Cameron in his own recent creation: ""Avatar."" Special effects are commonplace among top films today and are often accepted as a compromise to an intelligent story, interesting characters and a smart script - screenplay. There has never been an occasion that Ridley Scott has not wowed us with his magnificent cinematography, complex sets and rich color palettes. ""Prometheus' "" special effects and visuals do not save the rest of its aspects which are lacking, and this is predictably so with most movies today.

The film is also being praised for a so-called ""philosophical"" premise. What is this - that the film's awkward series of events will lead us to an ultimate conclusion regarding the beginnings of life on Earth? This intrigued me at first, but failed in the end. The films existential questions are at best inconspicuous. The second half of ""Prometheus"" moves us away from the answers and substitutes yet another typical formulaic ending - a failed mission, an anarchic crew, a last-minute take-off and a hero left unscathed. What is the relationship of the ""Humanoids"" to the ""Xenomorphs""? Why is there not even the smallest ounce of camaraderie among the crew? There are opposing agendas among all of the characters. If this was developed in much more detail the film may have really worked. The tenuous relationships between the characters should have been set up more carefully.

As did many of my science fiction peers, I left the movie theater disillusioned with many questions and concerns. Some suggest that this is a good thing because it will enable us to revisit our curiosities when we see the next installment - Perhaps. But I find that when a first-of-a-series movie disappoints in so many ways it is always very difficult to redeem it in subsequent attempts. I wish Ridley Scott the best of luck. To his credit, the film has interested me enough to see if he succeeds next time.",1347580800,11,5992,5.02920443101712

4796823,4,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is a visually stunning and entertaining sci-fi movie that largely succeeds despite having elements of its story which sometimes feel half-baked. Personally, I was drawn in by the visuals and the over-all pacing of Prometheus and had a good enough time with it's eerie atmosphere, shocks and thrills - enough that I was able to overlook some weak characterizations and a story that, despite some big themes, ended up being plagued by implausible details.
  What saves the movie for me is the fact that at the core of the story are some BIG QUESTIONS - about the possible origins of humanity and what our place might be in a bigger universe where we have only begun to understand our place. So few science-fiction movies even ATTEMPT to tackle ideas that have these kinds of implications, so I have to give Prometheus credit for actually TRYING to sail into deeper waters. On the flip-side, Prometheus also had enough thrilling pulp genre trappings (ooh, rocket ships and alien Monsters!) that the 12 year-old inside me was kept happy.
  The things that are really missing in this movie are three-dimensional characters whose motivations make consistant sense. At this point, I have to compare Prometheus with ALIEN - especially because Prometheus trades so freely in the mythology of the universe created by ALIEN. In ALIEN, all the characters were fully realized, distinct from each other, believable, and crucial to the story. Prometheus has too many characters - many of whom are not given much to do and could easily be removed without having any impact on the story whatsoever. Other characters are a little bit too obvious about their purpose - overtly stating their symbolic role, where it would of been more interesting for us to figure that out by their actions as they respond to unfolding events. There are also moments where the actions taken by characters go completely against reasonable logic and even their established motivations - simply bending conveniently to satisfy where the story wants to go.
  For me, the faults were easily overlooked and I was swept up in the hypnotic rhythm of the visuals and the shear SCALE of the thing. I enjoyed the aesthetic sensibility of the production design and the performances of Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, which anchored the movie. Prometheus was a good time and did most everything I expected an ALIEN prequel to do, including giving me a few visceral shocks that were delivered in surprising ways. Prometheus isn't as good as ALIEN, but I was able to enjoy it on its own terms.",1347408000,6,2557,4.921113689095128

Watching the making-of documentary, one really gets the sense of the tremendous amount of skill and care that went into the production design of this film.  It's a shame that the same skill and care was not put into the script or the character development.  It's like the right dress on the wrong girl.

I did have problems playing the documentary, though.  I had to stop and restart it several times, and even unplug my Blu-ray player twice to clear the player's memory.  The disc would freeze in the middle of fast-forwarding, and it had great difficulty returning to the Top Menu of the bonus disc on command, if it responded at all.  The documentary is nearly 4 hours long so it is not practical to watch it in one sitting.  Sometimes it would offer to resume playback at the previous cut-off point, but more often than not I'd have to start from the beginning again and fast-forward and chapter search.  My Blu-ray player is only 4 years old.  I haven't had this issue with other discs.

The movie itself was a beautiful-looking disaster.  It made me sad to watch it because of all the amateurishness in the script and dialogue.

A team of so-called scientists who clearly have no experience as... scientists? A screenplay that makes no effort
what-so-ever to get out of a genre made popular by Hollywood? Insipid dialogues that make you understand why the
""Architects"" of the story want to destroy us? Must i go on? I mean, there are stuff in this movie that are unworthy of a talented director like Ridley Scott. Is this another case of a brilliant director (like Brian DePalma) hitting a wall with a sci-fi flick (like ""Mission To Mars"")? It's Ridley Scott, for crying out loud! The man behind the first ""Alien"" movie and ""Blade Runner"". Knowing how long it takes to work on a movie, knowing how many people question a screenplay during the making of it, how can such a poor film hit the screen? Were there ever someone in the production going like this: ""Wait a minute! This doesn't make any sense at all""?

Who cares about the special effects? At this level of filmaking, we know it's going to be dazzling! It's a given. But what about the story? The characters? the dialogue? their motivation? Their actions? Who the heck directed this movie after all? It is not the same man behind ""Thelma & Louise"" and ""Gladiator"", that's for sure. Maybe it's Michael Bay? That's how bad it is! The level of stupidity is that low.

NASA is currently working the details of a mission to Mars with real astronauts. Do you think they would let men in space with marijuana? Astronauts who look like bikers, pot dealers or what-have-you? Let's say we find a planet that could harbor life. Would it be possible for an astronaut to go up there without having any clue that they might encounter... life? Would it be possible for serious scientists to convince us of this long, risky and costly voyage by simply saying that they just believe in it? On a new planet, even if it's looking exactly like Earth, would it make sense for scientists to take their helmet off in a split of a second, without any analysis first? Analysis, by the way, that would have been made long ago, before even landing on the damn planet. Of course, there is a robot that will endanger the whole mission. Of course, the two ""scientists"" who are the dummest of them all will die first in a horrible way. Of course, there is someone on board who only cares about money and the cost of the mission. Of course there is someone who will keep the whole thing difficult to accomplish. Of course, there is someone who will have a change of faith. Of course, the main lady character will be the only survivor. Also, the love between Noomi Rapace's character and her scientist boyfriend, well i never believed it. No chemistry there. And Charlize Theron's character was too one-dimensional. She actually was the robot of the film. And sorry folks, but even if ""Avatar"" wasn't the best script ever written, it did wonders when it came to making us discover an alien world. After that, a movie who wants to do the same thing must be better or else, what's the point?

When a talented director like Ridley Scott makes an error of judgment like that, it makes you wonder about his previous films. Maybe those films didn't come from his mind, after all. Maybe he is simply a director. Maybe he always was lucky and had great scripwriters. And for this one, he wasn't lucky and he had not-so-good scriptwriters. And since he obviously cannot make the difference between a good story and a bad one, well he did it anyway. That is the only explication. Ridley Scott is not so wise after all. He is simply a doer. A director who directs.

I'm sure it's not that. But c'mon! ""Prometheus"" cannot come from Ridley Scott. It's worthy of Michael Bay, in terms of dialogues and character's motivation. And for the great critic Roger Ebert to praise this film, well it's beyond me. The humans in this film diserves to be eaten by the bad aliens.

Visually, it's flawless. There were also some awful aspects. The less prominent characters were mostly place-fillers. It always bothers me when I only know characters by labels such as biology guy, geology guy, navigator guys, etc., especially when they have pivotal roles. Even worse for me, many of the characters' actions are simply inexplicable in their context. Taking your helmet off on an alien planet? Playing gitchee-gitchee-goo with an alien life form? The science was questionable in many places as well. If the Navigators are ""100%"" genetically identical to us, why would we be so different physically? Yeah, dramatic license, yada, yada, but really, talk about some idiot moves...

That said, Prometheus stimulated so many conversations with friends that I went to see it again. I was shocked to find that I loved it the second time around.

But how about the story? Please don't expect an intelligent and intricate screenplay here because ""Prometheus,"" an indirect prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, is a typical case of Hollywood blockbuster full of sound and fury, a visual extravaganza with so many big plot holes.

Set in 2093, an expedition team of scientists and experts including an archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is sent on a mission to the moon LV-223. This is a trillion-dollar project financed by the Weyland Corporation (the CEO Peter Weyland is played by a nearly unrecognizable Guy Pearce), to discover the ""Engineers"" and secrets about the origin of the humans.

The film starts promisingly, benefitting the veteran director's assured control of scenes, but as the story of ""Prometheus"" (script penned by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) unfolds, you may have a very strong feeling of dj vu. While the film's main theme is very ambitious, each set-piece looks as if borrowed from some other sci-fi films including Ridley Scott's own works.

Michael Fassbender plays an android David. Though Fassbender as always delivers a solid performance, the android's decision making is random and sometimes unaccountable. The way he speaks reminds us of HAL9000, but Fassbender's character behaves more illogically than the computer of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" In fact, there are so many illogical motives and implausible situations in ""Prometheus,"" where characters almost always end up doing things in a wrong way.

Let's spend gazillions of dollars and travel bazillions of miles only to take a couple of doofus to mess about! It's not like they're going to get lost, I mean they have this cool mapping technology, right? Oh, they did? But they won't inevitably get eaten or beaten, right? Honestly, I was ready to leave by that point.

I think someone could take the scenes from this movie and make a more intelligent narrative: Is it some sort of cult? Are they mortal enemies? Who came first? Have these beings evolved so much they are in mortal danger from their own boredom? The makers of this film obviously want us to watch the sequel, but guess what, I'd have a better time speculating with friends than watching another movie about space made by amateurs. I would suggest we all stop subsidizing mediocrity.",1346371200,6,1502,4.551851851851852

4797053,1,B005LAIHY0,"The Good:

1) Great alien special effects, except for the sit down chairs when viewing a certain movie thing, made in China folding chairs for a ""trillion dollar"" project? I guess they ran out of money or the president got stingy or had a whatever moment. The holograms also made no sense, what was with the shitty quality of the alien holograms? That made noooo sense.

The Bad

1-2) Already mentioned two
3) So, in the year 2093, we or the Weyland Corp. is still using rockets? Huuuuuuh? I don't think so. And even the vehicles were still rolling around. Come on, not even hovercraft let alone ground air effect? If ur spending millions on a movie, at least spend a hundred thou on some actual modern day advanced vehicles, but cars? Boring. And they didn't even make much of the inside of the large transport vehicle, at least show off some fancy gadgetry in the thing, like talking vehicles would be nice, or an infrared display toggle or ground penetrating radar undernetah or something high tech! BUT, what the: The laser mapping balls conveniently have antigravity? SO THE LITTLE BALLS GET TO ROAM AROUND GRAVITY FREE, JUST NOT THE MORE IMPORTANT HUMANS WHO MADE THEM! Lame!

4) So they finally get to the new miracle planet, and all these people can do is be lame? Captain lady: ""I love my isolated life pod, love sitting in this chair, just gonna stay in here while we're finally after years arriving to a planet, and one where supposedly our makers live, and I'm gonna be arrogant about it to the top scientists on board too."" Narcissist? What was with the male scientist's bluh attitude? So, he gets back after looking at an alien installation, and then is playing pool alone, is depressed, and, is depressed, yawn. Why isn't he going over the maps of the place and all hyper and excited like those loser computer nerds at NASA during their Mars NWO Gay Pardadiousity landing? ""Weeeeeeee look at me I found our creators yay yay yay weeee now we are finally free of any concept of God we can have gay sex and sex with animals and just whatever and not care anymore yaaay yaaay yaaaay, oh look there's a cool little room of weird stuff in this place look at the video footage oooo see how cool it is? Please care!"" But no, at a dumb pool table, a blah pool table, leaning on it, like he's oh so tired. Were the suits heavy or what? And could you get anymore cliche liberal: a gayish white robot guy, a black guy, an asian guy, and old man, a blonde blue eyed uptight bitchy shoulder pads captain, female and male scientist pair acting all equal, the female scientist goes gungho when scientists come to her to, as seems vaguely implied, force her to have a baby, and she doesn't want it so goes rambo and goes into the bitch woman's lifepod to cut it out herself using high tech gadgetry, and right after being stapled shut is still in rambo mode and running around, and strangely you can no longer see the staples (I guess they'll have to edit that in to make it more clear for the DVD and Bluerays, if they care about consistency). OH, AND OF COURSE, THE BLACK AND ASIAN GUY DIE AT THE END LOL, BUT OF COURSE: THE SCIENTIST WOMAN SURVIVES! But hey, okay, not completely liberal, cuz she goes back for her cross at the end, but of course no preaching, so it's kinda like getting a good luck charm back.

5) What was with the crazed alien survivor? A Kindergrtner might as well have written that part: ""Hey guys, let's just make it so the survivor is just a cool stone-cold tuff guy like Stone Cold in that movie where he goes to South America and destroys everything and beats up the annoying nerdy guy, and then he dies by a monster at the end, oh I know, by that ladies baby, it like survived actually, and turned into a giant killer, land octopus, yeah, that wud be so cooool duuuudes."" Friends, ""Oh God yeah that would be awesome, and then like, she finds another ship and warp drives away to ask what the hell was up with that? To the main alien homeworld!""

6) As usual: no explanation of how magic evolution (or the magic big bang) is possible, it's ""just so"". Yet another false god of the gaps between the heads of libertines.

7) Why in the world did miss ""i know what's best for my body and to abort before seeing what's in me"" ""know"" that ""they"" wanted to ""destroy us"" and who is ""us""? Is ""us"" referring to her expedition partners or Earth? Confusing.",1345939200,10,4372,4.42360248447205
4797054,2,B005LAIHY0,"It is nothing short of sad that Scott churned out such a normal hollywood version of Alien.
Everything is stock, predictable, making this movie actually boring at times.

Yes, it looks great. But it does not look as good as the original, and given how the original looked in 79, this is one is downright lame.

The reasons for why the first movie was good have been talked about for decades and it had allot to do with not doing the wrong things. all of which he does here.

The aliens are now a dime a dozen, all different. Then you have one small alien somewho growing huge by staying in an ER room devoid of organic matter. There is not logic to the aliens, they are tiny, huge, snake like, octopus like, or microbes in slime. then the microbes become worms in the eye. Then a woman gets impregnated by the carier of the eye worms, with a different kind of alien. however, once that alien is removed she is healthy and has no eye worms. and so on.

Worst of all, the human-aliens, who appear to be made out of wax, are seen running for their lives toward the familiar shaped pods full of aliens that are presumably their version of weapons of mass destruction. Not away from, but toward what they know to be death.

Then you have many characters that have no function what so ever, like the Charlie Theron character, why was she there? Or weyland? He was so predictable, anybody saw that coming.

What bothers me most is that lack of anything inovative. The aliens are much much more conventional und unsurprising than H.R.Gigers masterpiece. you will never better giger in this, so stick with it! The look of the ship was more bland und like ""ehh, spaceship"" than the old one.

And the sexiness level was turned down. There is less new ground, less chances taken, here also with regards to the female cast. Who here will pretend he does not remember the scene in the first movie, where weaver puts on that space suit. This was more than 30 years ago. In this flick you got doctors who do not take of their undies, even while having mafor surgery.

If this was NOT scott, and not alien, this would movie would be just another sci fi.

However, there are no where near enough sci fi, and so I am glad they made it. Its better than nothing. But it also proves an old theory: good movie are LUCK, not the director. Exception may have been Lawrence's david lean.

The movie is made watchable by Fassbender, the visiuals, and the references to Lawrence of arabia. My favorite movie of all time and one that shows how to do it right.

Finally, there is bit of a scandal here in the news about how amazon scews its reviews systematically to push good ratings. and it is true that any rating that dislike a product or movie gets massive dings here. But I loved Alien, and this is movie is almost lazy in its attempt to cash in on that.

It has been awhile since I've seen a movie with such depth. It's dealing with questions of who we are, and where we come from - and it's not preaching religion to you, it's dealing with deeper ideas, so that was refreshing. Fassbender as the android was one of those characters that only comes around once and awhile, and that you're blown away by; he was perfect for the role. I thought it was the best film of the summer, yes, even better than Batman. The CGI is unbelievable; I saw it in IMAX 3D, and good lord, I had goosebumps due to a couple of the scenes.

TLDR version: deep questions, yet easily accessible; great characters, especially the android; marvelous CGI - i'm talking about the best in a film to date; and a story that indeed leaves some questions unanswered, but I think that was the point - i'm just crossing my fingers for a sequel.

4797057,1,B005LAIHY0,"I can't even tell you what a disappointment this movie was.  So many others have pointed out the HUGE plot holes, inconsistencies and continuity problems that they've saved me a lot of time and writing.  I will say that the film is gorgeous to look at.  Much of that has to do with the use of good, old fashioned practical effects...like miniatures used for the Star Wars films and huge sets built to human scale.  It makes very little use of CGI.  Because you're looking at REAL sets with REAL creatures, you always feel like these elements are actually in the scene with the actors because...the ARE, and it adds realism that most movies that depend on CGI today lack.

That's the best thing about this movie.  Don't expect a cohesive story at all.  I knew the problems were going to be big when the space explorers land on a planet they've NEVER been to  and enter an alien structure they know NOTHING about only for one, supposedly educated ""scientist"" to say, ""Hey, my electronic analyzer said the air is breathable out here."" SO HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF!  Unbelievable. About 2 hours and 100 WTF's later, the main character (minor spoiler) givers herself an automated C-section, then...PROCEEDS TO RUN AROUND LIKE RAMBO KICKING ALIEN ASS LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.  In the real world, she wouldn't be able to stand up straight let alone sprint around and kill aliens.

When I heard that the writer from TV's LOST wrote this script, the condition of the movie made sense.  I tried to watch that series when it originally aired but found the pacing glacial at best.  It would take an entire 45 minutes of programming (minus commercials) to reveal one teeny tiny bit of information that may or may NOT be relevant to the barely-there plot...but you'll have to tune in next week folks to find out if that's so.  Ugh.  This movie FELT like it was written by a TV guy who wrote a LONG-winded series that disappointed most of its viewers after four years of loyalty for NO payoff and a WTF tacked on ending with tons of loose ends.  That's the feeling Prometheus gives you.

After that, I'd say I enjoyed Prometheus even a bit better than the 3rd & 4th Alien movies.  It was cool to finally witness how the xenomorphs inevitably came to be...and I must say that this movie was pretty intense, as it should be!

I have never honestly read the book, so I don't pretend to know how close the movie actually comes to it in comparison, but I've never been a big reader anyway...there are books I do like and will read, but my taste in sci-fi literature is pretty limited.  However, I love sci-fi movies!

All of the actors in this movie did a great job I felt.  I had only ever previously seen Noomi Rapace in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows, in which I felt she did very good, so I had no doubt she'd be good in this movie.  Then there is, of course, the ever awesome Michael Fassbender...I have liked him as an actor ever since Centurion, though his best role in my opinion so far has been the younger Magneto in X-Men First Class.  There was also the always cool Idris Elba and Charlize Theron.

I saw this movie at the dollar theater, long after it made its run.

The core of the plot was good, but it was degraded by irrelevant, moronic, scenes and dialogue that could only appeal to retards.

It starts with an alien ""engineer"" drinking some fluid which tears his body apart. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE!

A married couple find paintings and sculptures of six plain circles and immediately conclude, first, that it's a star map, then, no, wait, it's an invitation from space aliens, AND those aliens created human beings.

Riiiiight.

Most of the crew that go on this trillion dollar expedition must be the dregs of humanity, one of which comes across an obviously threatening snake-like alien organism and insists on petting it at which point it kills him and his obnoxious companion, a geologist with tattoos and a mohawk.

The whole expedition has been financed by a dying tycoon who has bought the alien-created-humans idea (and he's a brilliant businessman??), and wants to ask them the meaning of life, yet hides from the crew until the end. Why? No reason!

Then there is the metrosexual android which decides to contaminate one of the von Daniken graduates with alien blood. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE!

Then his wife gets ""pregnant"" with an organism a la film Alien. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE! She then takes part in a marathon, a couple of hours after abdominal surgery.

Riiiiiight.

Then you have the two survivors outrunning a crashing ship. In particular, they are trying to outrun the longitudinal part of the ship. Do they get out of the way, sideways? Noooooo, they run lengthwise.

Riiiiiight.

Then you have a reprise of Alien (again) by having a dangerous organism inside the lifeboat, and having the original Alien creature emerge from the dead humanoid, alien ""engineer.""",1345507200,10,1892,4.802469135802469

4797146,1,B005LAIHY0,"I think the movie's near-hysterical marketing campaign did it in more than any number of flaws and acting problems in the movie itself.  Being billed as somehow the next generation of movie-making, an epic so incredible and so beyond the medium of cinema itself, with a plot supposedly so spellbinding and powerful that it has to be kept secret until the screenings.

And I can safely say there was almost nothing original, colossal, or paradigm-shifting in this entire movie.

The plot is basically the next step to the Ancient Alien craze brought on by the crazies on ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel (IF ALIENS DIDN'T EXiST, HOW DID THEY BUILD EVERYTHING?!  I DON'T KNOW, THEREFORE ALIENS), by having someone rich and stupid enough front a trillion dollars for a deep space vessel to follow up on what they think to be a starmap in the form of pictographic carvings found all over the earth from far-flung, disconnected civilizations all portraying the same set of circles in the sky.

Leaving side the obvious conjecture that maybe they all saw the same cosmic event or series of meteors rather than assuming it's somehow alien-related, the fact that this starmap leads where it does makes it a gaping plot hole, considering that the location the go to is one where the aliens clearly would never want us to ever find if we did manage to reach the technological level to find it and go to it.  Add to that the fact that it's a trillion dollar mission that could have ended up leading to nowhere if my hypothesis that it wasn't aliens was correct.

There are no real ""characters"" to this story; they're little more than cardboard cut-outs with their personalities etched in their faces and speech.  Archetypes largely consisting of people with no discernable purpose beyond dying and being ""sciencey"".  Their only role in this movie is as ""Meat 1"", ""Meat 2"" and so on.

Considering this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION trying to find THE FIRST ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH, much less ALIENS WHO CREATED US, this is facepalmingly stupid the cast of cretins they've gathered up for this mission.  I literally thought the random punk guy was some random mercenary hired on for protection, so I was genuinely shocked when they started relying on him being ""sciencey"" later on in the movie.  The rest of them are stupid enough to make people with even the most basic knowledge of archaeology and biology shake their heads.

Considering once again that this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION bent on finding LIVING ALIENS, I honestly thought it was either an inside joke or a jab at the people when they walk into an ancient cavern on the alien planet, unopened in 2000 years, and start TOUCHING everything, stepping everywhere, and SITTING on the artifacts.  There's a reason archaeologists use those tiny little brushes to dust off found artifacts; THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND DOCUMENT A SITE; THEY DON'T JUMP INTO A PIT OF BONES AND START KICKING SKULLS AROUND.

They also see fit to take off their helmets, just because the air is breathable.  Nevermind the fact that people are strongly urged to immunize just to visit another country for fear of contracting some unknown disease, these people are on a WHOLE OTHER PLANET UNTOUCHED BY HUMANS OR ANY LIFE FORM FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS.  The TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION could've ended then and there with all of them dying of space-smallpox, and all due to their own stupidity.

Pretty much from the moment of their arrival, the movie plays out less as THE STORY OF OUR BEGINNING and more like a typical horror movie.  I had constant instances of deja vu with this movie reminding me of scenes from ""Alien vs Predator"".  Even the characters had exactly the same tones and reactions as those in AVP.

Michael Fassbender is a great actor, but his performance here is terribly uneven, though it seems more to me symptomatic of bad writing than any fault of his own.  His entire opening sequence of him watching Lawrence of Arabia, combing his hair like Peter O'Toole, riding his bike while shooting perfect hoops in basketball, and just walking around maintaining the ship play him up as a bright-eyed innocent, an android fully aware of what he is and giddy to learn more about the world and himself.  Then at random instances, he becomes sarcastic, dry, seemingly malevolent, even snotty, enough to arouse suspicion in a child, much less supposed scientists on a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION.  He then pulls a temporary heel turn with a little ""science"" experiment that would be considered crude and reckless by Medieval standards of medicine---people DID practice quarantine back then.

I say temporary because as the film progresses some more, this action of his not only proves to be pointless, but is subsequently dropped and ignored for the rest of the film.

Then comes the whole moral of the story... I see a lot of positive reviews mentioning that it's okay that the story ""doesn't explain"" everything, or that it's not the film at fault if you ""don't get it"".

Well I got it.  What I got was grade-school navel gazing hiding its own childishness behind a slick veneer of cool and hip to dismiss any criticism as ""You just didn't get it"".

As much as I trash on ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel, I find the idea of paleolithic contact to be utterly thrilling, only waiting for even the slimmest shred of evidence to justify giving it further exploration.  This movie began with something like that, and close to the end, completely dropped the existential navel-gazing unaddressed to turn to the philosophical quandry of a bawling child wondering ""Why is daddy hurting me?""

From there, another gaping plothole emerges; the aliens are suddenly hostile towards us, and the humans can't understand why.  They then proceed to make up reasons that completely ignore the facts; we're BAAAAAD people!  We burn fossil fuels!  We don't recycle!  We kill each other!  We eat animals!  We invent big shooty guns and bombs!  We touch ourselves at night!

It never gets that specific, but the ""Why me?"" wailing gets tired, fast, and suddenly I realized I don't care what the aliens wanted.  If they have a problem with us and are unwilling to negotiate, we can just kill them all.  They DID leave their planet full of a self-replicating biological superweapon ABANDONED for two thousand years, and then left us with the starmaps all over our planet!

The ending is typical, and would seemingly open the door for sequels, though of the sort that would be close to nothing like this movie, and thoroughly unwanted or uncared about.  Considering they had devised this great plan for the human race, it seems downright nutty of the scientist to STILL want to meet with them and ask them ""Why me?""

As for visuals, I suppose they were impressive.  I wasn't impressed with them; CGI is cheap, fast, and easy these days.  A dozen movies are churned out with better and better visuals and plots and characters just as bad every year.  Boasting the greatest special effects with no substance to justify them will only make the movie look quaint and silly in 5-10 years when something better is done.

I found a slight comparison with this film and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and realized it was literally the exact same basic plot:  Man finds evidence of ancient aliens, invests in a deep space mission to seek out the aliens based on their map, stuff happens, only one survivor and their pet robot.

What separates this from ""2001"" is that ""2001"" told a story that needed no words; it was the story of us, open to all manner of interpretation, with scientists actually behaving like SCIENTISTS---Poole and Bowman kept their calm when they suspected HAL of lying to them, they casually gathered inside a space pod to discuss it, they didn't freak out and start cursing at each other or playing childish games of pretend with a damn SUPERCOMPUTER thinking they could outsmart a machine designed to read people like a pamphlet.

In ""Prometheus"", they don't let you think, at least not the way you're expected to.  You're not left thinking about our beginnings, or the ancient alien concept, so much as wondering the same dumb question of ""Why us?"".  In fact, when we saw the movie, the only thing we kept wondering about is exactly what the alien at the prologue did and whether he knew what was happening.  I don't think that is what the filmmakers wanted.",1345420800,15,8392,4.786953504510756

On anyone else with a gorgeous figure like hers, the cat-suit would have enhanced the feminine side - on her, it just smoothed over those human little bumps and folds, giving an inhuman impression of plastic perfection.

What's not: Pretty much everything else. The space-suit helmets reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outland/dp/B0019BI1DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outland</a>&nbsp;- the lights pointed inward, conveniently illuminating the characters' faces, but blinding them in the process. Utter lack of quarantine against alien biota worked well for the plot but badly for common sense. The android's bio-sabotage of a fellow crewman came across without feeling - not even malice or greed, just one more chore to get done. And, although enjoyable in itself, Noomi Rapace's underwear scene just couldn't compare to Sigourney Weaver's back in the original Alien.

If you haven't seen the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;movies, and Weaver's ""Ripley"" character in particular, this comes across as a perfectly adequate SF/monster flick, maybe a cut above in its production values. Alien is iconic, though. Prometheus gives it nothing to fear in its position at the head of modern scary-monster movies.

4797150,4,B005LAIHY0,"Caught this at the late showing and was glad I did.  There are a few things I had issues with, but overall an entertaining film that is better by quite a bit compared to Aliens 3 and 4, though not as good as II or the masterpiece first film.

The plotline is posted in wikipedia if you want to know what happens, but basically they find evidence of alien life through archeological digs in ~2080.  They convince a really old guy to build a starship to go to this world and find it.

The biggest issue I had with the film was similar to what I had with no. 2.  The crew of the ship is a bunch of misfits.  This old guy spends 1 trillion bucks to put this thing together, and he gets a bunch of hard drinking, mohawk wearing wackos to be his crew.  Similar to the marines in no. 2 - as if they found the flunkies from basic training instead of elite professionals to be the choice team to send on some multi-gazillion dollar mission.

They get on the planet.. take off their helmets, and black goo from X files starts leaking all over the floor.  Gee... whats that?  Dead alien bodies everywhere... hmmmm... the air SMELLS good...

Yadda yadda people die and turn into genetically modified monsters.. more people die and things start exploding.

They also have the philosophical undertones of why are we here?  What is our purpose?  But at the end of the film it didn't seem to matter all that much.  The focal point was scary aliens and black goo and people splatting all over the screen.

And thats why I give it four stars.  There are some good scenes with the engineers (the humanoid aliens) and the black goo.  The lead is pretty good and some of the rest of the characters (especially david - very well done by Fesbender) do a good job.  And overall when I walked out of the theater I was glad I saw it.  I may even buy it when it comes out.  Not 5 stars, but definitely better than most of the John Carterish trash that comes out during the summer.",1345248000,6,1953,4.267029972752043

Of course I love ""Alien"", Aliens"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but ""Prometheus"" in my opinion joins these classics. I saw this film in IMAX 3D with my Film Club friends from my school and it was just jaw-dropping. The Directing by Ridley Scott is just amazing! He returns to sci-fi like ""Blade Runner"" was yesterday. He has an eye to amaze audiences with breathtaking visuals. The acting is Oscar worthy. Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Idris Elba give their best performances in this film. (Though most of you will dressage with this, but...) The script is great too. It has a great sense of mystery and wonder. It's not flawless, but it's still one of the more smarter scripts I've seen this  year. The 3D is 100x better then ""Avatar"".

4797314,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's movie Alien, on the surface, pitted a space crew against an alien creature. The subtext of that movie was the pitting of Creationism against Darwinism. The existence of another intelligent life form lays seeds of doubt as to our Divine Creation. Darwin's natural selection, which he later described as survival of the fittest, has been elevated from the global stage to that of the universe. Scott suggests with the Alien creature that we may not be Divinely Created, and that we may not be the fittest either. The Alien creature is the epitome of Darwinism. It has evolved to adapt to any environment.
In Prometheus Scott has once again challenged Divine Creation and added a new wrinkle to who may be the fittest. Prometheus posits that not only are we not Divinely Created but that we were created by a higher humanoid species. The fact that the ""Engineers"", as they call them, have tried to harnass and may have created the Alien puts them in the position of the fittest. This is where the movie fails for many of the negative reviewers. Some are disturbed by the notion that not only were we not Divinely Created, but that we may be nothing more than a science experiment. For others, the fact that this is not more clearly stated in the film, it's vagueness, is what brings it down.
In Alien the action, suspense and horror were in the forefront, with the notions of Creationism and Darwinism lurking in the shadows. In Prometheus the notions of Creationism and Darwinism have been brought out, not far enough for some, and the action and horror are given more of a backseat.
So Prometheus is not an action film. Instead of answering our questions about the Alien series, it raises even more questions.",1345161600,12,1723,4.7275747508305646
4797315,4,B005LAIHY0,":::::::::::Warning, all manner of spoilers ahead, ending revealed::::::::::::::

Prometheus, who was killed by the gods for giving humans fire is the name of the ship and a reference to the aliens called Engineers, or at least to one of them. The opening is a DNA blowing CGI fest wherein a 10-ft-tall Engineer abandoned on a desolate and lifeless earth drinks a black genetic goo and is ripped apart at the molecular level scattering it's DNA about the waters of our planet.

Cut ahead several thousand years cave paintings thousands of miles and years apart all depict the same 10ft engineer pointing to the same star cluster. Does it seem like weak science, yes! But that's the point, in fact they admit as much in the film. They go on the journey on the whim of a dying old trillionaire out to meet his maker and maybe cheat death. He's got nothing else to loose and he's using his own daughter and an android to lead the mission. So you can't take this as a ""week-science"" issue, because it's a leap of human faith to make the journey and the whim of a dying recluse with endless funds.

There destination is moon in the same solar system as the Planet in Alien. There they discover vast numbers of dead Engineers (including at least one with a chest-burst!)and a mysterious life sign that keeps moving and disappearing (and is actually never found or explained - cue sequel)There's also a room of canisters vaguely resembling the Alien egg room but it's a visual only, these aren't eggs. There's more of the black-goo in them, and in that is tiny worms that have grown in it, these become the prototype of the famous face-hugger model.

Part of the interest, and some of the complaints for this film start here. The worm doesn't just cause an alien to form, for example, but instead mutates and drives the infected insane. The ""alien"" is actually a more complicated creation, the ""goo"" is unwittingly ingested and the infected couples and impregnates our female scientist, she in-turns ""gives birth"" (through the most emergency c-section on film)and that ""face hugger"" will later attach to an Engineer and something similar to the ""Alien"" of the classic films is the result, and the end.

Basically it seems many were expecting the goo to simply interact and cause the first ""alien"" but that's not the case, the film won't be that simplistic, the ""alien"" isn't even the purpose of the film, it's a side chapter.

Turns out there is at least one living, but ""sleeping"" engineer, they wake him and learn more secrets, he attacks and tries to take a ship full of the deadly goo to Earth, there's sacrifice and he is stopped. However, there are more ships, many more and that strange life-sign knocking around as well as the proto-typical Alien at the last second of film. The one ""survivor"" goes off in search of the Engineers home world and we see several sequel opportunities including a more flat out Alien prequel (that would be a great idea, really, two sequels, one tracking the journey to the Engineers home the other filling in the gaps between this and Alien.) It would be especially unnerving to find out there was another crew lost before the Nostromo and that Waylend Industries sent them to the Alien ship knowing full well they'd all likely die (obviously they knew something, hence the issues with the android.)

As far as ""doesn't explain"" well, Prometheus tells a story, and in that story the Characters never find all the answers, so, neither do we. And that's okay. It tells a complete tale, you could argue that cutting 15 - 20 minutes would take away the questions so people would stop complaining about not having answers but that would degrade the film.

This is an awesome, I felt too short (if it's epic, make it 3hrs, the material was there!!!) film, it's not mindless action, it's not neat and tidy, it's more Shakespeare than Micheal Bay. So with that in mind, see it.",1344988800,9,3899,4.690058479532164
4797316,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus was a lot smaller than I expected this is because the plot takes place on the space station and the alien planet which sets the scene for a trite stereotypical science fiction movie. Prometheus is clearly not the typical high standard artistic Ridley Scott masterpiece that one would expect. The acting was pretentious and forced throughout the movie which was the most obvious disappointment. The actor who played the Captain (Idris Elba) was notably the worst actor: he appeared to have hated working on the movie the most. For instance when a harsh windstorm tears down the team he just sits there mumbling to himself and not truly caring as he watches the team get blasted on a high-tech spaceship monitor. Furthermore, it seemed as if the actors hated working on the set with each other and with Ridley Scott.

The script was average but great actors could have redeemed that flaw. The movie progressed very slowly as the languid main actress Noomi Rapace(the scientist/doctor) discovers what look like cave drawings and cryptic writings. She determined without proof that whoever wrote that also engineered humans. A sub-plot includes Dr. Weyland who expects to find a cure for old age on the mysterious planet. Dr. Weyland is in for a shock when the blue humanoid man who is found hibernating inside the planet reacts with hostility.

As the movie slowly progressed it seemed to me that Ridley Scott borrowed many ideas from Star Trek: The Next Generation rather than working with previous ideas from the Alien series. There are also no hints of Blade Runner elements in Prometheus. Rather than innovating and making a progressive science fiction movie this is more of a return to the Star Trek era which is unoriginal to say the least.

What saves this movie from being a complete disappointment is that it gets more intriguing, foreboding, ominous, and eerie as it progressed. The level of gore and violence was stereotypical for any modern science fiction movie made after the 1990's era; causing me to disagree with those reviewers who stated that Prometheus was more of a horror movie. Prometheus is not a horror movie although there is a bizarre and terrifying scene where Noomi Rapace must have an automated mechanical c section in order to remove an Alien squid. The baby squid Alien looked both ridiculous and eerie which didn't add any sparkle to the already odd movie. The other mildly horrific moments were quick, to the point, and odd: that included a giant alien squid attack on a blue humanoid that was originally hibernating from within the planet; and at the end of the movie the blue humanoid grotesquely gives birth to what looks like The Alien from the first Alien movie.

In addition to that there are a few long drawn out scenes where the team explores the planet; several frightening windstorms; a random creature attack which breaks one of the team member's arms; a random zombie attack; and an enormous spaceship literally crashed on and crushed Charlize Theron's annoying character.

Unfortunately, the production design and set design are average. There is nothing unique or notable about that. The creatures, and special effects looked out-dated by at least 6 years. I believe H.R. Giger did not work on this movie which was a shame.

Overall, this movie was very intriguing starting in the middle part and I was not bored. However, Prometheus seemed rushed, forced, pretentious, and ultimately like a Star Trek: The Next Generation movie. Noomi Repace's underwhelming performance was a disappointment considering how Alien fans are accustomed to the power and strength of the Ripley female character. Charlize Theron's character was catty, antagonistic, and selfish: nothing interesting there. At one point the ship's captain asks if she is a robot. Michael Fassbender performed well as the creepy narcissistic android but wasn't anything very special. The team that explores the planet is dull and doesn't add anything to the movie. The movie itself was filmed well: the cinematography shots throughout the movie were interesting but nothing that lived up to the original Alien movie or Blade Runner.

As of now I give this move a C+. I recommend you watch it if you like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek (the movie remake).",1344902400,4,4284,4.991596638655462

Alien Resurrection was an okay film that at least made sense.

Prometheus makes absolutely no sense. The scrip is simply TERRIBLE. The story breaks Alien lore completely. The characters are boring, clueless, morons. Just incredibly bad.

This is nothing more than a made for TV ""Alien"" spin-off, cash-cow. It is simply the worst Alien movie ever made, and possible one of THE worst movies of all time. It is a tragedy this movie exists, and is a totally wasted opportunity.

The question over whether or not this is actually a prequel to Alien (as was originally intended) has been thoroughly exhausted at this point and ultimately irrelevant. You need not have seen any other film to appreciate, admire, and enjoy Scott's latest sci-fi venture. Prometheus takes place in the same universe and references Scott's earlier film, but it really does function as a stand-alone film. With a budget somewhere between $120 and $130 million, there is little to separate Prometheus from a typical summer blockbuster. What ultimately does separate it is Ridley Scott, a man gifted in making big films with big ideas. There is enough action and visual effects to please the average moviegoer, but Prometheus is backed by an intelligent script that asks a lot of questions, answers few of them, and gives us something to ponder instead of just mindlessly blowing things up. Take that, Michael Bay.

The hypnotic opening sequence (shot in Iceland) shows a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall, drinking a mysterious liquid that induces vomiting and rapid decay. This scene is ambiguous in that it gives us no information about where he is, what he is, and or what the implications of this moment are. It intrigues us for a moment, before the film jump cuts to the year 2089. Here, archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) has discovered a star map among wall paintings from several unrelated cultures that she views as an invitation from the Engineers that may have created human life. Funded by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, Shaw and a crew embark on a voyage to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the vessel Prometheus. Travelling in stasis and monitored by the android David (Michael Fassbender), they arrive in 2093 and embark on their mission to find their creators.

Despite taking place in the same universe as Alien, the world created by the extravagant sets in Prometheus evoke a world all its own. The sets are intricately designed, large-scale creations; early contenders for the best set design Academy Award next year. Scott masterfully blends large sets, special effects, and good location scouting to create an atmospheric new world. If Prometheus offered nothing else by way of quality, it's an amazing film to look at.

It recalls Alien most noticeably in that both have a strong female protagonist and both emphasize patient, slow-burning suspense, atmosphere, and an intelligent script that equally balances a complex narrative with beautifully integrated special effects. Prometheus does not jump directly in to the action. You'll be intrigued before you'll be amazed. In a genre that frequently allows acting prowess to take a backseat to hyperkinetic imagery, you'll find some fine performances here too.

Fassbender, always the fascinating actor, wonderfully captures the ambiguous emotions of his android character. His performance is sophisticated, robotic, and yet layered with depth. It's as if HAL-9000 had assumed the look of T.S. Lawrence and was allowed to freely wander the ship. It's a performance that hurtles him ever-closer to the A-list. Rapace makes a strong, sensitive substitute for Sigourney Weaver and Charlize Theron sternly embodies a character that metaphorically holds the entire narrative subtext together.

Prometheus is imperfect, but these flaws are few and far between. Sure, fanboys may find fault with how it works chronologically with Alien (despite the fact that it's not a prequel officially), but my issues come from two much different aspects. One is Guy Pearce's makeup. When compared to the seamless visual effects, his makeup seems unconvincing and overdone. Granted, I didn't initially recognize Pearce, but I also didn't believe that Peter Weyland was an elderly man. Another issue comes from something I've already praised; the script. As intelligent and thought-provoking as it is, it doesn't offer anything new by way of story structure. It follows the template seen in Alien and more recently in Sunshine (as well as, I assume, several movies in-between). It just follows too many cues that the seasoned moviegoer will recognize right away (establish reason for mission, upon arrival there's a change in the mission, the characters begin exploring, ominous things happen, characters get scared and die unbeknownst to the others, etc.). Sure, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have fashioned something spectacular, but it wouldn't hurt to break from the template and create something wholly new.

Minor issues aside, it's terrific summer entertainment and a roaring return for Ridley Scott to the genre in which he made his name. Prometheus is a terrific film and one of the better high-minded science-fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in several years. It has suspense, horror, intelligence, drama, and depth typically eschewed in favor of a special effects extravaganza during Hollywood blockbuster season.",1344729600,9,5222,5.440740740740741
4797502,2,B005LAIHY0,"How I wanted to like this

It was full of promise when Ridley Scott decided to do a prequel to Alien. For me there are 2 Alien movies, Alien and Aliens. The others I don't bother with and of the first two I really like the directors commentary on the first.

So when Scott announced he would be making this I was delighted. Then came promising trailers and viral trailers like Guy Pearce in the Peter Wayland TED viral or Fassbender in the David 8 trailer are terrific (both can be found on youtube). So it looked very good.

It isn't very good. It isn't even good. It is a mess.

The film starts o.k. but very quickly goes past the point of reasonable disbelief. Lets enter orbit of a planet in the hope of finding a landing place (rather than find one from orbit) and this group of scientist act about as rationally as a group of highschool kids if you set them on a space voyage for spring break. Regularily something new is thrown in to keep tension in the film without ever resolving what had happened previously. And this goes on and on until it is a mess. Even the characters became one dimensional wrecks. Although an abdominal cesarean of a large alien didn't prevent them from running around with a few staples. Well admittedly Noomi Rapace does cry after the operation but then again she cries a lot - so much for Scott's strong female lead.

Of course if you set out with the promise of finding ""the answer to life the universe and everything"" - you will fail to deliver since Ridley simply can't.

By the end I was more excited to see the movie finish rather than wait for another new twist and I was hugely disappointed. they had the budget, they had the actors and they had Scott so whiskey tango foxtrot went wrong?

I had to look it up on IMdB and there it was crystal clear. Damon Lindelof is what is wrong. If you don't know who he is then he wrote Lost, a series that lived up to its title. And it all falls into place. Prometheus is no more a prequel to Alien than it is 42 episodes of Lost squeezed into a feature film. Constantly being bombarded with new events without resovling a thing = LOST. Characters behaving unbelievably unrationally and ever more so = LOST.

So this prequel falls into place with Aliens3 and Alien: Resurrection and is in fact probaly worse than those two bad as they were.",1344556800,14,2322,4.358796296296297
4797503,5,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus has landed.""  You've all no doubt seen the bombardment of television advertisements ranging from ESPN collaborations with the NBA Finals to Coors Light ads featuring the impressive ship landing on an alien surface.  Ridley Scott defined the science fiction horror genre when he gave us an absolute perfect film in 1979: ""Alien.""  There is nothing I can fault with this film.  It's the perfect blend of science and horror.  It uses suspense rather than gore.  It rarely shows us the creature lurking aboard the ship, yet we feel like we've been forced to stare at it's disturbing makeup for hours.  In fact, the alien (or ""xenomorph"") is only seen on screen for a total of 4 minutes.  In a two plus hour film.  You'd swear he was staring you in the face the entire time.  So, when Scott announced two years ago that he would be revisiting the universe he helped redefine, I was ecstatic.  I followed the film when it was known simply as ""Alien 5,"" then ""The Untitled Ridley Scott Alien Project,"" the ""Alien Paradise,"" and eventually, ""Prometheus.""  It was penned to be a prequel to ""Alien"" wherein we'd get the story of how the xenomorphs came to be, who that big guy in the pilot seat of the alien space ship was, and then a beautiful segue into the opening sequence of the original film.  But then it changed.  Scott decided to widen the scope and take the story much further than we ever imagined.

An ""Alien"" prequel, this is not.

Those of you expecting to see the iconic creature roaming around the ship and picking off crew members one by one, will be sorely disappointed.  Those of you who are open to seeing something wholly original, with some very creative DNA strands connecting it to the ""Alien"" universe, will be incredibly impressed.

The connections are few, but they are big, in my opinion.  You have Weyland Industries playing a major role, which it did in the original film, you've got androids, you've got LV-223, a moon in the same solar system as LV-426, the planet on which the original takes place, you've got the ""Space Jockey's,"" (or the big, fossilized creature in the pilot seat of the original film) and yes, of course, you've got a host of strange, bizarre, and disgusting creatures that are recognizable, yet unique, to this universe.

The film's major drawback, for me, would be that it asks too many questions, gives us a half-ass answer to some of them, and then forgets about the rest.  However, since Scott has publicly stated the film is to be a new trilogy, it does make sense that we'd have to learn more from sequels to come.  This is just part one of the prequel to ""Alien.""  This is part one of three, that will eventually lead us to the opening sequence of the original film.  But we're still a hundred years away from that universe in ""Prometheus.""  The xenomorphs haven't even been created yet.  And yes, I said created.  It's hard to discuss this film without giving away major spoilers, so I won't say anymore about that.  But the creatures you do encounter are equally as strange, dangerous, and one of them (when we see it in great detail) is one of the most disgusting and revolting things to look at on screen that I've ever seen.

The performances are, for the most part, very good.  Idris Elba as the captain of the ship is brilliant, Noomi Repace is very good as the naive young scientist who is trying to balance her faith in God with her work in science, Charlize Theron plays the ice-cold bitch perfectly, but it's Michael Fassebender's performance as the quasi-evil android, ""David,"" that steals the show.  It's nothing short of Oscar worthy, in my opinion.  His walk is reminiscent of Olympic swimmer Greg Luganis' and he parts his hair and models his dialect after Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  He is amazing to watch on screen.

What really shines in the film, though, is the incredible visuals.  It is a pure eye-gasm for two hours with the special effects.  For the first time, the computer generated creatures look and feel like they have real weight and substance to them.  It's hard to tell if they are animatronic or computer rendered.  Every detail (down to peeling placental tissues on a ""squid baby"") is in place and makes you feel like you're there.  And the 3D is mesmerizing and the best use I've ever seen, even trumping ""The Avengers.""  The sound is deafening and it all comes together for a true masterpiece of artistic genius.

As for the ""squid baby.""  Yeah, I'm not going to say anything else, other than the scene will surely go down as one of the great horror moments in the history of film, and that it easily rivals the shock of the original ""chest burster scene"" from ""Alien,"" when poor John Heard starts...choking.  This will be a scene talked about for years to come, I know it.

In closing, ""Prometheus"" is a genius piece of science fiction art.  It's for the hardcore sci-fi fans, not for the folks who just want to see a horror movie with slimy monsters roaming around.  It's got incredible substance, it's got the most beautiful opening sequence to a film I can think of, and it's got top notch special effects that are unmatched, in my opinion, to date.  And even amongst all of the great acting, deep story telling, thought provoking ideologies and gorgeous set pieces, we still get a couple of nasty little creatures to help us get that ""Alien"" vibe.  And the last thirty seconds of the film REALLY give the fanboys what we were after.

As others have said it reeks of test audience re-writes.  Thus a film by committee.  Disgusting.  The picture is beautiful - what do you expect from the best SFX houses and $130 M?  The film as a whole is an abject failure of junk science and silly plot lines.  More suitable for a teens in the woods Z grade horror flick.  I am giving it a charitable 3, but it really deserves a negative, imaginary number.  Shame Ridley, shame.",1344297600,5,746,4.075862068965518

4797506,5,B005LAIHY0,"I consider of myself a fan of Ripley and her xenomorph related antics, and this is fast becoming one my favorites. Don't get me wrong, I can understand why some people take issue with the open-ended-not-very-explicit-or-detailed writing style. In addition, there are a few scientific inaccuracies/ambiguities that might be distracting for some (although seeing how we never received much of an explanation as to how an organism can bleed molecular acid, or survive getting harpooned through the chest, or hibernate long enough for a ""Gigantic Dead Body"" to fossilize, or grow several times it's size without eating anything, or survive getting drowned in molten lead, I'm willing to let a few things slide in the film)

This is definitely one of those films that just clicks with some and not with others. Simple as that. No, liking this film doesn't make you an idiot anymore than disliking it makes you an unfair nitpick with no life. It's basically a presentation of a few interesting events coupled with amazing visuals and a great score, so a lot is left to the viewer to pick apart and decide. I will say, however, that this is definitely a movie that makes a LOT more sense the second time you see it.

Also, for you Sci-fi fans who can't stand any religious references, steer clear of this film and spare yourself (and fans of Prometheus) a big headache. I was raised in a mostly secular household with an occasional hint of neopaganism (pretty much a dogma free upbringing) so seeing a lead character who is a scientist and a person of faith does not induce a heart attack. In fact, I've met such people. So whenever some skeptic and/or new atheist blogger  whines that Dr. Shaw is a contradiction, I think to myself, ""Um, yeah. Duh. That's kind of the point.""

It also fascinates me that this film is getting pretty much the same reaction that Alien did. Perhaps only time (and maybe an extended cut) will tell us all how good this movie is or isn't, but in the meantime, I'm happy to let Davids sultry voice wash over me as I contemplate questions pertaining to creator and creation. Because there's still one REALLY important question that must be addressed, hopefully in the sequel:

Why didn't Micheal Fassbender take his shirt off?",1344211200,24,2246,4.763496143958869

I thought I was going to see a futuristic sci fi film with some amazing scenes, I was totally blown away! This is a truly modern sci fi masterpiece, visually stunning, thought provoking, terrifying...amazing.
Ridley Scott delivers, exceeds expectations, by creating a new view on an old premise that maybe we are not alone or maybe, just maybe we were deposited here by other beings. And if that is true, what can create can also destroy just as easily.
We see our own advances into the future and are inspired and amazed, then we see what may have created us and find out that they are advanced beyond our biggest dreams and we are nothing but a failed experiment. The beings may be advanced and powerful, but our passion for life, and knowledge is a threat to them and they decide to trigger our destruction because of it.",1344211200,31,1089,4.477386934673367

The movie had great acting and stunning visuals but the writing and storytelling is absolute crap. There are so many stupid elements in the story of Prometheus that in my opinion, it's not even worth owning on DVD, unless you're a special effects guru/fan of sci-fi films.  The sets and the ship are amazing, but as I've said, what ruins the film is the story; without revealing any spoilers you see dumb scientists doing dumb things, a huge disappointment of a film.",1344038400,7,590,4.556603773584905
4797509,1,B005LAIHY0,"The best compliment I can give Prometheus is that, well, there's actually 2 compliments I can give Prometheus:

1. It's very pretty looking
2. It's better than the Phantom Menace

Seriously. People keep comparing this to The Phantom Menace, and that's so unfair. It's easily better. For one it's prettier and there's some nice creepy characters. But ultimately, Prometheus is a movie so bad that I can only recommend it to people the same way I recommend The Phantom Menace: not at all.

Before people tell me I didn't get this movie or I didn't grow up in the time the Alien was released: I actually grew up with these movies in my video collection. I like Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, but Alien Ressurection disappointed me greatly. And let's not even get started on those horrid Alien Vs. Predator movies- those movies are just plain insulting to both franchises. And sadly, so is Prometheus. Oh, and I got it just perfectly. It's too bad the film is just a steaming pile of crap, though.

One thing I could imagine was that Ridley must have overheard his 5 year old grandson telling a friend a story when coming up with the idea for the film. Seriously. ""And then a robot can see people's memories, and then they go to a planet, and there's a cave with all these coccoons, and then they find a head, then they bring it back to their ship, then they revive it, then it explodes, and then the robot puts alien blood in a guy's drink, and then the woman scientist has a baby in her tummy, and then she removes it from her stomach but it's not really a baby but an alien and then the guy turns into an alien, then they go to a cave, and then they meet a bald guy, and then the robot gets his head torn off, then the woman goes back to the ship, and then the alien from her tummy didn't die there and fights the bald guy that followed her..."" seriously. As Peter Griffin says, ""There, I just saved you two long and boobless hours!""

In addition to such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender. I felt sorry for him, watching him be the one good actor in a film riddled with bad performances.

Then there's the dialogue. Dear lord. I swear for 10 minutes the dialogue consided of ""Prometheus are you seeing this? Prometheus did you catch the image I just saw? Prometheus are you still following us?"" I swear if I heard the word ""Prometheus"" one more time I was going to walk out of the cinema. And that horrid ""I am your father"" moment... UGH.

Just avoid this film at all cost. It will ruin everything you love about the Alien movies.",1344038400,14,2837,4.38212927756654

""Prometheus"" (2012)
----------------------------------------------------------
In this eerie prequel to the ""Aliens"" franchise, director Ridley Scott shows himself firmly in command, a skillful, dynamic auteur with a capacity to evoke wonder and inspire awe. Although tied to the Alien films, ""Prometheus"" is creepy and suspenseful but doesn't dwell in the high-octane gore of the original films -- it's there, but it's not the whole point of the film.  Instead, big concepts about the conquest of space, cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens, androids and man are probed and examined, and many big questions are left dangling, tantalizingly in need of further exploration. I can't remember a recent movie I've wanted a sequel of more than this one - I'm itching to see what happens next!

In addition to the direction and special effects, the acting is also pretty good. I did not care much for the pair of lead actors Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green (the scientists behind the expedition) although Charlize Theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder, and Idris Alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain (with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew...) The breakaway star of this show, though, is the steely-eyed Michael Fassbender, who plays David, the film's obligatory android, who is a spine-tingling combination of 2001's HAL and Star Trek's Data, one of the best portrayals of an AI being you'll ever see. Truly delicious. The aliens look cool, too.

Bravo for Ridley Scott, who is back in the saddle again... Hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels... Can't wait until they're out! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1343952000,17,1780,5.35

However, this movie was a huge disappointment for me. Usually I like movies that keep me thinking long after I've watched them, but this wasn't one of those GOOD thought provoking movies. This movie just leaves the audience confused. I admired the direction that the movie was striving for (where do we come from, who made us, etc.), but this garbage only answers those questions with more questions. It's almost like Scott was watching ""Ancient Aliens"" on the History Channel (which I do enjoy by the way) and decided to make a movie based on that premise. Furthermore, I thought the creature design was terrible in this movie! Oh! Look! A giant squid! What is this?! 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?!! I feel like Scott has gone the way of Spielberg and Lucas and began mining his old classics, only to replace them with new Sh! t.

A team of scientists arrive on an alien planet to uncover the origins of humans and the earth, but what awaits them is something deadly.

Is it any good?

Prequels have been the flavour of the last decade as an easy way to extend the life cycle of a particular franchise. Some of them decent, but mostly bad. So, leave it to Sir Ridley Scott to create a smart science fiction film that sets the film in the `Alien' world, but doesn't rely on it as a cheap way to market the film. Naoomi Rappose (from Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is a breath of fresh air, with her excellent performance as the crew leader Shaw, but it is David the robot, (played by Michael Fassberer) which deliveres the performance that most people will be talking about. Simply amazing. For me, what makes this film so great is the perfect balance between the amazing action and exploration, allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in the world. The controversy surrounding the film in regards to being 'confusing' is quite ridiculous, so if you do get the chance, make sure to see the film in IMAX 3D for an out-of-this world experience.

Best bit?

Giving birth to a human child is the most wonderful and joyous occasions that could happen. An alien child? Not so much. A horrifically cringe worthy scene to say the least.

4797588,1,B005LAIHY0,"If you're teetering with the decision to buy Prometheus then ask yourself one blatantly obvious question: Why is it there are SO many reviewers saying people walked out on this film and yet others are claiming it was brilliant? It makes you wonder who the positive reviewers are; maybe they've got a stake in the proceeds? The simple truth is Scott missed the mark...Period! Shame on YOU Scott for taking such ridiculous chances and veering so far from a plausible story we were all expecting! I've been a true fan of the franchise since seeing the original in the theaters and was SO excited about this movie; I even bought the new Blu-ray pack with hours and hours of extra footage just to catch any extra ""production secrets"" about plot and character development. Mind you, I'm not some die-hard fanatic that believes a story MUST stay within certain rigid parameters. The simple truth is sometimes less is more and trying to cram too much into Prometheus just made it a mess. There was NO depth as others are claiming, trying desperately to appear as intellectuals as though the rest of us didn't catch some brilliant thread of a concept; you'll get more inspiration to our origins watching Ancient Aliens on TV. This is the first review I've ever taken my time to write because I rely on objective reviews when purchasing from Amazon and I felt SO deprived with Prometheus, I just had to share it with other Alien fans. If you look at the trend over the past couple of years, it was one of ""beginning origin"" films. Star Trek, X-Men, Planet of the Apes all created great movies showing us HOW the characters all came about and it was fun to see them develop, especially Star Trek; however, Prometheus was an attempt to somehow beat the others not only to show how the Alien creature came about, but also to explain Man's creation as well. It was just awful; even if you aren't an Alien fan, it was not a good movie; it was long and drawn out and even the scary/suspenseful parts were weak. When I saw Prometheus, MANY people walked out on it; I even considered it several times, but I stayed HOPING something would turn it around! What a let down. All the hoopla before the release of this film tried to make Scott appear as a movie making ""God"" now it just looks ridiculous. My belief is take creative liberties on a NEW film, not a proven franchise. I HOPE Scott realizes the mistakes he made and doesn't take such chances on the next film that hopefully bridges the gap between this film and the first Alien movie.

4797789,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is a Ridley Scott masterpiece, and it is every bit as good as Alien and Blade Runner. I fail to see how and why ths film is getting such harsh reviews, at least Roger Ebert got it right. My one star review is for 20th Century Fox's Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy only.

I am a little bit of a film buff and back in the day was an avid Laserdisc collector. I had all my favorite films on Laserdisc in Widescreen and watched them often. Laserdisc at the time the best way to enjoy your favorite movies in all their glory. My player was not a very expensive one so after almost an hour or so i would have to take a short intermission and flip the disc over. This was not an issue for me at all and sometimes myself or company would see this as a perfect opportunity for a bathroom break.
When DVD first hit the market in the US i knew that the picture and sound quality was nowhere close to the quality of a Laserdisc so i decided not to purchase one. I also knew that there was a better version available in Japan at that time, the Blu-ray, that used zero compression and had a picture and sound that even surpassed that of the Laserdiscs. Many years later however the DVD's became so cheap that it became obvious to me that this was a great way to fill in the gaps in my film collection, so i not only purchased a DVD player, i started collecting DVD's as well. Then many years after that the Blu-ray's were finally made available to the US market and sold countless amounts to many people who did not even know what a Laserdisc was.

I still do not own a Blu-ray player, even though i own a copy of Guillermo Del Toro's Directors Cut of Mimic and Zack Snyder's Extended Cut of Sucker Punch on Blu-ray. Unfortunately these films and many others i am sure, were only made available in the Blu-ray format. I have not seen these films yet because i refuse to use my Sony Playstation 3 to view them. If you have spent what i've spent on a new laser and new drive for your Playstation you would not use yours to watch movies on either. Someday i will no doubt have to shell out the extra cash for a Blu-ray player because some of the films from Directors i love are only making their films available in that format.

It is amusing that there are so many reviews on Amazon for Prometheus as a film, even though when this review was written there was not even a release date for this Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy.
As a fan of Prometheus and Ridley Scott i will wait to purchase a copy in the hopes that there may be some sort of later Collectors Edition made available that delves deeply into the filmmaking process. An edition that perhaps shows how H.R. Giger's design work for an unfilmed Dune, and the hauntingly beautiful mural seen on the ceiling made it into the film. An edition that shows how the special effects were created and why everything looked so huge and real, the best special effects i have seen in any film, with the exception of 2001 a Space Odyssey.
I hope that if there is a Collectors edition made available in the future, it is not just available in Blu-ray. Although if that is the only way to purchase this great film with some great suplemental material, i will obviously be forced to get one.

I am not at all concerned about getting a 3D version of Prometheus even though it was filmed with 3D cameras. I have a beautiful 2D Collectors Edition DVD of James Cameron's Avatar, and even though this film was shot using the same 3D cameras, it looks just spectacular to me in 2D. I am a fan of seeing films in the 3D format as long as they were filmed with 3D cameras, otherwise i won't waste my money. For me seeing a film in 3D at the theater is a rare treat that i do enjoy, but at home i am quite comfortable watching in 2D. As you may have guessed i do not own a Plasma or LCD TV either. A great film is a great film, even if you are only watching it in 2D, on a 57 inch Toshiba Rear Projection TV.

I for one cannot wait to see Prometheus again. When i saw it in the theater in 3D i was in awe. There were numerous moments throughout watching Prometheus that i said wow to myself. The 3D effect was used quite well and added a greater depth to the visuals, although the effect was used quite differently than say Avatar or Hugo.
For some reason when a film is converted from 3D to 2D the film still looks quite striking, as is the case with my 2D DVD version of Avatar, but when a 2D movie is converted into 3D it really looses much more than it gains.

Revised review...

I have had some interesting responces to this review, in the single most important one i was told that this Blu-ray set would have suppliments on the Blu-ray disc, and possibly the DVD would have a commentary. Therefore i have adjusted my review score to reflect the brilliant film that Ridley Scott made and a disc set that will apparently contain bonus content.

Way back when i still watched Lasediscs a good friend of mine owned a video store and was very much in the know about video technology. It would have been easy for him to upsell me on DVD's when they came out and for me to get a player, then he could rent and sell me Lasediscs and DVD's. He stated to me that there was already a technology that was being worked on that used zero compression in the audio and video. This new technology promised to provide better than Laserdisc picture and sound. It would seem by the actual invent dates that Blu-ray did not exhist until 2006, nine years after the introduction of the DVD. But the Blu-ray technology was being developed none the less. My friend told me at the time to continue to watch and enjoy my Lasediscs and just hold out until the smaller video discs were perfected. He also told me that the DVD discs used compression to store the information on the disc and that the Laserdisc did not, this is why the Laserdisc had a better picture and sound than when DVD's were first introduced. I was actually shown a side by side comparison of a Laserdisc vs DVD so i could choose for myself. What i saw was a far better picture on the Laserdisc than on the DVD, and to me the Laserdisc sounded better as well.

One of the responces i recieved mentioned that i was being silly for not using my Playstation to view Blu-ray's. After shelling out close to two hundred dollars for a new laser and drive for my old school 6 gig console, i will only use my Playstation to play games. If money were no object to me obviously i wouldn't care and i would use it to watch Blu-ray's, but then again if that was the case, i would have purchased a DVD player back in 1995-1997 when they first came out.

I still find it amusing that there are reviews for a product that does not yet exhist.",1343520000,6,6693,4.24235294117647

There is no doubt that this will end up being one of the best films of the year. This is definitely better than some of Scott's more modern movies (Gladiator, Hannibal, Robin Hood, etc.). He is a visionary of a director, and is one of the best in the business. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved ALIEN.",1343260800,12,705,4.983050847457627
4797793,5,B005LAIHY0,"It appears that many reviewers of Prometheus want to connect it with other films and then complain that too many connections were made to other films.  This reviewer suggests that you should see the film with an open mind and not excessive preconception.  First off, there are absolutely zero tacky scenes in the film.  Director and producer Ridley Scott went to great lengths to avoid rehashing of motifs that have been made trite by all the loosely related films subsequent to Aliens.  By avoiding the gratuitous nature of these films, he has made more subtle suggestions regarding the origins of themes commonly found in the Alien universe.  Additionally, the plot and story are fascinating to consider.  Subjects ranging from the origins of humanity to the relationship between a creator and the created are addressed without providing concrete answers or overwhelming the audience.  And just to note, if you want a film that does all the thinking for you, then you should ask yourself why you want to see this film to begin with.  In other words, Prometheus is not simplistic summer schwag.  Finally, this film has an unbelievably cool sense of style.  It is refreshing to know that there are still directors that can merge kinetics with creative camera angles to construct action sequences that actually contribute to the story.  It is difficult to ask for more from Prometheus than what is already delivered.",1343001600,32,1415,5.004273504273504
4797794,5,B005LAIHY0,"I attended the opening night of Prometheus at an IMAX 3D theater. The movie will undoubtedly receive Academy Award nominations in all categories. The IMAX 3D presentation was the finest use of IMAX 3D technology that I have ever experienced. The 3D was so excellent that it was literally like sitting in the middle of the action! The filmmakers know how to manipulate 3D and make it look good! I get a tingling sensation even thinking about it! That is why I pre-ordered Prometheus in the Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy version without hesitation. This will become a treasured work of timeless cinematic art in my movie collection.

Beyond the existential components of this film, Prometheus is a true prequel that fully explains the Alien Anthology (also out in Blu-ray and part of my collection). You will understand how it all began, and if you view the 2003 alternate endings for the films up to the finale, Alien Resurrection (the final movie of the Alien saga) replaced with a ""feel good ending"" in theaters, you will understand WHY that ultimate ending was inevitable. Although the Alien saga is a dark journey into the depths of hell, so to speak -- in essence an anthology of humanity's evolution through extinction and rebirth into a new quasi-human species over the course of centuries -- it is existentially worth the dark journey. How would YOU like to have acid for blood?

I found many epiphanies about this universe and our existence as its intelligent observers. Perhaps parallel universes are God's proving grounds for intelligent life to decide if they truly want the burden and anguish of becoming ""like"" God, ""knowing good and bad""? Atheists, theists and agnostics will each find a different interpretation, no doubt, because it is debatable as to the true implications of Prometheus and the Alien movies that chronologically follow.

However, theists will find solace in the unstoppable faith of Dr. Shaw. Perhaps one epiphany and take away from Prometheus is life may exist beyond this tiny blue planet -- the ancient holy texts may be allegories and not literal. Dr. Shaw believed God still exists and shall receive her beyond the great veil of reality when her temporal life ends. When her tests are over, however long that takes, God will deliver her from this great void. Atheists can pay no mind to these implications because Prometheus offers plenty of grist for the mill to argue that Shaw's faith is noble at best. That is the beauty of this film. Prometheus challenges both sides to think carefully about any preconceived fanciful illusions about God's existence as allegorically taught by the Church, or as dogmatically denied by hardcore nihilists.",1342742400,7,2690,4.973333333333334
4797795,2,B005LAIHY0,"first of all, and you will encounter this to the end of time, the script of the film is so vacant, illogical and overreaches so badly, it is nearly all holes, thinly edged with actual storyline.  alien fans, sorry, but although alien allusions are forced into the film, it is no prequel if you want it to be dedicated to a development of thnonsense it fails to develop ANY theme or characters.  that said, i feel the reasons there is such division of opinion about this thing are 4.  1.  critics have praised it all the way up the level of mediocrity, setting aside fanatical and inevitable contrarians such as bob ebert who have salaamed it to heights of quality it has nothing whatever to do with.  2.  in 3d, it really is one of the best visual displays i've seen of a film.  3.  the ""alienation"" of what plot there is has attracted masses if 15 year olds who are determined to force meaning upon them no matter how.  4.  unforgivably, scott seems to have imported the dubious damon linderllof expressly to transform what might have been a coherent script into more than two hours of obscurantist tease, only too reminiscent of his constantly and consciously ambiguous Lost.  for those of you who are familiar with blade runner, you will recall ridley's unicorn ""puzzle"" dream.  prometheus is made up almost entirely of such unicorns, except you are expected to wait for prom II for them to mean anything.  simple stupidity aside, that is one film too late for me.",1342656000,7,1467,4.596153846153846
4797796,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.

I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed ""Prometheus"" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or ""artifical person"", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.

The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say ""The Future"", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious ""red shirts"" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the ""company woman"" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.

However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.

While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.

I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.

4797797,2,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus might be the most expensive, most well-done grindhouse B-movie I've ever seen.

There's a lot to appreciate about the filmmaking at play here.  The visuals are very impressive and detailed, with effective blending of CGI and practical sets.  The performances are really strong all around and the general pacing and atmosphere and things like that are all effective and evenly laid out.  It's so technically strong that it makes the absolute insanity and inconsistencies in the script and story really, really standout.  It's not a fun movie.  It's an impressive movie, but certainly not a fun one, and I wouldn't really know who to recommend it to.  It's not good sci-fi, because there are too many plot and logic holes.  It's certainly not a horror film, though it pretends to be one every so often.  I suppose it's more of an action/thriller?

I guess the bottom line is, so long as you're not looking for anything that makes sense, you'll be okay.  It sounds weird to say that, because we all assume that we're want things to make sense, but...  I guess if you really, really liked Lost, and didn't care that it turned out to be made up on the fly, you might really get off on Prometheus.

Mostly it's a visually impressive mess; a mediocre-to-bad script with excellent performances.
And the occasional penis snake.

Let's cut this thing open, shall we?

****HEAVY SPOILERS!  SUPER HEAVY SPOILERS!  I'M SERIOUSLY!*****

Okay, so the basic plot of the movie is this: Some archeologists... or space archeologists or whatever... find various evidence that points to a planet where they believe the aliens who created human life may have come from.  Old Man Guy Pearce hears about this and funds a trillion dollar expedition to go to the planet to meet the creators because it would be awesome and because maybe they can keep him from dying from horrible old-age makeup.  Once they get there they do find their creators, but also find out that said creators seem to hate humans and had been planning on wiping us all out with a super weapon (super-gross weapon, actually) before they accidentally killed themselves with that same weapon.  It's left unclear whether all of the creators (or ""engineers"" as they call them because it sound more differenter) died out or whether they just gave up on the whole attack earth thing and our surviving protagonist hijacks an alien ship with her bodyless robot friend to try and found out.

I actually, really like that plot.  That's a neat story.  The problem comes from all the BS they layer on top of and around that story to pad it out to beyond necessary lengths.  It's such an awkward and stupid script; I'm not sure where to begin.

There's a whole subplot with the android, David (played by Magneto), starts messing around with this Black Goo they find.
 Now, there's a bit in the beginning where an alien drinks the Black Goo and melts... which is not what the Black Goo (or BG, as I call it for no reason) does later, but whatever.
So, the scientists science it a little bit and sort of off-handedly decide its some kind of weapon.  David steals a jar of it, brings it on the ship, and secretly feeds it to the head scientist... for some reason.  It's heavily implied that Old Man Pearce asked him to do this during a clandestine meeting (while Old Man Pearce is faking his death for some reason; a ruse that fools exactly zero people in the audience).  The BG winds up making the head scientist really sick, but not until the next day and not until after he's had sex with Scientist hot-pants.  So he dies and she gets pregnant with an alien monster baby that almost kills her.  Magneto tells her about it after examining her, but then says that she shouldn't have the monster surgically removed, but instead should just go be re-frozen.  Hot Pants puts herself into an auto-surgeon 9000 and the movie turns into torture porn for a bit as the rapidly growing alien squid thing gets removed from her gut, c-sections style. ...in her defense, she takes it pretty well and is running and climbing in about twenty minutes time.  Also, that squid thing just sort of hangs out in there until the end of the movie, when it's grown into a nine-foot long version of the facehugger from Alien.  Oh, also, the BG turns a different guy into a murderous zombie... somehow.  Also another guy tries to pet a hissing alien penis snake and gets (deservedly) brutally murdered for being a dumb action movie idiot.

If you bothered to read all that and you're wondering what it had to do with the plot about finding the creator aliens, the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  It's 60% of the movie and it is total, pointless filler.

Why would David feed the Goo to what's-his-name?  Did Guy Pearce ask him to, just to see what would happen?  Did he become an evil Android for a minute, just for the hell of it?  It couldn't have possibly been planned out beforehand because they didn't even know that the BG existed until David stole a bunch of it.  The whole sub-plot implies, with half conversations and significant glances, that David or Guy Pearce or possibly Charlize ""Daddy Issues"" Theron is carrying out some intricate plan... that benefits literally no one and gets a bunch of people killed.

It's a total red-herring (along with several others I don't have the energy to relive right now) that desperately tries to confuse the audience into thinking the movie is super-duper smart.

Also, how about this - near the end of the movie it's established that this is NOT the Alien's home planet, but a planet they use to make awful, awful weapons.  This is confirmed at the end when David tells Hot-pants that he can lead her to the actual home planet so she can get her answers... or, you know, die horribly, which is far more likely.  So WHY would the aliens leave, on Earth, little maps to the planet they make weapons on.  Of all the planets they (apparently) hang out at, why a map to THAT one?
I could keep going, but there's no need to beat that poor horse anymore.

Aside from the insultingly stupid script, the visuals (while well done) are just a series if images borrowed from other sources.  Alien, Star Trek, the Abyss... a slew of sci-fi designs were yoinked to make the ship, the space-suits, the planet itself - almost nothing felt truly original to me.  But, I don't know, maybe that's me reading too much into it and being hypercritical.  I'm not exactly on the movie's side at this point.

I suppose the greatest falling apart is that the film never knows what it wants to be.  It wants to be a prequel to Alien, but doesn't want to be an Alien movie.  Sometimes it's a horror movie, with creepy monsters and jump scares.  Sometimes it wants to be an action movie, with obligatory action scenes and flamethrowers and expendable guys with guns.  Sometimes it wants to be a psychological thriller about God, Religion and hating your parents.  Sometimes it's a stupid monster movie.

And never once is it Science Fiction.  Don't even bother.  Just because something is in space doesn't make it science fiction.

I don't argue that Ridley Scott is a very talented film maker, and I don't argue the movie is a lot better than a wide array of things out right now.  But if you're like me, and you like a decent story, this mess is absolutely infuriating.

But the characters in this movie had no believable motivations to do any of the stupid things they did.  It lost all believe-ability an left me disappointed.

Like cheap haunted house stories - where every time someone goes in the barn you hear screams and they die.  And yet one after one, the people keep going in the barn?

In this movie, one second we're running from alien monsters.  The next we're saying they're cute and sticking our faces down by them.  In one moment we're in an alien environment and paranoid about the unknowns.  The next, we're ditching the space helmets and breathing the air.

Not only were the visuals stunning, the plot was interesting even if it was just another take on the ancient astronaut theory and the special effects were remarkable. I was expecting another crappy, mindless alien movie with nothing but a bunch of predictable mindless beasts lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce. I think a lot of nerdy fanboys got butthurt because it didn't turn out to be just that. Aliens have been done to death, brought back as a zombie and then done to death again and then some. I find it humorous that fanboys think the Alien films were wonderful and without plot holes and inconsistencies. The same basement dwelling virgins that have posters of Bladerunner on their walls forget that that film was also ripped to shreds by their ilk when it first came out. It wasn't until the director's cut came out and a few years had passed that it became a respected sci-fi classic. Fanboys are a lazy lot, want only mindless, nonstop action and just don't want to think. They want everything spoon-fed to them on a silver platter with nothing left to the imagination. Nerd fanboys are ruining chances of more great sci-fi movies being made because producers know fanboy losers will hang out in their darkened rooms and pick the movie to shreds frame by frame so they can go online and tear it a part in a vain attempt to sound smart when it just makes them look pathetic. And when the day comes that the only movies being made are stupid rom-coms and cheesy disney flicks the butt-hurt nerds will complain to no end but they'll have no one to blame but themselves that producers won't want to make anymore sci-fi flicks. I really hope they make a sequel because the engineer universe can be expanded upon whereas the alien universe is dead. So if you're a pretentious fanboy, don't watch this film, watch the alien movies that have already been made because they're all the same and there is nothing new to add to the alien universe because aliens are just mindless beasts fought by undeveloped characters with big guns that nobody cares about.",1342051200,14,2136,4.623684210526315

This is a fine example of overeducated, overgrown children who think they're smarter than everyone else, especially the people that made this film. It's a shame, because I thought the movie was extremely well done and deserving of a sequel. Thanks to the ridiculous complaints, this probably will never happen.

4797905,5,B005LAIHY0,"I have seen this film twice, both times IMAX 3D, both times with my wife and 11-year-old son.  This is my review after seeing it the first time:

Let me say at the outset I am more of a fan of Ridley Scott's work generally than I am of Alien per se, although I have enjoyed it and all of its successors (albeit in varying degrees). But I am much more of a fan of Blade Runner than Alien, for example, and also films of his like Black Rain, Someone To Watch Over Me, Kingdom of Heaven and of course Gladiator. So it was with tremendous anticipation that I awaited this film, but NOT because it necessarily had anything whatsoever to do with Alien.

I followed every bit of the viral marketing campaign and all the tidbits in places like this (Prometheus-Movie.com), and read a lot of pro and con reviews before I got to see the film. I have to tell you that exposure to all the spoilers I encountered by doing this did not reduce my viewing experience one bit.

I brought my wife (also a big Ridley Scott fan) and my 11 year old (he is very mature for his age), who had been watching Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection on the Sci Fi channel, so he knew all about facehuggers and chestbursters. We saw it in IMAX 3D which is definitely the way to see it.

I have to say, my mind was totally blown by this film. I was absolutely riveted for the entire duration. I thought that among the key characters there was very rich but very subtle interplay that gave deep insights into their motivations and personalities. Of course, Fassbender's portrayal of David was sheer genius and may get him an Oscar.

And the visuals of the film were peerless. It looked real and I was totally lost in the experience. The pacing was great, it moved faster and faster which dragged you along for one hell of a ride. It is the ""2001"" of our time.

So many aspects of this film are still churning around in my head, but the key one that is surfacing is that this was NOT a scientific mission in the sense we think of it (the way NASA would execute it), it was a last ditch attempt of a dying man with virtually unlimited resources at his disposal to try and find something, anything, to cheat his death. There are multiple layers of story wrapped around this that will make for much pondering (and repeat viewing), but that is the core.

The people who complain that this doesn't answer all their questions about Alien or the SJs etc. are missing the point. In all cases of science, or anything for that matter, the answers you get do really lead only to more questions. The same way in Blade Runner (Director's Cut) where it ended with Deckard and Rachel leaving Deckard's apartment, reaching for a future together into the unknown, Prometheus leaves many things open for us to ponder and wonder at. That's what makes it a great piece of art, to me, as opposed to something that sewed up loose ends in a pedestrian fashion.

In time this will be viewed with the same reverence as 2001 and Blade Runner, for sure. For me, it already is.

Thanks for reading.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
This is my review after seeing it the second time:

I am typing this 39000 feet over Colorado (gotta love Virgin America). So, my wife, son and I saw Prometheus for the second time (again in IMAX 3D) and we still loved it. I noticed the 3D more this time...it is very subtle, it just adds a ""hyper real"" feel to the film until the star map, and then whoa!

I also saw a number of things I missed the first time. I had missed the fact that you could hear the Engineers talking to each other in the hologram in the control room of the Juggernaut. But mostly I missed some of the things Weyland said.

Now it seems much more clear to me. To me, the film really is about Weyland and his attempt to cheat death, and his willingness to use anyone or anything to that end. That is what drives the plot, even though that is not evident from the start.

I think with the perspective of time, people will see this as the equal of Blade Runner or even surpassing it. And what other movie in recent memory has kept you thinking about it, talking about it, arguing about it. That is what separates a work of art from just a movie.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

In closing, after thinking about it another week or so, the only thing I would add to the above is to emphasize the ""Blade Runner"" like aspects, in the study of David as a character, as a PERSON, with his motivations and, yes, emotions.  A fantastic film.  Even my wife wanted to see it a second time. All these Alien junkies are complaining because it didn't spell out in crayon all the questions raised in Alien. Guess what? IT WAS NOT A PREQUEL. I feel sorry for these folks because a great movie was right in front of their faces and they were too blinded by their expectations to even see it.  2001 left a lot of questions hanging, as did Blade Runner...as did the beloved Alien.",1341705600,18,5170,4.660439560439561

>>>>>>>>> SPOILERS AHEAD <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

A SHIP OF FOOLS
One would think that when someone is making a trillion dollar investment and, to boost, having his own immortality ride on this expedition, he would make a more careful selection of his team. Not slap together whoever happened to be waiting for the bus at the corner, right? So who did we get here?
-- A captain that is more interested in getting in the pants of the owner's dominating daughter than what enters his ship or not.
-- An archeologist (intense Rapace was a excellent fit for the role) who supposedly has faith but that seems to exhaust itself on clinging to her cross. However, I am willing to give this some leeway as it is bound to come up in the sequel(s). I am guessing sacrifice and probably I am not alone in this.
-- A geologist/gun expert that is so grossly stereotyped and has such a bad temper (no one thought of running a personality screen BEFORE launch, right?) that his (telegraphed) death is actually a relief.
-- A Biologist who is eager to abandon all notion of evolution in favor of an alien designer at the drop of a penny. And his sole contribution, when faced with an alien creature that looked like a cobra (fear of snakes is innate, mind you), was to try to...pet it, while uttering ""here, kitty-kitty-kitty!"".
Of course, said...""kitty"" eats his face off. As a Biologist myself, I felt shame - and I have to ask: of all the millions of Biologists on Earth, why did they choose this hooded hippie again?
-- The owner's daughter who decides to follow her father in order to cause his death and finally inherit him. Would it not make more sense to simply wish him farewell and stay behind on Earth? There was no way this ship of idiots would ever return!

PLANET-SIZED PLOT HOLES
Suspension of disbelief is a requirement for almost every single movie and needed in a large dosage for every science fiction one. Nevertheless, there are some thorns in my side that would not let go.
-- A spaceship that is capable of traveling between stars, entering an alien atmosphere without burning up and and being set down like a helicopter wherever managed to catch the team's eye at the last moment? No one even thought of scouting and mapping out the planet first in order to have a landing plan, right?
-- Said magic spaceship can also accelerate like a sports car in Earth-like gravity at a 45 degrees angle (in order to ram the alien ship) and the captain manages to make it do this, not in an g-suit and strapped in a harness, but standing up in his loose-hanging veteran jacket.
-- The archeologists were pursuing their discovery whereas the rest of the rag-tag team probably needed the money. But why would ultra-rich Vicker's daughter go on a mission like this? Did she have a death wish to undertake such a dangerous (and haphazardly slapped together) mission?
-- Relativity is a heartless mistress. Gliese-86 is 35 light years away. That means that even at light-speed, it would take 70 years to get there and back. Did she leave no one she cared for behind? Because almost everyone she knew will be dead by the time she gets back.
-- Okay now, what WAS the plan? Meet with these alien creators so that Vickers can become immortal? Did they have any indication that this was even remotely possible? Then how would they know about the mutating alien and have a plan to bring it back in a host in stasis?

As a fun, good-looking movie, Prometheus is a limited success.

Unfortunately Prometheus lacks the depth of Ridley Scott's best work. The characters talk about answering the most meaningful questions that mankind can pose but when it comes right down to it, Prometheus is another ""there's an alien in my body"" movie combined with an ""aliens want to destroy the Earth"" movie. Did we really need another one?  To be fair, there are some clever touches, some interesting twists, and a thoughtful ending, making this an above-average evil alien movie, but it's still just an evil alien movie.

4797908,3,B005LAIHY0,"Nope, that's not a good 'wow'. This isn't by far one of the worst movies I've seen. The movie does however garner a lot of nerd-rage from those expecting more from it. The problem with Prometheus is it's a big dumb movie masquerading as a thoughtful, intelligent film about the origins of our existence and the questions such as ""What is our place in universe?"" Personally, it makes it hard for me to give a crap about these existential questionings when I'm given cardboard characters straight out of any generic slasher film except instead of teens they're scientists who are all well out of their teens, which makes their stupid decision all the more clichd. These supposedly intelligent and experienced scientists go around making all the basic horror movie mistakes. They're all easily broken down as, the hothead, the goofy sidekick with glasses, the b*tch (who never quite lives up to her title yet the script seems to think she does), the jerk boyfriend, the nice (boring) girlfriend and the cool guy (the pilot). The only exceptions are David, the android, who clearly has emotions yet chooses (understandably so) to hide this from his shipmates and the other 10 crewmembers who have no purpose other than to be killed off. This lack of character means you have no horse in this race.
The next problem is the fact that this movie has no idea what it wants to be, a generic monster/horror film or an intelligent sci-fi delving into questions of the origin of human life and the meaning of having a soul. The hybrid of these two ideas could be brilliant, instead you have a movie here that clumsily alternates between the two ruining both aspects. Don't get me wrong, I gave it 3 stars, so there are things I enjoy about the film, such as it being very good looking plus, pretty much every scene taken individually works, there are so many good moments in this film but once you put it together as a whole, it's structure with no real foundation therefore it collapses into a heap of pretty looking rubble. It's hard to really get into the problems and good of this movie without wandering into spoiler territory, so I'll leave this vague yet hopefully helpful to readers.",1341532800,6,2179,4.706806282722513
4797999,4,B005LAIHY0,"<strong>Prometheus</strong> (Ridley Scott, 2012)

You know what? If <em>Prometheus</em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an <em>Alien</em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the <em>Alien</em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since <em>Cube</em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, <em>Prometheus</em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>Bladerunner</em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since <em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word ""sumptuous"" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.

The problem is, of course, that it <em>was</em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an <em>Alien</em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing <em>Alien Resurrection</em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than <em>Alien<supr>3</supr></em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true <em>otaku</em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> in any way.

There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.

NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.

Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (<em>Devil</em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more, ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.

[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]

So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (<em>The Adventures of Priscilla</em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (<em>Monster</em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (<em>Shame</em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there (""God does not create in straight lines,"" as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...

As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to <em>Prometheus</em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in <em>Shame</em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) ""was David gay?"". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware <em>Shame</em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than ""provide non-controversy to get butts in seats."" Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.

But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first <em>Alien</em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually <em>is</em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: <em>2001</em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. <em>That</em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** ",1341532800,4,7417,4.983844911147012

4798002,5,B005LAIHY0,"Those who are familiar with the names Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger & ""Alien"" got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of ""Prometheus"". It's story, plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it. The mystery surrounding the movie is as intense, mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review. In fact, the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film. You will get great science fiction, intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world.

Don't talk to many people who have already seen ""Prometheus"" before going. You don't want to know. If you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the ""Alien"" series of movies, just go. ""Prometheus"" is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It isn't for the squeamish. I will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well.

Those familiar with the ""Alien"" series are also familiar with the name ""Weyland Industries"". They are the corporation behind the original ""Alien"" movies. They are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms. So when Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace (who rose to fame with the Swedish ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" movies), finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar, it leads her and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway to question our origins. Who are we and where did we come from?

""Prometheus"" is more thought provoking than action movie. Not to say that the action isn't plentiful, but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch, as well as the acting, direction and cinematography. There really isn't much to criticize about the film. ""Prometheus"" is pure and simple, great escapism cinema. You will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking, wondering and cringing.

There have been a great variety of summer movies this year and Hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers. We want variety. ""Prometheus"" is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time, emphasis on the science. It mixes the ""Alien"" genre with a great movie like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It does what every great movie should do, make you question and make you think. Go, before you hear anything more about it.",1341446400,14,2312,4.83080808080808
4798003,1,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus has mixed reviews and I can see why. Its part genius and big let down. I mean it starts off amazing but the last 20 minutes felt like an episode from Buffy the Vampire slayer. Its like the producers inserted the big explosions at the end and edited out the better parts, like the scene with Guy Pierce giving a Ted talk (you can see it on Youtube, its better than the film). There were other clever scenes planned for Prometheus that didn't make it into the final cut.

I don't know why it's being marketed as a prequel to the Alien movies, this has nothing to do with Alien and Aliens, it isn't a prequel, it is sh't! Al

I reckon that the produces chickened out and dumbed it down for some reason...
Its like they showed another version to a group of people who didn't get it and so they cut all the cool stuff out and patched it up with rubbish.

I listened to Terry Gilliam once on the radio saying that Hollywood is reluctant to release a film unless it's first been viewed by a focus group. This way the film can better suit the tastes of the public, or to be more precise, the tastes of the small sample picked for the focus group, and because this tiny sample of humanity represents the rest of us, the film will be just great. So this boils down to about 40 people, picked at random from the public, like they do in jury service, choosing what goes into the final cut. It doesn't matter if the writer of the film is a genius, like Terry Gilliam, because these days, a jury of 'yahoos' choose how the film develops""! I borrowed the 'yahoo' bit from Bill Hicks who complained about the same phenomenon.

This 'sample of the public' that Terry Gilliam and Bill Hicks are talking about, or to use less Orwell-spach jargon, the whims of the average person, is reflected on the final cut of the film and this is why many films we see these days always end happily, even when the plot was obviously leading to a tragic finale, or the narrative sometimes seams 'chopped' and dumbed down in places and so confuses and abuses the intelligence of the paying viewer.

Welcome Prometheus, the biggest pile of horse dung the yahoos can muster!

I then began hearing mixed reviews, and became wary about seeing it for fear it would be an enormous let down for me. I finally got around to seeing it, and I just have to say I am not the least bit disappointed. There are a lot of things in this movie that require interpretation on the viewer's part; they are not spelled out for you immediately. It also requires some knowledge of the first Alien movie- not so much the sequels. And some understanding in Greek mythology and the bible as well. If you want to see a movie that just spells it all out for you and you just have to sit there and watch it, this isn't the one for you.

4798005,5,B005LAIHY0,"I have been a rabid fan of the Aliens series for decades. I've devoured every Aliens (and Predator) game, movie, comic book, and novel that has been released pretty much for the last twenty years, and while somewhat let down by the AVP 1 movie and almost completely let down by the AVP 2 movie, I knew that if Ridley Scott was directing a new movie that was a prequel to Alien, it would be great.

And it was. This movie had the huge epic feeling you only get from truly great science fiction; the LV-223 approach scene, the Prometheus in space (it's the name of the ship in the movie), all the locations on the alien planet, and just everything about the movie was so well done and so polished. I went to see it twice in the theater in the same week, which is something I very rarely do, and usually when I do that the second time I see the movie my enjoyment of it is diminished a little bit or I find a few cracks or flaws in it - but not with Prometheus - I enjoyed it even more the second time.

So now for the geek details, by category of things I care about seeing in an Aliens film:

Xenomorphology (alien life): Absolutely killer. I am refraining from spoilers here but let me tell you that every form of alien life you see in this movie really does seem that - alien. As it should be. More than anything else, I am interested in the alien lifeforms and alien ecology in the Aliens universe, and Scott did an awesome job of introducing some new creatures to the mythology without corrupting anything else already in place - which is saying a lot.

Action: No, this is not a movie involving the Colonial Marines, and no this is not, per se, a purely action movie, so you do not have any scenes with handfuls of Aliens swarming soldiers carrying automatic weaponry - because this is hundreds of years before the Colonial Marines even existed, anyway. This movie is instead a SCIENCE FICTION movie - not an Action/Sci-Fi movie or a Sci-Fi/Action movie. It's a film about the most realistic possible depiction of exactly what could possibly happen when we finally encounter alien life.

Acting: Despite some others' opinion to the contrary, I felt that the acting in this movie was perfect. Not kind of great, but perfect - spot on. Especially the second time I watched it, I was repeatedly struck by how interesting of a web of relationships and interactions all the characters had with each other. I found all the characters believable and interesting. On that note, Michael Fassbender as David was literally mind-blowingly good. I found myself actually sympathizing with him more often than some of the human protagonists. And Noomi Rapace as the female lead was stunningly good.

Feeling of Immersion / 3D: Absolute. I saw not a single molecule of anything in the film that detracted from my immersion in its universe. In fact, I had to remind myself to actually move around at several points throughout the film (both times I watched it) because I would realize that I had been sitting perfectly still doing nothing but watching. And the 3-D, a gimmick which I have almost universally despised in movies since the new 3D DLP technology came out a few years ago because most of the time directors use it as an excuse to throw in multiple ""someone is jabbing something in your face, LOOK, HERE'S THE 3-D EFFECT!"" scenes, was actually very subtle for the most part - which made it extremely effective.

Storyline: I thought the storyline was great. Some have complained about it, but I didn't find any flaws in it. I think something needs to be said here; I have noticed many of the detractors are saying that the plot had holes in it; that there was ""no explanation"" for one or more of the things that happened during the movie (trying to leave out spoilers here, so I can't be more specific). To those people, I would say ""Then don't watch a science fiction movie. Watch one that has no fantasy or sci fi elements to it."" The entire reason I watch, and, I suspect, many people watch, science fiction is to experience an ALTERNATE reality - one in which fantastic things happen that we let ourselves be carried away by and immersed in. NOT one that we audit mercilessly, picking apart each scene or possibility until we find something we can qualify as a flaw which then somehow unravels the entire movie. And besides, I'm an expert at noticing plot holes, flaws, and badly conceived storylines in movies - they jump out at me like a sore thumb - and I did not detect a single one in Prometheus. Yes, I know that great science fiction usually involves things that are scientifically possible although out at the far edge of possibility - and this movie had just that.

Faithfulness to the Universe: A lot of people know everything about the Star Wars universe, or the Star Trek universe; I happen to know a lot about both but neither are my personal choice for ""Science Fiction Mythology of First Choice."" The Aliens universe is my first choice. Scott did such an incredible job of creating an amazing film set within that universe bursting with new ideas and new creatures without violating a single piece of the existing universe. Purists will call ""foul"" at this point, extracting examples from the Aliens Vs Predator movies here of how Prometheus doesn't match precisely with the version of the universe depicted in those movies, but....honestly the AVP films were pretty bad, regardless, and Ridley Scott and Giger invented the Aliens universe - so I think Scott has free license to basically ignore the AVP universe if he wants to.

Answers & Archives: I was very happy with the way that Scott worked in much of the material that HR Giger originally developed for the first Alien movie but they were not able to use at the time due to budget constraints. If you look at the portfolios of art that Giger did back in the late 70's for Alien, much of what is in Prometheus was actually visualized then by Giger, and it's great to see a director fulfilling Giger's vision on film in an Aliens movie. It was exactly what I wanted to see, and Scott did it perfectly.

Series Continuity / Fit with Existing Aliens Films: The entire thing is a brilliantly directed, wonderfully executed Part 1 of the prequel series to Alien. And a word on that; don't forget this is only ONE of TWO Alien prequels that Scott has planned. For anyone not understanding how this movie links up to Alien after they've seen it, don't forget that Scott never planned to answer all the questions in this movie that link up to Alien - there is still another entire movie worth of things that has to happen before we will come up to the doomed crew of the Nostromo, timeline-wise.

Conclusion: I rarely buy movies anymore, because I almost never want to watch them more than once - but I'll be pre-ordering the most content-heavy version of this movie I can. I'd recommend it quite highly to anybody.",1341360000,10,6881,4.563562753036437

4798007,4,B005LAIHY0,"This film is visually jaw-dropping on a big screen. I would go so far as to say that this movie looked better at the theater than anything I have seen in years. We have a sizable home theater, but I am glad I did not wait for the video release. A friend strongly recommended seeing it in 3D. Having seen it in that format, I disagree. Some of the scenes are very dark. While the 3D is done pretty well, I do not think you necessarily have to see it in 3D - in fact I think it gave some of the very dark scenes a muddied appearance. I do not yet own the 3D blu-ray, so I cannot comment on how the darkest scenes translate to home systems.

From a technical standpoint this film is Ridley Scott on steroids. It is shot very well. The cinematography, editing, effects, acting, sounds and action sequences are all done extremely well. There are a couple of action sequences in particular that are just relentless and leave you feeling drained. This is the type of film that sucks you in and doesn't let you catch your breath. I'm not even a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, but I could easily watch this again.

If Amazon allowed half-stars, I would probably give this film four and a half stars instead of four. It isn't a perfect five star film. There is a tremendous amount of violence and some of it is very gory - bordering on gratuitous in a place or two. While I wasn't especially bothered, the person next to me hated it for that very reason. The storyline does have a few weak points, but nothing too serious. Also, I thought the ending was OK, but not as believable as it could have been. Again, none of these things mattered a great deal to me, I was very impressed with this movie. The biggest drawback for me personally was experiencing some of the excessively dark scenes in 3D - I would probably watch the 2D version if I had it to do over. I actually caught myself removing the glasses a couple of times, but of course that will just make things worse when watching 3D formatting.

4798008,4,B005LAIHY0,"It's really a great movie in terms of asking big questions and answering them. But you will have to think about the movie a long time after you see it to realize what the answers are.
My view of the facts of the story is that the Engineers land on an early lifeless earth, probably only one of them and probably by accident.  Faced with the lifeless world he commits suicide with biological self-destruct pills. This is where life including us comes from.  When the engineers take note of us they see us as vermin to be exterminated.  So they developed or deploy this biological weapons system called ""Alien"". And when the engineer awakes to find us there he just wants to kill us.
The old man who wants the creator to give him eternal life, and the engineer just wants, and makes him dead. This is worth the whole movie for itself. The Archeologist who wants to know what humanity did wrong for its creator to want to kill them off and ignoring that the fact is they probably regard her and her kind has vermin and what humanity did wrong was to evolve in the engineers image. Or maybe we found civilizations that might develop in their technological image. The concept of this sort of view for parents and children and religion is a very interesting statement.  Its things we don't like to see and you get lost in the action of the movie while seeing it and only realize the message when you think about it later.  If the Archeologist does make it to the Engineers home world she will probably not like the reception.
From a space opera stand point the way the engineers use biological weapons rather than mechanical ones is interesting and pretty unique.",1341187200,4,1657,4.51

4798082,3,B005LAIHY0,"In a movie theater, everyone can hear you scream. In frustration.

Prometheus is one of those movies you hear about whose pedigree alone is enough to get your blood pumping. Directed by Ridley Scott, the creator and director of the first Alien film, and set up as a self-contained and whole-new story parallel to the other Alien films, it had a lot going for it out of the gate. That also means it had high expectations to deliver on  from fans and critics alike. After all, Aliens was the first action film to win an Academy Award (citation needed). Sigourney Weaver, who played Lieutenant Ripley in the other movies, almost set up an archetype on her own. And let's not forget, the Alien films have had an unquantifiable influence on video games.

There is a lot to be said for Prometheus. It had a remarkable production value, and a strong cast of talented actors. It had an excellent cannon mythology to draw from, and, of course, the adoration of millions. It is a shame then that so much went wrong to produce one of the series' more unforgettable entries.
Warning: Spoilers below. Proceed at your own caution.

Let me begin with the good. The movie is remarkably well-shot, but then, we expect that from a Ridley Scott film. The cinematography is full of gorgeous landscapes that expand beyond the typical helicopter pans. The few shots in space are exceptional as well, ands of course, the dripping, dank corridors under the ""pyramid"" are happily reminiscent of the true-blooded Alien films. It's important to keep in mind that almost all of the indoor sets are ""practical effects,"" which is an impressive feat of its own.

Scott uses an excellent design aesthetic to establish a brightly-colored and suitably neon futurist look. Underground, he sticks to what works: cramped, shadowy and uncomfortably organic halls and corridors that bend just enough that they might hide a monster behind them.

But that's the problem with this movie. It isn't a creature feature. Instead of following the tried and true formula of unassuming blue collar people making a horrendous discovery,  fighting, and dying horribly to stop the alien from spreading, Prometheus tries to tell a creation story. Therefore, since we know that there are aliens, and from the opening scene we know what they look like, it gets weird. Indeed, the crew of Prometheus, the (titular) ship, are going to find them after discovering an identical array of stars on several ancient cave paintings. This is the first of the film's many drops of logic, as we learn from the founder of the film's nefarious Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland (played, for some reason I can't fathom, by a badly-made up Guy Pearce) that the trip isn't a mining expedition, it's an archeological/contact mission!

This, naturally, upsets the crew of geologists and miners, who are in disbelief. So are the viewers, who already knew it wasn't a mining expedition. Why are we wasting time with a seemingly pointless lie? Why were the miners tricked into coming along? Who are these two ""biologists"" spreading nonsense about humanity being ""engineered""? In fact, one of the characters goes so far as to ask, ""How do you explain three hundred years of Dawinian Evolution?""

The answer is, you don't, as the film forgets that question like a toddler amped on sugar. But it's OK, because the unbeliever gets his faceplate melted onto his head by a cobra-like variant for the xenomorph. Serves him right for asking questions, no? F**k the scientific method.

The inability to answer--and in some cases even remember--the questions Prometheus raises is the lynch-pin problem of the movie. As a film, it has a collective memory of about two minutes. For example, in the second act, after the engineers are officially ""discovered,"" one of the lead ""scientists"" descends into a juvenile, brooding drunken depression, because he didn't find any of the ""engineers"" alive. BUT THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ON LV-223 FOR A DAY. A SINGLE EARTH DAY. Likewise, when one of the crew is resurrected as a zombie (or something?) and kills a bunch of the unnamed blue collar maintenance dudes, the captain calmly destroys it, no one ever mentions it again, and that's that.

This ignorant bliss plagues the movie from start to finish. In fact, Prometheus is one of those unfortunate films that really suffers from the loose-thread (or chin-scratching question-raising) problem: when you tug at one stray end, the entire carpet unravels. For some films, tugging one stray thread leads to a long and interesting discussion about technique, metaphor , or narrative. Not so here. This is hugely unfortunate, because the movie is ambitious. Scott and company were clearly trying to do something new with the source material,but they stepped too far and fell right on their plate glass helmets.

Which reminds me: for some reason, the explorers have space suits that break and smash with the slightest impact. This doesn't make any sense, given that we have better technology right now. In fact, we have since the 1950s. But that is the unfortunate bad science that you have to swallow from Prometheus. Bad tech and nonsense science are as common as are the many unanswered questions. One last nerve-grating example: using an electric wand to ""trick a two thousand year old corpse into thinking its alive,"" thereby failing to properly observe standard and common quarantine rules the world over, and put the entire entire crew at risk. It's also just stupid.

I could rant for a long time about the quarrels and qualms I had with this film, but its just a waste of breath. Ultimately, despite the stupid inconsistencies and errors, I did enjoy it. Mostly. I've never been a huge fan of Ridley Scott's films as narrative vehicles anyway: its his cinematic sense that catches me. They are strangely and startlingly beautiful pieces, each in their own way, that establish unique aesthetic grooves for the future of their respective genres. Take for instance the importance of the slick, oily, and cramped vision of LA in Blade Runner, and compare that to the sci-fi movies that followed. Compare Alien to the dozens of knock-off ET creature features; Gladiator to the dozens of Roman-inspired films. And as a movie, Prometheus is a visual masterpiece, one which I really hope that future sci-fi directors take a strong cue from in the visual department. The contrasting colors, the stark and grim caverns, and the obsessive attention to detail are wonderful. Watch it for that experience alone, but do not expect a follow-up (or lead-up, anyway) to Alien that matches the 1979 masterpiece for tone, vibe, or intelligence.

And don't expect to have many questions answered, either. Also, to paraphrase a friend, future space-explorer underwear is incredibly boring. Shaw haw nothing on Ripley.",1341100800,5,6798,4.983245149911816
4798083,3,B005LAIHY0,"One of my favorite things about the first two Alien movies is the seamless way they managed to merge the horror and scifi genres, something that many writers and directors have stumbled with since then.  This movie, however, is not a cross-genre masterpiece, it's strictly a scifi movie with some gross moments, like a rated R episode of Star Trek or something.  There is also little in the way of sympathetic characters, with probably Theron (who is a coward, but trying to fight against her natural instincts to, just once, impress probably the only person she cares about besides herself, so is maybe the most human of the characters) and Elba being the only ones with truly three dimensional characterization.

The plot is very reminiscent of Dead Space, particularly the first cartoon movie.  It also doesn't seem to entirely know what it wants to be.  There are different threads picked up, or at least hinted at, and then thrown away, as the movie eventually approaches a conclusion that is full of holes, which many of the rabid fans will say either don't exist (by offering made-up explanations that are hardly supported by the movie) or that we don't understand because we're not intelligent enough to do so (generally the fall back of people who feel stupid while watching movies).  The 'main' tie-in to the rest of the franchise (which is spoiler-y so I'm not going to go into detail) is also just ridiculous, the very existence of it so convoluted and weird that it makes me hate that it was even there, especially since it seemed to be fan service more than anything else.

Is this a good movie on its own, looking at it without the franchise?  Not really.  It's a mediocre movie that looks very nice and has some very big names.  If it didn't have the pedigree it has, it would probably have very little attention and make money only if it was the only genre choice the weeks it was out.  In many ways it reminds me of the movie Sunshine, including the way the writing falls apart in the last act.

I'm hoping the Blu Ray will include footage of the concept and set design, as I've read articles on it and the process does sound fascinating.  The best part about the movie was how it looked, so if you're into the visual aspect of movies, I do recommend seeing it.  It's also, I guess, worth seeing if you're a fan of the franchise and can deal with the way this messes up the timeline and leaves you with questions that you never even wanted.  I'll update once I've looked through the blu-ray and watched the extras, which will hopefully make watching the movie yet again worth it.",1341100800,6,2597,4.578833693304536
4798084,4,B005LAIHY0,"I saw the movie in the theatre and came away with mixed emotions. It is in essence a prequel for the Aliens franchise. In that regard I would rank it third in the series behind the original Alien and the follow up Aliens, but ahead of Alien 3.
The production quality is strong, though I'm not a fan of 3D. At this time I still find it clumsy and clunky to always have to wear the glasses and readjust them on my face through out a movie. I look forward to the eventual day when 3D movies will be viewed without glasses at all. Till then, I'd just as soon stick with 2D.
The directions is generally good and the charactors and acting is good. The story however has a few holes and as always some of the charactors do the dumbest things you can imagine when faced with life threatening situations. You'd think they'd have more sense - but of course if they weren't that stupid, they wouldn't get killed in the first place and the movie would lose much of it's pop.
I liked the ""origin"" aspect and the exestential questions the movie asks, very good.
I take one star away for the writting of some of the charactors parts and their actions/reactions in certain scenes.

4798198,3,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" recycles a lot of material from the Alien franchise: monsters bursting out of people, flying squids with whip-like tentacles, even the Alien creature itself. There is also an android crew member and a determined heroine, just like the other Alien movies.

The plot centers on a team of scientists who land on a planet thought to be inhabited by extraterrestrial beings. One of the scientists thinks the beings created humans, but there is no evidence of this. Later on, a specimen is recovered and its DNA sequence is found to match human DNA. All this proves is that we are related to the beings, not that they bioengineered us from scratch. We could have been deposited here by another intelligence and left to evolve before the beings discovered us.

If the beings did create us, did they create us in our present state, or did they create earlier homo species? If they created earlier homo species, they would have to have created chimpanzees. The reductio leads to the conclusion that they created all life on the planet. It is too much of a leap to say they created us.

The crew thinks the beings (the ""Engineers"" as they call them) are using the planet ruins as a biowarfare lab to exterminate humans. Eventually, one of the Engineers is awakened from a stasis chamber and tries to kill the expedition team. So, clearly there are signs that the beings are hostile. But at the end, Noomi Rapace announces that she wants the android to fly her to the Engineer home world. If they want to exterminate humans, why would she want to go near them? And how would they sneak in there? They'd be intercepted and killed before they could touch down.

Like most science fiction films, the extraterrestrials say nothing interesting. There is no indication that the beings are intelligent aside from their technology. The film makers need to do more than show us the interior of their spaceship to demonstrate their eminence. After all, the awakened Engineer behaves like an uncaged brute. Instead of exuding a god-like aura, it acts like a humanoid version of the Giger alien.

This is not a bad movie, but how about giving audiences something new? Give us extraterrestrials who say intelligent things, not brutes with advanced technology. We've seen the Giger aliens enough already.",1340755200,8,2292,4.836734693877551

4798201,5,B005LAIHY0,"Generally I do not review movies. I give more attention to the written word. But having just seen PROMETHEUS at a theater, I know as a science fiction fan and as an appreciator of A-quality films that this was a good solid movie that would be bashed by many ignorant viewers who do not understand why this good movie does not deserve to be bashed. I have not read any reviews, but I imagine some viewers will bash PROMETHEUS because it was not as good as the original ALIEN or because it did not give them an orgasm while they watched it.

Well, it is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie. Nor are most good movies, and you are going to starve to death if your hunger for a good movie is not satiated unless it makes you stand up and cheer. No, it did not have the impact of the original ALIEN, but that was because the original ALIEN was original and for that reason you should not expect an ALIEN tie-in to be better.

Nevertheless PROMETHEUS has many excellent things going for it. One is the acting, which--from my perspective as an amateur--seemed perfect. No one smiled out of place. The characterizations were presented earnestly with depth and convincingness. Though when everyone does a good job at acting, maybe the credit should go to the director. Another excellent thing was the artwork. Cinematics, sound, art, background, props--they were all science fictionally immersive, setting a proper, believable atmosphere. I especially appreciated the concept of the Engineers, the giant hereditary progenitors of human beings. They were a good conceptual take on the mythological Greek Titans and they put Michelangelo's David to shame.

Certainly the movie had its flaws. Every movie does. But they are not worth pointing out because the movie is worth your time. The story is pretty much a platitude, reminiscent of preceding ALIEN movies. Still it holds together logically, well enough, and it pulls you on so you can experience the good sound and visuals and the suspense. And if you don't stand up and cheer at the ending, you can at least be pleased that Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is one tough gal, with heart, soul, and inspiration.",1340668800,9,2134,4.777777777777778
4798202,4,B005LAIHY0,"It has been over thirty years since director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) made two highly influential, game-changing science fiction films, Alien and Blade Runner.  Now he revisits his earliest triumph, Alien, not as a sequel but as a kind of prequel that has threads connecting both films.  An intelligent science fiction film with elements of horror, Prometheus embraces bold concepts of human origin and its creation by `ancient astronauts'.  The film is not quite a classic, but should thoroughly satisfy purists and general moviegoers alike.

An archeological couple has pieced together remarkable clues from early human drawings revealing a stellar map that may lead to the source of mankind.  The couple, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), join a crew and its Captain Janek (Idris Elba) on a two year mission to a mysterious planet aboard the spaceship Prometheus.  Financed by the Weyland Corporation and represented by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the only non-human on board is an android named David (Michael Fassbender).  Prometheus lands near some structures which, upon investigation, reveal evidence of life, but the discovery has startling implications leading to a desperate struggle for survival that threatens the earth.

The film is not without some surprises and plot twists, and without giving too much away, Scott likes to end his films with an ambiguous sense of hope.  There are some unanswered questions, however, and there is one glaring injustice that gets lost amid the film's fascinating conclusion.  One pivotal, incredible scene involves a remarkable, graphic emergency surgery that strains the limits of credibility, but nevertheless holds the viewers' agonized attention.

The story has a compelling setup and when the crew goes inside the structure, they discover a series of chambers that takes the journey closer to potential answers or deadly threat.  It's like the ultimate funhouse of terrors.  It's also a safe bet that nasty things happen when curious humans meet invasive, alien life forms.

Having to live up to its predecessor, Prometheus builds its own fascinating world and broadens storyline implications for future films. It's not Alien, whose novelty and groundbreaking creature designs stunned audiences, but there are certainly enough connections to draw parallels between the two films. Alien is referenced in several ways including bits of dialogue, a sampling of Jerry Goldsmith's original theme, and culminating with markedly familiar set pieces.  (Ironically Alien itself was a big budget reworking of a B-movie, It the Terror from Beyond Space.)

The film does feel a bit derivative at times and borrows liberally from other science fiction classics.  The early scenes where David is the only conscious crew member who wiles away his solitary existence with basketball, watching holographic dreams of the hibernating crew, and admiring Lawrence of Arabia, harken back to the Discovery crew of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Some scenes are not original as they seem lifted right out of Alien vs. Predator, Leviathan and various episodes of TV's The X Files.

Fassbender, who shines in the film, does a very convincing job imbuing his android with almost human characteristics and a potentially sinister side.  Think of 2001's disembodied computer HAL and you get the idea.  Strong female leads are a staple of Scott's films (Thelma and Louise), and Rapace is a strong female heroine whose faith is sorely tested amid personal loss and her obsessive hunt for the truth about mankind's beginnings.

Cinematography has always been a strong point in Scott's films, and the film's stunning visuals display the planet's otherworldly beauty.  The production design is imaginative particularly inside the structure with its myriad of biomechanical architecture and impressive special effects.  Swiss artist H. R. Giger, who designed the original Alien monster, contributes a bit of reverse engineering that fans will appreciate.

Prometheus is a thought provoking adventure that not only can stand on its own, but rises tall among most science fiction films.  It's a visually impressive epic with an ambitious agenda that doesn't completely work, but even so, this antecedent to Alien is a worthy bookend to the series.",1340668800,11,4340,5.411589895988113

The previews of this film with its horrifying soundtrack made this film look like the must-see film of the year! Too bad the previews were the best thing about this film.

Oh I can see where the money was spent - it's a big involved production and they've got some really great talent wondering what the heck they're doing in this lousy film.  I'm sure the producers had to pay the actors more when the actors realized what a horrible film this was.

Why is Charlize Theron - arguably one of the most beautiful women in the world - and an incredible actress - ....why is she only delivering a flat ""angry"" performance? No range. Terrible.

Guy Pearce - why bother hiring this fine actor if you're going to cover him up in some of the poorest old age make-up I've seen this side of a high school play?  He's completely wasted - but then so is the whole storyline involving him.

Is there any reason that ""humanoid"" beings populated the Earth and finding them so Pearce's character can find immortality?

The plot line is paper thin and very juvenile compared to the original Alien and its first sequel Aliens. The characters are so poorly drawn that you really don't care whether anyone lives or dies.  When they do start dying, I began rooting for the aliens because the humans were all so pathetic and uninteresting.

Edit:
Got a question regarding successful rich and powerful person Weyland in the movie:
Let's see Weyland can spend trillions for personal reasons, who does he hire?
1. Archeologist who is so stupid that she says this is scientific expedition, you will not need your weapons. What's worse is the guy listened.
2. Other archeologist did not report worm like infection in his eye, pretend like its nothing and went back on ahead to expedition.
3. Geologist hired to map the facility gets lost trying to find his way back.
4. Biologist stupid enough to try and pet an alien creature.
5. Weyland's bodyguard fires at Engineer's body which could be bullet proof suit, and not put a bullet to the uncovered head.
6. David gets himself killed when he either trying to get his ""father"" killed or communicate for his father, either way not so effective.
Weyland for a rich and powerful guy sure surround himself with incompetent people. Or maybe the inflation rate is so high, the trillion dollar is like our present day million dollars? Only way to explain the ""quality"" of employees he hired to save his life.

BTW I know I am going to get lots of ""unhelpful"" on my feedback, that is the risk of bad review on a ""popular"" movie to a group of fans to a series or director.  Just like giving a bad review on a bad StarTrek movie and what Trekkies would react to that review.

I even pre-ordered this 3D Blueray before the movie came out, that is how much I wanted this movie to be good.

- Another retarded paleontologist that has no right to the name of scientist and comes up with the ""engineer"" theory based only on her personal feelings and religious beliefs.
- Another retarded paleontologist that sees tentacles coming out of his eyes and hides the fact from everybody else for no reason at all.
- An emotionless robot that displays sarcasm and a varied set of other emotions.
- THE WORST SURGERY SCENE EVER SHOWN ON SCREEN OR OFF IT (by the way, displaying amazing lack of imagination and incredible ignorance; if the machine was programmed for males (supposedly, it's Wayland's), it should make a top-to-bottom incision, but it made a lateral incision, which is the one used in caesarian anyway. Also, no anesthetics from the supposedly standalone medical module (spray on skin does not count. And cauterizing and stapling to close the incision. Really, folks, that's just lack of imagination: they copied standard caesarian procedure, and made it a thousand times worse. If that's future medicine, I'm out of it!!!)
- Also, Shawn's inhuman resistance after the operation (the rest of the movie) is ridiculous.
- They open the door of the ship to something that's obviously not human, from its posture (impossible to a human), just because it's wearing Fifield's suit?!
- And then, the Engineers, the crowning imbeciles of all. Why did the engineer in the prologue have to sacrifice himself before the ship posturing as a sky god? Wouldn't just his blood with the black slime (which seems to create all kinds of life) work the same?
- I don't care why they wanted to destroy humanity. That's one of the films'  mysteries and it's ok. But why make a monster vector that implants other monsters inside people? That's stupid. A virus would work a lot better and be much more energy-saving to engineer (pardon the pun).
- Why does the awakened engineer charges blindly at the humans? He only succeeds because they had no weapons with them (oh, yes, another thing we have to thank Shawn's imbecility for). And then, after his ship has been crashed by the tiny humans, he goes charging after Shawn blindly and with his bare hands, again!!!!
The problem is that the characters are irrational and idiotic, when they should not be. They should be the cream of earth's scholars and scientists - remember, it's a trillion dollar mission to save Weyland's life. Why would he bet his life on imbeciles? And this never happens in good science fiction. but then again, I'm afraid those who think this is a good movie (aka good story, not good visuals, that you can get from a screen saver) have never read good science fiction, like Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, or Howard Philips Lovecraft (who mixes sci-fi and horror very well in his stories), and so many others that were REAL writers, not just people who put words together.
However, I haven't read the movie's original script yet. After I do, I'll find out whether the rumors that Scott messed with it are true, and discover that he has really embraced religious idiocy and bad Hollywood clichs.
But after Blade Runner he hasn't made a really good movie - except visually, they are all stunning. 1492 is so bad that he didn't even research history. People had known the Earth wasn't flat since the Middle Ages, and, in some cases, before that! This is just current-day clich from the historically-illiterate. So, I'm afraid Alien and Blade Runner are fortunate accidents and the rest of his opus just shows that the Congress should approve an act forbidding Riddley Scott from messing with film scripts or even choosing them. Just direct them they way they are, and everything will be fine. That law should also apply to James Cameron, with an addendum forbidding him to write his own scripts.

4798374,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus and the space ship are symbolic of Western civilization; the movie is a political allegory about how the global network of parasitical, usurious, NWO Central Banksters and their poisonous fiat money scams have drained the lifeblood out of Europe and the US.

Prometheus, who endured terrible suffering to give the gift of fire (creativity) to the Greeks (Western civilization), nevertheless decides to kill his progeny -- the humans who carry his DNA. Why? He concludes that neither he nor his progeny -- represented by the crew -- are capable of defending themselves against the ruthless, bloodsucking aliens. Rather than let his descendants become hosts for the destructive parasites, who cannot survive on their own without attaching themselves to a captive host population, Prometheus, as father, decides (as did the Romans) to exercise his right and responsibility to kill the members of his household -- earthlings.

Elizabeth Shaw, however, shows herself to be worthy of -- and even more inventive than -- her self-sacrificing progenitor, Prometheus. She tears the abominable alien parasite from her womb; she instructs her noble crew to save the earth by ramming their spaceship into Prometheus' ship to keep it from destroying earth; and she asserts her faith in Christendom by demanding that David give her the cross; she vows to go in search of her Maker despite the difficulties. The Germanische android, David, who served his grasping slavemaster Weyland, who showed himself willing to sacrifice the safety of the earth as well as the ship and its crew to prolong his own fading life, switches his allegiance from Weyland to Elizabeth. In David's words, Elizabeth has shown ""a remarkable sense of self-preservation."" David does all he can to help Elizabeth -- his unemotional, pristine intelligence is curious to know whether she can complete her quest.

The question remains: Will the United States eliminate the financial parasites and show the same sense of self-preservation as Elizabeth and the same sense of patriotic duty as her crew.

Just as God entrusted a woman, Mary, to give birth to Jesus, God has entrusted another woman, Elizabeth, to tear the Satanic parasite (the antithesis of Jesus) from her womb. Mary was victorious in her mission of giving birth to the light -- and Ridley Scott implies that Elizabeth will also be victorious in her mission to re-kindle the protective light of Christianity that has been deliberately and systematically dimmed in Western societies. Will the Hollywood Cabal subject Ridley Scott to the same defamation campaigns and ""honey pots"" that they inflicted on Mel Gibson in revenge for his movie, The Passion of Christ?",1340409600,16,2691,5.2078521939953815

4798376,2,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus failed to deliver anything new beyond the opportunity for a new franchise. The film stumbled forward on weak, underdeveloped legs rendering any potential overall concept flat on its face in the end. If there was an overall concept, it was unclear. Prometheus felt like a prequel to a film that hasn't been made yet, and one that I already don't care about.

Prometheus has been hailed as visually stunning--I think I have even seen the phrase ""visual masterpiece""--but I argue that the film didn't give us anything that we haven't seen before. We already know that filmmakers can dazzle us with anything that the mind can conceive. Stunning visuals are little more than a parlor trick nowadays, and certainly not enough to carry a film alone. The recently released Iron Sky, a low-budget Sci-Fi comedy, boasts stunning visuals that were easily as interesting as anything Prometheus has to offer. Big money and big visuals do not necessarily equal successful storytelling.

The screenplay was weak and full of half developed ideas, stumbling by opportunities to tell a story, or develop characters, in order to get to the next action sequence or opportunity for gore. Dialogue that was key to each moment had little impact on the overall flow of the plot. Character driven subplots, which should have meshed in with the overall story, were confusing and got lost along the way. By the time the film was over, I was left feeling like nothing had made sense except that the filmmakers wanted me to know that there would be another film.

I have read that the film left too many unanswered questions, but I felt that the film posed irrelevant questions (that I didn't have going in), and offered watered down answers. For instance, the film largely centers on the origins of human life, but the characters in the film didn't even seem all that excited about the question or the answer. The answer was provided in the first moments of the film and was as interesting the origins of toothpicks. Prometheus also attempted to answer questions that I (as a fan) was supposed to have (but didn't), and did so with underwhelming results (e.g. the Space Jockey). I already knew it was the pilot of a ship. The film attempted too much in terms of touching on big questions, and too little in terms of telling a good story. As a result the film left me feeling wholly disinterested.

Sometimes poor dialogue and lack of plot can be rescued by really good characters--sometimes. The characters in the film were either over-the-top-archetypal (the maverick pilot), confusing (the archaeologist/lover/""X Games type scientist""), boring (the archaeologist wrestling with her faith AND a squid), pointless (dying billionaire and CEO, who dies), or left me with a question that I probably wasn't supposed to have (""Why is she here?""--the angry, sexy, might-be-a-robot, corporate crony, who wants her maker dead?). The only character that I found the least bit interesting was the android (David) played by Michael Fassbender, but I didn't understand his motivations at all, which left me feeling the same way that I felt about the rest of the characters--I didn't care about any of them. It was sad to see so much talent wasted on characters that couldn't be saved from dull aliens or bad writing.

This film had nothing that I had hoped for. I went in hoping to see exciting and new visual spectacles, but I got a McCathedral. I went in hoping for great story telling, but I got a condensed version of the three bears. I went in hoping for complex and compelling characters, but I got Saturday morning cartoon versions of them. I went in hoping for the reveal of some exciting new aliens, but was greeted by cuttlefish and...extraterrestrial body builders (?). I don't get it. This film had so much going for it, until they made it.

Prometheus' ego was as big as its budget. And as it is with most big egos, they can't see their own shortcomings, and everyone kisses their bu...budget. ""The bigger the ego, the harder they fall,"" it has been said. I think that, while Prometheus may not fall hard, it will fall out of people's minds. This is one of the most forgettable films I have ever seen. But hey, maybe its offspring will fare better. It does, after all, have great DNA.

--UPDATE--

If you're interested in learning about the probable DNA behind the Prometheus story, I recommend looking into the Gnostic texts of the Nag Hammadi. The Apocalypse of Adam, one of the Nag Hammadi texts, seems to offer numerous parallels. Of course, a background in Gnosticism will help, as there are numerous characters one should be familiar with. If you're not familiar with Gnostic ideas, simply look up the Nag Hammadi on Wikipedia. There's enough information there to help a person become familiar with the ideas that likely underpin this film.",1340409600,20,4830,4.846060606060606

This is a tough film to award stars for.  I really wanted to like it and it delivers masterfully on a visual level.  There are also some very good individual scenes.  Unfortunately, the screenplay is pretty much a mess.  It's hard to imagine that such an unprofessional, irrational group of characters would be selected for such an important mission.  Exhibit A: the team members who decide to bail in the middle of a trip to an alien relic because they decide it's too scary but also think it's a good idea to try to pet a weird-looking alien.  The film also raises a lot of unanswered questions about the Engineers and their motivations.  I enjoy it when a well-written film declines to answer all the questions it raises, but this script has so many inconsistencies that any planned ambiguities get lost in the general sloppiness.

Nevertheless, since I can't award half-stars, I'm going with four instead of three.  I was consistently entertained by the effects and performances, there are some great set pieces (such as a brutal dust storm), and I can't deny a certain thrill at the iconic sight of (SPOILER AHEAD!) an Engineer transforming into the Space Jockey from ""Alien"" as he seats himself at the controls of his ship.

4798503,4,B005LAIHY0,"I've had the pleasure of seeing Prometheus twice. The first occasion was my first exposure to IMAX/3D and it was easily the best presentation I have ever seen in a theater. That prompted me to share the experience with two UK friends who were in town for my 50th birthday. Yes, I'm old.

The most difficult thing to overcome when reviewing Prometheus is separating the incredible presentation from the story. Should I review the experience, or just the movie itself? I have chosen to comment on both elements.

The opening shots immediately draw you in and establish that you are about to witness something special in terms of presentation. As the camera pans over the surface of a moon, you are part of the experience. As with Avatar, you are transported to a different world. The first shot of the ship is also effective, with the roar of the engines. Kubrick would probably turn over in his grave at the technical error of portraying sound in space, but it does add something for the viewer.

Prometheus is quite ambitious. It does a good job of explaining some of the events that led up to the mission in Alien. We are shown some of the discoveries which prompted the Weyland Corporation to explore deep space. A crew is sent to search for an incredible secret, which I won't reveal here. Unlike other films in the Alien franchise, the presence of an android is explained from the beginning. David (Fassbender) is accepted for what he is without anything being hidden. The one thing that does remain consistent is that the android knows more than he admits. Where did he get that information?

There is more than one alien species present in Prometheus, plus the humans. The story explains the origin of the type of ship discovered in Alien and we experience a small thrill of recognition. Ridley Scott balances new information with previous events in an effective way. I came away feeling like I knew a lot more about this universe, but I didn't feel that the original film had been betrayed in any way.

It took me several viewings over a number of years to raise my rating for Alien to 4.5/5. Perhaps because I know that film so well, Prometheus had more of an immediate impact. However, there is one thing preventing me from rating the film as highly. The character of Fifield (Sean Harris) is a blatant flaw in the film. He's a British geologist with the personality of an idiotic criminal. He's clearly intended to provide comic relief, and I admit that the audience did laugh at his comments during both viewings, but his inclusion felt so out of place. Up until that point, the film had me fully engaged. The story seemed plausible and interesting. Fifield would never have passed any serious attempt at psychological screening by the Weyland Corporation and would never have become part of the crew in any realistic scenario. His inclusion pulled me right out of the movie as soon as he spoke his opening dialogue. His scenes with Millburn (Rafe Spall) were all ludicrous and I'm forced to deduct half a point just because of their presence.

Everything else worked.

I'm not against the idea of humor in a serious movie. Vickers (Theron) and Janek (Idris Elba) did have an amusing exchange which was handled in a far more intelligent manner. Theron played her part well and her icy personality was believable.

The highlight of the film for me was the unexpectedly wonderful performance from Noomi Rapace. I liked her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was pleasantly surprised to see her tackling a role in English. Like Alien, the movie ends with a fight for survival, and Shaw (Rapace) is the equivalent of Ripley. There's one sequence which made me laugh because it was so outlandish, but Rapace played it totally straight and still had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for her. This will upset some people, but I think she was a more effective character than Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I like both tremendously, so I guess it doesn't matter.

Prometheus delivers in terms of story, action, and special effects, and most of the acting is good. The conclusion left the possibility of a sequel and I wouldn't be sorry to see that happen. It's always tricky when a franchise is continued after a long absence, but Scott really pulled it off. See it in IMAX/3D while you can and buy the Blu-ray when it is eventually released.",1340236800,17,4382,4.710182767624021
4798504,3,B005LAIHY0,"3 Star Film. 1 Star if you've seen and are a fan of the Alien franchise. 5 Stars if you've never seen the Alien films.
Superb visuals. Acting was decent to very well, in my opinion. Story was my main issue. This is set in the Alien universe, years before the first film, but this creates the issues mostly due to problems with the production staff. Ridley Scott was trying to make a not too direct prequel to Alien. However, the head writer, Damon Lindelof, was trying to expand the universe with whole new characters and a whole new franchise that wouldn't go anywhere near Aliens and Ellen Ripley. Basically a spinoff franchise. You combine these two visions and you get Prometheus. A disappointment for Alien fans (as I will discuss below) and a decent sci-fi film for those who have never seen Alien and its sequels. I will go on to say, however, whether an Alien fan or a new viewer, this film does have an ominous ending leaving old and new questions unanswered on purpose for hopes of a definite sequel.

SPOILERS AHEAD.

This was a complicated movie as it raised hopes for those of us who have seen the Alien franchise and eager to see this supposed prequel to explain the origins of the Alien. However, it didn't quite do that. As my post title says, this movie created more questions than it answered. This movie goes off in a tangent explaining supposedly who/what created the aliens and mankind itself, but there are just too many problems. First off, it doesn't really tell us where the Alien came from. Supposedly, some say the Engineers made them, indirectly, as some sort of biological weapon. Indirectly because if the engineers ingest the black spore liquid, they literally start dissolving. Other creatures are mutated into killing machines, such as the worms or maggots in the room with the Giant head turning into the snake like hammerpedes, or the geologist turning into some sort of hills have eyes super strong punk monster. Holloway, however, only had a very low dose of the black spore liquid so it was slowly killing him and mutating him. His mutated sperm was somehow able to impregnate a sterile woman, with what turns out to be some sort of facehugger, which attachs to an engineer and has some sort of xenomorph pop out of his chest, possibly an ancestral precursor to the familiar aliens as it does not fully have all their characteristics. This would make some sense if it wasn't for the plot hole of the biologist and the geologist looking at a mural in the room with the giant head of what is obviously an Alien that looks exactly like the ones from the original films. Why would the Engineers have a mural of the familiar Alien if it has never been encountered before (if you follow the process the movie has that I outlined above)? And why would they have a mural of it anyway, like it's some sort of god to them or something? Scott says if they make a sequel and it is successful, its successor (a third movie) would be the direct link between these new movies and the original Alien. Unless Lindelof is involved. He says if Scott and the studios want to work with him, they have to move the new franchise away from the old. I think this guy trying to sabotage the Alien prequel is more intense than the entire movie. I hope Ridley Scott and James Cameron get beck to trying to make a fifth Alien movie with each other. That would have to be great.",1340236800,5,3386,4.540098199672668

Sci fi movies are supposed to contain intelligent characters. In this film many act in a completely illogical manner, some are even eligible for Darwin awards.

The geologist and biologist characters seemed intelligent at first, being skeptical and cautious about the alien environment they were exploring. After they become seperated from their crew the biologist decides it is a good idea to pet the hostile alien snake creature and both end up getting killed or infected in a scene that looks like it was created purely for the spectacle. WTF were they thinking?

The geologist later shows up at Prometheus' doorstep as a zombie in an unusual yoga pose (reminiscent of an posessed character in a exorcist/japanese horror film, just plain lame) and none of the crew notice his unusual appearance and end up getting killed.

There are many other plot/character irregularities that have been posted all over the internet so I won't repeat them here.

The harsh tone of a distant Arctic land (actually Iceland) can grab the viewer. I went back to the movie theater twice after the first viewing and still marveled at the cold and dangerous place.

Director Ridley Scott once again showed his touch for the artistic and stunning. He also did the original 1979 film and then no more. Like some other reviewers I long felt that ""Alien"" was one of the best all-time science fiction movies. Right there with 2001,and in some ways much better.

Scott said he wanted to go back and find out more about that giant pilot with an exploded chest in a crashed ship on a distant moon. Where was that alien from, and on what kind of mission?

To make up for lost time, Scott loads Prometheus with lots of high-tech, plot and characters (the ship now has a crew of 17.) But you will still find the evil corporation reps there, along with a very determined Ripley type, played by Noomi Rapace of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo."" She really carries on the Ripley determination. And don't forget the robot---here identified right from the start. But which side is he on?

There is a new dimension to the Alien story which where prehistoric cave paintings seem to point toward that distant moon, and our ancestors (or creators?)

Lots of excitement, and  very scary moments.

You might wonder whether the certain sequel to this prequel will develop the distant ancestors as the prime feature. Such questions can lead to many ideas while you are out on a summer night with your telescope, or naked eye, just looking at the stars. And wondering.

For sure you see they wanted you to know that this was set in the Alien universe, but don't go in expecting Alien. I think Ridley Scott and Co. were better off not mentioning Alien at all. This would've quelled the criticism the movie got because now people have an expectation that may not have been intended. If people weren't given hints of the connection, it would've given a surprise that was unexpected but also more open minds looking at this as it's own thing. This brought the quality down for me because my head was filled with too much information beforehand. Now you have no choice but to look for something else you weren't meant to be looking for. That made this kind of predictable. I knew mostly everyone was going to die. And a lot if it felt forced. I did not have a problem understanding the story. I wasn't confused like dome said they were. Questions were left unanswered on purpose. The problem for me is I don't want to return for them. The movie was OK for a look but in the end, it just wasn't what it could've or should've been.",1340150400,5,1214,4.376106194690266

I can't believe that the creator of the original Alien would screw over the franchise like this. When John Carpenter prequeled The Thing last year, he tied it together to the original perfectly. Ridley Scott surprisingly was as far off base as one can get with his prequel to his original Alien. Gone are the face-huggers which have been the staple of the entire Alien franchise, & now replaced with the kraken, snakes, & a deadly virus!? WTF! Gaping holes are left between this & the original as Prometheus plays out, with the debacle finally concluding with an ending that could not possibly be any worse. The only consolation is the visual perfection that is present in all of Ridley's films.",1340150400,13,815,4.746478873239437

you DIDN'T expect. If this was predictable, then people would complain about that. Get real people. Trust Mr. Scott, and enjoy the ride!

I found myself wanting to go back and see Prometheus in the theater time and time again. It was just as good, even better, with every viewing.

Buying the movie when it comes out was just a no brainer. I love the film, and hope for a sequel, and even more entries in the Alien/Predator universe.

4798632,1,B005LAIHY0,"This is a prequal to alien, but it was so convoluted as to be rediculous. To get an alien you must:
1) Engineers had to create a race of creatures from their own DNA, ie Humans
2) Create a weapon of mass destruction that kills you, the Engineer, and apparently turns humans, with the same DNA profile, into crazed killing machines
3) Have android randomly poison a human with said weapon of mass destruction
4) The poisoned person must have sex with someone and get them pregnant
5) She must remove the bastard offspring (face hugger apparently)
6) Trick an Engineer into getting impregnated by massive face hugger(which grew 100's of times its original size in hours without food)
7) Aliens are born

WHAT THE HELL!? This was a fair scifi movie that was crammed into an existing universe.  This was worse than the Star Wars prequals.

None of the characters was fleshed out in any way past the character Arch types.  Android follows orders to the best of his ability and makes poor choices.  Rich old man wants to live forever. Rich old mans daughter wants him to die so she can take over. Scientist seeking answers that he doesnt end up liking.

Here are some questions to ask about the movie:
1-Why was the geologist, who mapped the structure, the one who got lost? Everyone else found their way out without any trouble.
2-Why would anyone take their helmets off on an alien planet, inside of an alien structure ever?
3-When lost, why would the Geoligist and random nice guy 1 stay in the chamber full of black flowing oozing liquid and then decide to play with the white snake creatures coming out of the black ooz? WHO THE HELL WOULD EVER DO THAT? ""OH ITS SO CUTE LOOK IT WANTS TO PLAY""
4-How was the Engineers head, from an alien dead for thousands of years, ""tricked"" into thinking it was alive. These were creatures with the same DNA profile as humans.
5-Why leave a map to your chemical weapon factory? A factory which was creating a weapon so deadly it literally broke apart your DNA as it killed you? WHY LEAVE A MAP TO THAT LOCATION? It makes no sense, as it was created to infect humans, apparently.
6-Why was 1 of only 12 autodoctors, things so rare and valueable few people have ever seen them, on the space ship at all, and why would it not be programed for females, and if it wasn't programmed for females, how the hell did it perform a emergency C-section to remove an ALIEN Facehugger?

The only alien seen was at the end, on an empty planet. That is how it ties into Alien.

This movie is horrible. Save your money and either get it from net flix/amazon as a rental or steal it from online.  I feel like they owe me $ 13 and 2 hours of my life back.",1339977600,35,2669,4.419551934826884
4798633,2,B005LAIHY0,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  First, Ridley Scott is top notch as a director.  Second, I love sci fi, especially scary sci fi. I generally like 3d as well.  So I went to see it in 3d.
Let's start with the 3d.  I think animated movies look the best in 3d.  Live action movies are rated by me as good, to poor. Avitar is the exception which I thought was great. I rate the 3d in Prometheus as fair.
The movie itself started out to make me think this was going to be really good.  Instead, as the movie dragged on, I found it boring most of the time.  Alien is a movie this is compared to.  There is no comparison.  Alien held my interest from beginning to end. This movie did not.  Maybe it's because there was too much reminiscent of Alien. For me, this wasn't very original.
For all the 5 star raters, I think you are very generous.",1339977600,4,847,4.109756097560975
4798634,4,B005LAIHY0,"Theatrical edition:
Prometheus got the story, visual effects, but it lacks action. I watched the first hour of the movie and I felt boredom. Then, almost at the end I got my desired action. Another disappointment is lack of aliens from other movies. I don't know whether it was good or bad. We saw the new species, but as the prequel to alien I expected to see at least one facehugger. I don't really see much connection between Xenomorphs and those aliens. Then, at the end I wanted to see the scientist travel to another planet. Those who watched the movie, know why she would travel on that planet, but still they could just give another 30 minutes to show exactly what would happen. Ending didn't satisfy me. There will be no second part to the movie, so I felt disappointed. Still, it isn't a waste of time, just a little boring movie. And last but not least, I knew there would a famous actress playing in Prometheus. I expected Angelina Jolie. But Charlize Theron was chosen and she was great! I really thought that this decision would suck. I was wrong. She was by far my favorite actress in the movie. Others played good, but I had no feelings to them.

Update:
I watched an extended edition (fan made) with the run time of 02:21:32. While the very beginning is boring, it was quite important to the plot itself. The theatrical edition features no xenomorphs, but in the extended edition there is a creature that is either a xenomorph or a pre-xenomorph. That moment was the only great moment in the whole movie. Only after seeing it, am I so much looking forward for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie.
While given extended cuts, we still weren't given everything and instead of adding the complete extended version together with theatrical version a fan of the movie had to manually put all parts together to make an extended edition himself. Unless you see the extended edition of the movie, you haven't really seen 'Prometheus'. We all know how much potential the movie's got, but extended edition is simply the best. I really want to see more special features and more deleted scenes put back in the official extended version. Also I hope the cast for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie is going to be different. I didn't like actors in this movie. Please get rid of the main surviving actress, like kill her in the early beginning of the second movie or just do anything.",1339977600,,2380,4.639810426540285
4798695,5,B005LAIHY0,"I was a little worried when I walked into the theater to see ""Prometheus"".  The stakes were high.  I'm an enormous fan of the Alien film series and the original is still my favorite (only by a narrow margin with the second though).  ""Alien"" was a Ridley Scott masterpiece.  It was dark, it was suspenseful, it was immersive, it was terrifying and launched one Ellen Ripley into the stuff of cinematic legend.  What would this new film, this mysterious ""pseudo"" prequel to Alien be like?  I had heard very mixed reviews and even outright thrashings of the movie.  Ridley Scott himself was reluctant to call it a true prequel and was very cryptic about what it was.  My hopes were firmly in check as I entered the theater.  Even if the reviews were bad, I still thought maybe there was hope.  Afterall, a lot of people hated ""Alien Resurrection""-and I thought that was a great film.  (I even enjoy the AVP movies on some level-even if they aren't ""real"" Alien movies.  I hope that doesn't destroy my credibility here)  :)

  I'm pleased to say that both myself and the buddy I was with LOVED Prometheus.  That being said, it was not at all what I expected.  Instead, it was something entirely unique.  In short, ""Prometheus"" was this strange new thing I discovered unlike any other film I have ever seen.  It was bold, it was gorgeous, it was thought provoking and it dared the audience to invest in it's odd mythos.  Plus, I never knew where the next crazy turn would take me.  There was just no way to predict what curveball would come next.  Hours, even days later after viewing it-I was still thinking back on it, trying to put pieces of it together, thinking about all of the elements and how the chain of circumstances came together to create the end result.  In today's age of disposable entertainment, where films are so easily forgettable the second the end credits roll-I found Prometheus to be a welcome disrupter to the flow.  It takes a special film for me to find myself repeatedly drawn back to it and drawn back to it I was.

  Prometheus is a haunting film.  Not just for the world that it creates and the bizarre events that unfold, but also for the intriguing and memorable characters it introduces (David anyone?) and for the stunning beauty of the film itself.  I did not see the film in 3D, but will probably see a follow up viewing in 3D because I'm curious about the possibilities of what the third dimension could add to the film.  Prometheus truly is the most beautifully shot film I have seen since.....well I can't even remember.  It's an absolute visual stunner on every level and easily the most immersive Science Fiction film I have seen since the original Alien.

  All of this being said, there were a few things I did not understand immediately following the film.  I will not go into them for fear of spoiling others, but the buddy I was with had a pretty strong theory on what the first few minutes of the film meant and also made a biblical correlation that I had missed completely.  (On both accounts I believe he was spot on).  The only major issue I had with Prometheus is a continuity problem with the original.  The way Prometheus ended did not line up for me.  In order for the Nostromo team to make their initial discovery in the original, events would have had to transpire a little differently than the way they did in Prometheus.  I don't quite understand that either since it seemed to me like like that particular plot hole would've been easy enough to fix.  I assume Ridley Scott knew what he was doing and I guess if you really want to get creative there are scenarios you could imagine where the two could possibly line up, but to me-it seemed like a gapping plot crater in an otherwise profound and thought provoking piece of Sci-Fi brilliance.  (Still loved the film though)  Prometheus is fairly open ended and even though I don't imagine there will be a sequel, I would absolutely love to see one made.  My hat's off to Ridley Scott and the writers for creating something so vastly unique.  That's really quite an accomplishment for a prequel (of sorts).",1339977600,7,4108,4.558139534883721
4798696,3,B005LAIHY0,"In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)

A pale-skinned ""god"" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.

So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - ""choosing to believe"" - which Shaw echoes.

On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Soul-of-Science-Christian-Faith-and-Natural-Philosophy-Turning-Point-Christian-Worldview-Series/dp/0891077669/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)</a>&nbsp;Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.

Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced ""faith"" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose ""1492"" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.

Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.

Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.

In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.

There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland ""Father"" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)

Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that ""sometimes to create you first have to destroy."" Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over (""A king dies ..."") and David seems to want his creators dead (""Doesn't everyone ...?"") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?

Or ... are we their creators? Wow.

Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoring the importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.

And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)

So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his ""twist"" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.

Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to ""In the Mountains of Madness"". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.

The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.

The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.

Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless. Fassbender's David is spellbinding, and is reason alone to enjoy this movie.",1339977600,35,5617,5.121311475409836
4798697,5,B005LAIHY0,"This review is for the film Prometheus (3D version).  The film gets a 9 out of 10 rating, and the 3D experience gets a 9.5 out of 10 rating.  The film was filmed in 3D (not post-converted) and it looks amazing. There aren't any artifacts that pop out at the viewer, but the depth within the environments is amazing.  Highly recommend watching the 3D version. I'll do a review of the Blu-ray set when I receive it.

As for the film, it was very enjoyable throughout. The reason for the 9 rating is because I felt like it was missing something.  The film was 2 hours long, and it feels like it should have been a two and half hour long film.  I think we needed more exposure with the ""engineers"", showing how they operated and even created the weapons contained in the urns.  I think we needed to get to know the crew better so we could feel more for them when certain members perish or are hurt.

The pacing of the film was excellent, never seemed to get boring, but I think certain scenes could have built up the suspense a little more.  The camera work was excellent, and the environments look amazing. The technology and visuals were impressive.

This film is in the same universe as Alien, but is not a direct prequel to Alien. It shouldn't be compared with Alien.  It's a different type of film as Alien, as was Aliens (Cameron's). Three unique films in the Alien universe.

Prometheus is definitely a science fiction film worth watching, especially if you enjoy the Alien universe (although I ignore the 3rd and 4th films). And if you are new to the Alien universe, definitely give this film a viewing.  But you should watch Alien (Ridley Scott), and Aliens (James Cameron) if you get the chance.",1339977600,5,1701,4.483766233766234
4798698,5,B005LAIHY0,"Other than the seemingly forced appearance by one of cinema's most famous monsters at the end, Prometheus is very much a film that stands on its own apart from the Alien universe . Sir Ridley Scott and co. I think were very wise in going toward a different direction for the franchise and to focus on the ""Engineers"" . As a result those like myself who is a big fan of the Alien movies are introduced to a much richer universe.
I am intrigued by the character of Dr. Shaw because she not only is a person of science but a person of faith as well and this dichotomy I think is the basis of her journey, which is the search for truth to humanity's origins. To me I think the true horror in this movie are not the horrible creatures that wreck havoc on the crew of the Prometheus but the revelation that the gods or God have forsaken their creations and even worse intend to destroy what they made(What if you found out that you were a mistake?). Dr. Shaw's discovery does not make her want to run back to Earth but instead drives her to find the source of the ""Engineers"" thus her journey continues for answers  and sets us up for a sequel which I certainly hope happens.
This is another winner from Ridley Scott. The cinematography is awe-inspiring. The art direction is superb. The effects enhance. The music by Marc Streitenfeld is channeling Vangelis (composer of Scott's Bladerunner and 1492).
The most thrilling scene of the movie is Dr. Shaw's self surgery to remove an unwanted embryo from her body. Definitely a keeper.
Michael Fassbender treats us to another great performance as the artificial man DAVID 8 who himself was engineered by humanity which introduces us to another potential dichotomy that can be explored in the sequel. He is definitely more interesting than most of the human crew. You can call him a HAL 9000 with legs.
As a film Prometheus truly stands apart from the rest of the Alien films. In fact the presence of the ""Alien"" or xenomorph in the film is almost questionable. If you remove that then the only thing that ties this movie to Alien are the ""Engineers"". So what we have here is really a spinoff which makes it all the more interesting for fans of the Alien universe. Highly recommended.",1339891200,17,2224,4.532338308457711
4798699,4,B005LAIHY0,"I hesitated about seeing ""Prometheus"" (123 min.) in 3D, but when I heard that the movie was in fact shot specifically with 3D cameras, I gave in and went to see it today in a 3D theatre. I'm glad I did. The 3D visuals are pretty much outstanding throughout, set in razor-sharp perspective. So yes, it is worth the extra couiple of dollars to see this in 3D, at least in the theatre. I have no idea how well the 3D version will translate to your TV screen.

As to the movie itself, while the story seemed a bit overly complicated at time, once the movie got rolling about 45 minutes into it, it was a non-stop riveting ride to the very end. At first I thought that Noomi ""Dragon Tattoo"" Rapace was miscast as Elizabeth Shaw, but I most surely changed my mind after seeing what she goes through in the second half of the movie, and in fact I think her performance stacks up well to Sigourney Weaver's. Michael Fassbender's performance as the human-like robot David is also worth mentioning.

A special mention must be made about the movie's outstanding visuals. It really felt as rich as say ""Avatar"". As I was watching the movie, I couln't help but think to myself, ""this sure looks like one heck of an expensive movie"". Curiosity got the better of me so I looked it up, and indeed the production costs alone (never mind the marketing costs) are estimated at $125 million. Amazing. Even though the movie's ending is left fairly wide open with a clear path for a ""prequel-sequel"", I don't know that the studio will even greenlight it, unless ""Prometheus"" is a big hit (which is not likely; I wash shocked how poorly attended the huge theatre was that I saw this in).

4798704,2,B005LAIHY0,"***This review may contain spoilers***

No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth.

Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').

Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!

Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.

Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clichd character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.

The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.

Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and he does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick!

It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).

It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?

Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies?

If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Promethesus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!",1339804800,13,5843,4.915821501014198
4798795,5,B005LAIHY0,"PROMETHEUS is a great triumph for Ridley Scott in many ways. Not only is the film absolutely stunning visually, but it has a very good story to back it up. It takes place years before the ill fated crew of the Nostromo ever make it to Zeta II Reticuli in 1979s ALIEN. You don't have to have seen ALIEN to really enjoy PROMETHEUS, but if you have, you will notice many cues from ALIEN that trascends into PROMETHEUS only making the film that much better for those of us that loved ALIEN. Alot of questions from the first film are answered in this one, but it also manages to raise a whole set of new ones! Over all, I can easily see PROMETHEUS being the #1 sifi film of 2012. The only drawback I can say about PROMETHEUS is having to wait so long for the Blu-Ray 3-D release is a real pain!! I cant wait to see it again.......AT HOME!!!",1339804800,9,835,4.192546583850931
4798796,2,B005LAIHY0,"Warning:  lots of spoilers in this.  First, the good:  Visually it looks very good, it is consistent visually with the franchise and the new alien worlds look cool & creepy.  Most of the acting is good, Michael Fassbender is particularly good in his role.  The Bad:  The actors don't have a whole heck of a lot to work with.  Most of the ""philosophy"" and ""concept"" of this movie is a watered-down version of themes from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner about what it means to be human and how creations (androids) view their creators.  The single biggest problem is that nothing -really- makes any sense when you think about it - and it feels like every scene characters are making decisions that no reasonable person in that situation would make.  It's also a very unintellectual movie - it champions Intelligent Design (Evolution is given lip service but the whole movie is about how humans were intelligently designed), and it is shockingly P.C. (I mean really, is she trying to deliver the alien baby or is she aborting it - if it's an abortion call it an abortion already, calling it a C-section is absurd).  The science is consistently ridiculous - whether it's carbon dating, DNA, surgical machines from the future that were only designed for procedures on males (when half the crew is female) or black goo magic none of it makes any sense.  All the aliens we've already seen before, including the ""new"" ones that look like the bad guys from Dark City or Pinhead without the Pins (not very original).  But it's the decisions the characters make that make the least sense, right up to the end where the main character somehow ""knows"" that the alien race that had sleepers on a mission to destroy the earth somehow ""changed"" its mind.  Is that just wishful thinking?  More likely the aliens thought their sleepers would do the job and had other priorities.  Going there to find out why they changed their mind presupposes that they did change their mind - and I must have missed where in the film she saw something that made her think that.  It surely wasn't the alien that tore her crew apart with his bare hands that suggested they changed their mind.  I think perhaps we're just supposed to look at cool visuals and not expect anything to make any sense.",1339804800,12,2268,4.644110275689223

all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a

worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only
complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little
unnecessary. This like so many other prequels though fall in to the strange aspect of the technology of movies makes it seem like they had cooler stuff in the beginning of the sagas then in the originals which is set in the future. I give it an A.",1339804800,7,1502,4.406474820143885
4798799,5,B005LAIHY0,"In 1979 ""Alien"" was part of the science fiction boom created by ""Star Wars."" Although ""Alien"" was essentially a horror movie in space, it adhered to the ""Star Wars"" philosophy of a ""used"" universe where everything is functional, it looks used and lived in as a deep space voyage would be. ""Alien"" also spawned several sequels (to varying degrees of success) and now ""Alien"" follows ""Star Wars"" into the land of prequels.

""Prometheus"" starts in the year 2089 when a pair of archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover the oldest cave paintings that depict giant aliens pointing to a star system they couldn't possibly have known about. The next thing we know the archeologists and team of scientists are off on a mission, paid for by the ultimately corrupt Weyland Corporation, to the mystery planet which turns out to be LV-426, here named LV-23. Although the planet isn't as inhospitable as it is in ""Alien"", they quickly discover a series of pyramids and set off to explore the nearest one (rather impetuously). They quickly discover alien  holograms that lead them to the fossilized remains of the alien seen in the spaceship in ""Alien"" and discover a room full of canisters and the statue of a head with very human like features. David (Michael Fassbinder), an android, soon demonstrates a propensity for carrying a secret agenda different from the stated goals of the mission In space you shouldn`t trust an android.

One of the mistakes sequels and prequels make is to try and remake the original movie by recycling scenes from the original and giving them a slightly different context. While ""Prometheus"" gives its fair share of nods and homage to ""Alien"" they're reimagined in ""Prometheus"" and the ""Alien"" reference or scene isn't dependent or redolent of ""Alien.""

There have been numerous comparisons between ""Prometheus"" and ""2001"" and parallels certainly exist. The most obvious is the introductory ""creation"" scene of life on earth which is the rough equivalent to the monolith in ""2001"" spurring the explosion of intelligence in the hominids. Michael Fassbinder as David is the HAL of the movie with a little Jude Law from ""A.I."" and Michael Rennie from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and perhaps a little David Bowie (although Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is referenced). The plots of ""Prometheus"" and ""2001"" are similar. The search for a higher intelligence, God, that created us and the search for answers although ""Prometheus"" is a film for the 21st century and has a darker vision of the future than the forward looking ""2001"" of the late 60's and 20th century did. There's even a scene towards the end that could qualify as the psychedelic scene at the end of ""2001"". Or is Guy Pearce as a corrupt industrialist doing an homage to Keir Dullea as the old man at the end of ""2001""?

Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" among others) gives us a movie with lush visuals and a panoramic scope (which I guess made for great viewing of the movie in 3-D), and the acting he gets from the cast is top notch. A special nod should be given to Charlize Theron as the ice queen commander of the ship, but she manages to interject a bit of humanity into the role and doesn't deserve the end she meets in the movie.

While there are some plot holes in the film and some that are instantly obvious, ignore them, there's more going on in this movie that holds your attention and as the story moves along. We become intrigued as to the origin and intentions of the giant aliens that drew the humans to the planet, as the ""Alien"" creature evolves, moving us and the story closer to the ""Alien"" we all know and enjoy.

It's a rare movie that I didn't want to see end and when it did end I wanted to see more.",1339804800,8,3787,4.746200607902735

The visuals are interesting, but the plot is confused, the screenplay is terrible, the acting is mediocre, and it's full of holes both in the plot and in the overall conceptualization of the story.  It's like a series of science fiction movie cliches strung together almost randomly.  The occasional allusions to issues of human origins and meaning do not add anything, they just make it sillier.  The best way to watch it would be to turn the sound off and enjoy the set designs.",1339804800,19,561,4.752577319587629
4798801,5,B005LAIHY0,"I find it ironic and perversely satisfying that ""Prometheus"" is getting such mixed reviews. Why? Because it only reinforces my opinion that this is some kind of great movie, to paraphrase an old friend. And furthermore, because this is EXACTLY what happens to director Ridley Scott when he makes science fiction films. Look back at some of the contemporaneous reviews of 1979's ""Alien"" and 1982's ""Blade Runner."" When you do, you'll find a lot of vitriol being directed at Scott by film critics.

One tired gripe, which is resurfacing with ""Prometheus,"" is that Scott puts the visuals ahead of the story. I think that is baloney. Yes, the visuals in ""Prometheus"" are astonishing, but science fiction MUST look good; it must astound us and fill us with wonder. Besides, the story here does have depth -- it's just that Scott, as always, is asking you, the viewer, to do some of the work. This is in the grand tradition of another filmmaker, by the way -- Stanley Kubrick, who directed ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And Scott has said in recent interviews that ""2001"" influenced ""Prometheus.""

I am not ready to say that ""Prometheus"" is in the same league as ""2001,"" which stands as one of the greatest movies of all time, science fiction or otherwise. But it shares some of the themes of ""2001,"" including the idea that some sort of alien presence manipulated things here on Earth so that humans would evolve into the dominant species. Also, ""Prometheus"" refuses to answer all the questions it poses, just as ""2001"" did. To me, that's the sign of great storytelling, whether the medium be film, novel or stage play.

I think ""Prometheus"" will -- as ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" did -- acquire more stature over time. Meanwhile, naysayers might want to note that as of December 8, 2012, the film has made more than $400 million worldwide, meaning it has recouped its cost, and then some. Clearly, the film is reaching a receptive audience.

In addition to its other strengths, the theatrical version of the film deployed some of the best and most subtle 3D visuals to date. I am happy to report that the Blu-ray 3D version looks every bit as good on my TV, despite the much smaller picture. The 4-disc edition (3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray special features, DVD/Digital Copy) contains seven hours of bonus materials.

I agree that ""Prometheus"" is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the picture clearly was written with a sequel in mind -- the ending practically screams the word ""sequel,"" to be honest. Back in the day, though -- I'm talking more than half a century ago -- one could go to the theater and see science fiction and other genre pieces presented in serial form.

Despite its flaws, ""Prometheus"" is a winner. Why? Because, in the end, it is greater than the sum of its parts. The holes in the story, the mediocre acting by some of the minor cast members, the occasional bit of silliness -- all of that can be forgiven, for this is a film that asks huge questions about who we are, how we began, and what we might become as a species. ""Prometheus,"" like its namesake, is overly ambitious, but I'd rather have that, any day of the week, in my movies, music and literature. Far better to aspire and fall slightly short than not to care at all.",1339804800,,3250,4.673076923076923

There's so many things I loved about this movie. But here's a summation of the most important bits.

a) Great casting. Everyone makes the most of their part. Noomi Rapace and David Fassbender are particularly absorbing to watch.

b) Visually stunning. It's just a really cool, unique and strange looking movie. Ridley Scott made some interesting choices.

c) Grand themes. There's some deep questions and fascinating ideas in this film's DNA. Some answers are given, but many are not. The sense of mystery and unknown that made alien/aliens so engaging is still here.

d) Thrilling. This film is intense. Once it gets going, it doesn't really let up. There's one scene in particular that is just twisted and there's several scenes that all but gave me a heart attack.

I am a huge Blade Runner fan though, and I think that this film is more in tune with that film than the aforementioned series. Gorgeous cinematography: unique and inventive shots one after another, edited with such style and lyricism, wonderful acting, etc. Prometheus is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction (perhaps art in general) ever conceived, and I think someday might be considered Scott's masterpiece.

4798885,5,B005LAIHY0,"For those interested in the 3D, foremost, Prometheus 3D was filmed with 3D cameras, not converted from a 2D source. The filmmakers did a splendid job with the parallax (3D layers) in most scenes, but don't search for pop out of the screen moments, as this isn't designed as such. Depth reaches far into the screen as would be expected with any 3D film.

The 3rd dimension surely gives this horror/sci fi film an extra layer of dimension, transporting you into the exploration of these scientists searching for the origin of the human species, as they so grimly discover. The plethora of gory horror moments are as real as they can get thanks to the well implemented and very effective 3D.

Does the 3D look as good as Avatar 3D? No, but it's a very pleasant 3D experience for sure, and a few good notches above most average quality 3D movies. There are scenes that really highlight the 3D, and most of the film conveys impressive 3D layers.

For the movie itself, if you enjoyed the original Alien, there is no reason you won't enjoy this patient but tense horror/sci fi film, fairly reminiscent of the original nightmare discovery of Weaver's crew in many aspects.

3D: Strong 3D throughout.
3D Parallax: Nicely done.

The film glosses over the philosophical questions it started off trying to answer, coming off as more of an existential mess.

I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, he's truly brilliant, so maybe my expectations for this film were too high.  Some of the Alien franchise movies are true classics, but that sadly won't be the case with this film.

Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.

The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.

The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my ""Alien"" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, ""Alien."" The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.

The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before ""Prometheus"" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.

The plot has holes, and doesn't take the series as a whole anywhere.

The atmosphere there isn't even breathable by Engineers, and they've had to create an artificial atmosphere in their facilities.

It is unclear why David infects Holloway with the black substance. If it's because Weyland wants to accelerate his plans, it is unclear why would anyone think the black material would extend anyone's life or speed up the meeting with the Engineers.

Sure, those questions could be answered, and the answers might have even been cut out in editing, but that brings up another point - the movie doesn't add anything to the other movies. The questions of where humans & the Aliens came from was never important in the other movies, just like the question where the Predators race came from.

As horrific as the Alien monster was, it was simply trying to survive and it just so happens it needed human hosts to gestate its young in. The simplicity of nature's savagery (and we have examples of such parasitism on earth) made ALIEN, together with stellar performances and effects, the great sci-fi-horror-drama it was. PROMETHEUS developed a convoluted, full of plot holes, preachy back story to the saga that just sucked the life out of the storyline....and shameful repetition of some of the events from ALIEN along the way to try and up the horror ante.

4798890,5,B005LAIHY0,"...I still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway.

First - let's get a major (or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews) spoiler out of the way.  This is NOT an Alien movie.

It is, however, set in the same universe.  Do you recall the ship on LV426 in the first Alien movie discovered by the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo?  Ever wonder who the other aliens were, the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well-preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come?

Ridley Scott answers those questions.  You may not like the answers, but the answers that Ridley Scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time.  Where did humanity come from?  Did we originate from elsewhere?  Does life exist elsewhere?  Do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else?  Two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other.

Ridley Scott doesn't usually make the same movie twice and if you're expecting a Blade Runner or Alien out of Prometheus, you will be sorely disappointed.  Prometheus (unlike the Nostromo) is lavishly appointed by its funder, Mr. Weyland, and features state-of-the-art navigation and equipment unlike the funded-for-blue-collar-workers' ship, the Nostromo.  Our crew is also well-equipped to map out the areas, although they do take questionable risks at times.

Even so, what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the Alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that Weyland-Yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise.

Yes, you'll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts, some lines are cliched, and it is also not a game-changer in the sci-fi genre, but what Ridley Scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation, environments, and scope of story.

This movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered, I hope that he's on board to continue the ride.",1339632000,10,2139,4.910863509749303
4798891,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his 1979 classic ""Alien,"" but PROMETHEUS is a very different type of picture: a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level.

Its ""Alien"" aspects - and there are some - are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from, how we got here, and where we're going. Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof's screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner that's positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters, opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on Earth at the dawn of time (shot in Iceland by Scott) and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late 21st century setting out to uncover the answers.

Among the crew of the ship ""Prometheus"" are scientists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, gruff captain Idris Elba, icy cold Weyland corporation exec Charlize Theron, and a curious android named David (Michael Fassbender), the work of the elderly Charles Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself, who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left ""calling cards"" on ancient cave paintings around the globe. Upon arriving on a desolate planet, Rapace and company find a dank, deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before - as well as a gooey chemical substance that's anything but benevolent.

It's easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight-ahead ""Alien"" prequel may be turned off by ""Prometheus"": this film isn't just a variation on its predecessor, with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster. Its brilliance is due to Scott's blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line that's deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for. Granted, there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are - especially in a mid-section that seems a bit rushed - but what's left unanswered aren't so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate. It may be less accessible to the masses than ""Alien"" but it's also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what it's attempting to do and say.

Rapace's sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard, giving her character an emotional vulnerability that's wholly sympathetic - not just a Ripley clone, her Elizabeth Shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would-be Gods are trying to destroy them. Shaw's unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in, as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious David, whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from Fassbender.

Scott's penchant for amazing visuals are, of course, on-hand throughout the film, and there are a handful of dynamic set-pieces: a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing ""medical"" sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale. The director said in pre-publicity that he wanted ""Prometheus"" to be ""big"" and the film is indeed that, both in the messages it develops and the visuals on-screen. Spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of H.R. Giger, giving fans a taste of the universe that Scott first brought to the screen with ""Alien"" but here in a very different context. (In fact, if there's a moment that feels somewhat out of step here, it's in a quote from Jerry Goldsmith's unused main title from ""Alien"" that comes across as unnecessarily shoe-horned into the picture).

Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and even the score, credited to Marc Streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by Harry Gregson-Williams that's used throughout the picture (so much that it's surprising he only received an ""Additional Music"" credit), are likewise effective: this is a film that's filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci-fi fans returning to ""Prometheus"" for some time to come, both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design.

Throughout his career, Ridley Scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery: not just in his classics like ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" but also in the commercial failures of ""Legend,"" ""1492"" and ""White Squall."" Throughout them all, Scott has brought the beauty of nature and, indeed, different worlds and even whole universes to life, very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas. While not without its flaws, ""Prometheus"" ranks not only with those films visually, but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of Scott's works, as well as an emotional range that's particularly surprising at its conclusion. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, a film that entertains and engages, a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more.",1339632000,23,5214,5.055813953488372
4798892,1,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's first three films - The Duellists, Alien, and Blade Runner - established his reputation as one of the most fascinating directors of his time.  His intricate visual style, which he called ""layering,"" drew comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's work.  But the comparison was not apt; whereas Kubrick wanted his visuals to serve his highly personal intellectual themes, Scott never strayed too far from his roots as a director of commercials.  Scott always looks for arresting images which will indelibly remain in the viewer's memory long afterwards.  He's not a great storyteller, not a big ""idea man,"" and has marked impatience (as anyone who knows the story behind Blade Runner knows) for those who are.

Prometheus is a collection of arresting images and scenes which - when considered as a story - don't amount to much.  The writer - a frequent JJ Abrams collaborator who helped turned Star Trek into execrement in 2008 - met his usual qualitative standards here.  Whereas Alien was notorious for one gruesome scene, Prometheus spends its final hour on a flesh-defiling parade of bodily penetrations and mutations.  In his youth, Scott bragged about his sense of restraint in Alien; he claimed that most of the horror in that film was inferred.  The septagenarian Scott could learn a thing from that young man.  Some vestiges of the good visualist remain; the harsh beauty of Iceland's lava fields serves as both primordial Earth and planet LV-whatever.  If Scott settled for an IMAX film about that beauty - or showed some semblence of good taste during the latter stages of the film - it wouldn't have felt as if one of his snake-like uglies slithered in and picked my pocket.  Instead, Scott conducted a symphony of pus and slime in an abatoir.  Perhaps in anticipation of what's to come, the space travelers find themselves retching as soon as they emerge from cryogenic sleep.

The themes - such as they are - are displeasing too.  An extra-terrestrial source of humanity has been done before in science fiction - most notably in Kubrick's 2001 - and done better.  It seems that Prometheus' writer was watching an old episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation (""The Chase"") while working on his drafts.  Even the progenitor seen on TV looks suspiciously familar.  Prometheus is somehow sillier than this source material though, evoking memories of Erich Von Daniken's book Chariots of the Gods.  In that popular early seventies work, every exotic feature of an ancient statue or building was seen as evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation.  Though the protagonists of Prometheus are scientists, this film not only feels pseudo-scientific (we've come to expect that in sci-fi cinema), it actually feels anti-scientific.  It's not that Scott can't be bothered to get things right, it's that he would rather be wrong.  In a nod to changing audience demographics, Scott makes his heroine a Christian-scientist too.  It makes one think of Charlton Heston's rebuke of his antagonist in 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" in which he sees a fundamental contradiction between his opponent's joint-role as both Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith.

There's also a clumsy misstep here; it's always a mistake for a bad film to refer to a good one.  Scenes from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are played here, including some choice lines.  It starkly reminds viewers of how far cinema has sunk since those glorious days, as well as how their time could be better employed.

But Scott is right about one thing; his images are indelible.  I sympathize with victims in the Aliens films, always pleading: ""Get it out, get it out!"" and ultimately: ""Kill me!""",1339632000,83,3653,5.003311258278146
4798893,4,B005LAIHY0,"(SPOILERS Ahead) ""Prometheus"" is quite an entertaining movie with stunning visuals but has a plot that will leave you stumped if you are not paying attention or do not think things through. The acting is quite entertaining. The movie, while not specifically a prequel of the ""Alien"" movie, definitely has elements that clearly tie it in to that movie. If you go into ""Prometheus"" expecting to have everything laid out for you, you will be sorely disappointed; this is not ""Transformers"" - expect to have to take the information given and cogitate. For example, one character, after arriving at the planet and exploring the ""mound"", becomes quite drunk and morose. Well, you have to realize that his dream of actually meeting one of the aliens had been dashed - what was to be his greatest achievement of his life had just been utterly destroyed. How would you respond if your dreams were dashed to pieces? Another example is David's poisoning of the aforementioned drunk. You have to listen to the conversation that occurred between them: ""What would you do to realize your dream?"" ""Anything and everything"" ""Exactly"" (or sentiments to that effect). Couple that with David's objectives and it becomes quite clear why he did what he did.

If you are looking for mindless entertainment, turn to ""Transformers"" and other movies of that ilk. This is not one of those movies. Both ""Transformers"" and ""Prometheus"" are good movies, but for very, very different reasons. If you are looking for a movie that will make you think, and has stunning visuals to boot, this quite easily could be a movie up your alley.",1339632000,42,1603,4.893382352941177
4798894,4,B005LAIHY0,"The 1979 film ALIEN took the modern-day lead in alien invasion and/or possession movies with some fairly gruesome special effects (remember the alien bursting through John Hurt's chest?), and making it so that any film of this sort more or less has had to utilize those same methods from that point on, with the most noticeable example being John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING.  And now, in a new century, thirty-three years after that huge box office achievement, ALIEN (and BLADE RUNNER) director Ridley Scott has returned to this theme with PROMETHEUS.

Named for the Greek god who stole and gave the gift of fire and was cast out from Mount Olympus, the spaceship ""Prometheus"" and her crew are venturing through the galaxy to find the origins of the strange lights in the sky that ancient Earth civilizations, including the Egyptians and the Mayans, reputedly saw some thirty-five thousand years before--an idea floated around by theologian Erich von Daniken.  When they arrive on a planet hundreds of billions of miles from Earth, they find evidence of this in a huge hollow mountain on the surface.  Unfortunately, what they also find is that this alien presence is extremely hostile; and one by one, they die very horrible deaths.  In between, they come to realize that these aliens are actually intent on hitching a ride on ""Prometheus"" and coming to Earth in order to either destroy or possess every living human being there.  In doing so, they have to sacrifice themselves, often in the most horrible ways; and in the end, one of the female crew members (Noomi Repace), who had initially been infected and impregnated by one of the alien beings, manages to escape the planet in one of the various spaceships left over from the alien race.  But there's something she doesn't know yet....

Although he had done some impressive work following BLADE RUNNER, including GLADIATOR, BLACK HAWK DOWN, BLACK RAIN, and 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE, Scott had been basically been overshadowed by his younger brother Tony, who co-produced PROMETHEUS with him, David Giler, and Walter Hill (the last two the original co-producers of ALIEN), and had upped the hyper-directional stakes with 2004's MAN ON FIRE and the 2009 reworking of 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.  In essence, Ridley was going back to the basic premise of ALIEN, so much to the point that it could be argued that basically PROMETHEUS itself is a basic reworking of ALIEN, with a ""Chariots Of The Gods"" plot thrown in, and some up-to-date and extremely graphic alien special effects.  The crew of ""Prometheus"" here is far less well known than the cast that comprised the crew of ""Nostromo"" in ALIEN; only Charlize Theron, who had won an Oscar in 2003 for portraying a serial killer in MONSTER, and Guy Pearce, who was in the 1997 film noir hit L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, have any real ""name value."" As a result, whatever success PROMETHEUS can claim, though it is substantial, must rest on how well the entire cast, the gruesome plot, and Scott's direction hold up under very close scrutiny.  In general, Scott is a fairly classical director, relying more on what he learned from masters like Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles than his younger brother, who has taken the MTV ""splinters to the brain"" style of direction to new highs and lows, this in spite of the many special visual effects, and the many ultra-gory make-up effects sequences as well.

Given how many dozens of alien invasion movies there have been since he made ALIEN, one wouldn't understand what more Scott could do to make PROMETHEUS really stand out.  And in truth, he really doesn't.  But the one thing he does different from most alien invasion films is that he is given a good plot outline from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (based on unused elements from the original Dan O'Bannon/Ronald Shusett script for ALIEN), a good cast, and credible production values, the kind that somehow seem to fly out the window in most blockbuster films because of the need to concentrate on spectacle.  Therefore, despite some imperfections and a lot of gruesomeness, PROMETHEUS succeeds better than most others of its kind today.",1339632000,10,4154,4.92274678111588
4799004,2,B005LAIHY0,"Well, as you should have gathered by now, this a prequel to Alien/s. With that said, it was more a very try-hard effort to try and inter grate the two together, meaning, it's really only the end of the movie that kind of ties it... it's like it was either meant to be an unsuspected surprise, but with every critic already telling you it's confirmed it is a prequel, that surprise has been blown away, and the ending it self looked like it was included at last minute.

The story is probably what you expect from seeing trailers. In 2090 or so, a couple of archeologists/explorers find a cave in Scotland with some ancient paintings on the wall that show a star system. Putting two and two together, they link this start system to a bunch of other ancient drawings from around the world and luckily have the technology to head towards those stars in hopes of discovering where mankind evolved from. When they get there, they find it has a moon orbiting a planet that has an atmosphere that is not quite breathable to humans, but it most likely is the planet they have come to explore. They land on the planet and discover a bunch of structures that they decide to go into and blah blah blah blah... outbreak.

The characters of the movie aren't so much the reason I didn't enjoy this film. For the most part, every actor did a decent job in being a believable character. All but two actors. One being the old man who has terrible make-up, and the other being whats-his-face who played a robot (that guy from X-men First Class as Magneto) despite the bad make up of one, both characters seemed very dry and make you beleive they are planning something very sinister only to be killed off in seconds when their time comes (Well, the Robot guy doesn't die, but still), which left me thinking, ""what was the point of all that crap building up to this then?""

The other thing that brought the whole thing down was the pace. It was too slow, and focused too much on creating a CGI environment and wasting time with pointless character interactions that lead to nothing. An example of that would be the Charlize Theron's role of being something of a dull and lifeless military woman who you wonder if she is human or not, but by the end of the movie, you realize, it wasn't leading up to something with her useless scenes of showing she is heartless, no, it was just a terrible role, much like the other guy who played Magneto.. whatever his name is... dull, lifeless, almost completely pointless.

If only Elvis was around to tell Riddley Scott that he needs a little less conversation and a lot more action, then there might have been a decent flick here, but instead, it did the cheap thing it was most likely written for, to get Alien fans to hear it's a prequel, then suck them into any old rubbish, and end it on a note that there will be a sequel to this prequel.... and I won't be wasting my time with it if it does.",1339632000,9,2917,4.41635687732342
4799005,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ok this film isn't James Cameron's Titanic but it's pretty damn good. The characters played by Michael Fassbender and Charlize theron were particularly well played. I think alot of people were maybe hoping to have more of the Alien monster in this film. It's not so much about the Alien monster but about where do we come from? It also touched on our origins, being from God and the Cyborg having a soul and can it ever feel or want to live. If you're looking for this film to answer these questions you will be disappointed, i thought part of what was good about this film was that it asked the questions. If you're just looking for another Alien movie you'll be disappointed, if you're looking for something more you might be pleasantly surprised.",1339632000,8,749,4.597014925373134
4799006,5,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre has produced a beautiful and thought provoking film. I found Prometheus to be one of the summers best and one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen. The cast delivers superb performances especially in the cases of Fassabender and Rapace. Scott has delivered stunning visuals, and has created a believable universe that is rich in mythology. I would warn viewers to not expect an Alien movie. This film while a prequel is it's own self contained story and only subtle hints at the events of Alien. I believe many were expecting a straight forward prequel and the lack of connections to Alien is one of the primary reasons for all the negative reviews of the film. To be fair, while the film is a great movie, it is not perfect. The film suffers from obvious cuts to the story and these are most prevalent during the film's third act. I am hopeful that the extended cut that will be released on DVD  will help to answer many of the films unanswered questions. Despite the film's flaws Scott delivers a stunning and dark world that fits comfortably in with the Alien Saga. I hope Scott returns to do the promised sequel.",1339545600,8,1159,4.572115384615385
4799007,3,B005LAIHY0,"It seems that most of the reviews are pretty divided on this film. Some praising it as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever and others calling it one of the worst films ever. It is neither of those, it is simply meh. And, coming from a visual master like Sir Ridley Scott, that is sadly a bit of a dissapointment. I can't blame him for this as it may have been the writers but ultimately it's his movie, he signed off on it. I'll try to avoid spoilers in this review, although if you've seen most of the trailers for the film then you've already sadly been exposed to some key plot points that ultimately (for me at least) ruined the movie quite a bit. I really wanted to like this movie but it was painfully average with the plot and characters. Anyways on to the review.

As to the whole Alien prequel thing if you've read any interviews about the film Sir Scott says this isn't a prequel and he's right. It's set in the same universe as Alien with space Jockey's and the Weyland Yutani corporation but that's about it. It's unclear exactly when the start of the film takes place but it's considerably earlier than the rest of the narrative. Again I won't spoil anything. The movie then picks up in the late 2080's as scientists discover ancient paintings in a cave in Scotland of people worshipping a larger god-like creature beholding stars. We then flash forward a few years to the ship Prometheus flying through space to an undisclosed location where we're introduced to David, the ship's android, who monitors the crew while in cryo-sleep or whatever. The crew arrives at their planet of destination, woken up, briefed on the mission, and then make their fateful trip to the surface where they find ancient alien ruins and chaos ensues. I won't ruin anything further but just get into my pros and cons.

First of all the movie's beautifully shot and the special effects look great. It doesn't really look phony at all, the creature effects look like they captured these things and filmed them. People complained about the pacing of the film and it moves fine. It kind of stutters in the middle but it's constantly moving forward. Noomi Rapace does a great job as one of the lead scientists and Michael Fassbender did a good job as David. I also like how they try to address religious aspects although they never fully delve into it - it's just kinda there.

Now on to the negatives. Some of the characters and plot points just didn't make sense. For the characters there's a geologist who gets into a slight tiff with a biologist early on and says he's only in this for the money. Really? You're a geologist, doing assumably what you love, and you're only doing it for the money? Makes zero sense to me. Also why are the scientists waking up, meeting each other for the first time and then briefed above the planet - wouldn't it have made more sense doing all the meet and greet prep work before you left Earth? The android David's motives are all over the place. Characters in the movie just happen to know things. Like the two scientists at the beginning explaining that the reason the Prometheus is out in the galaxy is trying to track down ""Engineers"" instead of little green men. How could they have possibly known these beings were engineers that supposedly created human life? Where in any of the cave paintings did it show these creatures creating mankind? Unless this was footage that was cut, and if so it had better be restored to clarify that. Also - how did primitive humans know about these engineers to paint them on cave walls? Were they visited by them on and off throughout time? Also the captain of Prometheus makes a statement about what the alien ruins actually are - again, how does he know that? To me, as a viewer, the place seems more like a biological freakshow/zoo with various types of creatures but he comes to a conclusion somehow. It later shows him to be right but at the earlier point how did he know that? Also the movie fills a nice plothole by having holographic recordings of the Engineers in their last moments. This conveniently helps the David character understand the workings of the ruins. Were these holograms supposed to be a security camera system or a black box of some sort? Again - just seemed way too convenient to help the plot move along. Also the musical score was pretty generic. It's not like Goldsmith's original Alien score which was eerie and fit the atmosphere perfectly, this one's just kinda there. Also part of the end completely rips-off the original Alien movie which I felt wasn't necessary.

Anyways never trust a critic - see it yourself. I'd recommend seeing it in the theater if you can to truly appreciate Sir Ridley's cinematography and framing of shots. It'll look great on a big screen at home but that can't compare to the theater. Arguably Ridley still has the best eye for films. Just don't expect this to be a masterpiece like Blade Runner or Alien.

4799008,1,B005LAIHY0,"I watched this movie with high hopes thinking it's been around 30 years since the Alien movies so this movie would have a better plot. Forget about it. It's the same old, stupid sci fi horror flick. In face it's almost identical to Alien with a human robot. The very first scene when the captain is introduced, he's puffing smoke (Philip Morris product placement=$20mil), then comes the rugged, Mohawk hair cut-ed idiots under the title ""scientists"" (remember Bill Paxton in Alien?), then comes the bad weather and some get stranded in the structure, then comes the snake looking creatures with a bunch of teeth for a mouth (how does organic life survives in isolation for centuries? ---exactly. No imagination), then comes the idiotic ulterior motives (we traveled a gazillion miles to betray you--what?), then comes...it's just stupid.
The ending is even more idiotic. Let's carry a kamikaze attack by ramming this spaceship into the alien craft to prevent it from traveling to earth (ah, wouldn't earth have a better defense system to stop it? After all it is the 22nd century AND sound waves travel at the speed of light--send a warning to earth).
My recommendation is to pass on this one. Unless you're into idiotic, no imagination sci fi flicks.",1339545600,16,1251,4.9336492890995265

This movie really answered nothing. Though I'm not sure it was supposed to. Having said that, anyone that tries to say that ""this is not a prequel"" or ""this has NOTHING to do with the original Alien movie"" are dumber than a box of rocks.

But that's not even my problem. The writing was aimless and awful. The ""big scenes"" were discarded like a used tissue. Like the C-section scene and the betrayal that led to that scene were all but forgotten with a ""sorry about that"". The only thing that reminded you that happened was that Shaw kept having a tummy ache, but somehow survived.

The stupidity of the crew seeing a missing team member show up with a new monster, hairy face and ""sitting"" outside in an awesome, alien yoga pose was unbelievable. They just stood there looking dumbfounded before they were, justifiably, killed. What was the point of that scene anyway?

David's directive was hinted at but then discarded, even though Fassbender was great in the role. Vickers (Theron) was the biggest waste in this movie. Her anger, fear and motivation are never, ever explored. She is completely useless in this movie. She just screwed the ship's captain so... that's... good.

4799010,3,B005LAIHY0,"A couple of days ago I read a review of Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"", and the film critic's biggest complaint appeared to be that he found the film to be very confusing.  First of all, I'd like hear what this critic has to say about one of David Lynch's films; if he was addled by ""Prometheus"" then ""Mulholland Drive"" must've had him scurrying for the exit.  Because, while there are surely complaints to be made about Scott's nominal ""Alien"" prequel, confusing it is not.

In the year 2089, while exploring caves in the cliffs on Scotland's Isle of Skye, a pair of archaeologist/lovers (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) discover an ancient ""star map"".  Soon enough, they realize that the location of the stars in the image matches up EXACTLY with similar drawings from other ancient cultures.  Four years later, the sinister Weyland Corporation is jetting the pair, along with a complete crew--mostly self-serving and unlikable types--to a distant planet that may be home to humanity's creator(s).  The starship is named Prometheus and its occupants include corporate bigwig, Meredith, an Ice Queen (Charlize Theron) who is too-obviously up to no good (or is she?); Michael Fassbender's David, both devilishly good-looking and just devilish as the corporate android with several agendas; and Janek (Idris Elba) the ship's stalwart captain, who is probably the most sensible one of the bunch.

Once on the planet, the explorers find themselves in a series of interconnected caves that turn out not to be caves at all; they also find that they are not alone.  There are several different species of creatures, one, our ""creators"", not even indigenous to this particular planet.  There are some spooky scenes, too, although none come close to the claustrophobic terror of Scott's original ""Alien"".  When one of the female members of the mission suddenly finds herself (impossibly) pregnant and graphically aborts the ""fetus"", it's somehow reminiscent of that dinner table scene in ""Alien"" when the creature bursts out of John Hurt's chest.  It's a queasy, disturbing scene that stays with you.

Noomi Rapace, so captivating in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and its sequels, is completely believable as archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw, wearing her conflicting emotions like a Kabuki mask, her shell-shocked victim eventually giving way to Ripley-like heroics.  As her other half, Logan Marshall-Green--looking more like a male fashion model than a seasoned archaeologist (not necessarily a complaint)--is also heroic, yet much more vulnerable than Rapace; when he says he wants to ""meet his maker"", he gets more than he bargains for.  Charlize Theron uses her blonde, athletic good looks in the same way that Michael Fassbender uses his--both seem like androids but only one truly has that distinction, and both are dripping with malevolence--but I think that Fassbender gives the better performance.  In fact, considering that he's playing a robot, Fassbender arguably gives the best performance in the film.  The rest of the cast aquit themselves nicely, but some seem like stock characters spouting stock dialogue and doing various stock things until it's time for their characters to get killed off.

Above all, the special effects in ""Prometheus"" are wondrous; the team who created the ships, and this world with its strange and dangerous beings, are true artists.  The musical score, by Marc Streitenfeld, is portentuous and exciting, and there is a sleek sexiness to the costumes worn by most of the characters that would be equally appropriate for a superhero movie.

The movie questions the morality of creating life only to later seek to destroy it, assuming that alien beings would have the same sense of morality as humans.  It also presents searching for our origins in space as an elusive task, at best, one that is pursued at considerable peril, and with an almost certainty of deadly consequences.  Director Ridley Scott asks these questions, answering some and apparently deferring others for a presumed sequel.  At no time during the film are our ""creators"" (designated The Engineers) presented as benevolent beings dedicated to anything other than their own shady and violent enterprises.  Scott and his writers seem to be trying to create a new mythology here, and while there is an air of mystery, I'm not sure it's enough to sustain a whole new franchise, much less reboot the ailing ""Alien"" franchise.

Unfortunately, Ridley Scott falls prey to the new bells and whistles available to him with the new technology that litters this film. Between the blue screen landscapes and interiors and the overlaid holographic computer screens, the characters and story play third fiddle while Prometheus burns a cold, sterile flame. To be fair to Scott, he is not the only filmmaker who allows his work to be leadened by such technology, but one would have hoped that a filmmaker of his stature and reputation would have dialed down the periphery details and focused on the elements of story and character that could have elevated this to a great science fiction film.

4799136,3,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" is visually breathtaking, with a number of spectacular special effects, which would be even more breathtaking in 3D. It boasts two very talented actresses: Noomi Rapace, Lispeth Salander in the Millenium Trilogy, and Charlize Theron.  Viewers will recognize the alien spaceship, the command chair, and helmeted alien from the first Alien movie. The story, however, suffers from any number of ambiguities. I will accept a certain number of ambiguities, but the motivations of the characters should be reasonably understandable.  Kubrick achieved this in his masterpiece, ""2001, a Space Odyssey"". In that film, the meaning of the monolith and the Louis XVI bedroom are left to the viewer's imagination, but there was never any doubt about the character's motivations. In ""Prometheus"", what was the significance of the opening scene in which a character consumes some liquid, undergoes physical changes, and dies? What was his motivation? Why did the android put his finger with a drop of oily-looking fluid in the man's drink? What did he know? How did the crew come to understand so quickly that the canisters on the alien spaceship were WMD's targeted for earth? How did Dr. Shaw believe that the aliens had decided not to annihilate the the earth? One may infer that they all knew something, but whatever it was, I must have missed it. On other hand, this seems to have been the most intellectually challenged crews in the history of the genre.  A self-important creature feature.",1339545600,6,1494,5.139917695473251

Coming from a guy who went to see the first Alien film in the theater, to seeing it to many times to count afterwards. Wanting to try to figure out all the ambiguities of that film, & it was very ambiguous, with no clues about the xenomorph & the alien spaceship, & where they came from. So, all I have to say about ""Prometheus"" is, without giving it all away:

Genius, pure, genius! It answered all my questions about the first film, then some! It also created more ambiguities, but that's the charm of many great films, leaving the viewer wanting more. Just like life, there is never no complete answers on where you'll be tomorrow, what will happen to you after you die, or who is responsible for life on the grand scale. So goes ""Prometheus,"" for it can't answer those questions either, but it does make you wonder.

A new chapter has been born, one that leaves room for other, maybe more intriquing chapters to come, full of more ambiguous questions for the next film to explain?

Quite the accomplishment, Mr. Scott!",1339545600,9,1055,4.536842105263158

The creatures are really retarded looking & just appear with no rhyme or reason. And it has nothing to do with the Alien franchise. The only reason it's getting good reviews is because they stuck the Space Jockey from ALIEN in it to trick Alien fans into thinking it has something to do with Alien.

4799140,4,B005LAIHY0,"I'm a big fan of Alien and Aliens, thought Alien 3 was decent at best and really hated Resurrection, so with Ridley Scott taking us back to the start of the series, Prometheus was one of the top films I was looking forward to in 2012.

The plot is mostly about the creation of life on Earth and where we came from. The events take place about 30 years before Ripley and her crew land on a neighboring planet, where they find the same huge alien species that suffered the same fate here. Yes it is confusing at times (hence the four star rating), but I did manage to have most of my questions answered on that one big movie site (ya know the one). It does tarnish the mystery element of the Space Jockey from the first film, but I didn't think it took away anything from the series either. Maybe it didn't reach my high expectations as a whole, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

The acting from Noomi Rapace (the new Ripley, or is it the old?) and Michael Fassbender (the new Ash/Bishop android) stole the show. Both were very convincing. Charlize Theron also added quite a bit as well.

The IMAX 3-D visuals were clear and impressive. None of the CGI looked bad...well the last minute or so could have been less blurry. You'll know the iconic moment when you see it.

I read that Ridley Scott said he will be releasing the Blu-ray with 20 extra minutes. Like Kingdom of Heaven, I think this will elevate the movie even farther than this shorter cut.

Smart, beautiful, intense and full of questions to ponder over long after you have left the theater, Prometheus is one of the strongest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a long time.",1339459200,13,1636,4.3861386138613865

4799142,1,B005LAIHY0,"'Prometheus' SUCKED; no pun intended. I've always been a huge Ridley Scott fan since first witnessing the excitably horrible vision he created with 'Alien;' then the amazingly rendered world of 'Blade Runner' set the tone for the standard of cinematic quality I came to expect from Hollywood throughout the years. But sadly, the Talented Mr. Scott has performed grossly under-par; so far from his own professional standard and what fans who have followed his career throughout the years have come to expect. I do give him credit for taking a huge career risk by attempting to tackle the quandry of questions so expertly divuldged in 'Alien' some 30-odd years ago; but alas, and sadly, it was a dissapointingly failed effort. I've come to the solid conclusion that Mr. Scott is no longer 'hungry' in the way that ambitiously drove him to create the aformentioned efforts mentioned at the beginning of this regrettable review. It seems that after watching the over-hyped half-effort that is 'Prometheus,' he has even lost some respect for the process of giving proper attention to his craft; as if he knows it better than it knows itself. A seeming bit of arrogance and short-sightedness in thinking he is vastly more 'enlightened' than the rest of us dolts seems apperent in his lack of detail to filmmaking basics. Here is where the entire problem with this film lies with me. The most frustrating thing about this film for me to have sat for more than two hours through and witness, was the many technical, behind-the-camera, post-production errors throughout the it (yes, I'm calling it that, sadly in this case). I won't say here what they are, as there are many who have not yet seen it; but the flaws, as well as the uninspired, incoherent, and inconsistant script (or what suffices to pass as a plot). Everything was just so uneven; such a truly sad thing to witness considering the acting talent that was comprised to help pull this effort off (for Guy Pierce in particular; he endured the kind of effort movie magic would've presented over 20 years ago; nothing anyone would expect to see on the silver screen in 2012). To help recover from the gross taste left in my mouth by the wasted two hours of my life watching this movie that I'll never get back, I went home and watched 'Underworld: Awakening' (yes, I did; at least it managed to follow it's plot points better than Mr. Scotts' 'Promethus'), and that very much did the trick. I hope, as time goes on, that people realize the 'Willow' that this film is, nad that Hollywood puts the 'Alien' franchise (if they never intend to do it right) to rest for quite some time to come. Though it hurts me to do so, I htink there will be some out there who will understand the 'one star' I'm this film, as based on the sad, real, dissapointment this experience was for me to have to endure. As a result of witnessing the mish-mash that is 'Prometheus,' I will in no way remotely consider the thouhgt of daring to experience the potential mess that will be his Blade Runner reimagining.",1339459200,12,3039,4.703564727954972
4799143,5,B005LAIHY0,"When I heard that Ridley Scott was doing a prequel to his original Alien, I knew that I would not be disappointed.  What a great film this was regarding the epic story which fits in very well within the Alien universe.  The actors did an amazing job with the characters they portrayed, they give off a very convincing performance which makes you care about what happens to them.  The 3-D effects were the best that I have ever seen.  Usually I don't like 3D in movies, but paying a little extra for the 3-D in Prometheus was well worth it.  Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing regarding the likable characters, epic story, and grand scale of effects which makes this film a classic.  I don't understand why some people nitpick every little detail in this movie. It's a great film/Alien prequel and I highly recommend that you see it.",1339459200,17,840,4.529801324503311
4799234,5,B005LAIHY0,"I think people have this propensity to pick apart and complain about every minute and somewhat insignificant plot detail that doesn't spell out exactly what they are seeing, while simultaneously failing to see the overall picture and vision. This movie answered some big questions in my mind that began with Alien, if not in exact detail, they were eluded to enough to hopefully get the bigger picture if and when a sequel is filmed. I think in part that was the point, to begin to uncover some of the answers, but allow more questions to be answered in the future. Maybe some won't, who knows. Either way, I had the opposite reaction of people who didn't like it, where I was totally pulled into the fllm and from start to end tried to make connections to start to piece together the entire story. From Prometheus you realize the Alien story is more epic than you would have imagined, and I hope it will continue because it has taken the story in a new direction similar to what the new Star Trek did for that series. Alient 3 and 4 were watchable, but kind of ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. I'd rather watch A v P. People who don't like this movie might have also thought Avatar or Independence Day were great sci-fi films. Wait.. I'm getting a flashback; Will Smith punching out a huge alien and not breaking his frail hand on it's massive helmet, Bill Pullman's here comes America to save the world again speech, and Avatar's high school-like, over-emotional chosen one alien love story. Hut hut... hike! Ugh. Maybe I would have liked Avatar better if I hadn't seen it in 3d. Those glasses are terrible, and then when I took them off because I couldn't stand keeping them on my face, I realized they should probably come with a free packet of dramamine. Anyway. I'd say if you like darker, more 'realistic' sci-fi movies like Pandorum, Moon, The Thing ('82), or the original Alien/Aliens then you'll love this. I saw a comment about there being a bunch of insignificant people on the team which created weak characters - I think this was true of Aliens, where the marine team was larger until the core 'team' went into the installation and you care that they made it or not. In another comment someone said they didn't care at all about the main characters, but in Alien there wasn't a lot of backstory given about each person either. Prometheus was a different story with different characters, some of which you weren't supposed to like. I personally thought it was a great movie that if given a chance, will ignite the imagination, and at the same time loosely tie together the Alien/Aliens movies. Its 'message', if there is one, is much deeper and more haunting than the average sci-fi charater-undeveloped effect-fest that works well for the person that searches for the true answers to understanding the universe, whatever they may be. If you are bored easily, love the new Transformers movies because they move real fast without time to agitate the ol' ADD even though the dialog completely sucks, then you'll be disappointed. If you like sci-fi and are a fan of Alien/Aliens then watch this movie, it has a brain and the effects are amazing.

Most of the characters were unlikable and, as with most Ridley Scott films, the tone was very cold.  I was a bit unclear on the motivations of the Michael Fassbender character (I won't spoil anything), also, and I felt that the spiritual vs. scientific themes of human origin and creation came across as somewhat heavy-handed.  The film works best, I think, when it is in fright mode.  The gore effects, and the contexts in which they appear, are worthy of the man who directed the first Alien movie, and are sure to please genre fans.  All in all, the film was affecting and pretty intelligent.  The script was also all over the place, which is fine as far as I'm concerned.  It made for some unpredictability in a movie market that is absolutely FULL of predictability.

It is hard to be detailed because I am trying to avoid spoilers. I could not understand the motivation of the characters and the story was not easy to follow. I was shocked that the plot was so poorly written.
  I love science fiction, the Aliens franchise, and Ridley Scott. Believe me that I was looking for reasons to like the movie. I would rate this movie a C-, which I define as viewable but would not be motivated to buy the Blu-ray. The movie felt like it was motivated from the Aliens franchise but did not really add anything to that universe. It also was not drawing on enough of the Aliens movies.

4799240,5,B005LAIHY0,"I've been waiting for this film since I read about it, a couple of years ago. Ridley Scott, Damon Lindelof, Noomi Rapace, link to the ""Alien"" franchise? I'm there, when does it open?

Saw it in IMAX 3D, and that's the way it was meant to be seen. A great use of that median, especially Fassbender's scene with the interstellar map. You feel like you are in the room. It is a spectacular gorgeous film, the fly by over Iceland in the beginning is remarkable, and the action/horror scenes have an added impact, due to the sight and sound technology. Kudos to Scott for using all of it.

Lindelof's script revisits a ""Lost"" theme - Science versus/and faith. Rapace's Shaw is at the center, a scientist who believes in a God, and wants to find the Creator. ""Where did we come from"" is her big question. Rapace is surrounded with a great cast, including Fassbender (who delivers his part excellently), Theron, Elba, Pearce and even Kate Dickie (crazy Lysa Arryns from Game of Thrones.)

It's Ridley's ride, and he takes you from feeling whistful and optimistic to being horrified and scared in the space of 2 hours. It does have all of the elements of the original ""Alien"". Space jockey, face hugger, chest burster, robot, evil corporation, it's all there. Noomi Rapace as Lizbeth Shaw fulfills every expectation I had of her. She is the motor to the movie, the one to watch.

I've read where some folks don't like the film because it doesn't answer any questions. I wouldn't see this movie in that light, since when do we ever get the answers we want with anything Lindelof writes? It is a great sci-fi film, and you should see it if you are a fan of the genre, and especially if you love the ""Alien"" franchise. See it on the big screen, then buy the Blu Ray. Sit back, enjoy.

I was 18 years old when I saw the first ""Alien"" movie in the theater. I remember how it made me feel to this day - scared, horrified, anxious, suspenseful, and finally thrilled when the hero turned out to be a woman. It was the first VHS tape I bought, it was the first DVDs (box set) I bought, I even named my dog Ripley. I love this franchise, and ""Prometheus"" is a fine addition.

EDIT: I was so fascinated by this movie in IMAX 3D I went and saw it again, knowing that I would probably never have that chance again. I spent the week in between reading reviews and interviews about the film.  I enjoyed it as much the second time, and believe that this is one helluva sci-fi film. I'd say it's Scott's best film in years. ""Prometheus"" manages to find a balance as a beautiful, thoughtful clever film, with some very visceral horror thrown in. The action snaps along at brisk pace, the music score is great,and there are some interesting techniques used to move the story along that I've never seen before.

4799242,1,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus, a quasi-prequel to Alien, looks pretty, but makes no sense whatsoever.  Hazarding a guess, I would imagine it began with a stupid script, and then Ridley Scott hired LOST alumnus Damon Lindelof to shroud everything in mystery so you could not tell how stupid it all was.  If you choose to have faith that, in the end, it will somehow all hold together, then you will be invited to buy the DVD or BluRay in the hopes that 20-30 minutes of extended footage will throw some small light on a thousand unanswered questions.  If you are still in the dark (as you surely will be), then you will be invited to further deepen your confusion by viewing the next episode of this unfinished story, due to be released a year or two from now.

The setup:  Peter Weyland (aged billionaire) buys into Von-Daniken-style theories that life on Earth was created and nurtured by alien ""gods"", so he sends the starship PROMETHEUS to find them.  The crew of 17 includes Janek (captain), Chance and Ravel (pilots), Shaw (idiot archaeologist partially to blame for Weyland's dumb theories), Holloway (Shaw's idiot boyfriend), Vickers (inscrutable ice princess), Millburn (idiot biologist), Fifield (idiot geologist), Ford (woman with Scottish accent) and about 8 nameless, faceless nobodies.  Also on board is ""David"" (inscrutable android).

After 2 years in hypersleep and a 35+ light-year journey in the general direction indicated by ancient cave art, these assorted idiots arrive in a distant star system, choose a convenient moon of a convenient gas giant, and, after flying over the surface for a minute or two, land in an almost-random location after noticing some straight lines in the earth.  By luck, it turns out they have landed right next a giant alien pyramid.  They start exploring, and, as you would expect in an Alien prequel, soon start dying horribly.  Despite some assorted mayhem, this film does not work as horror, mainly because the viewer does not give a rat's whisker about any of the people getting killed.  Most victims are completely unlikeable and/or seem to lack any instincts for self-preservation.  If they don't care whether they live or die, then why should we?  Meanwhile, suspension of disbelief is constantly being shattered by the general idiocy of the script.

Don't expect to know what is going on.  While the visuals, events and atmosphere are vaguely similar to the sort you would expect from an Alien movie, the creatures we encounter are not the same, and their precise connection to the creatures we know will remain obscure - adding to the dozens of unanswered questions you will be left with at the film's end.  The failure to tie in directly with ALIEN would be fine if it managed to tell its own story, but it doesn't.

Meanwhile, the film-makers try to impress you by asking ""big questions"" about God, creation, what is the essential difference, if any, between a robot and a human being, whether creating ""life"" makes you a ""god"", etc., etc.  If you have any sense, you will notice that it takes no intelligence to merely ASK such questions, and that the film fails to offer any answers or even meaningful insights concerning them.",1339459200,48,3170,4.902621722846442

dark matter:  cannot be seen, its existence only a hypothetical inference:  23%
dark energy:  another hypothesis, helps explain the the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion:  73%

the ratio here between what is unknown and what is known is thus 24 to 1.
and this ridiculously outsize ratio represents the leading edge of thought in the most mathematically precise (and perhaps paradoxically, most mathematically creative) of the sciences.

""One might say that each time reason encounters something unknown, it tests it to see if it is truly the boundary of reason.  There is no natural limit to this imperialistic expansion of the scope of reason, unless reason does encounter something that is truly beyond its capacity to grasp.  Kierkegaard argues that such an encounter could be viewed as the fulfillment of reason's quest, and not simply a defeat, because 'the ultimate paradox of thought' is 'to discover something that thought itself cannot think' (Philosophical Fragments, p. 37).  It is the passionate quest to find this limit that lies behind reason's restless and relentless search.""  (Kierkegaard, An Introduction, p. 156)

Not completely related of course, but to get to the point of the review, reading back through these notes I have to admit that buried beneath that awesome movie, somewhere within that unfortunately disappointing story, there was a bit of reasonable motivation for the characters of Shaw and David.

David was by far the most compelling, however.  How can you not be fascinated with an android who (that, which, I admit confusion over the proper term here) loves Peter O'Toole as Lawrence?  Although not as overtly emotional and physical as Shaw's quest, his was quietly much more desperate.  And to brutally paraphrase Hugo, desperation in combination with intelligence is worth serious attention.  I hope his character is given greater scope in the next episode.",1339372800,11,1942,5.253246753246753

The story is engaging and enough was left for the imagination to make you exited for potential sequels.

It's not a five star movie for a few reasons (may contain spoilers):

- the movie felt too short, it seems like certain things should have been explained better such as the motivation of the engineers in the very beginning potentially creating humanity and in their desire to later destroy it. Maybe this is left to the imagination or for sequels, but a little more background would have been nice.

- there was a crew of 17 but most of them had little no screen time or simply disappeared, this should have been fleshed out better, again this may have needed more time or was cut out

- many pointed this out but crew behaviour was reckless, the biologist getting cute with the snake, people putting their fingers in all sorts of questionable things and messing with stuff better left alone and in general no respect for the environment

- David's motivation for infecting the other guy was not clear to me. It seems like these androids are a lot of trouble to have around because every other mission they go bad.

Prometheus is among the worst collection of disjoint false starts, unkept promises, and unmotivated action to appear on the screen this century. I have no idea how many writers actually worked on the script, but it is clear that they never spoke to each other. I would characterize Prometheus as a multi-million dollar work of mediocre fan fiction clumsily based on the movie Alien. About twenty minutes into the film I caught myself looking for the slide bar at the bottom of the screen, only to remember that I was actually in a theater.

The truth of the matter can be found in the DVD edition of ""Alien"" during the director's commentary in which Ridley Scott himself talks about his desire over the years to revist the origins of the alien creatures and their link to humanity and uncovering the mystery of the space-ship. If anyone doubts this, listen to his commentary on ""Alien"". But back to ""Promethus"". This film, I believe, is his chance to do just that. And I think he did it masterfully.

However and unfortunately, the film is not without its flaws. I believe these flaws are mostly rooted in the writing and not the directing. The flaws are are in the lack of attempt--perhaps even imagination--to take the familiar conventions of the ""Alien movies"" and up-end them. I'm just going to bullet-point some ideas.

1. Obviously, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece. But generally speaking this type of film that ""Alien"" pioneered--along with most horror films--requires that the characters do stupid things in order to put themselves in harm's way; things such as violating protocol and snooping around when it's readily apparent snooping around isn't such a good idea. Unfortunately, this happens too much in this film. But I digress. Let me revist ""Alien.""

2. About ""Alien."" The thrust of the drama is the various characters violating protocol regarding contamination and setting bad things in motion. Ripley was the character who most adhered to  protocol. However, I cannot remember what ""Mother""--the ship's computer--said if anything about protocol. This leads me to point #3.

3. I believe the characters in ""Prometheus"" violated protocol too early, too easily, too snuggly; and it was something we've all seen before. How to get around this?

4. I think perhaps the writers might have turned this convention on its head. What if these characters were all disciplined from the start in adhering to protocol at all times? Period. Meaning that there was no conflict between them. But, you might say, there would be no conflict if that were the case. Perhaps you are right. Yet, it might just have worked nevertheless. Here's how. What if ""Mother"" gives the all-clear from the get-go upon their awakening from stasis? That would have been an interesting reversal of the story convention. It gives the characters an understandable false sense of security. And since the pitch of this film is that we are going to find the origins of humanity, it creates a different scenario at the start. Yet, it offers some conflict in itself.

5. It could be that Mother genuinely thinks the planet is safe. But Mother, as it turns out, is not as sophisticated as the alien inhabitants of this planet. This would have given the characters sufficient cover to abandon protocol in understandable ways. This also opens up other story possibilities. Is Mother being duplicitous? Is she a traitor to the cause? So, there's room for plot movement and story ambiguity. The major dramatic story questions, among other things, at the start of the movie would have been this: is the planet truly safe? Are the aliens good? Or has Mother made an innocent mistake because the aliens are too sophisticated as we come to see. Or is Mother so sophisticated herself--even beyond the sophisticatation of the aliens that she has to play many cards--both an innocent card and a guilty card--in order to affect the safest outcome for humanity, and thus the ending of the film as it happened. That is, Mother was ahead of the game from the outset, or perhaps she had to catch-up a bit. In this version, Mother trumps all in terms of knowledge.

6. The advantage of this is that it would have elminated the scenes of otherwise smart characters doing stupid things like waving his hand and smiling at an alien tentacle which has risen from murky, alien depths. Well...I could go on about such scenes. And I'm not saying my solution solves all of these problems. But it would have been, perhaps, more disarming for the viewer to see the characters having good cause to have their guards down. It would have also been a bit fresher to see a crew who can act more professionally and not always be at odds with each other. That would have made the events even more frightening. It would have also created more comraderie among the crew intead of, well, alienation. All-for-one-one-for-all. That is to say, thematically, if humanity is to survive, it must learn to cooperate with itself...or else it is vulnerable. Ask yoursef, is humanity now more or less cooperative with itself? Will it ever learn? If so, how? Are the evil aliens in full cooperation with themselves? Yes. Thus, they have the advantage.

7. Nevertheless, this is an awesome movie. I think it's a modern classic. And I loved the double-twist ending.

8. ""Prometheus"" will stand unbound as a modern classic.

9. Last point, I also appreciated the fact that the film clocked-in over two hours. Not everybody has the attention span of a hyper-active adolescent.",1339372800,19,5389,4.846739130434782
4799329,4,B005LAIHY0,"These are impressions I typed up after seeing it last weekend.

- Overall Rating:  8.5/10

5 of us went, and we went to a restaurant after and talked about it for an hour.  After we did I asked for ratings out of 4.

Me - 3.5/4 (I upped my review above to 8.5/10 which is close to 3.5/4.
Wife - 3.5/4
Brother - Initially said 4/4, then backed off to 3.5/4
Male friend - 3.5/4
Female friend - 3.5/4.  This one blew me away, because I thought she would HATE this movie.  It's not up her alley AT ALL.  She said she liked it because it was tense and adult, not like Avatar.  Those were her words.  I asked her about the xenosnake going down the guys throat (she was squirming like crazy during that part) and she said she loved it.  Go figure.

- Awesome FX, great 3D, amazing design, amazing filming/cinematography.  No debate there.
- The main story is pretty simplistic, it parallels Alien (and unfortunately AVP).  The difference is the whole spiritual subplot...and I think that needed some more work.
- Needed more engineer action IMO.  They were under utilized.  The surviving engineer is barely in the movie.  The engineers were in the first and last shot of the movie but kind of ignored as the central antagonist of the movie.  Really disappointed in this aspect of the movie.
The xeno scene at the end was both necessary and completely unnecessary at the same time.  I really wouldn't have cared one bit if they'd never tied this to Alien at all.  I was perfectly willing to keep this completely separate.
- I still maintain that the central story is about Weyland even though he's barely in it.  Everything David does is because of Weyland.  David has no agenda or motivation beyond that.  Everything Vickers does is to defy her father.
- The motives of Holloway and Shaw are secondary (yet more interesting, and left mostly unexplored and fleshed out).  I'm hoping the sequel will explore this side of it more since Shaw seemed damned determined to find out.  I wished they had focused on either Weyland's quest for immortality OR Shaw's quest for the mysteries of life/creation.  Mixing them together led to both being muted.
- I found the acting to be pretty solid (Fassbender stands out as everyone has said).  There are bad lines, but that's not the fault of the acting.
- I find movies that create questions to be just as satisfying as those that spoon feed us the answers.  The Fountain is like this.  A million questions but I still liked it.  Prometheus is in the vein.
- Fox marketing really screwed the pooch on the trailers.  They DID show way too much.  The viral aspects have been brilliant though.
- I think this movie was cut in the hope of a PG-13 rating, and they barely missed it.  I assumed there was way more gore and horror than was shown in the trailers.  But there isn't.  Which begs the question...why can we see almost all the gore and horror in the trailers yet it gets an R rating?  I think a lot of good bits are sitting on hard drives somewhere.
- Wanted:  Extended director's cut.

- Lastly...I will never spoil myself as bad as I have on this movie...ever...again.",1339372800,6,3105,4.49820788530466

4799331,5,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is an amazing SciFi epic with the best visuals I've seen in film to date. Simply put, Ridley Scott shot a breathtakingly beautiful film; the Real3D is amazing and isn't poorly done like in some converted films. Every frame in this film is beautiful and, although limited, the computer-generated images are stunning. Also, the soundtrack matches the film, at least in my opinion. I thought it sounded epic as the crew made their discovery. The music from the trailers and the teasers isn't actually heard, or at least I don't remember hearing it.

The acting was great from the whole cast; I didn't see any notable flaws in the acting. The actions of some characters were questionable though. Why would you move toward a snake-like species when you've seen so many unexplained dead bodies already? Aside from a couple of silly, or stupid, character choices, the actual story is amazing. The story is the search for the engineers that may have engineered us; the search for our creators. It builds a very creepy yet fascinating atmosphere filled with the mystery of life. There are many unanswered questions, but I think it was done purposely. It leaves the door open for the very-likely sequel. Regardless, I actually enjoyed the mystery.

This is the best film I've seen all year and possibly last year as well. I don't recommend going into this film expecting a direct prequel to Alien, since it really isn't. It can really standalone. But there is a cool treat for Alien fans at the end that I actually enjoyed. I highly recommend it.",1339372800,12,1547,4.81203007518797
4799332,1,B005LAIHY0,"What a mess this movie is. It's not a prequel to the first Alien movie as most people think, so did I, but rather a re-boot. Even so, I had such high hopes and was looking forward to seeing it. It does have some truly excellent visuals and the story-line had great potential but it falls flat, and quickly. Here are just a few examples from many

*****Spoilers Ahead*****

On the alien moon the ship's crew enters one of the `pyramid' rooms which is really inside one of the Engineer's ships. David the android makes a quick comment that the atmosphere is `clean', and pretty soon everyone is taking off their helmets. This would never happen, especially with supposed field professionals; they only know about the air in one room. There's no regard for pathogens, no regard for trapped gases that are toxic and other things that might not show up on routine tests. This scene shows the incredible ignorance of the writer and Scott. Any team would first search and test thoroughly EVERY room before even thinking about removing their helmets.

The Geologist and Biologist, oh my, the horrible writing behind these two. These guys are in the movie only to be killed and to provide Abbott and Costello style comic relief. First when they encounter a dead alien body they suddenly transform into whiny little girls- just awful. Then later while possessing a 3-D map of the whole area and being in contact with the Captain who also has a 3-D map (of a ship that's U-shaped!) these two somehow `get lost'- ridiculous. Finally the pair encounter a hissing snake-like alien that is OBVIOUSLY dangerous, but suddenly they've lost all fear (and intelligence) and proceed to try and play kissy face with the monster- then they get attacked and die- unforgivably bad writing

The Engineer aliens themselves. This race is supposed to be an incredibly advanced people but when the crew finally encounters one he acts like a mindless rhino. Oh and the `Engineers' play little flutes to startup their ships- seriously. In the end Mr. super advanced engineer guy tries to fly away but the cartoon characters left piloting the Prometheus decide to ram his ship. So super advanced Engineer with his super advanced ship can't detect, evade, or stop this ramming and down he goes. His reaction is priceless, he knows there are other Engineer ships he can use, and perhaps even other survivors of his race but instead like a big moron he runs after our young Sigourney Weaver clone with the intention of killing her with his fists! Bad, bad, just bad

How to get an Alien creature: so to get an Alien creature like in the other movies it appears there's a whole new process: first a human male must be infected with a near magical bio weapon black ooze. Then he must have sex and impregnate a human woman who in turn must give birth to a squid creature who then must parasitically infect an Engineer alien. Stir it all up with an exploding Engineer torso and 'B-L-A-M-O' you have the acid blood Alien we all know and love.

This movie is a friggin mess complete with infantile dialog and derivative cartoon characters that insult the audience and expose the writer and director, with this project anyway, as being both incompetent and out of touch.",1339372800,27,3227,4.7229129662522205
4799333,3,B005LAIHY0,I saw this Saturday night and again Sunday afternoon. It is the most beautiful sci-fi flick I've probably ever seen. But there are problems with this movie. It's too vague. A segment here... a segment there... and Prometheus could have been an all time classic. Plus there's one plot line that is totally unnecessary. I'll buy it tho.,1339372800,2,334,4.775862068965517
4799423,2,B005LAIHY0,"This movie looks fantastic. Any fear that it would look too phony of CGI'd are very quickly laid to rest. It looks better than just about any movie ever made.

That's where the good ends.

This script is a disaster. No one ever acts logically, in fact, they almost always act in exact opposition to logic. A scientist that starts an expedition based on no objective interpretation of hard data, but on her ""belief""in what she WANTS her data to mean. Archeologists that are ""depressed"" at the discovery of the first proof of an alien civilization just because they can't talk to any of the long dead aliens. A geologist WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAP THE RUINS they are exploring, who gets LOST despite the fact that HE'S THE ONE WITH THE BLOODY MAP. A biologist who, after seeing a room full of dead alien bodies (done in by some unknown attacker), discovers a giant hissing alien worm and his first reaction is to POKE IT.

This is just the set up to the mess that follows. Entire sequences happen concurrently without ever affecting one another, so that they seem to be from different movies. You keep waiting for the actions in one to affect the other, and they never do, indeed, they often never come up again at all. And the final ""reveals"" are so stupid (not to mention telegraphed) that all the tension in the third act is just sucked out the airlock.

The connections to the Alien movies simply muddle things further. These plot elements don't actually make sense in relation to the original two movies, and they don't add much of anything to the film on its own. This film would have been better off as a stand alone film rather than being a prequel, since the connection only serves to make an incoherent script downright inconsistent.

You could go, scene by scene, through the entire movie, and find something very wrong in each sequence. It's that big a mess. And it's all due to a screenplay that thinks it's being profound by asking ""big questions"" when it has absolutely no idea what questions it is actually asking, let alone how to answer any of them. This is not surprising when you learn that the screenplay was written by one of the showrunners from LOST, the king of ""make-it-up-as-you-go-without-any-idea-where-you're-going"" storytelling.

Any assertions that the movie is somehow deeply profound or spiritual and that those who do not like it just don't ""get it"" is pseudo-intellectual mental masturbation. You might as well assert that you can see the Emperor's new clothes, whereas I see a naked fool walking down the street.

This movie LOOKS and SOUNDS like it should be a really good film, and the performances are for the most part really solid. But don't let the window dressing fool you. A movie is only as good as the story it tells, and this is one cake that's really just an enormous stinking turd covered in deceptively rich frosting.

You won't avoid it. But you should.",1339372800,23,2905,4.671232876712328
4799424,3,B005LAIHY0,"When is a prequel not a prequel? When a studio, let's call them 20th Century Fox, concerned about limiting the audience for their latest, big-budget science-fiction/horror film, PROMETHEUS, sidestep the use of the word prequel in their marketing materials and ask the director, Ridley Scott (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, GLADIATOR, BLADE RUNNER), and the screenwriters, Jon Spaihts (THE DARKEST HOUR) and Damon Lindelof (LOST), to sidestep direct or indirect questions about the connection or connections between PROMETHEUS and Scott's second film, ALIEN. We've been told PROMETHEUS and ALIEN share DNA. We've been also told that PROMETHEUS occurs in the ALIEN universe, but not a prequel to ALIEN. PROMETHEUS is indeed a prequel, albeit an indirect one, meant to launch another trilogy before reaching its inevitable endpoint: ALIEN.

In 2089 C.E. (or A.D. if you prefer), two archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), a true believer of the Judeo-Christian time, and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), Shaw's colleague, lover, and the skeptic to Shaw's believer, discover 35,000-year-old pictograms on an island off the coast of Scotland that seemingly confirm their theory that aliens visited different civilizations in the past. Shaw and Holloway believe the aliens influenced or otherwise directed cultural and possibly biological evolution, an idea that seeped into the pop culture mainstream forty-four years ago when Erich von Dniken published his factually challenged bestseller, ""Chariots of the Gods."" The pictograms contain a star map that Shaw and Holloway interpret as an open invitation for renewed human-alien contact. Shaw implicitly believes in their benevolence. Holloway doesn't seem to share Shaw's optimism, but doesn't completely slip into negativity either. Shaw's optimism proves woefully unfounded we're in the ALIEN universe after all).

Shaw and Holloway's evidence proves sufficient to convince Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the octogenarian CEO of the Weyland Corp., to fund a trillion-dollar expedition to the star system where Shaw and Holloway hope to meet the aliens and get the answers every child or teen asks once or twice: Who are we? Why are we here? Who made us? And to what or for what purpose? Shaw answers, somewhat naively, with religion, but she's still a scientist and as a scientist knowledge, regardless of whether it conflicts or not with religious belief, takes precedence. Holloway is far more the skeptic, the empiricist, the non-believer, but he's just as eager to meet the godlike beings that presumably created us. The science vs. religion debate isn't really a debate, not in a film with a $150 million dollar budget. It's just enough to suggest depth without in fact providing anything approaching depth.

Weyland sends Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), a cold, calculating corporate executive with her eye on the CEO's chair (when Weyland passes into the great corporate beyond, of course), to keep tabs on the expedition. The ship's 17-member crew fulfills its primary function in the ALIEN universe: As fodder for the inevitable outbreak of something or other that decimates the crew. The script gives the secondary and tertiary characters names, but they could be easily called Generic Character No. 1 through Generic Character No. 10 or 11. Even worse, the characters that are coded as ""smart"" (because they're scientists) make fatally idiotic decisions at the worst possible times, presumably because Spaihts and Lindelof ran out of ideas and decided to rely on standard horror-film clichs. Only a few characters make any kid of impression. That's less to do with the screenplay and everything to do with the actors, like the Prometheus' captain, Janek (Idris Elba), who gets minimal screen time or character development, but whose actions suggest a heroic, self-sacrificing nature.

With his dyed blonde hair and mannerisms lifted from his favorite film, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and a secretive, ambiguous agenda (again typical of androids in the ALIEN universe), David (Michael Fassbender) easily emerges as PROMETHEUS's most compelling character. He's first introduced watching over Shaw in her sleep chamber, picking through her childhood memories, a choice that's simultaneously creepy, because it's voyeuristic and a violation, and comprehensible as an expression of David's loneliness. David isn't supposed to have wants or needs, but he evinces them in practically every scene. He also evinces a dry, droll sense of humor that's often misunderstood or ignored by other members of the crew. They treat David less as a valuable member of the crew than a personal valet or even worse. When David makes consequence-heavy decision, he's simultaneously following Weyland's orders and engaging in payback for real and perceived slights.

David, however, can't carry PROMETHEUS alone and either can Shaw as a proto-Ripley action-heroine. While Scott gives Shaw one of the most disturbing, squirm-inducing scenes in the ALIEN mythos, one that easily rivals a similar scene in ALIEN, she doesn't charge in any noticeable way until late (very late) in the film. Rapace's slight stature doesn't help, but Scott could have worked around Rapace's physical limitations with a script with a stronger focus on Shaw. Vickers exists primarily as a link to her predecessors (or rather successors) in the ALIEN universe, as embodiments of the amoral corporate ethos critiqued strongly in ALIENS. Vickers serves another function, but to say more is to spoil one of PROMETHEUS' few remaining surprises. It feels superfluous because, in fact, it is superfluous.

PROMETHEUS suffers from the failure to meet the outsized expectations of ALIEN fans that expected and wanted, if not a carbon copy of the first film in the series, then something substantially similar, yet uniquely different to ALIEN. ALIEN centered on the crew of the Nostromo, a commercial freighter in the not-so-distant future. After the Nostromo's crew responds to a non-human distress beacon, they discover a long-dead, non-human pilot, the Space Jockey, and derelict spaceship's deadly alien cargo. ALIEN's lone survivor, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), appeared in three subsequent films of uneven quality. Only James Cameron's ALIENS matched ALIEN's ambitious scope and scale. Both films are justifiably considered genre classics if not outright genre masterpieces. Returning to the ALIEN universe and answering the questions surrounding the Space Jockey, the derelict spaceship, and the mystery surrounding the ship's cargo spurred Scott, working with Spaihts and Lindelof, was always a problematic, even controversial choice. Was answering the questions surrounding the Space Jockey worth exploring or answering? On the strength or rather weakness(es) of PROMETHEUS, the answer is, at best, a qualified one.

PROMETHEUS, however, doesn't offer any ideas, intellectual, metaphysical, scientific or otherwise, that could be described as fresh or original (because they're not). Arthur C. Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END, Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT, Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (among many others) all posited alien visitors for more than just cultural tourism or anthropological explorations of primitive cultures (ours), but also to prod cultural and sometimes biological evolution (ours, again). It's a pity then that Spaihts and Lindelof, following Scott's lead, don't develop the idea beyond the merely functional (to setup sequels to the prequels), but it's hard to blame them or Scott too heavily if PROMETHEUS, a film made by a Hollywood studio specifically to kick off a new, hopefully commercially lucrative franchise, fails to provide narrative or emotional closure, but instead tapers off into an semi-satisfying, sequel-ready ending.

Narrative problems and shortcomings have been more the exception than the norm in Scott's work and while PROMETHEUS is no exception, it's also another example of Scott's strengths as a visual stylist. Scott always seems to have a clear vision of what he wants to achieve cinematically and PROMETHEUS is no different. To that end, Scott shot in Iceland to capture the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the alien moon. Scott's longtime production designer, Arthur Max (BODY OF LIES, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, GLADIATOR, SE7EN), and his cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, bring a palpably believable, not-so-distant future into the present, a present made all the more credible thanks to subtle, immersive 3D. It's clean, pristine, and antiseptic, filled with the floating transparent screens filled with colorful data streams that AVATAR made de rigueur three years ago. The alien structures owe a great deal to H.R. Giger's seminal contribution to ALIEN, expanding on Giger's design work organically, if, at key times, no less repulsively. Scott fully embraces PROMETHEUS' R-rating, crafting several unforgettably repulsive scenes that would make even David ""body horror"" Cronenberg simultaneously recoil in disgust and applaud in appreciation.

4799428,2,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus came out with high, high expectations, so it's no biggie that it didn't live up to that hype. No, there were many different problems, but the biggest one I had with it was that it awkwardly shifted between horror and sci-fi, and doing neither effectively.

Actually the horror aspect wasn't so bad, I got truly scared when I first saw one of the scientists had a pink mowhawk and tattoos. I was really scared for how the movie would turn out. So a crew is sent on a trillion dollar mission to search for life on a distant planet, judging by the sheer enormity of the mission you'd think they'd send only the best and brightest right? Well no, not at all. Almost every crew member makes completely baffling stupid decisions throughout the movie, and the ones that don't make stupid decisions are completely underutilized.

Once they arrive on the planet, they drive down one little valley to the 'tomb' or whatever is located, so that's all you see of the planet, that little valley and the one tomb, ok whatever. So they get into the 'tomb' and one of them decides to pull off his helmet because the air is breatheable. Ok? So what if it's breatheable, what about alien viruses, toxins, bacteria, aren't you guys supposed to be really smar-oh great now they're all removing their helmets. So Ridley Scott made this movie to appeal to mouth-breathing neanderthals, ok whatever maybe it'll be a good horror movie.

So the Punk Scientist (I can't believe what I'm typing) and his ambigiously gay friend go split off from everyone in true bad horror movie writing, and can't find their way out for plot convience. Eventually they get trapped inside the tomb because of a storm and the ship is monitering them. Well only one guys is monitering these two idiots stranded on a planet and all he says to them is 'sleep tight' then laughs at his gay joke. Don't worry it gets dumber. Charlize Thereon, who's made out to be this cold calculating badass captain decides to sleep with the only guy watching the two stranded crew guys, and I think it was at this point where I started chucking candy at the screen. This was directed by the same guy that did Alien, Black Hawk Down, and Gladiator?

So the two scientists are scared s***less about the crew finding other signs of life in the tomb, but when some snake-like creature comes out of the water they're next to, what do they do? Well the choice is obvious, stick your arm out and try to pet it. Then goofus and gallant get picked off in admittably creepy ways while the whole crew on Prometheus is busy f***ing each other. Later in another scene the captain realizes that one of the crewmembers is contaminated and can't come back on the ship, however later when one of the idiots who's been missing for like a day comes back the crew just opens up the hatch without checking him out first, not realizing that the guy is now some angry giant mutant straight outta the Hills Have Eyes.

So it seems like this is going to go for to pure adrenline-rushing horror, but instead Prometheus takes a left turn and brings Guy Pearce in a cheap old man costume out for no reason other than to throw in a tweest, and none of the crew members seem to care, I sure as hell didn't. The rest of the movie turns into some stupid social commentary, such as ""they ain't stupid 'nuff to build weapons of mass destruction on their front doorstep"" or ""what did we do to deserve to die""? Great, now this movie thinks it's smart.

So Prometheus could've been a solid albeit dumb horror movie, but instead it tries to expand upon it's vague half-baked typical self-loathing hollywood message that humans don't deserve to live. Then Ridley Scott shoves his 'working class good, corporations bad' message AGAIN. We see the white collar members are up to no good, scheming behind everyone's back while the cool down to earth blue collar guys are the good guys. The crew don't even get picked off in a tense cool way of getting hunted or anything, they ram their ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible. See kids, Prometheus is too smart to be fun.

So later the crew with Old Guy pearce meet up with the engineer who was sleeping and when they wake him up, does he want to communicate with the beings that he supposedly created? Does he want to assess the situation to know there's a giant ship outside ready to ram his if he tries to escape? Nope, he goes on a gorilla rampage beating everyone then jumps into his ship. Then after the multi-cultural blue collar folks ram into his ship the two leading ladies are being chased by the donut-shaped ship rolling along, only one of them realizing that you should move out of the direction that it's rolling in.

Prometheus is a flat out disappointment. Nice set designs and atmosphere don't erase poor script-writing and a geniuenly lame story, Prometheus is made for idiots who want to pretend that they're smart.",1339372800,42,4907,4.568181818181818
4799429,4,B005LAIHY0,"Sir Ridley Scott is classified as a ""visual director"" Blade Runner's visual effects rivals Prometheus. Althought Blade Runner wasn't socially accepted during its early years...later on it becomes a 'cult following' to a classic ending up on multiple 'best of list'. It looks to me that Prometheus will eventually win over its nay-sayers of even the ""Alien vs Predator"" fan club as well. Prometheus basically stands on its own...a beginning of 'things to come' - hopefully...that's yet to be determined by ""The Hollywood Universe"". This movie appears to be a first chapter of a new series...the orgins of Alien or even Blade Runner itself (well, I don't think Weyland & Tyrell Corp. have anything to do with each other). The unanswered questions of man's existance will(fingers crossed)be challenged in the next film(s)- It's good to see a film without the unnecessary ""loud effects"" & cheesey lines...great things come in forms of accidents not generic unrecyclable...stuff.",1339372800,38,974,5.290322580645161
4799430,3,B005LAIHY0,"I was hoping for way better.

I had immediately placed this pre-order in my cart when I saw it.  Having now seen the movie, I'm only interested IF they included what they obviously must have LEFT OUT from the theatrical release.

Even with an ""extended"" edition, if it not >45-minutes< or more, I may not even bother!

For a trillion dollar mission, and THE most important mission Man could ever undertake, I think they could have found a more intelligent and mature set of folk for the task at hand, not the handful of bumbling fools seen here.

For any movie to be successful, you have to develop your set of characters and show how they each deal with the situations presented to them, in the hope that you begin to care about them and perhaps identify or bond with them.

I didn't hardly care about these characters at all, and unfortunately, it appears the movie didn't care about them either.",1339372800,5,898,4.546583850931677

The 3-D effects in this movie are awesome and there is a musical score from ""Alien"" that is played in this movie so I thought that was really cool. There was alos a part in the movie that reminded me of 2001:Space Odyssey when David the android was talking to the computer,kinda reminded me of ""Hal"".(LOL).Now for those who are not familiar with the Alien and ""yes"" Predator series,it all ties in at some point. Guy Pearce who played Peter Weyland is the son of Charles Bishop Weyland who was played by Lance Henriksen in AVP but that's another story and it still leaves many unanswered questions. Back to Prometheus. Again,a wonderful movie. The Prometheus ship looks awesome and the storyline was great. At first I gave it a 4 but now it's a 5.",1339372800,10,919,4.644171779141105
4799432,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" is the yin to ""Avatar's"" yang. Both are high-budget, visually stunning sci-fi films. But while James Cameron's ""Avatar"" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, ""Prometheus"" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.

Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or ""Engineers"" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).

And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the ""Alien"" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called ""Prometheus,"" which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of ""Oedipus"" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it.

""Don't we all want to see our parents die?"" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se. But the film explores, on many levels, the oftentimes antagonistic relationship between parent/child and creator/creation.",1339372800,10,2244,5.176308539944904
4799523,3,B005LAIHY0,"It is 2093 and the scientific exploration ship Prometheus is approaching the distant planetoid LV233. The crew are hoping to unlock the secrets of mankind's past, but they soon come to realise that some secrets are best left alone.

So, some thirty years on, Sir Ridley treats us to another installment in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B006MGB31Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;franchise: Prometheus is intended, not as a prequel to the travails of the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo but rather as a prelude, exploring the origins of the Space Jockey race that was introduced (briefly) in that film.

Let's start with the good bits... there's no denying that this is a jaw-droppingly, eye-crossingly, mouth-wateringly good looking film. It's classic Ridley Scott; atmospheric, sumptuously detailed, gorgeously lit - easily up there with Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Close Encounters as a visual spectacle par excellence. The CGI is plentiful, as one comes to expect with modern cinema (especially in the scifi/fantasy genre) but it is used with great artistry and panache.

The story is, given the circumstances, original enough and the panspermia origins idea has an interesting modern resonance that will delight or annoy. Much is left unsaid, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions (whilst simultaneously paving the way for a sequel), although the story is somewhat confusing, making a second or third watching essential. The details do let the film down a little though and my guess is that amateur biologists will have many a bone to pick with the film's writer. It has already been noted that some of the other details are a little off kilter (to be generous), for instance spending a trillion dollars on such a huge space mission and then manning it with a bunch of (let's be honest) incomptetent amateurs just doesn't make sense.

The acting is... adequate. Wheras Scott managed to crew the Nostromo with some excellent performers (I'm thinking of Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm), the best he can do here is Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace, neither of whom will win the film any Oscars, I'm afraid. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly egregious going on here, but neither are there any stand-out performances. OK, perhaps I'm being a little unfair: Fassbender's depiction of the android David is rather tasty, but I would say that he steals the film, highlighting the ordinariness of his co-actors rather than lifting their performances.

My main complaint is that Scott, despite his protestations that Prometheus is NOT a prequel to Alien, has simply warmed over many of the themes, images and ideas that he adressed in that film. The decor and external design of the ship Prometheus looks suspiciously Nostromo-esque, David plays an almost identical role to Ash (and eventually meets a very similar end) and the film explores the same rape and childbirth-horror themes as did the original film. The life-raft? The flamethrowers? The xenomorph eggs/DNA jars? Which film was I watching? I would even go so far as to suggest that the film draws very heavily on the second of the sequence ""Aliens"". Of course Scott wanted to maintain coherence and consistency across the canon but I think he may have gone too far and it simply looks like he picked out the best bits of Alien and had another go at them with Prometheus.

Well, there you go. On balance, this is an excellent scifi thriller and I have no hesitation in recommending it: the story tickles, tempts and teases and there's sufficient tentacle madness to please the hoariest xenomorph hunter. Although it's let down by some unimaginitive writing and not helped by some uninspired acting, it stands it's ground manfully, looks good enough to eat and has great rewatch potential.

Oh yes, and you get to see Ms Theron and Ms Rapace in their scanties. Result.",1339372800,8,3943,5.170846394984326
4799524,1,B005LAIHY0,"What a stunning, totally unexpected letdown for me after anticipating ""Prometheus"" for months. It was simply godawful: the screenplay, the casting, the acting (except for Michael Fassbender), the editing, the musical score...all a giant mess.

4799525,5,B005LAIHY0,"I saw the two original Alien movies when I was young enough that they would forge my lifelong love of movies. These films transcended the science fiction I was used to seeing and offered a grown-up, more cynical and dangerous version of Star Wars, Star Trek and the like. So I was one of the first in line to get tickets to Prometheus which I hoped would reboot the franchise and erase the memory of the later inferior Alien films.

Overall, there are moments of supreme cinematic greatness combined with a few gaffs of bad science and plot logic but largely it's a fusion of some of Ridley Scott's most brilliant themes.

*** Potential spoilers ahead ***

First, the weaker parts: scientists discover a drawing of 5 dots in a cave in Scotland which they've seen in other caves throughout history - they take the massive leap of logic to presume that not only did these come from aliens as a map, but these same aliens were the creators of humans. These scientists use this flimsy thesis to convince a death-obsessed rich guy to funnel one trillion dollars into developing the technology to reach the dots.

The really bad science doesn't end there. Once we reach the alien cave, they continue to make one bad decision after another despite some very scary things happening. This is where it lurches more into the teen horror flick genre where characters disband, poke around the dark and inevitably meet their Alien-oriented grisly endings.

There are also some weaker moments of dialog that seem like a tack-on from test audience screenings not understanding what's happening: one has Shaw discussing her infertility with her partner in a conversational segway that's really off. Later, Charlize Theron reveals her true relationship with Weyland which is a little tired. I'm probably being a little harsh because I expect so much from this film.

But on the plus side, this is an excellent movie in any regular context but also a welcome addition to the Alien universe. There is so much overlap from Alien and Aliens that there is a sense of having seen much of it all before but large parts of the idea do stand on their own. There are some truly great horror moments that are simultaneously gripping, revolting, disturbing and original, and it's these handful of scenes that stand out after watching the whole thing.

The visuals have never been better, featuring an alien landscape that's seductive, fluid and organic, supported by the invisible use of first class CGI - and it looks even better in 3D. Whereas Alien pulled back from the full sexuality of H R Giger's designs, this film doesn't pull punches in the creature designs and attacks of the face-huggers. The design of the engineers, the creative use of holograms and look of the ship are all extremely well conceived.

This is also an exceptional cast. Noomi Rapace reminded me of how great Sigourney Weaver was and delivers ferociously in this role. Similarly Michael Fassbender crafts a delicate performance as the ship's android, treading the line between its appreciation of the beauty of life's designs and the psychotic nature of something that can think but not feel. His character is essential in connecting the themes of death being a part of life and the desire to meet and sometimes destroy your creator.

This is all wrapped in a very, very complicated backstory about how the engineers spread life around the universe like space-travelling gardeners. There are mythical connections to Prometheus (wiki it to see) and some not-too-subtle religious parallels (Shaw is a barren woman made pregnant by God?). There are strong themes of selfishness and self sacrifice, natural death and immortality, and many many references to other science fiction works.

It's worthy of five stars since it's a league ahead of anything else I've seen this year and it's good to see Ridley Scott at the top of his game.",1339372800,324,3878,4.871016691957512
4799526,2,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS is a mushy mix-up of science fiction, horror, and new-age spirituality.  The film, set in the year 2093 (29 years before the action in the 1979 film ALIEN takes place), suggests that alien humanoid beings ""seeded"" the earth with their own DNA (or a combination of their own DNA and manufactured DNA) in order to create intelligent life.  These alien humanoid beings are the ""space jockeys"" first seen in the 1979 film - they are the pilots of the derelict space ship Ripley and her crew discover on the surface of LV-426.  As Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) concludes in PROMETHEUS, they are the ""engineers"" of humanity, or the architects of our intelligent design.

This all sounds very deep and complex and earth-shattering, and it could have been.  But it isn't.  Because very little is actually revealed about the ""space jockeys,"" their purpose in the universe, or their ultimate connection to life as we know it.  This is a story created backwards.  Scott and his cohorts (including LOST's Damon Lindelof) are doing the ""reboot"" thing in PROMETHEUS.  They take the known Alien universe and re-engineer it to set up a new legion of films.  These won't be films about Aliens . . . or even about space.  These are films about creationism.  Who is our father, this film asks.  Who created us?  And why do we ultimately want to destroy our creator, just as our creator wants to destroy us?

Basically, PROMETHEUS is about a team of scientists on a corporate-sponsored mission to discover the origins of humanity.  They follow star charts discovered in ancient cave drawings to a planetoid (or moon) light years away, on which they find the remains of a humanoid outpost - the ""space jockeys"" of ALIEN fame.  Once they get there, they behave in very unscientific fashion, making every mistake in the book (why, oh why didn't they watch a few sci-fi movies before venturing into that freaky bunker?).  Again, there are cool visuals . . . and a few heart-jumping action scenes.  Bad things happen and a lot of people die.  But it all feels very formulaic, very reminiscent of the other movies, almost as if it was put together from a targeted list (infected crewmember wants back onto the ship, check!; creepy worm thing plunges down someone's throat, check!; someone is ""impregnated,"" check!; someone else is chest-busted, check!; water drips everywhere, check!).

And not one character is particularly likable or memorable or interesting in any way.  Corporate hack Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is a cool icy blond with little to do in the film but walk around and act like she owns the ship (which I guess she does) - she is part of neither the action nor the spiritual heart of the film.  She's just there, and she's dull as dirt.  Shaw (Rapace) is supposed to be the Ripley character, the strong, resourceful woman with the guts to survive.  But she's weepy and silly, making bad decision after bad decision - the worst of which is to get too close to equally silly boyfriend Dr. Charley Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green).  Robot David (Michael Fassbender) is what we expect a robot to be - he alternates between sounding like Hal from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Data from STNG.  We know what robots are like in these films - they're either evil corporate stooges (like Ash in ALIEN) or friendly protectors of humanity (like Bishop in ALIENS).  David is more like Data, I guess - he is intrigued by humanity and by his connection to his creator, corporate honcho Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, in a horrific old-guy suit).  I guess you could say that David is the most interesting character in the film . . . but that's not saying all that much.  He brings little to the franchise that hasn't already been seen a hundred times.

The problem is, Lindelof is doing his ""Lost thing"" here.  He throws out just enough intriguing stuff to get his viewers scratching their heads.  What planet do we really see in the opening scenes of the film?  There's a gorgeous waterfall and breathtaking vistas.  There's a cool saucer-shaped ship, and something really strange and portentous happens.  Is it Earth?  Is it?  And what planet (or moon or planetoid) do our intrepid band of scientists visit?  Is it the same planet on which ALIEN and ALIENS take place?  Or some other planet in the same system?  So does that mean two ""space jockey"" ships crash land in exactly the same way on two different planets?  And what's the black goo all about, and those tiny worms, and the octopus thing?  And why does the technology in 2093 seem light years ahead of the technology in 2122?  Ask all you like, because there are no answers here.  There are ""suggestions,"" of course.  And you can make of them whatever you like.  It's the easiest kind of screenplay to write - don't worry about it all making sense; the viewers will fill in the blanks for you!

Ultimately, PROMETHEUS is a watchable mess, a conglomeration of stuff that could, in less fractured hands, have come together into a truly great film.  As it is, Scott bows to Lindelof and we get little more than a watchable mess.  It's a gorgeous film, and it's worth seeing.  But it makes little sense.  Wait . . . the sequels will clear everything up for us!  Sure, Mr. Lindelof.  That's what you said about LOST.",1339372800,8,5277,4.715536105032823

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

I have just finished viewing today 'Prometheus' and 'Snow White & The Huntsman', (see my review on the later as well).  I can honestly say viewing these 2 movies back to back, I preferred 'Snow White...'.  Let me also state that I am a hard-core Sci-Fi fan.  I am not easily confused by Science Fiction movies.  Not like my brother...come on is the time travel concept from 'Terminator' so complicated?  John Conner in the future sent his dad back in time to protect and i.e. father him, easy.  Why is this so confusing, yes John Conner is older than his father...in the future.  Well...I feel like my brother now after watching 'Prometheus', but I will give this review/analysis my best try.  Here it goes...

--Casting Choices/Some of the Main Actors--

Michael Fassbender as ""David"":  By far the most interesting character in the whole film.  David is of course an android in the manner that ""Ash"" and ""Bishop"" were androids in the other 'Alien' films.  Fassbender though takes a unique spin on being an artificial lifeform.  Every aspect of his performance makes him appear un-human.  The way he walks, his speach, the way he sits completely erect in a chair versus slumping down like we humans do.  David is also extremely intelligent, but is treated like a slave by the other humans.  They are practically calling him ""boy"" in the movie.  David of course is forced to serve, it's part of his programming.  Unlike other androids in the 'Alien' franchise, David does not go into hyper-sleep.  He maintains the ship, oversees the slumbering passengers and spends his free time learning dead lanuages and watching 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  By the way writers, cool move having David dye and style his hair after a young Peter O'toole.  I personally thought that was neat having him altering his appearance after an actor he loved watching.  Being alone for over 2 years though probably hasn't done David any good, solitude even for androids is bad...  I read that Fassbender modeled his performance after the replicant ""Rachael"" in 'Blade Runner' and the voice of Hal from '200l...', along with other inspirations.  This is clear in the movie as David starts to develope his own unique versions of emotions, which isn't good for us.  One thing, what's with the name ""David"" and Sci-Fi films?  David in '2001...', David in 'Independance Day', David Bowie in 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', David the android in 'A.I.', time for some new names writers...

Guy Pearce as ""Peter Weyland"":  Pearce is the current Weyland in this film.  Apx 5 minutes of screen time is all he had, as an extremely old man.  Nothing memorable, nothing quite going into any depth about.  Just an old man desperate to escape death.

Charlize Theron as ""Meredith Vickers"":  The woman with the power in this movie.  Theron's screen time is also not that much, apx 25 minutes total, which is probably why she is listed last on the opening credits...  Theron does not have many action sequences in the film, really she just stands around a lot.  I read tonight that she is a big smoker and this limited her action sequences in the film.  Limited them, ELIMINATED them more like it.  Acting wise she does not give the best performance in this film.  It ends up feeling like is was just a side project for her, a paycheck, nothing more.  Could be I'm also missing Sigourney Weaver.

Noomi Rapace as ""Elizabeth Shaw"":  The Sigourney Weaver of this movie.  Rapace's on screen performance was paled by Fassbender's but still one of the best in the film.  A scientist out to unravel the secrets of our existence, she still chooses to wear her father's cross around her neck.  By far one of the strongest female characters I've seen in film, I mean come on the woman gives herself a C-Section.  I practically piss my pants when I hear my dentist rev up his his tooth drill, I doubt I could ever give MYSELF a surgery like she did.  The only thing I didn't like was that everything is going to hell and she doesn't leave.  I mean come on, if I was impregnated with an ""octopus"" and had to cut it out myself, I would be firing up the rockets asap and setting myself a course for anywhere but that place.

There are other actors of course, but due to review size constraints on Amazon, coupled with the fact that most of the other actors give less than memorable performances I will stop here.

***Plot Details/Analysis, Warning: Spoilers Ahead***

The film begins with us the viewer seeing Earth in the past.  A large extraterrestrial space ship is leaving our planet.  A lone cloaked being is left behind.  After he removes his cloak we see he is fact humanoid.  He proceeds to open a device and drink a black fluid.  He then dies, dissentagrating and falling into the tidal pools below.  It's alluded to that he basically ""unravels"" and his DNA is left intact in the waters, serving as the base material for our evolution.  Okay...

Jump forward to 2089, a team of archaeologists discover a cave with 35,000 year old (or older) cave paintings in it.  The paintings have ancient man pointing towards the heavens at a particular set of stars.  This alludes to ancient man having encounters with an alien race and maybe more...

Flash forward another 4 years, 2093.  The ship Prometheus is heading toward an unknown destination with I believe 17 passengers.  The only awake ""person"" on board is David, an android created by the Weyland Corporation.  David oversees the ship and it's sleeping crew, rides his bicycle and shots basketball.  He also is in the process of learning all the ancient dead lanuages he can.  After 2 years of flight the vessel has reached it's destination and starts to automatically wake up the passengers.

It is soon revealed in a crew meeting what the purpose of this trip is, to meet our makers, literally.  Dubbing this aliens ""Engineers"" the goal is to make contact and to ascertain the answers to our most burning questions about our existence.  Why are we here and all that...

Not long after the crew has touched down and is embarking toward a structure on the planet's surface that is obviously not natural.  Once inside the crew starts to ""map"" the tunnel system.  It is uncovered that there is a dead ""Engineer"" in one of the tunnels, decapitated by a bulk head door coming down apx 2000 years ago.  This is also were the crew discovers a room filled with jars, jars that after the door is opened start to excrete a black ooze.  They also find the ""Engineer's"" head.  Without the crew noticing, earthworms start to come up out of the ground and swim around in this ooze.

Out of nowhere a violent storm erupts outside and the crew is forced to evac back to the ship.  2 crew members are left behind though.  Once back on the ship Shaw realizes the ""Engineer's"" head is actually encased in a helmet.  After David removes the helmet our scientists see that the ""Engineer's"" are in fact VERY similar to us in appearance.  They try to reanimate his head, failing, and the head explodes.  After sampling some the head material Shaw is astounded that the DNA is an exact match to human DNA.

Well...things start to go from bad to worse.  David cracks open the jar he has brought back with him and after getting a sample of the black ooze, purposely infects Charlie Holloway.  Shaw and Holloway have sex and Shaw is unknowingly impregnated with Holloway's mutated sperm.

To sum up (I feel this review is becoming too long), Holloway mutates rapidly and is incinerated by Vickers.  Shaw is informed by David that she is pregnant.  After escaping the medical lab she gets into a surgery pod and gives herself an emergency C-Section.  What is removed is similar to an octopus and is not happy about being removed early.  Shaw escapes and traps the creature in the surgery pod.  It appears the worms mentioned earlier have mutated into a form of ""face-hugger"", complete with molecular acid for blood.  One of these ""face-hugger's"" successfully latchs onto one of the 2 crew members left behind during the evac.  The other crew member get's his helmet burned off with acid and falls into the black ooze, causing him to mutate and return to the ship and attack the crew.  He is finally killed, after killing at least 4 people.

It is about this time that the film FINALLY starts to tie up some loose ends.  It is revealed that the elderly Peter Weyland is in fact on board in stasis.  He has been awakened and is preparing to embark toward the alien structure, in hopes these ""makers"" can save his life.  David has successfully found an ""Engineer"" alive and in a hyper-sleep chamber.  Vickers is revealed to be Weyland's daughter and she is strickly along to have proof when her father dies, so she can return home and become the new CEO of Weyland without any questions.  David admits to Shaw he infected Holloway with the mutating ooze.

It is also this time in the movie that Captain Janek (Idris Elba) reveals what this place is.  This planet is a weapon testing facility.  The ""Engineers"" here are making biological weapons and this place is not their home planet, but just an outpost.

David, Weyland and Shaw re-enter the structure and awaken the ""Engineer"".  David states that the bio-weapons on board were originally meant to be sent to Earth to exterminate us, at least until something went wrong killing all but one of the ""Engineers"".  The awakened ""Engineer"" has no interest in talking, rips off David's head and beats Weyland to death with it.  He then attempts to lauch the buried alien space craft and head to Earth with the lethel payload of black mutating ooze.  The Prometheus rams the alien space craft, wrecking it.  Everybody but Shaw dies.  David although decapitated is still functioning and warns Shaw that the ""Engineer"" is coming.  Shaw makes her way to the ejected lift-raft.  The ""Engineer"" forces his way inside desperately wanting to kill her.  Shaw realizes that the surgical pod is inside the lift raft and the aborted life-form has now grown to tremendous size.  She releases it and it attacks the ""Engineer"".  She escapes.  The aborted life-form turns out to be a giant ""face-hugger"" and quickly latches onto the ""Engineer"" and proceeds to impregnate him.  Shaw goes back and recovers David's head and body.  David reveals that there many ships buried throughout the planet and that he could if repaired pilot on of them and return Shaw and him to Earth.  Shaw says she has no plans of returning to Earth and instead wants to go where the ""Engineers"" come from, and confront them.

Not long after, Shaw and David are shown flying another alien spacecraft off the planet, towards presumably the ""Engineers"" home planet.  We flash back to the life raft.  The ""face-hugger"" is dead.  The ""Engineer's"" body is ripped open and out comes a similar in appearance ""Xenomorph"" Alien.  It hisses and protudes it's jaws out of it's mouth...

---Flaws With The Movie---

I know that this review is approaching mammoth size.  If your still with me at this point, thank you.  I'll try to sum things up.

This movie above all suffers from BAD WRITING.  Not much makes sense.  Here is a list off the top of my head of things that were not hashed out properly:

1. Your telling me the only way an alien race could seed our planet with life is for
  one of their own to die?

2. Why would the ""Engineers"" create us, than millions of years later want to kill
  us?

3. What exactly was the plan to kill us?  Drop that black ooze on us and mutate us?

4. Why did David purposely infect Holloway?  What did he gain by doing this?

5. Okay, so there is a lot of these buried ""Engineer"" spacecraft throughout the
  planet, did they all suffer from breachs in containment?  Wouldn't some of them
  have been able to launch?

6. If this is truly the same planet from 'Alien' and 'Aliens', wouldn't some of
  these buried ships have been found by some of the settlers or exploration teams?
  If this planet is capable of sustaining life, with the only bad condition being
  too much CO2 in the air, why were there terraformers in 'Aliens' transforming it?

7. How does this all fit into the 'Alien' mythology?  The alien ship featured in
  'Prometheus' is supposedly I read not the same alien ship from 'Alien', so where
  did the Xenomorphs we are all familier with come from?  I'm assuming they were
  just another weapon being developed, on another ship perhaps?
  How did the ""Predators"" get a hold of them for hunting?

Sadly the list goes on and on, and I'm out of road here.  Obviously the writers for this film had some grand scheme in mind, but failed to transmit it onto the screen.

---In Conclusion---

This Sci-Fi film tries to pass itself off as a horror/thriller, but fails.  I was never scared or anoxious once while watching it.  Poor writing kills this movie's flow and leaves you scratching your head as the end credits start to roll.  Fans of the 'Alien' franchise who go seeing this hoping for answers concerning the Xenomorphs will leave wanting.  There is no unifying elements in this film at all.  I know that the ""Engineers"" are responsible for the creation of Humans and the Xenomorphs, but the explanations stop there.  Is this worth seeing?  Only if your a die hard fan of Science Fiction, but go into this knowing that answers will not be awaiting you.  Also don't waste your money on 3-D, I watched this in 2-D and could see no elements that would have been enhanced by 3-D.

In the end I'll probably end up buying this for my collection, I'm a completist.  But I will be waiting a LONG time for the price to drop.  This is no more than a 9.99 purchase.

Well that's my review.  Sorry for the length, this film DEMANDED an in depth review.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to go ice my hands, their tired from typing...

The audience finally knows information on the space jockeys and the space ships they fly. People will find anything to criticize this film. If those naysayers find one thing odd about it, they will say it's a horrible film. Pundits of this film are angered at all of the plot holes in this film, but in actuality it may not be a plot hole because if a sequel is made, those questions will be answered. This is a truly great film and ranks up with the original Alien movie. For me, it's the best movie of the year by far. Also, the 3D effects were the best I've seen since Avatar. I usually complain about 3D movies because the effects aren't all that great, but this film pulls it off extremely well. It's an edge of your seat thriller and you'll be mesmerized hours after seeing it, it won't leave your mind. So go out there and see it, you won't regret it.",1339286400,16,1005,4.294736842105263

It asks some really complicated questions about human nature and our quest for answers and purpose, our fear of death, our lust for the unknown, and the dangers of these very human matters. It doesn't answer these questions, which is the whole point. These are questions that can't be answered, only considered, and they subtly imply this theme through situations in the movie.

Unlike some of the other opinions ive read, I thoroughly enjoyed the existential foundation of Prometheus. Questions were posed and, for the most part, answered (within reason...some of the questions were never meant to be answered). I feel like Prometheus really needs another film or two to fully flesh out the intriguing groundwork that it began (and to further tie into the alien canon/biology etc.). Though maybe not a ""prequel"" in the traditional sense, prometheus definitely resides within the confines of the fictional world that was constructed in alien, aliens, and alien 3 (yes, i left out the travesty known as alien ""insurrection""). The biggest questions I have concern the various forms of alien biology explored in the film. Id really like to see the biological progression moved forward and explained a bit more in future films. anyways...enjoyed the movie. I particularly enjoyed the many strands of subtext runnning through prometheus. I plan on buying the blu -ray (2D forever!) Try not to let all of the hype and history blow things out of proportion for you. Just do your homework and appreciate the film for what it is.

4799531,1,B005LAIHY0,"The basic premise was good - scientist think they've found our ""creators,"" but also find the creators believe they made a mistake in our creation.

But the execution was seriously flawed.  Some action was simply unnecessary and formulaic (like dropping the head and the subsequent rescue from the storm or the deaths of the two explorers who decided to separate themselves from the group - they might as well have been extras on an ""away mission"" in the original Star Trek).  Much was just plain stupid, such as re-animating a 2,000+ year old decapited head with electrical stimulation - this was doubly stupid as it did nothing to advance the plot, just like the storm rescue - David's infection of one of the characters, putting everyone on the Prometheus, including his boss and creator Weyland, at risk (he appeared to rever him), and Shaw's operation, from which she seemed to recover waaaaay too quickly (I thought these Alien creatures were virtually impossible to remove?  Obviously not when you have an autodoc - nod to Larry Niven).  Then there was the simply unbelieveable - like setting down on the planet right where they needed to land, just by coincidence!  (Hint for the next director to tackle such a movie - explain that a probe went into orbit six months before the astronauts' arrival, and a planetary survey was transmitted to them before they got there.)  Common sense left completely when a late scene shows Shaw rappeling out of the creator ship.  Why didn't she just get out the way she went in?  If she did go in that way (the fact that her ATV was awaiting near her point of exit suggests that she did), how did she get up there?

The list goes on.  Other commentators here have pointed out several other equally ridiculous plot devices, cliches, and similar problems.

It would probably deserve 2 stars, but coming from Ridley Scott with such fanfare and expectation, it falls all the more mightily.  God, I hope he doesn't make a new ""Blade Runner"" movie.  I fear it may be as awful.  ""John Carter"" was actually a better movie (it was fantasy, at least), yet inexplicably, it was panned by the critics while ""Prometheus"" is getting decent reviews.  It was terrible!  Scott has directed a bomb here, and it deserves to tank (although it will probably make a mint).",1339286400,22,2292,4.732997481108312

As Dave craddled the earth in his right hand during one of most awing inspiring scenes in recent date for a movie, Ridley Scott crushed the life out of this movie in his left hand with a misguided effort trying to tie two movies together that didn't need to be. This movie truly needed to be a stand alone story. Had it been it wouldnt have been crushed under the weight of expectation.

This was worse than Alien Resurrection due solely to the pedigree that presented this newest work. While the movie looks astonishing it managed to offer no coherent storyline and lacked any true character. The actors were stellar, they we all very convincing in their roles. That said this film is an utter disaster in directing, writing and editing. However I am still going to buy it just for the 3D.",1339286400,13,794,4.513888888888889
4799603,2,B005LAIHY0,"MOVIE REVIEW #37: "" Prometheus ""

Director and Producer Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) is back and unfortunately (or apparently) he didn't read this script very closely. I am a big fan of ALL of Ridley Scott's projects and even his weakest films (1942, Kingdom of Heaven) have had something of value in them in regards either their characters or story - but Prometheus - wow...I was a severe disappointment.

Let me tell you what's good about it - It does have two really great performances by the creepy and mysterious Android David played amazingly and hauntingly by Michael Fassbinder (300, X-Men First Class) - and - the spaceships main scientist (Elizabeth Shaw) played by intensely and passionately by Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These were some of the most dramatic highlights/scenes of the film.

The story written by first time writer John Spaihts and Damon Lindeloff -(Cowboys & Aliens, Lost) - takes a giant leap from the original Alien four films and is trying to be a prequel to the entire franchise. The story is full of holes, the logistics of some of the action had the audience rolling their eyes in `you gotta be kidding' style. The theatrical trailer made me excited and eager to see this film - coupled with the fact it was directed by the `former' master of modern-day suspense Ridley Scott.  I was so disappointed. Yes it has Aliens - different in style, face-huggers that now look like octopuses and the incubation process is completely different - involving worms in the eyeballs! Need I say more?

The Prometheus crew is assigned on a two-year long term mission to investigate a serious of pictographs found in various Earth cultures over centuries of time which leads them to the race of super tall beings (great CG effects here) that actually `seeded' Earth millennium's ago. Turns out - they - made a mistake - we don't know why - but apparently they create a biological weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.

The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative. Using the production design that reminded my of the first two Alien films in a more cleaner and sleeker design. But this film lacked the story, realistic actions and the heart that the first two Alien films had and it was extremely unbelievable to me.

Charlize Theron as the daughter of the mission financier (Snow White and the Huntsmen, Monster), Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus (Thor, 28 Weeks Later) and a mission specialist Logan Marshal-Green (Across the Universe, Devil) all gave some not-so-impressive performances that made me appreciate the Android David (Fassbinder) and the Chief Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) that much more.

I wish it was better. I was hoping it would have been better. But this is a direct to video/DVD or Netflix film. Not worth $12 to $16! Not a lot of substance. Just a lot of special effects!",1339286400,8,3143,4.94876660341556
4799604,5,B005LAIHY0,"The greatest strength - one of many - in ""Prometheus"" is that it is decidedly not another ""Alien"" movie. It's a film that exists entirely in its own framework, only borrowing elements from the series and hinting at things that would happen in other films.

While ""Prometheus"" is clearly a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, I now understand why Ridley Scott has said multiple times that it's not a ""direct prequel"" to the series. It's not like last year's ""The Thing,"" which literally ends to lead into the opening shots of the 1982 classic. ""Prometheus"" sets the stage for ""Alien,"" yes, but it leaves plenty unexplained.

So if you're expecting a retread of Ridley Scott's original monster movie in space, you'll be sorely disappointed. And that's why I think some reviews of the film are coming in so soft.

But what were you really expecting? Even a quick glance over Ridley Scott's filmography shows that he doesn't tread the same ground twice. Even films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" which share a lot of themes and elements, are entirely different movies. Why would anyone expect ""Alien: The Prequel - The Tragic Journey of the Space Jockey""?

At it's heart, ""Prometheus"" is a grand piece of speculative fiction, which opens some thought-provoking doors as to humanity, our beginnings, morality and immortality. It's the story of a scientific vessel traveling to a distant planet to discover our extraterrestrial ancestors. However, upon arrival, the crew finds some terrifying things and uncovers some unpleasant secrets about our origins.

I won't say anything more than that, but rather will let the film sit for itself. Things in ""Prometheus"" need to be revealed by the film, not by trailers, marketing and spoilery reviews. Yes, there are bits and pieces you will recognize from the ""Alien"" universe, but it gives a very different view of that universe.

Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing a bit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough, adorable and complex, and she can be both the victim and the hero. She is supported by a strong cast that includes Charlize Theron as the corporate bigwig driving the mission, Guy Pearce as the aging benefactor and Idris Elba as the overly cliched but still enjoyable pilot.

Still, the star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. (Yes, there's gotta be one of those in every movie, it seems.) Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately, and here's another feather in his cap. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.

""Prometheus"" is best enjoyed is a relative vacuum from the franchise that left Scott's hands more than 30 years ago. It's good to be familiar with the films, but it's best to expect a grand space journey along the lines of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with teeth and less psychedelic drugs. It is not quite what you'll expect, and it's a better film for it.",1339286400,16,3063,4.820952380952381
4799605,5,B005LAIHY0,"I went into this film with no expectations at all, a free and clear mind.  And I can truly say, ""Thank you Ridley Scott.""
Having read quite a few reviews here, Iv'e noticed many lackluster or negative reviews. Well, to each his own. Its been some years that Iv'e gone to a film that has truly blown my mind. Most of Science Fiction today is so poor and embarrasing, that it hurts to watch. This is the return of true Sci-Fi genius and done by a master of the genre.
Some people are saying, ""They didn't explain that"", or ""I don't get it"", or ""that doesn't make sense."" Well, not all films explain everything, and to me, that's a good thing. I was glued to my seat the whole time and my palms were so sweaty, I dropped my pop.
I'm not going to go into a massive rant about the effects, or the plot or the macabre sets. There's plenty of those reviews here.

(Thumbs up to Michael Fassbender who's performance as the android David was extrordinary.)

So my point is basically do what other reviews have said, ""don't expect Oscars"" and go into this with a clear head and forget about ""Alien"". Even though you'll want to watch ""Alien"" as soon as you get home from the theatre.
I want to give this 5 stars but I have to go with my gut and give it 4 and a half stars. Still a remarkable accomplishment.

This is truly unbelievable filmaking and this is what Sci-Fi is all about. Take it for what it is, a spetacular ride from start to finish.

And thanks again Ridley for a truly remarkable film. Cannot wait for ""Blade Runner 2."" And of course, ""Prometheus 2.""",1339286400,15,1555,4.293515358361775
4799606,5,B005LAIHY0,Ridley Scott has made another masterpiece. He has answered a million questions and left us with 10 million more. What a wild adventure. This is pure Sci-Fi narcotic. Forget the popcorn and forget the drink. This is an express elevator to man's ORIGINAL place in the universe. ENJOY !,1339286400,9,283,4.795918367346939
4799607,3,B005LAIHY0,"In this mega-million, 3-D production masterpiece with it's high-paid stars and it's brilliant art direction and sets... (thus my 3 stars)

...the Writing Simply Doesn't Work.

Given the rush to produce and start shooting, however, it's understandable.

Rather than bore anyone with endless dissections, I'll just state for the record the big problems I found with the script (there are many small ones) and the things that require far too much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer:

* The Engineer on the alien ship reacts violently upon awakening. Very illogical for a technologically superior race.

* Shaw's ""baby"" grows to room-size without ingesting any food?

* Human DNA is affected at the molecular level by the alien virus, yet there are tiny whip-like things surfacing in the infected character's eye.

* Shaw doesn't get infected from sexual contact yet is capable of gestating the alien seed from her counterpart with no apparent side-affects.

* The alien ship doesn't have any protection against being rammed by Prometheus.

* The commander of the Prometheus is gone for long stretches, seemingly every time something horrible happens.

and more...

Other than that, I did enjoy the movie from a visual standpoint and it's technological wonders. I felt the beginning was highly compelling as well, but again, only made more questions instead of culminating with any real answer to the recombinant DNA sequence during the intro... How exactly did that connect to the whole? It didn't.

This movie is good sci-fi entertainment, but creates far more questions than necessary. There's no fulfillment at the end, and while that may work perfectly for future sequel$, it doesn't really make this film a good stand-alone product in my opinion.

I recommend it anyway to those who love Ridley Scott, the alien franchise, sci-fi and good thrillers. Bon appetit!",1339286400,7,1879,5.141447368421052
4799608,2,B005LAIHY0,"I never seen any of the previous Aliens movies and as this is the only movie I seen, I must have to said that this movie isn't that good.

My friends invited me to watch this movie because they got free tickets to go watch it and so I watched it with them. I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. Only when I got there my friends told me it was a prequel to Alien, so that's good because I didn't see Alien in the first place, so I'm at a good start in terms of learning about the storyline.

I thought the whole idea of one giant race of beings made us was so stupid. And, how it all started was the group told this one being that he should scarface his life to create the human race was dumb. Then, all he needed to do was to drink some black stuff out of a cup. This would start destroy his cells and then he would drops himself into the waterfall. When that happens all of his DNA will now somehow create human race. The very idea was so stupid.

I only like the graphics and special effects in this movie. All those star maps are very impressive. Also the look of the beings look very real and the aliens too.

What I found stupid was that the main female scientist didn't want to bring weapons into the cave/structure. She said it was a scientific mission and so they didn't need it. What in the hell was she thinking??? She doesn't know what's down in there? Is she thinking they can reason with whatever hostile inside? Well, that's usually not going to happen. Look, they are the invaders and for them to go somewhere totally new like this, 90% of the time, it doesn't turn out good. And, they're not just going to a new place, they're going to a whole new planet! Dumbest move ever made!

What even proved main point even further was when, they actually meet the creator. They waked him from hyper sleep and not even 1 minute into the conversation were they all died!!! Anyone that was surprised by that must be on the same page as the stupid scientist. Also, only one person had a flame thrower? Oh come on??? Really??? They should had all had 1 weapon at least, but they thought they could just ""reason with him"". NO WAY!!!

Again, they are the invaders and they don't know what they're going to find. Most likely, it's not going to be good when they meet with whatever down there. The only time, the female scientist ever thought she needed a weapon was after she got back to her small safe pod that rip from the main ship. Then, she hears a noise. So, she gets a weapon? What in the world??? She now thinks she can defect whatever she finds inside. Anyone else would had picked up a weapon and ran for the hills, but no. Not her. She got an axe and now she thinks she can go find it and kill whatever inside. Dumb move and dumber moves.

This movie is below average in terms of story and common sense. My friends told me it gave them even more questions than answers and so it was worse for them than me. If I had watched the other aliens movie, I'll probably give this movie a 1 star!!!

But, they lucked out and I gave it a 2 stars just because I don't know much than what I saw. But, what I saw wasn't exactly, the best I have ever seen. I've seen way better other alien type movies with better story plots and things that actually made more sense. If I were to pay to see this movie, I would had wanted my money back!!!",1339286400,3,3352,4.162037037037037
4799609,5,B005LAIHY0,"Since the very first teaser was released, even before realizing this movie had anything to do with Alien, I couldn't wait to see it. I'm glad to say the wait was totally worth it; for such a long film, there wasn't a single dull moment. I don't understand how anyone, especially fans of Alien, could dislike Prometheus. With an engaging setting, memorable characters, and moments that leave you wondering what will happen next, it's a marvelous movie that holds its own against other sci-fi greats.

Prior to watching Prometheus I had never seen the Alien films, but immediately afterwards I proceeded to watch Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 back-to-back. Let me tell you, having the chance to see the prequel first made watching this trio that much more enjoyable for me.

I truly hope this film gets the sequel(s) it deserves; I will definitely be catching it in RealD at least once more before it leaves theaters and can't wait for the 3D Blu-ray release.",1339286400,8,954,4.775757575757575
4799610,5,B005LAIHY0,This is the best alien related movie made since aliens. I am not too hard on these movies i even like alien 3. I thought it had a creepy feel to it and the visuals were great. The plot was also very interesting and i really hope there is a sequel to this to show how the aliens evolved further.,1339286400,13,294,3.9166666666666665
4799611,5,B005LAIHY0,"Okay, so first off I rarely give a movie 5 stars. To me that means it's as near perfect as a film can be. This one definitely makes the case. I won't go over what everyone else is saying about how well designed, shot & acted this is because pretty much everyone agrees on that. What I have noticed is many critics are saying there are too many questions left unanswered and it's too open ended. Well, Blade Runner got the same sort comments from critics (far worse actually) and after people sat with it for a while they realized it was a masterpiece. This is another one of those movies. So, since this movie does not tell you how Ripley's ship came to find a giant derelict on a distant planet (and why should it?) there are two big questions are left open to discussion, one is answered and one is not: SPOILERS START HERE: #1: Why did the ""Engineers"" make us? and #2: Why did they decide to end us?. #1 is a question that's really something that should be left open in my opinion. You don't do a movie telling us the purpose of life. That's preachy in my opinion. That's what faith is about. And though it's discussed quite a bit Ridley Scott is not making this movie to tell you if God exists and if so why did he make us. What it is doing is showing the power of faith & reason and how science and religion can co-exist. Big stuff for a summer movie blockbuster. #2 is actually answered in the film, just not expressively so. Why did they decide to send these bio-warfare ships to earth and destroy us? Well, it's all in the title my friends. We (the human race) began to use 'fire' in ways that were a threat to the ""Engineers"". They are themselves a violent race so it's not that they thought, ""oh these humans are being bad, we've got to stop them from hurting themselves"". No it's, ""these humans are getting really good at making war and and someday they'll be able to kill us"" (remember David's line: ""Everyone wants to kill their parents""). And since we were genetic replicas of the Engineers they knew we'd someday be capable of creating faster than light technology and they knew there were signs all over the earth of where they came from..or is it where they were making the weapons to destroy us (back up plan maybe?). So they took measures to do the job by designing these parasitic life forms that would be really good at killing humans and possibly take our place on Earth. Again, David (who had the whole thing figured out) tells us ""sometimes you have to destroy before you can create"". Remember, as soon as the humans got into the chamber with all of the canisters that goo starting coming out. Talk about a smart bomb!  And a big clue is the carbon dating on the Engineer's body, about 3 thousand years ago they were getting ready to launch their mission to earth. In the movie's time that would be oh say around O B.C. when the Romans were conquering everyone and everything and Jesus came along to show us another way. As we all know things didn't work out too well. Riddley Scott even suggested in a recent interview with movies.com that maybe Jesus was the last ambassador to get us to change our ways. And of course, he was crucified. I bet Fox asked him to leave that one out of the film for obvious reason.
I guess there is one other big question that's left open, where do the Xenomorphs (original aliens) fit in to all this? Well the last shot of the movie shows the beginning of that race. Obviously related and another form of bio warefare but not quite the same.

So, in short there are lots of great questions and lots of great clues. An entertaining movie that makes you really think which is all too rare these days.  If you're looking for a movie to spell it all out for you this isn't for you. But it is a perfect example of what good sci-fi is supposed to be. Asking the big questions in an entertaining way and in the case of Prometheus, scaring the hell out of you in the process.",1339286400,12,3924,4.336054421768708
4799612,4,B005LAIHY0,"its a good quality movie, fills in plenty of holes but opens up many other unexplained for maybe part 2?
good flick for the sci fi fan",1339286400,5,134,4.0
4799773,5,B005LAIHY0,"For those naysayers out there, including many professional critics, I think you all missed the boat on this one.  No doubt there are connections between the Prometheus and Alien universes, but if you were looking for a real ""Alien"" prequel, you're looking in the wrong place.  This film had its frightening moments, but it was not billed as a fright fest a la ""Alien"" or any of the other films in that series.  For those of you that were young enough to remember, ""Alien"" received average reviews by top critics when it was released.  Don't go by the 97% on Rotten Tomatoes - most of those reviews were written and compiled years later when ""Alien"" became a classic - deservedly so.

""Prometheus"" is far more cerebral than any of those films.  The story is based more in philosophy and religion than horror.  It is intelligent sci-fi at its finest, with a great story which mainly stood apart from ""Alien"".  Yes, the Weyland Corporation figured prominently here (later in the ""Alien"" series as ""Weyland-Yutani"" - M&A still happens in the distant future, ha ha).  But this is a different story.

Were there plot holes?  Perhaps, but there were plenty of those in Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", considered by many to be the pinnacle of science fiction movies.  Was Decker human or not?  Who cares.  Blade Runner turned out to be a classic.  So will this film.  Plot holes here can allow for interpretation as well, so don't get caught up in that baloney.

IF you haven't seen it, get Alien, Aliens or any of its successors out of your mind.  If you do that, you will enjoy this film more.  Don't get caught up in the comparisons, or how one film is scarier than the other, etc.  Just sit back and enjoy it.  Beautifully filmed, great performances (Noomi Rapace will become a household name beyond her native Sweden) and a killer soundtrack.  And probably the best use of 3D I have seen to date.

Ridley has done it again.  A sci-fi masterpiece.",1339286400,38,1942,4.627565982404692
4799774,3,B005LAIHY0,"A starship with an improbably disfunctional crew and poorly defined chain of command is sent to a planet to find the creators of humankind. Well, I wish that the premise itself could have been improved upon- the fossil evidence related to human evolution is overwhelming and thus the idea that we are created by advanced humanoids is a bit ridiculous. I think a much better plot device could have been created. Apparently the Engineers were using a  moon of a gas giant as a bioweapons lab and something went wrong and the facility was destroyed by by the bioweapons. Prometheus's crew is entirely disfunctional and different teams have competing , or at leats non-aligned , agendas, dooming the mission from the start, in all reality.(This is another aspect of the plot which requires the suspension of belief on the part of the viewer. ) The Engineers were apparently about to seed Earth with a bio-weapon (which we know of as ""The Alien"") to eliminate humankind (I guess we didn't turn out well enough) when their progeny escaped and destroyed their creators. One Engineer is found in stasis by the Prometheus's android and awoken and then he tries to complete his mission and the Prometheus rams the alien spaceship and both are destroyed. It's hard to imagine that a civilization of the Engineers technological level would not have a way to destroy the Prometheus before it hits the alien ship. At the end, the lone human survivor of the Prometheus heads off in another Engineer starship on a searxch for their home planet- could make an interesting sequel, I suppose.

While the plot was bit disappointing I liked the production design and how everything more or less fit in with the first Alien movie. For example, the alien we see in the big room in the first movie, sitting in some kind of hgiant chair with its chest burst open, is simply another Engineer which was infected with an Alien and died while trying to launch his craft. The Alien ship is spectacular- you have to wonder about the technology needed to create sush a vessel and you forget for a few moments that it's just a movie. (At least I did.)

I give it three stars- it was good but should have been a lot better.",1339286400,3,2189,4.66580310880829
4799775,5,B005LAIHY0,"I'm not going to go on and on in my review, but I do consider myself a big fan of the Alien franchise, with Aliens being one of my all time favorite movies.  I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie but I will say now that I loved it and I think it is just what the franchise needs to save it from the ridiculous Alien: Erection film and the AvP films (although the predator/alien fight scene in AvP 1 was pretty bad @$$)!

They did a much better job on choosing actors this time compared to the above mentioned films in the series and I think Noomi Rapace was a great choice for the main.  Like the other reviewers have said, they do some stupid things sometimes...like wanting to pet what looks like some kind of a lethal alien snake, but overall, they're good!

It has a controversial plot.  I loved it!  But I think it will anger the atheist crowd somewhat as the main actor still believes in God nearly 100 years from now.  This shouldn't be a reason to give the movie a 1 star rating.  And it may anger the Christians a bit by saying an alien race created us (I'm a bit of a skeptic/humanist/ancient astronaut theory kinda guy myself).

The special effects are bad @$$!  The lighting/sets/costumes/ships and especially the storms are all done great!

I was thinking we would see the ""alien"" a bit more but this movie's intention was to tell us more about the ""space jockey"" (although I hate that nickname) and after watching it last night, I'm glad they made it the way they did!  The ending left a lot of questions unanswered and undoubtedly left it open for part 2.  Hopefully we'll be able to find out what happens next very soon.

With that said, disregard the minor controversy and if you're an Alien fan or not, its a must see!",1339286400,9,1749,4.325153374233129
4799776,4,B005LAIHY0,"Many have described Prometheus as Ridley Scott's attempt to take Alien to the level of Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001, and I think that's broadly a good assessment. However, while I found the film enjoyable, it never quite reaches the heights of either of its spiritual predecessors.

MINOR SPOILERS BELOW

When I first heard about the concept of aliens creating men, I was worried. However, it's important not to take the science in the film too seriously. Even Ridley Scott says this isn't a science class. It is kind of silly that these large humanoid aliens called the ""Engineers"" (or Space Jockeys for fans of the original Alien) created humans. The film even points out the ridiculousness of the concept when the biologist jokes it would throw out ""300 years of Darwinism."" In watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the plot is a device to answer philosophical questions about the nature of God, creation, and death. The atmosphere and story during the first half of the movie is great.

The acting is also surprisingly good. Other reviewers have gone on about how good the big three - Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron - are, so all I'll say is that I really enjoyed their performances. Fassbender's performance as the android is stunning in how calmly chilling he is. Some of his lines were so cruel, yet so innocently recited, that I want to rematch the movie just to see him. Most of the other characters I thought were fine, with some exceptions (particularly Noomi Rapace's character's husband who came off as a lame Ashton Kutcher wannabe).

The problem with the movie is that its exploration of these themes and acting are hampered by action/horror scenes that clearly weren't well thought out. As other reviewers noted, many of the deaths are caused by characters making stupid decisions. Many reviewers have criticized the crew for taking off their helmets, which at first is fine because one would expect that alien microbes would not be able to infect humans. However, once it was apparent that the Space Jockey DNA was the same as humans AND that one of the crew members was infected, they still continue to take their helmets off! Other stupid decisions include the biologist's attempt to pet a snake; the captain's decision to open the ship's door when a crew member's signal is detected without receiving audio confirmation from him; and the fact that the characters can only run straight to avoid a rolling ship. Overall, the action scenes seem like they were a symptom of today's brain dead Hollywood.

For me, the biggest drawback to the movie was pacing. The beginning was slow, which was fine by me. However, when the action starts, it never really slows down. The audience isn't given time to breathe and absorb. The tension never really builds. For example, after Noomi Rapace's infamous scene, she runs down the hallways and has a conversation with the crew, and then they go try to communicate with the Space Jockeys. First of all, the fact that Rapace's character doesn't even inform the other crew members about what happened to her is ridiculous. But then the movie switches gears so quickly that it's like it never happened. Rapace's character is clearly hurting from the encounter, but not as much as she probably would in real life.

Another major problem is that the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I'm not an Alien fanboy - I don't need to know every detail about the Space Jockey's origins. However, major plot points that are (deliberately) left open, setting it up for a sequel. I like some mystery, but for most viewers the movie will seem incomplete or ridiculous. For example, as many other reviewers have noted, it seems pretty stupid for one of the Space Jockey's, presumably an intelligent alien species, to simply start killing humans, arguably an intelligent species, when he wakes up after sleeping for 2,000 years. The film hints that there might be a reason why the Space Jockeys hate humans so much, but you'd think he would at least be confused at seeing humans or worried that they were able to travel so far. As it is the Space Jockey's actions look more like Hollywood's attempt to throw in some mindless violence. Maybe it'll all make sense after we see the inevitable sequel, but too much of it just doesn't seem to have been thought through very clearly.

Overall, if you like sci-fi, especially the Alien franchise, Prometheus is well worth seeing. Don't set your expectations too high, and be willing to accept some thoughtless plot points. I'd give the movie 3 stars. If Ridley Scott and his scriptwriters had put a bit more thought into the plot, it could have been so much more.

UPDATE on Blu-Ray (10/15/12):

My initial review was a bit harsh, but upon rewatching the movie I think it was eminently justified. While there are some interesting philosophical concepts, they're buried deep beneath stupid characters and poor scriptwriting. The contrast with Scott's Alien, which I also recently rewatched, is telling. Alien never pulled me out of the movie and the characters seemed utterly believable. It's just a shame Prometheus didn't quite work on that level.

The blu-ray set comes with all the standard deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and commentaries. The deleted scenes are definitely the highlight. As happens so often, I wonder why they were deleted. The deleted version of the Fiefield fight uses a much more interesting Fiefield monster concept than the ugly guy we saw in the film. Also, Vickers has a few compelling character moments in the deleted scenes. Even the Engineer has more character. The deleted scene gives him a very compelling reason for attacking the Promtheus crew, whereas in the finished film he seems like a mindless brute. In short, Prometheus would have been a much better movie with these scenes incorporated.

The 4-disc set comes with even more impressive special features, particularly the 3-hour ""The Furious Gods"". This is the documentary that the ads claim will ""answer"" the questions left from the film's plot holes. While that goes a bit too far, ""The Furious Gods"" is rich in content. I enjoyed hearing about the making of the movie, from beginning to end. It is definitely revealing, both in good ways and bad, However, I really don't like the idea of ""enhancement pods"", which essentially require you to interrupt the documentary in order to watch shorter featurettes. I'd have preferred if the short featurettes were simply part of the feature documentary.",1339286400,13,6527,4.924545454545455

4799778,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prequels to extremely popular films rarely turn out well.  By and large, they're not great, and only occasionally good.  Even rarer is a prequel that is just as good as the originals...but ""Prometheus"" is not one of them.  It gets so tantalizingly close to reaching that coveted rank, but just misses it.

In the near future, a group of scientists travel to a distant planet for the scientific expedition of a lifetime: the chance to learn exactly where humans came from, and the chance to meet with our creators.  But upon arriving, they quickly learn that they may have discovered something that will lead to humanity's end.

In many ways, ""Prometheus"" is an excellent film: its basic concept (what if humans were created by aliens and we could go and meet them?) is fantastic; the atmosphere and visuals are top notch, and when the film hits it's stride, it's an undeniable masterpiece, especially during the first half, where there's a constant sense of exploration and adventure, of finding new things and getting closer and closer to a coveted goal.  ""Prometheus"" functions as a prequel to 1979's, ""Alien"" and although events in this film do not lead into the original, there are numerous winks and nods towards what has come before, which are a delight for fans of the Xenomorph creature.  I especially loved learning more about the so called, ""Space Jockey"" creature that was seen in the original, and learning more about it's species, which arguably makes for the most engaging moments in the film.

Sadly however, while ""Prometheus"" is more often then not, a fascinating film, it makes some huge blunders along the way.  The pacing in the second half of the second act unexpectedly ratchets up from slow paced to breakneck, with things happening so fast it's easy to loose track of what's going on, especially with regards to the characters (of which there are too many), and why they act the way they do; for a bunch of scientists, they make some really stupid decisions (look!  An alien life form!  Let's try to pick it up when it's clearly angry at us!) and do really bizarre things (one character, after going through a rather horrific act, goes back to wandering around the ship/exploring without bothering to tell anyone what happened, which bugs me to no end).  David the android, in particular, while fascinating to watch, lacks the simple, effective characterization that Ash and Bishop had; he does things seemingly out of random, and even two days after seeing the film, I'm still trying to figure out his motivations.

The editing also adds to the frustration, as I got the sense that a lot was cut out of the finished film, as the rushed pace feels like a lot was cut out to save on the running time.  But worst of all is the feeling of not getting any closure. ""Prometheus"" raises questions it has no intention of answering, and with the ending hinting towards a sequel, the movie feels frustratingly incomplete, rather then a stand-alone film.

While ""Prometheus"" comes so tantalizingly close to being a perfect film, it's incomplete feeling, breakneck speed, and choppy editing pull it down (though the third act does manage to recover, and ends with a rather spectacular finale).  It's a great movie, and when it worked, I was more absorbed in it then any other film in recent memory, but I was left with the maddening feeling that it could have crossed the threshold into classic territory if it had been a little more focused and tightened up.  Still, for what it is, it's a great ride for anyone who's ever wondered if we owe our existence to beings beyond the stars.",1339286400,5,3597,4.774193548387097
4799779,5,B005LAIHY0,"Seen Prometheus three times now. Each time enjoy it more. I have always wanted to know the back story of the Engineers and this film starts to clarify this. I also love the interior of the derelict ship from Alien and Giger's imagination of the egg silo,cockpit and corridors and alien life. Real atmosphere and scary as hell.
I love Alien and always cared about the Space Jockey/Engineer,this film addresses this and pays its respect to Swiss genius HR Giger. The father of Xenomorphs. Also get to see the Derelict ship in all its glory. Something like an Alien Titanic?
This film explains mans' origins and has a believable and plausible story to it. The special fx are superior to Avatar and not Disney/alice in wonderland mentality with humans being enemy of decency. If the Engineers got their hands  on Navi they'd rip out their limbs easily and be no contest. They and their technology superior to all terrestial beings.
I don't like Damon Lindelof,his contribution to the script is interracial relationships like in Star Trek and Prometheus eg Captain Kirk with Uhura and Vickers with Janek,this is evolution for us mortals on Earth?Perhaps that is why space jockeys came to Earth to destroy everybody. God created separate races,man tries to mix them. According to him ,Lindelof,.evolution is destroying your racial identity with mixed offspring. This seems to be the mentality of Hollywood.
If you are wanting to relive Aliens,forget this film. If you are a fan of original Alien and Ridley Scott fan,then this film should sate your appetite. Every franchise is promoting white alpha males/females with black male/female partners.
Prometheus could do with more length to film,but hopefully sequel done by Scott with no Lindelof can hopefully fulfil this small complaint.

4799857,5,B005LAIHY0,"If asked what my favorite ""type"" of movie is, I'm apt to respond science fiction.  Yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection.  The fact is that they are rarely done well.  Having said that, a few rank high on my favorites list.  Two were directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"").  Scott's ""Prometheus"" will join that list.  It is no secret at this point, but this film is a prequel of sorts to ""Alien.""  Not that there is a direct linkage, but as Scott says there's common DNA.  Indeed human DNA is a source for this story.

Numerous discovered cave art from across Earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life.  Two prominent scientists, who happened to also be romantically attached, are hired by Wayland Corp. (also from ""Alien"") to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility.  Wayland's representative on the trip is a stone-faced Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron, reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  As in all the ""Alien"" films the corporate representatives are never there to help.

Other key characters include scientist Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a true evolutionist and God-fearing girlfriend scientist, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace (""The Girl Who Played With Fire"") in another memorable performance.  The other performance to watch is the amazing Michael Fassbender (""Haywire"") as the android called David.  In an early scene check out how David acquires his ""personality.""  He emulates blond Peter O'Toole from his favorite movie, ""Lawrence of Arabia.""

Ridley Scott's return to the franchise allows him to follow-up on the neglected sequence when the ""Space Jockey"" is found in the original film.  Who was he?  What was he after?  How did he die?  Where did he come from?  Some questions are answered.  Some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to ""Alien.""  Scott, who always seems to direct films with strong female leads, makes no exception here.  Rapace's Dr. Shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ship's crew, aided by Captain Janek (Idris Elba).  She even undergoes a self-directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat.

There are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship (Prometheus), the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word, magnificent.  I saw this movie in 3-D and it looks great.  There are few, if any, in-your-face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent.  The 3-D adds depth to many of the shots and doesn't darken the picture.  Ultimately, the film doesn't answer all the questions, but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas.  More please.

BLU RAY UPDATE (10-11-12):  I wasn't surprised to find this Blu ray transfer to be near perfect.  Since I don't have 3-D at home yet I opted for the Blu ray/DVD/Digital copy version.  The video is in 1080p as you would expect and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release.  Lighting is a major factor in the film.  It is dark (takes place in space) so director Scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity.  The transfer looks beautiful. Stunning.  Gorgeous. Spectacular.  Detail is excellent.

The audio is likewise perfect.  The prime track to sample is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you have a properly set up rig, this soundtrack will knock your socks off.  The subs and woofers will get a workout, but none of the small sounds are missed either.  The great orchestral score washes over the entire picture.  Optional audio includes Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks with Enlish descriptive, Spanish, and French.

There are plenty of interesting special features as well.  Audio commentaries are provided by director/producer Ridley Scott and another by writer John Spaihts and writer/executive producer Damon Lindelof.  There are 14 deleted/extended/alternate scenes that total about 37 minutes.  Finally there is a segment called ""The Peter Weyland Files."" This consists of some video files reflecting some insider info on the fictious Weyland Corp.  Great movie and Blu ray package.",1339200000,26,4291,5.005665722379604
4799858,5,B005LAIHY0,"Who created us?

That is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by mankind and is the driving idea at the center of Ridley Scott's new science-fiction adventure Prometheus, the first entry of a proposed trilogy from the celebrated British director who brought us ALIEN, and Blade Runner. This story detailing a possible origin of mankind follows journey of a research team traveling in a spaceship years away from home in search of their creators. Prometheus is a fantastic looking movie set in the same fictional universe as Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic ALIEN (1979) and uses the mythology suggested by Dan O'Bannon's original script to fashion an entirely new sci-fi adventure.

Prometheus is the name of a trillion dollar research vessel created by Weyland Industries. A science team along with an assorted group of professionals has been recruited to find a planet that has been depicted in numerous cave paintings back on earth. Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, Sweden's original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [2009]) , and her lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshal Green) leads the science team under the critical, cold gaze of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). It takes over two years for the Prometheus to reach LV-223, during which the human crew is watched over by David 8 (Michael Fassbender), a highly advanced robotic organism programmed to simulate human life. Once they arrive on LV-223 they discover a structure left behind by the previous inhabitants. There Shaw and her science team searches for the key to mankind's creation, but instead finds a weapon with the potential of destroying all life on Earth.

The break out character of the movie is Michael Fassbender as David 8. We meet David going about his daily routines while the rest of the crew is asleep in one of the best scenes the movie offers in ways of character development. David eats, watches over the crew, plays basketball by himself, learns new languages, and memorizes lines from his favorite movie, Lawrence of Arabia. Here's how I'd descrive this character: Imagine if HAL9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey could take human form; if you could see him actually grappling and occasionally hinting at signs of having developed genuine emotions. That is David 8.

As Elizabeth Shaw Noomi Rapace's first leading role in an English-language movie begins shaky, but by the end of the movie she's hit her stride, bringing Elizabeth Shaw to life. Her performance lacks the subtle nuance of her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it does pack a punch. By the end of the film she does firmly step into her action heroine shoes.

A character I liked that not many people talk about as much is the Prometheus's Captain Janek, an underutilized character who had more potential than the movie allowed him. He starts off as an outsider to the worlds of Shaw, Vickers ,and the expedition, but by the end has completely devoted himself to it.

Ridley Scott's stylish direction played a huge part in cementing ALIEN and Blade Runner as two of the movie world's science-fiction masterpieces and there is no doubt that Prometheus is a great looking movie. When Ridley Scott does science-fiction he knows how to make it look right, and that still holds true thirty years after Blade Runner. The full-scale sets are fantastic, there are plenty of great special effects. You shouldn't wait to see this movie on your home television: it needs to be seen on a big screen.

That brings me to 3D. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and it is one of the best movies I've seen in 3D...That being said I still fail to see why on earth anyone cares about 3D. I've given Coraline, Avatar, TRON: Legacy, Hugo, and Prometheus a fair chance to dazzle me with this recent development in price raising- I mean exciting technology. These are some of the best movies to see 3D in, and yes they look good, but all of them I've also enjoyed just as much, if not better in 2D. If you really are obsessed with 3D then yes, knock yourself out, you're going to have a blast. But, if you're like me and still aren't sold on 3D this movie will not be an eye opener.

The most important thing one needs to understand before sitting down for Ridley Scott's Prometheus: this is NOT an Alien movie. It takes place in the same universe as Alien, has visual elements of Alien, has locations and even the fledgling evolutionary stage of what will become the monsters of the 1979 classic, but alone Prometheus is not a straight-up ALIEN prequel. Prometheus is a standalone science-fiction adventure, and it is one that in my humble opinion works extraordinarily well. Ridley Scott announced he intends Prometheus to be the first part of a science-fiction trilogy set within the Alien universe. That means you should expect H.R. Giger's infamous monsters to be leaping around. This movie is about the creation of man, with the creation of what ultimately becomes the xenomorphs by the time the Nostromo arrives at LV-426 in the first Alien movie.

Do not go into Prometheus expecting a direct ALIEN prequel.

I feel I need to clarify that Prometheus is not an Alien movie because too many disappointed, annoyed, or downright angered reviewers are coming down hard on Prometheus for not filling the shows, or delivering the same goods of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic. To go in expecting another Alien movie would be to set yourself up for disappointment. This is Prometheus, part 1 of a new science fiction trilogy. It is not Ridley Scott's ALIEN 2 Electric Boogaloo.

At times Prometheus is a bit in over its head with the scope of its ambition, but at the same time I love this idea of searching for a possible extra-terrestrial root to man's DNA. Sure, the plot has been done several times in books, but only a few times in movies, and I honestly feel Prometheus has done a better job of it than does other films.

Prometheus isn't ALIEN but it is a damn good first step for what could be a great new series. For what it's worth: I loved Prometheus. Even with its flaws.

Here's to the hopes of a brilliant trilogy from Sir Ridley Scott!",1339200000,15,6122,4.775047258979206
4799859,4,B005LAIHY0,"PROMETHEUS may be a prequel to ALIEN, but fixating too much on making those connections will probably sabotage your overall enjoyment of the film. After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.

In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.

Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.

Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.

The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser ""company man"" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.

I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition come off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture. I wish it were better.",1339200000,22,5049,5.1750305997552015
4799860,3,B005LAIHY0,I just saw the film about 3 hours ago. I was some what disapointed in the film. It started off slow and then about the last 30 minutes it was good. I expected so much more from this long awaited film. If you liked alien 3 then you will love this. What I mean is >>>>>>>>>Boring>>>>>>>!!!!!,1339200000,2,289,4.178571428571429
4799861,1,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" is a prequel to the great classic sci fi film ""Alien"" (1979). It sets out to explain what the spaceship was doing, who was the big guy in the driving seat, and what the alien creatures were designed for. The film does a pretty job in these objectives, but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. This film is so bad I hardly know where to begin. But here goes...

* Guy Pearce appears as an old man in makeup. The old man looks like Guy Pearce in old man makeup. Surely with a plethora of old men who are excellent actors (Mickey Rooney, Ernie Borgnine, Peter O'Toole), one of them might have been chosen. Or if the writers and producers had some real imagination, how about an old woman?

* If it hadn't been for ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", I could say that this was Charlize Theron's worst performance to date. She is simply terrible. This very talented actress has shown what she can do, but none of it is apparent here.

* One of the chief virtues of ""Alien"" and its sequels was the dark foreboding, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The brightness of this film is a stark contrast.

* For a space ship on a 2 year mission to explore an alien environment, there is a stunning lack of military preparedness. Surely at the end of the 21st Century we have more lethal weapons at our disposal than a shotgun, 2 flame throwers, and a few .45 handguns.

* For a group of so-called scientists, most of the participants act in a very unscientific manner and take chances that are unacceptable. Of course this gives us the drama we are looking for, but a more clever film would not have it originate in the unscientific behavior of the scientists. For example, in the late 21st Century why are they walking without their helmets on into this unknown environment prior to the mapping technology completing the task. And where are the remote probes which exist in 2012 and by the end of the century will surely be more advanced?

SPOILER ALERTS (if it's possible to ""spoil"" a terrible film)

* There are many incredulous plot flaws. For example, the giant alien walks from his crashed space ship through the poisonous atmosphere to confront Dr. Shaw. But it's already been established that he can only breathe in the ""earth-like"" atmosphere in the cave; otherwise he needs a space suit which he leaves behind. How did he do it? Did he hold his breath? Think how big his ship was. How long would it take him to go from his gigantic ship to the survival vessel? How would he even know there was a survival vessel and where it was? etc.

* Since the earth spaceship is equipped with a robotic medical center, why would the center be configured only for male patients, especially when Weyland's own daughter is aboard?

* It's also been established in ""Alien"" that the big guy died in the command seat in his spaceship. So if he died elsewhere, who was in the seat? It was established that everyone else was dead. Or maybe there was another spaceship also with a giant engineer guiding it also equipped with alien creatures that also crashed? Yeah, maybe!

* The robot chooses to kill Dr. Holloway by putting some alien substance in his drink, but there is no rationale for this since the robot's mission is to help Dr. Weyland meet the ""engineers"". Killing Dr. Holloway does not advance this agenda and in fact puts the mission at some peril since Holloway is a valued member of the crew.

* As a prequel to ""Aliens"" there is an abominable discontinuation between that film and this one.  For example, there is a vast difference between the means of impregnation in this film (a gigantic creature) and the impregnation in ""Aliens"". What comes out is also vastly different.

* If the start of the film is accurate, the alien engineers have enormous technological capabilities. They create the humans in our world with exquisite engineering. So why would they be wasting their time with the type of killing machine which the alien creature represents?

The film isn't completely worthless and there are some nice touches here and there, like the sterile Shaw getting pregnant with an alien, or the mapping technology. But these are few and far between.

Given the talent and resources that went into making this film, it's a big disappointment.",1339200000,13,4245,4.611405835543766

The 2092 A.D. era date of ""Prometheus"" contradict the early 21st century era date of the ""AVP or Alien vs. Predator"" franchise in which the ""bipedal, back pipes"" aliens already existed in the human/Earth present and there ancient history! ""Prometheus"" was a 3 out of 5 stars movie rating to me because of the era dates contradiction of the ""bipedal, back pipes"" alien's origin (no historical background continuity) between all the varied film's franchise!",1339200000,4,845,5.450381679389313

This is a multi-dimensional film that had me asking during the screening, ""What precisely does that mean?"" and ""How does that tie in with what we saw before?"". Some of those questions were answered, some not.

I guess if there are any open issues or mysteries remaining in a film some people feel let down and pan the movie. I don't need every answer handed to me in order to enjoy a really entertaining film. And the ending does mesh almost perfectly with the beginning of ""Alien"".

The characters were great the development of the characters was great, the story was intriguing, and the visuals were amazing. Whats not to like? I'm sure we all have our opinions and what not but honestly I can't think of a sci-fi film that lived up to what Prometheus did. The scale of Prometheus was epic, yet it still gave us good performances and a good story, rather then being all style no substance. Which is funny because some people have argued that Prometheus is indeed style with no substance.......I guess I watched a different movie....",1339200000,8,616,4.766355140186916

4799936,4,B005LAIHY0,"I have never been so excited for a movie in recent memory.  I am a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise (except the 4th movie and the AvP series).  I have the graphic novels, I have toy models, I have books, etc.  On that 7th of June I had told my wife that if she did not find a babysitter I would watch that movie with or without her.  I explained that the excitement for this movie pre-dated her and that nothing would prevent me from seeing it at midnight.  I turned my back on over 200 dollars in overtime and inpatiently awaited 0000 hrs (military).  I never drink but that night I took my wife out and we had a few drinks as a celebration to my straight up nerdiness.  0000 hrs. approached, I put on my 3D IMAX glasses and........

2 hours later it was over. Everybody got up, my wife lay there asleep on my shoulder (she's a trooper), and I looked over to my buddy (also an Alien fan).  We both still had our glasses on but both could see each other's disappointed face.  We got up and I think the only think we said to each other was ""it was alright i guess.""

It did not stop there.  The following day I could not stop thinking about it.  The movie was said to be a film set in the Alien universe, but that's it.  Ridley Scott was not kidding when he said this.  I refused to believe Ridley Scott, hoping he was going to surprise us.  That is where the problem began.  I went into the film refusing to believe the director's warning/advice as to the prequel issue.  When the credits rolled my initial reaction was ""WTF....NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!.""  The next day I went out and upgraded to the Blu-ray Alien collection (yes I know, a real fan should've had it already.  But I have a family on a Police Officer's salary).  I watched the films and just sat there and analyzed Prometheus over and over.  I came to realization that the movie had left me in awe.  The initial reactions was that of anger that there was no Aliens of Facehuggers.  After that wore off I began to think of it as a Science Fiction film that takes place in the Alien universe, just like we (Alien fans) have been instructed to do so by the director himself.  I am actually excited for future sequels now.  One thing that I do wish for is an extended editiion Blu-Ray, as the film does seem poorly edited at times.  The film has a strange eerie qality to it.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous.  On IMAX 3D it absolutely leaves your jaw on the floor.

This isn't really a straight up review. It's more like a warning to anybody that has not seen it and is expecting an Alien prequel.  So far, everybody I have talked to has experienced the same range of emotions I have.  If you are one of the ones who is going to watch it because the previews ""looked cool"" you will probably want your money back.

Here are some of my favorite science fiction films.  If any of these films are on your list then this film is for you:

*Blade Runner
*Alien
*Aliens
*Alien 3 (had a similar disappointing response initally, only recently have I grown to appreciate this film)
*2001 A Space Odyssey
*The Thing
*District 9",1339200000,7,3071,4.281739130434783
4799937,1,B005LAIHY0,"This hugely anticipated film was attended by me and my family that range in age from teens through 70s.  After a very long discussion at lunch, none of us felt we were satisfied and we agreed the story was convoluted and ineptly told.  So many unanswered questions and so many dumb scenes and situations that seemed contrived or exploitive and in no way touched on the very big issues that were hinted at.

We're all educated and we love movies of all kinds.  We discussed the hints of pagan and Christian mythology as well as possible source material for the story (such as it was) on screen.  Was it lifted from Ray Bradbury's poem ""Christus Apollo""?  And why does it have an eerie resemblance to a ""Dr. Who"" episode that includes a Dr Shaw character, Prometheus and a big element of one of the apparent central themes?

That said, Noomi Repace was excellent and so was Michael Fassbender as an android.  The visuals were of course cutting edge as in all of Ridley Scott's films.  But that's not enough for a satisfying movie experience.  This near debacle of a movie does not even come close to ALIEN.  The whole enterprise was either not thought out enough or way over-thought.  Or it was just a quick way to make a buck.  Too bad.  So sad.  It could have been stupendously magnificent.",1339200000,25,1290,4.547826086956522
4799938,3,B005LAIHY0,"The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.

Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant ""galactic system"" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that ""ancient"" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.

In this ""2091: A Space Odyssey"" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his ""creator."" Noomi  Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, ""Noomi"" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer ""Star Wars"" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.

The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of ""click"" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.

Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!

Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... ""These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, ""Why did you create us?""....

SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the ""creators"" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.

Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks. This would easy have been a 5 star movie had the writers did their homework. BTW, I just removed my own appendix, I am going out now to do some dirt biking.",1339200000,,2761,4.508
4799939,1,B005LAIHY0,"Saw the movie again, the Zionist overtones made me see it again to re-access my view of the film since the last scene left me with a bad taste, ""this is Elizabeth Shaw signing off in the year of OUR LORD"" blah blah whatever. After watching it again, references to the holocaust, focussing on her christian faith over and over, demanding her crucifix back etc. I now hate the movie completely as a British Zionist propaganda film. There is no room for Zionism in any science fiction film for me. I have lost almost all respect for Ridley Scott, the film Alien and Prometheus shamelessly rip-off Planet of the Vampires, but pollute a simple science fiction film with pathetic Zionist overtones, and in light of the wars in the middle east this type of holy crusade indoctrination is completely objectionable to me. If Scott had simple left off with a benign neutral statement of the folly of using weapons of mass destruction and them coming back to haunt and destroy their very creators, I'd have thought it a great theme, BUT Scott CHOSE to make the Shaw character blatantly take the stance of a blindly devote christian holy warrior marching off into the unknown, ""in the year of OUR LORD 2098"" or whatever. Huge mistake, and ruined a fine science fiction movie completely. I cannot separate the blatant Zionism from the material as a whole... since Britain is the home of the Zionists and give power to Israel etc.",1339200000,10,1416,4.690763052208835

Also, more importantly the film did answer some of the lingering questions many of us fans had as to the origins of the creature we know as the Alien, it's purpose and the Engineers. Yes, It did also leave some questions, which are already fueling interesting theories online, but that's also part of the magic of story writing for such a well known and loved franchise. The director Ridley Scott said that he's already planning a sequel, so will most likely we'll have to wait in anticipation for some of those questions to get answered, but that's o.k. in my opinion.

4799941,3,B005LAIHY0,"The good: it's nice to get something of the back-story on the Alien franchise.  I appreciate the cast's efforts.  The movie looks very nice in spots, although the humanoid aliens seem rather smaller scale than what was portrayed in the brief glimpses from the first Alien movie.  Very good sound design.  The pacing is OK.  It's a meager list.

The complaints are that the movie abounds with impenetrable character motivations, one-dimensional characters, few real surprises, wooden dialog, and logical holes at every turn.  Regarding the last, if there is one thing that is expected of SciFi is that, within the imagined story and setting, the actions of the characters makes logical sense.  A lot of fairly intelligent people watch this genre and cannot abide by this lack of coherence.

I don't want to go into detail so as to cause spoilers, but when watching this I'm constantly mystified along the lines of, ""For what possible reason did A do such-and-such to B?"", ""Why didn't X happen to B if X happened to A?"",  ""How can A possibly know where B is going so as to warn C"", ""Why does an obviously superior-intelligent A freak out upon meeting a bunch of B?"", ""After apparently thousands of years, why does A immediately want to go to planet B instead of getting a bite to eat first and maybe taking a shower or something?""...etc, etc.

The few action scenes seem pointless and/or gratuitous rather than instrumental to any kind of plot.

We have yet another amazing, scheming robot, yawn.  The actress doing the Ripley thing is definitely giving her all and then some, but it all seems staged and forced compared to Ms. Weaver's grunting, gasping, and straining through similar situations.

Yet, wading through all of this, possibly the worst is being handed a ""hey kiddies, get out another 9 bucks for Prometheus II"" ending, an offense all four prior Alien movies never came close to.

Kudos on making sure that android has head ripped off. Any proper sci-fi film is only worth its' salt if an android has head ripped off. Bigger kudos if the android can still talk after decapitation. Although, I was hoping the android would sing 'Daisy' whilst doing an android jig - so slight disappointment there.

Very positive note: I did discover a great attraction for Meredith ""lick her"" Vickers. She's certainly the best excuse for spending a little extra and seeing movie in 3-D.

Some people are too caught up in criticizing the film to a ridiculous extent and end up giving it a 1 out of 10, which is absolutely insane.  Actually, anything below ""7"" is grossly unjustified. Meanwhile these same people end up giving lousy films like Chernobyl Diaries and Battleship much, much better scores?? These people are just utterly retarded and have absolutely no scarcely detectable amount of ability or talent to discern and recognize a work of brilliance when they see it. They are really abusing their privilege of leaving reviews, which are anything but fair and reasonable.

This is definitely my top favorite of the entire Alien ""franchise"". The story is big, and I appreciate that the film does not try to jam all the answers in one go, but instead opens the door to further possibilities, and the continuation of the theme.

Those who are not familiar with the Alien films, may not apprise and empathize the full scope of all the nuances in the film. However, if you can appreciate an extremely high quality film with a captivating and suspenseful storyline, you will surely enjoy Prometheus.

4800044,3,B005LAIHY0,"First of all, Prometheus is a prequel. It takes place, many years, before the events of Alien.

There are Space Jockeys. What they are and what their intentions seem to be, are partially, explained. By the end of the film, there are still many questions to be answered. Its obvious there is more to be told and revealed in another film.

If you're hoping to see facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs (full-grown Aliens), well, you do get to see some creatures, but none of them are recognizable. In fact, these creatures seem to be early versions of the Aliens or the original creatures that the Aliens came from. These creatures have elements of the Aliens and are no doubt, related.

I don't want to give away the plot, but know the planet and the Jockeys are not the same that are seen in Alien. This is a different planet and these Jockey ships aren't carrying eggs.

Now, people who have seen the film say it lacks character development and the film is overall, disappointing. I agree that the film is a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action, but the action scenes, including a self-surgical procedure scene, are intense.

The cinematography and visual effects are stunning, as well as designs and sets. The production is just fantastic.

The acting is well done, especially, by Michael Fassbender as ""David"", Noomi Rapace as ""Elizabeth Shaw"", and Charlie Theron as ""Meredith Vickers"".

The story/script is kind of frustrating to follow, due to many questions it proposes, but I thought the pacing was ok. It felt like it was quicker than Alien's and that has to do with less character development scenes (which honestly, Alien was rather light on character development).

I understand that people were disappointed that this was not ""Alien"" and I agree, to an extent, but that was  not the intention of Ridley and the writers, to make another Alien film. It's a prequel story that takes place at a much earlier time. There are elements of the franchise, absolutely, but this is it's own prequel story.

For what is, I enjoyed it and can't wait to see the answers in the sequel.

If you read other reviews that are mixed or negative, I just say don't expect ""Alien"". Expect an original prequel story that only asks many questions that will need answers.",1339113600,2,2269,4.748091603053435

4800046,4,B005LAIHY0,"Ridley Scott wanted to make a film that asked big questions but, at the same time, could be tied into the same universe he pioneered for the ""Alien"" franchise. Although flawed ""Prometheus"" does have merit. You can read all the pro (5 star) and con (1 star)reviews to determine the brilliance or stupidity of this film.

I'd argue that eventually ""Prometheus"" may, like ""Blade Runner"", see its reptutation rise with time. Either way, ""Prometheus"" is an often stunning looking film from Scott and, in spite of its narrative flaws (the script does have issues), the larger-than-life production values certainly make the film appear impressive looking.

You're mileage may vary but try and ignore the hype associated with the film and put your expectations aside. If you ignore both you may find the film enjoyable.

The 3D Blu-ray disc looks positively stunning--Scott shows an instinctive feel for 3D--the director uses the process to impress with the gradeur of the film and not as a gimmick. The transfer looks brilliant with deep, inky blacks and an amazing amount of detail evident. During the starmap sequence in particular the 3D effect is positively stunning. Depth is remarkably strong throuhgout the presentation.

The regular Blu-ray also looks stunning BUT some players are having some issues (Sony players for example even with the latest upgrade for firmware)with pixelation and cubing where the image breaks up. Usually this is an issue with the disc itself and I'm going to assume that it is in this case although it would be wise to make sure your firmware is up-to-date.

The 3D four disc edition comes with a DVD of the film in addition to the 3D and 2D Blu presentation. All three discs have the commentary track and there are deleted/alternate scenes (some of which should have been kept in the film despite pacing issues as they explained the behavior of some characters and gave others additional depth).

The fourth disc features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. ""Furious Gods"" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an ""Alien"" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes footage. At three hours it's a massive documentary that is equally as impressive as the film looks.

We also get the ""viral"" videos made of a younger Weyland, information on the production of ""David"" the android and other bits and pieces (including a bit of text that ""suggests"" a link between ""Blade Runner"" and ""Prometheus"" --something that Damon Lindelof had in mind while writing the script but never made explicit).

Although flawed with dumb behavior by characters, plot holes that, in this version, you could fly a spaceship through ""Prometheus"" still manages to be entertaining particularly if you set aside the expectations created by the hype associated with the film.",1339113600,,2995,5.060851926977688
4800047,3,B005LAIHY0,"""Prometheus"" is an ambitious movie -- it wants to answer (in a sci-fi way) the questions that have haunted humanity for eons.

And... it doesn't. This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.

Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.

Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...

""Prometheus"" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).

But despite those flaws.... ""Prometheus"" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.

And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.

You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).

She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.

""Prometheus"" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions. Here's hoping ""Prometheus 2"" is a bit more satisfying.",1339113600,5,3004,5.139344262295082
4800048,5,B005LAIHY0,"This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The ""beginning of time"" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, ""There there, it'll be alright,"" and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.

Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.

Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions ""Prometheus"" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time ""Prometheus"" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting ""Alien"" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to ""Alien,"" but this is more like taking place in the same universe as ""Alien"" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this ""having 'Alien' DNA,"" is extremely accurate.

""Prometheus"" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.

The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. ""Prometheus"" mostly takes place in 2093 while ""Alien"" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.

Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?

""Prometheus"" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during ""Prometheus"" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.

On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. ""Prometheus"" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but ""Prometheus"" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.",1339113600,12,3709,4.662079510703364
4800049,2,B005LAIHY0,Wow I am truley disapointed I'm not going to compare this to the first alien because it truley isn't even in the same universe literally and movie quality wise. But its hard not to because the same director directed the same movies! Impossible to tell though when your watching it.. where to start with this mess first the writing is truly poor really horrible. the characters are truly expendable like you don't care for ANY of them when they get picked off I didn't get sad unlike the first alien that has real dialogue spoken by real people and in this even speaks like they are god when they have a mind set of a 5 year old. I'm fine with leaving open ended questions inception did that but that movie was solid the whole way through this is really anticlimactic and not only does it leave 99.9% questions unanswered it also has a really horrible narritave that has characters doing nonsensicle things and doing things for no reason or not exactly sure why. It is the most incoherent movie I have ever seen almost as bad as pirates of the carribean I have been trying to come up with answers for everything but can't find most of them. But I didn't hate it because the movie is visually dazziling and the 3D is the best I've ever seen and I did enjoy that but I need a solid story or else what's the point.. the writers obviously can't write looking back on what they did previously the script brings all the work and talent of this movie down. Its sad.. this movie is absolutly not scary at all the first alien is actually atmoshperic and creepy not this not at all. I want to blame the writers for making EVERYTHING in this movie incoherent but it comes to ridley scotts fault for excepting it. Ridley has been directing for almost 40 years he should have known this and the movie has bad editing too which brings it down they go from comedy to peoples faces melting off?? This movie would have been perfect with a solid script which I will point out ridley scott is vastly overrated he is a true visual visionary but when it comes to story he has yet to impress me. So that's my thought I still recommend seeing it for the talent envolved but the movie is truly anticlimactic and incoherent and really really dissapointing.. thanks a lot damon lindalof for ruining my hype for this movie and this movie is NOT AN ALIEN PREQUAL,1339113600,10,2333,4.4153132250580045
4800050,5,B005LAIHY0,"Got the first showing of the movie in 3D  at my local theatre today. It was everything I hoped it would be. The scenery, graphics, props, special effects, story line, all were top notch. The 3D was good too. Not the kind where you have objects flying out at you. It made you feel more like you were in the movie.

This movie can stand on it's own for sure but it will make more sense if you've seen the other Alien movies. Some questions are answered and new questions are presented. Nothing against this movie, but don't try to look for a comparison to ""Aliens"". To me Aliens is the best action alien sci-fi movie ever. I wish they could put Aliens in 3D on the movie screen.

I pre-ordered a Blue-Ray disc so I can add it to my Alien collection and enjoy it whenever the urge strikes. I have probably watched Aliens 25 times.",1339113600,11,827,4.254777070063694
4800051,2,B005LAIHY0,"Very disappointing.  Pedestrian goo-fest. Loved Alien, but this was the most-expensive dumbest movie I think I've ever seen. All these supposedly smart characters act like the camping teenagers in B horror flicks. ""Oh, there's breathable air in here on this alien planet?  Let's all take our helmets off...nah, I'm sure there aren't any alien germs or anything...""  ""Yes, I'm the crack biologist hired on this trillion-dollar mission, but let me just touch this writhing alien serpent thing - that's ok, sweetie, just let me touch you..."" ""Say, all those ten-foot-tall humanoids were running away from something that caught them, but we never see anything like that...I'm sure there's nothing to worry about...""

This was to Alien as ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" was to ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Scott always has a couple logical plot holes and inconsistencies in his movies, but this was outrageous; he's gone all Tim Burton, interested in something other than plot and character development.  I can't believe Scott actually stole a major plot element from ""Aliens vs. Predators""!

I'm going to try and pretend that this movie never happened, so as not to undermine the original Alien...",1339113600,13,1192,5.1450777202072535

4800133,5,B005LAIHY0,"brilliantly done, considering the writers had to deal with preexisting material. prequels are hard to do; you already should know when going into this enterprise that you are watching a movie full of ghosts; seeing as there were no human bones or whatnot found in the first ""Alien"" movie. that being said, mr Scott handles a camera like michellangello handled a canvas. the shots were so beautifully done, i found myself wanting to visit the alien planet! the gothic atmosphere was well set-up: it requires a two year hypersleep just to reach the place, and the planet's atmosphere was toxic until you were in the Alien ship, which is one of the last places you wanted to be. so nowhere to run, and no help coming.

you have a set of explorers, the year is 2089 or so, and they are able to convince the trillionare businessman mr weyland (so fans of the franchise should already know there's gonna be a doublecross) to fund an exploration to find the aliens that ""created"" human life on this planet. the basis for this exploration is cave drawings in multiple areas across the planet showing what appears to be the same life form being worshipped by the natives.

(potential spoiler alert) as is the case with worship, eventually i believe the people stopped believing, and our ""parents"" decided to leave. with the desire to come back. and teach us respect for our elders in a big way. it turns out the creatures from the original movie were a weapon of mass destruction (this is well known to those who know the backstory of the original ), and the creators (called engineers in the film) were coming to wipe us ingrates out. (i personally think) the engineers created us as either slaves, and we rebelled; or as cattle for gladiator type games. or maybe they were just psychotic. either way, i now have a new movie to hungrily wait to come out on dvd to fill my sci-fi adventure appetite.",1339113600,10,1890,4.622023809523809
4800134,5,B005LAIHY0,"This movie is absolutely meant as a starting-off place for a new branch of the Alien story. It isn't a reboot, but a different fork taken. I like the idea of what could be to come in a future sequel. Remember that though the first alien movie had many characters, subsequent movies focused predominantly on Ripley. This one will certainly focus on the two best developed characters from this one in future movies, with a chance to tie in with the Alien series at the end. I have to revisit the first Alien movie to see the tie-in to this point, but it definitely takes place before the first movie and at least in part explains the Alien characters.

Complaints about low character development may be justified to some extent, but there was so much crammed into the movie that it would have to be another hour long and not move the story along fast enough for most movie-goers to satisfy those who have issue with it. I think it would be great for those who are big Alien fans to get a directors cut similar to the Lord Of The Rings, but that's not going to matter a lot to the general movie going public.

I am not Christian, but did not feel the religious subplot was in any way detrimental to the film - it feels very personal to the central character and an interesting point.

Many reviewers seem to think that the Race before us was sending us very mixed messages. I believe future movies will reveal warring factions amongst them. Do we really think other races don't have devisions, no matter how advanced?

A lot of questions to debate until the next one and the potential for grand space opera to be played out boggles my mind. I was left thinking - gee, I can't wait for the next one!",1339113600,11,1695,4.388535031847134
4800135,5,B005LAIHY0,"I just got out of the theater from seeing Prometheus in 3D. I must say I have had very high expectations of this film since I first caught wind of it. The original Alien film is by far my favorite movie of all time, it's original and brilliantly directed. The perfect blend of sci-fi and horror is exactly the type of movies love.

The idea behind Prometheus is that Ridley Scott did not want to trespass on his original masterpiece from 1979, Alien. Prometheus is a prequel yes, however it is very original and is o so careful about not overstepping it's boundaries into the Alien film series. It is extremely well done and well written with solid acting and amazing special effects. Those who are not true fans or do not know Ridley will not understand why he was so careful with this film. Of his 30+ directed movies, this is only his third sci-fi film. The others being the original Alien 1979 and Blade Runner 1982 (also, he is currently working on a new Blade Runner project).

Prometheus does start off a little slow, simply to build the tension for the remainder of the film. The cast was perfectly chosen and each character has a strong, solid personality. The special effects are quite natural and realistic looking, they did an amazing job. The last 45 minutes of the movie are very intense and it is almost too wild for your mind to keep up with. The sets and models are huge and very detailed and each shot is naturally filmed which glues your eyes to the screen.

Those who are expecting a new film just like Alien may be disappointed due to the fact that this is an entirely new story built in as a early prequel to Alien. I also could see them making a sequel to Prometheus, which would be another prequel to Alien.

For true fans, Prometheus will not disappoint. It is new, fresh and is the untold story of one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Prometheus is less horror and more of a solid sci-fi film, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of scary moments and parts which will make you jump, but it seems like it had less of a focus on the horror aspect. This is one of those movies which is very deep on many levels and you must contemplate the movie after you watch it. There is a link to religion, mostly scientology, and basic human beliefs and interactions. It was very well done, well written and brilliantly filmed. I highly recommend this film and I honestly cannot wait to see it again. By far the best movie I have seen all year.",1339113600,9,2462,4.380743982494529
4800136,4,B005LAIHY0,"The prevailing critical opinion about the new movie Prometheus is that it looks great but is underwhelming in the story department, at least compared to the first two Alien movies.  in particular, many comment that there's no cathartic moment like the Ripley ""Get away from her!"" scene in Aliens.  I can see some truth in those observations, but there's still enough good stuff in Prometheus that I got a kick out of it.  First, the opening scene is fairly amazing, although I'll admit I still didn't quite understand it, even after watching the entire flick.  Then there's all the sci-fi/tech/CGI elements, which include but aren't limited to how great the ship looks landing on the alien planet, the nifty ""puppies"" (flying probes sent out to map the inside of the ancient Engineers' structure), and the automated surgical capsule.  Also, as a fan of the Alien film series (not counting the AvP movies, which are another thing), I appreciated all of the links to the other films, especially the android David and the giant control chair the Engineer sits in.  Whatever Ridley Scott says, Prometheus is certainly an Alien prequel -- the final scene leaves no doubt about that.  In fact, I'd rate it maybe 3rd or 4th best out of the five Alien films.  One negative aspect, though, was the poor or limited use of 3D.  I experimented with briefly removing my 3D glasses every so often for comparison, and usually I could see no difference between 2D and 3D.  So I felt like I wasted the extra bucks to see this in 3D rather 2D.  Sadly, this is a pretty common problem in today's 3D era.",1339113600,3,1584,4.682310469314079
4800137,4,B005LAIHY0,"First than all this is a good science fiction movie. It has the principal questions than any ""good"" scifi movie has to have: Where are we coming from? What are we? and Why? Packed with an excellent photography (CGI?) and a good action pace.
It's not a terror movie but there are some terror scenes. And of course It is not an Alien movie which is good because It's hard to imagine another plot with Aliens all over the place. Nevertheless there is a conection and some clarification to the first Alien which is thanked (or should it be).

It isn't perfect but is good enough as to make you want more!!

4800138,5,B005LAIHY0,"I am sure Prometheus is a kind of a movie, that will be recognized as a classic after many years. Like blade runner. Its a testament of Scott's ability to create great Sci-fi..I wouldnt say, its better than Alien (or worse) cause in my opinion, its a common flaw for most people to make the comparison! Granted ALIEN was more scary, but that is not the point..Prometheus is meant to be a key movie..It unlocks mysteries from the first motion picture, and creates others.. Deep Character development is also pointless, why mumbling and mumbling endlessly. ( I won't explain that cause i will reveal a major spoiler!! - you ll find it out your selves!!)

Technically is perfect. The details (inside the ship - on the planet etc) are jaw dropping. Performances are good. Music is block buster material, but the absence of Jerry Goldsmith is obvious. And that is my only problem.

4800140,4,B005LAIHY0,"Well even though it started nearly an hour behind schedule, I finally got to see Ridley Scott's long awaited ""Prometheus"" this evening. It has been debated whether or not this movie is a full-fledged ""Alien"" prequel. I can happily put those rumors to rest. ""Prometheus"" certainly takes place prior to ""Alien"" and it establishes tie-ins to the franchise at regular intervals; but this is not another ""Alien"" movie. I know that this sounds a little confusing, and it is; but once you see the film for yourself, you'll understand exactly what I mean. I'm not trying to say that ""Prometheus"" is formulaic, it may set up the events of the ""Alien"" franchise; but it is its own beast all together.

Helmed by Ridley Scott, who also directed 1979's ""Alien"". Ridley returns to the genre of Science Fiction after nearly a thirty year hiatus. Despite the gap, Ridley Scott certainly feels right at home in this field of story telling. Anyone who's ever seen a Ridley Scott film knows that he's always been a stickler for detail. The best part about Sci-fi is that he gets to make up all the details himself now. Honestly, does anybody know why Ridley wasn't asked to direct any of the other ""Alien"" films? I'm pretty sure he could have saved it a lot sooner. ""Prometheus"" boasts phenomenal visual effects and gruesome Alien mayhem; but never once did I feel as though I was watching something fictional. Everything on screen looks and feels as though it would really work and in doing so captivated me as an audience member.
Starring a AAA cast: Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, and one of my personal favorites Michael Fassbender all do exceptional work here. I won't go into too much detail about their respective characters, because I don't want to spoil anything. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) is part of team of explorers. They discover clues scattered across the globe pointing to the origins of mankind's presence on Earth. These findings lead the team on a journey across the stars to the darkest corners of the universe. Aboard their spaceship ""Prometheus"", they touch down on a foreign planet with hopes to make contact with alien life forms. Well make contact they do, and they must fight a thrilling and at times, terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.

""Prometheus"" may not answer all the big questions that its starts out trying to accomplish; but it does provide us with a satisfying story and compelling characters. It may not be everything we were hoping for, but I would label this as well done cinema. In the end, ""Prometheus"" may be construed as being a victim of over hype, but I believe that it delivers on most of its promises. It will be enjoyed by fans of the ""Alien"" franchise and hopefully regarded as the new standard for any more films in that franchise to come.",1339113600,7,2813,4.738775510204082
4800141,3,B005LAIHY0,"Prometheus is not only Ridley Scott's long awaited return to sci-fi but, also to the same universe that his breakout classic Alien took place in. Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurances of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous ""Company"" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliche' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliche' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, althought the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggrevating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the begining of Alien, which it eventually will.

4800142,5,B005LAIHY0,"UPDATE: Minor spoilers: After reading most if not all the reviews here...I was second guessing my first reviewing impressions. So I had to see it again. This time I wanted to see it in 3d. First the parts that were in 3d were really amazing but unfortunately those were pretty rare. This time I went in fully armed with almost every complaint in my head. I must say I actually enjoyed it more. I knew what answers too look for and most if not all were there. albeit most were really hard to find and masked by visuals and Rapices half naked body:) Answers like why is everyone taking off their helmet....well the Dr. said that the air was really clean even cleaner than their air. There were only 12 med pods made. Getting your hands on 2 impossible. Everything that David did was orders from Weyland but basicly he's searching for an identity within those confines. When asked he says he wishes his father dead so he could be free. The idiot that played with the snake and his buddy died as a result...well there is always one in the group and if you don't know who that is your probably it. lol If watch the movie and think something is impossible or bad science then your really not thinking this is a Sci-fi movie. 99% of space traveling movies are bad Science to our known Physics. Light speed travel is impossible. So think beyond our boundries....anyway I'm giving this movie another half star. The visuals are awesome. the creature creation is vivid and the best I've seen to date. The acting is top notch. It's not perfect so only 4 1/2 stars. Some things could be improved and a few more of the major questions answered but I'm sure they will come in the sequel to this prequel......For my first review read below....

So I read some of the reviews yesterday before I went to the midnight premier, So I have to say did any of those reviews see the movie I saw or are they just being to critical of things that just don't matter!?!?

Warning there will probably be spoilers probably extreme spoilers!

  First off yes there are 17 crew members but only about 4-5 that were really utilized in the movie...do you really need to have a meet and greet with all 17 crew members to make a good movie. Absolutely not! Reviewers saying the main characters are underdeveloped but do you really need to know that the captain of the ship failed his captains test 3 times...No....the movie gives you everything you need to know...captain is the captain, the mission supervisor is in charge, The android follows programming....sorry I don't need to be led by the hand and told what everyones part has to be...I can figure it out!

  Yes there are holes in the story line but I actually like it this way. I actually have a brain and can fill in the holes with my own imagination. Such as the opening scene of the ""engineers"" on a primordial planet takes the black goo and vaporizes into the water supply. It was never said that this was Earth(or the time frame of the event)but that is what the movie hints at. Matching human and engineer DNA. Also my imagination tells me that monkeys or primative man drinks the water supply and transforms into the humans today but with this being said the black goo on the earth sequence is not the same as the militarized version later in the movie...that goo does some weird stuff!! The main story line seems to be straight forward...Find the creators and have a sit down chat.

A look at some characters:

  Charlize Theron: Vickers: Mission supervisor...Hard charging straight forward. Some say she is evil but she is only doing what needs to be done to save the Prometheus from infestation. I think this was a good roll for her. Later you find out she's the daughter of Peter Weyland and this is good info even though she dies later. It explains why she has the billion dollar luxury suite (equiped with 700 inch semi-circular view screen and state of the art automatic surgery pod) and everyone else has crew quarters. later we find out what happens when they don't follow her protocal.
  Michael Fassbender: David: Android...As in all Weyland androids he's Weyland's evil hinchman and will do whatever it takes to succeed to Weyland's programming. This is a OCD wannabe human android...from picking up lint on a otherwise spotless ship to bleaching his roots...growing synthic hair or just wants to be human that bad??? GREAT JOB Fassbender! Reviewers will say he is fast to crack all the engineers door codes but nobody said the the doors were 128 bit encripted...maybe the letters on the door just say press here to open. He learns to fly the ship by watching the halogram...remember androids never forget! I think this was the best roll of the movie...
  Noomi Rapace: Shaw: archaeologist...Very good job she plays the part well...just to clear up something...she doesn't perform her own surgury to remove the baby alien...she gets in the automated pod...does it look painful oh yea! she is not the hero that Ripley is...she just trys to servive mostly!
  Logan Marshall-Green: Holloway/shaws husband: archaeologist...Reviews will lead you to believe that he is a scumbag alcoholic that mistreats Shaw. The facts are he never mistreats her. He drinks once because he thought his mission was a failure. He makes love to Shaw before he knew that he was infected...then he finds out something is going on(worms in the eye) he doesn't tell anyone but really who would? And finally he sacrifices himself so that the others could board the prometheus....sound like a loser to you? yea me either!
  Idris Elba: Captain: Don't really need a big roll but he's the kind of Captain that will go down with the ship....and he does!

  Now the meeting of the Engineers....As stated during the movie...Prometheus was directed to a military bio-engineering base which was realize later in the movie. So the Engineers are hostile! This is the only part I don't understand...Why would they leave 35k year old directions to a military base? Maybe the directions wheren't meant for us??? Maybe the disintegrating engineer was a rouge and wanted humans to evolve...who knows but anyway the first contact with the engineers are hostile did you really expect anything different??? Really? What do you think would happen if you bumped into a Predator...doesn't matter what the odds are against him...he's not going to shake your hand and invite you to a cup of tea!

  People are taking off their helmets on the first instance of breathable air this is because humans are inherently stupid to be the first person to breath alien air but as soon as the action starts you'll notice they aren't so ready to pull off their helmets. All the dead engineers are wearing there helmets but also they were running from some kind of infestation. Couple of reviews where wondering about this but really please watch the movie! Not only are helmets protection but also are better computer interfaces! Have you not seen Ironman? As for the design of the engineers helmets WHO CARES!!!

  Religion is so subtle in this movie...not sure why people are making such a big deal about it....Shaw's cross was mentioned twice and towards the end she says she still believes in God...again a non-issue!

  At the end of the movie Shaw decideds to take the engineers space craft to their home world....Well let see what would you do...return it to earth and because you almost gave birth to an alien be disected by the people in charge never to return to space...would you take the ship for a joyride around the galaxy or take it to the engineers home would to try and find out the answers you've looked for your whole life....myself I'm going for a joyride...definitely Earth is out of the question!!!

  Ok so no matter what people are going to compare this movie to Alien...saying that this movie left more questions than answers....Well didn't Alien leave you with a 33 year question. At least now we know what that spacecraft was. It even touchs on the question where Alien came from...The very last creation of the engineers looks surprising like...you guessed it an Alien. This is not the first movie in the series nor will it be the last...I'm pretty sure some gaps will be filled in at a later date. Alien vs Predator vs Engineer and now we are out there too so vs Humans anyone???",1339113600,23,8284,4.689655172413793
4800273,5,B005LAIHY0,"The 3d was excellent in IMAX 3D.  Throughout the movie, the 3d was phenomenal.  It wasn't like watching a 3D flick where you have double images at times, it was perfect throughout.  Sometimes I forgot I was actually watching a 3d film, but subconsciously knew I was, it was that good.

As for the movie, it answered a great deal about the ""Pilot"" or ""Space Jockey"" species that we saw in the first film, maybe not everything.  Not all the questions that the Prometheus movie asked were explained in this film, but that's because Scott intends on doing a sequel, if Fox will fund it.  So in my opinion, what I went there for, I was extremely pleased.  Plus now it's like the franchise has been revitalized, just like the J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot a couple years back. If anyone has done the research on this film like I have, there was much discussion about making this film, then another shortly after.  As an Alien fanatic, I would much rather have many questions unanswered and have a sequel, than have just one movie.  4 new hours of the Alien universe, vs 2 hours? I'll take 4 any day of the week.

My only complaint about the movie would be the score.  If they would have make the score more like the original Alien, it would have seemed darker and more thrilling.  I'm no where near docking a point off my rating though just for some music, I much enjoyed everything else about the film and will be seeing it as much as I can while it's in theater.

I'm not going in to the plot, because that would spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  But if you want to know more about the Space Jockey's, go see this film.  This film is also action packed.  There's very little character building, about 10 minutes in, the visuals are flying at you non-stop for the rest of the film.  Awesome!!!",1339113600,13,1794,4.371601208459214
4800274,2,B005LAIHY0,"This is probably the greatest disappointment of the year, if not the decade. Building up hype is a risky game. When you fall; you fall from a really high place. Ridley Scott, the legendary director; the man who gave us the Alien in the first place has done just that. He failed miserably.
I do not want to ruin anybody's experience so there are no spoilers here. I just want to share why I am so unhappy with it.
Prometheus tries to be too many things and fails at everything it tries to do.
Visually it is truly stunning and beautiful. But that's all. Even Avatar had a better and more coherent story. At least it had some characters that were not one-dimensional.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to isolate Prometheus from the Alien series and treat it as a stand-alone movie as some are advising us to do. (not that it would save it from being a mediocre film at best). There are too many references to the Alien franchise from the beginning till the end (oh, the horrible horrible end). Prometheus is meant to be a prequel whatever people may say.
First of all, with its glorious target of tying everything together, this movie should have been much longer. Diffeent stories and ideas fly from every direction and are simply left there lying untouched as they crash and burn. Mr. Scott, who had shown great mastery in the Alien by not giving too much information and keeping the details to the minimum necessity level has done the opposite here. And this is one of the basic reasons the film fails. There are too many things happening and you don't have the time to absorb them. You never feel immersed. You never feel you are there with the crew. You are not scared. You don't even care when they die.
One could have left the movie theater feeling a bit satisfied if at least a few things had made sense. But that, unfortunately, does not happen either.
There are movies, where I leave my brain outside so that my intelligence is not insulted. But then, Prometheus claims not to be this kind of a movie. It asks the grandest of questions: Where do we come from? Why? So, is it an intelligent movie? No.
Alien was almost philosophical. It was slow. It had this sinister atmosphere which started with the opening scene and the haunting music. And it ended with the same note. There is no suspense, no claustrophobia in Prometheus. No atmosphere at all.
With Aliens, we had more action than brains. And we chose not to see the plot holes because the action was so good. I still think Aliens is the best action movie ever. Prometheus doesn't even come close to Aliens.
So, where does this leave us? If another director had tackled these questions without trying to tie all the loose ends with one single knot to one of the greatest movies of all time, I could have said: Good effort but mediocre result.
When Ridley Scott kills off such a good idea and almost ruins Alien for me; then I say this is unacceptable.
Extended review 11/06/2012:
Please be warned, there be SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS.
Having gone through reading more of the positive reviews (and being rather disturbed by the one who called anyone with a negative review as retarded) I thought may be I should share my problems with the movie more openly. If there is anyone who can make some explanation about the below problems I would be most indebted.
1. Why would an intelligent humanoid extraterrestrial decide to destroy himself to create life on Earth? Is there no better way? And the Earth looks quite developed at that time. Are all Earthlings their children or is it only us?
2. Why would there be a map on Earth for a military base that was meant to destroy Earth? If it was not meant for us why did so many civilizations know about it?
3. When you go exploring a planet that may hold the key to one of the greatest questions ever asked do you only take a ragtag band of few scientists?
4. How does a geologist who has ""dogs"" that can map an entire structure, get lost in the same structure?
5. How does an android know the language of an advanced civilization without prior contact with that civilization?
6. Why would there be a 3D recording of what happened to the ""soldiers"" 2000 years ago? How did David know which sequence would start the recording?
7. Having seen there is (or was)  something deadly in the structure that killed members of  a more advanced civilization - how can scientists be so ignorant to open doors or touch anything in that structure before thoroughly testing everything?
8. Following the same line of thought, how could a biologist be stupid enough to try touching a new life form that has suddenly appeared out of the blue?
9. How can a ship's captain be so uncaring about his crew when they are stuck inside an unkown structure with a potential reading from an undetermined lifeform?
10. Why would a very advanced race create deadly creatures that need other creatures' wombs to reproduce, as weapons of mass destruction? Wouldn't a specific virus be a better solution? Who would be cleaning up those pests after the attack? Obviously even the Engineers have a problem with controlling these ""weapons"". And yet they keep thousands of cylinders ready to be deployed on their ships.
11. We know the xenomorph has an accelerated growth rate and we know it grew to a considerable size quickly in Alien (I always assumed it ate a lot of rats). However, the one that Shaw got out of her body had no food available to it. Yet it was enormous within a few hours. How?
12. For me one of the worst scenes was the ending where we see a proto-xenomorph being born. There we see a reference to the horrible AVP: Requiem. It would appear that the xenomorph evolves by taking genes from its host and by creating something else. If so, why didn't we observe the same behavior with human hosts? The proto-xenomorph is born from the body of the Engineer, having obviously evolved further from the white octpussy thingy that grew in Shaw's womb. Yet in all Alien movies humans have been used as hosts but we see no such result (except on Alien 4 where Ripley herself is a genetic mashup of human and xenomorph).

I may have made wrong observations or may have reached wrong conclusions. After all, I watched Prometheus only once. I have watched Alien and Aliens may be 20 times each. But these points bugged me and caused me to dislike this movie (and I did want to love it). Am I the only one?",1339113600,11,6390,4.530735930735931
4800275,1,B005LAIHY0,"More is definitely less.

""Did you ever see the movie 2010?"" Stanley Kubrick once asked a resident screenwriter.  ""They ruined it. They explained everything.""  There's an old maxim in creative writing.  Never TELL your audience - SHOW them.  That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too.  Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant.  On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares.  Ridley is much better than this.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.  If you don't want to read the rest of the review, I'll cut to the chase right here.  You ever see the recent prequel of The Thing?  It was good, not great, but good.  Well Prometheus is pretty much the exact same movie, but much much stupider and no where near as absorbing.

Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Despite how hard the movie  tells the audience what we are watching is an Alien ""prequel,"" (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive in execution to connect Pormetheus Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3.  Those films were at best, riveting.  At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring.  I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.  Aliens vs Predator may even have a better script..

I know right?

Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce.  From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves in the unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films.  One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets.  Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in.  Then there's the other half.  A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags.  Oh but there are mysteries.  Why do they keep taking the helmets off?  Why bother having them at all?  Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty ""leftover?""  That's just the short end of it.  How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans?  Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST.  He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too?  Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had.  That last ""reveal""  was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.

But it's not all bad.  Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her.  Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end.  Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money.  I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.

Where did humans come from?  I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving.  It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from.  She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked.  Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask.  Now we know Ripley, now we know.",1339113600,34,4314,4.5837696335078535
4800276,1,B005LAIHY0,"If you liked Alien/Aliens and must see it, wait for the rental first, then decide if you should buy the DVD. If you like everything having to do with the Alien franchise such as AvP, then you are probably safe in getting the DVD.

This movie was marketed so well with an excellent trailer, complete with the 'aahhhh' siren sounds from the original 1979 Alien trailer, which leads prospective viewers to believe it will be a horror type prequel to Alien. I would have been more satisfied had I paid to watch the trailer looped for two hours, because it had the right background music, the right dialogue, and the right scenes. The rest of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. ""Cut it off! Cut it off!""

It's a B rated sci-fi TV show at best with interesting concepts poorly executed.

Some people may consider the next comments SPOILERS:

It's not a horror movie, but it does have all the aspects from the Alien franchise in it such as how the alien attacks and reproduces with scenes that are supposed to be gross/gory but fall flat. The background music was similar to that of Apollo 13 when Tom Hanks was excited to be going to the moon. The alien type creatures looked like they came from the movie Sphere or an aquarium. I found myself laughing half the time, especially when ""the claw"" from Toy Story appeared.

I actually liked the concept of the evolution of the ""alien"" to show something different and of it being more of a space exploration movie. I liked the concept of maybe 3 prequel sequels. I also like the concept of what I believe the twist is going to be in the sequel to this movie, which would explain the Space Jockeys' motives. Unfortunately, it just was not executed well at all.

Other reviewers, who downgraded the movie, were correct. It lacked character development. Do I need to read their resumes? No, but some more interaction among the crew would've helped like they did with Aliens or Blade Runner for that matter. Then there's the illogical things the characters do. For example, in one scene that is in the trailer involving Shaw dropping to her knees, logical dialogue would have been ""What happened? Are you okay?"", instead it's more like ""Hello. Nice of you to stop by.""

SPOILER****SPOILER*****SPOILER - Just as an added side note for people who watched it, but thought it didn't correspond to Alien correctly. Prometheus is not a direct prequel. The Space Jockey and his ship are NOT the same Space Jockey and ship that the Nostromo found. Prometheus was on LV-223 with pyramid structures that are supposed to tie in with Earth's pyramids. The Nostromo went to LV-426 and found a ship that had crashed on its own accord. Remember from Aliens, Ripley said, ""..It was not from there. It was a derelict spacecraft...."" The LV-223 Space Jockeys had begun terra forming the place and were using it as a storage facility. Maybe the sequel explains how a different ship ended up on LV-426 with eggs instead of vases. Perhaps it's the ship Dr. Shaw was flying at the end of Prometheus. END SPOILER*** END SPOILER *****END SPOILER

My advice: Watch the TV viral videos and the trailers and then watch Alien again instead.",1339113600,32,3172,4.651785714285714
4800277,3,B005LAIHY0,"My official rating for this movie is a 3 stars out of 5. My review is full of spoilers so don't read if you haven't seen it. Prometheus is one of those movies that is hyped beyond expectation, literally. The hype for this movie was too high, and unfortunately left many disappointed. I didn't have any real expectation or idea of what the movie was going to be like, but I was pleasantly surprised of how good this movie is. The acting is superb from all actors. The main character, Shaw, really gave this movie that needed thrill and horror factor. Shaw goes through absolutely hell before she gets off that damn planet. She survived an attack against a 8ft tall humanoid, and had to surgically remove an alien feeding off of her womb while conscious. While she tries to survive with a stapled stomach. Noomi really gave us that amazing acting to give us anxiety and make us cringe of the horrors she was going through. All characters had their own personality. Charlize was pure evil, but her evil is more of a survival instinct. The ""space jockey"" is really creepy and demonic looking, which makes ""him"" look really intimidating and scary, which is the point. The visuals are amazing and huge in scale. I paid attention to certain details of the characters. For example, Shaw was a believer in God, and it was very interesting how battling against an alien made her faith in God even stronger. I am excited of how the home world of the ""space jockey""/aliens will look like, and what the next explorers or Shaw will discover. My favorite elements of the movie are the small things in the characters, like Shaw's faith, and how the captain of prometheus was really dedicated to not transport death to earth, and how charlize's character is somewhat mean and cold because her father treated her that same way. Very good movie, and may not be for everyone. A solid 3 stars.",1338940800,10,1872,4.607784431137724
4800278,3,B005LAIHY0,"If you aim high - very high - you best be ready to meet expectations. The expectations for making a movie such as Prometheus are that you don't scrimp on any of the main ingredients - special effects, art direction, cinematography, music, characterisation, and plot. Ridley Scott's prequel to the Alien saga gets it right on the first three but falls short (sometimes far too much) on the latter three.

  Scott's return to the Alien story (a 33-year distance in release dates of his two efforts) reveals how much the director has changed his craft. His eye for detail and precision in capturing science fiction worlds has evolved finely. But his meticulousness has not carried over into demanding the best in stories and its characters. Instead of making a concerted effort to make sense of characters (flesh them out, merit their inclusion in the story), and to plug holes in a film's story by rooting out problem areas/weaknesses, Scott has frustratingly let these things slide with the result of making Prometheus, arguably one of the most eagerly awaited films of all time, a needlessly flawed film.

  The film's plot has a much loftier endeavour that Alien;that in itself is not a problem, but it may open up more pitfalls. It is basically concerned with the origins of mankind, so it can't really get much bigger. And why the pitfalls of Prometheus are frustrating is because they could have been pretty easily avoided. Whether it is because Scott is not too pushed about ensuring characterisation and plot are as best as can be achieved or whether he tried and just didn't get it right is one question, but one certainty is that the problems with the film are identifiable as being his responsibility (with slight exception of the sometimes ill-fitting score).

  This review will not run through the plot of Prometheus or offer a summary; it will merely identify some areas.

  The foreign world where the Prometheus story unfolds looks wonderful; it has that giant scope that one may want from a big budget sci-fi attempt (it looks better than worlds depicted in Avatar). The CGI and other effects are spot on. It has a lush, crisp image. One can well believe it is real. They simply look good and do the business.

  But there are too many characters in the movie; the time is too short to give them enough room to merit their inclusion and at least five or six are there just to be expendable in one scene. The secondary characters are weak; either formulaic or simply boring. The geologist is supposed to a bit whacky; he looks the part, but his dialogue is so trite and his strained relationship with the biologist doesn't work. Kate Dickie who plays the Ford character is quite a decent actress (those who've seen Red Road or the first season of Game of Thrones will agree) but she is a total misfire in this movie - again poor dialogue, which appears to delivered on an overdubbed track by the actress and sounds amateurish.

One might be tempted to think Logan Marshall-Green is not up to the task; he doesn't seem to be a serious actor, but maybe his lines and script don't do him any favours (or maybe they should have hired his doppelganger Thomas Hardy to the job instead). Noomi Rapace is a fine actress. The more you see of her the more she grows on you. She has some intense scenes and she handles them well. Her character has some silly flaws - how a talented scientist like herself still clings to a basic and juvenile Christian belief in the wake of everything she knows - but that doesn't stick out too sorely, mainly because Rapace is that good.

Charlize Theron is also talented but is a bit restricted in her role. If her character had better lines and one or two more scenes where we see more of who and why she is what she is it would have worked better. And why can't she run in any direction but straight on in one particular scene at the end is just silly, but that is Scott's fault not Theron's. Idris Elba does a grand job at a standard character; he throws in a few subtleties that you would not get with others. Guy Pearce looks ridiculous to be honest; they still haven't mastered the art of having an actor thoroughly act old when they appear (in this case ridiculously so) old.

Michael Fassbender is undoubtedly the star of the film; he's perfect as the disciplined and fascinated android. He throws in some nice touches here and there and he seems to be the only character the film has got just right. But a strange point of his android character, David, is that he seems to be the only one who has a patent wonder at what he sees. The others seem to just throw out ""oh we're in the presence of our creators"" attitude as if it's a standard days work.

The film may be confused in its atmosphere. For example the scene where Rapace performs a procedure on herself is excellent and terrifying, worthy of any scene in Alien or landmark comparator. But that sense of terror is never really captured again, this is a real shame. In one scene where they first discover the ""vases"" and things start to change with nefarious undertones, Rapace has to convey this while the score repeats the main title score which is far too light (almost uplifting) for that scene. That is simply a stupid mistake to make. It is repeated at the end when Rapace delivers her `last survivor' message, she's sending out a warning while the music plays light notes.

The ""Engineers"" look good (they look like giant bald Trent Reznors) and in one scene we hear what they sound like, which was suitably unnerving. But on the topic of the Engineers probably the most intriguing question of the movie is why they turned on humans? Did they regret making the human species directly, or did they create other life that evolved into humans but not according to their plan? What was it about humans that they had a problem with? And at what stage of human development did they plan to destroy mankind? These fascinating aspects (which again only Rapace seems to put forward) are not delved into. Is it likely they ever will be? Will there be a sequel to Prometheus? There could be, and it wouldn't be such a bad thing as it is fascinating territory. But if there is to be a sequel I hope Scott doesn't make it. I suspect someone like Christopher Nolan (or, impossibly, Stanley Kubrick) would handle it better.

Finding faults aside, Prometheus is still worth the buck for reasons for aforementioned (namely its look, effects, select performances, and the odd interesting sequence) and it will still make its stamp on science fiction film. Just a shame it didn't have a stricter, more perfectionist ethos behind it.

4800279,1,B005LAIHY0,"Wow this movie was bad.

I watched this movie last night. This movie left me with more questions than answers.  This movie rivals Red Tails in terms of poor character development, bad plot and awesome effects.

I'm going to breakdown the movie here so if you don't want to read any of it, you better leave now.

Lets start off with the beginning shall we?

The opening scene with the guy killing himself, its an interesting scene, well constructed but lacks any meaning. There is no information about why he is doing it or what he hopes to achieve. Without more information, instead of being given information, we have to decide for ourselves what is really going on here. I don't really have a problem with that if you are given enough information to at least have a general sense of what it is that they are doing. The problem is that there is no information given, just a guy that could be having anything being done.
I've heard theories of ritualistic sacrifice that went wrong or right depending on the view point to seeding a planet with life. Truth be told, we don't even know what that is, in the end of the entire scene all we see is some DNA in the water that seems to be survive. However, if all that was meant to happen, why was the DNA being destroyed so utterly and completely by the thing he drank? Would you seed life on a planet by trying to destroy the very thing your trying to do? Seems totally and utterly illogical to me. I mean even if you intended to die in the process of giving life to a planet, wouldn't you do it in such a way that you don't destroy the very DNA your trying to spread? Not to mention, he uses something that looks very much like the stuff that was oozing from the containers found later in the movie. So why was he using that? Also the alien ship in the background looks nothing like the alien ships used by the engineers throughout the rest of the movie. Does this mean that its just another model or perhaps another alien race? Is this some kind of shout out saying that the Engineers were defeated and this was a ritualistic way of ending his life like samurai used to do. I mean for all we know he was drinking their version of coffee and was about to go for a morning swim when he got poisoned, there just isn't enough information to make a proper logical deduction about the scene. Really, this calls out for explanation or the scene has little to no meaning in it. If it was left out of the movie entirely, I don't think anybody would have missed it. It doesn't contribute anything at all in the end except confusion.

Well, lets fast forward a little bit then shall we, to lets say the ship. You have the robot walking around looking at peoples dreams while they are in their tubes, that is fine and all, I don't see people staying awake for 2 years like that so it makes sense. Then he walks around watching movies and playing basketball. I admit it gives him a very human appearance but to what end? Throughout the entire movie this robot seems to be a enigma. Does he have feelings or just a rudimentary understanding of human interaction? 1 line from Weyland himself could have ended this puzzle but instead they leave it once again up to us to puzzle it out. His actions and his words just seem to be very very odd. I would consider him a great deal like the android from Alien 1. Totally and utterly devoid of emotion and empathy with a job to do and to hell with everything else. However he seems to be sentient so perhaps just a psychopath? That is just what you get when you create something without a soul? Is that some underlying theme? Regardless, I'm just going to ignore him for the rest of the movie, he seems to be like superman, knows everything and does everything and everybody trusts him entirely. I guess Asimov's 3 rules of robots were never applied to him, or any other robot in this universe and nobody has any problem with that. Well, lets continue to say he is emulating humans quiet nicely, which means he is self aware, sentient and considering he has reactions to things around him, either pretending to have emotions or actually having emotions. He has just some insanely crazy lines in the movie. ""Don't we all wish our parents were dead"" is a good example of that. If somebody said that to you, wouldn't you get a bit worried. Especially if its a robot that may well consider humanity its parent and you have a crew of 17 that you have to rely on. Its just freakish that nobody seems to care.

Well, now that we are done with the robot, lets continue on with lets say the rest of the crew shall we. Amazing spoiler here, Weyland is on that ship. His Daughter is on that ship, the robot, David which he considers his son is on that ship. That has to be the three most powerful people in the Weyland company on 1 ship that cost as they put it Trillions of Dollars in to making, so why don't we just get some randomly picked misfits together for the rest of the crew. I can understand the 2 scientists that were brought along as true believers, that is fine and all. Then a biologist who is a blank slate really, no real connection or anything to anybody but I'll get back to him later on when I dismember that tunnel scene preceding his death. The geologist, well, lets link him with Mr. Biologist cause face it, their only real interactions were with each other and they were so totally pointless that its unbelievable. Then we have a hand full of doctors for Weyland and a rather 2 dimensional Daughter of Weyland on the ship. The cabin crew were just strange and well, why wouldn't they be, its like they took the worst possible crew to go on an expedition like this. We all know that Weyland is a total moron but then again, I've got an entire section on him coming as well. Well, needless to say, I'll just end this crew analysis with this - Why would you spend Trillions of dollars, a vast fortune on all of this and then crew it by misfits? Easy, you wouldn't but it makes for some interesting television of done right. . .it wasn't done right.

Lets continue on, its Christmas, hooray, lets go out with just a few hours of sunlight and a massive storm that a science vessel has no way of seeing until its only minutes away. . .interesting that they are even calling them scientists. I can understand some zealotry but when you land on a dead world after coming through a very interesting descent, what you want to do is rush out as soon as you land to enter some rocks. Its interesting how they explore those rocks, I'm sure glad that they didn't have more than 4 of those things to go explore with, I mean you might expect them to deploy a few from the main ship to analyse the ground area around them, search for nearby areas worth exploring or perhaps deploy them from space to I don't know, look for tell-tale signs of life down there. Nope, lets just fly down and just use the good old fashioned fly around till we see something we like, I'm glad that they found it so fast, I mean wouldn't the movie have been boring if they had spend 3 weeks flying around looking around for mounds to be piled in rows, cause we all know that can't be natural. Regardless, it would have just been strange if they had dropped something down and scanned the entire planet like that because then you would expect all survey vessels to do the same in the future in which case Aliens 1 might be explained away cause they are a freight hauler but Aliens 2 would be rather strange. So lets just pretend I'm the only one that is smart enough to see that the application of technology seems to be well. . .rather stupid here. Anyways, lets continue on cause there is so much to say and I bet by now nobody is reading this anymore. Congratulations to those of you that still are managing to keep going at this point since I'm still only just starting. Back to the point of this paragraph is really this - Are they charging out and doing stuff that no scientist would do and are they misusing technology they took along with them, why yes, yes they are. Why are they doing that? My guess is because they have a crew of misfits that shouldn't be there.

Fast forwarding again, they travel out with their lovely vehicles, very nice all terrain vehicles at that, as long as everything is flat, not rocky and you know, built like a highway. I mean its obvious that those are the conditions they were expecting to find. Lets forget about that for now - like we may all wish to forget about this movie later. Off they travel to the first mound, instantly find an entrance that thankfully David can read, decipher and open within moments. We all know that if your in a scientific research center or military base or whatever it is since it wasn't actually explained in the movie, you wouldn't expect any safety issues. I mean they are only handling the most dangerous things that may come to mind in this universe, why wouldn't you at least put a padlock on the door. Nope, just a standard opening of everything. Well, they enter and why not have air here, I mean we all hate those big bulky things they are wearing to keep the atmosphere out. So lets take them off cause we all know, unknown atmospheres are harmless. I mean its not like scientists would have any idea about diseases from one place having incredibly harmful effects on others. I mean when the Spanish traveled to South America they found out that the diseases they were immune to were harmless to all those millions and millions of people they wiped out there by you know, sneezing on them. So that goes to show, another scientific mundane useless thing done, you would expect with only 17 people that you wouldn't want half your crew down with the alien version of the plague on day 1. Regardless, a bit later David spots a computer console up on a wall and guess what, he manages to climb up some rocks on a wall that doesn't appear to have had a cave in, meaning it was built that way. . .strange. . .to activate something on the wall to show a holographic representation of people running scared somewhere. Now call me crazy but other than looking interesting and cool, what kind of thing is that good for? I am hard pressed to think of any good reason that it was there, easily accessible and how it all fits together. They follow it to find a dead Engineer and then the Geologist and Biologist freak out and leave. . .cause we all know a biologists dream wouldn't have anything to do with finding an alien life form that he could analyse or whatever. I mean its very interesting to find a person so scared of a dead alien who then runs off with a geologist and gets lost. . .I mean wow.

Anyways, here it breaks off in to 2 parts of stupidity. Firstly that the geologist and biologist get lost when you can easily see where they are from the ship and you can tell that they basically went down 1 tunnel, so your talking about them getting lost between going right or left. Regardless about them, I'll get back to them again in a minute, lets continue on the lines of utter stupidity, David manages to open the door and what do we have there, a head that has no meaning, I didn't even see the arms cradling the room. Its a storage room, where did the 2 Engineers that made it in there run off to? Why did they run off in to there? What were they running from? What was so scary that they were willing to decapitate one of their friends to close the door? If they were running away from something that had them that scared, why wasn't it captured on the holographic projections? Assuming they survived (since their bodies were not inside) why didn't they clean up the mess? Never explained, I guess since they are in the room now, no further explanation is required. These vats then all over the ground begin to ooze after the humans enter, seems a great deal like the Face-Hugger eggs to me in a 'prehistoric form'. Rather cut and dry but it doesn't seem to alarm anybody that there are vats spewing out organic material all around them that seems to have been activated by their arrival. No cause for alarm I guess, it could be their version of mustard gas or its an alien Christmas celebration that just happen to be starting at the same time. . .you know if they believed in that. No cause for alarm there. Then at the back of the room we had something else, a rather interesting piece of architecture - an alien design in to a wall. Really? It looks exactly like an alien really, the design doesn't seem to have much detail so it leaves a great deal to the imagination but its easy to spot the tell tale features of an alien. Then the mural, I honestly didn't really get a good view of it at all. There were 6 of us, nobody say the hands or got any idea what the mural was about, let alone that it seems rather out of place doesn't it. Everything is barren rock, some of it carved and otherwise incredibly materialistic, yet we have murals in a storage room. . .Look a storm is coming, I'm glad this trillion dollar spaceship can detect a storm coming and give people a 15minute time frame to escape. . .

Well, as I said, that was a 2 part stupidity, so after the escape, I won't even go in to the 'event scene' there, I don't feel I really have to, obviously something to make the masses get worked up about something, I mean so far nothing other than stupidity has happened, none of the characters are more than 1 dimensional cutouts except the main cast which are of course, 2 dimensional - they have managed to prove themselves both stupid and extremely dedicated, mainly dedicated to their stupidity over anything else, but still, its something more than the rest of them. Well, back to the Biologist who turned his back on what was most likely going to be his crowning achievement on his life's work because door scary and of course the Geologist who really I don't even know why they took him. . .I mean he is a Geologist, what did they hope to use him for? This rock appears very old, I'm glad that we took him. The entire reason they took him was to release those things that flew around that they only use in the caves to repeat myself from earlier. Glad they couldn't train a monkey to do that, the monkey might have been more useful to an expedition like this. . .Sigh. . . Anyways, they get lost, they get told that there is a life form reading while they are standing around a bunch of dead Engineer bodies that guess what, Mr. Biologist isn't willing to even really look at. There are some obvious trauma's that are about the size of guess what, that thing they come across later on. . .now tell me, 2 people scared of a door wouldn't make a connection like that? Worm with the same size as the hole in all these dead creatures. . .must be harmless, a door scared us before, lets play with these things, if anything its moving around and everything like a cobra, we all know they aren't dangerous. . .Well, not to spoil a good death scene, I might as well continue cause it wasn't good, totally and utterly retarded.

Fast forward a bit further, nobody notices David stealing a vat, well, I would guess that isn't really a shock, David seems to be running up ahead, looking at things, clicking stuff, doing whatever he wants all the time and usually only after he has done it, something happens that brings it back to David, you might think people that are scared might pay a closer eye on somebody doing things that keeps freaking them out. Guess not. Anyway, now we are back on the ship, David spikes lead scientists drink who seems incredibly drunk, never really explained why he is so depressed, ooh, he didn't find the aliens alive, guess that the most monumental discovery in your life on a small remote part of a planet must mean that they have gone extinct, what can I say, its dedication to stupidity, its what his character is made of. Then of course the entire bridge is empty when the people are having their close encounter with an alien life form, cause with 17 people on the ship, nobody would be awake when your on an alien planet in case something happened. Especially considering you have 3 bridge crew that seem to only have to stay on the ship. . .Lets avoid that shall we. Lets also avoid the fact that the ship is a scientific ship that apparently doesn't hold logs of things like when a team member contacts in. I mean its not something you would want to keep records of. Regardless. That I think was about the point were my stupidity tank hit its full capacity. Its an amazing thing to suddenly realize that the movie is so bad you should stop trying to think of it in any other tone other than a cartoon from the 70s.

Well, lets just hit some of the big bases still since I'm tired of writing this and face it, I doubt anybody is going to read all of this.

Lets see, they go back for their dead crew, and guess what, they come back with only 1, guess the other one wasn't worth caring about till he shows up at the ships doorstep with hulk smash powers. Not to mention a giant metal truck, gasoline, guns, everything on him, he still survives ages, I mean since gravity is the same on this planet as Earth (as seen by how people move around), I don't care how much alien tissue you have flip-flopping through your system, you drive over him with a giant vehicle, shoot his brains out, torch him, any of them will get a kill.

Then again, we got the scene with the scientist dedicated to stupidity sacrificing himself, how noble of him. Why are there medical bays if you have no intention of using them? Why in a space craft where most medical emergencies most likely will involve something happening outside are there no direct entrances to medical facilities from outside?

Lets see, David finds a live Engineer. Good for him. Wakes him up, I'm glad that Weyland wants to live forever. I mean he really wants it so he comes unarmed, unprepared to defend himself against a possibly hostile alien, totally no precautions taken and wakes him up and asks for immortality. Don't worry though, no explanation given why the alien decided to go crazy and kill everybody.

Why did the Engineers want to wipe out all life on Earth? Seems like a great deal of trouble to wipe out all life on Earth by releasing a new life form that is capable of wiping Engineers out in the process. I mean wouldn't you create something that would be obedient? Ooh it got away from them, that will be the main argument about why it went the way it went. Well, I guess a species as materialistic wouldn't believe in safeguards. Also why would Weyland believe they could give him immortality. Wouldn't his hopes for that be dashed the moment he heard they used sleeper chambers themselves. They know how to make things immortal cause they put themselves to bed on long trips cause they don't want to age either, must mean they just don't do it to themselves for some reason.

Then the entire thing where the medical chamber was only meant for a male, why would you seriously seriously remove the medical information for a woman? Who owns it. . .the Daughter of Weyland. . .WHY WOULD SHE HAVE IT!!!!

The girl breaks out of the medical bay with alien baby in her belly, then does a cesarean section in graphic movie fasion. . .glad nobody decided to find out where she removed alien baby, since there is only 1 place on the ship to do it other than the room she was in. Nobody went to clean it up, an alien baby which turned in to huge octopus creature. STRANGE. Guess that must be why face huggers die right after they finish laying an egg or why they only come out of those eggs themselves right before doing it, cause otherwise they would somehow pull nutrition straight from a cosmic black hole that exists inside their tummies to grow to massive proportions and become what you see in that medical bay, a giant squid baby.

Now out of all the scientist, the pilot played by Idris, deduces the alien facility is a military installation (with poor security protocols-unless David is that damn good).  For which the aliens test Weapons of mass destruction and plan to take the black goo back to earth via their holographic version of google maps.

Also why did they have the alien pilot in that chair, looking exactly like the pilot from ""Alien""? Then he leaves the chair to lay the smack down on the Squids' mamma in the medical carrier only to get eaten by the alien squid baby.

The the all knowing David (I used have guys like this in my Calc classes), knows how to fly the alien life boat, but our heroine wants to go the alien pilot's home world to ask the all to important question:
WHY?

I hate to think that they are planning a sequel.

I love Sci-Fi, I'm not hard to entertain.  But a starmap>A pale 8 foot humanoid alien (who works-out alot), a random snake thing, a squid baby and David the android.  Damn, I mean you are Ridley Scott.

All I can say about this movie is that it must score a 1 or a 2 on a scale of 100. If it were any worse, it would be rated on a turkey scale, not a real scale. I rate my movies on a scale based on characters, character development, story lines, story line development and consistency.

Now I read somewhere that this movie was a prequel to the Aliens saga. If they had left out the Alien architecture on the wall in the room with the head, removed the alien birth at the end of the movie and the ships being identical to that found in Alien 1 and 2, you would be able to make some interesting connections but it wouldn't be considered anything related.

My recommendation in the end is, if you have half a brain or you analyse your movies while watching them or care much for things like acting, characters being more than 1dimensional and a story line that is horrible and instead you can still be taken aback by pretty lights, good graphics and are willing to forgive/forget the rest, go for it.

This movie really lacked plot, characters, story line and above all else, the one thing that should never be left out in a prequel, dedication to the original story line. It is a very hard thing to do, to end a movie at the same point another movie can begin from when that other movie has already been out for what? 33years? It really is tough. The bar is set so high that Olympic athletes could pole vault under it on the moon. Yet I'm glad to see that there are people out there still that can manage to limbo under it better than even the world record holders. They really attempted to dig a tunnel underneath the platform instead of go for gold. I guess an dishonorable mention in the toe tags of a franchise is better than nothing for them.",1338940800,32,22549,4.362943557989998

My fellow Amazon folks, stop right there.  Stop falling for hype.  Stop thinking Prometheus is related to the Alien franchise.  Stop expecting ANYTHING from this title.  That is the problem we seem to be having:  the hype and expectations.  We've all done it now and then.  You know, get drawn into trailers and think the film will be like that.  You think we would have learned by now, but we never do.  That simple little fact that trailers are rarely, if ever, are what the movie will play out.

Blink away trailers, cast/director interviews, and random rumor mills.  Walk into this film with open eyes.  Expect nothing and get your head in the mindset that this is a stand-alone Sci-Fi film, not connected to any other film.  Do that and you will enjoy it more.  Any attempts to connect it to Alien franchise or fall for the trailer hype and the film will be ruined.

Now, if you walk into this as a stand-alone film, it isn't that bad.  Yeah, some things don't make sense like why super intelligent being would act so simplistically or how a football sized critter grows to huge proportions without a food source.  But, it is a Sci-Fi film we are talking about.  We have to roll the dice and let some things slide.  No one watched Jaws and got hung up on how the shark got to the island, after all, right?

Is it an instant classic?  Nope.  Is it the worse thing ever captured on film?  Of course not.  It is a nice, middle of the road film that is a good way to kill just over 2 hours, with trailers.  Take it for what it is, not what the trailers claimed it would be.

Hope this post saves some folks a bit of heartache.  Enjoy.",1338768000,11,1659,4.333333333333333
4800281,2,B005LAIHY0,"Spoilers thar be, Maytees.

Is a man created by man still a creature of God or is it a monster? Do we have the right to create meta-human life? What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.

Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.

Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.

The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.

Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.

Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.

Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.

It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?

The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:

Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.

Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.

The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.",1338768000,20,5006,4.728211009174312
4800282,2,B005LAIHY0,"I don't generally write reviews unless something is incredibly good, or it's incredibly bad.  In this case, it's shockingly bad.  For years I have had a true admiration for Ridley Scott's work, but this is something he simply should not have signed as his.

In terms of plot, it's basically all over the place, goes from very good, to hmmmmfff ok, to seriously forgettable.  The initial setup is reasonably good, excepting the whitish alien drinking the black goo.  That whole scene does not make any sense at all, it's irrational, illogical and has no place in the movie, not even from an artistic point of view.  The same process could have been explained or hinted at in countless other more meaningful and rational ways.  From there on, until they hit the planet the movie is quite good and manages to set up a very promising number of possible situations and occurrences (but, none of the better possibilities are used or explored).  The mid part is completely disappointing as the movie does not manage to be coherent and come together, characters are poor to say the least, they don't develop at all(except when they die, they develop into pseudo zombies), and the character set is extremely chliche.  Seriously, no one with half a brain would choose such a crew to go on an interplanetary trip that is of such huge importance.  It simply makes no sense, characters are chosen for cheap effect, and not to help sustain or enhance the movie and underlying plot.

The iconic darkness and silence from Alien are gone, and they would have made the movie so much better. Also, the multicultural chaos from Blade Runner is not present here either.  This movie is very clinical, and way too predictable.  The rest of the movie simply unwinds itself into incongruous and irrational scenes mashed together to fill up the allotted time.  An example of some of the grossly irrational parts is : How on earth does a football sized (recently birthed) alien squid come to grow into a 30 ft kraken, incredibly, this happens while its's locked inside a sealed medical room.  It logically begs the questions:  what did they feed it, or what did it feed on ???  I can understand and enjoy sci-fi movies bending or even bypassing some of physics basic rules and laws, but this is simply ridiculous.  Most of the crew is just cannon fodder, the death of Weyland is horribly lacking in creativity, the space jockey never speaks or does anything that could be deemed understandable, too many key points are simply inferred by the characters apparently from empty space with no real explanation as to how they came to that conclusion.  The space jockey in general is OK, but most of what happens is so irrational and illogical the movie seems more like a very bad sci-fi channel movie, with a bigger budget, than anything else.

If I could I would send Mr. Scott a personal mail letting him know that this movie is simply unwatchable, not when he has Blade Runner and Alien to his credit.

For a director that has produced arguably two of the best, if not the best two, science movies to date, this feels like going to a Michelin Star Rated restaurant only to find a Big Mac inside the cloche.  This movie is a high budget poorly thought out film that manages to seal the coffin of the Alien, and Alien related franchise.  I feel cheated and I am honestly very hurt by what has happened here, I was led to see this movie enticed by bits and pieces of clever marketing hinting at something much bigger, better thought out and that promised to the the true heir to the Ridley Scott Sci-fi legacy.  But all this was just a marketing ploy, for my money.

I truthfully regret having seen this movie.  If you can, give it a miss, if you don't, you have been warned.",1338681600,17,3743,4.61631419939577
