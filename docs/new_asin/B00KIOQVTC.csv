8659287,5,B00KIOQVTC,"(Clown) was a movie I have been wanting to see since I heard about it! I'm a huge Eli Roth fan and he didn't disappoint with this .I found the story to be quite original and unique. The main character Kent played by (Andy Powers) finds an old clown suit ""that unbeknownst to him has
 an evil and terrifying history"" he puts it on for his son's birthday party to play (Dummo The Clown)  and it actually starts taking root on and in his body.

He finds out the suit is cursed and is turning him into a demon that eats children. The transformation effects are really good especially when he is completely transformed,he is terrifying and looks freaky and so cool. There's was a nice amount of gore but not as much as I expected, and it was all done extremely well. They don't shy away from showing children getting eaten or killed either.

The story got a little bogged down in a couple of places but that's such a small thing to complain about. There was a found Footage scene that was quite chilling as well.

The fact that they took the movie seriously said alot about the confidence they had in the story because it could have gone really wrong fast but it worked perfectly. All in all I think it's one of the best horror films I've seen in quite awhile.",1458432000,7,1255,4.323404255319149
8659288,4,B00KIOQVTC,This is the second best killer clown movie I've seen. It might be a low-budget film but it's worth the watch. The plot was good and the actors delivered well. The ending didn't disappoint as well.,1455753600,,196,4.472222222222222

8659290,5,B00KIOQVTC,"Clown lived up to all of my expectations. The thing I appreciate most about it is how straightforward it is. Many horror movies take too long to get to the scary stuff, and the characters and writing often aren't interesting enough to hold the movie on their own. In ""Clown"", instead of spending time developing the characters and setting up any subplots, Kent finds the haunted clown costume right off the bat. From then on, the focus of the story is on Kent's slow transformation into a demonic clown, and doesn't usually get distracted by focusing on other character drama. Another part of what makes Clown work is that it doesn't spend much time justifying its own premise. Although on paper, the plot of someone turning into an evil clown by putting on a magic costume sounds pretty silly, the film is so ernest that you don't find yourself questioning it the way you might in a lesser movie.

While I said that the film's focus isn't on the characters, that's not to say that they're completely shallow. Kent and his family are likeable enough that you genuinely feel sad at their situation, even as you're looking forward to the next mauling. As well, the film isn't all gore. It utilizes a few clever techniques, such as only showing the full transformation of the clown through a low-quality video tape, letting your imagination decide the details. I also like it when a horror film does something I haven't seen before, and Clown's most original sequence takes place in the play area of a Chuck E. Cheese.

As all horror fans know, finding a genuinely good horror film is a struggle. It's unfortunate that this one wasn't released for US markets. But even if the film might not get the recognition it deserves, I'm glad that it exists.",1451001600,4,1745,4.680781758957655
