They are from different regions in Asia, so rather you love your horror from Korea or Thailand, you're covered! Plus, you save money by buying this collection together rather than buying them apart, so pick this up in time for Halloween!",1503446400,,342,4.716666666666667

8448778,3,B004YQXBBQ,"This 2009 collection of Thai and South Korean movies doesn't deliver in any way.

Having watched plenty of Eastern Asian horror flicks, I learned that Thai movies are usually sub par, thus my expectations were low for these mostly Thai films.

Diecovery, and The Commitment are straight up cheap and poorly done. Art of the Devil and The Unborn fare a little better, with more coherent plots and a more traditional approach to ghost stories.

The two South Korean movies in this set; Red Eye and Nightmare, are nothing special. Both are much better than any of their Thai counterparts but rely on cliches and are predictable (In the case of Nightmare, it is understandable as it is a 16 year old film now).

In short, a small collection of movies that the now defunct Tokyo Shock couldn't sell on their own (why would anyone license and distribute Diecocery is beyond my understanding), so they're packed in this affordable set.

Recommended to those who are REALLY into Asian Horror. Nightmare alone is worth the price if you can find this for $10 or less.",1481241600,,1057,4.7228260869565215
8448779,4,B004YQXBBQ,"Not all of the movies in this collection are good, but enough of them are to make it worth the purchase.  Diecovery is downright silly, it is filmed like a home movie and the acting is way too over the top and there is a too many scenes that are supposed to be sexy, I think, but are just stupid.  Art of the Devil isn't nearly as gross as they make it sound, but that's a plus to me, the story is pretty good though, worth watching.  The Commitment is okay, it has creepy moments, but the ending just doesn't gel.  Nightmare was pretty good, but was a bit dated.  I was distracted through parts of the movie by the main character wearing lip liner darker than her lipstick, don't know why that look was every popular.  I enjoyed Red Eye.  I had actually bought this movie separately, not paying close enough attention to the titles in this collection.  Set a horror movie on a train and I will always watch.  The Unborn was a decent movie as well.  The description is off, though.  The woman in the movie isn't about to give birth when she goes into the hospital, she finds out she is pregnant after someone tries to drown her and she ends up at the hospital, after that she starts seeing strange things.  I enjoyed it.  So while none of these movies is the best I have ever seen, the collection is worth owning.  The movies are all very different and you are sure to find a few that you like.",1476144000,,1394,4.231060606060606
