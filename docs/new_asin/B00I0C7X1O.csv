8637960,5,B00I0C7X1O,"Finally, with this Italian release, we have perhaps as good a presentation of Beyond the Forest as we are likely to get on home video as we know it. The print, albeit ""unrestored,"" is in relatively great shape, and the transfer provides plenty of revelatory detail. If you know the movie, you hardly need me to sell you on it, and if you don't, do treat yourself to one of the most unduly disparaged films of the 'forties, containing Bette Davis's most wanton wielding of hammer and tongs until Baby Jane, not to mention Luigi Martinati's great poster as the box cover art. Whatever the problem thwarting a domestic dvd release, anyone with a multi-region player will get full money's worth out of this for the jaw-dropping finale alone. hfs",1401148800,,741,4.707692307692308
