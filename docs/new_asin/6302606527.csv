This is the best presentation I've seen of this film. It's the ONLY complete print that's out there, since Universal burned all of their silent films in the 1940s. The soundtrack was added by someone as a labor of love in the 1950s (I'm guessing about the date) and has been married to this sole surviving print for decades. It's mostly classical / mideavel music recordings and commonly available sound FX overdubbed on the fly. Considering the tools at the guy's disposal at the time, he did a pretty good job.

The DVD is an improvement over the laserdisc because many of the scenes come from the original 35mm elements of this print, not from commonly available 16mm dupes.

The print is damaged, and some scenes have to revert to 16mm to make up for it. But this is all there is, take it or leave it.

Current DVDs of ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" look so much better because of it's re-release as an edited sound film in 1929. Since that print was officially a sound film, Universal didn't destroy it in the 1940s, when they otherwise burnt the negatives of the entire ""Phantom"" as well as ""The Hunchback"".

I found it much easier to watch this print due to the 35mm elements and actually found myself enjoying this rather slow movie. They also cleaned up the tacked-on soundtrack quite a bit, which made for a better experience. Give Image Entertainment a break; they did a good job on this one.

It's also getting hard to find, so grab it while you can.",1183852800,3,1563,4.524822695035461
7828534,2,6302606527,"To find 2 classic silent features on 1 DVD for a great price sounds like a dream, right? Unfortunately, the films are not in very good condition at all. The Hunchback of Notre Dame, featuring the amazing talents of the late Lon Chaney, is quite grainy so it's hard to see. Nosferatu never fails to give me chills but the music is all wrong! My guess is that someone just found a 10 minute score and just replayed it over and over again throughout the entire film without even giving thought to organizing it to play along with the scary scenes. Nosferatu's scary factor decreases when the intensity of the organ sounds when one of the characters opens the door and goes outside. And when Nosferatu does come into view, the music has somehow softened.

I give a star for both of these films since they are wonderful pieces from the silent era. However, I am a believer that music is important in films, so if you purchase this DVD, you may want to press the mute button on your remote control. In fact, for a couple more bucks, you can get restored versions of these classics. Do yourself a favor- don't buy this.",1135555200,,1112,4.450980392156863
