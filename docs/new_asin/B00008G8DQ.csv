7982798,3,B00008G8DQ,"Writer-director-actor Ron Ford and his good friend ""Film Star"" Randal Malone make the micro-budget ""Hollywood Mortuary"" entertaining in their own special way. This film has extremely low production values, but has a great concept and the pseudo-documentary framing device was a great idea. Amazingly, there is an Academy Award winner (Margaret O'Brien appearing as herself) in the cast and there are several other Hollywood legends appearing here, making this worth a look. Besides O'Brien, Anita Page, David DeCoteau, and Conrad Brooks all appear as celebrities being interviewed about the unlikely story of Hollywood makeup artist Pierce Jackson Dawn (Malone) who is released from his studio contract in 1941 and who uses voodoo (Brazilian Macumba) and murder to serve his purposes to force the studio to once again return to making his beloved monster movies by resurrecting the two biggest horror stars from the dead and unleashing mayhem on southern California.

The best parts of the film for me are the fake interviews with the real celebrities about Dawn: Conrad Brooks (as always) never quite gets his lines right, but he discusses Ed Wood at great length is what many will find the most surreally amusing part of the film. The premise is brilliant in that Dawn uses a voodoo ceremony that is beyond hilarious to raise arch enemies Pratt Borokof (Tim Sullivan) and Janos Blasko (Ford) from the dead to rally behind the horror genre. The parallels to Karloff and Lugosi are only too obvious. Great references to the famous pair include a great aping of the famous ""Pull the string!"" monologue from Lugosi; here Blasko goes with ""Pull the finger!"" (Oh, the hilarity!) Even the names are wryly done, with Pratt Borokof as the Karloff character; of course Karloff's real name was William Henry Pratt. Clever.

While the concepts are generally sound here, the film is uneven in execution, and some of the acting is exceptionally poor. The special effects budget was obviously small, and while Ford made do with what he had (some of the closing shots in the studio office are decent,) one scene in particular made me cringe, that being the worst shovel murder scene I have ever seen. Dawn gets a job at a mortuary to repair the damage to Borokov's face (post shovel interaction) and Blasko's body is quickly stolen in rapid succession. Though the interviewees pontificate at length about this, it's good old Conrad Brooks who steals the scene by explaining that while Blasko was Ed Wood's favorite actor (and of course Lugosi was in reality,) that Eddie didn't steal the body, if for no other reason than he couldn't afford a shovel! The film once again parallels reality explaining how Borokof turned down the role of Baron Vladimir, while of course, Karloff did turn down the role of Dracula. This is all punctuated by great dialogue in ridiculous English and Hungarian dialects; examples include ""You could not scare baby kitty cat"" and my all-time favorite line from the film wherein Borokof calls Blasko ""Goulash Head.""

After carefully setting up the Karloff/Lugosi...I mean the Borokof/Blasko...rivalry and mutual hatred, Ford does something unexpected and makes them team up as (kind of) friends and go on a murderous rampage as zombies. This made no real sense, but it did crank up the body count. The pair even get chummy enough to dance with each other at one point (pick your jaw up off the floor) and invade the worst comedy club in history. The ""comedian"" in question is going through a terrible routine, and for some reason has a reprise in the closing credits. I guess Ford had the footage and wanted to use it, but the whole comedy angle would have been wise to delete. The film closes with an explanation of how the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interfered directly to thwart Dawn (ponder) and the film comes to a close in a seedy Hollywood producer's office in a sordid set of scenes that go on far too long, but probably account for the bulk of the special effects budget. The closing credits are oddly edited, and you will know you've truly reached the end when you get to the scene of the cute puppy barking for his master. There is one extra, the ""Original Short Version"" of the film, which has terrible video quality, but is an interesting alternative to the long edit, especially inasmuch as it basically starts with the hilarious voodoo ceremony which takes a while to get to in the feature.

""Hollywood Mortuary"" is definitely not for everyone. It is a low budget spoof of Hollywood's golden age of monster movies from people who obviously love that era. In that way it sets itself apart from other similar movies, but while the guest stars are great, the acting and script are often weak, and the production values are bottom of the barrel. If you love old monster movies, you will likely enjoy this as you will get all the funny nuances Ford and Malone worked into the film; if you aren't especially passionate about the B-movie and classic horror genres, ""Hollywood Mortuary"" will try your patience.",1399766400,,5034,4.870478413068845
7982799,4,B00008G8DQ,"First off, I bought this for Randal Malone; second, I love funeral home related horror (of course, I love horror movies in general, but that's another story). In the age when Hollywood has given special fx make-up the boot, Jackson Pierce Dawn uses black magic to resurrect two horror movie stars (think Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff) and then forces them to wreck havoc on Tinseltown; we are given intermittant interviews within the movie to act as a sort of stylish documentary, but it actually gives the movie an Ed Wood feel. Randal Malone plays Jackson Pierce Dawn in an over the top turn that harkens back to dozens of low-budget flicks from the 60's throughout the 80's which starred the likes of John Carradine, Robert Forster, William Shatner, John Agar, Boris Karloff, Robert Foxworthy, Karen Black and Vincent Price; I've started searching for Malone's other films and there ARE at least a dozen in this genere; he's fast becoming the straight-to-DVD B-Horror king. I felt the conclusion was a little rushed, but was more than satisfied.",1349481600,,1048,4.926553672316384

But the tape wasn't what I thought it was . I read it wrong. I was dissapointed about that.

It's a movie about a horror effects artist who wants to bring back old horror stars. He has to dig up their bodies & turn them into zombies.",1255478400,,374,3.782051282051282
7982801,5,B00008G8DQ,Fans of old school horror will love this one. I did! The characters based on Lugosi and Karloff are extremely funny and  Randall Malone is the lead actor and he's perfect for this type of material (although Conrad Brooks steals the show). I loved every second of this and all fans of vintage horror should check out Hollywood Mortuary for a good time.,1103241600,10,351,4.571428571428571
7982802,1,B00008G8DQ,The movie was not that good to be a horror movie. I will give it a  0% beause it was boring!,1077062400,,92,3.380952380952381
