4386304,5,B004IF4EVY,"I learned about the history of Mexico in school. I was blown away to see the quality in every single detail in this miniseries about Mexico's Independence. Once I started watching the first episode, I couldn't stop! Everything about this series is captivating; the costumes, locations, characters, etc. I am SO glad I purchase it with English subtitles. If you like history,this is a MUST HAVE.",1330819200,4,394,4.984848484848484
4386305,1,B004IF4EVY,"i do not think this is a good movie for kids. the teacher of my child played this in the classroom and my child said ""she was afraid to watch it and it was scary""",1315267200,,162,3.657142857142857
4386306,5,B004IF4EVY,"I highly recommend watching this series to anyone who is interested in the history of Mxico.  I am mexican myself, and learned about this in school. But the series is full of interesting details that were new to me when I watched it, making it very exciting to watch even when I already knew what was going to happen.

It was worth every penny.",1311292800,9,344,4.359375
4386307,5,B004IF4EVY,"This 13 episode Mexican Miniseries covers roughly the Revolution's early efforts during the early 1800's. It is the equivalent of a BBC epic: Good direction, action, photography, accurate costumes and production values, and at the current Amazon price (under $12), a steal! Grab it, quick. You won't regret it. The story itself, coming from true historic events is much too convoluted to distill here; there are so many characters, it is sometimes difficult to follow. There are however clear English subtitles and written prologues before each episode to help the viewer. It took me 4 nights to watch, though a neighbor watched it in 2. A worthy effort from Televisa, hopefully with more to come.",1306281600,13,697,5.069565217391304

4386313,2,B004IF4EVY,"I watched this movie days after watching ""La Antorcha Encendida"" and I seriously can tell the difference between excellent actors and just fine actors. I just didn't like the actors at all. Miguel Hidalgo looks very scary and in my opinion all of them lack professionalism. I just didn't like it, It didn't give me the chills that one of the finest works Ernesto Alonso left us with 'La Antorcha Encendida"".",1373328000,2,407,4.746478873239437
4386314,4,B004IF4EVY,The movie gave a face and personality to historical figures in Mexico's past.  I thought there would be more scenes with Diego Luna in them.,1369008000,,140,4.6

It gave great incite about Mexico's history

4386316,5,B004IF4EVY,"Although I'm no historian or expert in the matter, I can only rate this from an entertainment perspective. This series captured my attention and I actually didn't stop watching it until it was over. I think I only took a break after finishing the first disk to use the facilites. I'm assuming that part of the captivating qualities of this was the actors chosen for the cast. The disclaimer itself reads that some liberties were taken in the telling of the story but that most historians or experts in the matter would agree with its depiction of the events. With this taken, I was truly amazed at how entertaining this series was, since most times that I've tried siting through a documentary I've only been mildly engaged. This of course, is no documentary but merely a dramatic retelling of Mexico's Independence. I definitely recommend it for those who want to learn a bit more about Mexico's history but who don't want to be bored out of their minds.",1362355200,5,955,4.690476190476191
4386317,3,B004IF4EVY,"Pretty good, not too bad in history, some of the locations and wardrobe were not realistic. Entertaining movie, could have been better, at least in my opinion.",1357603200,,159,4.925925925925926

8430638,5,B004IF4EVY,"This is a really clear, well-presented documentary of the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920. It's got really good actors and a chronological presentation. The only problem for would-be viewers is that it is only in Spanish.",1498089600,,221,5.3428571428571425

Very disappointing",1474761600,,148,6.095238095238095

8430642,5,B004IF4EVY,"Finally! Relevant Spanish-language movies ideal for High School. These 30-minute historical-based episodes are great for High School. I left 2 Chapters for my sub and when I returned my classes had questions for a lively discussion about the context for the Mexican Independence and its parallels to US Independence. These are well-done (they're not cheesy like so many of these kinds of things). The Spanish is easy to understand and chock-full of important vocabulary (abdicate, viceroy, Criollos). There are English subtitles (I did not find a way to remove them, but that does not mean they do not exist). No nudity, no foul language.",1428796800,5,638,5.144230769230769

It has a series of episodes that depict the War for Independence in Mexico, with subtitles, and is great to make that period come alive for my college class.
