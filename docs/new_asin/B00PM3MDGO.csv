6818146,5,B00PM3MDGO,"If you live in North America it's a shame you have to go all the way to Scotland to get this American made 1953 vintage 3-D gem but it's a hassle free purchase via Amazon and Marketplace Partner Panamint Cinema with quick Royal Mail Airmail delivery. ""Inferno"" is a very well made film noir (in Technicolor yet!) with the usual outstanding performance by Robert Ryan and a more than adequate supporting cast. Lucien Ballard's layered 3-D photography takes advantage of rugged desert scenery and Roy Baker's direction is stellar. Thanks to the 3D Film Archive (Bob Furmanek and the late Dan Symmes) for doing the first rate job on preservation and restoration. It looks GOOD!

Extras on the single region free Blu-ray disc include the 2D version of the feature, a theatrical trailer promoting the 3D version with Rhonda Fleming, another theatrical trailer for the 2D version, and a much more recent segment from with Pat Boone (on a religious TV network program) interviewing the still very lovely and gracious Rhonda Fleming. A 16 page booklet on the film is also included. If you want to see more of these vintage era 3D gems you might strongly consider purchasing this one, a time consuming and expensive labor of love for all who made it possible. Highly recommended!",1417564800,29,1270,4.852534562211981

6818148,4,B00PM3MDGO,good use of 3-d for depth...very little in your face stuff...film is well done and stands on it's own as a feature but the 3d is very well used and really adds to the film...I'll say this... there are two films I recommend having plenty of drinking water when you watch...This and Sahara with Bogart.,1442361600,,300,4.472727272727273

6818154,5,B00PM3MDGO,"this is the great region free version. Paramint at frist only put this out in region b and I bought that version. As I have a all region 3d player.  The film looks the same on either version but you want this brown colors box which is all region.  The restoration was done by 3d film archives I believe and it's very good with just a few scenes looking not so hot. BUT overall the film looks great and in 3d it's outstanding. Of course we get some great acting from the late great Robert Ryan who died too young back in the 1970's. This is a vintage 1953 film and it only makes me realize how sad it is that many other vintage 3d films are NOT out on 3d blu ray yet.  This one is a must have for any 3d fan though , and it's got a classic Hollywood crime story here and Robert Ryan's selfish and rotten character struggles to survive in the desert and he changes into a better man.  If you enjoy this please email paramint and twilight time to ask for more 3d titles. Also email universal and ask for their unreleased 3d titles as well.  You can buy some great vintage 3d titles though right now.  'kiss me kate'  , the house of wax"" ,  creature from the black lagoon'  , the bubble' , dragonfly squadron' , man in the dark""  amytiville 3d (as part of the amytiville trilogy boxset, yes the 3rd move is in 3d blu ray) , and 3d rarities'  are out right now.  with ""gog' (1953) and ""the mask"" (1961) coming out this year.  please go on twilight times facebook page and ask for more 3d titles.  The more people ask for 3d titles the more likely it is we will get them.  Universal has some 1950's titles that are not out yet.  email them.  paramount has some.

6818155,5,B00PM3MDGO,I had been hoping to find just a regular copy of this movie because it was a good story with one of my favorite actors Robert Ryan. It was to my surprise that it was again produced in the original 3D version. The movie was excellent and had some of the best south west desert cinematography of any film up to date. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in the 3D format. The movie was well worth the buy.,1435881600,,421,4.209876543209877

6818160,4,B00PM3MDGO,"I very much liked this movie.  The sound was raggedy in some places but that was expected.  The 3D was good.  I bought this movie without knowing anything except that it was from the 50s and in 3D.  I got more than I expected. I very much enjoyed it.  The movie was something like the book-soon-to-be-movie, 'Martian'.  We are often in the mind of the main character.  He is challenged by the desert and experiences a character change.  I also enjoyed his ingenuity most of all.

The 3D was used well to support the story.  There was not too much throwing things at the audience.

A note:  I contacted the seller, Panamint Cinema, immediately when I found the Blu-ray worked the second time I tried to play it.  I also corrected the original review below ASAP.  In spite of this the seller believes This review is responsible for a loss of sales and wrote me ""Next year we will be producing more classic 50s 3Ds. Don't ever order from us again.""

Previous Correction:  I havn't watched it yet.  I just wanted to change my review.  I put the disc in my my player and it worked!

The old review:  My copy does not work.  It only plays the 1953 preview.  I can't play the feature.  Panamint Cinema shipped a defective movie.  VERY dissappointing.",1434412800,,1243,4.4708520179372195

6818163,5,B00PM3MDGO,One of the best 3D films from 1953 looks absolutely wonderful  . Excellent color photography and superb depth and the fine  performance by Robert Ryan put this near the top of the purchase  list for all 3D fans .I enjoyed it as much as when I first saw it over 60 years ago.

6818164,4,B00PM3MDGO,"Inferno (20th Century Fox, 1953) has been categorized as a B movie (low-budget, second feature) or an example of Noir (crime melodrama, usually in black-and-white). At the very time Fox was beginning work on its blockbuster The Robe, (starring Richard Burton and Jean Simmons, in its new anamorphic process CinemaScope) the studio was trying to satisfy what they perceived as public demand for films in 3D which, by late 1953, was flagging. The project, starring Rhonda Fleming and Robert Ryan, was assigned to British director Roy Ward Baker and cinematographer Lucien Ballard. Its an entertaining and suspenseful film, clearly worth viewing - especially in 3D where the technology is effective in both immersing the viewer in the action and flinging objects through the screen at unexpected moments. The restoration was not an official studio job, but rather the work of Dan Symmes, co-author of the wonderful paperback Amazing 3D and technician with StereoVision. Its not perfect, but serviceable in making this obscure film available in somewhat near its original format. While the image is stable and well aligned, many of the scenes protrude through the window in an obtrusive manner. The color, from original Technicolor negatives, is exaggerated and often unnatural, marred further by blotches of green overlaying the blue skies. But there are some wonderful views of the desert included in those scenes depicting Ryans suspenseful descent from the mountain top on which he has been intentionally stranded by his wife and her lover. An informative, well-written booklet accompanies the region-free Blu-ray disk. Inferno, in this format, is available only from Panamint in the UK, whose service was impeccable. The company deserves thanks.",1429142400,,1746,5.375912408759124

6818168,5,B00PM3MDGO,"Great little color noir in 3D. It's amazing that the film can look this good considering that is was derived from film prints put together by independant film preservationists. The image is stabilized and perfectly aligned for an awesome 3D experience. Only while watching in the 2D mode will you notice age-related artifacts. One of the positive side effects of the 3D glasses is that they filter out most of the imperfections of the source material. 3D photography from this era is really intense, especially in the arial scenes looking down into the vast canyon below where Robert Ryan is stranded at the peak. While the original stereophonic tracks have been lost to time, the mono sound (in Dolby True HD) on this disc sounds as good as can be expected.
I hope that in cases like this where the studios aren't interested in putting out these vintage 3D movies themselves, that they will license more of them to small companies like Panamint.",1425600000,3,946,4.809815950920245

6818176,5,B00PM3MDGO,"The quality of the 3d is amazing, and deep and true. My eyeballs wanted to nibble the screen.  The 3D we see these days is so watered down and almost pontless in comparison. The story is a slow burn, and the pacing is deliberate.  It's kind of a western, not my usual choice of genre but it's a great item for 3D connoisseurs. Up there with House of Wax, the Bubble and Friday the 13th 3D in my book.",1422489600,2,400,4.050632911392405
6818177,4,B00PM3MDGO,"This was a better film than I thought it would be.  Simple but effective noir plot and a  good performance from Robert Ryan.  Rhonda Fleming was what would today be called ""hot"" and her performance was actually a bit nuanced. She doesn't play the cardboard wayward wife; her character appears unsure of what she's gotten herself into and equally unsure if she really cares about her new lover.  William Lundigan was a B lister and turned in a hack performance.  Some good performances from supporting players like Henry Hull and Larry Keating (next-door neighbor on Mr. Ed).

Technically, I don't really consider this a restoration.  The Technicolor is faded and the 3D depth is marginal.  But, while not a restoration, it is a fairly decent preservation, which 3D and Noir fans will be grateful for.",1422489600,,800,4.874074074074074
6818178,5,B00PM3MDGO,"Great looking 3D blu ray of a vintage 3D thriller.

6818179,4,B00PM3MDGO,"A real bit of nostalgia related to this 1953 3D production . Surprising to see the image quality throughly. A crystal clear picture with rich but not over saturated color. A very natural feeling of depth consistently.  Not much of the ""comin at ya"" gimmicks which might be expected from a first effort from 20th Century Fox.
Rhonda Fleming was a beautiful asset while Robert Ryan and William Lundigan
were competent and popular at the time.
As an audience we were so unsophisticated that we accepted this rather""sophomoric"" effort compared to today's high standard of acting and direction.  A great look at what was on offer in 1953.  Congrats to Paramint for this excellent print quality with no ""ghosting"" and such natural sense of depth...a great addition to my 3D library..... Hopefully ""Bwana Devil"" will be along soon!",1421280000,2,824,4.956521739130435

6818182,5,B00PM3MDGO,"Phenomenal vintage 3d release. Again Bob Furmanek and the team at 3d Film Archive have delivered the benchmark 3d restoration of the year! On top of which the movie itself is first rate. Classic film noir in technicolor superbly photographed by western specialist Lucien Ballard. The central performance by Robert Ryan is one his career's best. Roy Baker's direction is second only to his 1958 A NIGHT TO REMEMBER. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. With KISS ME KATE coming March 3rd there are few A grade 50's 3d'ers I need to make it feel like a complete set. Titles like HONDO (read this Paramount!), IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE,THE BOUNTY HUNTER,GUN FURY and STRANGER WORE A GUN would fill my bill very well.",1420502400,17,720,4.768
6818183,4,B00PM3MDGO,"When asked which films he did like which many he considered ""dogs"", the late Robert Ryan mentioned this 3D action thriller as well as ""The Wild Bunch"".  I saw this film several years ago in warehouse like theatre in Berkeley and was awed by the photography by Lucien Ballard (Wild Bunch).  I guess it made money for Fox being that it was their first 3D release since years later it was remade into a TV movie of the week starring Arthur Hill and Diana Muldaur called ""Ordeal"" but although Hill was good I think Ryan was much better and sympathetic as the alcoholic millionaire left to die in the desert by his unfaithful wife and lover played by lovely Rhonda Fleming and William Lundigan.  If you want a classic 3D movie from that era and am a Ryan fan like I am , do  buy this!  An update I received this a week and a half before the assumed delivery date of 01/28!! Considering the age of the film, this is a wonderful transfer and 3D definitely adds to it plus Ryan's excellent performance. Also a correction this was followed by the inferior ""Gorilla At Large"" with Cameron Mitchell, Anne Bancroft, Lee J Cobb, Raymond Burr and Lee Marvin.",1419984000,8,1144,4.454545454545454

6818185,4,B00PM3MDGO,"Ordered this as a ""blind buy"" out of curiosity and an interest in vintage 3D. Excellent depth throughout, with an occasional ""in your face"" effect (a chair thrown at the camera, etc.)  The opening title sequence is a little curious though--the titles seem to lay in the center of the field of depth instead of hovering in the  foreground, so that background objects appear to pop-out in front of the overlaid titles. I'm wondering if this was a goof in the restoration or in the original film. Other than that, the 3D effect was consistent throughout and well done. One minor pet peeve--the vintage trailer for the 3D presentation (itself in 2D) is ""watermarked"" in the bottom right corner (company logo appears). I hate when studios do this, but fortunately this occurs only on this single trailer and not anywhere in the film. I ordered through Amazon from Panamint, the company that produces this disc, and it arrived from overseas in about 2 weeks, well ahead of the estimated delivery date.",1419120000,10,995,4.812865497076023

8688776,5,B00PM3MDGO,"A longtime favorite of mine, INFERNO began my fascination with 3d cinema back in the early 60's.  I saw it presented at a revival Theatre in South San Francisco, and since then have come to realize how lucky I was.  The projection was absolutely perfect, the bright Carbon Arc twin projectors were in unerring synchronization, the modest Stereo Sound filled the auditorium, and the print was clear as can be.  When Rhonda stood with her evocative dress, her eyes twinkling in 3d relief, the effect on a young man was completely overwhelming.

The film was from 1953, yet was in Technicolor, (matted) wide-screen, NaturalVision-like 3-D relief, Stereophonic Sound (which in a better auditorium could have provided a matrixed Surround Sound), plus a literate script, excellent Director and Cinematographer, and superb cast.

One of the 50-odd films from the Golden Age of 3D, shot using the two strip system (two cameras, two films prints), the films from this era provide the most natural looking on-screen 3D you can achieve.

8688780,5,B00PM3MDGO,"In 2010, when newly introduced displays allowed the 3D experience to be taken
into the homes and the first wave of Blu-ray releases surfaced, many were
disappointed to find that none of the classic films from the 50s era were getting
any representation.

For fans like myself who have been eager for a look at many of the 52 3D releases from
the format's golden age, it has been a rather painful wait that has required an exercise of
patience.  To date, the major studios have only released a small handful of popular titles
and others are slowly finding their way to the collector via smaller labels.  One such label,
Panamint Cinema (one of the Uk's longest  standing producers of archive DVD and Blu-ray
discs) has finally made Twentieth Century Fox's, Inferno, available to the collector.

Filmed in 1953 during the initial theatrical boom of 3D, Inferno is an American film noir
drama directed by Roy Ward Baker.  The story concerns business tycoon Donald Carson
(Robert Ryan) who falls off his horse, breaks his leg, and is left to die out in the Mojave desert
by his scheming wife, Geraldine (Rhonda Fleming) and her lover, Joseph Duncan (William
Lundigan).  The story constantly switches between the the two lovers attempting to cover
their tracks, believing they have succeeded in their efforts and Carson struggling to find a
means to survive just one more day.

Since having the pleasure of being introduced to classic 3D by none other than Bob
Furmanek, I have sort of gone into the mindset that I need to own everything from that
era that gets released to Blu-ray.  That can be a dangerous thing as I am not quite sure
how good most of those films really are.  As I purchase these films blindly, I get the feeling
that at some point, I'm going to get burned.  Though Inferno is considered a B-Movie, I don't
consider it a second-rate film by any means.  In fact, I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed
this film, immersing myself in its shady characters and story of one man's fight for survival
against all odds.  One of the most interesting facets of watching Robert Ryan in those desert
scenes is the ability to hear his inner thoughts aloud, which I thought added a very unique
perspective to the story.

Inferno was originally lensed in 3D by Lucien Ballard (Berlin Express and True Grit).  It was
restored six years ago by the late Daniel L. Symmes.  In speaking with 3DFilmArchive's
historian, Bob Furmanek, I was informed that there was some confusion at Fox over which
version to supply and they almost delivered a poor-quality anaglyphic master.  Fortunately,
Bob and his fellow 3-D historians, Greg Kintz and Jack Theakston, stepped in and were able
to insure the correct HD restoration master was used for the Blu-ray.

Mr. Furmanek has informed me that this release is particularly gratifying for him given the
fact that he received a phone call from a very grateful Roy Ward Baker in November of 1999:

He was quite proud of his subtle and dramatic use of stereoscopic cinematography on the 1953 classic INFERNO and lamented the fact that no original 3-D Technicolor prints had survived. (The Dinard British Film Festival saluted Mr. Baker in 1993 and was reduced to showing a flat black and white 16mm print.) When his editor Tony Sloman told him that I had found original dye transfer Technicolor 35mm left/right prints, he had the publisher stop the presses so he could modify the text. He called personally to express his gratitude and appreciation for my preservation efforts. We spoke for 20 minutes about his work on the film and he asked many questions about my work on the Archive. It was quite an honor.

So how does Inferno look in 3D Blu-ray?  In a word, ""stunning!""  Obviously, a lot
of care was put into a restoration effort that has cleaned up as much surface dirt,
abrasions and print damage as possible, while revealing an exceedingly well-detailed
image that allows the Technicolor to translate itself across the screen with all its
intended vibrance.  There's a scene late in the film where the scheming lovers
are conversing in a living room.  Fleming is wearing a blue dress and Lundigan is
wearing a blue suit.  It's rather astonishing to see the luxurious and richly saturated
colors within that scene.  In fact, I don't think you'll see Fleming's hair more vibrantly
red than it looks in this transfer.  Fortunately, the film retains what I imagine is its
original intended look with just the right amount of background grain.

The 3D itself is quite amazing as well.  One of the tests I like to do to gauge the
strength of 3D imagery is to take off my glasses and see how intense the image
blur is.  In most 3D films made today, there's not a significant amount of blur which
generally means poor separation.  Inferno has a very intensified blur level and when
wearing eyewear, you really get the sense of highly pronounced depth.  This is the
level of dimensionality I have come to expect from films of this period where rooms
have the feeling of spaciousness and distant objects seem to go on forever in the
background.  You just don't see this level of realism in any of the upconversions
that seem to be the staple of Hollywood 3D films of present day.

Blatant pop-out gimmickry is pretty much non-existent here.  There is an attempt
late in the film to throw a lantern towards the audience, but it never lunges itself
outwards.  However, interestingly, the brim of Robert Ryan's hat does seem to
poke itself outside of the screen on one or two occasions.

While watching the 3D Blu-ray presentation of Inferno, you will probably notice
some ""warts"" in the background associated with the limitations of the restoration,
but trust that these anomalies are ever-so-noticeable and hardly retract from the
spectacular transfer.  Additionally, I noticed no ghosting/crosstalk whatsoever.

The film's original three-channel stereophonic sound no longer survives.  The
provided mono track is sufficient, providing dialogue that is coherent.

Both the 3D and 2D versions of the film are contained on a single Blu-ray disc.
Included is the film's original theatrical trailer; Pat Boone interview with Rhonda
Fleming and an Illustrated Booklet.

Our friends from 3DFilmArchive have provided, for this release, the original teaser
trailer with Rhonda Fleming, which has not been seen anywhere since the summer
of 1953.  Bob Furmanek also sent some production history and data on the film for
the booklet's liner notes.

For those of us salivating over getting our hands on golden age classic 3D, Inferno
certainly is a worthy purchase.  The film is a fantastic representation of what the era
had to offer: a great matinee story and breathtaking 3D photography that brings a sense
of realism to the home screen that is not often matched in present day.  What more could
