The acting is awful, and the production values..., well, they must have spent $20 making this film. But like an old Mack Sennett comedy, they didn`t try to hide the bad acting and low production values, they just made them part of the comedy. Making fun of theirselves while making fun of Star Trek. After all, Star Trek was a low budget show with bad acting and bad special effects. These guys just took that to the extreme plus every cornball redneck joke you can think of.
All in all it`s a fun little film. And proof that you don`t need to spend big bucks to make an enjoyable movie. As I said, they must have spent 20 bucks making this movie, and it`s better than that 100 million dollar ""Chinese fire drill in outer space"" that they tried to call a Star Trek movie a year or two ago.",1314403200,,888,4.260355029585799
7899294,1,6305988269,"I watched a few minutes of this and found myself unable to watch any more.

Once my son, when he was eleven, left the DVD's out in the open and wouldn't pick up after himself, I removed all the DVD's from the room, stowed them away elsewhere and told him I'd wait two week before I brought one or two out at a time.

I left HICK TREK out. TV and Video addict that he was, he couldn't bear to bring himself to watching it. ""It's awful,"" he said.

When a little kid won't watch something like this, you know it's a pile of animal waste. Flies might like it.",1184976000,2,555,4.027272727272727
7899295,5,6305988269,"I love this movie,it kept me laughing from start to finish. People who watch it should remember this is not a Hollywood production even a low budget one. This is a home movie and keeping that in mind it is very well done. The script is pretty funny and imaginative;and I cannot knock the acting,since I have seen alot worse acting in some Hollywood movies. So just sit back in your lazyBoy and enjoy some down home entertainment.",1174953600,2,429,4.512820512820513
7899296,1,6305988269,"Rarely does a film this amazingly banal come along. This film is astoundingly (...), tragically insipid, ruthlessly stupid. I bought this film on the strength of a recommendation found here, and deeply repent having done so.
The complete lack of video quality is equalled only by an incredibly hackneyed dialog and plot, both of which plod laboriously into the universe of (...) doltism. What might have been a clever concept and amusing presentation instead turns out mindless, trite, dim-witted, pointless and inane.
I base my attitude toward any movie firstly on whether I was entertained. Seldom does a film completely fail to provide some entertainment value that I can derive from the experience. This film, however, leaves one feeling they have totally wasted time, and money, on this worthless (...)!
There are many things more entertaining than this film. A root canal, electroshock therapy, enduring a generous cavity search, or a bad case of gout would all provide far more entertainment value than found in Hick Trek.
I believe this film is so bad not even Troma wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.
Compare every bad film you ever watched in your whole life, and witness something worse than any of them in Hick Trek. It is heart-breakingly awful. Appallingly unpleasant and totally terrible. Don't bother with this dreadful waste of celluloid.
Hick Trek should boldly go where no film has gone before...
to a landfill somewhere!",1007856000,3,1442,5.063025210084033
