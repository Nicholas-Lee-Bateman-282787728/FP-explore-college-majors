8534028,4,B0091CHC7W,Fun to watch good explanation wish there had been more under saddle work,1450915200,,72,4.615384615384615
8534029,5,B0091CHC7W,"Riz does an awesome job of explaining every step in detail, and driving home very important points (like getting the leg lifts off a cluck alone).  I learned a lot about different whips! That might seem silly, but those things are often so important and over looked!",1429747200,,266,4.659574468085107
8534030,1,B0091CHC7W,"I bought this set a few months ago, but haven't been able to watch its content.  I was sent the ""PAL"" version, which is for Europe.  I live in California and this doesn't play on any of the dvd players that I tried.  I've contacted Riz Ilyas quite a few times and have yet to receive a reply.  All I want to do is exchange this version for the one that will play on United States players.  It seems that Riz Ilyas doesn't care about his customers once he has received his money.  I don't know if this set is any good, but I would never buy anything from a person with this lack of concern about his own product.",1409875200,,611,4.05
8534031,5,B0091CHC7W,"It is a really good instructional DVD, and a really fun one to. My only gripe is that in some segments the sound is a little low. It still manages to explain exactly how to correctly train a horse to piaffe and stay safe. It's certainly worth your time.",1390694400,,253,4.183673469387755
