The movie has such a captivating flow that persons of any age can watch and be entertained without the fear of  bad language, sex scenes, and modern violence popping up to give you an  unpleasant surprise.",924739200,,317,4.233333333333333
7822177,5,6302186080,"Being an avid reader since I was a child, I related to the stories closely.  The Never Ending Story is a fantastic story, taking us to the realms of imagination and wonder. Demonstrating the wonder found within a  good book. With the 'nothing' threatening to take it all away. When people  don't read. Part II stays with the same wonderful use of your own  imagination. I have seen both movies dozens of times. They are my most  favourite movies.  Don't ever buy number 3 it is aweful. They totally  messed up with the whole thing, nothing close to 1 & 2. Enjoy make sure  your kids see them.",924566400,,592,4.416666666666667
