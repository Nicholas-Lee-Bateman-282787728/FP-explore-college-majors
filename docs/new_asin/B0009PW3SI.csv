2311218,4,B0009PW3SI,"Backlash was a very good show! Coming out of Wrestlemania 21, you Batisa defending the World Heavyweight Championship against the man he beat for it.. Triple H. The Game vs. The Animal. Two. Hassan and Daivari targeted HBK, and he called friend to tag with on this event and it was the ""Immortal"" Hulk Hogan. You also two other great match ups with Shelton Benjamin defending the I-C Championship against ""Y2J"" Chris Jericho, in what was a hell of a opener. Great match. Then Edge battled Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match, what a brutal match it was. Backlash 2005 was an entertaining event and one you shpould check out if you have not. Also had a Tag Team Turmoil match for the Tag Titles and a Inter-gender tag match.",1389571200,,729,4.53030303030303

2311221,4,B0009PW3SI,"WWE SUMMERSLAM 2005

This was a pretty big event for me during the build up since my boy HBK was going to go in against Hulk Hogan. I had waited years to see Shawn or Bret get a real shot at him but like always politics were all in Hogan's favor.

1.[US TITLE]ORLANDO JORDAN VS CHRIS BENOIT-this has got to be one of the fastest matches in Summerslam history. I was expecting this one to go a little while and it literally was a little while, very little. They tie up and then there is a German suplex right into a crossface, Chris takes the title.

2. EDGE VS MATT HARDY-one of the most personal feuds of all time since the real life love triangle became the storyline. This match went no way like it should have in my opinion much like the storyline over all. It started out great with Hardy really taking it to Edge but it eventually turned into a squash match putting Edge way over. Basically a beat down with the ref stopping the match and awarding it to Edge.

3.[LADDER MATCH]REY MYSTERIO VS EDDIE GUERRERO-although this was one of the craziest storylines ever this match ended up being the best of the night. This match was full of action and had a good pace with some back and forth action. Rey of course the smaller man used his speed while Eddie was more of a bully in this match. Although there was interference from two people here it was still a great match.

4. KURT ANGLE VS EUGENE-this was a full on beat down more so than the Hardy match earlier. Angle demolishes Eugene and rightfully so honestly. This was to get his gold metals back and he does so in very brutal form. I love his recreating of the gold medal ceremony after he wins here.

5. UNDERTAKER VS RANDY ORTON-this was a pretty good match with Randy really trying to work Taker over. Of course comparisons will be made with their previous matches such as their Mania match. This has a bit of a slower pace than the previously mentioned match but was still good. Randy's dad in disguise makes an appearance here and helps his boy win.

6.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS CHRIS JERICHO-of course the story here at the time was Y2J with the backing the Raw GM Eric Bischoff trying to take the title from one John Cena. Now personally I think that this was a really good match. If you listen to the crowd this is one of the most dramatic of the night. This was before Cena was hearing mostly boos. During this time it was only half the crowd booing him, but the split made for an interesting crowd. Both guys brought their A game here and went all out in their performances. Still after a lot of back and forth action and near falls Cena finally nails his finisher for the win.
7.[WORLD TITLE STREET FIGHT]BATISTA VS JBL-this match was actually more fun than I thought it would, I remember thinking at the time it was going to be something of a snoozer. Thankfully both guys made it interesting and the stipulation helped. Both guys did well in this somewhat short match held in Batista's hometown. Batista of course keeps the belt after a Batista bomb and then a power bomb onto the ring steps.

8. SHAWN MICHAELS VS HULK HOGAN-now of course I was looking forward to this one more than any other. I was so looking forward to Hogan getting smoked in the ring because realistically he cannot compete with Shawn. I knew it would be a good match and like I thought it was because of Shawn. I hate that he had to sell for Hogan but his selling was very funny here. Still this is a fun match that of course sees Hogan win, should have been HBK with the win in my opinion. Shawn had me cracking up though with his over selling, so entertaining.

Over all this was a good event that had some good matches. It is far from the best Summerslam but still a good one for the collection. HBK should have won hands down in my opinion but what can I say, Hogan will always get his way with the promoters. I still even today wish he had been man enough to at least put Bret Hart over at Wrestlemania 9, or at the first King of the Ring or at least in WCW. You also can some good special features here like the next night on Raw and such, like HBK's mocking of Hogan.",1327363200,,4116,4.287001287001287
2311222,5,B0009PW3SI,"The God of wrestling steals the show as usual. Everyone who knocks Hogan's matches are missing the point. Hogan makes the crowd explode just by his presence. Sports entertainment is all about crowd reaction. It could be the most athletic match of all time, but if the crowd is not into the match who cares? Hogan always delivers the goods whether you like it or not. One single Hogan punch gets a bigger reaction than any of the great moves that HBK can do. Fantastic match between Hogan and HBK!",1309996800,,496,4.522222222222222
2311223,3,B0009PW3SI,"Watching this DVD now its hard to cope with how far WWE-WWF has fallen from the great PPV era's they had before.  They have 5 match PPV's now that are moreless longer episodes of Raw.  This DVD is a good effort and one of the last of its kind.  The main event...Hogan and HBK is good...only because of HBK.  His talent to pull ANYONE thru a good match is legendary.  He really pulls hard and must have been exhausted for dragging Hogans limp carcas thru a good match.  Hogan does Hogan, which is pretty much - he's lazy, he's a name, he's living off it for 20 years past its prime, he can't work, he is insistant on putting himself over at all costs, he will blade (bleed) to save from making a guy look good.  He wins the end.  HBK flops around like a fish.  He is truely one of the best ever.  Other matches on the show are good, terrible, and amazing.  Jericho...heel mind you pulls a Michaels and drags Cena thru the best match of his career, the crowd turns on Cena because he is just a work.  Beniot squashes Orlando Jordan on his way out of the company in 30 seconds to Beniot back when he was of the earth.  The remainder of the PPV is you basic WWE PPV matches you could have seen for free on Monday Night.",1266624000,,1215,4.141025641025641
2311224,3,B0009PW3SI,"in 2005 a pay-per-view took place in Washington DC it was called SummerSlam. it featured the following mathes:
  --Orlando Jordan defends his United States Championship against Chris benoit-The only comments I will make, is that it was way too short! Chris gets slapped in da face by Orlando, does a German Suplex and hits the Crippler Crossface...ding-ding! The end. 3/5
  --Up next, Matt has been dating Lita for six years, he gets injured...while healing he finds out Lita has been dating Edge. Matt gets pissed off, he attacks Edge, thus leading into Summerslam (For the record; this is around the time Lita quits WWE, due to so many fans taunting her by shouting ""you screwed Matt!"") It was highly anticipated...but it was too short and nothing really happens besides the fact that Matt Hardy got busted open. This was one of this matches that didn't live up to its hype. in the end, Edge wins. 2/5
  --Finally one of the best matches that I've ever witnessed! Eddie Guerrero proves that he really can beat Rey mysterio, which is pretty much much why they had a that crazy-ass feud. This match is between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio: Eddie loses to Rey at W21, Eddie beats Rey at Judgement Day--though actually Eddie was disqaulified but Eddie 'owned' Rey so it's technically a victory. Eddie knows a secret about Rey's son Dominick, which leads to the Great American Bash where Eddie loses--but he lies, and reveals that Eddie is actually Dominick's father, not Rey. Then Eddie draws up Custody Papers for Dominick, Rey challenges for a Ladder Match at SummerSlam, Eddie agrees; The winner, gains...custody of Dominick. You can expect a lot of action in a ladder match but this match, is by far the best! I don't want to give all the good stuff away so let me put it in a different way...Rey's luchadore/high flying skills match perfectly with Eddie's Technical/dirty skills, this match has so many OMG moments. it is an instant classic. To simply summarize the match, Mysterio and Guerrero tore the house down! It was arguably the best match of that year! It really is that good, see, to me--this match IS the Pay per View! The timing is perfect, the bumps look realistic, it's a shame how everyone focuses on the Michaels-Hogan match, which sucked...the Guerrero-Mysterio Ladder Match is a true Match, Wrestling with an Extreme Environment. 5/5
  --The next match is between Eugene vs Kurt Angle for Angle's Gold Medal: er...nothing good or bad about this match except that Kurt simply dominates the whole time, unto Eugene starts copying finishers from WWE Legends-ex. Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow from the Rock, and Stone Cold's Stunner, hell even Kurt's own Ankle lock. but in the end kurt wins after forcing Eugene to tap with the Ankle Lock! 3.5/5
  --Next Undertaker takes on the Legend Killer, Randy Orton: The match was rather enjoyable, but nothing special, just another typical match but it was all right. Randy powerslams Undertaker, wow, I didn't think anyone could power-slam the Undertaker considering how overrated he is! Undertaker simply pushes Randy away after attempting the RKO! Undertaker attempts Tombstone, then Randy attempts Tombstone, then and finally Undertaker hits the tombstone! but some guy distracts Undertaker, allowing Randy to hit the RKO, Randy wins. 3/5
  --The following match is for the WWE Championship! Between John Cena and Chris Jericho: it was actually pretty good, I was rooting for Jericho, man! I was dissapointed by the result but the match itself had a lot of back-and-forth action. Both superstars hit their finishers and signature moves on each other and it was pretty entertaining. Finally Cena wins with an F-U, what kind of finisher is that anyways? 4/5
  --The next match is for, the World Heavyweight Championship! Between Batista and JBL in a No-Disqualification Match: Okay again a big anticipated match but it didn't live up to its hype. Then again, it is JBL and Batista, two big dudes who can barely move in the ring and have absolutely no technical ability. Batista pretty much dominates the entire match, this was when Batista was highly overrated, and in the end he wins after a Batista Bomb on steel steps. I gave it three for the finishing move. 3/5
  --And finally the Main Event, Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Michaels in a Legend vs Icon Match: the match was really overrated if you ask me, the ladder Match between Eddie and Rey was better. Nothing really happens in this match, the only thing worth watching is Shawn Michaels, who oversells Hogan's moves. Anyways, Hogan ends the match with a leg drop.. 2/5

2311226,5,B0009PW3SI,"Summerslam 2005 was really a great show, only surpassed by Wrestlemania 21 that year. And all the matches kicked it up a notch on tradition, yet awkward storylines, to create a suprisingly entertaining event.

BENOIT vs. JORDAN - United States Championship: This match literally lasts less than 30 seconds, which honestly, is how long some of the matches should last. Going into the ppv, i certainly was looking forward to this, but the legnth of the contest, and the outcome, made it worth sitting thru.

EDGE vs. MATT HARDY: Another great match, with a real-life scenario twist in the middle. It got very violent and brutal fairly quickly, and Matt takes some kicks to the head that would make even the most casual WWE observer question their tactics. The match would ultimately be stopped, with Hardy declared unable to continue from the beating.

EDDIE GUERRERO vs. MYSTERIO - Ladder Match: Probably the only match on the card that, despite all the hype and promotion weeks before, wasn't anything special, or at least hadn't been seen before. The whole premise was based on a custody battle over Mysterio's son, in which his wife, along with Guerrero's, get involved. The only note on this bout was that it was one of the few times, if any, Guerrero and Mysterio were on ppv in a ladder match. Yet it was their fourth match of the year on ppv.

EUGENE vs. KURT ANGLE - For The Gold Medals: Absolutely ludicrous match, should have been featured on RAW the week before. Not to be misled, but Kurt Angle is a phenomenal wrestler, and usually his matches are top notch. But battling Eugene at a ppv? I advise you just skip through this one, cuz not even Christy Hemme at ringside is a highlight.

UNDERTAKER vs. RANDY ORTON: A rematch from Wrestlemania, although not as good as the former. Still, pretty entertaining bout with a nice suprise ending involving Orton's father Bob Jr. Undertaker on the other hand, proves he still got the stuff and Orton shines as well.

CHRIS JERICHO vs. JOHN CENA - WWE Championship: Before this match, I wasn't much of a fan of Y2J, and most definately not of Cena. However, this match goes to show how you can underestimate WWE's top talent. Jericho shows off his absolute best in the match, and the suspense was most certainly apparent. There are few points when you actually think Jericho is going to do it, but in the end, Cena as usual retains the title. For those of you who have not yet seen what Jericho can do in the ring, I recommend watching this epic match, but NOT for Cena. It is also worth mentioning it is Jericho's last ppv match for WWE until his return in late 2007.

JBL vs. BATISTA - World Heavyweight Championship: Not too bad, even if you can't stand to watch JBL. The hardcore element was brought in, and JBL takes a vicious spinebuster powerbomb on the steel steps. Batista is slowly proving at this time to be a fairly great champion.

HULK HOGAN vs. SHAWN MICHAELS: Power meets technique, and 80's meets the 90's in this highly anticipated contest. Hogan has most of the support for the match, and HBK pulls old tricks out of his hat from his heyday. These guys show you what wrestling was like in their respective times, with Hogan on traditional, and HBK more reckless and risk-taking. The DVD itself is worth owning just to have this one time only match, not to mention for historic or nostalgic value.

EXTRAS: Nothing too fancy. A segment with HBK mocking Hogan on ""Larry Bling"" is humorous, plus there's John Cena's music video from his recent CD. Also, the fallout from the WWE Title match is here, in which Jericho leaves the WWE in a ""Loser Gets Fired"" bout.",1232928000,,3629,4.622670807453416
2311227,4,B0009PW3SI,"I'm 3 years late to the party, but with ""BACKLASH 2008"" on the way, why not try to get a few people to enjoy a good PPV.  In my opinion, RAW's 2005 season was one of their best, especially because they mostly delivered on PPV broadcasts.  SmackDown would soon end up in the gutter for most of the year.  ""BACKLASH 2005"" has some good stuff in store for us:

1) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho v. Shelton Benjamin (champion)
---If you thought the ""TABOO TUESDAY 2004"" matchup between these two was good, this opener wipes the floor with its predecesor.  Jericho and Benjamin have always been excellent wrestlers, but when you pair either one with an opponent similar to themselves, classics are born!  Wicked counters, crisp technical wrestling, and one of the sweetest pinfalls finishes ever --- easily stole the PPV!
""8.5 out of 10""

2) Tag Team Turmoil for the World Tag Team Championships
---I was really surprised with this one.  All five teams made each contest feel like it had some weight.  The Heart Throbs (those Billy & Chuck ripoffs) opened the gauntlet and actually put on a solid wrestling contest.  La Resistance wasn't usually a team I cared for, but they did quite well tonight.  Simon Dean and Maven were the comic relief duo, but even they maintained some dignity.  The Hurricane & Rosey were a strong big-man-little-man team, and do show some good maneuvers here.  Finally, William Regal & Tajiri proved why they deserved be the champs at one point in their careers.  None of these 10 guys treated this as filler, and I'm glad I gave the Tag Team Turmoil a look.
""7.0 out of 10""

3) Last Man Standing Match
Edge vs. Chris Benoit
---I really like how this Last Man Standing Match was more of a physical one-on-one affair without too many weapons.  Benoit and Edge competing in an intense competition was enough to wear each other down for a possible 10 count.  But don't worry, there were some sweet weapons spots I won't give away.  The Manchester crowd really ate this one up, and I did for the most part.  I think the finish was a little weak, but that's just me.  Worthy of the Last Man Standing lineage.
""7.5 out of 10"" (would've been more with a better finish)

***Now here's where things slow down for a while.  First, Jerry Lawler brought out some Divas to hype their new magazine, only to have Chris Masters issue a Masterlock Challenge to an OVW woman in the crowd.  Not a bad segment, but it ran on way too long.***

4) Kane (w/ Lita) v. Viscera (w/ Trish Stratus - Women's champion)
---Not the worst match I've ever seen, but it was pretty bad.  It's thankfully short, plus the women at ringside added some nice tension.  The aftermath was kinda cool, too.  I remember this being built up decently on RAW, but the PPV climax fell way short.
""3.0 out of 10"" (even worse without the Divas)

5) Muhammad Hassan & Daivari v. Shawn Michaels & Hulk Hogan
---It's a Hogan tag match.  You should already know what you're getting into.  Hassan and HBK try to have some ground-grappling action before getting to that predictable climax.  I'm not too disappointed because I knew what to expect.  Hogan's had better matches in his later career, and the other three guys have done better work, too.  Hogan fans will probably get into it; I'm gonna call it a guiity pleasure.
""6.0 out of 10""

***Christian came out with Tyson Tomko to rant about not being on the PPV.  I can't blame him; thank God he had a classic WWE Championship match at the next RAW PPV.  Until then, Christian gave us an amusing little rap.***

6) World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H v. Batista (champion)
---Let me be clear: I did not want to see this one!  I think their ""WRESTLEMANIA 21"" was average at best, and that Batista (at the time) lost all momentum once he won the belt.  But the rematch at ""BACKLASH 2005"" was pretty solid.  HHH and Batista showcased some good psychology with the finisher attempts.  Plus, the Manchester crowd was much more into this than the Staples Center audience at ""WM 21"".  The ending seemed to come out of nowhere to me, plus I think it was a tad short.  But like most have said --- not nearly as good as the Hell-In-A-Cell Match from ""VENGEANCE 2005"", but much better than their first time grappling up.
""6.0 out of 10"" >>> WRESTLEMANIA 21
""7.0 out of 10"" >>> BACKLASH 2005
""8.5 out of 10"" >>> VENGEANCE 2005

OVERALL
---""BACKLASH 2005"" probably wouldn't have done the trick for me on PPV.  It would've been a pleasant diversion, nothing more.  However, time has been very good to this event.  Each match was given enough time to tell a story (about 15 minutes each), and the slow 30 minutes halfway through the PPV are bearable.  Plus, there are some good DVD bonuses: the pre-show match between Val Venis & Tyson Tomko would've been worthy of the PPV airtime, and the HBK/Hogan post-match interview is entertaining (and ironic just a few months before their grudge match).

I'm not gonna give this 5 stars, because that slow 30 minutes in the middle of the event slow everything down.  But I do highly recommend this DVD to those who missed out on it.",1207612800,,5096,4.582964601769912

this match was entertaining because if viscera wins trish has to sleep with him. The match overall was pretty good for a big man match. the length of the match also makes it easier to watch. The post match attack is great. 2.5/5

Winner: Chris Benoit 2/5

This match really started out very exciting, Edge speared Matt through the ropes and on to the floor, but the match ends after Matt gets busted open later on in the match and Edge wins due to lost of blood on Matt.
Winner: Edge 3.5/5

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio
Now this whole rivalry was based on who has custody of Rey's son, this wasn't the best ladder match but its worth seeing. Theres a point in the match where Eddie gets bodied droped off the ladder and on to another ladder and it seems like he would nver get up but he does. Overall pretty good ladder match.
Winner: Rey Mysterio 4/5

4) Kurt Angle vs. Eugene w/ Christy Hemme
This match was for Kurt's gold medals and I'm really glad Angle just destroys Eugene because Eugene shouldn't even be in the WWE and of course Angle wins. Sucks that this was Angle last Summer Slam but at least he went out as a winner.

I don't know what to say about this match, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either, it kind of went slow but a poor title match for RAW and this was also Jericho's last PPV, good thing this wasn't their main event.

8) ICON vs. LEGEND
Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan

I was in attendance and the show was good. The ladder match was very good, not the best ladder match, but had some great bumps and spots. Hardy and Edge was alright. If Hardy hadn't got himself in trouble with the writers and other people of importance he wouldn't have been made to look weak. Jericho shows why Cena was, and still is, not ready to hold the belt. His in-ring skills lack greatly, but maybe he will get better. Cena's gimmick doesn't help anything either. Orton and Taker's match was decent. Batista and JBL was short and very anti-climatic for being a match with no rules. Aaaannnnndddddddd now, the main event, where the man with the nickname ""the main event"" had to completely carry the match. Hogan does a suplex, yes, a suplex, and reverses every irish whip. Now, I know, the injuries play a part for Hogan's lack of, well, any in-ring skill now and it showed. Michaels carried the match by flopping around and comically acting like Hogan had any part in making this match. It is fun just because it is one of the biggest names, Hogan, and one of the greatest in-ring wrestlers ever, Michaels. Some will say Hogan carried his weight, but watch the match. You decide, but I'm willing to bet anything you come out thanking Michaels for doing what he did. Imagine if Cena or Batista were fighting Hogan. The match would have flopped. Too bad Hogan's backstage politicking prevented a rematch, which he has been known for for years, and, yes, Michaels has been known for it, but he has changed and was never as bad, according to shoot interviews and people inside the business. Watch the RAW the following night when Michael's mocks the match and was allowed to rip Hogan apart. It was because of Hogan refusing to win one and lose one, but oh well. This has become a ramble.

This will be a brawl. Cena will end up winning,his long awaited victory without the Canadian trash Edge cheating him outta it.

Batista's 2nd ppv match since returning, it will be good. Batista will win after pinning Booker,or Rey~as Batista turns heel.

Spirit Squad will interfere, but that won;t stop DX. Since DX is over after SummerSlam bc of HBK's knee, DX will win!

6. Legend vs Legend Killer Match Hulk Hogan vs Randy Orton-

Since Hogan has control over his matches& the outcomes he will win. Otherwise; Randy would win. He's the next Rock;Even better! Orton should win, but because of Hogan's HUGE ego he will of course win :[

Carlito will win the title.

Seeing that Trish will be leaving WWE due to a marriage in the fall(what I heard), she could possibly win. I think Melina could win though with the help of Nitro. So maybe, Melina will win!

10. ECW World Title Big Show vs RVD vs Kurt Angle-

Since RVD is the fan favorite[ even though he is a no good druggie)will beat up Show most of the time. and could win by pinning Angle. Although Angle could win the title. so I pick Angle",1153353600,,1502,4.470588235294118

I'm not sure who will win this, as WWE might be waiting until No Mercy before Batista wins the gold back and then he can retain until WrestleMania 23, but I'm still going with Batista. This match should be amazing, as Mysterio has become a great champion and Batista is the best on SmackDown! I'm guessing the 619 will be hit by Rey, but the West Coast Pop turned into Batista Bomb (hopefully).

Winner: (NEW WORLD CHAMPION) BATISTA

10/10

LAST ENCOUNTER - STREET FIGHT FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP - WWE CHAMPION EDGE VS. JOHN CENA

Edge won the WWE gold by pinning RVD on July 3rd edition of RAW, but it was Cena's F-U that knocked Van Dam out. Cena and Edge will most likely collide in a 'Last Encounter' Street Fight (No DQ/ No Holds Barred etc.), but Edge will definetly retain. Edge needs a longer titke reign this time, and Cena is rumoured to be going back to SmackDown! This match should be brutal, with Steel Chairs, Steel Ring Steps etc. Edge will hold onto the title until Unforgiven when he will lose to Randy Orton (who NEEDS another WWE/ World Championship reign) or maybe to Triple H.

Winner: WWE CHAMPION EDGE

9/10

LEGEND VS. LEGEND KILLER MATCH - HULK HOGAN VS. RANDY ORTON

I think that this is most likely gonna happen. Randy seems 'intruiged' by Hulk's daughter Brooke ove the last few weeks of RAW, and Orton has said on numerous interviews that he will fight Hogan sooner than later. Both men are undefeated in singles matches at SummerSlam, and Randy would end Hulk's record by 'killing' off the biggest Legend of all time! I don't like Hogan much, but he can wrestle well. Randy is the best in the business and always makes matches great, so this would be a classic match-up. (Randy can finally prove that he deserves a WWE Title shot!) If this match doesn't happen at SummerSlam, expect it to happen at July 15th's Saturday Night Main Event. Can't wait!

Winner: 'LEGEND KILLER' RANDY ORTON

10/10

2-ON-7 NO DQ HANDICAP MATCH - D-GENERATION X VS. SPIRIT SQUAD, SHANE & MR. MCMAHON

This match would be great, as long as it doesn't go in the main event instead of the WWE or World Championship matches. D-X will win, but they won't stay around after SummerSlam as HBK needs knee surgery and Triple H wants the WWE Championship...again. There will be blood, and lots of Sweet Chin Music and Pedigrees!

Winners: D-GENERATION X

8/10

ECW CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - ECW CHAMPION RVD VS. KURT ANGLE

This would be interesting to see, and RVD's ECW gold will be defended at SummerSlam against somebody, and Angle is the best on ECW besides Van Dam. RVD's high-flying extreme moves combined with Angle's great technical wrestling gives us a very unpredictable match-up, but I'm going with RVD.

Winner: ECW CHAMPION RVD

8/10

INTERPROMOTIONAL MATCH - UNDERTAKER VS. KANE

We have all seen this so many times before, but it would still be good to watch. Undertaker will win, but Kane will be the last man standing. Expect a few chokeslams, the Last Ride, and 'Taker's legendary Tombstone Piledriver! This should be the match that leads up to a Hell-in-a-Cell match at Survivor Series. Should be good.

Winner: UNDERTAKER

7/10

INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - I.C. CHAMPION JOHNNY NITRO VS. CARLITO

After seeing what happened at Vengeance between these two and Shelton Benjamin, this match should be great. Nitro will lose the gold here, and Carlio can take home what he should have won at Vengeance...now that's cool! Expect some brawling from Nitro, and some innovative high-flying moves from Carlito.

Winner: (NEW INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPION) CARLITO

9/10

UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - U.S. CHAMPION LASHLEY VS. CHRIS BENOIT

I have really got to like Lashley recently, and Benoit is a future Hall of Famer, so this match would be great. Chris Benoit will win back the U.S. title by rolling up Lashley. Look forward to it.

Winner: (NEW UNITED STATES CHAMPION) CHRIS BENOIT

7/10

NO DQ MATCH - MICK FOLEY (AS CACTUS JACK) VS. RIC FLAIR

I don't know if this will happen at SummerSlam or July's Saturday Night's Main Event or at Unforgiven, as there might be to many hardcore-style matches at SummerSlam for this to go ahead. If it does, it should be about as long as their Vengeance match, but with Barbed-Wire Tables, Steel Chairs, and Foley's favourite: the Barbed-Wire 2X4! Foley should win, as he needs a good singles win on PPV this year.

Winner: MICK FOLEY

2311243,3,B0009PW3SI,"1. WWE Intercontinental Championship Match: Shelton Benjamin (c) vs. Chris Jericho

This is one of the best openers I've ever seen. This is exactly what an opening match was meant to be: fast paced and exciting. Shelton and Jericho previously faced off at Taboo Tuesday 2004, where Jericho lost his title to Shelton. This match is much better, however, as these two work better together and put on good performances. This gets the crowd fired up and ready to go, because this is a great opener. 8.25/10

2. Tag Team Turmoil for the World Tag Team Championship

This match isn't bad, but its not really worth watching. None of the teams have anybody that stands out, its mostly card filler. Just skip this and on to the next match....4.5/10

3. Last Man Standing Match: Chris Benoit vs. Edge

This is a great match between these two. They use a ton of weapons and put on wonderful performances. This has a good pace and many memorable moments, as well as good wrestling along the way. This is a great way to come off of the Money in the Bank Ladder Match at Wrestlemania 21. Speaking of ladders, one makes a slight appearance, and Edge and Benoit make good use of it. I think Benoit should have won this one, but Edge gets the win (with help from the Money in the Bank briefcase) to keep his push going. 8.75/10

4. Kane w/ Lita vs. Viscera w/ Trish Stratus

I thought this would be an absolute train wreck, but it turned out to be not as horrifically awful as I imagined. Its actually relatively entertaining, but it is certainly no classic. These two big men are kind of slow, but its a short match so the pace is kept rather quick. Not required viewing, but you won't want to chug the stuff under the sink while watching it either. 4.5/10

5. Shawn Michaels & Hulk Hogan vs. Muhammad Hassan & Daivari

The ""Dream Team"" of HBK and the Hulkster make this one as entertaining as it can be. While Hulk is a little slower then he used to be, he can still make a match fun and exciting with his undeniable charisma and ring presence. Hassan and Daivari, however, can't really do much in the ring, and aren't very good. Still, Hulk and HBK find a way, like they always do, to make their matches entertain the fans. The crowd is hugely behind Hogan here, which is no suprise to anybody who has ever seen Hulk wrestle with a crowd that is awake. HBK and Hogan do a few cool double team moves, and make a good tag team. This is meant as a fun match, and thats what it ends up being. Hassan and Daivari barely contribute, but it doesn't hurt the match too much. Watch this to have fun, not to watch a wrestling classic. 7.5/10

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista (c) vs. Triple H

The much anticipated rematch from Wrestlemania, where Batista beat HHH for the title. Though this match starts out a little bit slow, it builds into a good match. Theres a nice spot with the ringside barricade, and some good wrestling throughout. Nothing spectacular, but a solid, well paced match thats worth viewing. Probably as good as their Wrestlemania match, but not better. 8.25/10

Backlash 2005 was a good way to continue after Wrestlemania 21, and provided us with four entertaining matches. Not amazing, but a solid card with some good matches throughout.

Match of the Night: Last Man Standing match: Benoit vs. Edge. This match was very good, and a good way to give Edge a push while making him look like something special. They use a bunch of weapons and get quite creative at times, making this an exciting, well wrestled match that shouldn't be passed up.",1151798400,9,3557,4.504658385093168

2311257,4,B0009PW3SI,"1. United States Championship Match: Orlando Jordan (c) vs. Chris Benoit
Only a 20 second match. Its so short its actually quite humorous. Beyond me why this was the opener, but its not like the WWE hasn't made stupid decisions before. I don't even know if this can get a rating because of its length. I suppose a 4/10, for humor purposes.

2. Matt Hardy vs. Edge
Good fued behind this one, and it started out very brutal, so I thought I was in for a good match. Then, a little less then 10 minutes in, its over because of Matt Hardy's ""blood loss"". Another short match WWE? Come now, give us something that is at a proper length! Worth a look, but I wouldn't watch it again because its too short and too little happens. Another generous 5/10, this show is off to bad start.

3. Ladder Match for Custody of Dominic: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio
I think the storyline behind this was absolutely awful and ridiculously overdramatic, and that these two faced each other far too many times in one year. However, regardless of poor back story and quite a few botched spots (that are quite funny actually, because they look painful), its a very entertaining match. These two put on a good show, providing us with the first good match of the night. A few entertaining spots and a great pace. 7/10

4. Winner Gets Kurt's Medals: Eugene vs. Kurt Angle
What posessed WWE to put a no talent hack against two of the best the company has ever seen at two Summerslams in a row? (Eugene faced HHH the year before at Summerslam 04) My opinion of Eugene aside, Angle basically wrecks him, and the match is over. Didn't really serve much of a purpose, since its quite predictable, but at least Eugene takes a beating. What Angle does to Eugene after the match is quite humorous as well. Another generous 5/10. (Anybody noticing a trend here?)

5. Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker
This was an excellent fued. Though their match at Wrestlemania 21 was better, this is still a very good match. Screwjob ending, but at least it continued their fued. These two put on good performances and work very well together in the ring. Poor ending, but still a good match. 8/10

6. WWE Championship Match: John Cena (c) vs. Chris Jericho
I've always said that Jericho is one of the most underrated wrestlers I've ever seen, and its matches like this that prove it. Nobody ever talks about the performances he puts on, even though they are very good. This is a great match thats very back and forth. The crowd is extremely into this one, and they seem pretty evenly split between the two men. ""Let's go Cena"" and ""Let's go Jericho"" chants echo through the arena for about 50% of the match, which makes it that much more exciting. One of Cena's better title defenses, a very good match. 8.5/10

7. No Holds Barred Match for the World Heavyweight Championship: Batista (c) vs. JBL
JBL is a great heel character, and Batista is booming in popularity at this point. They put on a good performance here, but its a little short, falling in at about 10 minutes or so. A couple nice spots, and the ending is great. They mix pretty well, but this match is nothing to write home about. Still a good bout, and definitely worth watching. 7.5/10

8. Legend vs. Icon: Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels
A great fued, with Shawn returning to his old heel ways that we had not seen for many years. Great match, these two both put on great performances, though I do believe that Michaels carries Hogan quite a bit. The crowd is very pro-Hogan, as expected. This is a very good match between these two, they both give it their all. One of the better matches of the year, I really enjoyed this one. 9/10

Though this starts off on the wrong foot, this is overall a good Summerslam. Only a couple hiccups in the card, but even so, they are still watchable. The only reason they received relatively low ratings was because of either a terrible finish or underwhelming length. The undercard isn't anything special other then the Ladder match, but the uppercard is excellent. Two good title bouts and two great fued matches make this a great Summerslam.

Match of the Night: Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels. As usual, Shawn puts on a great performance, and Hogan is a good entertainer. They work very well together and provide an excellent match. As previously mentioned, one of the better matches of 2005.",1148083200,2,4344,4.544757033248082
2311258,3,B0009PW3SI,"Honestly, SummerSlam came off to me as a an episode of RAW & SmackDown smashed together for 3 hours instead of one of top top PPV's of the year because there were too many squash matches on here.

US Champion Orlando Jordan vs Chris Benoit - This match was really short.  How short, well for the next couple of weeks...Benoit did skits showing he could make a cup of coffee & take a piss longer than it took for him to make Jordan tap out.  Literally, it was less than 45 seconds.

Edge vs Matt Hardy - WWE had this angle involing these two & Lita that had everyone talking about and awaiting for these two to just kill each other but to say they dropped the ball here is a major understatement.  Hardy got busted open early & Edge just beat him down until the referee stopped the match after around 10 mins.  Basically another squash match.

Ladder Match: Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero - It was a great ladder match eventhough the storyline got stupid with the whole ""Dominic is my son"" thing going on (well, it did result in the ""I'm Your Papi"" shirt so I guess it's not all bad).  Lots of interference from Vicki Guerrero & Dominic himself but it didn't ruin the match itself.

Eugene vs Kurt Angle - Another squash match as Kurt Angle just beat the holy hell out of Eugene the whole time.  Besides Christy Hemme in a cheerleader outfit, nothing else to add here.

Undertaker vs Randy Orton - This didn't live up to their previous match but it's still good.

WWE Champion John Cena vs Chris Jericho - The crowd was split & really into this one making it better than it was.  Jericho made Cena look like a million bucks here.

Street Fight Match: World Champion Batista vs JBL - This match was pretty short & sweet but if you saw their Great American Bash match, you'll know why.  Batista was also in his hometown so he put on one of this best performances given the conditions.

Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Michaels - The storyline was something (can you say ""SHOOT"") as the crowd was split again.  But overall, this was mostly just HBK bumping & selling for Hogan and getting the occassional spots in before Hogan makes his comeback.

Somewhere on here was a skit with the divas in their bikinis washing Vince's limo with a ""McMahon for President"" bumper sticker but you've seen these girls in their bikini's & skimpy underwear so many times, it's nothing special.

1. WWE U.S Championship

Chris Benoit vs. Orlando Jordan

This is one of the shortest U.S Title Matches. It would be the shortest if Diesal didn't win the WWE title in 8 Seconds. Jordan is the most sorriest excuses of a champion. Tapping to the Crossface in 23 seconds. Benoit deserves this title

2. Matt Hardy vs. Edge

This was a desent match. Edge and Hardy can really duke it out.

3. Ladder Match(Winner gets custody of Dominick)

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero

Rey's first Ladder match. Possibly one of the best Ladder matches ever. In my opinion Better than TLC. Rey wins it. Eddie can sure deliver when it comes to ladder matches.

4. Olympic Medal Match

Kurt Angle vs. Eugene

Well you know Kurt is gonna win this. Eugene beat him in his Olympic challenge. That day I laughed but a basic match.

5. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Not as great as WM but good. Bob orton interfeirs but still good showing

6. WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho

Best John Cena match. Jericho's last PPV apperance. But Cena wins with FU

7. No Holds Barred Match

JBL vs. Batista(World Heavyweight Championship)

VERY BRUTAL. NOT FOR THE WEAK AT HEART. BATISTA WINS WITH BASTISTA BOMB ON THE STAIRS

8. Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan

The best Hulk match in some time. These 2 stole the show. Michaels did his best but you can't beat Hulkamania. Great Build up",1144108800,2,1437,4.556862745098039
2311272,2,B0009PW3SI,"That's an oxymoron, right? Can one possibly be a fan and NOT be biased? Of course you can. In my 21 year old life, I've followed the wrestling scene of WWE(WWF) and WCW since 1992. I've witnessed the rise of WCW, I had to watch the downfall of the WWF; WCW collapsed under the weight of its many stars and considerable mismanagement, the WWF worked hard to reach the top again, which it did.

There were changes, ups and downs, legendary matches and real turkeys, great gimmicks and unbelievable laughing stocks; but they all had one thing in common: the rule always was wrestling first, gimmick second.

When Vince McMahon signed the contract to buy WCW, I was at first quite excited. McMahon had the single most powerful weapon in his hand that anyone in this business ever had ... and made nothing of it. After the excitement of seeing your WCW favourites wrestle your WWF favourites lost its touch, I lost interest in pro wrestling, also because it vanished from German free TV, and I smelled that the future wouldn't be worth the money.

Two, three years passed (without any knowledge of what was going on) until I saw the Summerslam 2005 DVD at my store.

I suddenly got a little excited again, and popped it into my DVD player, and I soon realised two things: firstly, I miss WCW, and secondly, times have changed. Now the rule is gimmick first, wrestling second.

I don't know where to start. Maybe with the first match, Chris Benoit vs Orlando Jordan. Benoit was always underused in WCW, and I hoped it would get better in the now called WWE. It did, but only for a short period it seems. How do you get from World Champion to someone who participates in the opener? Benoit wins the US Title in about 20 seconds, and it didn't make any sense. Poor ""match"".

Then Matt Hardy vs Edge. The storyline looks believable, but the match itself was not worthy of a Summerslam (or any other PPV). Of course one should have expected a hard brawl, but this is largely a fist fight inside a wrestling ring, and it completely lacks tension. You would have expected Lita to turn on Edge, but it doesn't happen. Edge punches Matt Hardy's lights out, and that was it after about 5 minutes.

Does this PPV become even remotely entertaining?

Yes it does in the ladder match between Rey Misterio and the late Eddie Guerrero. With all due respect to Rey and the deceased, they have fought greater battles. Which doesn't mean that this match is bad, it's not. It's just a little too stiff and too long. Eddie and Rey are often too concerned about what to do with the ladder instead of creating a well- flowing match.

The end is satisfying, but not overly spectacular.

The Kurt Angle vs Eugene match also belongs to the forgettable parts of the evening. Not only does it fail to live up to Summerslam's legacy, it is also pretty poor when compared to Angle's past efforts. Yes, he wins, big deal.

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton match was by faaaar the best match of the evening, second only to Hogan vs Michaels. Good tension and nice intensity. And yet I can't help but feel that the ominous Undertaker gimmick starts to become pathetic. You can only ride a horse for so long.

John Cena vs Chris Jericho was probably the most painful match of the evening. Not because of its brutality, but because of the radical contrast between fact and fairness. In fact, John Cena is still the champion, but it would have been fair to give it to Jericho. He carried the match, he dominated it, he gave the better performance, and yet Cena beats him straight in the middle of the ring. Something more pathetic I've never seen.

Batista vs JBL for the heavyweight title (by the way, whoever came up with the idea of that rotating globe on the belt should be shot) was also utmost forgettable. I couldn't help but ask myself ""THIS is what the PPV fights for the world title look like these days?"" A short hardcore fight with the usual objects, no title change.

The main event, Hogan vs Michaels, seemed strangley separated from the rest of the PPV, not even the commentators mention it once. I have to say, of all the matches, this was the one I had the severest doubts about. I saw neither Hogan nor Michaels fight for ages, but they delivered one of the best matches I've seen. It shows that Hulk Hogan can still be believable on the brink of losing the match, but rise from the ashes in the next moment as convincingly as ever.

After a dramatic fight, Hogan pins Michaels under the thunderous applause of the audience.

If there's one grain of salt, it's that the WWE seems to be dependant on old superstars, and that's no wonder, we just sat through some of the worst world champions ever.

I don't like this Summerslam, except for two matches, and this is for several reasons. All the matches, except Hogan vs Michaels, lack a storyline within the match. And most unfortunately, tension and interest in a match is created by a storyline. It might be that the younger wrestlers aren't experienced enough yet, but then don't give them a title for heaven's sake!

Plus the matches are so out of focus, and simply unbelievable. After two minutes John Cena rolls on the mat like he couldn't go on anymore, no wonder these matches are so uninteresting when there's no physical development in them. Or are the WWE's fitness standards way too low?

Lastly, I don't have the feeling like I'm watching something special.

Look, such an event is called a ""Pay Per View"", which usually means you have to pay for it, but you'll see something you can't see anywhere else.

During the whole event I felt like I'm watching an overly long Raw episode, just without the story bits.

In this shape, the WWE looks like the walking dead 2001- WCW in a most alarming way. Too bad Vinnie Mac deleted the only real competitor several years ago, so he has to find out of this crisis alone.",1143590400,5,5846,4.531813865147199

1. Chris Benoit vs. Orlando Jordan(U.S. Championship)

This is tough to rate seeing as it was only 23 seconds, so I'll just give it an average rating. 6 out of 10.

2. Matt Hardy vs. Edge

This match had potential to be good because of the first 5 minutes,but when Matt Hardy hit his head on the steel post,the ref was forced to stop the match. There was a cool spear through the ropes though. 6 out of 10.

3. Ladder Match(Winner gets custody of Dominick)

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero(R.I.P.)

This was an amazing match and one of my favorite Ladder matches. This was a great way to end the feud. Everytime you thought that the match was going to end,it didn't. Great high-flying moves and this is a match that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. 10 out of 10.

4. Kurt Angle vs. Eugene(Winner gets the gold medal)

This was kind of short. It was pretty easy to tell who was going to win because Kurt had to win his medal back. Still, a pretty solid match. 7 out of 10.

5. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Great match. Their Wrestlemania match was a little better,but this is still a good match. Taker got robbed at the end though. This was a good continuation of the rivalry which eventually culminated at Armageddon in a Hell In A Cell Match. 8 out of 10.

6. John Cena vs. Chris Jericho(WWE Championship)

The crowd was really into this one and it didn't disappoint. I wasn't expecting the match to be this good. I was really pulling for Jericho to win and I think it sucked that he got fired soon after. Great match throughout. 9 out of 10.

7. No Holds Barred Match

JBL vs. Batista(World Heavyweight Championship)

This was a disappoint. I was expecting this to be one of the best matches but it wasn't. Now don't get me wrong;it was good,but it was way too short for a No Holds Barred Match. I did like the Batista Bomb on the steel steps though. 8 out of 10.

8. Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan

I was expecting this to be horrible,but I was proven wrong. It wasn't a match of the year candidate like people are saying,but it was still great. Hogan was busted open and there was good action throughout. Plus,the class shown by Shawn at the end was great. 9 out of 10.",1141171200,4,2275,4.300469483568075

this was a total blood blath, there was much hype for this 3 way encounted as all three men had a huge crush on each other... so it started with big show throwing springer outside the cell and into the grave, once springer was disabled, show attacked hulk hogan and started playing with his old wrinkely boobs.  he almost sucked them right off...hogan retaled by grabbing shows ball with all his might and ripping them off and then eating them both.....once show was on the ground crying spring came back in and attacked hogan, he pulled out a steal dildo and pocked hogans eye out with it, over and over and over until hogan was competely blind, hogan just laid there in his own blood and started crapping his pants and screeming BROTHER, BROTHER, BROOOTHER!!!!!!!!! meanwhile show regained his mind and body and spirit and homosexuality and attacked spring full force with all his might.....he started stuffing springer into his stomach in an attempt to eat him with his fat belly....it was horrible, then springer pulled out a knife and stabbed show and then stuffed him into the boiler and melted his head,,,,,,,,,, hogan ripped out the refs eyes and put them in his head, he grabbes spring and flew into the sky and did a super magic, brother brother bomb and slamed springer through the top of the cell into the grave, and ripped off his thong to eliminate him from the match.  Show meanwhie was climbing to the top of the cell show jumped on hogan crushing him flat and humped him for at least 35 minutes before hogan died..... then show ripped of hogans thong and wone the match...yes this was a great match indeed...... in the end the cell collapes and show fell through but he was hugn from teh top when his thong caught on to the shard from the cell, he dangeled there for 2 hours before the thong cut off all his circulation and he died......

winner: show, but really no one

rating: ........ ummm 1/this is great

conclusion: i know what all you loser are thinking, yes this summerlsam 2005 was the best ppv of all time.... i hope this review helpped you all on making your decisions in life....... by the way, you can by it for a meisely $400.00 dollars at your local family dollar store...peace out homies...until lata",1136592000,6,5140,4.642699115044247

  This match disappointed me.  They made so much hype for this brawl for like weeks and behind the scenes, months, but in the end they had to call the match cause hardy got hurt.  The fans expected to see a much longer and much better match

match three: Rey vs. Eddie in a ladder match for custody of dominick

  Ok yo! this match was off da hook.  I loved it all the way thruogh. At first i didn't really like this rivalry cause of the flow of things, then i started to get into it and after i watched this match, i was in total awe.  Those two put on possibely the match of the night.  I really liked it when rey feel from the brief case and eddie power bombed him.

  with some help from eddies wife rey wins  9/10

match four: Eugene vs. Kurt Angle for angles gold medals

Ok, it was so obvious angle was gonna kick the crap out of eugene and win his medals back you need to be smacked in the face if you thought eugene was gonna win.  It wasn't a horrible match but coulda been better

 angle wins (obviousely) 6/10

match five: Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

 I liked this match, i saw it coming that orton was gonna beat taker. Of course it wasn't fair, that was obvious.  Ortons daddy (and probabely lover) had to come to the rescue like always.  it was a good match overall but not as good as there match and mania

 orton wins (with help from his daddy)  7/10

match six: John Cena vs. Chris Jericho for the wwe title

  Ok just let me first say, Cena is my favorite wrestler and i am sick of all the smack people are talkin about him.  He is a great champion and poeple need to shut up.. I understand many people say he is to young, and a lot of people of turned there backs on him, some for good reason, but i think he has great potential, and that couldn't of been more obvious then in this match.  Like the rey and eddie match this was the other candidate for match of the night.  There was great hype for it and it turned out a lot better then a thought (mostely cause i didn't really like jericho i just didn't care about it that much).  Cena and jericho tore the house down and i loved it

 cena retains the title after a monstrous f-u  8/10

match seven: Jbl vs. Batista for the world title

 I would not put this match on my all time favorites list.  I was satisfied but not overwhelmed.  It was to short and not enough happened.  But there were some good times like when batista ramed jbl through the barricade.  I also liked the ending and jbl was batista bombed onto the steel steps

 batista wins and retains title  7/10

match eight: Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels

 first just let me sey, hogan is a wrinkled old loser and needs to learn when to stop.  That might make some people mad, but i just don't like the guy.  I really wish michaels would have one.  The match had some pleasing points, but it would have been better if it wasn't so long and it would have been more even instead of back and forth domination.

2311296,5,B0009PW3SI,"And boy, Did i get what i expected and more! This summerslam was a wrestling event that entertained non-stop [Despite the presence of a couple of weak matches]. I was able to enjoy this summerslam from beginning to end and i'll tell you this, It far surpasses 2004's summerslam! Enough of that, Let's get into the matches:

1. For the Wwe U.S. Title
Champion Orlando Jordan Vs. Chris Benoit
Match ended in 30 seconds, So this was much too short for me to even give a positive rating to. Before you even know it, Benoit made Jordan tap to the crossface and he became the new U.S. champion. No stars for the much too little time that was put into this match. This did not effect my overall opinion on this show one bit.

2. Matt Hardy Vs. Edge
Another short match. This was longer than the first match, But this match also ended much too quickly. Match was stopped due to Matt's massive bleeding, Therefore, Edge won. These guys had some problems with each other in real life over lita. *

3. Ladder match for the custody of Dominick
Eddie Guerrero [RIP] Vs. Rey Mysterio
Now, This is what i'm talking about. This match was full of intense hardcore action from 2 of the most talented guys in wrestling today. Guerrero and Mysterio put on 1 hell of a match here. This is arguably one of the best wrestling matches i've seen all year. This long but very worthwile feud is, In my opinion, One of the top 5 Wwe feuds of the year. Even Dominick himself got in the ring at one point in an effort to stop Guerrero from winning. Guerrero's wife Vicki even showed up at the end of the match and was the one that costed him this match, Resulting in what was yet another victory for Mysterio over his friend-turned-foe Eddie Guerrero. This is yet another match that the late great Eddie Guerrero should be remembered for. I and many other wrestling fans will always miss Eddie Guerrero. *****

4. For Kurt Angle's olympic gold medals
Eugene Vs. Kurt Angle
This match was ok. There was some nice action throughout and despite the obvious outcome of the match, The match remained watchable. Angle regains his gold medals. ***

5. The Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton
This rematch from Wrestlemania 21 is a pretty good match. I never seen Wrestlemania 21, So i can't comment on that match. But i can comment on this one, And i'll say, That The Undertaker still manages to remain potent after 15 years of being in the Wwe. Randy Orton has stepped up his wrestling game even more over this past year. I was expecting Taker to win again, But thanks to interference from Orton's dad, The legendary Bob Orton, Jr., Randy Orton catches Undertaker off guard with an rko and he gets the victory in this match. This match was a continuation of another one of the Wwe's hottest feuds of 2005. Taker and Orton wrestled each other yet again just a few weeks ago at armageddon in a hell in a cell match. This match was good and it should appeal to wrestling fans. ****

6. For the Wwe World Heavyweight Title
Champion John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho
Finally, I see Cena give an impressive title defense match for a change! I still don't look at cena as being that good of a wrestler [Even though i really like his music], But he did a real good job against Jericho here. The match is fast-paced and highly enjoyable and the only real dissapointment that comes from this match is its ending where Cena retains his title yet again. This match was great, But that belt needs to be taken away from Cena now! Cena is far too weak of a wrestler for me [And many others] to even buy him being the World champion this long. But other than that, A very nice match. ****1/2

7. No holds barred match for the World Heavyweight Title
Champion Batista Vs. JBL
This match was unexpectedly short, Probably clocking in at barely 12 minutes. This match was ok. It had its fair share of hardcore action. The moment that stands out in this match is in the end where Batista powerbombs JBL onto the steel steps. That's a memorable moment to me right there. Anyway, This match was decent. Not the best match on here, But at least it's good enough to sit through to the end. Batista retains the title in this match. ***

8. Shawn Michaels Vs. Hulk Hogan
This was the entire reason i wanted this dvd in the first place. This match features my all-time favorite wrestler [Hogan] taking on another one of my all-time favorite wrestlers [Shawn Michaels] and the results for me was just too good. I enjoyed this match thoroughly from beginning to end and i never took my eyes off the screen when i watched this match. It was a back and forth match which saw Hogan bleed a lot. Shawn Michaels done a nice job as always but it is Hulk Hogan that's truly amazing because at over 50 years old, He's still putting on classic matches like this. Shawn Michaels proved in this feud that he can still be a very effective and very entertaining heel. This is the greatest match of this event and for all those who wanted 1 more classic match from Hulk Hogan, We truly got it in this match. Both of these guys still got my respect and this match shows that even though he's past his prime, Hogan remains a very entertaining and extremely likable wrestler. Hogan won this match. Shawn Michaels even shook Hogan's hand at the end of the match and turned back to a face after only a few weeks of being a heel during his feud with Hogan. Hope to see a rematch between these two before Hogan really can't wrestle anymore! ***** [Best match on the event]

This was a classic summerslam and this pay-per-view is probably the best pay-per-view that Wwe has put on this year. For all Wwe fans and wrestling fans, I surely reccomend this dvd to you! I'm highly confident that very few will dislike this show. Hope this review helped. Be blessed, And i'm out.",1135468800,,5770,4.435849056603773

Winner: Batista

Match 8

Hulk Hogan vs. HBK

This was good, but it was too one sided. First Hogan dominates, then HBK. HBK hit Hogan with the Sweet Chin Music and he put the sharpshooter on Hogan, but in the end Hogan Hulk up and hit the leg drop and won.

Winner:Hulk Hogan

Rating: 8/10 ( It was good, but it was no Rock vs. Hogan)

All in all, Summerslam 2005 was good Pay-Per View, it has some upsetting matches ( example: Edge vs. MAtt Hardy, Eugene vs. Kurt Angle), but there were some good matches as well (example: Eddie vs. Rey, Cena vs. Jericho). So it was not to bad.

A superb match that had everything a ladder match should have - intensity; high flying moves and psychology. This match definitely won me over and lived up to my high expectations.

RATING: 82/100

Hogan vs. HBK

Here is a match that I found very hard to review. The reason for this is because of the first 10 minutes: The first half of the match really had me fearing what I never expected; a bad performance from HBK - I mean there were so many very exaggerated moves from Michaels that I just didn't understand and I must say that I have never seen him like that before. Very luckily HBK calmed down a bit towards the last half and the last 5 minutes were good.

I don't know, maybe I was just expecting too much

RATING: 80/100

Batista vs. JBL

1 complaint first - Far too short as another 10 minutes of hard shots would have greatly improved this and perhaps would have won it about 5 to 10 more points. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this 9min match as it was much better that their so so GAB match and the ending of this one really put a smile on my face . The ending definitely also won it a few more points.

RATING: 81/100

Cena vs. Y2J

A very good match that surpassed my expectations and it had some good spots. Perhaps a few more minutes and more high flying moves would have got this one into the 90s, but not today

Orlando Jordan v. Chris Benoit DUD

This match was really too short to even be called a match. This ISN'T the way to start your second biggest show of the year. Benoit being US champ makes sense I guess, but give us an actual match.

Matt Hardy v. Edge **3/4

This was a very different match that people just didn't get. This was booked to be a brawl and it was as close to a real brawl as you'll get. Two guys wanting to kill each other get in a wild fist fight, one guy catches the bad break, other guy capitalizes and it's broken up when someone is clearly down and beaten. That's the basic jiist of this match, but if you're looking for good stuff, you're better off finding a tape of their street fight on Raw, or their Cage match at Unforgiven.

Ladder Match

Eddie Guererro v. Rey Mysterio ***1/2

Another fun encounter between these two, but you can't help but think that the lame storyline held this whole program back. A great ladder match with some great, innovative stuff with a rather silly ending. IMO, the best match of the evening but part of me still can't help but feel marginally dissapointed.

Eugene v. Kurt Angle **

Really just a glorified squash match for Kurt Angle. This had the potential to be very good given both men's technical prowess in the ring, but with Eugene booked to look like an idiot, this was just what most smart fans were expecting. A huge let down.

Randy Orton v. The Undertaker ***1/4

Just as good as their Wrestlemania match. No better no worse this time with Orton going over. This was really Orton's return match for all intents and purposes and he performed very, very well. This feud was really the one that put Orton back on the map in the WWE.

WWE Championship

Chris Jericho v. John Cena ***1/4

A very solid match. For whatever misgivings folks have about John Cena, he does deliver in pay per view matches and this was no exception. A solid bout technically and psychologically. Just a shame Jericho couldn't bring this work rate to the ring every night. Good, solid World title match.

World Heavyweight Championship-No Holds Barred

Batista v. JBL **

This may take the taco as the worst feud of the year. These two had absolutely zero chemistry. I don't peg things on JBL nor Batista. This is just a case of two guys having the capatablility of a pin and a balloon. JBL does what he does best in this, which is bump and bump often, while Batista tosses him around some more. No real psychology or anything. It's a shame JBL's getting crap here because he really is a superb worker although not the best in ring performer... this match isn't his or anyone else's fault. With Hassan being booted off television a month earlier, this was thrown together rather quickly and WWE was lucky it didn't totally bomb.

Icon v. Icon

Shawn Michaels v. Hulk Hogan ***

This is a fun match. But don't kid yourself... it's not GOOD. Michaels sold like a crazy man for Hogan and Hogan bled. That was pretty much it. Good stuff with Hogan obviously being the power man and HBK being played up to be the more ajile and wiley of the two, although Hogan isn't above pulling a fast one if he has to. Fun match with a decent story told.

Overall B-: This is a solid card overall. Nothing really bombed minus the Smackdown title match and nothing really totally outdid anything else. Though there's not a single WWE Match of the Year candidate on this show, it's one of WWE's stronger top to bottom offerings of the year. Enjoy!",1132790400,,3495,4.47244094488189

10/10 i loved it  but the fans didn't need to boo him like that....you know

.batista vs jbl

i thought i was going to get a slobberknocker but i got a bad match

i got this dvd/ man i wish if  i was a wrestler i can disobey the prodecers and  keep the match going. untill its very late.micheals and hogan had to much damn time wich was stupid. at first they startted slow.  tryin to waste time. thats sad. this was a good match  6.10 /should have been longer.

hogan vs micheals.

i only like the end becacse it has a low blow. a chair shot. a elbow drop

and a sweet chin music. and a hogan finish. but the begiining was just punchng. slapping. slow brawl. the should have  fought out the ring.

should had did a superplex at leadt. or a body slam on hogan.

or a powerbomb. but not really  exciting moments except for ending.

10/10 stilll great i was in shock after the match. and there was blood",1130025600,,2234,3.8903803131991053

Orlando Jordan vs Chris Benoit 8/10- gets a good rating due to the element of surprise. flashback to the 1st Summerslam in 1987.

excellent segment in the locker room with Eddie & Vicki Guerrero.

Edge(w/ Lita) vs Matt Hardy 8/10- this 2 have real life isues with each other over Lita. surprised WWE let these 2 near each other. the punches look real at times. stunning end to the match. swear this looks like a shoot match.

Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio 10/10- much better than their G.A.B. match. this is the match of the year! these 2 lay it all out like they use to years ago. action packed from start to finish.you can't help but to root for Rey. even Tazz does!

No Time Limit Gold Medal Match

Eugene vs Kurt Angle 5/10- thought this was going to be a good match since Eugene got Kurt's medals on Raw. way too short & nothing extraordinary. more like a Raw thing than Summerslam caliber.

excellent backstage segment with Vince McMahon & the divas.

Randy Orton vs Undertaker 7.5/10- not a bad match but not a good followup to Wrestlemania. has its good moments. screwjob ending creates a shocking surprise.

John Cena vs Chris Jericho 9/10- was expecting a dud but this was a great match. Chris carries John well. fans excitement helps out . they were really into it.

World Heavyweight Championship

No Holds Barred

Batista vs John Bradshaw Layfield 8.5/10- not a bad match but could have been so much better. should have been longer. ends too quick. thought this was going to be the main event but see why it wasn't.

Shawn Michaels vs Hulk Hogan 10/10- 1st time ever for these 2. figured this was going to be a terrible match. boy, was i wrong!

wish these 2 had fought 10 years ago when they were in their prime. Hulk at 52 & Shawn at 41 didn't figure to offer much. these 2 put on a show as they turned back the clock. even with a plastic hip, Hogan still looked decent. Michaels does a great job of carrying the match at times. reminds me of Hogan-Rock at Wrestlemania 18. the crowd was all into this. surprised as this match went past 20 minutes. a match of the decade! this is probably the Hulkster's last match.

best Summerslam in awhile. the extras are a must see with Shawn Michael's parody of the Hulkster, John Cena's video & the next night on Raw. the best PPV since Wrestlemania. haven't seen a ppv in a long time with 2 ""10"" rating matches on it. the worst match was a ""5"".",1130025600,,2496,4.460352422907489

The third match I liked was the Undertaker vs Randy Orton match. Unfortunately, I had to give this match a 7/10 because of its bad ending. A stranger interfered in the match,causing Undertaker to get distracted. Orton took advantage and RKOed Undertaker. He got the pin.

The show was kicked off with the National Anthem by Lilian Garcia.

1st match: Orlando Jordan (C) vs. Chris Benoit for the United States Championship:

I had left the room to go get a soda and when I came back, Jordan was tapping!  The match was way to short for my liking.

Winner via submission: Chris Benoit

Rating: 2/10

Backstage: Eddie talks with his wife and they get into an arguement about Dominick.  Good build-up to the Ladder Match.

2nd match: Edge vs. Matt Hardy:

This one was just brutal.  These two beat the living hell out of each other.  In the end, Edge just punched the hell out of Hardy and he was bleeding like crazy.  Edge just kept on giving him knees and punches.  Edge then mounted him and gave him more punches!  Edge then kicked Hardy in the face and the ref had to call it!  This was just punch after punch.

Winner via KO: Edge

Rating: 4/10

3rd Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero in a Ladder Match for the Custody of Dominick:

This was an pretty good match but the ending was bad.  Here you go:  Eddie gave Rey the three amigos with the last one on the ladder!  Eddie then climbed but his wife, Vicky ran down.  Eddie grabbed the briefcase but his wife tipped the ladder over!  Rey then gets up and climbs the ladder but Eddie grabs it.  Eddie's wife then pulls him away from the ladder and Rey pulls down the breifcase!  Now how dumb is it to have a man's wife screw him up in a great match!?

Winner via getting the briefcase: Rey Mysterio

Grisham interviews Jericho about his match with Cena.  Jericho says he will become the next WWE Champion and he was the first Undisputed Champion ever.

4th match: Eugene vs. Kurt Angle in an Olympic Gold Medal No Time Limit Match:

Everybody knew that Ange would win.  Here is the end: Angle kicked the hell out of Eugene and sent him into the corner but Eugene got pissed and started to fight back.  Eugene fought back and hit the Rock Bottom but Angle kicked out.  Eugene then went for the Stunner but Angle reversed and went for the Angle Slam but Eugene reversed and hit the Stunner but Angle kicked out.  Eugene tried to put the Ankle Lock on but Angle reversed and put in on Eugene!  Eugene tapped.  The reason it wasn't good was because Angle was going to win and you knew it.

Backstage:

The Diva Car Wash.  A waist of like 5 minutes.  Funny stuff though with Vince for President!

5th match: Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker:

This was a pretty good rematch but I think I liked WM 21 a little better.  This here was decent.  Here is the end: (Here is the greatest reverse combo ever) Orton went for the RKO but Taker tossed him away and went for the Tombstone but Orton reversed and went for the Tombstone but Taker reversed and they both kept reversering! Orton went up top for a crossbody but Taker caught him by the throat and hit a Chokeslam! A guy in the seats ran out and distracted Taker, he turned around and walked into the RKO for the win!  Like I said, a good ending.

I already knew the outcoming going into this match which took away from it.  The end: Jericho had Cena in the Walls of Jericho and Cena tried for the ropes but Jericho pulled him back!  At this point I thought that Cena might actually tap!  Cena fights to the ropes but this time he makes it!  Jericho then kicked Cena in the head and went to the top.  Cena then ran up and went for the FU but Jericho reversed and hit a huge superplex!  This time I knew Jericho had it!  Instead of covering he ran at him, and Cena caught him and hit the FU for the win!  The match had me going at the end but I knew the outcome.

7th match: Batista (C) vs. John Bradshaw Layfied for the World Heavyweight Championship in a No Holds Barred Match:

This was pretty much a squash and I was pissed at how short it was.  The end: JBL went to powerbomb Batista onto the steps but Batista reversed.  Batista then hit JBL with a Spinebuster.  Batista then hit the Batista Bomb and got to 2 but stopped, mixed JBL up and gave him the Batista Bomb onto the steps for the win!  This was way to quick and should have been more brutal.

Winner via Pinfall: Batista

Main Event: Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels: Icon vs. Legend:

There was so much build-up to it that there was no way you couldn't like it.  I had no clue who would win.  The End: HBK went outside the ring and grabbed a chair and nailed Hogan with it.  HBK then hit the elbow drop on Hogan and I thought he had it.  HBK tuned up the band as the ref came to and HBK nailed the Sweet Chin Music!  Hogan somehow kicked out!!!!  I knocked over my table of food I was so shocked!  Hogan then did his usually Hulk-Up and gave HBK the Big Boot followed by the Leg Drop and Hogan wins!  This was great!

Overall: I though SummerSlam was decent and it could have been a lot better.",1127692800,,5358,4.294472361809045
2311322,4,B0009PW3SI,"All in all, this SummerSlam wasn't bad at all! Considering the only real name match going into it was Hulk Hogan Vs. Shawn Michaels, I think everyone put in a good effort on their matches. Here is the rundown:

Chris Benoit Vs. Orlando Jordan (U.S. Title Match) - This match is awesome not because it was a great bout, but because of the way it ended! I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it but let me put it to you this way. DO NOT TAKE A BATHROOM BREAK DURING THIS MATCH BECAUSE IT'LL BE OVER BY THEN!

Matt Hardy Vs. Edge - This was what everyone expected, no wrestling holds, just a fight! Would've liked to have seen it go longer than it did but hey, it did set up two spetacular matches since this one!

PERSONAL NOTE: If any of this angle is really real, then I have to give it to Matt Hardy and Edge because I know if I was taking on a guy that in real life stoled my woman, that match would turn REALLY REAL REALLY FAST! And I certainly wouldn't want to be Edge, looking across the ring and seeing a guy whose girl (Lita/Amy Dumas) I took!

Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Gurrerro (Ladder Match) - While I hate the angle that spawned this match, THE MATCH ITSELF WAS AWESOME! A lot of sick spots and a surprising ending that was foreshadowed earlier in the night.

Eugene Vs. Kurt Angle - Surprisingly, most of the Washington D.C. crowd was behind Angle in this one! Speaking of him, I have to admit, he made Eugene seem pretty formadible at times, proving he's one of the best workers out there. Still, this was pretty much a squash.

PERSONAL NOTE: While I am not a fan of Christy Hemme, I have to admit she was looking good in that cheerleader's outfit. Also will note that the Diva's Car Wash was looking good too! ;)

Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - I think this one was even better than their original WrestleMania match! There was better ring psychology in this one as both men gave a good effort with another sneaky plan by Randy Orton which this time, unlike WM, paid off!

John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho (WWE Title Match) - Have to give both men credit. Jericho is the superior wrestler and performer but John Cena kept up with him pretty well! The crowd was hot for this one as half were for Cena but at least half were for Jericho! Both men got applause though at the end of this bout and deservedly so.

Batista Vs. JBL (World Heavyweight Title/No Holds Barred) - This one wasn't as violent as I thought it should've been. It was an okay bout BUT I will say that the ending is reminiscent of the most famous moment from the Batista/HHH Hell In The Cell in June of 2005 and it does involve steel steps!

PERSONAL NOTE: I realize its the commentator's job to build up the wrestlers but how ignorant could TAZZ (which surprised me) and Michael Cole (which didn't surprise me) be?! They said this match favored JBL! HELLO, DIDN'T BATISTA JUST DEFEAT HHH A FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS MATCH IN A HELL IN THE CELL BOUT?! ""THE GAME"", WHILE NOT A FAVORITE OF MINE, IS CERTAINLY BETTER THAN JBL AND MORE PROVEN!

Not saying that Cole and TAZZ didn't have a point but still, I am surprised this point was failed to be pointed out!

Hulk Hogan Vs. Shawn Michaels - An historic bout, no doubt about it! Not the greatest I've ever seen BUT it was electric! Much like Hogan Vs. Rock at WrestleMania 18, the crowd was as much the star of the match as the two wrestlers! Seeing Hogan bleed was also a sight as well!

EXTRAS:

Shawn Michaels on ""Larry Bling"" - A very hilarious skit! Probably the best comedy HBK has done since his old Degeneration X days! Certainly the best extra on this DVD!

""Right Now"" music video by John Cena - Not too impressed by this but I actually like this tune! Cena is no LL Cool J, 50 Cent or even Eminem BUT I will say that he's actually better than a lot of so called mainstream rappers out there right now! Still, he better not quit the job that made him!

""THE NEXT NIGHT ON RAW"" - A highlight of the aftermatch of Cena/Jericho. I wished they would've actuall shown the match on RAW rather than just clips but you'll get the idea of it.

Overall, a good buy for your money.",1127606400,3,4106,4.263835263835264
2311323,5,B0009PW3SI,"I was one of several lucky people who to attend this great PPV.  I hadn't been to a WWE show in 10 years, and I had never been to a PPV before.  WHat an awesome experience!

Match 1 - Orlando Jordan (c) vs. Chris Benoit: United States Championship

Wow this one was a quickie.  OJ gets some cheap shots in, and then Benoit hits him with a German Suplex, then locks in The Crossface and it is over at 25.5 seconds.  The crowd popped HUGE for Benoit.  It was like he had just become World Champion.  Nice little surprise to get the crowd on their feet.

Rating: 1/10 for the match, but that gets bumped up to about 8/10 just for the crowd reaction and the mere shock of what happened.

Match 2 - Edge w/Lita vs. Matt Hardy

How disappoiting.  I expected something really good from this match, and as we saw in their Streetfight and Cage match since Summerslam, they can put on great matches together.  This match started off great when out of nowhere Hardy got busted open on the ring post.  That looked sick, but then the referee stopped the match and declared Edge the winner.  To say the crowd was confused would be putting it mildly.  This match should have been one of the highlights of the show, but it was only it's greatest disappointment.  What a shame!

Rating - 3/10

Match 3 - Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio: Ladder Match

Holy Moly this was awesome! There was a lot of sick stuff here.  The scariest spot was when Eddie looked like he was going to give Rey an electric chair off the ladder.  That would have been nasty, but Rey spun around on Eddie's shoulders and flip powerbombed Eddie off the ladder! There was also a 619 onto the ladder into Eddie's face. They also did a good job of tying in all the stories by having Eddie's wife interfere and Dominic got involed as well. Overall there was a lot of cool stuff here, and one of my favorite matches of the night.  Eddie lost to Rey for the 6,000th time, this time thanks to his wife.

Rating - 9/10

Match 4 - Eugene w/Christy Hemme vs. Kurt Angle: Gold Medal Challenge

OK this match was ruined for me.  I think I may have been the only one in the entire building who was rooting for Eugene.  It was sad.  I like Angle, but I like him as a HEEL.  I like booing him, because he's bad and he's good at making me hate him.  Apparently the DC crowd didn't see it my way, and poor Eugene got horribly booed, and it was by far the most negative reaction of the night.  What a shame.  The actual moves in the match were fine, but the crowd put a damper on it for me.  Angle picked up the win with The Ankle Lock, which was the smart way to go.

Rating - 5/10

Match 5 - The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton: Legend vs. Legend Killer Part II

Oh sweetness! I loved their match at Wrestlemania 21, and this one was certainly a worthy sequel.  Lots of good psychology with Orton working over Taker's leg, and there was also alot of sweet big boots from Taker.  I loved the Tombstone spot.  Taker picked Orton up for The Tombstone Pilerdriver, but Orton flipped over, but then Taker flipped back, but then Orton flipped behind Taker and hit his unique neckbreaker! The ending was a bit of a mess as almost nobody recognized it was Bob Orton who helped Randy as it looked like a mess when he took the mask off.  Anyways, Randy won with the RKO after antoehr stellar match between these two.

Oh and BTW, Undertaker's entrance is freakin' awesome live! TV doesn't do it justice.

Rating - 9.5/10

Match 6 - John Cena {c} vs. Chris Jericho: WWE Championship

Boy was I pleasently surprised with this match.  There are two reasons as to why.

1) I haven't been that impressed with Cena's work over the last year or so, but this match was actually very good, and my pick for second best match of the night.

2) I thought I was going to be the onyl Jericho fan in the building, but the crowd was 50/50! That was awesome to be a part of the ""Let's go Cena!"" ""Let's go Jericho!"" chants. It made my night.

Cena picked up the win with the FU which was no surprise, but Jericho came extremely close with several attempts with The Walls of Jericho.  Overall, this was a great match!

Rating - 10/10

Match 7 - Batista {c} vs. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield : World Heavyweight Championship No Holds Barred Match

Now I think I might be the only internet fan who actually liked the match these two had at The Great American Bash.  It wasn't great, btu I don't think it was nearly as bad as everyone said it was.

But this is Summerslam, and let's talk about this one.  First of all, Batista was over HUGE with the hometown crowd.  That was certainly a nice homecoming for him.  JBL came out with confetti and the JBL 100 Dollar bills comign from the ceiling.  I wanted one of those bills, but they came nowhere near my section.  Oh well.  The match itself was a little short for a world title match, but still very cool.  Batista speared JBL through the security wall while they braweled through the crowd.  That got a huge reaction.  JBL gto back the advantage and then whipped Batista with a leather strap, and hit The Clothesline from Hell for only a two count.  He broguth in the steel steps, but that only led to Batista giving him his sick Spinebuster and then The Batista Bomb! Crowd was going nuts at this poitn as Batista then gave JBL another Batista Bomb on the Steel steps! 123 it's over.

Batista then looked into the camera, grabbed one of the JBL dollar bills and tore it in half.  That was cool.  This match wasn't as violent as people expected, but that's because Hogan/Michaels was going to have a nsty blade job and so did Hardy/Edge and I guess WWE didn't want to over do it with the blood.  Entertainign match over all.

Rating - 8/10

Main Event - The Immortal Hulk Hogan vs. ""The Heartbreak Kid"" Shawn Michaels: Legend vs. Icon

WOW! WOW! WOW! Hulk Hogan had been one of my childhood heroes, but I never got to see him live before.  What a tremendous experience! Hogan truly does transcend wrestling.  There was definately a magical atmosphere when he came out.

Of course I don't mean to sell HBK short at all.  I've seen HBK live before and he's just plain awesome.  Aside from Bret Hart, Michaels is probably the most talented wrestler to ever step in the ring.  I have wanted a Michaels vs. Hogan match, and I finally got it, and I got to see it live and in person no less.  It was obvious that this was the match that the people wanted to see as they were jacked up for it.

The match was amazing.  I know people are going to disagree with me, but it's my pick for Match of the Year.  I loved it.  For 52 years old, Hogan looked very good in there, and worked very hard.  And Shawn Michaels is Shawn Michaels, so he played his role well.  Alot of people were expecting Bret to show, but I knew it wasn't going to happen.  However, when Michaels put Hogan in the Sharpshooter (and he was in it for a long time), the crowd went crazy.  In my section, the Hogan fans were on the edge of their seats not knowing if he was going to tap while the HBK fans (the full crowd was about 90% in favor of Hogan, but my section had about 20 HBK fans) waved their hands up and down yelling ""TAP! TAP! TAP!"" That was crazy.

Hogan bled like crazy.  I also loved HBK's reversal for the big Boot.  Hogan went to hit him with The Boot, but Michaels came off the ropes and nailed Hogan with a flyign forearm.  That looked sweet.

The match ended with HBK sneaking in a Chair shot while the referee was down.  He then hit the Top Rope Elbow drop, and then signaled for SWEET CHIN MUSIC (I was rooting for Hogan, but even I had to stand up and stomp my foot when Shawn set up for the Superkick) He hit it, but Hogan kicked out at 2! He HULKED UP! 3 Punches, The Big Boot, then The Legdrop and HOGAN WINS!

Awesome.  It was great to actually cheer the Hogan posedown after the match for once.  The only thing about the whole thing I didn't like was The Handshake.  I would have prefered to have Michaels stay heel as he was so good at it, but whatever.  AWESOME MATCH!

Rating - 10/10!!!

Overall, Summerslam had some downright awesome matches.  Hardy/Edge and Angle/Eugene were the only downers IMO, but Hogan/Michaels, the two world title matches, Taker/Orton, and The Ladder match were worth the price of admission.  This was truly an awesome show, and probably the best WWE PPV this year.

2311324,1,B0009PW3SI,"After the Draft, WWE went on a releasing spree. They didn't care if you liked the performer, they lost alot of good wrestlers. Summerslam came so they decided to ended some crappy gimmicks thats been going on like Orlando Jones losing his title and Eugene getting his ass kicked. I saw JBL-Batista at a live show, and it was an excellent match. They wrestled every house show it seems, so not really speical. Matt Hardy's return was a dud, and Micheals-Hogan was the only match worth watching. I don't know if the set is worth it just for one match, but thats your choice.",1126569600,3,572,4.509615384615385

Besides those matches three titles were on the line and a personal fued that sparked internet readers made a bloody debut.....

USA Championship

Orlando Jordon [Champion] vs. Chris Benoit:

Don't blink, or this match will be over. They have made way too many rematches with Orlando and Benoit, and amazingly this is the longest of the three matches they have had since Summerslam that lasted a mere 25 seconds!!! 2/10 At least Benoit won with the crossface.

Matt Hardy vs. Edge:

Look for their steel cage match to be bloody as well. Some hard hitting, legitimate punches in this one. Edge spears Matt through the ring ropes and then drops Hardy onto his face on a ring post and Hardy gets busted open. The crowd booed the hell out of the finish after the ref called for the bell when Matt couldn't stand up and defend himself. 5/10 [Crappy ending]

Ladder Match

Winner gets custody of Dominick

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio:

Great match, the best these two put on together. Rey powerbombs Eddie off the ladder, then Eddie jumps onto two ladders with Rey in the middle. Rey backdrops Eddie onto a ladder while standing on another one and falls in a horrifying moment.

One botched spot where Eddie tried to powerbomb Rey off a ladder but slipped, but thats easily forgettable in this match. Eddie's wife and Rey's son both make appearances in this match. Rey wins with the help of Eddie's wife. 9/10 [Great Match]

Kurt Angle vs. Eugene:

Just think of this match as an a**whoping as Angle beats the crap out of Eugene. This is the second time in two years that Eugene has been booed heavily at a Summerslam. Christy sure did look nice in that cheerleader outfit. 6/10 [Great pose by Angle at the end.]

Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker:

Not as good as their last match at WM21. They fight all over the ring and Randy spends too much time trying to hurt Taker's legs. A cool spot though when Randy and Taker try to give the other the tombstone piledriver. The ending comes when Randy's dad, disguised as a fan, runs into the ring and distracts Taker for Randy to lay out the RKO. 7/10

WWE Championship

John Cena [Champion] vs. Chris Jericho:

Awsome match, the buildup was great and the crowd helped a lot with their chants for Cena and Jericho all throughout the match. Both men worked hard and some great wrestling by both men. It was good that Eric Bischoff didn't interfere at all during the match. Watch the crowd boo the hell out of Cena when he gets out of the Walls of Jericho. Cena wins with the FU. 8.5/10 Great match but I was rooting for the loser.]

World Heavyweight Championship

No Holds Barred Match

Batista vs. JBL:

Biggest dissapointment of the night. Not even a trickle of blood as a chair, leather belt, and steel steps make appearances in the match. Thats it. Cool part when Batista spears JBl through the barrier from the crowd's side, but that was only one of two things great. The other was when Batista gave the Batista Bomb to JBL onto the steel steps for the win. 6/10 [Huge dissapointment]

Icon vs. Legend

Shawn Michales vs. Hulk Hogan:

Poor Shawn, from losing to Hogan to losing the Chris Masters challenge on Raw. He derserves wrestler of the year award or something to pay him his dues. Anyway, the match was good in some areas, HBK once again saved the match up. Hogan bled like a river was on his face and gets hit in the head with a steel chair but still kicks out.

The entire crowd thought Bret Hart was gonna show, but Hogan powers out and hits the legdrop for the win. 8.5/10

Summerslam is worth it for the Ladder Match, for the WWE Championship Match, for Kurt Angle's pose after his match, and even for the Hogan/HBK match. The perfect Item to rent though if you are still not 100% sure whether to buy it or not......",1126310400,8,4004,4.495856353591161

2.matt hardy vs. edge

This match was biult up so much on hype. i thought this would be a great match. turns out it wasn't because it was too damn short. it endedbecause hardy had lost too much blood. he hit his head on the pole. the ref called the match about 5 minutes after hardy getting cut open. so edge one cus of the match being stopped. it was way too short. other than that it was pretty good. best part is when edge speared hardy through the ropes. 3-5

match of the night. i really didn't care who won i like them both. soo many great bumps in the match and a good length. rey mysterio won after eddies wife interfered. man was eddie pissed after the match. good match. 5-5

4.kurt angle vs. eugene- no time limit for the gold medal

Good match. angle dominates pretty much 90% of the match. he pretty much kicked the sh*t outta eugene and i was glad. angle wins and gets his medal back after making eugene tap out. then angle had the ref put the medal around him like a ceremony. that was funny. 5-5

5.undertaker vs. randy orton

good match. it was basically just your typical match. undertaker was winning towards the end but at that part it looked like a fan was interfering. while that is happening orton takes advantage of the distraction to hit the rko on taker and orton got the pin and one. turns out that fan was ortons father dressed up and they walk up the walkway and pose. 4-5

evryone shouldve known who was going to win cus they were already advertising for cena vs. angle at unforgiven. anyway a pretty good match. slow at some parts but it was still good. jericho had cena in the walls of jericho but cena escapes and later hits the f-u for the win. ok match 4-5

7.batista vs. jbl-no holds barred match for the WHC

good match but again too much hype. it was too damn short. no blood. not many weapons. starts out with a brawl in the crowd. jbl is on the barricade and batista spears jbl through the barricade and it breaks. later after some brawling batista hits the batista bomb. i bet u thought he'd go for the pin. nope he takes jbl and power bombs him on the steel steps then pins him. that kicked ass best part of the match. thats what made this match good. 4-5

8. Shawn michaels vs. Hulk Hogan

me and my dad had a bet on this match. i took hbk and he took hogan. this was a good match. alot of brawling by michaels he just punches hogan so many times till he bleeds. they fight for a little longer and the ref goes down. well michaels takes a chair and levels hogan then when hogan gets up he hits sweet chim music covers him 1....2....no he kicked out. holy sh*t i didn't believe it. then hogan gets up hulks up on hbk. this part of the match was planned u could tell. cus when hogan hits the big boot michaels goes down then gets up and walks then falls in place for hogan to get the leg drop. hogan gets the leg drop and wins. after the match hbk gets up and shakes hogans hand. then hogan poses for the crowd and the show ended. this match lived up to the hype 5-5

this pay per view scored 34 out of 40 points. thats a very good score. its about a low A. So i would recommend this dvd greatly cus it was very good. much better than last years summerslam.",1126310400,,3516,4.209821428571429

2311330,4,B0009PW3SI,"Overall, this was a good PPV.

1) Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Jericho was easily the best match of the night and just shows what Shelton can offer the WWE over the next ten years or so. Jericho looked motivated for a change here and certainly helps this develop into match of the night - 9/10

2) Tag Team Turmoil - I'm not listing all the teams but this match was much better than I expected it being, due to the fact that they kept each fall down to a minimum ammount of time due to the crowd not really caring - 6.5/10

3) Chris Benoit vs Edge - This was the match that dissapointed me. I really thought with these two involved and with it being a last man standing match that we would have a **** quality match. Don't get me wrong this is still fairly good, just not up to the level Of Jericho/HHH's last man standing match - 7.5/10

4) Kane vs Viscera - lets face it who really wants to see Viscera on a PPV. Its bad enough having to watch him on Raw every week. But seriously this match was good for one thing, and that was giving Kane a much needed PPV victory. Admittedly Viscera crushing Trish after the match was an excellent visual and gave Trish the time off she needed to recover from her back injury - 5/10

5) HBK and Hogan vs Hassan and Daivari - make no mistake about it HBK did the carrying here. Just hearing Hogans pop when he makes his entrance is amazing, I still can't believe how loud it was. HBK worked his ass off in this one and to be fair so did Hassan and Daivari. Not to say Hogan put no effor in because he did, its just that he is limited in what he can do now because of his hip and knee injuries respectively - 7.5/10

6) HHH vs Batista - I enjoyed this match more than their mania match. I would give this ***.5 as opposed to their *** match at mania. HHH once again makes Batsita look like gold in this match. The angle revolving around the pedigree was worked nicely into the match and led to some intersetinf spots. A good main event - 8.5/10

To give this PPV ***** would be wrong because it is not that good, but apart from the Kane/Viscera match all the matches are watchable and provide good entertainment. Overall I would give Backlash 8/10",1125532800,,2181,4.166270783847981

4: GOLD MEDAL MATCH - Kurt Angle Vs Eugene - 9/10:

I'm glad Kurt won the Medal back

5: The Undertaker Vs Randy Orton - 9/10:

Why the hell does Orton always consider himself as Legend Killer? If he wants to earn that name, ask Triple H or Undertaker for a HELL IN A CELL MATCH. If he wins, i'll probably believe that.

He won the match by cheating

Undertaker is always the legendary phenom

6: WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - Chris Jericho Vs John Cena - 9/10

John Cena should change his styles and wears wrestling outfits and also bring back the traditional WWE belt, maybe he'll be a great champion. Don't be a disgraced champ Cena

The old WWE belt looks much better than this bling bling belt!!

I'm glad Orlando Jordan and Chris Benoit don't wear John Cena's bling bling belt (Oh i forgot, JBL burned it)

Hopefully Kurt Angle will be the new WWE champ at Unforgiven. I have wanted him to be the champ again for a real long time.

Tag Team Turmoil

This was filler.  No more, no less.

Last Man Standing

Chris Benoit vs. Edge

In the history of this match this ranks right at the top.  These are hard to pull off because the finish is normally so anti-climactic.  Not so here.  Very physical and almost brutal match with some nifty spots using a ladder.

Kane vs. Viscera

On paper this looks like crap.  Guess what?  It's not bad at all.  It's slightly above mediocre but this could've been a total diaster.  It's watchable.

Shawn Michaels & Hulk Hogan vs. Muhammad Hassan & Daivari

The match everyone paid to see.  It's very entertaining and Hogan's weaknessess are hard to exploit in this type of match.  Doesn't dissappoint.

United States Championship

Orlando Jordan vs. Chris Benoit

A squash, but a well earned one for Benoit. He really deserves more but now the US title will build credibility again.

Edge vs. Matt Hardy

So much build up, so much intensity, so much drama.  A spear from the apron to the floor...only to have a bogus finish with the ref stopping the match!  Any hopes the WWE had of making more money on this may have been dashed.  We didn't need a clean winner just a defined one.

Ladder Match for the Custody of Dominick

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

This fued will never get old.  What an amazing match with some breathtaking spots and expected but welcome interference from Dominick.  I'm not sure if it's over but it looks that way.

Kurt Angle vs. Eugene

WWE made the right call by making Angle almost evil in this match.  He's just vicious and cruel.  The crowd was hot for him too.  Eugene's offense was minimal.  He served that same purpose here that he did for Triple H last year.  Good match.

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Much slower than the WM21 match.  This is more methodical with too many rest holds.  The pace picks up half way and the ending was a bit bizarre but I liked it.

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho

Well, so long Y2J.  He will be missed.  He certainly left on a high note.  Awesome match.  Never a dull moment and lots of counters and chain wrestling.  Jericho carried Cena to one of his best ever.  The crowd reactions made it feel like a huge event.  Half cheering Cena and half Y2J.  Incredible!

No Holds Barred for the World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. JBL

DC was psyched for the Animal!  I like big men brawls.  What you see is what you get.  What we got was one hell of a good brawl.  They could've used more weapons and it needed blood but they didn't beat around the bush.  Solid match and the Batista bomb on the steps was brutal!

Legend vs. Icon

Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels

It lived up to the hype but HBK should've won.  I love Hogan from my days as a kid but HBK is the better athlete and in ring performer.  Every promo he had before this was all true.  Be that as it may this match was what made me buy the PPV anyway! I wasn't disappointed.  Lots of action and Hogan's bleeding was cool.  Say what you want about both men.

8. Hogan vs Michaels- The other Match Of the Night. Hogan and Michaels both performed well. The ending wasn't that good though. Michaels should have won.

 Great ppv better than Mania. Tied with PPV of the Year with Vengeance. I think Raw owned the night as they should have Raw is way better than Smackdown! I am going to list the main superstars of Raw and Smackdown and then you decide

 Raw- HBK, HHH, Edge, Cena, Angle, Kane and the Immortal Hulk Hogan

 Smackdown- Batista, JBL, Mysterio, Guerrero, Benoit, Taker, and Orton

Raw has all the legends Flair, Rock, Mick Foley, Stone Cold, and Hogan. How can Orton be the legend killer if there are no legends on Smackdown besides Taker?

Compare Vengeance to Great American Bash and you will know that Raw is better

2311336,5,B0009PW3SI,"Oh man has the WWE product sucked lately? The new creative team sucks nuts, and the fans seem to bring out their horrible booking by cheering heels and booing faces! At least they were able to turn things around for the time being with this amazing PPV called SUMMERSLAM! It only had a few hick ups and was overall a great show!

Match #1 Chris Benoit vs. Orlando Jordan (c) for the United States Championship: Why does everyone rate this match so low??? You know it delivered everything you wanted to see so why rate it like crap? I give this a 1000000/10 because Benoit made Jordan TAP OUT (in 25 seconds)!!! And like I said above in the intro...it's not Jordan's fault he was a sucky champ, it was the creative team's fault! Benoit will definitely bring prestige back to that title if the CT doesn't jack it up!

Match #2 Matt Hardy vs. Edge: This was awful! The worst match of the night for several reasons. First of all they made Hardy look like a piece of crap! And second of all, it was way way too short! With this and what happened on RAW the next night, I hope Hardy gets the nod at Unforgiven! With the way things are playing out this has to be FAR from over. Edge wins due to ref stoppage, BOO! 1/10

Match #3 Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guererro in a ladder match for the Custody of Dominic: This was AMAZING! Match of the night for sure!!! The spots were SICK and you just have to see it to see how great this was!!! Dominic and Eddie's wife interfere costing Eddie the match and allowing Rey to pick up yet another win over Eddie...oh yeah and also getting Dominic...10/10!

Match #4 Kurt Angle vs. Eugene no time limit for the gold medal: Kurt wins! It's true, oh it's DAMN TRUE! Decent match with good wrestling, but way too short also bringing down the score here. Eugene taps out! 7/10

Match #5 Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker in a Wrestlemania Rematch: Not as good as there mania match (which I loved), but a good contest nonetheless. Bob orton interferes yet again allowing Orton to finally hit the RKO on Taker for the win! 8/10

Match #6 John Cena (c) vs. Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship: We all knew Jericho had no chance of winning here. Despite that, he put on an awesome performance as usual! The crowd was nuts here 50% for Jericho and 50% for Cena...guess it goes to show how fickle most of the fans are and that it was only a mater of time before people realized that Cena sucks as champ! Great little spot to end the match with Cena twisting Jericho around his body into the FU! 8/10 Their ""You're Fired!"" match on RAW the next night was better, and was probably the most clever thing the CT has come up with in a long time...it was a great way to send Jericho on his way, LOL!

Match #7 Batista (c) vs. JBL in a No Holds Barred match for the World Heavyweight Championship: What made this one better then the last match was that it wasn't as predictable. You figured Batista would win, but then there still was a chance JBL would take it here. Yes it was short, but a perfect length considering how much their last match sucked!!! No blood which was the only downer. Batista finishes off JBL with two Batista Bombs, one of them being on the steel steps AWESOME!!! 9/10

Match #8 Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan: Great match and a great choice for the main event!!! Hogan bled like crazy!!! HBK definitely carried this one cuz Hogan just can't cut it anymore! I have to bring the score down a 1/2 a point only cuz the wrong man won...and HBK is a face again! DAMMIT! Hogan gets the leg drop after getting his ass kicked! 9.5/10

This show opened up for many great storylines in the future. Kurt Angle is going to be the new #1 contender to Cena and rumor has it that Eddie Guererro will be the next to face Batista, which is fine by me! I was disappointed to not see Shelton Benjamin, Booker T, Big Show, Kane, and especially Christian on the card, but what can ya do right? This was great show and I fully plan on buying the DVD!

Main Event: Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan

I am pretty sick of the same thing happening on Raw every week. Either someone's getting beat up & Hulk comes in & saves him or one of them is in a match and the other screws him to a DQ. But you have to admit, Shawn's promo about screwing Hulk made me think about how fake this is. Original plan was for Kevin Nash to screw Hogan to make HBK win, but they changed it. Both men had a special entrance and a great match. Hogan wins and the two shake hands. Match review: 8/10

Orlando Jordan (c) vs Chris Benoit

Tough to rate because the match only lasted 24 seconds. Benoit makes Jordan tap to the crossface. 3/10

Matt Hardy vs Edge

Another short match because edge busts hardy open with the steel post and the match had to be stopped. Edge is the winner. 6/10

Ladder Match for the custody of Dominick

Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio

Great match. Amazing when Eddie PowerBombed rey of the ladder. Rey wins and gains custody of dominick. 9/10

Eugene Invitational

Eugene Dinsmore vs Kurt Angle

Nothing cheered me up here. Angle makes Eugene tap with an Ankle Lock. 6/10

Randy Orton vs Undertaker 2

Undertaker got damn robbed because of Bob Orton jr came in the ring dressed as an old man. Taker pushed him into the corner and Orton hit the RKO to win. 8/10

WWE title

John Cena (c) vs Chris Jericho

good match with some good spots. Cena wins with the F-U.8/10

World heavyweight championship No Holds Barred

Batista(c) vs JBL

JBL should have been hurt when he got speared through the barricade.steps leather belt world title belt were all used. Batista wins with a powerbomb on to the steps. 8/10

Main Event Legend vs Icon

HBK vs Hulk hogan

Oh my, blood spilt everywhere in this contest. Great entrance by hogan with the massive american flag and it was a great match. Hogan wins with a legdrop. After the match,both superstars shake hands. 10/10

2311349,4,B0009PW3SI,"First off, why is it people choose to use the review forums as a message board?

I'm going to go through this with a match by match coverage and give my overall score for the night.

Chris Benoit def. Orlando Jordan (C) for the United States Championship. Why so short? It was over in less than thirty seconds. That's completely ridiculous. Orlando must have gotten injured before the show with a match that short.

Edge def. Matt Hardy when the ref stopped the match. It was a brawl as expected. Edge winning, but not actually winning allows for a continuation of the feud. Well played by the WWE. I still don't get what they're doing with Kane in all of this. They pretty much killed his career.

Rey Misterio def. Eddie Guerrero for custody of Dominick. The stupid stipulation made this one predictable. The ladder match was full of action and definitely my pick for match of the night.

Kurt Angle def. Eugene to win back his gold medal. Another predictable match that was over relatively quickly that was full of Eugene's humorous copying of wrestlers and Angle winning his medal back.

Vince McMahon for President? Sure! Only if he's running Republican!

Randy Orton def. The Undertaker. Undertaker's entrance took too long usual. This was probably the least predictable match of the night. It was for the most part a back and forth brawl coupled with each others' signature moves. Orton won with the RKO after interference by Orton's father, possibly setting up for a match between the two.

John Cena def. Y2J to retain the WWE championship. Predictable match if you have seen Y2J's post-Summerslam schedule still was a good match. It was very good despite all of the hype surrounding it and the crowd was really into it.

Batista def. JBL in a No Holds Barred match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. I wasn't expecting much real wrestling and a lot of blood. I didn't see Batista losing at home and with his history of winning his opponents specialty matches. Full of brawls, no blood and in the end Batista won with a Batista bomb on the steel stairs, reminiscent of his hell in a cell match with HHH two months prior.

Hulk Hogan def. HBK Shawn Michaels. First off, it's pitiful that this match took precedence over a title match. I expected Hogan to win just because he is Hogan and he will use the same boring moves. HBK out to more cheers than jeers. Ever notice how Lilian likes to check out the wrestler's butts? Hogan came down to a huge ovation, and I could have only hoped that the match was shorter than his introduction.
Hulk, we know you're bald, could you just take off the bandana already? Hogan does his dumb Hulk thing and gets blocked. Spanish announce table is destroyed as usual. It's never one of the regular announcers' tables. What does the WWE have against them? Wow, Hogan bladed? I'm shocked. Two refs later and after all of HBK's moves, we get to see Hulk mode. As guessed, Hogan would win. They ended with a handshake, allowing for HBK's return as a face.

Overall good show despite some poor booking ideas. The wrestler's pulled it off and put on a great show. 3.5/5",1124582400,,3116,4.6268115942028984

United States Championship Chris Benoit defeated Orlando Jordan to win the United States Championship - This was the shortest match on the card and possibly in history. This was just Jordan giving a punch, Benoit got fired up and German Suplexs him, and then gets him in the Crossface and Jordan taps. Match Rating 3

Edge defeated Matt Hardy- This match was not a wrestling match by any means just like JR said on Raw. This was so intense that Edge speared Hardy through the ropes which was incredible. Edge beat Matt senseless. I thought this match was going to be a good length in time but, it was not. The rematch will most likely be at Unforgiven. I would like to see that one go longer. The match ended when Edge beat Matt Hardy to were he couldn't defend himself so the refree stop the match. He was bleeding so badly. Match Rating 5

Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guererreo in a ladder match for the custody of Dominick- This was a match that would tie match of the night. There were some botched manuevers here but, they were intense. There were so unique offense from both men. Rey Mysterio should defenietly be in another ladder match. He and Eddie are great together. This will probably be the final encounter between these two because they have had 7 matches together and Eddie has lost all of them. Eddie's wife came out and pushed the ladder from underneath him and gave Rey the advantage that he needed to win. Match Rating 9

Kurt Angle Defeated Eugene in a No time limit match to win his gold medals- These two can work. I really liked this match. Eugene is already getting his first boo's. Wwe uses him as a heel in house shows. I think he would be better off as a face. Eugene did the Rock bottom and the Stunner on Kurt. Angle did his basic offense with the Germans and the back suplexs. He Angle slammed him then applied the Angle lock and Eugene tapped. Then Kurt got a chair and stood on it and renacted the gold medal ceremony by having the refree put the gold medal around his neck. Match Rating 7

Randy Orton defeated Undertaker- This was a better version of the WrestleMania 21 match. This one was actually more entertaining. Undertaker is dominating early on. He hits most of his normal moves like old school and snake eyes. Randy is getting better with his restholds. Undertaker then hits the chokeslam. Then Cowboy Bob Orton comes out dressed up as someone else, he distracts the refree and the Undertaker then Randy hits the RKO. 1-2-3. Then at the end of the match he takes off his dads mask and they both do his pose back to back. Match Rating 9

John Cena defeated Chris Jericho to retain the Wwe title- This match had great build up and it did deliver. This two have great chemistry together. I hate people who post spoilers on Amazon.com. They ruined the entire match for me. Jericho had John Cena in the Walls of Jericho and it looked like Cena was going to tap but, he held on. Then Cena looked like he was going to F-U him from the top but, Jericho reversed. Then Cena got him up on his shoulders and connected with the F-U. Match Rating 8

Batista defeated JBL in a NO HOLDS BARRED Match to reatin the World HeavyWeight Championship- This match was way overhyped for the length. This was not a long match at all. There were good spots for the amount of time it lasted. JBL got plowed through the barracade by Batista. Then JBL hit the clothesline from hell. Batista kicked out. Then JBL got the stairs in the ring and tried to powerbomb or something like that but, Batista back dropped him. Then he hit the Batista bomb. He didn't cover him though. He picked him up then did the Batista bomb on the steel step that was in the ring. Match Rating 7.5

Legend vs Icon Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Micheals- This match, Orton vs Taker and the ladder match were all tied for match of the night. I really like this one. The hype was huge and it did indeed deliver. This match was great. Micheals was getting frustrated at the beginning moments of the match because Hogan was more powerful. I really like the concept that they knocked over two refrees. It really made me get on the edge of my seat. I thought Bret was going to come in when Micheals had the SharpShooter on Hogan. Micheals hit the superkick on Hogan but, the refree was down. Then the refree got back up, the adrenaline started to flow through Hogan then he hit him with the boot and the leg drop. Match Rating 9

Legend vs. Icon
Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels
I don't expect this to be a great match due to Hogan's lack of great wrestling. However I don't expect this match to bomb either because of two reasons...1. Shawn Michaels can usually carry anyone to a good match. 2. The crowd should be hot during this match which may add some excitement (ex. WrestleMania X-8 Hogan vs. The Rock) As for a winner; I would have to say Shawn Michaels. Bret Hart will make his long overdue return and throw a chair at Hogan which Hogan will catch then BAM! Sweet Chin Music! Michaels wins with Bret hart smiling over Hogan. What a shocking ending that would be. This will probably be the match that will transcend Michaels from Icon to Legend status and what better way to put him over than for him to go over the greatest Legend of all, Hulk Hogan. Match Rating 9/10 Time 15 mins

World Heavyweight Championship
No Holds Barred
Batista vs. JBL
OMG did their match at The Great American Bash suck! I'm not expecting this match to bomb though because JBL does very good in gimmick matches and Batista has shown that he can pull of a great weapons match (ex. Vengeance vs. Triple-H) I think this match will be absolutely brutal to make up for their disappointment at The Great American Bash (Such a disappointment that even Vince McMahon wasn't happy about the match) I'm going to have to go with Batista for this match. He will win this match in his hometown and go onto No Mercy to face Randy Orton for the title and lose thanks to a returning Brock Lesnar. Match Rating 9/10 Time 23 mins

WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Chris Jericho
This match defiantly has a lot going for it. The feud has been pretty good and the build up has been tremendously long which has added a lot to this match. The hype for this match has been so strong that even I am looking forward to this match despite the fact that Cena isn't the greatest wrestler. I think that Jericho will defiantly be able to carry Cena to a good match. My only concern is the amount of time that may be given to this match considering that there are a lot of matches tonight that need a good amount of time to make them great. Hopefully time will not be a concern and this match will go on for about 18 minutes. As for a winner I am defiantly going to pick Cena. Even though I believe that Jericho defiantly deserves it more than Cena Jericho is taking a small absence from WWE after SummerSlam to work with his band Fozzy and promotional posters have been saying that Cena will face Kurt Angle at Unforgiven for the title. Sorry Jericho, maybe next time. Match rating 8/10 Time 18 mins

Legend vs. Legend Killer 2
The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton
Their match at WrestleMania was defiantly a very solid, good match that saw the right man go over. This time though it will be Randy Orton's chance to shine as he will probably defeat The Undertaker at SummerSlam giving him enough momentum to go after Batista at No Mercy for the title. Orton will win the title and The Undertaker will challenge him to a gimmick match at Survivor Series which will end this feud. I expect this match to be very much like their match at WrestleMania with a few changes here and there. I also hope to see another Chokeslam counter into the RKO again or maybe even a Last Ride counter into the RKO. Should be a good match. Match Rating 9/10 Time 21 mins

Matt Hardy vs. Edge
Well it is about danm time we get to see this match. It has been building ever since Matt got let go (Bad move WWE) Well, now that Matt is back there is no stopping him from completely destroying Edge. I don't know what to expect from this match because given the storyline there will probably not be any high flying moves in this match. Because Smackdown has a weapons match between Batista and JBL this match probably won't be No DQ. So what is the only explanation for this match? This match will be the shortest match of the night as it will start with Matt Hardy running to the ring clotheslining edge over the top rope then smacking him in the head with a chair. Bell rings. Edge loses but doesn't look bad in the process and Matt Hardy looks good because he does what we have been waiting for him to do...destroy Edge. Matt Hardy's attack will probably not stop there though as the fight will probably continue backstage where Matt Hardy will finish Edge off with a not very believable stunt such as throwing him off of a ledge into a dumpster or something like that. Match Rating 6/10...Aftermath 9/10 Time 2 mins

Ladder Match For Custody Of Dominique
Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guererro
This feud has gone on long enough and now it is time to finally end it. This match will no doubt in my mind steal the show with high flying maneuvers off of the ladder, great wrestling, and some sick bumps taken by both men. As for a winner I will go with Rey Mysterio because if Eddie wins then that means that this feud will drag on even longer and I don't think that these two men can afford to keep on doing this as it seems to be making some fans angry already. Rey Wins. Gains custody of Dominique. Happy Ending. The Keyword ""Ending"". Match Rating 10/10 Time 23 mins

Orlando Jordan is the worst United States Champion of all time! He has no charisma and has done nothing to bring this belt credibility! Now that I got that off of my chest...it's a danm shame that this match couldn't have been a fatal fourway match involving Christian and Booker T. That match would've kicked ass! But no! Were stuck with a Great American Bash rematch that will probably be the same exact match with only one change....Benoit will win the title. Match Rating 8/10 Time 17 mins

Eugene Invitational
No Time Limit, One Fall to A Finish
Eugene vs. Kurt Angle
While the psychology and chemistry between the two may be strong I still feel this match will fail to deliver and will just be a total Kurt Angle match with Eugene getting a couple of lucky moves in here and there. Kurt will defiantly win this match and get his medals back because he needs the momentum heading into his title match with Cena at Unforgiven. Match Rating 7/10 Time 9 mins

SummerSlam has a very good card with many possibilities (Hart Returning). This show I think will be even better than WrestleMania if all the matches are given the right amount of time. SummerSlam has all the tools to make it an amazing show. The match time count is 2 hrs and 9 minutes. If Vince plans to make this a 2 hrs and 30 minutes show then that seems like a reasonable amount of time considering if there are any boring segments (Trish Stratus confronting Ashley) or backstage interviews and also the flashback videos. All in all I'm expecting SummerSlam to be an overall amazing show defiantly worth my money. We'll just have to wait and see...",1124150400,,6848,4.428571428571429

I am a huge Undertaker fan, but I think that the series will be tied at 1-1 like angle and HBK.

Prediction: Cena

Jericho has never defeated Cena, you can check yourself.  Probably a rematch at Unforgiven.

He better win against JBL.  He has beaten HHH in a Hell in a Cell match.  I JBL wins, the WWE is saying that JBL is better then HHH.

Hogan vs. Michales

Prediction: HBK

I am sorry, but the only reason Hogan is doing this is to promote his show.  So I hope HBK wins.

SUCK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jbl vs. Big Dave. 8/10. well, GAB sucked, but im sure if you put in a stipulation this match will be good. if JBl can pull a good match outa the big show, he can with batista. im guessing jbl wins.

HHH vs. flair. At unforgiven, not Summerslam, this match needs more bulid up that 3 weeks.

eddie vs ray. keep this fued going. all there matches are awesom

kur vs eugene. how dose the 2ed best wrestler alive today(behind HBK) get stuck with eugene? thats an outrage. that retard should go back to the blue bus and stop acting like a wrestler. hopefully kurt breaks eugenes neck.

summerslam will be awesom providing Y2J and jbl win. and hogan/hbk dosnt suck. im deffentily going to suggest ordering this ppv. should be great. if its anything like vengeance 2005.",1123027200,,1366,4.524390243902439

 the match wasn't that great but i always love the tag team action nice move by HURRICANE and rosey regal and tajiri first eliminate the heart throbs and dean and maven the la resistance eliminated regal and tajiri next out is hurricane and rosey. hurricane jumps of roseys shoulders onto conway for the 3 count

Intercontinental Championship

Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Jericho 9/10- a great kickoff to the ppv . these 2 can put on a show. Benjamin should be getting main event title matches as well as Jericho. several false finishes & high risk moves.

World Tag Team Championship

Tag Team Turmoil

William Regal & Tajiri vs Hurricane & Rosey vs La Resistance vs Simon Dean & Maven vs Heart Throbs 8/10- a much better match than i anticipated. fast paced with several surprises including a shocking ending!

Last Man Standing

Edge vs Chris Benoit 8.5/10- this match was good, but could have been better. slow pace at the beginning hurts it. it picks up as the match progresses. Benoit deserves better than this.

Jerry Lawler interviews the Raw Divas in the ring. a what waste of time!

great interaction between Trish Stratus & Viscera outside her dressing room.

Viscera(w/Trish Stratus) vs Kane(w/Lita) 8/10- a better match than it looks to be on paper. If Viscera wins, he gets a night with Trish. Kane as the liitle guy in the match? he surprises as he moves rather quick. Viscera is too slow but he still puts on a good show. the surprise match of the night thanks to Trish & Lita.

Muhammad Hassan & Daivari vs Hulk Hogan & Shawn Michaels 7.5/10- the crowd was really into this one.unfortunately, the action was only ordinary. Hassan & Daivari's ring skills are lacking. Hogan at 52 is better than these 2 clowns & he hasn't had a match in 2 years. i wish Hogan & Michaels had teamed up 10 years ago when they were younger. seeing them together is still a sight.

Christian cuts a good interview in the ring.

World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs Triple H(w/Ric Flair) 8.5/10- their match at Wrestlemania was better. HHH looks ragged in the ring. Batista gives out of gas easily. Trips is not good at carrying a match. the last 5 minutes and Ric Flair save this match.

the extras are good on this one including Trish & Viscera's date as well as a great interview with Hulk & Shawn. Lita & Edge meet backstage. a must see.

overall, Backlash was lacking in excitement. in all fairness to Backlash, it is hard to follow Wrestlemania up every year with a great ppv. most of the wrestlers looked tired & burned out. a watchable ppv but nothing rememberable other than the Hulkster & HBK together.",1120953600,,2526,4.604910714285714
2311379,3,B0009PW3SI,"KEY:

91 - 100 - Perfect. A flawless PPV, you must buy this. Without a doubt this belongs in everyone's wrestling collection.

81 - 90 - Superb. An outstanding PPV, I highly recommend that you buy this.

71 - 80 - Great. A first-rate PPV, certainly worth your money.

61 - 70 - Good. A satisfying PPV. Perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it.

51 - 60 - Fair. An average PPV. It is worth a look, not your money.

41 - 50 - Mediocre. A dull PPV. - Perhaps take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though.

31 - 40 - Poor. An unsatisfactory PPV - Maybe for hardcore wrestling fans, not for anyone else.

21 - 30 - Bad. A lousy PPV - This is not worth a look from anyone.

11 - 20 - Terrible. An awful PPV - Stay away from this and make sure you never see it.

1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time.

BACKLASH 2005:

Shelton Benjamin VS Chris Jericho: 8.5/10

This surprised me. A very good match and a brilliant opener. Some great moves are performed and this is a very exciting match. Best match of the night.

William Regal & Tajiri vs. Heart Throbs vs. La Resistance vs. Simon Dean & Maven vs. The Hurricane & Rosey: 6/10

Average tag team action. Each team is however eliminated very fast and this ruins the match.

Last Man Standing Match

Edge vs. Chris Benoit: 7.5/10

Not a bad match. not very hardcore and brutal but there are some brilliant spots such as a german suplex off of the ladder. The ending was stupid. not a bad match overall.

Kane vs. Viscera: 4/10

Typical boring match between two big men. Not many wrestling moves as you can imagine. A short match thank god.

Hulk Hogan & Shawn Michaels vs. Muhammad Hassan & Khosrow Daivari: 6/10

Yes, Hulk Hogan returning for one more match was great but let's be realistic. This match was not good. The crowd were really into it because it was Hogan but if you look past that, it was just a typical match. Nothing special.

WWE World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. Triple H: 8/10

Surprisingly, not a bad match. A much more entertaining match then their encounter at Wrestlemania. I enjoyed this match and I felt that their wrestlemania match should have been more like this. All the moments leading up to the finish were great.

SCORE: 39.5/60 (66/100)

According to the key, I have rated Backlash as 'Good', a satisfying PPV and perhaps you should buy this if you really feel you want it. I agree with this. This is not a terrible PPV but once again it is nothing amazing, nothing special. Buy it if you really feel you must see it. Otherwise don't bother.",1120176000,,2584,4.274226804123711
