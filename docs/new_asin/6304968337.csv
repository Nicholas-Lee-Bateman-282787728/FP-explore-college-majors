The so-called master in this video has spent too much time in the dojang and has no idea of what would work in the street.  His movements are stiff and predictable.  He demonstrates against people doing stiff TKD attacks, not against anything like what one would really encounter.  When he punches, his elbow flops out to the side which both robs you of power and steals the nice crisp look which many TKD people admire.  I get the impression, however, that he may have some idea of what to do in the street, but not using the techniques he demonstrates here.  Unfortunately, this is an all too common trait in the TKD community - ""I'll show it to you this way, but do it another way if you want it to work"".  I'm quite surprised that Paladin puts this out, since they have a reputation of producing high quality, functional material.  This is not one of them.",1059868800,3,955,4.386363636363637
8108904,1,6304968337,"Bear in mind there are two mainstream applications of Tae Kwon Do, WTF and UTF (World & Universal Tae Kwon Do Federation). This video shows the forms of WTF only!  Don't buy the video for its combat applications only  because they are very short and they are really obvious. Furthermore it's a  pitty they don't mention the Korean names of the stances/kicks/punches. The  video lasts about 45 minutes.",954028800,47,401,4.852941176470588
