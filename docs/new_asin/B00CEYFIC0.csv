5720944,5,B00CEYFIC0,"First things first!  Though this Bluray Disc is being promoted as 3D, you do not need a 3D TV to watch it. Upon inserting the BD in your standard BD player an image appears on the screen that asks if you want 3D or 2D. I don't have a 3D player (and see no reason to get one) but enjoyed this set.

I used the word ""set"" in previous paragraph because there are two discs in the package and - between the two there are THREE different programs with a total running time of nearly 3  hours! Certainly great value.

Over the last 10 years or so, I've reviewed many of the ""Live at Montreux"" DVDs released by Eagle Vision. Though the festival from whose archives the performances come is officially the Montreux Jazz Festival - the music styles are all over the spectrum with many rock and pop performers included. The 85 minute film, ""Experience Montreux"", that fills Disc One, and was the last film produced by MJF founder Claude Nobbs reflects this variety. There are major names like Elvis Costello and Herbie Hanconk, world music artists new to me (from Brazil and Poland,) and emerging indie-folk artists like Mumford & Sons (before their breakthrough) all recorded at the 2010 MJF. Yes, there is rock (Massive Attack) and rap (NAS and Damian Marley). So, you do need an open mind to music styles when watching this. (I have one so I enjoyed it). Between the performances are a few short interviews with the performers (about how important the MJF is) and some great stories from Nobbs (who died in December 2012) just before two of the three films here won awards at the 3D Film Awards.

The second Disc includes two concerts which are definitely jazz. First is one by Quincy Jones (as leader) and the Global Gumbo All Stars, with Herbie Hancock (who played more MJFs than any artist) as a guest on one number. (Note that a performance of HH with QJ and the GGAS is on Disc One also). Then there is a concert by Hancock and his band performing songs from his ""Imagine Project"" performing songs by Joni Mitchell, Bob Marley and John Lennon plus his hit composition ""Watermelon Man"". In fact, that song appears THREE times between the two discs.

The Blu-ray image is sharp and the sound wonderful. I'm not sure how much the #D will add to the enjoyment - except for the scenes of the beauty of Montreaux in the ""travelogue"" section on the first disc. But, if you are a lover of Jazz, and have a BD player, I can certainly recommend this set.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8581112,4,B00CEYFIC0,"Decent concert but only for the opened minded individuals who can appreciate various genres of music, could have been better if the live hip hop group was Mos Def featuring Robert Glasper or The Roots, the live performance from Nas was not great and had the wrong crowd in my opinion. One Bluray disc includes the jazz of Herbie Hancock featuring Quincy Jones. Both disc sound good on my basic equipment.",1499472000,,404,4.704225352112676

8581119,5,B00CEYFIC0,"Appropriately titled Experience Montreux here is an eclectic collection of artists brought together by Quincy Jones and Claude Nobs (founder of the annual Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland) to give the audience a taste of what the festival has been all about over the years. What we find on the two disks here is not strictly jazz according to Louis Armstrong. This is an evening of music and some of the same performances and interviews are repeated on both disks.

The evening (disk 1) opens with two pop music performances, followed by Angelique Kidjos spirited rendition of the late Miriam Makebas Saduva and twelve more songs by various rock and roll artists (including Damian Marley, Elvis Costello and guitarist Joe Bonamassa).

Disk two opens with West Africans Richard Bona of Cameroon and Lionel Loueke of Benin. Others who follow include Paulinho Da Costa of Brazil and Jeff Becks young Australian bassist Tal Wilkenfeld. It closes with Herbie Hancock (and the Imagine Project) executing his popular song Watermelon Man and nine more songs interspersed with interviews. Hancock and Loueke outdo each other with virtuoso performances on an extended version of Watermelon Man. Scenic views introduce us to the town of Montreux and its waters.

Great, standard jazz is available on thousands of compact disks for purchase. What we have here is what you pay to go see once in a while at a live concert. It is delicious and entertaining.  Audio/video quality of the recording on blue-ray disk is as expected- very good (although the audio is not exactly even of both disks).",1393113600,3,1584,5.034351145038168
8581120,4,B00CEYFIC0,"Overall this is a great blu ray show/concert but while none of my other blu ray concerts/shows ever sound too ""hot"" or a little too sharp in the treble, this disc walks a very fine line sometimes getting just a bit too bright at times. That's unfortunate because the music is just great. Otherwise this disc is a treat.",1387670400,,319,4.423728813559322
8581121,5,B00CEYFIC0,"This Blu-Ray collection on one disc offers you fantastic performances of Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock and on the second disc live performances by Mumford & Sons, Elvis Costello, etc.
And to my surprise, they can be played in 2D and 3D.
A great value!",1377561600,6,253,4.644444444444445
