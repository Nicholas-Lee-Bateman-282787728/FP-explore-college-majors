6031500,5,B00FUABH1G,"I had this movie on VHS and have waited what has seemed forever to get it on DVD.  It is the ultimate in visual escape from life. Having gone to many of the Club Med resorts, it holds a special meaning for me, but I do recommend it for anyone! Great scenery, great love story!",1402444800,,276,4.0181818181818185
6031501,5,B00FUABH1G,"If you like a good romantic movie, this one's for you! I have been looking for this film for over 20 years!!",1400198400,,108,3.9545454545454546
6031502,4,B00FUABH1G,"Back in the mid-'80s when this TV movie was made, the Club Med resorts primarily attracted singles, some looking to find romance and others to just have a good time.  This frothy little TV movie was authentically filmed at the Club Med Ixtapa Mexico, with its beautiful stucco buildings, huge aqua swimming pool, sandy crescent-shaped beach and individual tiled roof guest apartments (I visited a Mexican Club Med called Playa Blanca back in the '80s that is now closed, which had a very similar design layout, as did many of them then).  Handsome Jack Scalia plays the village chief/manager G.O. (employee), and Linda Hamilton of Terminator fame is one of the G.M.'s (guests) who happens to be Scalia's ex-girlfriend, and they reignite their former romance.  Comedian Sinbad plays the entertainment director, and Bill Maher the cable TV host/comedian is a wisecracking bartender.  A highlight is performance footage of young Gloria Estefan with Miami Sound Machine doing many of their hit songs, including the lively Conga and Bad Boy which help recreate the nightlife entertainment of clubs, bars & shows found at the Club Med resorts.  This is a pleasant movie which is appealing both as a romance and travelogue, with a bit of nostalgia for those of us former Club Med G.M.'s who fondly recall the Hands Up-Give Me Your Heart song by Ottawan (featured here) and the upbeat carefree vibe that Club Med created in our youth.",1386806400,2,1426,4.974789915966387
8618647,3,B00FUABH1G,"I was enjoying my vacation at Club Med back in 1985 when a movie crew suddenly descended upon us.  Though they promised it'd be fun to have a movie crew around, they were (as expected) in the way all the time.  No one had heard of any of the actors in the movie except Patrick MacNee.  At first clubbers wanted to be in the crowd scenes, but then fewer and fewer people would show up as they realized how boring it can be.  The crew started giving away t-shirts but after a few days they were giving out booze (as I recall) as an incentive to stick around.  I'm in a couple of the scenes.  As everyone has commented, it's a terribly cheesy movie... but the surroundings are nice.  No surprises in the story. P.S.  It wasn't on an island, as it implies.  A few years later I went back and during the bus ride a fellow traveler kept telling us that the place was an island and he knew all about it because he'd seen this tv movie.  I told him it wasn't.  He insisted... until our bus pulled up to the front of the building.",1527638400,,1021,4.131979695431472

8618651,4,B00FUABH1G,"As made for TV movies go, this one is above average. Great early scenes with Sinbad, Bill Maher and fabulous performances on film by Miami Sound Machine at their peak from the Primitive Love album.  Good time capsule.",1453680000,,217,4.7105263157894735

8618653,3,B00FUABH1G,"I never saw this movie before. I received it the other day. I watched it today and didn't think very much of this movie. It was just ok movie,nothing more. Bought it because of Linda Hamilton. She is much better in  the T. V. series Beauty and The Beast and the Terminator movies(1&2). Not that good in this movie.",1440979200,,314,4.322033898305085
