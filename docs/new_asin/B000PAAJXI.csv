8190070,3,B000PAAJXI,A little stiff. I prefer Kanazawa's videos. But this one is interesting nonetheless and it brings a fresh perspective on these katas.,1407888000,2,133,5.090909090909091
8190071,2,B000PAAJXI,"Don't waste your time with this video.  This guy thinks he's doing.  He's not.  His stance is bad, his form is sloppy, it does not look like Shotokan to me.",1397347200,,156,4.133333333333334
8190072,3,B000PAAJXI,"I'm not going to be overly critical about this video as it has it's place. As a black belt of many years and one that has stopped training for a few years, I can see a place for this video. If you are a student unsure of what the forms are and the sequence, this may be a good video to give basic insight.

Don't look to this video for instruction on stance, focus, technique, timing, proper rise and fall in katas. This video is more akin to Shotokan Kata dancing. As one that has been trained by and trained with the Japanese instructors, this instructor would get some giggles if he does this stuff in front of well ranked peers. His punches don't snap, kicks are weak, stances wobbly and bouncing up and down. The techniques show basic understanding of the movements but not connection with the bunkai. Well this is for instructional purposes you say, yes, I understand; but don't be weak.

A truly commercialized product typically lacking the soul of Shotokan Karate. Well produced though - I'll give it that much.",1390435200,3,1019,4.532608695652174
8190073,5,B000PAAJXI,"If you want to learn the katas, this video breaks down each move.  This helps student, and parent, to view each stance and verify if the student is making the correct moves.  This video shows the kata in real time, then the break down is slow, and seen from the front, back and side views.  Its a good tool for learning.",1376438400,,320,4.213114754098361
8190074,5,B000PAAJXI,"One of the best instructor I've ever seen way to go sensei Flores, he lives in Santa Fe I wish some day my family and I can meet him.

Congrats for this video is great",1370908800,,167,3.7714285714285714
8190075,5,B000PAAJXI,"I always find that great martial arts masters are always criticized, most often by people who do not have half their skill or experience. If they did, then they'd be putting out videos of their own.

I am sure that master Flores did not receive his rank and championships for nothing, so this man must know what he is doing.

I liked the video and found it very helpful.  He shows each kata at full speed, from various angles, and then a slow step by step explanation.",1368921600,,468,4.35632183908046
8190076,3,B000PAAJXI,"The production value of this DVD is great! Having said that, the execution of the kata themselves is only fair. I do refer to this DVD occasionally, but the best DVDs for Shotokan kata are those by Joel Ertl.",1292716800,,208,4.358974358974359
8190077,5,B000PAAJXI,"Steve Flores doesn't perform the katas to impress you. He performs the katas to TEACH you. That's why his katas might seem mechanical and lifeless. Nevertheless, his form is excellent and very appropiate for the purpose of the product.

Nobody can get inducted into the United States Karate Alliance Hall of Fame by doing poor katas, don't you think so?",1257724800,,353,4.883333333333334
8190078,2,B000PAAJXI,"I purchased this video as a reference for fine-tuning my kata. The production of this video was great. They showed all 4 angles of the form, along with practical applications of the techniques. What I did not appreciate was the poor form of Mr. Flores. His motion was robotic. There was no fluidity at all. Everything was telegraphed, his stances were shoddy, his head was bobbing throughout his steps, he did not marry his hand attacks with gravity, and so on. If I was a judge at a competition, I would give him a 3 out of 10 if he was a blue belt. For a so-called ""master"" to give a performance like this is shameful.",1208649600,7,620,4.353448275862069
