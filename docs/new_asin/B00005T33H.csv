1659441,2,B00005T33H,"I can't understand the rave reviews of the other people.  I guess if you've never exercised before or do not live a very active lifestyle this tape would be okay.  I was given this tape and didn't even break a sweat into the third mile, not to mention I was bored out of my mind.  What's with the ""walk, walk, walk, walk"" talk!  On the positive side this tape is a good start if you have not exercised in a very long time or if you are having a ""lazy"" day.  Otherwise, go for something that can get your heart rate up.  P.S.  You are not really walking, you are doing low impact aerobic moves.",1024272000,9,593,4.104347826086957
1659442,3,B00005T33H,"I added this tape to my library of 35+ exercise tapes because I absolutely crave variety.  If I use the same tapes too often I get bored and find myself making (and using!) excuses not to exercise.  This one fits nicely into the ""plain aerobic workout"" category, so it can be alternated with the FIRM-type workouts or plain weights workouts.
Segment 1 covers one ""mile"" at a fairly easy pace with a little arm movement.  Segment 2 is a slightly brisker 1.5 ""miles"", again with a little arm movement.  Segment 3 again covers 1.5 ""miles"", but the instructor includes more extensive arm movements.
If you're a dedicated exerciser, you may find the intensity a little low -- I have to use hand weights and lots of arm movements to keep my heart rate up, or jog in place instead of walking.  I also find the instructor a little annoying at times, and the tape doesn't really get me excited about exercising.  This is an ideal beginners' tape, though, since there is virtually no choreography.  All in all, a decent tape, but advanced exercisers may want to consider something more interesting like ""Donna-mite"" or ""Latin Rhythms"" for their plain aerobics days.",1023408000,19,1155,4.745
1659443,5,B00005T33H,"Myself and my dear friends that are members of the Hicks Weight Mangement team are hooked on the tapes.  These tapes are becoming a ritual for us.  There are so good.  Almost all of us have a set at home as well as we have one at the gym that we use as a courtesy of Dr. Hicks.  The tapes take you from not liking to walk to appreciating walking.  If it matters to anyone who is beginning these tapes are great, its the best investment you can make for taking care of you!!!!!!",1021075200,6,477,4.031914893617022
1659444,5,B00005T33H,"This video is great. I consider myself a intermediate exerciser, However it took me a while before I could complete the (3) miles.
It is easy to follow and challenging, I do not mind her talking.
I wanted to get this tape to use when I can't get outdoors or do not feel like getting dressed to go to the gym. I am very pleased. She even has a segment with weights, if you prefer you do not have to use weights. No floor work...I hate floor work, so this tape is awesome for me!!",1020384000,4,478,4.042105263157895
1659445,5,B00005T33H,"I received this dvd in the mail this afternoon from Amazon and popped it in my player immediately.  This is a great 49 minute  workout.  On my first try doing the workout, I could follow it! It really works your thighs and upper body.  She uses 2 lb ball weights but I just used my old 3 lb hand-held dumb-bells. You have the option of not even using them if the workout is too hard for you.  Leslie's basic techniques are simple to do, she cues very good, it's safe and yet it's fast-paced enough to get the heart rate up there. I have a bad back so I'm careful about the types of workouts I do (can't jog,  do kickbox-aerobics, ect).  This is finally a workout that really gets me sweating without moving all over the place trying to keep up.  Now, I'm sure there's those aerobic fanatics who'll say this workout is boring b/c of the repetitive moves, but I'm not trying to dance here.  I wanted a simple yet effective workout without injuring myself, one that I could do, one that I work up a sweat, and I finally found one on DVD!  I felt this was money well spent and I'll be doing this workout 2-3 times a week.",1018828800,45,1117,4.2018779342723
1659446,3,B00005T33H,"The exercises on this video really work up a good sweat, but I wish Leslie would stop the incessant yakking and keep her mind on what she's doing.  Telling us we're going to do knee lifts and then doing kickbacks throws everyone off.  And saying ""just a few more"" when she means anywhere from 12 to 42 more repititions is ridiculous.  Stop the commercials, anatomy lessons, and stupid talk and give us more on form - and more silence would be nice, too.  By the end of the tape I'm ready to strangle her.",1017705600,7,504,4.329787234042553
1659447,5,B00005T33H,"I have tried a lot of exercise videos over the years, and found the following problems with them: the instructor and background exercisers appeared to be ""Stepford Wives""; the music was irritating; the instructors were irritating; and finally, if you were not a professional dancer and/or in olympic competition physical condition, the routines were impossible to do. I just had my first child, and was finding it hard to get out of the house everyday to walk, so I decided to try one more exercise tape - ""Walk Away the Pounds"" - fantastic! Great workout, easy to do but really works muscles and cardiovascular - she builds in a nice balance of upper body work without compromising the ""fat burner/aerobic"" benefit. The 3 miles (I wore my pedometer, and it was close!) went by quickly and I know it was a much more beneficial workout than if I had just gone outside and walked 3 miles. You do not have to be coordinated or in shape to do this. If you can get up on your feet, you can do this exercise! Leslie is not too ""chatty"" and the music is just enough to keep you moving at the right intensity - mostly you don't even notice the music, it is there just to provide the tempo. If you're looking for some way to exercise, and don't want to join a class or use other tapes where you have to be a ""dancer"", get Leslie's tapes! Just wonderful!",1014940800,23,1344,4.423387096774194
1659448,5,B00005T33H,I really like this video!!! It is so great to have a great work-out and not feel like you have to jump through hoops to do it all! It is very simple moves... but a great fat burning work-out. I really recommend it!,1012521600,5,214,4.0
1659449,4,B00005T33H,"I have a reasonably large library of exercise videos and must rate this as one of my favorites.  The workout is a good one in that I really work up a sweat and can feel the burn, yet it is easy to follow with good cues and steps that aren't too complicated. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn't just exercise my legs, but also my arms, waist, and pretty much everywhere else, too. I also like the fact that it is possible to do the exercises with or without weights and can vary the intensity by making bigger or smaller movements. I am an avid walker, but living in New England means that I can't always actually walk outside so being able to get three miles in my living room is a very good thing!  The only negative is that Leslie just plain talks too much which I find annoying at times.  Fortunately, though, since you don't need every ounce of gray matter to follow the movements, it is easy enough to tune her out on those mornings when I would rather just exercise and not hear Leslie's banter.",1011657600,246,1014,4.270833333333333

1659496,5,B00005T33H,"I purchased Leslie Sansone-Walk Away the Pounds-Super Fat Burning-3 miles for my mom since she retired and wanted to get in shape. I ended up joining her on my cardio days because this DVD is so great! Its awesome to be able to walk 3 miles in your living room without having to go outside in the elements or drive just to do the same thing! I know that some people may say that walking in place is not the same as walking around for 3 miles, but either way moving is moving and I know I can work up a sweat doing this DVD. Additionally, since starting this DVD, my mom and I have both been able to walk further distances in places such as Disneyland without getting tired.

This DVD is made up of 5 basic movies:
-WALKING!
-Kickbacks
-Sidesteps
-Knee lifts
-Kicks

Together she combines these into a great 3 mile walk that is low impact on your joints but works up a sweat! The music and random encouragements throughout the video make this exercise a breeze and have me coming back for more. Additionally, there is a small weightlifting portion that just gives you a little calorie and fat burning boost! My mom uses 2lbs dumbbells and I used 5lbs dumbbells and I actually feel the burn! This is pretty great considering I weight lift about 3-4 times a week.

I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a nice low impact workout that really does give you a great work out.",1477267200,12,1386,4.385214007782102

1659581,5,B00005T33H,"Good addition to the other ""Walk Away the Pounds"" videos. We have now tried the one mile, two mile and three. Neither of us quite finished the 3 miles, but we are working up to it. What we like: a bar shows on the bottom of the screen every 1/2 mile, so you know where you are and can stop at an earlier point if needed. This one has more variety of movements than the others (one mile and two mile) and it is more intense. Both of us modified the movements somewhat. Leslie emphasizes that you should modify whenever you need to. The group walking with her is diverse - one male, women with different body types. She always has someone modifying the movements and/or not using the exercise balls.
Note: the balls are not necessary. We are using light weight regular weights and like them better than a ball. (Easier on the wrists). I have now looked at alternative low impact videos available on Spark People. So far Leslie is the best. She is a bit chatty, but I basically tune her out and follow the movements. I would recommend this video but with one caution - do not start with this one unless you are in good shape.",1425254400,4,1122,4.322274881516588

The only reason this didn't get five stars from me is that it is a bit repetitive of her other walking workouts - I just couldn't give it the five stars I gave her Walk Blasters dvd.  If you are looking for a good workout that is effective, yet easy to do (no complicated choreography or hard to do moves) this is a good dvd to get.  I didn't want to buy the little hand held weights used in the video, so I just wore my 3lb weighted boxing gloves for it.",1423094400,4,618,3.873015873015873

This is the first video I have used form Leslie where the walkers try to ""talk up"" the walk and what they say is super cheesy and annoying.

I never use her weights. I have my own 5lbs dumbells that do the trick, and I also strap 5lbs weights onto my ankles.  I am in no way in ""poor shape"" and this video still makes me sweat buckets! (with or without me adding the extra weights)

Leslie makes it so you have complete control over how great of a workout you'll get by doing either big or small movements right to the beat of the music.  She really helped me lose all my postpartum belly, and I'm sure she's still helping millions of people everyday :)

1659787,5,B00005T33H,"I purchased this DVD last November, after using Leslie's 1 and 2 mile Walk Diet for 3-4 months prior. After the first time I used it, I was totally drenched but felt very good. One of the best workouts I had in a long time!! This DVD is more intense than the first DVD I had and even the 4 mile DVD I got since then.
One of the best things I like about this DVD is the half-mile meter, letting you know how far you have gotten in your exercise. I believe it helps make the time goes faster and is also a motivater as well.
I noticed there was one miscue: when Leslie mentioned they were going to do knee lifts and ended up doing the opposite, a couple of the ladies started to do the knee lifts but quickly realized they were doing the other. I also noticed that near the end of the exercises, when Zleslie told the ladies to put the weights down, it appears as if one of the ladies put her weights down to close to one of the other ladies in front of her ( I think her name is Beth) from the front view, but from a different angle, it did not look that bad.
All in all, this DVD was superb! I would recommend it to anyone, even couch potatoes like myself!!",1331078400,,1157,3.9913793103448274

It was really a pleasant change from the other dvds because there are different people,different music and a different workout area. Also these are 15 minute miles which is slower than some other dvds so you can actually use the weights appropriately. She uses her own brand of 2lb weights but any weights or no weights up to 2 lbs will be fine to use. If you have the other workouts I say go & seek out some of the older ones. They add some change to it. Unfortunately I have to say that the tracking on the VHS tape was a little off but it was new and this could be due to age and my machine.

I love to walk, but wasn't real excited about being on the side of the road in traffic, rain or snow, and really not into being challenged by dogs that don't like walkers.

My sister told me about Leslie's 3 mile walking DVD.  I bought one. Wow! I'm a senior citizen, and I can really do this!  I can keep up with the pace of the music. The moves are managable.  Leslie's energetic, easy way of encouraging me, her information about the value of getting large muscle groups involved; getting oxygen all throughout the body and how aerobic exercise keeps the brain healthy all come together to help me feel good about myself.

Of course she will promote her trademark Walk Away Weights but the back of the DVD states that you can also use your own 2 pound dumbbells or opt not to use weight at all. I actually have a set of weighted gloves I held onto while doing the workout. It was great that Leslie gave special emphasis to the triceps which she often refers to as the ""trouble muscle.""  I am NOT as fond of the stretch bands she uses on a number of her tapes however. Thankfully this is NOT one of them.

Leslie begins this DVD by declaring that her (brisk) walking is a ""really wonderful way to get that body in the best shape ever."" She tells her audience to ""Get happy. Think positive.""  Karen, one of the women who exercises with her, ads that ""you can walk away a lot of health problems."" Good job Leslie Sansone!

Its takes about 50 minutes to do the full 3 miles, however the workout lets you know how far you've walked in 1/2 mile increments.

It is similar to her 1 Mile Get Up Get Started and 2 Mile High Calorie Burn, same setting, same cast, just a longer workout.  Beth shows modifications using smaller range of motion, and Randy demonstrates the workout without using the weighted balls.

The workout runs just over 45 minutes, once the warmup is complete, it gets pretty brisk until the mile and a half mark, then the weighted balls come out.  You will see the standard steps, walking in place, side steps, kicks and knee lifts, plus kickbacks here and there.

I have a nice little collection of Leslie workouts now, my choice of cardio has always been step but I have really enjoyed incorporating this into my routine recently. After all I can't do step every day, plus these are nice to have for those days I don't feel like step.  I get a good workout using Leslie, had I discovered her sooner perhaps I would have never fallen off the exercise wagon a couple years back.  Ah well, I am back on now and I feel great!  I will be interested to see what these do for me after several months.

At the end of this work out I didn't feel like I burned as many calories or got as good of a workout as I did with just the Walk At Home 3 Mile with no weights.  I thought adding the weights would feel like I burned more, but it didn't.

I also didn't like that this one was in a group.  I prefer her much more one-on-one.  When she gets in a group atmosphere I feel like she becomes way more annoying and chatters WAY too much.

Today I decided to go back to my Walk at Home 3 Mile and just add weights to that workout, and I felt much more calorie burn this time.

With all her videos so far, I'm also disappointed in her after workout stretching .  I don't feel any muscle tension release, so I don't even bother.  I do the cool down, but then do yoga stretches to relax and stretch my muscles.

I would say it would be beneficial for her to have some warm up stretching before she starts the walking, but given her poor stretching after the workout, I don't see what good it would do.

I'm sticking with the Walk At Home 3 Mile, adding weights to that routine, and doing yoga stretches after.

Overall, I like Leslie, I just don't think much of this workout.",1240444800,3,1390,4.103703703703704

1659908,5,B00005T33H,This DVD is the second Leslie Sansone I've tried. I'm working my way up in difficulty! Great walking aerobic challenge. You start walking to warm up and she always quickly reviews the basic steps and then after you're thoroughly warmed up you add walking with her weighted balls. I don't have those but you can add any small weights of your choice or at least I chose too.(she doesn't suggest that). I will order her balls soon. I have begun to lose weight too! So it must be working. Leslie is always peppy but not sappy which can be annoying on some exercise videos. I am seriously considering ordering more of her videos because I like her style. And walking is about the only thing I can do aerobic wise with my bad back. This one is a bit of a challenge to keep going with the weights at times (unlike the one and two mile versions) but even she suggests to put them down at anytime if you need to and one person in the video always demonstrates without weights.,1224892800,,967,4.348066298342541

On this one she seems to start at a faster pace than some of her others, and she keeps it up throughout, hence the ""Super Fat Burning"" in the title. The three mile walk is the ""farthest"" I've done so far, but I really feel good when I've finished this one. Workout-wise, I like that this one covers so much and is a little faster paced than some of her others.

The main downside to these videos is that they tend to get repetitive and boring, especially if you do the same one every day. I like to have some variety in my workouts, as I tend to want to quit when I get bored. My perfect solution to this has been to alternate Leslie's videos and do 2 or 3 different ones in a one week period. I actually look forward to doing them now!

Great things about walking at home with Leslie Sansone:
1. The walking is gentle for the joints and body. It never hurts me, like some dance videos would.
2. I don't need to buy a big bulky machine like a treadmill or elliptical, and then worry about having someone to come in and fix it when it breaks
3. Walk at home in any weather condition
4. Involves some upper body exercise too
5. Just the right level for me. I get a good exercise, but not so tired that it becomes a burden.

Bad things:
1. Leslie talks too much. But I turned the sound off anyway while I do the exercise.
2. I used to live on the top floor of an apartment, and I can not walk without disturbing my downstairs neighbors. Walking on a gym mat with no shoes help. Luckily, now I live on the ground floor.

Leslie's group does the upper body exercise by holding a 2 lb ball weight in each hand. To save money, I just used two bottles of water. Initially, I used the small bottles. Now, I use a 1 litter bottle. Filled with water, it is about 2.2 pounds.",1202256000,4,1217,4.105042016806722

There are different walkers in the background than the usuals - with the Walk Away the Pounds Express workouts, so it's kind of nice to see different people.

What I think I like about these workouts is that you can make them even more intense than they are.  Most of the times I add flexible hand/wrist weights to give me that little additional heart rate boost.

1659959,5,B00005T33H,"I don't typically leave reviews but this video was good enough to warrant one.

I recently purchased several more exercise videos to keep my daily routine from getting stale and this title was among them. I usually do 3 miles a day on a treadmill and wasn't quite sure what to expect from this.

The workout you get from this is much more thorough than what you can get from a treadmill alone while still remaining low impact. The miles speed by before you know it. The cueing was excellent and none of the moves were too complicated. I used 3-pound weights instead of the custom weights they were pitching and they worked just fine.

Leslie was a little too bright and chipper to suit my personality but much less so than some instructors who make me want to gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon.

Overall I'm very happy with this purchase though with as much energy as I still have at the end of the session, I probably should have gone with the 4-mile workout instead. An additional feature added to the video to extend the walk would have been nice. I would also prefer they kept the meter on the screen that displays your progress in miles instead of it just having it pop up every half mile or so.",1189987200,2,1203,4.357142857142857

I also love that her WATP videos know no age limit! The 1 mile is relaxing and energizing (a great ""after dinner"" walk). The 2 mile gets you to sweat a little, and the 3 mile is definitely a little more challenging, as there are added moves and it's a longer walk, but still very do-able.

The instructor, Leslie Sansone, is a little bit scary to me. Don't get mad if you're a big fan - I'm sure she's a lovely person. Nonetheless, in this DVD she's very Cheri O'Teri-ish and at times I found myself wondering if I was watching an SNL skit. Still, it's bearable and the bonus is that her antics are distracting and make the time fly by.

I especially liked the mile markers - they show you each 1/2 mile and mile increment. I found that it worked my butt and thigh muscles fairly well, especially just by adding the deeper lunges and heavier weights she recommends for the advanced users. (I use my own handheld weights - you don't need hers.)

Overall I'm pleased with the workout and would recommend it to others looking for a low-intensity way to shape up. I also own her Walk and Jog DVD. I haven't used it yet, but I watched it and it looks like a good workout to use when this DVD becomes too easy and I didn't notice her behaving like she did in this one (yay!).",1147305600,5,1203,4.110638297872341

However, with this video it is easy to complete this workout and you hardly realize how hard you have worked until you check your heart rate. All those other high impact,complicated choreography videos are nice, but unless you can finish it you won't burn the calories.

  The video consists of marching, kicks, knee-lifts and kickbacks. Around the 1.5 mile mark you start using small weights in simple movements. However, you don't have to use them if you don't want to. With these four basic movements you progress three miles and really get an excellent workout. Although Leslie is a little chatty and can be a bit cheesy it wasn't enough to deter me from working out. This is especially great for people who are just getting back into exercising, like myself,because the workout is so very doable that you can stick with it.

You have the chubby woman, the woman with washboard abs, the woman who looks like a toothpick, the black woman and, of course, the token male.  In this case, it's Randy.

After about 3 weeks I tried the 3 mile and found it had me gasping for air, and my heart rate was just way too high so I kept up with the 2 mile. I'd say it took me about 1 1/2 months before I was able to complete the 3 mile without feeling discomfort. I definitely feel so much more energetic and stronger.

Before trying out this set I used the Gazelle which really didn't seem to work me out at all. I'm very pleased with this workout technique being as I'm not too found of high-impact fancy dance moves.

The usual features that make this series great for me are still there. I'm not the most coordinated person, so I personally love the fact that she uses fairly easy, basic, repetitive moves. I also don't have a huge area in which to workout. This can be done in a small space. I also love that you can adjust the intensity up and down (either with weights or with some of the movements).

A few caveats: it's harder for me to find a 50 minute block of time to exercise; and some of the lead-in to the moves could be better. Also, as others have pointed out, the stretching afterward is inadequate. The chatter does get annoying very quickly, but I just turn the sound down.",1122940800,3,953,4.118279569892473
1660129,3,B00005T33H,"I have been doing Leslie's 2 mile, 30 minute workouts for a few months now.  I decided it was time for me to take it to the next level and try this 3 mile workout, which clocks in at just under 50 minutes.

The workout is certainly effective:  it gets my heart rate up and works the total body.  However, when I do it, I just can't wait for it to be over.  It's exactly like her WATP 1 and 2 mile set, except longer.  The movements are exactly the same, and nothing new has been added.  Foot work ranges from marching in place, side steps, knee lifts, kicks, and kick backs.  Upper body motions are a bit more varied and include lateral raises, bicep curls, lifting hands up, spreading them out to the side, or in front of you.  You do one movement for 8-16 counts, then walk, then move on to the next movement.  This is a very simple system that is helpful for people who have never worked out and are intimidated by complicated choreography.  However, the longer you do it, the more boring it gets.  50 minutes is just too long to be doing these same movements.  You'd think that once you can get to the point that you can work out for 50 minutes straight, you could handle a bit more variety in motion.  I know I can.  Also, the music is bland and not very motivating.  Its main function is to give you a beat to keep time to.  Leslie is her usual talkative self, making cheesy jokes with her exercisers.  I'm considering trying to turn off the sound and play my own cd instead, but I'm concerned about the beat not matching what they're doing on the screen.  I think it's the only way I will be able to continue this workout, though, as it's so boring.

Leslie spends a great deal of time advertising her weighted balls, which are used for about 20 minutes of the workout, although she points out that the weights are not necessary, especially for someone who is in poor shape.  If you want to add weights, I recommend buying some cheap 2-3 lb dumbbells, which are just as effective and much cheaper than her weighted balls.",1122422400,69,2028,4.298153034300792

These are the only tapes that I have ever been able to complete in a very short time, and that I do over and over.  The steps are very easy to do.  The music isn't all that, but if I turn it down, it tends to mess up my workout as I'm trying to get back into pace when she changes the moves.  I have lost almost 3 inches off of my six baby belly, and almost 10 pounds since starting these three months ago - and I do them anywhere from once a week to five days in a row...all depending on how I manage my time.

The only bad thing I would have liked to know is that they use the Walk Away the Pounds weights, which are balls.  I have yet to find these at a reasonable price.  You can do the workout without them - I actually have substituted cans of vegetables or fruit!

1660133,4,B00005T33H,"Why I usually make a mistake buying a cardio video is mainly because I am extremely uncoordinated, so I am totally hopeless at those workouts that feature more than two movements at the same time. Even though I've been working out on a regular basis for an eternity, I still feel like I do need some cardio exercises, so I thought I'd give Ms. Sansone a try.

I can already say it was a great decision. WATP - Super Fat Burning is easy to complete as far as the steps go (even for me, and believe me, it IS something), but it still keeps the heart-rate up (even that of a 90-something pound regular exerciser like myself) for a good 45 minutes, so it is guaranteed to burn some unwanted and loathed fat.

My small cocerns that finally made me give it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star one are the fact that I'm not really sure you can keep with this practice without growing bored of it and that stretching is pretty much neglected, so it could give you some serious, unwanted muscle burn the next morning.

Another nice thing about the tape is that even though they use Ms. Sansone's own ""Walking Weights"" (or whatever they call them), which first reminded me of the rip-off mentality typical of those new The Firm tapes, you can easily substitute them with a couple of light handweights (I use my 3 lbs. ones), so you aren't FORCED into buying something that you'll only use for one particular workout.",1115596800,4,1406,4.4

When I decided to change my life and get into shape, I weighed an astounding 292 pounds but after about 3 1/2 months I have lost 33 pounds and still losing.

Her 4 mile express video is great too but it doesn't focus much on the upper body and I like working every part of me. I never knew that doing leg exercises are the best way to slim your waist line but after using this video my waist has shrunk and I have even retired some of my clothes cause they were falling off of me.  Don't get me wrong you still have to watch whatt you eat and exercise on a regular basis.  I do this video atleast 5 days per week and I still eat whatever I want but only in moderation.

If you don't like her chattiness, make a workout mix CD and turn down the volume on the TV.

Most of the steps are repeated throughout the walk.  This is good if you're not a dancy, aerobic person but still want a good cardio workout.  I have no arm-leg coordination so this was perfect for me.

I workout 5-6 times a week and I can sweat good with this one, it's simple to do, VERY easy to follow and no complicated footwork. She's a very ""happy"" Person in all her videos, but I'd rather listen to her any day over Richard simmons (gross)! Anyway this is a good buy for those Cardio days.

It's easy to follow along, even when I can't hear what she's saying due to a multitude of electronic toys singing their obnoxious melodies around me thanks to the kids.  I would like more stretching at the end, but I end up just doing more stretching on my own since all my muscles are nice and warm after the 3 mile walk.  I usually work out with Denise Austin tapes, this is my first Leslie Sansone workout and I'm very impressed.  I though Denise was as ""user friendly"" as you could get, boy was I wrong!  I would recommend this to people in all levels of fitness.

I'm pretty active - I am in a kickboxing class and am a big fan of the Precor elliptical machines at the gym and make my main workout about 45 minutes of heavy duty elliptical sweating.

I love this Leslie video because it's the perfect length - 45 minutes including a light warmup and cool down. I tend to use this on days when I don't feel like going to the gym or sometimes in addition to my kickboxing class. The moves are simple enough for someone like me who doesn't like the typical aerobics classes in which I spend more time trying to figure out the moves and dance steps rather than focus on intensity.

This 3 mile WATP video is simple to follow and does let me break a sweat and my muscles feel like I've worked. Not as intense as a run on the elliptical, but it does get the heart rate up and calories burning. The girls on the tape do chatter a bit, but I don't think it's a bad chatter.

1660156,5,B00005T33H,"Last fall, when I first heard about Leslie's workout tapes, I bought the 3-DVD set of the 1-mile, 2-mile and 4-mile DVDs.  I was able to move quickly from the 1-mile to the 2-mile, but going from there to the 4-mile proved much more challenging.  I thought I'd try a 3-mile as a middle step until I could easily get through the 4-mile and bought this one earlier this year.

I love it!  Things I like alot:  1) there are more people participating in the workout; 2) Leslie has MUCH more interaction with the people in the workout; 3) the set/studio where the DVD is filmed is a hundred times better; 4) the transitions in music/pace are a hundred times better; 5) the music, while not hugely inspiring, is good; and 6) while it's a shallow and silly thing, this DVD is MUCH more up-to-date than the others and I don't have to look at terribly outdated workout outfits and hairdos anymore. :)

I have no major dislikes.  After watching/listening to the DVD repeatedly over a course of months, there are LITTLE things that bug me like the fact that Leslie so often refers to ""the girls"" and ignores the fact that there is a man participating (Randy).  I noticed that Randy was dressed differently than the girls (their outfits are all in a matching color scheme and by the same company), so I wondered if maybe Randy was a ""fill-in"" for someone who couldn't make it at the last minute and therefore Leslie was used to it being all girls and kept forgetting he was back there (he was in the back row).

With these tapes it only takes 30 minutes of your day, and you can do it while the baby is napping! I think Leslie is great, she is so energetic and she really has a positive attitude. I don't mind the chatter aT all! I Walk Away the Pounds 6 days a week and take Sundays off. 3 times a week I do Winsor Pilattes just for an extra kick. It relly feels good to walk and then do all the stretching pilattes involves. The walking was a great addition to the pilattes, great cardio!
I reccomend these tapes to anyone!!! THANKS LESLIE!!!",1078185600,4,788,3.9936708860759493
1660184,4,B00005T33H,"They say to avoid most ""converts"" because of their annoying and over zealous turn-abouts of behavior.  Leslie Sansone's walk aerobic programs may just make you the exception to that rule!  Her Walk Away The Pounds workouts are energetic, inspiring, effective and just plain addictive!  For anyone who has lived a sedentary life (like me) or just got complacent about those extra pounds that refused to let go - these workouts will transform you body and soul.  Not to mention you'll have a blast all along the way.
I'm new to WATP, but it didn't take long to become a full-fledged Sansone groupie.  In only 6 weeks I have gone from disgusted with my condition to truly energized, motivated and committed to getting fit.  Leslie did that for me and she can do it for you.  Forget about sabotaging your success by choosing workouts that will sooner give you cardiac arrest than a good healthy workout.  Instead, ""walk away the pounds"" to a leaner, stronger and more self-confident you.  All it takes is faith, a pair of walking shoes and a few weeks.  Prepare for changes in your endurance and stamina that you never believed possible - AND - in no time at all you will see physical results that will make you jump on the band wagon just like I did.
A few suggestions though...
1) Make a commitment to exercise every day for at least six weeks (how much doesn't matter) and hide your scale!  Your enthusiasm may get deflated if you don't see rapid weight loss and that is a land mine to avoid.  In the first few weeks your body will try to figure out what the new demands of exercise mean.  More than likely, you will feel roomier in your clothes long before your scale responds.  Do not despair!  Weight loss IS happening.
2) Don't undo exercise progress by eating like an orangutan.  Either choose a sensible diet plan to accompany your workouts, or commit to making better food choices.  It will pay off and you will be amazed how much faster you will see positive results.
3) Don't feel obligated to purchase the Walk Away Weighted Balls if you already have light dumbells.  I have both and prefer the dumbells - they are easier for me to hold and don't get slippery in my hands when I sweat.  Also, I can increase and decrease the weight depending on how strong I feel on any particular day.
4) Enjoy the adventure!  If your brain clicks the way it should, exercising will become something you look forward to doing every day.  You will adapt it into your daily routine and it will be the catalyst for a lifestyle change you won't want to live without.  Work at a manageable pace and focus on your goals.  If you ever feel like you're losing motivation - give yourself a day or two off and reconsider the quality of your life without fitness.  The ""pain"" is inconsequential to the gain.  Trust me.
Finally - I am the last person on earth who should be spouting on and on about exercise since I spent most of my life relaxing on my ""backside.""  If I can break the cycle of gaining weight and being lazy - anyone can.  I have already shed 22 pounds since January 9th and though I have 50 more to go, I'll be in a bikini by July. Call me a convert, I don't care... I'm proud!'
On a technical note: This program requires a little extra concentration since the vocal cues seem a little spontaneous at times and there is one miscue that confuses knee lifts with kick-backs.  No big deal, but compared to the WATP Express 4-Mile Super Challenge, this isn't quite as smooth.  Have fun!",1078012800,29,3480,4.479365079365079

Instead, it leaves you ready to take on the rest of your day.  My daughter likes doing the exercise with me, she is soon to be 6 years old..  So that tells you how easy the routine is to follow.  I enjoy the music and it is wonderful to be cheered on.  I also like the chatting that goes on during the video.  I really like they have all women of different sizes they aren't all dress size 2. Nice to know they aren't robots, just smiling through the workouts.  I also like the meter that appears at the bottom of the screen it keeps you motivated.

1660186,5,B00005T33H,"Leslie is the ""Queen of In-Home Walking."" This is different than walking on a treadmill, but seems equally effective. You can also walk any day of the year, rain or shine, day or night. There are no limits.

Leslie travels all over the world promoting fitness and holds six certificates from the American College of Sports Medicine. She also owns Club Fitness and makes appearances on the QVC Home Shopping Channel.

After trying a few of Leslie Sansone's workouts, this is now my favorite workout.

This Super Fat Burning - 3 Mile workout took me to new places in my fitness level. I really saw some good results in the stomach area. I had to keep looking in the mirror to make sure it was true. This workout firms the upper and lower body, improves coordination and balance and boosts cardio strength. (47 minutes)

Since I'm not the queen of coordination, the Leslie Sansone workouts allow me to exercise without worrying about fancy footwork. If you can stand in one place and move forward, back and put your arms up and down, you can do this! Therefore, this is really for anyone! The use of weights really takes this video to a new level. This workout really does tighten and tone you all over.

I highly recommend this workout or the three workout set with weights. This workout is for anyone starting a new workout program or for anyone who just wants to have a little fun with their workouts. You just become one of the group and Leslie creates a very friendly, accepting environment. I really started to look forward to working out in such a positive environment and enjoy being in the presence of some positive energy, plus it gave me an added boost of ""I can do this."" The music also just keeps you moving!

If you have a 5' x 7' space anywhere near a TV, these are perfect. You don't need a lot of room like many aerobic videos require.

Leslie's workouts that add a smiley burst of energy to your day. If you are on your couch, you better be looking out for Leslie Sansone cause she is going to ""come over and get you"" off that couch! At least that is what she says. ;)

I sent my aunt the 1-mile workout and she now says that
she does the workout with my little second cousin who is
now living at her house. So apparently even kids love
Leslie's workouts.

1660187,5,B00005T33H,"I like Leslie a lot, and I have worked my way through the 1 and 2 mile tapes to get to this one (have ordered the 4-mile in anticipation of moving on to that).  This tape is extremely simplistic as far as moves, which may be a little too repetitive for some, but I like it as I can zone out and not have to concentrate on following complicated movements.  And young, very fit folks may find the workout a bit too easy, but I think it's perfect for us older exercisers.  I wish she spent just a little more time stretching at the end, but you can do that on your own.
After about a dozen times or so, once you know the routine, you start to notice little things.  Subtle interactions among the people behind her.  Leslie's smile-through-gritted-teeth when her response to ""Beth""'s comeback about being short is to say ""We'll be losing that"" (but they left it in, gritted teeth and all).  Little things like those hold your interest.  I like watching ""Randy"" in the back.

It's easy and easy on my knees too.  I enjoy the mile markers she uses for motivation.  Everyone on the DVD looks happy.  I enjoy the health tips she gives for motivation.

The addition of the hand weights (she endorses her walk-away weights, I just used normal dumbbells) adds a bit of strength training into there too.

I tried the one mile walk first and had no trouble with it. So, the second day I jumped right into the two mile walk and I felt great.  The second week I decided I could handle the three mile walk and I've been there ever since.
The moves are easy, but not too repetitive so I don't get bored. I love putting my arms to work during these walks for an upper-body workout.  I also enjoy seeing normal people working out with me and it is reassuring to hear Leslie say I can't mess up this workout.  And did I mention what a challenge it is?

Because I weight train three times a week, I opt not to use the weights, which Leslie incorporates into the routine about 25 minuets into it, which means the last mile is sort of a cool down for me.

If you hate traditional exercise videos, this is the one for you!",1050364800,9,787,4.510489510489511
1660251,3,B00005T33H,"I have never worked out to her other tapes, I went straight to the 3 mile. I work out often so this routine was not difficult for me. I did not even break a sweat. Afterwards, I did feel a little burn in my thighs, but that is because I squated more in the workout than Leslie called for. This is not enough of a work out for my daily use, but, it will be real nice on the days when I just don't have the energy for a full blown workout.
I found Leslie to be nice but not annoying.",1049846400,,481,3.772277227722772
1660252,5,B00005T33H,"I have used all 3 of the Walk Away the Pounds videos. Its great to be able to choose between a 15, 30 or 45 minute workout, depending on how much time and energy you have. I love using the walk away weights, as well. I have lost weight, and trimmed inches, as well as toned my arms with these videos. They are much easier to follow than most aerobic videos, too.",1048377600,5,362,4.041666666666667
1660253,5,B00005T33H,"Wow! Just tried this video and know that it will be a great addition to my cardio workouts! I usually walk outdoors to get my cardio/fatburning in, but since I've found this I'll not have the excuse of inclement weather or darkness to deter me. This not only gets your heart rate up, but it also adds some light hand weights about midway to do some upper body toning as well as giving you some added resistance for some of the leg moves. Before popping this in, I thought that it might be quite boring, just giving me no excuses to skip my walks in the winter, rain, or after dark. But, this was great! I will definately add it to my rotation of workout videos and highly recommend it for any fitness level. It's a 45 min. walk, which is 3 miles, considering that you walk a 15 min. mile. You will definately get the 3 miles in, as there is a definite beat that you stay with, which keeps you on track. There are lots of added moves, none of which are complicated or confusing. These give you some added toning in both the lower and upper body as well. Beginners could do this video by taking it down a notch or simply walking, and/or leaving out the added weights when they were feeling too winded. Advanced exercisers could get a good cardio workout by keeping up with her, utilizing all upper and lower body moves. It's definately not boring! She's got a great personality without being too perky or talking down to you as if you were a child. You feel like you're part of the class. I've always known that power walking is excellent for getting your cardio in, but this takes it up a notch, and you really feel like you're getting more done than just the cardio/fat burning. No wonder she's been so successful and has lots of videos to choose from.",1048377600,4,1752,4.344512195121951
1660254,4,B00005T33H,"Whew! I never thought walking would be so intense (okay, excluding the whole power walking thing). This DVD gives you a great workout without tiring you out like most exercise videos do. It has a great pace to it and takes into account all levels. It definitely isn't hard to keep up with. Well, worth the money.",1046044800,4,312,4.491228070175438
1660255,4,B00005T33H,"I really enjoyed this simple, but exciting and energetic workout.  It felt really great to get to the 3 mile mark, and I didn't even realize the time passing.  However, I would've liked a bit more stretching at the end.  My muscles were very warm and pliable and the few minutes of stretching really didn't satisfy me.  If I had  more time (I've got 1 hour budgeted into my schedule every day) perhaps a nice yoga workout afterward would be nice.  Being the busy girl that I am, a 1.5 to 2 hour workout just is a bit much.  Anyways, if you don't mind only a bit of stretching, this is the workout for you.  For me however, I might go with the 2 mile (35 minutes) workout paired with a shorter yoga or pilates dvd afterward.",1041552000,4,723,4.226277372262774
1660256,5,B00005T33H,"Leslie Sansone won herself a whole new audience with the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs. These workouts are a wonderful way to get fit for people of all ages and fitness levels. This DVD features the 3-mile walk, for more advanced walkers. If you have completed her 1-mile and 2-mile Walk Away Workouts, this is your next challenge.
The moves are very simple:
- knee lifts
- kick backs
- side steps
- kicks
- and of course, walking
To create more intensity, she has you stepping out further, squatting into the moves, and using light weights. While she promotes the ""Walk Away Weights"" in the DVD, light hand weights (2 - 3 pounds) can be substituted, just be sure to watch your form.
A helpful meter appears along the way, to show you just far you've walked. Leslie's warm demeanor and encouragement really keep you motivated to make it to 3 miles. Leslie also ""puts a little heaven into it"" and asks us to ""count your blessings every day.""
The workout can be customized to fit your lifestyle, and that is one of it's greatest features. When you're looking to work harder, squat down, push yourself, and use the weights. On days that you're just not feeling 100%, skip the weights and still get a great cardio workout.
If you enjoy working out at home, this is a must-have workout. Thank you Leslie!",1040256000,92,1295,4.538461538461538
1660257,5,B00005T33H,"My friend Alisa and I tried Leslie's 3 mile walk away the pounds tape when we checked it out at the library. It is one of the best things that has happened to our on again off again weight loss. So many times we contemplated over tapes. This one was perfect for us and Leslie's talking was wonderful to us because we realized that the calming and instructual voice was the voice of a christian.
We loved the excersize and we loved hearing the praises that was coming from her spiritual heart. Thank you Leslie for sharing your SPIRITUAL GIFT with us. God bless you. Keep on sharing your grace and wisdom. You have certainly allowed the Holy Spirit to work through you to help those of us who can not always pound the pavement or hit the street to walk. Not to mention the ones like me who have had back surgery and can't take all the high impact but still needs to sweat. Your tape is a real blessing to us. It is always good when you know the light of Christ is visible in a person that you have never actually met. We feel the equivilant of a great and meaningful work out when we are done. It is motivating and easy enough for a child that may be experinceing obesity and have a hard time keeping up with other aerobic tapes. Or for people who have never been active in excersizing. Thank You again.

1660268,5,B00005T33H,"I am thrilled to come across Leslie's Fat Burning 3 mile workout.  I have done a variety of exercise tapes and find that you have to be too coordinated or a gymnast to get the benefits of a lot of them.  In this tape there are 4 basic movements with the legs and she slowly adds in arm work that is very do-able.  I have completed losing 90 pounds, and am trying to maintain that loss (which I find harder than the losing!) and Leslie is helping me get through the cold Nova Scotia winter with an indoor walking workout.  The workout goes fast and doesn't put you in any compromising positions - AND my 4 year old daughter can complete these simple moves with me and I don't have to worry about her hurting herself when she wants to join in.  I would recommend this video to anyone, any age, any size, any ability.  It is adaptable to everyone and she shows you how to do that.  I have not used the Walk Away weights yet, but find still get enough out of it without them.  I think that this video combined with a good ab or pilates workout is all you need!  Good luck to all of you.",1038268800,2,1082,4.114285714285714
1660269,1,B00005T33H,"After reading so many rave reviews online, I decided to give the tape a try. I have to say I was extremely disappointed and didn't even make it through the entire tape. Since I wear a heart monitor during all my workouts, I was waiting to see how long it would take to get to my target range; about 15 minutes into the tape (and I was pushing myself as hard as I could), I didn't even break the low end of my range. If you are just starting out, it would be a great, easy workout to try, but I would not recommend it for those who have been working out for a few years.",1034035200,10,569,3.913793103448276
1660270,5,B00005T33H,"I have used Leslie's workout tapes for 2 weeks now and I can't believe how great I feel.  I have alot more energy.  You get a really great workout when you use these tapes, upper body as well as lower body.  The tapes are very easy to follow if your new to exercise tapes. There are not alot of moves to remember in fact my husband started doing the tapes with me and he has lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks, I've lost about 7.  Please try these tapes. I feel guilty if I have a busy day and think I can't fit one in, the one mile tape gives you a good workout in only 20 minutes.",1030665600,10,573,3.830508474576271
1660271,5,B00005T33H,"I have used this tape for 6 weeks and it has worked for me. I have lost 15 pounds and feel great. It's challenging yet not too complicated to follow. If you are interested in losing weight, not learning dance moves this is your dvd.",1029628800,9,232,4.177777777777778
1660272,5,B00005T33H,"Wow:These tapes are the best I have found of all the walking tapes available. I have a pedometer and checked it against how far she claims you travel in miles on the tapes. It seems to be accurate! I started out with the one mile tape and after 3 days was able to do all 3 tapes plus her 4 mile tape. I became so addicted to them I do it every day with dumbells and ankle weights on. I am up to 10 miles a day. The tapes are in real time the class is upbeat and I feel like I am really part of an actual class! I am in great shape and losing wt and inches now thanks to doing them daily. I look forward to them. Its just makes exercise fun . and an eagerly anticipated AM activity. I love the 3 mile tape the best. It takes about 40 min to get the Endorphin runners high going but... it works to get you there! I am a fan for life of this woman! She is a bit chatty but that is part of her charm and style. I highly recommend them. I made the mistake of buying a Denise Austin ""trimwalk tape""-hated it, and took it back the next day. Compared to Leslie's tapes. I thought
Denise Austin seemed like an over bearing egotistical, misdirected moron. I truly disliked the bowling and basketball steps, how stupid. She goes too fast is disorganized and talks in a vapid, air headed half whisper very irritateing. It's a total waste of  your money. Leslie-your my girl, Denise needs to take walking instructions from you. Thanks I love your class. See you in the AM for my 7-10 mile body rush! D.Allen",1028073600,14,1494,4.098976109215017

For the last 8 to 10 years it has been very difficult to find an excercise program that I can consistently stick with.  (And make progress). I started June the 17th of this year. By July 17th I had lost ten pounds.  I was so excited and shocked.  I have been following religiously a low fat diet, too. (And nothing after 6 pm).

1660274,4,B00005T33H,I just recently started exercising again so this tape is great for the out of shapers like me.  I would rather walk outside but when it gets over 100 degrees this tape comes in handy. I can see where it would get a little boring for some people.  I agree with some of the other reviewers.  It does get a little cheesy in places but I do recommend the tape.,1027468800,3,356,4.057142857142857
1660275,4,B00005T33H,"I really like this DVD. I think the workout is too easy as it is, so I kicked high, squatted low, and carried five pound weights throughout--but this just shows how wonderfully adaptable the workout is for all needs,levels,abilities. It is a great way to work up a sweat without both feet leaving the  ground at once (hard on the joints).
The production quality is excellent, and the class members' collective attitude is really wonderful, upbeat, and genuine. I think I got my money's worth on this one.",1027296000,2,504,4.7272727272727275

I'm about 35 pounds overweight and am age 40, so I do break a little bit of a sweat, but the workout itself is painless and kind of fun.  Not only does the walking help build leg strength, but the upper body moves are also helping me to tone up my arms and back.  I have some other videos, but this one is my favorite and the one I least dread.  I like the fact that the walkers in the background are all shapes and ages and they even have one walker that does an ""easier"" version of the moves.  No fancy dance steps or complicated routine here - just straight forward exercise.  On the video they use ""walk-away-the-lbs."" weights, but I use 3 lb. hand weights and they work just fine. Couple this with an ab workout and this should be all you need to stay toned and healthy.",1025395200,37,952,4.113513513513514
