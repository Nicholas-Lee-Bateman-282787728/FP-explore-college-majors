4429636,5,B004MCPUWU,"This is a William Wyler documentary filmed upon an aircraft carrier built and commission after Pearl Harbor. This hour plus long documentary filmed in color was screened in theaters in 1944 about a couple months or so after the operations had taken place. It shows life aboard this newly commissioned aircraft carrier as it sails southward from its eastern seaboard home port through the Panama Canal, as she was designed too do, and onto her destination, the Pacific Theater of Operations. This gray lady goes on to see much action in the Pacific theater of operations.

We see everything from daily life of preparing meals, doing laundry, to the pilots and crews who this great class of ship was built for. And you are aware that ever person on the ship also has a combat station with preassigned duties. The documentary has the first plane landing on the new floating runway through the many hard fought engagements that comprised the attacks on Marcus Island, Kawjalen, Truk, and Battle of the Philippine Sea known as ""The Marianas Turkey Shoot."" All footage if actual combat footage that was extremely well done.

Robert Taylor, USNR, does the narration and does an excellent job in explaining what is not only obvious but the feelings the crew felt at the time of the filming. Though his narration does not convey the stress and boredom that waiting for actual combat entails he does share these truths. The film though obviously edited for the American public does show even the loss of life and burial at sea of the men loss in warfare. Well done documentary made to inform and garner support for war bond drive. Well worth getting though it would have been even better if released in wide screen.",1283385600,2,1705,4.795918367346939
4429637,5,B004MCPUWU,"THIS MOVIE WAS DEFINITELY A DOCUMENTARY OF A WARSHIP CARRIER OF THE WESTERN PACIC DURING WORLD WAR II.....SINCE HAVING SERVED IN THE NAVY SEVERAL YEARS AGO....I GOT TO LEARN ABOUT CARRIER LIFE ABOARD THIS WARSHIP, AND ITS MEN...ESPECIALLY ITS AIR WING COMPONENT....",1281398400,,265,5.333333333333333
4429638,3,B004MCPUWU,"One needs to keep in mind that this film was made in 1944 for the folks back home, so it conveys how life was on a carrier - in a general way.  I was a little disappointed in picture quality - most of the scenes were captured on 16mm film.  It's fairly interesting for a couple of viewings, but it's not going to be a permanent part of my collection.",1280707200,2,350,3.9857142857142858
4429639,1,B004MCPUWU,I was very disappointed with this movie as it was not done well at all.  Very hard to follow and I would not recommend to anyone and I am willing to really just trash it.  Don't waste your money.,1271030400,3,195,3.9743589743589745
4429640,5,B004MCPUWU,"Most of the footage in this documentary is original, I have not seen it in places like ""War In The Pacific"" or ""The World At War"". It is a great narrated look at live and operations in an aircraft carrier. The Great Wing Camera footage alone justifies the purchase.",1270339200,,265,4.428571428571429
4429641,5,B004MCPUWU,I ordered this because my grandfather served aboard the USS Yorktown (The fighting lady).  He never talked about his ordeal.  The movie does not glorify war.  It shows you the horror and the bravery.  It will instill in you a profound sense of pride and appreciation for those that fought for our freedom.  God Bless them all.,1269820800,,326,4.649122807017544
4429642,5,B004MCPUWU,"If you want to see what it is like on an aircraft carrier during WWII this is one to see. I paid ten cents per visit to see this movie, four times one summer, in the local theater shortly after it was released. I was really impressed. The DVD should be as good as the ""real mccoy"" when it was shown in a theater. I still get tense when watching the action. I was an aviator and feel the emotion and situations shown.",1267574400,,416,4.024096385542169
4429643,4,B004MCPUWU,"I knew going in that this was a documentary about WW2 aircraft carriers, more of a compilation than about one specific ship.  I found it interesting to see some of the inner workings of a fighting ship.  Remember that this was released while the war was still going on so it leans on the patriotic to a large degree.  The price was too good to pass up adding this to my collection.  Production quality is just ok.",1266883200,2,413,4.324675324675325
4429644,5,B004MCPUWU,"It's a truly wonderful trip into the time when the destiny of the world was being decided.  These are some of the young men who fought for our right to live free.  These are the men of ""the greatest generation"" as young men just then becoming great.  This is the real thing - 16mm movie film clips taken on the spot.  It's not a recreation or imagined story or modern movie about what happened then.  It is the actual men, the actual machines and the actual happenings - as it happened while it was happening.  And, although the color is faded and sometimes not true, although the narration may seem a little hokey or biased and, although if it was made with a consumer video camera today it would be technically a lot better - this movie IS 1943 and so is everything about it.  Strap into the time machine and go aboard the carrier for a little while and see what these heroes were doing - as they were doing it.  It's a wonderful experience.",1264809600,,943,4.318181818181818
4429645,5,B004MCPUWU,I found this movie to be interesting because the viewer gets to see the young men working with what was the technology of the time.,1264809600,,131,4.28
4429656,4,B004MCPUWU,Very enlightening to my non-historian view.  But for a movie from that general time it does give a view into possible life on an aircraft carrier.  A little light on historical context.  It is valid for some of the routine life on a WW II carrier.  The action is relevant for the time period.  Enjoyable.,1443139200,,304,4.454545454545454

Of course the radio (no TV yet), newspapers, magazines and movies played up the war news. it probably dosen't effect most people today because they just can't relate to what happened back then.",1414800000,2,361,4.402985074626866

4429699,1,B004MCPUWU,This is the first negative review I have written. But I have to be honest with you guys. Very disappointing documentary by Robert Taylor,1389312000,,136,4.708333333333333
4429700,5,B004MCPUWU,"One can see why many loved military service  and found readjusting
to civilian life difficult. Teamwork kept this great warship
running, its planes flying. Thousands  of Navy and Air Force guys
working together aboard ship 24-7, giving their all. Where was that
kind of teamwork and dedication back home?  Where was there
more challenge and excitement? Where was it easier to make friends?
Crackerjack pilots came home to dull nine-to-five desk jobs. Navy
men came home to bouts with loneliness and depression, they so
missed the camaraderie aboard ship. Comrades wrote letters to
each other for awhile, then dropped out of touch.

4429702,4,B004MCPUWU,"This was a story put out in WWII when America needed heros. Robert Taylor narriated the srory of an American carrier that went through battles in the Pacific, some winners and some lossers, with the intent of increasing American moral in a troubled time of fear and uncertanty among the American people. Of cource these were the newsreels seen in theaters around the country diring wartime.

4429718,5,B004MCPUWU,"Though this compilation of scenes does a commendable job of portraying the actions of our carriers in the Pacific War, it is an even better snapshot of the lives of individual sailors.  I really enjoyed the background scenes of games, smoking, no obesity, and the casual intensity with which a nation of individualists formed cohesive groups on our fighting ships.  Conditions were somewhat primitive by today's standards, and it was a treat to watch this film a number of times.",1375833600,2,479,4.975

4429733,4,B004MCPUWU,"Unlike today, during WWII Hollywood was more than happy to offer motion picture talents like OSCAR winning film maker William Wyler to direct this ""newsdrama"" to give the families at home encouragement regarding what America's ""Greatest Generation"" was doing to win the war in the Pacific.  The movie is centered around one of the Navy's new aircraft carriers built since Pearl Harbor known as The Fighting Lady.  Color footage is 16mm shot by the Navy and covers the ship and it's pilots as they take on the Japanese in the Pacific in 1943.  Some scenes are dark and difficult to see, but actually add character to the drama and action of real men fighting a real enemy.  You can almost smell the gun smoke, oil and human carnage as you grip the arms of your chair with intense emotion knowing that brave people were dying for the cause of freedom and heroes were being made.  Commentary is by one of Hollywood's finest actors, Lieut. Robert Taylor, US Navy Retired.  The ending is gripping as one watches burials at sea of some of the men featured in the film.  War is hell and these brave men knew FREEDOM isn't FREE but stepped up anyway to pay the price to fight for God, Country, and Family.  I thank God for these men who sacrificed so much so I could grow up in the 1950s feeling safe and have opportunities ahead I could never have imagined.

4429735,5,B004MCPUWU,"A semi-documentary, more of a promotional film for the home front. Well done for its time. I purchased this a gift for my uncle, who was on second Yorktown '43 - '45. I sat and watched it with him and he recognized some of the clips were from the Yorktown, as well as other carriers. I did not know all the carrier crews called their ships ""fighting ladies"". He swears Yorktown crew started the nickname. What was really special is during a chapter when Robert Taylor is talking about sailors who leave their routine jobs and go to their battle stations, and it was chilling because one of a half dozen mentioned is my Uncle Leo, whose profile in flak jacket and helmet appears against a setting/rising sun, and says ""Leo the baker scowers the skies for enemy aircraft"". Out of 20K or so men on carriers, to see a close-up of my uncle made it all worth it.

Most of the video is quality for the time. Good pace, decent action, with the human and emotional side of combat. I am a veteran of Iraq, so I can say first hand, this film would be appreciated greatly by most WWII navy vets and their offspring.",1356307200,,1103,4.354368932038835

Ever wondered what it would be like coming back to your floating, rather small, island, with half your airplane missing?. Sheer guts abound in this account of life aboard, and aloft from, a typical American fleet carrier. The heroism of the deck crew in throwing caution to the wind to extricate a pilot from his damaged machine, coupled with the sheer courage of pilots approaching a small deck at high speed in the middle of a rather large ocean, is always going to offer something worthwhile watching. For modellers of WW11 US Navy airplanes this is going to be worthwhile too. Enjoy.",1348704000,,654,4.745614035087719

4429754,4,B004MCPUWU,"For anyone even slightly interested in World War II flight, the war in the Pacific or aircraft carriers, this is a great disk, especially for the price. It's a documentary created in 1944 aboard the USS Yorktown (CV-10). The boat remains unnamed in the film because of security at the time but it's a detailed view of life on a carrier for the average sailor. The first part of the film deals with everyday life on ship and the second part deals with combat flights and carrier operations. The footage is clear (except for some of the shots taken from moving planes executing actual dive bombing runs or in aerial combat. There's a lot of this. It's very interesting),shot in Technicolor, and well edited to tell the story clearly. The narration is by LT Robert Taylor USNR and is also clear and well done, though a product of its time of course. Overall, a very well done, fascinating look at what it was like to be a member of a flattop crew in the Pacific in WWII, including sorties in a two-day raid on Truk and participation in the famous Marianas Turkey Shoot.",1338681600,2,1066,4.528497409326425

4429766,1,B004MCPUWU,"I first saw ""The Fighting Lady"" in Karachi on a layover.  It was presented in Pashtun, with Belgian subtitles.  I couldn't understand any of it, but I really liked looking at Hillary Swank hitting the punching bag.  If I could read lips, I'd have understood it, but my eyes watered and I got a headache.  So when the last of my air-popped millet kernels were eaten, I was out of there!  When I saw that ""The Fighting Lady"" was available on Amazon, I immediately ordered it (fast delivery) and told all the people in my group we would have a dinner party (vegetarian enchiladas) and watch the show.  I was careful not to select the Belgian subtitles.  Imagine my embarrassment when I found it was a film about World War Two aircraft carriers!  This was very false advertising.  I had already seen this aircraft carrier movie years ago in Jakarta, it was presented in Tagalog with Belgian subtitles.  I will admit that watching it in English I understood it much better, and Admiral Mitcher somewhat resembles Hillary Swank, so not a complete loss.  But if you are wanting to see Hillary Swank getting hit in the face, this is not the movie for you.",1334620800,2,1147,4.573529411764706

4429768,4,B004MCPUWU,"The Fighting Lady/Thunderbolt (Remastered) (2011) DVD by PD Productions has very poor picture quality. The print looks as if it has not been cleaned or corrected at all. The documentaries themselves are excellent and have some amazing WWII footage in them, but I was disappointed that the picture quality was so aweful, when it appears other companies (Zeno's Flight Shop Videos) have corrected the color and picture to result in better copies of these historic documentaries. The audio seemed pretty good, although on The Fighting Lady it had to be turned up way louder than usual to get it to a normal level.

So, I recommend both of these documentaries, especially 'The Fighting Lady' for it's excellent aircraft carrier, F4U Corsair, and SB2C Helldiver footage, but do not buy it from PD Productions, buy a copy with better picture quality elsewhere.",1333843200,,854,5.056737588652482
4429769,2,B004MCPUWU,This was presented as a war movie with Robert Taylor. It was a documentry and not a very good one. Unless you like documentries I would not give a thumbs up.,1333843200,,157,4.096774193548387
4429770,5,B004MCPUWU,"This excellent documentary was produced for war time PROPAGANDA purposes in 1943 and 1944 by the services of communication of US Navy and therefore it has all the limitations of this kind of films. It is however a precious document capturing well a great deal of the atmosphere of life on board of an American aircaft-carrier during WWII in Pacific and also showing lots of most interesting REAL fight footage - and all of this in color! It is also very skillfully done. The narration is of course quite jingoistic, but I believe it reflects quite well the general mood prevailing amongst American fighting men (and women) and the general public during the war.

In this film the real name of the aircraft-carrier is never revealed, in order to not give this kind of information to the enemy - the ship is always just called ""The Fighting Lady"". But in fact, the carrier on which we travel, was the USS ""Yorktown"" (CV-10), the second ship in the famous ""Essex"" class (which counted no less than 26 units!). ""Essex"" class carriers were the ones which between 1943 and 1945 allowed the US Navy to comprehensively defeat Imperial Japanese Navy and bring US forces from Southern and Eastern Pacific to the immediate proximity of Japanese home islands. The ""Fighting Lady"" was the second carrier to bear this name - the first ""Yorktown"" was sunk at Midway.

The second USS ""Yorktown"" had a very busy war and it is well shown in this documentary, which covers the period from August 1943 to June 1944. During this time we can see the real war footage from the following battles:

- raid against Marcus Island (August 1943)
- invasion of Kwajalein (January 1944)
- the massive raid on Truk, known as operation ""Hailstone"" (February 1944)
- the battle of Philippine Sea, the greatest carriers battle in history, also known as ""The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"" (June 19-20, 1944)

This is only the selection of battles in which USS ""Yorktown"" participated during this time. Minor actions are not mentioned, but what we see is plenty enough.

The narrator is Hollywood actor Robert Taylor, known amongst others for ""Quo Vadis"" and ""Knights of round table"". The music was composed specially for this film and it is so good, that it was since used in many war movies in the 40s and 50s.

The film is very well done and very interesting - and the end is extremely moving, but I will not reveal more. Once again, this is PROPAGANDA - but gosh, this is propaganda on the highest possible level! Small wonder, that ""The Fighting Lady"" got the Oscar for best documentary in 1944. Hollywood produced between 1941 and 1945 hundreds of propaganda films and documentaries, but this is probably THE BEST!

There are two more reasons for which I found this documentary interesting and moving:

- first, after June 1944, USS ""Yorktown"" fought many more battles and some pilots and air crew members we get to know during this film didn't survive the war...
- second, the ""Fighting Lady"" still exists. USS ""Yorktown"" remained in service for a long time and even took part in Vietnam War. And since 1975, returned more or less to her WWII aspect, she is a museum-ship, anchored at Mount Pleasant in South Carolina.

To conclude, I recommend warmly this interesting propaganda movie, for anybody interested in WWII, the naval history, Hollywood history or propaganda/communication history. I bought the DVD and I am very happy I did it, but if you just want to watch it without buying, if you search well on the internet, it is possible to find this film and see it free of charge, although the quality is not exactly great. On the big screen of the TV it looks better and buying the DVD is therefore more interesting.",1333324800,10,3690,4.735202492211838
4429771,5,B004MCPUWU,"I was only 8 but I remember.  My Dad had the day off from his war job building Curtis-Wright engines for B17's.  We watched a serial and News of the Day but then there was the announcement that the government had said that the film of The Fighting Lady could not be shown.  It never was shown in our theater.  The reason was said to be because the real ""Fighting Lady"" had been sunk by the Japanese.  I don't know if that was true but I know it was possible.  It was a time when we were sustaining losses of many of our ships in the Pacific.
  In this century, the battles of WW2 seem romantic to those too young to have experienced it ...............but those men were brothers, uncles, husbands, boyfriends, fathers.  There was nothing romantic about it.  Those were brave men who faced death with great courage. Too many of them did not survive and many of those who did bore wounds that haunted the rest of their lives. They were, indeed, the greatest generation.

In addition, I did learn about carriers from that period as well as battle tactics. So although I was disappointed in it not being an action film, there were some good takeaways.

Further, the VHS tape has a nice addendum that tells more of the story.

8435934,5,B004MCPUWU,"One of the odder pieces of misinformation is that William Wyler directed THE FIGHTING LADY. In fact, he had no connection with the film whatsoever. While famed photographer Edward Steichen, who did direct the film, and his team of photographers were working on the film footage that went into the making of this documentary, William Wyler was in Europe. Wyler was not in the Navy, but in the US Army and he worked exclusively in Europe under the command of Frank Capra. Wyler was responsible for a significant amount of WW II documentary film making, making one of the most famous documentaries of WW II, MEMPHIS BELLE, and having engaged in most of the principle photography that went into the documentary on a P-47 squadron based in Corsica, THUNDERBOLT. While making the latter he did major damage to his ears while flying in a B-25 without wearing anything to muffle the sound. He was immediately discharged from the army. But he did not magically become involved in a US Navy project. No one seems to know precisely where the error that Wyler directed this film started. Some claim that the error originated in Halliwell's film guides, but no one knows how or why Halliwell began ascribing the film to Wyler rather than Steichen. It isn't as if Steichen needed the fame. Along with his friend and sometimes business partner Alfred Stieglitz, Steichen did as much as anyone to establish photography as an art form and the two remain perhaps the two most important photographers in American history. But credit for the making of this film goes to Edward Steichen and not William Wyler

he more WW II footage that you've seen, the more impressive this W.W II documentary is. The amount of original, fascinating, high quality film footage is astonishing - a staggering amount of the most famous WW II carrier footage first appeared in this film in color, later processed into B&W for use on TV shows on WW II. The timeline has been obscured for whatever reasons demanded by the navy, but the ship is the U.S.S. Yorktown (the Essex class CV-10, not the earlier CV-5, which was the lead ship in a class that also included the legendary carriers Enterprise and Hornet, though some footage is from other ships, in particular the Ticonderoga. You can identify planes from the Yorktown by the diagonal white stripe on the tail of the plane. But Jocko Clark was the captain of the Yorktown, while Smokey Stover, a pilot singled out near the beginning of the film, was a bunkmate of one of the team of photographers working under Steichen (though much of the footage was taken by Steichen himself). Stover, who serves in operations in the first mission in the film, later returns to flying and tragically died in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The admiral they take on early on was the greatest of America's carrier admirals, Mark Mitscher.

My favorite parts of the film are the shots below deck showing some of the places and activities you don't usually see in films wet in WW II. For instance, I just saw THE WAR LOVERS, about an American B-17 bomber squadron in England, and even thought it starred a youngish Steve McQueen and Robert Wagner, they seemed old in comparison to the kids we see on the Yorktown in THE FIGHTING LADY (btw, while THE WAR LOVERS is not a great movie, it is a sheer delight to see a film involving a host of B-17s). We see lots of war films with actors in their mid-twenties playing sailors in WW II films, but we see in this documentary precisely how young the crew was. These were a bunch of kids. Think of Jocko Clark as a veteran high school football coach and the pilots and bulk of the crew as high school players. It really brings home just out inexperienced these kids were and how the Allied victory was purchased by sacrificing the futures of vast numbers of kids who were in their teens or early twenties. Even Smokey Stover, mentioned above, who was a veteran of Guadalcanal, was only 24 when he died. At any rate, if you are interested at all in the Pacific War in WW II, this is absolutely essential.

Just a side comment, I am not a hardcore modeler, but I do enjoy making the occasional scale model WW II plane. I recently put together a Hellcat model and I was astonished, looking closely at the planes in this film, at how stressed and worn the actual planes looked in comparison with my own models. I actually tried to stress and abuse my plane a bit, but even so mine resembled more a plane that was fresh off the assembly line than a combat aircraft. So if you are a modeler, just remember that if you are stressing your plane, always feel free to go a bit crazy.

NOTE:  I just learned that one of my closest friend's fathers was on the USS Yorktown after the submarine he had previously been serving on sank (he was removed from the crew due to a bad case of bronchitis so that he wouldn't pose a health risk to the rest of the crew). I'm trying to find out if he was actually on the Yorktown while this was being filmed. Seems very likely.",1487548800,,4990,4.546162402669633

8435941,3,B004MCPUWU,"From the get-go, one has to remember that this is a war time propaganda film.  Therefore the narration is ""government"" approved, many of the life-aboard scenes are staged for filming and the described timelines do not match-up with the film images.  Case in point, the first raid in the movie is supposed to be of Marcus island.  However, at the beginning of the film it shows SB2C Helldivers landing aboard the carrier.  SB2C's did not enter service until November of '43 and they first saw combat aboard the USS Essex at Rabaul.  And the national insignia on the TBF's and SBC2's are the later style white and blue bars of the 1944.  In '43 U.S. aircraft still had the red outline around the insignia.  The voice overs do not match the character images.  Take for instance ""Jacko"" the so-called ship's captain as he explains how to line-up the aircraft at the start of the film.  Furthermore, in actuality the ship's captain wouldn't be concerned about the air group.  That's the Air Boss' or Air Group commander's function.  His concern lies solely with the ship.  Suffice to say, the film is rife with inaccuracies simple because it was as I said, a propaganda film for the folks back home.

That being said the movie still is a wonderful time capsule.  The aerial footage is in color and rare indeed.  I truly did enjoy seeing moving images of the naval aircraft instead of the usual black and white stills.  What I ended up doing is turning down the sound so as not to be distracting by the inane narration and just enjoying the visual images.

As for the identity of the ""Fighting Lady"" I originally thought that it was the USS Essex.  The F6F Hellcat in-flight towards it's carrier at the beginning of the film was Air Group Commander Flatley's F6F-3 from the Essex.  But as I got into the film it was obvious that the ""Fighting Lady"" was more than one carrier.  The radar suites changed from image to image.  So to did the camouflage schemes and on-board aircraft markings.  Like I said, ignore the audio and just enjoy the various film images.  It's a collection of many different scenes from the mid-war in the Pacific.",1445299200,4,2130,4.621333333333333
