8188752,3,B000P3XEBY,"I grew up with Burl Ives music.  My parents had a lot of his albums.  I probably think of him first in Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer.  But is music has stuck with all these years..  This is a live show of his  Hm and just his guitar.  It's kind of short.  Only nine songs.  And no Big Rock Candy Mountain.  He does Funny Way Of Laughing and I Know An Old Lady,  Which I love.  This music is timeless.",1500508800,,401,3.8875
