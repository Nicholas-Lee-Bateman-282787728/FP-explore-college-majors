3916462,1,B002EAYEC4,"This movie has always served as an example of movies I really didn't like.  Saw it at a drive-in, back in the day.  Midway through it, I was fidgeting, squirming, looking at my watch.  I have no interest in Rachel's life problems or internal conflicts.  I don't know why anyone would care to know about them.",1344729600,2,308,4.446428571428571
3916463,5,B002EAYEC4,"this movie is my mothers all time favorite, she loves it and watches it often ive seen it and its great",1323907200,,103,3.9523809523809526
3916464,5,B002EAYEC4,"This film was never meant for public consumption. At the time it was made, the [now very familiar] actors were relatively unknowns. I'm glad to see it has made it to DVD, but I'll wait for the price to come down.",1301529600,2,212,4.195121951219512
3916465,4,B002EAYEC4,"I have heard this is a great film, and would love to buy this and Bhowani Junction too. May I mention Beau Brummel as well, which I loved so much years ago. But the policy of the studio now is to charge the earth, and just look at this and you will see why I will not be buying these products at these prices (and I have over 1500 DVDs and VHS legitimately purchased). Would you buy this, under these circumstances?

3916466,4,B002EAYEC4,"I saw this on TCM the other night.  It didn't seem like something i would stay up to watch but at 2:30am, i was lamenting the end of the show!  I think it really hits home with many people - we all preach to others about what is right and wrong but do we live it?  It's clear that Rachel loves the people of the Congo, and is concerned for their souls.  And yet, the loneliness of being different and having no one there from her world to help her makes her vulnerable to the charms of the young doctor.  She's torn between the reality of life and by her own moral standards and finds out, in the end, who she really is.  i loved it! (and i'm not even an angie dickinson fan, but she is great in this flick!)",1281312000,9,708,3.9858156028368796
3916467,5,B002EAYEC4,I ordered this not knowing what to expect because I had never seen the movie. My son saw it on Turner Classic Movies so I surprised him with it as a gift. After the price dropped I decided to purchase it for myself. This is a very good movie with a young Angie Dickinson. The quality of the DVD was excellent.,1410480000,2,309,4.081967213114754

3916470,5,B002EAYEC4,"I saw part of this film on Turner Classic Movies and I decided to purchase it so I could see the whole thing. I am glad I did. I really like this movie because, as a Christian I can really appreciate the story. I showed it to my son and he also liked it a lot. It's a type of a movie that you can see it more than one time.",1399939200,2,323,3.563380281690141
3916471,5,B002EAYEC4,I named my daughter after this movie.  It's dated now but it was perfect for its time.  Good acting and I was sruck between Rachel and Sarah.  This tipped the scales.  Bought this so she could see it.,1389225600,2,200,4.184210526315789
3916472,5,B002EAYEC4,"Love the old movies. Angie Dickinson did a commendable job as a missionary torn between upholding her moral beliefs vs. her physical cravings. I saw this movie once on television years ago and was determined to get it, but could never find it. I'm so glad that you offered it. I definitely recommend it.",1388275200,,303,4.62962962962963

3916474,5,B002EAYEC4,"This is going to sound cheesy, but I bought this video because I am going through a difficult time in my life.  I remembered seeing this movie when I was younger.  I like the story line--it encourages me.  It is a movie of endearment and the courage of a young woman in an unimagineable situation.  I think you will like it.",1377475200,6,324,4.262295081967213

3916476,4,B002EAYEC4,"Enjoyable movie, good story line involving some very interesting character assessments. The actors were excellent with the exception of Roger Moore who was completely miss cast. Angie Dickinson and Peter Finch do a first class job, in fact this is one the best performances I've seen from Angie Dickinson, totally believeable. This is a movie that will appeal to wide cross section of people who enjoy romantic adventure stories. Definitely worth a watch.",1357430400,3,455,5.2465753424657535

8367103,4,B002EAYEC4,This movie shows there is imperfection in everyone but God's grace keeps on a good path if we don't get caught up in guilt. As we confront our failures we become stronger and can move on in our God given purpose. Repentence and humility are the key factors in this movie,1475452800,,270,4.313725490196078
