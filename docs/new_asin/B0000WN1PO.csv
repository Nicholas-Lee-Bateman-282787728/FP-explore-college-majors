1957694,1,B0000WN1PO,"Society has taken over skateboarding, and this ""film"" proves it. This is the nail in the coffin for this great art form that was once called skateboarding... And I thought jackass was putting skateboarding into overdrive, just look at this sponsor-heavy cameo ridden piece of junk. Whoever took part in this film who is a pro skater I can't help but shake my head at, saying look at what you've done. I went into the theater and right away, I figured out this wasn't my movie I was hoping for (not like I was expecting much from a bunch of pseudo-wannabe teen actors). I was hoping for a thrashin' clone but of a newer take but I got slapped in the face and kicked in the head by terrible acting, ignorant humor (just because we skate doesn't mean we're dumb), pathetic cameos and dialogue. But the last thing is it's so sponsor heavy that I started laughing. C'mon  people let skateboarding cool off for once. I don't believe in this X-Treme image it has been given. Sorry but I'm going to go snap my board, sell my skate videos and stop because of this. This, this movie is just beyond the limits for any older skater whose been skating since the 1980's.
Please kids learn about the history before you kill it.",1067644800,2,1212,4.45945945945946
1957695,1,B0000WN1PO,"I don't think it's humanly possible to name everything wrong wth this movie in under 1,000 qords, but here's the WORST parts:
-Poor Acting :
A bunch of no-name actors that have no enthusiasm and sound like they're reading lines, if that sounds good to you then go sit in the middle of the road. Dis-Honorable Mention includes the guy from Rat Race (He acted better in that movie when he barely ever talked), and the kid from the OC, who sounds like an OVER-OVER-ENTHUSASTIC Jason Biggs.
-No plot :
I never really understood what the premise was. One day, the protagonist decides to take his friend's van and go get famous and sponsored. Then, he tries to get his own company going, then he tries to win a girl over, THEN he tries to get sponsored again. I'm sure the ending was pretty bad, but I can't honestly tell you how bad because I walked out (It didn't matter, I had already figured out how it would end some 30mins before it did, IT'S THAT PREDICATABLE) So I guess the real plot line is : Hey, Skateboarding is popular, so let's make a quick, cheap movie to get millions of dollars off of!
-Celebrity Hype/Ad-fest
There were plenty of famous celebreties scattered across this movie like Bam Margera, Jason ""Weeman"" Acuna, Preston Lacy, Tom Green, and the Swedish band ""Blindside"". But it wouldn't matter how well they acted (And some of them were okay, like Tom Green), because most of them were in the movie for less than 10 minutes.
Director Casey La Scala (Who also did laughably bad, What a Girl wants with Amanda Bynes) must really be rolling in money after THE BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF ADS IN THE MOVIE. Ads for: Birdhouse,Etnies,Toy Machine,Billabong,Adio,Element,Vans,Hook-Ups,Blind,Zero,Baker,Circa,O'Neill,Dakine,Tensor,Krux,Destructo, and many, many more.",1067472000,,1775,4.900332225913621
1957696,1,B0000WN1PO,"To give this movie more than 1 star is to give corporate America your soul. This movie was made because skateboarding is all of the sudden THE thing. The cameos are somewhat cool, but under no circumstances should cameos carry a movie. (...)",1067385600,,241,4.627906976744186
1957697,3,B0000WN1PO,"This movie was straight jacked. I won't even lie, I only went to go see it because Bam Margera was in it, and I thought Ehren from Jackass was going to have something to do with the production of the movie. If you're not a pre-teen or head over heels in love w/ Bam Margera, then this movie is not for you. The stunts and 'funniness' was PREDICTABLE. The 'funny lines' I didn't even find them funny, but the 10 year old sitting next to me seem to crack up and die laughing. The only thing I can say good about this movie, is the appearences, they have a lot of nice special appearences. One would be skater, Mike V., Preston from Jackass, and the Swedish band Blindside. But, if you're looking for a GOOD laugh, buy Haggard or some of the cKy stuff.",1063756800,4,749,4.208333333333333
1957698,4,B0000WN1PO,"I liked this movie. Surprising enough, nobody eles really liked this movie, yet along saw this movie. I can't understand why nobody saw it either. It was released in alot of theatres, there was a few familar faces, and it was a movie with alot of teen appeal. Of course all of the teen appeal was probally sneaking into Freddy vs Jason to even consider watching this.
The trailer made it look bad. For once, all of the funny parts were not in the trailer because all of the parts there made this look like a horrible movie. The movie was funny, it had alot of laugh out loud moments, and even intense scenes where you root for the heros. It's a film with a topic that I don't think I've ever considered doing and that's skateboarding. I've known people who do it all the time, but I never really got into that sort of thing.
The skateboard group in this movie consist of Eric Rivers, Dustin, and Matt. They all want to be professionals but can't get professionals like Jimmy Wilson to watch thier demo tape. That is untill Eric gets the idea to follow a national skateboard tour to try and convince Wilson to watch the tape. Of course, all of them carless, they need help from an older friend by the name Sweet Lou. Lou still hits on high school girls and whoever he sets his sights on he gets. He goes with them along with his van.
The trip around the country does not fair easy. Along the way they sneak into Jimmy's truck, the van gets stolen, and Eric falls in love with fellow skateboarder Jamie, who they meet on the road. The guys try to prove to that their skills in skateboarder are worth to be seen by the public, and by their idols.
Grind is not just another teen movie. Most of the cast may seem like bad role models. Sweet Lou with his constant hitting on girls, Matt with his constant sexist jokes towards women. Good models can be Dustin who is the smart one in the group, wants to get into a good collage and works hard for his money. But in the end they all change for the better because on the trip something happens to them that makes them better friends and better people.
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for crude humor, sexual content and language.",1062374400,2,2157,4.328395061728395

1957739,5,B0000WN1PO,"Grind is a great movie and a time stamp of the early 2000s. Great casting, all of the guys are hilarious and good actors. Just like American Pie I'd love to hang with these guys, they are great buddies. It's a great mix of skateboarding, awesome rock music and hilarious ""frat boy"" humor. I get a little sad watching it, those were great days, a more innocent and laid back time. Really takes me back.

Actors Mike Vogel and Adam Brody became big actors. Vince Vieluf is HILARIOUS and stole the movie, as he did in Rat Race movie. He's the standout like Stifler in AP. But the actors are great and all compliment each other.

I saw Grind on cable years ago and loved it right away and it's still great to this day. I'm glad to finally own and in a few weeks I have already watched it twice. Once in regular, another in commentary. Watching it with commentary was great, all of the guys (except with just one I believe) reminisce and tell secrets/things behind the scenes.

I enjoyed seeing some of the pro cameos skating at the various events, although the movie kept the tricks pretty 'safe' to cut the expense of shooting and production, I'm sure. The skating was so-so.

1957841,4,B0000WN1PO,"Five or some years ago, I declared that this movie would suck and as far as I was concerned, it did. I hadn't watched a sport related film since ""Airborn"" (with my second eldest brother), the Disney Channel Original Movie, ""Brink!"", and ""The Lords of Dogtown"" last year. None of them were my favorite movies, but my siblings favorites, though I enjoyed them all the same during the times I watched them. So when I ""dared to be stupid"" and decided to watch ""Grind"", I expected to be doing a lot of face palming and just enjoying the scenery that was the then-newcomer, Mike Vogel. But to my surprise this film manages to excel above the corniness or heavy melodrama that occupies the aforementioned films.

Eric Rivers (Mike Vogel), who has recently graduated high school, aspires to become a professional skateboarder -- up there with the likes of Jimmy Wilson, his idol. But with no one willing to sponsor him or his friends, this dream is as close to coming true as his prospects of escaping work with his father in a Hardware store. However, he hardly allows this to deter him and one day he proposes the idea of following Jimmy Wilson's tour across the country to his friends Dustin Knight (Adam Brody) and Matt Jensen (Vince Vieluf). At first, they are apprehensive as they're perfectly comfortable in their current niches and Dustin is determined to work his overtime to pay his way to collage. However, with a little more convincing Eric manages to recruit them and the eldest of his friends, Sweet Lou Singer (Joey Kern) who decides to join them after a learning one of his ""high-school sweethearts"" tells her father about him. Once on the road, the ""Super Duper Skates"" run into more problems and failures than successes and begin wonder if their road trip was such a good idea after all.

Grind is an adventure/comedy in its simplest form; the idea of watching four teenage boys (or three, excluding Sweet Lou) ride around in a rusty old van chasing a skateboarder's tour bus, hardly sounds like a interesting way to spend your hour, at first. But watching the concept in motion was actually pretty fun. The actors do really great jobs of bringing the personalities of their assigned characters to life. They don't fall into a random stereotype that one could peg very easily. Granted, there's a clown in the form of Vieluf's Matt, a dreamer in Vogel's Eric, the academic in Brody's Dustin, and the stoner-esque slacker in Kern's Lou, but they all manage to become more than their suspected labels.

I think my favorite character besides Eric Rivers, was Sweet Lou Singer. The writer must've watched ""Dazed and Confused"", because Sweet Lou emulates a lot of what I saw in Matthew McConaughey in the aforementioned film. The only thing that was missing was the drug element. One negative in relation to characters that seemed forgetful and rather needless in the grand scheme of things (until that one moment), was Jennifer Morrison as Jamie. Morrison makes small appearances throughout the film, and somehow serves a love-interest for Eric Rivers, yet her character hardly has any interaction with the characters until the end of the movie. Her sudden romantic relationship with Mike Vogel's character was simply unbelievable. Literally.

A lot of the time the humor in the film is crude and flat out gross, just like something a gaggle of boys would find amusing, but it never falls flat and actually made me laugh out loud. The only negatives of this film that I can think of, is that the ""story"" is easily forgotten as you get swept up in watching the skate boarding sequences, or just watching the four young men get their asses handed to them time and again whilst out in the wide blue countryside. I got so caught up in their road-trip I tended to forget where they were headed.

Also, my knowledge on the skateboarding sport beyond just riding a board and not falling down is very limited. To add onto that, I didn't know any of the names of mentioned in this film, so beyond the actor cameos, the famous skaters were something I never noticed. Everyone that wasn't one of the main characters were just extras in the background to me. The soundtrack is compiled of music that was pretty popular back in 2003 or 2000, featuring the likes of Shinedown, Trapt, and Billy Talent among others. However, there is one moment of ""score"" during a scene shared between Matt and his enstranged family, which made me roll my eyes in embarssment. Thankfully it stops as abruptly as it began.

The overall acting in this movie was excellent; I really don't expect anything above average or mediocre in terms of acting when it comes to movies like this. But the acting was really good, to repeat myself. The then-newcomer Mike Vogel performed nicely in his role and was flat out adorable to boot. Adam Brody (an actor I tend to get confused with Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks. Don't ask) as the sensible Dustin Knight creates a likeable nerd character that isn't an overbearing on the moral compass when concerned with acedemics and his future. Vince Vieluf pretty much plays the same wackey character he played in Rat Race without the strange speech pattern and dumb-giant personality. Joey Kern's performance as Sweet Lou was probably the most interesting; He played it with such ease, it was hard not to buy this character. Overall, Grind is a really entertaining movie. Its nothing innovative, but you just have a good time watching it. --- [a 4 out of 5]",1214870400,3,5459,4.747102212855638

Childish? Yes. Stupid? Yes. Hilarious? Yes.

Grind is funny and charming. Any kid who's just finished high school can relate to the spirit of this film. It follows four skateboarding boys in their quest to get sponsored.

If I didn't know anything about skateboarding, I might find the whole skateboard culture thing a little obnoxious, but the guys are likeable enough, even if their characters are a little flat and predictable (the dying-to-get-signed skater, the clown - who is awesome, the reluctant tagalong and the womanizer) and the challenges of the road plus their solutions are amusing enough.

In terms of the skateboarding, there are some nice sequences and the cinematography of those beats most skater pron. I dug the skating and wished there was more. There just wasn't enough. My favorite sequence was the hotel pool - that was awesome. But the ramp riding at the end was incredible and the way it was filmed was first rate.

Do I recommend it? Depends. If you're looking for a new take on the teen genre, this isn't it. If you're looking for the ultimate skater movie, this isn't it either (it doesn't yet exist).

None of the people in this movie were comedians(Tom Green doesn't count). There are so many things I hate about this movie it's not even funny, but I'll start listing them right away. There is the horribly unrealistic plot. Four worthless people decide they want to get sponsered so they go on a pointless journey to catch some famous skateboarder. Of course, they have alot of mishaps during their trip, and none of these incidents are funny. Of course, at the end of the movie, they get sponsered and become famous! WOW! NOW YOU'RE FAMOUS SKATEBOARDERS! WONDERFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT!

There is also the cameo appearances that is used to drag in viewers(Very poor tactic). Good thing none of these cameo appearances were from respectable people! The film also portrays women as ""make-out machines"" and decieving beings who only want to take things from you. The scenes don't seem to tie in very well either. The music is from talentless bands(which includes POISON!).

I personally don't find skateboarding very appealing, but I know that skateboarders aren't like the idiots in the movie. As far as I know, skateboarding is just a hobby and not something you should make money off of. I don't know what all this commercialized skateboarding stuff is, but I know this is not what skateboarding is really about. Do yourself a favor and skip this sorry excuse of a comedy.

The transitions between the actors skating and their professional skater stunt-doubles could not be clearer.

This is just a funny teen movie, the kind that leave you laughing.

It is a cult classic and it has its following but many will not like it because although it has a plot (to get to skate in a completion)  it is not a bold face one.  On their way to get to their dream they encounter many hilarious moments.  This movie is heavily plotted around skateboarding and if you are not a fan you probably will not like this movie.  It is also is moved along with its music which gets you in the mood for skateboarding.

Most people who watch this for the Adam Brody they see on The O.C will get the same humor but probably will not like this movie...so watch this movie if you like skateboarding...that is my opinion-otherwise if you are looking for a plot that is real in-depth don't look for this movie!",1107820800,2,845,4.147239263803681

This movie stars one of the guy from the O.C. and three other twits who are skaters looking for a sponsor. The movie is so badly edited that many scenes make zero sense.  The shot of one of the skaters riding down the street on a toilet that was in the previews is in the movie.  I always wondered whyhe was doing this whenever I saw the grind preview, but in the film no explanation is given, it's just spliced in with a bunch of other random scenes. The dialogue is atrocious, as well. As a result, the plot is impossible to follow at times.

This movie was obviously written and made by middle aged dweebs who have no idea how young people actually act or talk.  This is a movie that is merely trying to cash in on the lame and trendy skateboard scene.  The only teen movie worse than this is Cheats.",1101340800,,1023,4.274611398963731

The whole premise to this movie is ridiculous and totally predictable.  Some kid wants to get sponsored, become professinal, and become a celebrity.  Big Surprise.  I'm sorry but every skater in this movie has totally turned their back on what skateboardings about. Even if it seems like they would never do so, i'm sorry but they have.  Skateboarding is not mtv, movies, espn , skaterade or anything that has been throw at the masses to make a buck.  Even the non-skateboarding stuff, like the humor, is lame. Hey kiddies don't be fooled by this, you're better than that.  These people are humans just like you and I. No better. Remember, skateboarding is just you and your board, nothing more. Not a t-shirt, magazine, label, video game, any pro-skater, tv show or movie.  Think about it and have a fun time skating with your friends.",1098057600,,950,4.7439024390243905

The humor is awesome, but not if you're looking for particularly intelligent comedy.  All in all, it's a funny movie, if you're simple (such as myself) and get easily amused by nifty skate tricks, this is for you.  The guys aren't genius material, nor is it a movie to live by, but if your alternative is not particularly exciting, I'd definately say check out Grind.

1957878,4,B0000WN1PO,"this movie is funny (at times hillarious) in a crude, ""dude"" type of way, but not at all in a mean spirited or overly offensve way. It's a sports/road trip movie with some nods to MTV Jackass and skating, but does have some positive qualities, mostly the underlying themes which are ""commentaries"" on the world according to guys.
..a few lessons on how to meet girls, how to have friends, keeping a sense of humor, sticking with your freinds, and how to stay focused on your goals, even when you literally smell like dookie. Has some commentary about how many guys feel-even if you have great talent, you'll feel like you're ignored by society until that miraculous day when you're ""sponsored"" and suddenly respected by everyone for the talent you've had all along
-I think every guy can relate to this theme, whether a 18 year old skater or a 30 year old office worker-
This is a movie, in some ways, about being a guy
Despite the bathroom humor here and there, I still recommend this movie for the positive underlying themes and the skate scenes, which are cool",1080518400,,1063,4.6

The movies cast is great with Vince Vieluf and Adam Brody they all fit together.... Many of the scenes are great with real tricks like when they skate the parking lot it gets you pumped and wanting to go outside and skate.
