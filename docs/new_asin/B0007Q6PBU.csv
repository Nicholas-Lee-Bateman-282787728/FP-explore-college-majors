2230980,4,B0007Q6PBU,"This performance should be titled: ""The Story of the Sea Captain Who Sells his Daughter.""

Matti Salminen, who plays Daland, captures the audience's attention whenever he is on stage.  At six feet five inches, he looms over everyone else in the cast and outsings everyone, including the mighty black baritone Simon Estes, who plays the title role.  Estes sounds very powerful and deep when he sings alone and also during his duet with Senta, but when he duets with Salminen in the first act, he sounds weak and dry by comparison with Salminen's huge, penetrating bass.

Salminen once remarked in an interview that Daland could be portrayed as ""Hagar the Horrible"" or as ""Mr. Nice-Guy"".  In this performance Salminen chooses Option One, making his Daland arrogant, greedy, and bullying, glaring at Senta as he introduces her to her new suitor, as if daring her to contradict him during his aria ""Mogst du, mein kind.""  (There's another videotaped performance of DUTCHMAN which also features Salminen, with Hildegard Behrens and Franz Grundheber, in which Salminen chooses Option Two, portraying Daland as a mellow sweetheart with his daughter's best interests at heart.  But that's a different performance.)

So watch this video twice: once to take it in and be blown away by Salminen, and a second time in which you must conscientiously transfer your attention to the other singers, who are well worth watching and hearing.  The chorus in particular is well-disciplined and striking.",1219881600,3,1483,5.1203319502074685

2230982,4,B0007Q6PBU,"I have never seen nor heard a Wagnerian opera before and was intimidated, but wanted to try.  Dutchman was his shortest opera and most ""traditional"" so I thought it would be a good introduction for me.
I believe that I was correct.  I enjoyed this opera a great deal, perhaps even more than I expected to.
My main complaint for this opera is Senta.  The woman who sang her role looked crazy the entire time, like a patient escaped from a mental hospital.  Perhaps that was the intent, but it detracted from my enjoyment.  It was not making the whole thing her dream that bothered me but the deranged look she had on her face the entire time and her spasmodic movements.
The rest of the cast was good though it was odd to see a black man repeatedly referred to as pale. {For what it's worth, for all the white Aida's who've worn make-up to look black, why couldn't Estes have worn make-up to look ""pale""?}
For me, this opera met its objectives.  I have heard a Wagnerian opera and enjoyed it.  I am looking forward to broadening my listening horizons further.  A few years from now I may even be ready to listen to the Ring!",1197417600,4,1123,4.365384615384615
2230983,1,B0007Q6PBU,"Edited to say: I'm changing my mind - I watched it again, and liked it a little better. To be fair, I have to be grateful this dvd exists, it documents an important performance, and this Harry Kupfer staging seems to be an important moment  in the development of the whole ""Regietheater"" thing.

It is an interesting premise to make the whole story the fantasy of a sick mind, however, as Peter Konwitchny points out, in an interview about his own different (also Regietheater) staging of the opera for Munich -- to put the whole story in the mind of Senta -- belittles the real human tragedy - the struggle to love and trust, the failure to trust....

So, I am glad this video exists, and glad I watched it, but in final analysis, well, I was not in love with the staging, no, and not really in  love with the singers -- they did fine jobs, but and am eager to get my hands on the video with Flying Dutchman from the Vienna Staatsoper with Nina Stemme and Falk Struckman to make up for it.",1189468800,10,990,4.306451612903226
2230984,3,B0007Q6PBU,"there are so many ups to this performance, it is an almost entire success. Despite some reviewers esteem of Lisbeth Balslev(she resembles the mom from SIX FEET UNDER-VOICE AND ALL), she almost ruins the whole opera with her irritating acting throughout--it is impossible to ignore and until you figure out what the ?*&*% is going on, you, or at least I, was screaming at the TV bemoaning her over the top wriggling and personification of the beat. Example-in the overture- she personifies the beat-thrusting her head to the left shoulder and then to the right with each phrases climax-and I had no idea what the ***was going on till I stopped the video and looked up a review and its perverse mutation was explained to me. I am not going to explain it here, though I should, but I want you to see it with my eyes to undersand what I went through.  IF there is a better one out there, I would recommend that just because of her performance-her voice is initially weak but tends to gather strength as she goes on-till at the end she becomese a powerhouse. The other characters-including our modern MIMI(g. clarke) are exceptioanl-the dutchman in particular is electrifiying and portrays misfortunes well.  Matti Salminen is, as always, strong and noble.

Overall, evverything but SENTA is great, though her acting alone is enough to ruin this.",1159401600,18,1341,4.796536796536796
2230985,5,B0007Q6PBU,"The key to this production is director Harry Kupfer who made this concept of DER FLIEGENDE HOLLAENDER his signature. Kupfer got fascinated by the obsession of Senta by a legendary but not very real person. So, the Dutchman became real in her mind and since a legend of a cursed soul can never end happily, it destructs Senta's weird mind. It is amazing to see how, with the perfection of the technical means of the Bayreuth Festival, this production is able to show this Night Mare with an astounding sense of reality. I have had the priviledge to work in Bayreuth during the making and performing of this master piece. It has not lost any of its unique value, in a performance with the greatest singers of that time, Simon Estes, Matti Salminen, Robert Schunk and Lisbeth Balslev. This recording is 21 years old and has lost nothing of its magic power!",1154822400,16,853,4.618421052631579
2230986,4,B0007Q6PBU,"I would expect better than I received, but then I am a technophile that enjoys getting as close to the experience as possible when I cannot be present physicallly.  I received this DVD with great anticipation, and I cannot fault the music, the production, the staging, et al.  I DO take exception to a product that can give me 5.1 surround sound, and then foist it onto a paltry 4:3 aspect ratio screen size.  If the technology existed for the 5.1 sound, it should have been available for the 16:9 screen.

The purists will fault me for raising a seemingly insignificant detail in an otherwise stellar product, but then, a purist would opt for a live performance over a recorded one.  I would wish for the best of both worlds, which are readily available, but are slow in coming.",1139097600,5,779,4.575539568345324
2230987,5,B0007Q6PBU,"For those of us who couldn't get to Bayreuth to see this much-

discussed production of Der Fliegende Hollander, this DVD pro-

vides an excellent close approximation.

Whatever one may have heard about this ""controversial"" product-

ion, put your opinions aside, and ""enjoy"" a terrifying ride.

From the initial scene of women and girls watching a thunder-

storm outside, and worrying at the same time about their sailor

folk, THIS seems right in and of itself-the older women sit over

a communal teapot, while the girls are watched over by an atten-

tive Mary, who also is keeping an eye on the obsessed Senta.

The concept of having Senta dreaming of a way out, a very drastic, however romantic it may be, of her circumscribed life

as a village dweller, soon to face a humdrum life as a hausfrau

spinning her life away while enduring long waits for her menfolk

is a brilliant concept.  The sight of not one, but TWO Dutchman

figures, one a reality of a bargained marriage, the other of a

dream-obsession figure is chilling, sinister, and one just knows

this will have a bad outcome, once reality clashes with the inner madness-and it does:  Senta dreams of marrying her ideal

dream nightmare figure, and the imagined wedding party is subse-

quently chased off by unseen nightmares.

Erik the hunter comes off as one of the few characters grounded

in reality, and he tries desperately to wake Senta from a disas-

trous obsession.  But she cannot handle the clash of reality be-

tween reality and madness, and faced with the reality of a cir-

cumscribed narrow village life, she jumps out of her window.

What happens next is shocking:  all the villagers turn their backs on the now-dead Senta and grieving Erik, and slam shut their windows-absolutely shocking.

This is the sad reality-when someone could not break free of their desired escape from a dreary life-they retreat into madness.

Going back to Wagner's original orchestration is also a brilliant concept, as one can see how frightening it was to the

1840's audiences.  It IS dark and gloomy, no good can come of it, and it is a frightening piece, as it is meant to be. It is

not a piece of froth, it reeks of the sea, and it's violence.

This is a must-have disc, as it dispells much of the romantic

cliches that have barnacled this opera.",1119830400,63,2321,4.703241895261845
2230988,5,B0007Q6PBU,"The production on this DVD represents the best that Bayreuth, if not opera itself, can be.

Kupfer and his forces attain Wagner's concept of Gesamtkunstwerk. Everything supports Kupfer's idea that the events are a product of Senta's desperate attempt to escape the crushing dullness of her Ibsenesqe reality. Sykora's sets fly up and down, fold in and out, to move from gray confinement to desperate escape. Balslev's voice, face, and body perfectly convey Senta's psychotic state. Mary seems somewhat shady, Eric maintains a constants state of panic, and Daland ends up helpless. The blocking of the chorus alternately represents the disapproval of Senta's peers (in the second act) and the wild product of her imagination (in the third). The choice of the harder Dresden version of the score, especially at the end, suits the ultimate failure to which both the Dutchman and Senta are doomed.

Even the Bayreuth production style - no audience, no images of the conductor and orchestra, no curtain calls - helps to underscore that this is cold reality in spite of a thrilling theatrical performance.

The musical forces meet the high standard set by the production. Salminen, as usual, pours out floods of his richly sonorous, distinctive bass. Estes sings as strong as he looks, while maintaining a smooth legato. Balslev tackles Senta - a role as hard if not as long as Isolde - successfully. Her bottom and top are equally strong and the sound of her voice, strong yet fragile, fits the part. When you have someone the caliber of Graham Clark singing the Steuermann, you know even the smaller parts have been cast with an eye to quality singing. The principle singers had been in this production for seven seasons (ironically, the same amount of time the Dutchman was cursed to sail the seas) by the time the performance was recorded and their experience shows in their execution.

Nelsson presides over a fast, assured reading of the score. Brian Large deserves special mention for his direction of the video. Senta always being on stage (even when Wagner doesn't have here there) must have presented a particular challenge. Large maintains an adroit balance cutting between Senta and the main action, and otherwise stays out of the way.

The video quality is good for 1985; just don't try to zoom in on a scene. The sound is excellent. There are no extras to speak of; the production speaks for itself.

If you care about Wagner, opera, theater, or art, buy this DVD.",1119398400,78,2472,4.916067146282973
2230989,5,B0007Q6PBU,"I own many recordings of the ""Flying Dutchman"" including a CD of this staged performance which has, for sometime, been my very favorite recording of the opera. I really believe that this recording captures Simon Estes at his considerable best.  His singing is overwhelming.  This performance proves that he was a MAJOR talent in the operatic firmament.  How unfortunate it was that he did not always maintain this high level of singing in other portrayals.  I feel that if he had maintained this standard of singing, he would now be considered one of opera's greatest bass-baritones of all times.  Anyway, his singing in this performance captures him at his very best-great intonation, loads of controlled power along with the required introspective soft well-controlled singing-and does he ever have stamina sounding as fresh at the close of the opera as he does at its beginning!  Visually, his portrayal of the Dutchman is very sensual indeed-I can see why Senta was so besotted and loony for him (whether he is real or not!).
Lizbeth Balsev is a wonderful Senta.  She is able to vocally and thrillingly ride the orchestra when required and tone it all down to sing softly when required.  She portrays Senta's mania very well.  She is visually very believable in the role as well as being able to vocally do anything that Wagner throws at her from the full throttled ""blow them off the stage"" type of singing (with no hint of strain) to the most delicate well-controlled soft ""unworldly"" type of singing.  Brava!
The rest of the cast is also great. Salminen is simply awesome-is that voice really coming from a human throat?  Schunk sings the impossible role of Erik wonderfully and powerfully; the best that I've ever heard having no audible problems with its cruel tessitura! (He doesn't crack once as I have heard many other tenors do in this role!)
Nelsson whips the Bayreuth orchestra into an effective ""oceanic wild froth""; it is really exciting to hear!  None of the opera seems to drag as in some of the other recordings that I've heard (e.g., the Levine recording especially).
The chorus is marvelous contributing much excitement to the opera (the tenors in the chorus are a standout being unbelievably good from sweet soft head tones to full bodied stirring high notes)
The score is given (I believe) complete including that marvelously exciting stretta-section after the trio which is usually cut. (Possibly because the singers have worn themselves out with the preceding duet and trio.  Nevertheless, these singers-- almost literally whipped into a frenzy with Balsev popping full throttled high note after high note (while prone and crawling on the floor)--sing it for all its worth bring the scene vocally to a thrilling close; they raise the excitement level to the ""fevered-pitch"" reading on the ""opera excitement measuring machine"" making the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall-WOW!)
The production is rather modern; however, it is comprehensible even to someone as unsophisticated as I.
In spite of a few audible scenery clunks along with footsteps, the sound is great and the picture is crystal clear in this DVD format.  I'm really thrilled to have a visual to go along with my favorite recording of this thrilling masterpiece.",1118620800,54,3255,4.981549815498155

2230997,2,B0007Q6PBU,"The good news - superb singing and conducting/orchestra, as expected from Bayreuth.

The bad news - as also to be expected, seeing as it's Bayreuth - the original (""Dresden"") version of this opera, with its abrupt, rude, even peremptory ending, as opposed to the beautiful ""Redemption"" theme Wagner added later.  Remmeber that captivating raised-fourth ending of the overture you've heard X times?  Well, the opera is supposed to end that way too.  Instead we get all the windows of all the houses slammed shut good and loud, telling us ""that's all folks, like it or lump it.""  Gross.

BTW Bayreuth usually does that with ""Tannhaeuser"" too, depriving us of all the fantastic new music in Act I and to a lesser extent in Acts II and III.

Add to that the usual kitsch pertaining to ""producer opera"" by Harry Kupfer, making parts of this show remind me of the movie ""All That Jazz"" - which I liked BTW but it's not suitable here.  But still - I could probably have lived with Harry's Follies had it been the revised version.

The only other dvd of this I haven't seen, but from the reviews it looks bad.  I don't know why the Met didn't help us out here as it did with ""Tannhauser"", the ""Ring"" , and ""Parsifal"".  (I do prefer the Ponelle ""Tristan"", though).

Anyway - don't buy either set without at least test-driving it via Netflix or whatever.",1277424000,4,1344,4.577405857740586
2230998,5,B0007Q6PBU,"In staging this opera, Harry Kupfer makes a single radical decision that drives the production like a full force gale: he presents the appearance of the Dutchman as Senta's delusion.  She fixes on the romantic legend of a sailor doomed to roam the seas forever until he can be saved by a woman's love in order to escape from the confines of the life she is destined for, and to assuage the pain of her love for a huntsman, Erik, who loves her in return, but whose poverty insures that her father will reject him as a suitable husband.

Kupfer makes this work by having Senta on stage continually from the outset.  Even during the overture she is shown waiting out the storm with her nurse Mary and the women of the village, cradling the portrait of the Dutchman.

Thus an inevitable conflict starts to take shape between Senta's fantasy world and the oppressive realities of her existence.  As it unfolds, we witness something far more like Ibsen than anything previously associated with Wagner.  Yet what is remarkable is how well everything else in the opera conspires with this new view.  For example, the Dutchman's wealth is an essential part of Senta's delusion because it assures her father's consent to the match, thus allowing her to be a good daughter even as she finds romantic fulfillment--something not possible with Erik.

The end of the opera is devastating: tragedy rather than romantic apotheosis. In a traditional production, the Dutchman believes that Senta is unfaithful to him because he sees her with Erik.  But Senta is telling her former lover to leave her.  Does the Dutchman require that she not even talk to other men, or that her fidelity be retroactive?  In Kupfer's production, Erik's reminder that she had previously sworn fidelity to him precipitates a psychological crisis that culminates in her suicide.  At the end, Erik alone remains by Senta's body while the rest of the villagers slam their windows shut.

But concept is by no means this production's only strength.  The staging--in which the walls of Senta's house literally fly away as her imagination takes flight--is brilliantly done.  The Dutchman's ship is wonderfully macabre.  All of the elements of Senta's social world are solidly 19th century Norwegian; unlike many non-traditional stagings, no attempt is made to change or generalize the place and time of the action.

Somehow, the music benefits from the edginess of Kupfer's interpretation.  Musically, this isn't really the Wagner we've come to know through Tristan and the Ring--it's an earlier phase of German opera, like Weber on steroids.  In fact, at the time Dutchman was written, Wagner was championing Bellini.  The long shadow of Senta's dilemma gives the opera greater unity, and adds pathos and weight to the sweeter moments of the score.

Of course, it helps that the music is in remarkably capable hands.  The orchestral direction and playing is magnificent.  The cast is superb, almost a dream cast.  Other reviewers have given high praise to Simon Estes and Matti Salminen, and I fully agree.  Robert Schunk makes the most of his opportunity to portray Erik in a sympathetic light (for once, he's not the fly in the romantic ointment, but the one person who really loves Senta).  Lizbeth Balslev sings superbly and superbly realizes Senta's ""hypersensitive, hysterical"" character, a character she successfully maintains onstage through all 135 minutes of this nonstop opera.

Search through the opera DVDs on Amazon and you'll find scores of productions that attempt to ""re-envision"" an opera.  Many of them don't work.  This one does, and brilliantly.  Even if you generally don't like ""non-traditional"" productions, I encourage you to give this one a try.",1230076800,10,3725,5.029363784665579

This is the first performance of Fliegende Hollander I have seen that is faithful to the almost insane intensity of Wagner's creation.  Realistically, how does one make sense of Senta?  Kupfer's brooding, internal, dreaming, romantic/compassionate heroine matches the self-focused dreaming of Wagner's longing for a ""perfect woman"", loving, attracted to him, yet eternally nurturant.

His stage presence is overpowering, giving credibility to Senta's obsession.  It goes without saying that the orchestra is up to the Bayreuth standard.
