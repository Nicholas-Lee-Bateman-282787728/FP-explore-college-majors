 Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate for Self-Defense: Combat Karate for the street).",1257897600,,386,4.787878787878788
8608279,5,6305434522,"For anyone seriously interested in Japanese Shotokan Karate this tape is a must.  The kata is superbly demonstrated by Yahara Sensei, former winner of the All-Japan and World Kata Championships, and renowned for his dynamic  karate style.  As an invaluable source of reference, this should be a part  of every Martial Artist's library. Yahara Sensei gives his own views and  opinions about the kata, and the ""feeling"" one should have when  performing it.  If you want to understand this difficult kata, there is no  better videotape available anywhere.",926640000,3,552,5.193181818181818
