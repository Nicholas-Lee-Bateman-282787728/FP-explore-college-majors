1219219,5,B00000IBMF,"Vincente Minnelli directed this lively and intelligent version of George Axelrod's play about a gangster who dies and returns as a very lovely female: Debbie Reynolds. She has to convince Tony Curtis that she or he is really back! This is one of those great color CinemaScope situation comedies that were so popular back in the good old days of the 60s. You have to accept the situation to enjoy the plot and appreciate the humor. The cast also includes Pat Boone, Walter Matthau, Martin Gabel and Ellen (McRae) Burstyn. This is a real product of that feel-good time during the 60s. I always enjoyed this film.",996537600,40,610,4.710280373831775
1219220,4,B00000IBMF,"I saw this movie once on television over fifteen years ago and have looked for it to be released as a video or to come back on again ever since, for i  find it to be hilarious (especially mattheau) and both artsy and full of  high sixties glamour. many of the people who watched it with me agreed and  in fact, we all began using mattheau's pronunciation of the word home as  hume to this very day. enjoy!",967334400,5,405,4.153846153846154
1219221,3,B00000IBMF,"Judging by the amount of reviews written here,obviously this isn't a  popular film. But just in case someone actually looks up this movie,I have  to let you know this is a wonderful,silly,amusing comedy. Curtis and  Reynolds are perfect on-screen together. Both deliver fun performances,as  does Pat Boone. Here's a good movie to watch when your a little down,and in  need of a laugh. It will definitely bring a smile on your face. A little  personal note:A remake followed this film some 20 years later Blake  Edward's ""Switch"". But between the two I prefer this one.",965952000,15,568,4.91578947368421

1219292,2,B00000IBMF,"I've wanted a copy of this film for a long time, and finally decided to order it, despite the pan-and-scan. How bad could it be? It's actually much worse that I expected, perhaps the worst I've ever seen. The titles are a tiny 2.3:1 window swimming in a sea of black, badly matted. The film proper is at least the full height, but with very little ""scan"" - important elements are left off. The images are grainy and (surprisingly) over-compressed. Just awful. I also have my reservations about the longevity of DVD-R's. Disks I've burned myself have become unreadable after a few years.

Gets a second star simply for the movie itself. I hadn't seen it in years, and (if you lived through the 60's, like me) is just about a perfect comedy.",1476403200,4,739,4.556390977443609

It plays like a stage play on screen, very 60s in its conception, which I love. Great Debbie performance, very early Ellen Burstyn as well, good supporting cast, not the best Tony Curtis but he had his ups and downs IMHO. It's got a dark comedy feel and a bit of serious amongst all the farce. Worth seeing this forgotten movie.",1424563200,,490,4.223404255319149

1219393,1,B00000IBMF,"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE, FOR 1964.  Oh, it's silly, and some parts are ridiculously lame, but once you check credibility at the door, it's a cute and entertaining film.  HOWEVER...the one star is for the presentation, as this is a picture that deserves its normal format ratio presentation.  Fox obviously doesn't care about its product...it only cares about taking your money and giving you a crummy product in return.  Phooey on Fox...the punks!  In my opinion, they should either issue the film with a modicum of respect for the audience, or don't issue it at all, for crying out loud.  Why issue crap?",1419811200,,603,4.75

Tony Curtis comes to LA to attend Charlie's Funeral and then someone brings an almost amnesiac Debbie Reynolds to Charlie's house.  Womanizing Charlie has come back to earth as a woman.  As a woman Charlie decides to blackmail the women he slept with and make some money.  As a comedy this movie is funny  and enjoyable.  Debbie Reynolds does a great job of being a man in a woman's body.  She sits like a man, walks like a man and acts like a man. Pat Boone thinks he loves the woman who was Charlie and tries to court her. Tony Curtis tries to keep up with every thing going on and starts to fall behind.

1219436,4,B00000IBMF,"Having seen this movie as a child, I've always liked the story and wanted to see if if held up after all of these years.  I have to say that yes it did and Tony Curtis, as always delivers as the handsome blue-eyed charmer, but in this film he takes a different role as the best friend with a kind heart.  This is generally not his usual stance in films and it was refreshing to see.  Also, I enjoyed Debbie Reynolds, who as a true comedic talent took the role of playing a man who was turned into a woman, but still acted like a man to new heights!  It was very interesting and unique to see that type of character for that decade.  Debbie committed to the role and actually pulled it off!  Then, there was Walter Matthau, who is hilarious as the scum bag movie movie producer and his weird, fake accent from who knows where was very funny! I'd totally recommend this film to all Debbie Reynolds and Tony Curtis fans everywhere, and it was great to go down memory lane!",1402963200,3,969,4.239130434782608
1219437,5,B00000IBMF,"This is a clever comedy that parodies hollywood to some extent.  I think Debbie Reynolds does a great job in her role of a man ""reborn"" as a woman.  All the little behaviors that separate the genders come into play.",1402444800,,215,4.35
1219438,5,B00000IBMF,"What do you do when your best friend dies, and is reincarnated as a beautiful woman?

1219458,5,B00000IBMF,"This is the story of a womanizer shot in his activity, and he comes back to life as a woman in the form of Debbie Reynolds. Tony Curtis is the best friend of the womanizer, and he is rudely educated on the point that Debbie Reynolds really is his departed buddy. As the just deserts, Debbie Reynolds is pursued by the man that killed her as Charlie, and the wife of this guy then shoots Charlie in the form of Debbie. Then just as Tony Curtis is getting ready to go back to Europe, he meets Debbie Reynolds as another character, and she has a Great Dane named Charlie. This dog then does something, and you realize that Charlie has metamorphosed into yet another form. There is much more hilarity in between, but that would give away too much of the plot of the movie.

I think that this is one of his better efforts. The movie seems ridiculous on first glance, but it really grows on you. This is a nice print and the sound is good. I must agree with the other reviewers that Fox should be releasing their ""Cinema Archive"" series in the same manner as Warner or even Universal. I don't imagine that Fox will ever rerelease this product in DVD format in widescreen mode, so if you want to see this picture, this is the only way to go.",1384473600,,598,4.348214285714286

Some very funny bits and really good performances.  Walter Matheau is hilarious as the over the top movie producer, Debbie Reynolds nails it as the playboy killed by the producer who comes back to life as a woman.

1219479,5,B00000IBMF,"Vincente Minnelli's 1965 comedy based on the great George Axelrod's stage play, ""Goodbye Charlie"" is one of the first really certain gender-bender via reincarnation sex comedies that Hollywood has ever produced.  Starring Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds and Pat Boone (in a lesser role although given star billing) and co-starring Joanna Barnes, Ellen (MacRae) Burstyn, Laura Devon, Martin Gabel, Roger Carmel, Walter Matthau (and featuring Donna Michelle, a playboy playmate who is seen dancing in the film's opening segment with one of the most exciting twist parties put to film).  This anecdote leads me to mention the score and songs by Andre Previn (and Dory Langdon (the future Dory Previn?) certainly some of the most unusual ever written directly for the screen.  This was Boone's last daring role.  Had he not seen it for more than a sixties sex comedy with a gender bender gimmick, he may not have made the film at all, although his part is still rather virginal.  Despite the controversy over 20th Century-Fox's decision to provide pan and scan treatment to its Cinemascope widescreen product (remember, the masses of the movie-going public must all be considered),  ""Goodbye Charlie,"" after a long wait from its full screen VHS presentation, has been dumped into the studio's MOD enterprise, Cinema Archives for a pricey cost.  Color by Deluxe looks beautiful as does the film, which if you've never seen it, do not let anything stop you.  Entertaining romp.  Just go figure, goodbye!",1372464000,3,1497,5.127572016460905

While image transfer for this DVD is fine, there are moments when the sound suffers slightly, but not enough to detract from the viewing of this film.  What does detract is the fact that the original was filmed in widescreen, but Fox (in their infinite wisdom) decided to use a pan and scan version of the film (4x3 ratio).  In this day and age of the widescreen TV, there is no excuse to release a film in this cropped format any longer.  And since this is a ""burn-on-order"" DVD, it is unlikely it will ever get the proper treatment.  Still, it is well worth adding it to your DVD collection.

Of all the films wew may have seen 30 plus years ago how many can you recall..it seems like a piece of fluff..the plays is short they say and hes been inventive and play like has added some thought to it, an egyptian book, reincarnation makes you wonder throughout about this or that, and doesnt stay at the low end of life but gives the actress in this case debie reynolds something to do with this part and she comes off better than tony? A cuckold of sorts is shot who comes back as a woman(previously a man) and much humour is built up into the largely dialogue, and its kept fairly interesting and the lead moves it on and garners are interest..is life as enjoyable as a woman or a man..from a character who's been both..as she tries to make the world disappear to discover where she wants to be..novels, booze and what have you..thats a joke? So many people recall this film,scenes, episodes, dialogue, old books, and its really a debbie reynolds film as its written up for her as its subject..and thats why we recall it since here, she seems to relish the role..I recall it always being on TV. Tony curtis during the 60's turned into and i won't say developed an actor of sex type films, and he was a serious actor, and he recalls Houdini from his youth..and he just couldn't find the write roles..not even a few..changing agents..or what was going on..went to europe..youn gpersons today view Houdini and get into it..as I do..one wrong film even ifits a success can turn you this way or that..but at times its hard to figure..I had a lot of fun here..like the perennial viewers of this film",1370649600,,2043,4.364829396325459

1219486,2,B00000IBMF,"Goodbye Charlie is Vincente Minnelli's last good (and sadly underrated) comedy and has been unavailable on DVD until its recent emergence in the latest batch of Fox Cinema Archives DVD-Rs on demand. I was initially excited at the prospect of catching up with this gender-bending and deliciously tasteless romp again after some decades, but on receiving my copy I'm angry and bitterly disappointed that News Corporation have yet again consigned another important Cinemascope film to the sorry fate of an utterly appalling, murky, offensively distorted pan and scan version. Fox films between 1953 and the mid-1960s have a special place in film history because they led the way to the possibilities of the widescreen format which was quickly taken up by most of the Hollywood majors and even some of the minors. Several directors like Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause), Anthony Mann (The Man from Laramie), Vincente Minnelli and Douglas Sirk (The Tarnished Angels) quickly adapted to Scope's visual possibilities with verve and style. Minnelli became of the great masters of the widescreen in his melodramas, comedies and musicals - without meticulously adapting framing and movement to meet the demands of this then exciting new format, the dazzling set pieces of Some Came Running, The Cobweb or Home from the Hill would not have achieved half the visual and rhythmic impact which makes them so watchable today. I just wish Fox Cinema Archives would get this right. They seem totally oblivious to their audience for these films. To whom are they talking when they patronizingly claim that ""this DVD has been modified to suit your home screen""? Widescreen sets are a dime a dozen these days: I don't personally know any self-respecting cinephile who hasn't invested in one. Original aspect ratios matter. I won't be buying any more of this product from the post-scope years until someone in News Corporation starts listening.",1368057600,42,1927,5.159744408945687

1219488,1,B00000IBMF,"I have eagerly been awaiting a proper digital release of ""Goodbye Charlie"" since the advent of the DVD format. Unfortunately, this Fox ""Cinema Archives"" DVD is anything but a proper release of this colorful, 1964 CinemaScope classic.

My current home video of this film is an ""unofficial"" DVD I had imported from Asia. The quality is less than desirable, but I bought it several years ago as a placeholder until Fox released the film. Remarkably, my import of this film is of better quality than this Fox Cinema Archive release. The major problem? Fox has cropped the picture from the original 2.35:1 to 1.33:1. In layman's terms, this simply means that Fox has released the film with huge sections (nearly 40%) of the picture missing. The result is a poorly framed picture that has been mutilated to a ""full screen"" picture.

This is a great little 60's comedy, but Fox's total disregard for its back catalog of classics has resulted in a film that is practically unwatchable. Unfortunately, this is the case with almost all of Fox's widescreen films that they have released as part of their ""Cinema Archives"" collection. If Fox took the same steps as Warner Bros. or Sony, this routine mangling of classic films would not be happening.

Bottom line: if you are looking for a faithful, quality rendering of this film, this DVD+R is not worth the investment. Consider looking at 3rd party seller sites if you would like to find a widescreen version of this film.",1367107200,83,1462,4.816733067729084

1219499,5,B00000IBMF,"GOODBYE CHARLIE is one of those rare movies that I can pinpoint where and when I first saw it: Easter Sunday 1965, the FAIRMOUNT theater, New Haven, CT. I was 10 going on 11. Most of the story's subtleties went right over my head back then. Probably was a good thing, cuz this is really a kinky film.

Today I finally watched the tape of ""Charlie"" that I bought right here in June of '04 for a fiver (sorry!). Forty-five years later and I could still recall some of it. The theme lyrics written by the future Mrs. Andre Previn, Dory Langdon. That attractive Malibu beachhouse. Nerdy mama's boy, Pat Boone (it was typecasting!). An alcoholic Great Dane. Debbie Reynolds shrieking when she realizes that she's no longer Charlie Sorel. The molto '60s twist party on Walter Matthau's yacht which opens the picture. A eulogy for an audience of three. And so on.

But wow, the stuff I missed as a kid. After showering, the new Charlie's auto-erotic plans. Her leering at other gals at a fashionable salon. A physical attraction to best buddy George (Curtis). This new ""Charlene"" is definitely bi, wouldn't you say? Pretty racy stuff for 1964.

Reincarnation, the main theme of this hip comedy, is a nifty idea. With my luck however, I'd probably come back as a Ponderosa lemon tree or a toadstool. Or maybe as myself. Some cosmic joke, that.

Back in the late 60s, the CBS network regularly ran this movie, not that I ever watched it. You know, BTDT. A good cast solidly directed by Vincente Minnelli and an amusing self-fulfilling story, yet ""Goodbye Charlie"" has STILL not reincarnated on DVD. I'll bet it returns to life on Beta-max first.

She thinks up this really wicked idea to collect money from all the woman she (he) had affairs with. Tony Curtis, his best friend, thinks this is awful and to his dismay is starting to fall for her, which is driving him nuts.  The party that killed Charlie in the first place gets involved and another killing takes place. So there goes Debbie , so you may think, but not so.

So much for Don't Ask, Don't Tell). Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds have a great time (and so will you) in this farce about Charlie, a two-timing cad, who gets shot by a jealous Walter Matthau (who uses some strange americanized mitel-europa accent) aboard Matthau's yacht and comes back to life as a woman--Debbie Reynolds. (There was a remake but the original is much funnier.) Tony Curtis plays the dead man's best friend who Reynolds is staying with. After many funny incidents where Reynolds finally proves to Curtis she really is Charlie, Curtis realizes he's fallen for Reynolds. There's also one hilarious scene where Reynolds/Charlie has lunch with his former paramours and since Charlie knows all their secrets there's a  bit of funny blackmailing that goes on. The ending is a great surprise to some, obvious to others but this piece of funny 60's fluff makes for a very enjoyable evening at the movies.",1100131200,7,1223,4.908212560386473
