8270667,4,B00005O0SW,"Tale about a married couple that are friends with an unmarried couple.  The guy in the unmarried couple kills himself and leaves a note that says, ""See ya."" His gal is angry and wants to get rid of everything he ever saw or touched.  She gives the married couple the piano.  The married couple's mission: Get the piano home.  The guy does not want to get a truck saying it will be too expensive.  He proposes pushing it home.  His wife has to go do some work as a voice-over actress and says she will be back.  They eventually argue and plan to split-up when the piano reaches the house.

The wife, meanwhile, has an old postcard that someone sent to her. She does not know who sent it and wants to find out.  The husband wants to celebrate the Sabbath for the first time.  He runs out of time pushing the piano so he puts it in a parking place and spends Saturday at a 24-hour coffee house (this takes place in Seattle). He discusses deep thoughts with a patron.

A nice conclusion. Interesting character study.",1373500800,,1012,4.358288770053476
