A majority of the anime I find myself attracted to could almost be mistaken for some of the finer American made ""cartoons"" save for the fact that the DVDs contain the original Japanese vocal track.  Enter The Story of Saiunkoku from Geneon, distributed through Funimation.  Not only is the show overflowing with Japanese sensibilities and visual charm, it's built on a solid foundation of Asain culture so thoroughly that there's no mistaking its origin regardless of the language track to which you find yourself listening.

Coming in at a whopping 975-minute runtime, The Story of Saiunkoku Complete Season One box set consists of 39 episodes spanning 9 discs.  The packaging breaks it down into five thin pack cases housed in a charming cardboard outer slipcase.  The show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative TV 13 & Up rating due to a few adult-themes (war, good versus evil on an epic scale), some light sexual innuendo (a king everyone thinks is homosexual), and a little bit of drama.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning both the original Japanese vocal track is present as well the choice of an English dub (either presented in Stereo) with the option of running English subtitles available with either vocal track.

Extras include textless opening and ending themes and a host of Geneon anime previews on each and every one of the nine DVDs.

The story, which has to be watched to be fully understood (or appreciated for that matter) goes something like this:  Shurei, daughter of a broke aristocrat in fictional medieval country Saiunkoku has everything it takes to be a member of government except for the opportunity (because women are prohibited in this society).

Her father, a glorified librarian with a title, discovers the opportunity of a lifetime for young Shurei as the king's personal consort. Using his influence, her father is able to secure the position so that Shurei can put her motherly instincts to good use (and hopefully secure some wealth in the process) by supervising the young (19 year-old) king of the nation while injecting a little motivation and ambition into his routine.

Suspecting an arrogant and close-minded ruler, Shurei charges into the role only to discover a gentle, shy and insecure young ruler who just so happens to be of similar age. They strike up a solid relationship in no time, each forcing the other to change their view of members on such opposite sides of society's spectrum.  King Ryuki, inspired by Shurei's knowledge, passion and ambition soon takes a more active role in the governing of his land while simultaneously providing Shurei an opportunity to put her skills to use despite the fact that women are not able to pursue such ambitions directly.

Now I'm not sure whether or not that summary captures the scope of the prose, so I will follow it by saying that those expecting wild action scenes, hilarious dialog sessions, passionate lovemaking sequences or even a quick moving plot structure will probably be disappointed.  The truth is that The Story of Saiunkoku is an anime piece that requires, in fact demands, a certain level of patience and commitment from its viewer if satisfaction is to be found.  In other words it relies on very few gimmicks along the way to tell its tale and makes no apologies for doing so.

The grand prose is methodic and evenly paced with character development taking the foreground of each episode.  Sure there are moments sprinkled about that may earn a chuckle or build a little tension, but they serve to break the monotony of the show's rhythmic progression rather than to act as a selling point on their own.

The visuals are an interesting blend of traits with character models absolutely rife with detail, occasionally at the expense of the backgrounds.  Then just as quickly, that relationship can completely inverse with background art that is simply stunning to behold.  Again though, the viewer gets a definite sense that the show's creators deliberately avoided going too far in any single direction that could possibly detract from the story being told.

The fact that the first season consists of 39 episodes spanning nine DVDs should act as some indication to the type of pacing one is to expect.  Almost like sipping hot coffee or sitting down to read the newspaper, Saiunkoku is best enjoyed at a relaxed pace and is a sort of acquired taste.  Action junkies may be quick to dismiss the show once the opening narration (which is almost like something from Lord of the Rings) fades to a semi--contemporary setting where a young teacher tells the tale to her wide-eyed students and similarly diehard fans of the risqu&eacute; will likely grow tired of waiting for lead character Shurei Hong and King Ryuki Shi to just hurry up and get it on.

The viewer who will get the most from this series is most likely someone who enjoys Japanese culture and politics coupled to fantastic artwork and youthful protagonists.  I wouldn't even think of suggesting that the show's for everyone but for the few it really is for, prepare to be impressed.",1254873600,34,5240,4.912698412698413
3939942,5,B002KD9C2M,"If you love a good heroine story chock full of romance and political intrigue with some humor tossed in then this series is for you. I think its safe to compare it to Mysterious Play (Fushigi Yugi) as there are a few similarities between them namely the romantic circles this series leads you on in addition to a bit of the political crazyness that also somewhat surrounded Fushigi Yugi (ie: the wars)

In any case if romance is what your looking for with a steady moving plot line you may enjoy this series. I do have to warn though it takes a few episodes to really get the feel of this series but I found myself watching seasons 1 and 2 and being pleased with both.",1252281600,12,668,4.301587301587301
8371889,5,B002KD9C2M,"Absolutely one of the best romance dramas I have ever watched! With some light humor, bits of action, creative characters & interesting plots -this anime series will keep you engaged through the very end. Be prepared for a wonderful story & a fantastic journey! You will not regret it. Will always be a top favorite!",1496448000,,316,4.763636363636364
8371890,5,B002KD9C2M,"Love it
it was in good condition except for a corner bunched up but everything that was important was fine",1471651200,,106,4.35
8371891,5,B002KD9C2M,"I love the opening and closing songs.  The story gets more and more complicated.  Even my husband is hooked.  It's a shame that the second season is not available, and that there is really no ""ending.""",1404691200,,201,4.527777777777778
8371892,5,B002KD9C2M,Loved the first series. I watched the second series online in Japanese with English subtitles. I was disappointed that there wasn't going to be a third series since there were loose endings in the story that weren't brought to a conclusion. The seller was prompt.,1369612800,,263,4.866666666666666
8371893,5,B002KD9C2M,"Though not the most beautiful anime to look at, Saiunkoku is an amazing series. I was very drawn in by the subtleties of the characters, and my ability to remember so many, when usually I am so bad at remembering. I am not usually a fan of Shoujo, but this had real heart and strength in it's characters, which I was pleasantly surprised to find mostly not stereotypes, and a very strong, and interesting political plot, with a good strong female character who isn't combative. I was also fascinated by an anime which didn't have a huge amount of fighting (I suppose that is fitting considering the main character cannot fight). I came to find interest in the jealousies, or lack there-of between characters, and a few surprisingly sad moments, with relatively deep ""villian"" characters. Just, wonderful all around, highly recommended!",1308700800,,835,4.929078014184397
8371894,5,B002KD9C2M,"I suppose a lot of people would compare The Story of Saiunkoku to Twelve Kingdoms.  There are a lot of parallels, including a strong-willed central female character who has to discover herself and her place in the world.  The two are also similar in that they are fantasy-type period pieces with both Japanese and Chinese cultural influences and imperial court intrigue and conspiracy.

The two are not identical, however.  The Story of Saiunkoku is a lot lighter of a piece, without some of the more difficult themes that make Twelve Kingdoms unique.  It isn't a flaw, but merely a different kind of series.  The Story of Saiunkoku is funnier than Twelve Kingdoms, with more emphasis on the romances between the characters.  The political intrigues of The Story of Saiunkoku are also less advanced than those of Twelve Kingdoms, which makes sense when you realize the novels the anime was based on were targeted to a young female audience.

You have to expect the slower pacing and decreased action that comes from this kind of storyline.  Either that is something you are interested in, or it isn't.  You watch this anime for the beautiful artwork and development of characters, not for action or deep thought provoking themes.  All of the characters in the series are engaging, and each has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses.  The only thing that can get annoying as you get farther into the story is the way that the romance between the main female character Shuurei and the king Ryuuki unfolds so slowly, with frequent interruptions due to political problems and emergencies.",1278892800,3,1593,4.902985074626866
8371895,4,B002KD9C2M,"I simply love Saiunkoku Monogatari, so I had to buy it once it came out on DVD.  My only big complaint (and the reason for 4 stars) is that Funimation didn't fix Geneon's subtitle issues when they re-released this series.
Shuurei's last name is Kou (as in crimson), not hong(the Chinese reading of the kanji) (anyone listening to the Japanese audio track will find this irritating), and Ryuuki is an Emperor, not a king (there is a difference).  I haven't finished going through the box set, so I'm not sure how many problems, but I was hoping that Funimation would have fixed Geneon's use of Hong.  I can see using it for the dub to minimize the confusion between kou and ko (crimson and yellow) as the creator requested for localization, but I would have preferred for them to have left the subtitles translated correctly.  It is very hard to follow the subtitles with the Japanese audio because of this (I hear Kou, and see Hong....it does get irritating), but besides this, and the bit about Ryuuki being an Emperor (which is different from a King in many aspects), this is an awesome show.  Even with these slight defects, I'll definitely be picking up series 2 when I get the chance (which is another 39 episodes)",1273881600,,1219,4.625
8371896,5,B002KD9C2M,"I'm a big anime fan, have seen a lot of it, and, I think that everyone who claims to be a fan should see this anime at least once. With a lot of talk of politics, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I promise that it makes up for it with drama, romance, intrigue, rather cool fighting scenes, and a great deal of humor. Laugh-out-loud funny, with a solid plot, and startling plot twists. The characters are simply amazing and well presented so that you can connect with them, some of whom have some rather fascinating oddities (one who always wears a mask, one who can get lost within two steps, etc), and you fall in love with all of them. Even the villains are fascinating and make you want to see more of them! The English dub, which I was rather worried about, is actually one of the better jobs I've seen done (good choice of voice actors as well). So I rate this a MUST see, it has something for everyone, you won't regret it.",1258156800,9,937,4.211111111111111
8371897,5,B002KD9C2M,I just bought this DVD box set. I watched the series a long time ago back when it first came out. I stopped watching the series because the second season was too long and I couldn't find them online. But when I saw it in FYE I just bought it because I missed it. BOY!!!! I fell in love with it again and I bought the series box set. It's worth it.,1257897600,,347,3.8333333333333335
8371898,5,B002KD9C2M,"Amazing.  This series has such beautiful art with a mix of Asian culture.  Each character has his/her own personality which contributes to the story plot.  They capture your heart and make you laugh time after time.  Though most people say Funimation recycles their voice actors, they really kept close to the sound of the voice of the Japanese this time 'round.  Though it's not very popular, I think a lot of people could get into this if they would just watch an episode.",1256688000,,474,4.662650602409639
