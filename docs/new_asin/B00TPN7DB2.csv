7015714,5,B00TPN7DB2,Prompt! I love these two movies! Great company! Thank you!,1472342400,,58,4.9
7015715,5,B00TPN7DB2,So glad to find this with both.  One of my daughter's favorite movies.  Good quality movie and plays well.  Miranda is a very free-spirited mermaid.  Surprising dialogue for the era. Mad about Men is the better of the two movies.,1471651200,3,229,4.65
7015716,4,B00TPN7DB2,"So much fun. I wholeheartedly recommend both of these light farcical films. They are a joy to watch, witty, and sweet.",1458259200,3,118,4.666666666666667
7015717,5,B00TPN7DB2,"Set is actually a sequel...didnt realize it at first, but so happy with it. Love these movies.",1433548800,6,94,4.588235294117647
8702644,2,B00TPN7DB2,"I bought this film after reading reviews on IMDb.  I always liked Glynis Johns, never saw either of these movies, and the first movie had great reviews. So I decided to order it.  I tend to enjoy old movies.  Well, I didn't really care for either of these mermaid movies.  They were ""cute,"" I guess, but not very entertaining to me.  Definitely not Glynis at her best.  Guess I need to buy No Highway in the Sky, where she stars with a Jimmy Stewart.  THAT movie is very entertaining to me.",1531872000,,490,4.318681318681318
8702645,4,B00TPN7DB2,Liked the two movie,1522022400,,19,4.0
8702646,5,B00TPN7DB2,"This double feature came to our attention because we have been long-time fans of the film ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.""

These films are a different take on the mermaid concept, but highly entertaining.

The first feature is especially meaningful because it has a pairing of David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns years before the played husband and wife in ""Mary Poppins.""

The second feature is in color, and works well as a sequel -- and in color!",1519603200,,445,4.753246753246753
8702647,3,B00TPN7DB2,"Two light-comedy-fantasies from 1940s-50s Britain. Both are quite dumb, but entertaining enough, with a surprising amount of risque humor. The picture quality's not great, nor the sound, but both presentations are watchable; they're not exactly high art anyway.

If you're interested in a /better/ 1948 light-comedy-fantasy about a homewrecking mermaid (yep: two of 'em in the same year!), and with far superior picture and sound quality, check out the Blu-ray of Universal's ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.""",1508976000,,506,5.571428571428571

8702652,5,B00TPN7DB2,Fun movies made in 1948 with British humor.,1483747200,2,43,4.5
8702653,5,B00TPN7DB2,"Glynis Johns is a favorite of mine, always brings her best to any performance. She deserved far more leading roles than she got, so it's a treat to see her in a leading role in these two movies. All the actors seem to be having a fun time.

No movie about mermaids is going to be completely logical, just sit back and watch the fun.",1478908800,3,332,4.107692307692307
