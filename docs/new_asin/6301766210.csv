What a lovely movie, just really sweet and a delight to watch... made in the days when movie stars were less worried about being paid millions of dollars instead of really loving their craft enough to just make an enjoyable film worth watching.",1229731200,2,313,4.607142857142857
370983,4,6301766210,"This is a wonderful movie, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been put on DVD seeing as it has three great stars - Loretta Young, William Holden, and Robert Mitchum.  A good story of unfolding love and devotion in pioneer times.  PLEASE PUT THIS ON DVD!",1204588800,10,251,4.434782608695652
370984,5,6301766210,"Fun Western Film based on the early 1800s with Willaim Holden (Bridge on the River Kwai) as a frontier farmer who loses his dear wife with a son to raise. He marries the natural beauty Loretta Young (The Bishop's Wife) as a marraige of conveniance as she will be his housekeeper and teacher for his son. Holden and son think lightly of Young and both treat her as a laborer and emotionally harshly as they both miss the first wife/mother. Holden and Young live under the same roof but not the same bedroom and without any physical interaction of any kind (but she is Loretta Young!). Young though plays an independent woman who plans on surival by practicing her own wilderness skills secretly adapting beyond anyone's later belief. But suddenly out of the wilderness steps the king of the masculine leer, Robert Mitchum (Cape Fear) and he immediately recognizes the chemical breakdown between husband and wife and he is ready to fullfill the void for the lucious Young. All this attention to Young awakens Holden who suddenly recognizes the person and beauty of Young and the adventure takes off as Holden and Mitchum become rivals with interceding Indians entering the fray and Young emerges as an independent Lioness. A very pleasant love triangle that perhaps has a little message, ""You may not know what you have until you are about to lose it"".",1165017600,6,1350,4.798283261802575
370985,4,6301766210,"I knew this movie had possibilities when I saw that both Robert Mitchum and William Holden were starring in it.  It is a relatively short movie and doesn't take too long to draw you in.  We see an opening scene of a widower in grief at his remote cabin in the wilderness.  He has a young adolescent and senses the practical need of another wife to share in the amplified duties of the time and place.  He heads off to the nearest established settlement in this post-revolutionary frontier.  The only acceptable choice is a bonded slave woman.  A non-romantic marriage is carried out for proprieties sake and the ""family"" returns to the remote farm.  The development of relationships is the core of ""Rachel and the Stranger"".  Holden and Mitchum are good in their roles but they are outdone by Loretta Young.  The acting of the young, dyslexically-named Gary Gray, is also quite effective.  I found myself drawn into this romance in the making.  It has a surprisingly subtle style to it that makes it all the more effective.  This is another one of those ""sleepers"" from the past.",1158624000,5,1079,4.680851063829787
370986,5,6301766210,"I just watched this movie for the first time. The cast is incredible. Too bad it has not been released on DVD. I would

love to know more background about the film.",1153094400,7,164,4.125
370987,4,6301766210,"Rachel and the Stranger is like Sarah Plain and Tall, the children's story. It concerns a man (William Holden) and his son (Gary Gray) after his wife Susan dies. He realizes that it is proper for his son to be raised by a woman and sets out to get a new wife (Loretta Young). He frees Rachel from servitude by marrying her, but she is basically treated as a maid in her new home. Her husband's traveling friend (Robert Mitchum) serves to integrate her into the family, but in the process begins a territorial fued between the two men for Rachel's affections.

Although the action isn't wildly exciting, the characters are interesting enough to carry the story along nicely. Young and Mitchum in particular contribute. Young uses her eyes and a tranquil personality to convey her character; she has much fewer lines than one might expect. Mitchum is rugged and charismatic, the jell that holds the family together. He also has quite a nice voice, with a deep Bing Crosby-esque quality about it that makes him all the more appealing.",1149724800,9,1031,4.727777777777778
370988,5,6301766210,"In the olden days, there were white slaves as well as black.  Rachel And The Stranger may be the only movie to explore that topic, though lightly.
The whole plot is based on antiquated mores, and all the more interesting for it.  It starts out like The Courtship of Eddie's Father in the wild west.  William Holden (Bridge on the River Kwai) is a widower trying to raise his young son, Gary Gray (The Next Voice You Hear), at a cabin in the wilderness.  On the advice of the parson in a nearby town, he marrys a bond slave played by Loretta Young (The Bishop's Wife), buying her out of servitude.  But the marriage is only for convenience, to make the living arrangements proper; he still treats the woman as a slave, requiring her to cook and keep the house and mother the boy, and sleep in the loft alone.  But when an old family friend, Robert Mitchum (Night of the Hunter), passes through hunting, and shows an interest in the girl, jealously brings out the husband in Holden.
The script is engaging, the actors charming, as with such classics as Shane, Of Human Hearts, Friendly Persuasion, etc.  This was probably Mitchum's first singing role.  Loretta Young is beautiful as ever as the sympathetic slave, and Holden plays the widower with unresolved feelings just right to make the whole thing work.
Recommended if you like the above mentioned films, and may be of interest to history students as well.  It's entertaining, well made and very well acted, and the aspect about the bond slave makes Rachel And The Stranger a truly unique film.",1115164800,37,1547,4.637362637362638
370989,5,6301766210,This is one of my favorite movies. I really like loretta young. She plays a bond woman who is bought to help a man out with the work on the farm & to take care of his young son. He does marry her but only because it is the right thing to do. It is in name only. His first wife died. Then along comes Robert Mitchum. He treats Rachael like a woman & it opens her husbands eyes. He also starts to see her as his woman & the boy is starting to like her also because Jim likes her. They even fight over her.,1110240000,19,503,3.7547169811320753

371122,5,6301766210,"I am thoroughly enjoying being introduced to some of these older movies. I was privileged to view Rachel and the Stranger yesterday and thought it was a really good movie. Loretta Young was absolutely beautiful and played her part so well. I learned about people being 'bonded' as servants to others and in her case, she was bonded because her father had debts when he died. William Holden 'bought' her when his wife died and he needed help on his farm and with his young son. He reluctantly married her and I thought the part where he took her wedding ring off and gave it back to the lady who owned it actually hurt my feelings for Rachel. Their living conditions were most primitive and it did amaze me to see Rachel (Loretta) wearing a yoke when she carried milk in buckets to the house. She was very kind and loving with her new stepson and managed to deal with her life situation. Robert Mitchum did really well in his role as the friend of the family, too. The Indian scenes were quite good and even scary. The flaming arrows get to me every time. It was a good movie to make a person realize how hard our early settlers had to work to make our country what it is. I recommend this movie especially to fans of older frontier type movies. I had a really good time watching it.",1429833600,,1282,4.345833333333333

I just don't understand why this and movies like The Farmer's Daughter, which I believe Ms. Young won an Oscar for ... are unavailable to the classic movie watching public.

371185,5,6301766210,"""Rachel and the Stranger"" made in 1948 is one of the many enjoyable
movies of the 1940's, a time when movies were pure entertainment -
light hearted, believable and not offensive.  If you are somewhat tired
of to-day's unrealistic movies and you are looking for a pleasant change,
then this movie is for you.

Although it is classified as a western, it is not a cowboy western but an
early frontier western set in the days of the early pioneers and like a
good book your interest is held to the very end.

The story told is simple but absorbing and although there is not an
abundance of action scenes, there are excellent performances by a
talented cast who play out their roles naturally and convincingly.

The cast includes:
Loretta Young as Rachel Harvey
William Holden as David Harvey
Robert Mitchum as Jim Fairways
Gary Gray as Davey

Loretta Young is very attractive and a fine actress, whilst William Holden
and Robert Mitchum perform their best as usual.  We should not over-look
the fact that child actor Gary Gray was outstanding and for those who are
interested in the finer points, Gary Gray beat that other fine child actor
Bobby Driscoll for the role of Davey and I would add that Gary Gray was
the ideal choice.  That of course is in itself some achievement.  Gary Gray
looks and acts the part well.

The story told concerns David Harvey who is suffering a period of
depression after the loss of his wife and he constantly visits her grave
site  near their cabin where he spends a lot of his time mourning her
passing on.  Things get so bad that he neglects his chores and
unfortunately his son.

David Harvey has an unattached friend Jim Fairways who occasionally
drops in for a visit to see David and Davey and he is surprised to find
one day that David has taken in a bonded woman Rachel to assist with
the housework and to teach his son basic schooling as his wife would
have done.  David Harvey is a decent man and treats Rachel well and
later marries her but of course this is really only a marriage of
convenience.  David shows no real affection towards Rachel and Davey
dislikes her mainly due to the fact that she is a bonded woman.

This of course all changes when smooth-talking Jim Fairways arrives and
takes an obvious interest in Rachel.  David starts to realize that she means
far more to him then he first thought and young Davey now thinks better
of her than at first because she has become proficient with a gun and
saves his life.

This movie is on VHS tape which was purchased brand new and sealed
from an Amazon Marketplace supplier.  It is in pristine condition and I
believe that it would not look or sound any better on DVD.

This movie is a pleasant relief from to-day's nonsense and so-called arthouse
movies and it makes you feel good to relax and watch it.

Highly recommended.",1377820800,,2820,4.52465483234714
371186,5,6301766210,I love this movie. I think that the kiss at the end has to be one of the most wonderful romantic kisses in film history!,1377043200,,120,3.84

This is a ""G"" rated movie as far as I am concerned.  I feel it is one of Loretta Young's best performances.  I feel that Robert Mitchum stole the show from William Holden.  His presence was much more commanding.  The story of the son learning to love the second wife as a second mother is very good.  I recommend this movie to all movie lovers of good clean movies.",1366156800,2,492,4.010309278350515

371234,4,6301766210,"Surprisingly, Robert Mitchum can sing, and a fun little song he does with his friend's wife and son makes this movie worth watching.

Back in the 1700's; poor people coming from Europe, to the U.S.; paid for their ticket on the ship by indenturing themselves as bond-servants for so many years; sometimes as long as 7-years. In this story a widowed man buys a female bond-servant to be a mother to his son; marries her, but treats her like a bond-servant with endless chores and coldness, rather than giving her her freedom, and treating her like a wife. A trapper, friend offers to buy the woman and set her free, and a jealous rivalry ensues.

Filmed on location in a cabin in the woods alongside a river in hostile Indian country.

A film about relationships; a little action; a relaxed pace, but enjoyable.",1359849600,2,810,4.65034965034965
371235,3,6301766210,"lotsa surprises with this film, had NO idea that William Holden was so handsome compared to his later roles i.e. Love is a Many Splendid Thing, etc., remember him being so tan and no sunscreen???  anyhow, had never heard of a bond slave and thought this was an atrocity that children were responsible for parental debt, but fairness coupled with prairie life and the incessant threat of those deadly injuns, prolly didn't prioritize well...  kinda confused with spending $18.40 to expunge her debt but she was relegated to a life of servitude and a buncha meanies for life???  not such a good move but will have to check the history books for accuracy on this aspect...  Mitchum was the best suprise with his constant comment on wanting a wife and then glaring at Rachel and hitting on her bigtime, figured he was a dead man after that dress gift surprise...  looked like he could actually play that guitar and enjoyed his vocal arrangements.... hence, a recommend for perhaps a history lesson, hard life on the prairie, and a unique love triangle for the stunning Loretta Young!",1359676800,,1079,4.779569892473118
371236,4,6301766210,"Loretta Young made a lot of good movies, but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, this is my second favorite after, 'The Farmer's Daughter.'
The plot is refreshing: William Holden decides that his homestead needs a woman after his wife dies, both for work, and as a mother figure for his son. Loretta is a bondservant, but because of current standards, Holden marries her - but in name only. The boy, who doesn't want his mother replaced, gives her grief, too.
Until that is, friend of the family, rover Robert Mitchum - pays a visit, and a lot of attention, to Rachel.
I don't like to spoil a good story, but it all works out, and there's enough character development, story, and a little action too, to satisfy most fans. The setting, with the cabin in the woods and the scenery, even though  black & white is pleasant. I like this film a lot.  Let's get this movie on DVD, soon. sloanranger-Wattpad.",1352419200,,914,4.5

Life was hard during those times, with little avilable money, and constant danger from Indians and wild animals.  It drives home the lesson that life is hard, but those who work succeed.  A successful marriage requires respect, cooperation and love.
