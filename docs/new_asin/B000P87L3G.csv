8189826,5,B000P87L3G,"Why oh why oh why has AMC never placed all these episodes on DVD over the past twenty years? It's the perfect show. Back in the day I would devour every episode and hang out in live chats devoted to the show. Then abruptly AMC changed management and the best show ever was abruptly cancelled, leaving us all hanging. Please finally do the right thing and put the whole show on DVD.",1449532800,11,381,4.305555555555555
