8331590,4,B001OTZOZ2,"Good DVD.  Explains Options well.  However, the title menus are all mixed-up.  It opens on Options Strategies 3 which is really Chapter 1; Chapter IV is really Chapter 2, Chapter V is really Chapter 3, Leaps is really Chapter 4, Chapter II is really Chapter 5, and Chapter 1 is really Leaps.  Go figure.  I think the company might have gotten a ""seconds"" batch and sold it as ""new in box"" but did not mention the defective menu.  I can deal with the menu, I just have to keep my notes in my DVD box.  Wish they were more up-front with this.",1405123200,,540,4.235294117647059
