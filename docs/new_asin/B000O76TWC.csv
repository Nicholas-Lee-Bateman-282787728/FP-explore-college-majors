2791595,1,B000O76TWC,"There are a few movies that I've watched that are so bad that I don't bother to finish watching.  ""When Darkness Falls"" was one of them.

Badly written and poorly acted, the thin script and dialog was repeated endlessly for perhaps no reason beyond filling the time.  Characters repeated the same action so often I thought the DVD was stuck or the editor had lapsed consciousness.

I'm told that the second film (The Best of Care) was better, but I had long since exited the show by the time the second ""dose of fright"" came on the screen.

The photography (passable) and the music (atmospheric) were among the best parts of the entire film.  Unfortunately, neither of these more promising elements could make up for the flaws in what was ultimately a waste of plastic.",1181347200,6,769,4.659259259259259
2791596,1,B000O76TWC,"The dialogue was repetitive, the special effects almost non-existent, the actors, though attractive, behaved as though they hadn't been instructed what to do after a certain point and were just maintaining until further notice.  It had potential, being gay myself and a horror fan, I had high hopes for such a film, but I never felt edge of my seat thrills, and there wasn't even one nude scene!  I wouldn't have bought it had I been able to rent it first, and I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money.  I do hope the film makers make another attempt in this genre, but correct these areas when they do.",1179619200,13,608,4.559633027522936
8183382,5,B000O76TWC,This is a Swedish movie with English subtitles that will hold your interest all the way through.  You will be rooting for those you feel for and agree with and getting upset at the ones you don't.  It addresses several very important issues in our society today and several cultural and moral issues as well.  I think you will be glad you watched it.  I was.,1412121600,,358,4.378787878787879
8183383,3,B000O76TWC,So so London film.  A change of pace from his usual type of film.,1411603200,,65,3.642857142857143
8183384,5,B000O76TWC,"If it's an accurate portrayal, I'm surprised to see the the cavalier attitude towards domestic violence in Sweden. Of the three stories, the one with the girls was the most gut-wrenching. I wanted to reach in to the film and bash the mother's head in, while reserving a special treatment for the ""father"". I've no doubt situations like this play out in many parts of the middle east (and of course in Western countries as well), and I just wish I had some special ""alone time"" with these monsters.",1360627200,,497,4.595505617977528
8183385,4,B000O76TWC,"Jeezus, are there places in the world like this?  Is this an exaggeration for shock value?  What year is this, anyway?  Well, it's a very good movie, as movies go.  Parts of it are very intense.  Wow.  There is a healthy amount of violence, so be ready for that.  If I was convinced that this movie was an accurate portrayal of this culture, I would have many things to say, but who really knows?  If it is, then I am very happy that I was born in the U.S.  I make this statement as someone who is not a flag-waver, a my-country-right-or-wrong, fat, spoiled, Wal-Mart-shopping American.  Any-who, I recommend this movie, because, as I said before, it is very, very good.",1350172800,,670,4.462809917355372
8183386,1,B000O76TWC,"Just when I thought gay-themed movies couldn't get any worse, along comes this dreary piece. It is difficult to believe that the filmmakers could have sat through the production process without falling asleep. Unless they were kept awake by laughing at the porn level dialogue. How the Austin Gay International Film Festival could have been bothered with it is astonishing. They must have a very low entry standard.",1302912000,,415,5.117647058823529
8183387,1,B000O76TWC,"When Darkness Falls is such a disappointment on so many levels the act of watching just makes you depressed. You can usually tell in the first 2 minutes if a film is competently made. You may not like it, it may frustrate you, but you can tell that the filmmaker has a gift, no matter how limited the resources. The filmmakers of this double movie DVD had ideas for cheaply made short horror films, but no skill in realizing their vision.

The videography is so washed out and muddy it looks like a fourth generation old VHS tape. The scripts are dull and needlessly verbose, with unlikable characters and actors unable to give any genuine meaning to the lines or actions. There's nothing fun or ""camp"" about any of this. It's not a Plan From Outer Space for gays because there is no sense of style. Scenes just sit there, with excruciating long takes and actors half improvising their trite dialogue with all the mediocre passion their lack of talent can muster.

These shorts look like home movies made by a group of friends to laugh about with each other afterwards. I hope they had fun making it. I am hoping I don't see anything this amateurish again for a while. I need a break.",1289952000,,1184,4.502325581395349
8183388,2,B000O76TWC,"This dvd arrived with excelent time, but this movie to me was very amateur and boring.",1259971200,,86,4.4375
8183389,2,B000O76TWC,"Each movie is worth about one star.  I thought the movie was going to be scary, was I put to sleep. I could not understand the point of all the dialogue in a horror movie. The second movie put me to sleep not what I was expecting.",1199664000,,230,3.893617021276596
8183390,3,B000O76TWC,"There are two gay themed films included.  It is like in the old days at the drive-in movies.

The main feature is ""When Darkness Falls""  I gave it 3 stars. It has hot, shirtless guys, a horror theme, some funny moments and the last five minutes is a nice, horror payoff.  I liked it a lot and a very pleasant surprise. It is about a guy that invites another guy up to his secluded cabin for a weekend amd it turns out much different they either bargained for..  It is funny, sexy and finally scary.

The co-feature is ""The Best of Care"".  A much more serious film about a gay couple when one is forced to take care of the other, who is very ill.  The one can never seem to please his sick mate and wishes for and finally gets his wish of not having to take care of his mate.  Beware of what you wish for. I give this one 2 1/2 stars.",1192233600,2,833,4.0
8183391,1,B000O76TWC,"One of the worst gay films ever, filled with ceaseless and pointless verbal diarrhea which keeps you on the edge of your seat because you will feel so drowsy that you can't sit straight!!!

The first film has two guys talking about stupid stuff for 30 minutes and then shove something that looks vaguely like a negligible whiff of lame horror in the last 30 seconds just to absurdly proclaim itself as a gay horror film.",1183334400,12,420,4.526315789473684
