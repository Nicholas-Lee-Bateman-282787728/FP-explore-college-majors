7808694,5,6300279987,"I owned this tape years ago when I only had a VCR. Somewhere along the way it disappeared. I have a combination VCR/DVD now. This movie, like a lot of other movies, only exists on VCR tapes. When I seen it on Amazon, it brought back memories. While it isn't Academy Award material, I liked it enough that I remembered it and purchased it a second time. I'm sure some people would say it is garbage, but not me. I've seen many Sci-Fi made for TV movies over the years I didn't like. This is one I liked!",1423785600,,502,4.13265306122449
7808695,3,6300279987,"This was a made for TV movie, so it didn't have the super budget of today's sci-fi productions.  Somehow Tom Mason got top billing and plays a rather over-animated doctor investigating UFOs.  He's something like Michael Fox with longer hair.  The aliens want to take over Hoover Dam where Max Gail (alias Sgt. Wojo) strikes them as an ideal human to inhabit.  Max is perfectly cast as a muscular hardhat guy named Russ Garner, and he does a remarkable job of changing from his usual likable self to a rather strange and sinister drone taken over by the aliens.  His eyes turn green when he resorts to mind control and the effect is very well done.  When his battery runs low he has to recharge from an alien power supply.  He plays this rundown craving perfectly, like he's going to die on the spot.  Everyone else is just sort of there, but Max carries the show.  It's worth seeing just for Max and a few laughs at the campy sci-fi trimmings.",1318291200,2,943,4.4678362573099415
7808696,1,6300279987,"Fortunately for humanity, the aliens that attempt to take over our planet match us in stupidity, but I don't want to spoil it for you by telling you who wins. It doesn't matter anyway as you'll be guffawing your way through this mechanical plot. Those aliens sure do have some spooky power to possess human beings with supernatural ease. Yet it avails them little since they fail to adopt any personality to disguise the subterfuge. Just picture it. Your spouse walks in the door home from work and presents no human affect whatsoever. Your completely robotic partner reassures your distressed query as to this blatant psychological disorder with the alarmingly flat response ""everything is fine, everything is okay"". To the benefit of the aliens most humans are too slow and stupid to respond to the obvious body snatching. But there's one guy...",1128297600,2,847,4.971830985915493
