2805440,1,B000OY9V84,"I normally give a movie 2 stars automatically for tasteless nudity, but in the case of this film I'll make an exception.  Anyone who has been stuck in a video game knows the frustration of watching this movie.  With no sense of moving forward at all, the main characters walk around in circles watching people die.  The acting could have been better (there were some good points there, notably the dude at the end).  The sound is unforgivably bad - I actually missed dialog because I couldn't hear the actor.  The budget for this movie should have at least been big enough to include a microphone and HD camera.  Redubs could have been put in using free software tools available to anyone.  The plot has nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft, fear or anything of interest.  I have been very impressed with some indie, low budget films in the past, which makes this one even more of a failure in my eyes.

I hope the crew had fun making the movie, because no one will enjoy watching it.",1213142400,,981,4.466292134831461

2805442,1,B000OY9V84,"I seem to be in a similar position as the other reviewers-- I am a fan of Lovecraft, and I was disappointed to find that this was more of a rendition of Saw than any story by Lovecraft.  Coincidentally, the night before viewing The Tomb, I watched another movie by the same director, Ulli Lommel, called ""Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven"" which also had nothing to do with the poem of the same name.  I wish I had looked at the director before renting this movie!  Both movies are B (or C?) movie quality, have incoherent plots, slow pacing, and leave fans of these turn-of-the-century horror writers feeling used and disappointed.",1198540800,3,626,4.621621621621622
2805443,1,B000OY9V84,"Oh well this is bad.  I mean this is really bad.  I had really hoped that this would be a great horror movie.  I always loved The Tomb story.  A great story, mind you.  A really wonderful story.  I do not know why I rented this really bad movie.  I think that slamming a ball bat against my head would be far more amusing than this silly movie.  No.  Wait. This wasn't a silly movie.  This was an atrocious movie.  One of the sins of this movie is that it has no pace, this movie has no tension, this movie has no characterization.  I watched this movie with hope but it has no hope.  I really think you should not even look at this movie.  Dont rent it.  Dont buy it, definitely.  So many things were wrong with this movie.  They only taped Lovecraft's name to it to make you want to see it.  It has really nothing to do with the original story, nothing to do with Lovecraft's writer's worldview.  A pointless movie.  Should never have been made.",1183593600,11,947,4.184357541899441
2805444,1,B000OY9V84,"Lovecraft is honestly my favorite writer of all time. I don't read it for the Occult aspects (All hail the Old Ones!)  Or because he came up with mythical creations beyond space and time (Cthulhu fhtagn!!). I read Lovecraft for his ideas on what truly is scary.
""The Tomb"" short story is about a MAN who visits his family's tomb only to be confronted by his horrible destiny of his ancestors.
""H.P. Lovecraft's The Tomb"" is about a group of people tortured by a puppet master of sorts. He wears a white mask like face garment, talks through a speaker system, and shows up on a messy TV. Sounds like another movie, it's called ""SAW"". Honestly I didn't like SAW either, but at least the gore was real and the plot was original.
Let us circle around again the Lovecraft name. Lovecraft has maybe 2 or three stories where a woman was involved as a main person. Lovecraft really didn't write about women. So why is there a movie bearing his name that has several of them? One being part of the man focus? That is not Lovecraften!
So back to the whole focus here. This movie has nothing to do with Lovecraft except its title. It is horribly written, badly taped (Are those the same cams they use for COPS?), and bad special effects, there is not a shred of good in the movie.
So run away from it! Stay away! (may Dagon eat you, writers of this movie!)Learn from my mistake, read first, then rent!
And remember just because it says Lovecraft doesn't mean it has anything to do with him!",1183420800,,1479,4.417582417582418
2805445,1,B000OY9V84,"I was never really into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edgar-Allan-Poe/dp/145150506X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, even before I heard ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" way too many times as an oral interp at high school speech meets.  But when I heard Rod Serling talking about how H.P. Lovecraft had written his chilling little tale ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunter-of-the-Dark/dp/B002E19KU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunter of the Dark)</a>"" as something of a joke, repaying Robert Bloch for killing off a Lovecraft character in ""The Shambler of the Stars"" by killing off a character named Robert Blake, I had to check the guy out.  I was soon reading everything by Lovecraft that I could get my hands on and I still remember making the mistake of reading ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-the-Mountains-of-Madness/dp/0812974417/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At the Mountains of Madness</a>"" late one night and then having a lot of trouble getting to sleep.

So when you slap the title ""H.P. Lovecraft's The Tomb"" on a DVD I am going to check it out, even though as a rule the adaptations of Lovecraft's stories have been rather disappointing.  But when I actually watch the movie and discover that it has nothing to do with Lovecraft's short story, does not take place in a tomb, and is really a rip-off of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>"" that should have been entitled ""Ulli Lommel's The Warehouse,"" I get pretty ticked off.  In fact, I want to drive to Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, get my hands on their copy of the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Necronomicon/dp/0892541466/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Necronomicon</a>"" by the ""Mad Arab"" Abdul Alhazred, and bring down the wrath of the Old Ones down on the heads of those responsible for this abomination.  I always maintained that a rating of one-star should be reserved for snuff films or movies where those responsible should be hunted down and dealt with severely.  I guess I finally found a film that fits the bill.

Lovecraft's short story ""The Tomb"" is about Jervas Dudley, who checks out the family tomb and finds an empty coffin with his name on it.  He decides it is a good idea to sleep in the coffin each night and then, as you would expect, bad things happen to him.  In this direct to video 2007 offering, Tara (Victoria Ullmann) wakes up in a warehouse where she is joined by other guests courtesy of the ""Puppetmaster,"" an unseen psychopath with a deep voice who starts tormenting them.  In an effort to justify the title starts dropping names associated with Lovecraft's stories, such as Charles Dexter Ward and David Pickman.  The references purport to be clued, but they end up being gratuitous.  Eventually Tara learns the only rule that matters in this particular little game: the last one alive gets to leave.  Now, that is certainly a premise that can work in a horror film, but did I mention that this one is set in warehouse?  Because it is, and I sort of expected Tara and the others to make an effort to get the hell out of there because they start competing in earnest for the golden ticket out of that ""tomb.""  However, that would make sense.

Consequently this movie is a lot like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>,"" only without the interesting death traps, but with your standard plot twist right out of the tradition of 1970's slasher flicks (always pay attention to back stories as if they were Holy writ in these movies).  Overall this is a very boring horror film.  The most interesting part was when Tara talks to the woman in the box, but that is not really a good sign because horror films are not supposed to come down to two women talking.  Of course, this is a horror movie filled with bad signs, beginning with the title, which is still the biggest insult here.  If this was just a bad rip-off of ""Saw"" that would be one thing: you expect those to be coming out of the walls after the success of that horror trilogy.  But desecrating the name of H.P. Lovecraft is totally unforgivable.  The only way fans of Lovecraft or horror movies are going to check out this film is by mistake.",1183075200,34,4465,5.495614035087719
2805446,1,B000OY9V84,"I rented this from my local video store. I am a horror movie fan; I even ocassionally enjoy cheesy predictable horror movies if they have some redeeming aspect. ""The Tomb"" has none.  The production quality of this movie is awful.  It is like an 80's porn flick (not that I have seen one, lol). The music is equally awful. The acting is awful. The plot (and  I use that term lighlty) is awful and, as far as I can tell, is a direct rip-off of the ""Saw"" movies. Frankly, I couldn't bear to watch it after about 20 minutes and I turned it off. It appeared it would be quite gory from the few minutes that I watched but what is gore without anything else to support it? Boring. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1182211200,22,704,4.2

This film details the discovery and contents of the tomb of Tutankhamen, perhaps the most famous of the Egyptian pharaohs. The film covers the details of the find, and discusses the way in which the tomb was laid out.  Most impressive, however, are the beautiful shots of the tomb, of the three gold sarcophagi, and of the various other adornments which were found along with the mummy.  This is a great documentary about Egypt, and a good use of a half-hour.",1061769600,7,594,4.5233644859813085

This is a bad movie. There is nothing redeeming to say about this movie. In fact, putting it in a category with other ""movies"" does a disservice to the term.

I'd have given it fewer stars but apparently Amazon doesn't want to let me give it a 0-star review. As others have already covered, it has nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft aside from the constant name-checking. There's also no tomb. To be honest, I'm not really even sure what I watched; the ending is fairly incomprehensible. I guess it's sort of like Saw, without any traps or coherent storytelling or anything interesting happening. Please don't waste your time on this.",1412467200,,714,4.796747967479675
2805452,2,B000OY9V84,"Have you ever seen a movie that made you want to fill your ears with super glue and gouge your eyes out with an ice pick? If so, and you are in fact deaf and blind, I would definitely recommend purchasing ""The Tomb"" through Amazon Instant Video.

""The Tomb"" begins in a large warehouse where an unknown villain has left a collection of victims in varying states of injury, to piece together his mysterious identity. This evil ring leader relays messages to the two main characters, a pretty, talentless blonde and an overweight bald dude reminiscent of 'Kyle Gas,' through tape and video recordings. He goes by the alias ""Puppetmaster"" and watches his victims struggle via closed circuit surveillance. Sound familiar? Oh yeah, and there's a really creepy animatronic doll, although it just seems to be one of an endless amount of props set around the warehouse, with no purpose other than to distract you from the unbelievably bad acting and paper mache gore, and to help stretch a 30 minute ""Saw""rip off into a full length feature.

In case you're not too keen on subtle sarcasm, ""The Tomb"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot since I've seen every film ever made by Wes Craven. However, despite this movie being a near perfect representation of the worst of the worst in B horror flicks, notice that I have not said that it is the worst I have ever seen, and that's because this movie does break away from the ""Saw"" path when the heroine escapes the warehouse and is given a car, a buttload of cash, and a manuscript. If you think that's a pretty surprising twist, wait 'til you find out that the maniac tracks down his only surviving victim to give her an ultimatum: Have sex with me or I take the goods back. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened had the 'Kyle Gas' character survived...

I really have no problem giving this movie a 2/5 stars due to it's slow pace and overall amateur feeling, however one should keep in mind I would have rated it a 1 had it not been for the refreshingly original ending.",1411516800,,2053,4.528301886792453

This movie is like a high-school film class's ripoff of ""Saw"", except without the somewhat-creative deaths.  People inside coffins spontaneously appear and usually end up just croaking within five minutes.  There was one scene where a guy was literally jogging in place on a beach.  The ""tomb"" where they are imprisoned literally looks like a warehouse from a Halloween novelty shop.  There are Halloween store-caliber props everywhere.  Like another poster mentioned, too, it keeps showing their captor moving around above them because the ceiling of the ""tomb"" is made of slats and there is probably nothing stopping the people from breaking through and getting out.

I love horror movies and I am very forgiving of low production values, but this one was just too much for words.  It also didn't help that I couldn't hear what the actors were saying half the time (which I suppose was a blessing in disguise) and it was just plain boring.  Basically it was a man and a woman wandering around this basement and every once in a while the guy above them would drop little pieces of paper down through the floor/basement ceiling that had ""clues"" written on them.  Also, it is riddled with ""flashbacks"" that are supposed to show how the people had connections to the guy who kidnapped them, but by the time you get to those parts in the movie you probably won't care anyway.
