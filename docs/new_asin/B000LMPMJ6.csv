8162370,5,B000LMPMJ6,it is a originally shot from tamil then dubbed into hindi version. my favorite actress keerthi Reddy acted in this movie. one song I liked most from this movie. and some comedy was presented by vivek that was his best comedy I had seen. all the way it's memory of 1998,1432166400,,268,4.2745098039215685
8162371,3,B000LMPMJ6,"Johnny (Prabhu Deva) is a much adored rowdy with a knack for comic mischief.  When he's not crashing cricket matches, stealing police cars, or having brawls in the streets, he's likely dancing it up with his friends.  An astrologer that seemingly lets his bird do all the work for him, tells Johnny's mother that he will marry an affluent girl.  Enter Sandhya (Kirti Reddy) who encounters Johnny during a highway melee with her entourage.  Impressed by him, she seeks him and it seems like the prediction will come true.  That is, until she tells Johnny that he is her best friend and asks him to choose her husband.

This movie starts out fun with the antics of Johnny and his gang versus the dreadful Sala who leads their rivals.  Vivek does well playing a foppish upper class man who is after Sandhya as well.  After the revelation the movie takes a brutally somber path until its unfortunate climax.  As far as it goes, the songs aren't all that great, and the dance routines do little to showcase Prabhu Deva's talent.  Also the film is dubbed in Hindi, and his other fan's may find the goofy voice they gave him a little irritating.  All in all its a decent film, and don't you want to find out hoe he will get out of this one?  LoL.",1245369600,,1239,4.457777777777777
8162372,3,B000LMPMJ6,"This movie has the same stars as the youtube viral video ""Benny Lava"" by Mike Sutton (youtube user Buffalax).  Prabhu Deva, the male lead, is considered the ""Michael Jackson of Bollywood"".  It's got similar fast and catchy dance numbers -- and would be great for ""buffalaxing"" or ""soramimi"", which is translating a foreign language based upon what you think you hear in English regardless of the actual language.  As far as I can find (2/2009), the original movie, ""Pennin Manathai Thottu"", and song, ""Kalluri Vaanil"", are not available on dvd at this time.  Lets hope that the distributor gets it transferred to DVD soon!  I would love to have a copy.

The DVD transfer has quite a bit of snow and other static with occassional heavy pixelation.  Looks like a direct VHS to DVD with little cleanup.  Sound is OK.  There are English subtitles for those who want to know what they are really saying.  There is also a special feature to show only the songs sections of the movie.",1235088000,2,977,4.694117647058824
