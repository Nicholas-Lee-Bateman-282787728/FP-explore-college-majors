638503,3,630335906X,"With a nod to western classic Duel in the Sun and opening like Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood in Two Mules for Sister Sara, serape wrapped Man With No Name Tab Hunter meets stranded femme Divine in the wild west in Paul Bartel's LUST IN THE DUST.  It promises something special indeed until it forsakes its satiric ambitions somewhere in the middle of act one and settles down to chew its way through an unspectacular plot.

  By the time this odd couple make it to the small town of Chile Verde and become entwined in the search for a hidden cache of gold, LUST has turned into an edgeless comedy, the tedium relieved only when Divine and Lainie Kazan (Marguerita Ventura) sing or spat, or when Hard Case Williams (veteran actor Geoffrey Lewis) squints and spouts intimidating Bible quotes.  Unfortunately, producer Tab Hunter hired actor Tab Hunter to play lead Abel Wood.  Hunter is simply too laid-back to be thrown into the middle of a parody.

  LUST IN THE DUST had many of the ingredients to be a first-class spoof, worthy to be filed along with movies like Blazing Saddles and Paint Your Wagon.  Although it has its moments, in the ends it's simply a  silly and inconsequential western parody.",1105401600,9,1207,4.7

Miss Kazan, one of moviedoms most underrated comedic actress', shines with her usual brilliance. Definately one of my personal top ten rated comedy pictures of all time. Which means it's right up there with ""Some Like it Hot"" ""Dinner at Eight"" and ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"".",1083801600,21,545,4.571428571428571

638506,1,630335906X,"Awful spoof of spaghetti westerns from Paul Bartel, director/ star of the cult black comedy EATING RAOUL.
At the beginning of the movie the narrator says ""Those who lust in the dust, shall die in the dust"". If only Divine had dropped dead in his/her first frame. If that isn't bad enough, not four minutes into the picture viewers are subjected to a Divine naked-butt shot. I thought I had a pretty strong stomach, being a fan of movies like BLOODSUCKING FREAKS and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but this was disturbing!
The plot- Divine has half a treasure map tattooed on that scary tuckus of hers/his. So she and Tab Hunter set out across the desert to find the other half of the map so Divine can fulfill his/her dream of becoming a singer when they locate the booty(bad choice of word). Will viewers be spared another gratuitous not-so divine rump flashing? Is this REALLY the comedy-western to end all comedy-westerns? Not just that- LUST IN THE DUST nearly killed westerns, period. Luckily seven years later along came UNFORGIVEN; which is how the makers of this picture should remain. The talents of Lainie Kazan, Henry Silva and Caesar Romero are wasted. Do yourself a favor and check out EATING RAOUL instead.",1034380800,4,1211,4.716981132075472
638507,5,630335906X,"Critics be damned. I love this movie. Paul Bartel directed two of my favorite 80's comedies---""Eating Raoul"" and this. Only Bartel could have put together a cast like this in a western satire and get away with it. Lainie Kazan (a much underrated actress with fantastic comedy skills) and Divine are a perfect match for a hellcat-take-all catfight. ""You're cheap!"" snarls Kazan at Divine. ""Cheap!?"" shrieks Divine. ""This FURNITURE""S cheap!"" as she cracks a chair over Kazan's head. Oh, but there is much more going on here. Great location shooting, Tab Hunter as an Eastwood-type mystery drifter, two completely TASTELESS ""show-stopper"" style saloon numbers -one by Divine and one by Kazan, Cesar Romero as a deranged priest, the wonderful Nedra Volz as ""Big Ed"" and a host of other top-notch supporting players all rollicking and frolicking their way through this funny,funny movie. As I said, critics may have hated it but I recommend it for Bartel/Divine/Kazan/Hunter fans. The title was supposedly a play on the old western trash classic ""Duel In The Sun""!",1034294400,7,1059,5.127167630057803
638508,5,630335906X,"""Lust in the Dust"" is a low-brow comedy, directed by the masterful Paul Bartel (""Eating Raoul""), and stars Tab Hunter as the quiet gunfighter travelling to Chile Verde, NM, in search of buried gold.  Rosie Velez, a refugee from a Sante Fe dance hall, played with great talent and humor by the late cross-dressing film star of the John Waters school Divine, joins him en route.  Once in Chile Verde, they meet a kooky assortment of characters: Marguerita (Lainie Kazan), the owner of the town's local saloon/brothel, an insane priest played by Cesar Romero, an eighty year-old prostitute (Nedra Volz), and the leader of a gang of outlaws named Hardcase Williams (Geoffrey Lewis), among others.  After a series of silly, sexual misadventures and a couple of great songs by our two lovely leading ladies, the cast tries desperately to solve a limerick and find a missing treasure map.  Who will get the gold?  (""Did I say 'gold'?  I meant 'mold'"").  Well, you'll just have to watch and find out.  This silly spoof is presented on DVD in sweeping 2.35:1 aspect ratio widescreen and bright vivid colors (both of which the VHS lacks), reminiscent of the 1950s Technicolor/Cinemascope westerns it's spoofing. The best scene by far is the barroom brawl between Divine and Lainie--that scene alone makes this film worth watching. There is also a nicely done ""making-of"" featurette and the trailer.  This movie is not for everyone, but if you're in the mood for a lightweight film with some good raunchy laughs, you should give this one a try.",1034208000,4,1533,4.888030888030888

The movie is just not very funny.  Paul Bartel won my admiration with ""Eating Raoul"", so I was thinking a movie with my favorite drag queen directed by Paul Bartel was sure to have plenty of laughs.  I was sorely disappointed by the experience.  The comic highlight is Divine's singing bit, but everything else is sub-par.

I just purchased the DVD edition of this film and was pleasantly surprised by the packaging and information on this disk. The menus are adorned with huge, scary close-ups of Divine's face with the Lust in the Dust theme song playing over the menu selections. It's pretty great!  But, best of all, is the 16 minute featurette, More Lust Less Dust which features interviews with stars Tab Hunter and Lainie Kazan as well as other people related with the project. They talk about the fun atmosphere and location shooting (highlighted with stills and home movies) and feature many rare images of Divine and Bartel. The most interesting aspect in the documentary was the discussion of how they wanted to keep the film from being a ""John Waters film without John Waters"" and the very surprising footage of Edith Massey's screen test for the film! Ultimately, she wasn't used.

638577,3,630335906X,"I recently watched a documentary about Divine, ""I Am Divine"", and then the Tab Hunter documentary on Netflix, ""Tab Hunter Confidential."" Both documentaries reference this filim, ""Lust in the Dust,"" and I knew I had to watch it. Thankfully it is available for digital rental on Amazon Video. It's only available in SD, which was a little off putting as I'm spoiled and used to watching HD only, but the quality wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. It's much better video quality than the preview Amazon has available. If you're hesitant about renting because of the SD format, don't let that stop you.

As to the movie itself, it's ok. It's a spoof on Westerns but I only wanted to watch it to see Divine & Tab Hunter reunited on the screen. Lainie Kazan steals the show, and it was a delight to watch her in this film as she's clearly having a good time. Divine's performance is a bit subdued compared to what she usually delivers in John Waters films, but this may also be a result of splitting the screen time between the three stars.

There are a couple moments that made me laugh but it's not a riot by any means. It's a solid B movie. It would have been nice to see the three leads get more screen time and less time devoted to the minor characters.",1466294400,,1253,4.396551724137931

Plus Tab hunter co-stars in List in the Dust with Divine, and they of course worked together in 1981's Polyester.

638715,5,630335906X,"The improbable pairing of Tab Hunter and Divine (both on and off screen) plus a plot that resembles British farce or one of the better Carry On films set in a dirt poor back water of the truly ""wild"" West delivers great entertainment and memorable performances.

Divine really gives as good as she gets in this film which she literally at some points straddles. The monologue with the donkey and the shower scenes are my personal favourites. But every minute brings a fresh bellyful of laughs - take the saloon brawl - a high point of any 1950s 1960s B movie western which for sheer energy rivals any of those and is 100% spoof. Lee Marvin or John Wayne going at it in Donovan's Reef, or for that matter even the lip biting gung-ho punch up featuring Randolph Scott in Carson City, seem dull by comparison. Of course there is no room for any dignity or sense of decorum in this film. Everything is pieces scattered on the floor. And it's a refreshing and resourceful escapade for that. Even an antidote.

The central thesis of a matching half of a treasure map tattooed on the cheek of another ass and the competitive hot pursuit it creates (the sweet road to success one might say) could also stand for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and the American dream.

Even social comment is covered in this wonderful film.",1416614400,,1325,4.4896265560165975

With its dry vulgar humor this would be more of a miss than a hit to those who just don't understand.
If you can handle raunch then you'll have no problem watching John's work.
The more you attempt to understand John Waters creative mind (and I am sure most never will) the more you will appreciate his direction and twisted plots.

638784,2,630335906X,"LUST IN THE DUST aspires to be a Western spoof, but the fact is that it's just not that funny. Divine plays Rosie Velez, a former dancehall girl who embarks on a journey to Chili Verde. Along the way she meets Abel Wood (Tab Hunter), a mostly silent gunman who is clearly meant to be a parody of Clint Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" character. The first half-hour of the movie is ok and had some good one-liners, but once the plot kicked in the movie got really boring and hokey. The drive for the plot is a stash of gold hidden somewhere near Chili Verde, and people have been looking for it a long time. Also included in the mix is an outlaw gang and a ""cantina"" owned by Marguerita Ventura. All of these people are after it, and all they have to go on is a limerick that's been passed down for 30 some-odd years. Despite the obvious flaws, there were some positive elements be had. Among them are Divine, who does play a more subdued character than usual, but still gives an interesting performance. There was also a small role early on with Henry Silva playing a Mexican, although the humor derived from him was mostly due to the ridiculous accent he puts on. There was also a couple of songs, each sung by one of the leading ladies. Other than that, the movie was a mess plot-wise, and the ending was entirely too convoluted and drawn out. It's a shame that Divine didn't live longer because it was at this point that she really came into her own as a (semi-)serious actor. The material she was given to work with wasn't too great, but it's worth at least one viewing for her fans. For everyone else, it probably isn't worth your time.",1402963200,,1639,4.359477124183006

639064,5,630335906X,"Lust In The Dust is an excellent spoof of western films with plenty of laughs and great entertainment. Many people mistakenly believe that this is a John Waters movie; it is not. Tab Hunter was one of the producers and he plays tough, mysterious gunfighter Able Wood as well.

But already I am getting somewhat ahead of myself. The action actually begins when we see Rosie Velez (Divine) struggling in the heat of the desert with her mule as she tries to get to Chile Verde in New Mexico. Soon she meets up with a rough and tough silent type cowboy who turns out to be the very famous Able Wood; and together they enter Chile Verde.

Rosie wants a job as a singer at the only saloon in town owned by Marguerita Ventura (Lainie Kazan); and the catfights start right from the word go as Rosie and Marguerita don't exactly get along. Sure, Rosie gets a job--scrubbing floors in the saloon, that is! Meanwhile, Able turns out to be in Chile Verde to find the long lost gold treasure allegedly buried there. Although the town's priest (Cesar Romero) denies that the gold treasure actually exists, soon almost everyone in town reveals that they are really there just to find the hidden gold treasure.

Of course there are many laughs along the way. Rosie sings a hilarious song as she auditions to sing in Marguerita's saloon; and Able spars with Hard Case Williams (Geoffrey Lewis), a rough and tough man himself--who is always quoting intimidating passages from the Bible. We get fight scenes and the inevitable race for the gold.

It may seem like I gave it all away; but I really didn't. Look for some very funny scenes with the piano bar player Red Barker (Courtney Gains) and the race for the gold treasure could make any one of several characters--or more than one person--very rich fast. Even after the treasure might actually be found, what happens to Rosie, Able, Marguerita, the town's priest--and the others?

The choreography works really well in the fight scenes; and the cinematography gives us great widescreen shots of the New Mexican desert.  Excellent!

The DVD extras include a fifteen minute featurette with Tab Hunter and others telling the story of how this movie came to be a reality; and we get quite a bit of rare bonus footage of people like Edith Massey auditioning for the role of one of the ""women of the night"" in Marguerita's saloon.

Overall, Lust In The Dust is great entertainment that not enough people take the time to watch. It's fun, hilarious and even better if you've seen a few westerns in your time. It's also based on Duel In The Sun; and many people who remember Duel In The Sun will appreciate the parody of that movie's ending at the end of Lust In The Dust.

I highly recommend Lust In The Dust for people who like movies that spoof westerns; and people who like campy, over the top entertainment will cherish this film for ages to come. With a cast including Divine, Lainie Kazan, Tab Hunter, Cesar Romero and more you just can't miss.

Enjoy!",1192665600,9,2986,4.6169811320754715
639065,4,630335906X,"Divine, the alter ego of Glen Milstead (1945-1988), first burst onto an unsuspecting public with such notorious John Waters films as the infamous PINK FLAMINGOS, dishing up bad-taste humor in proportion with her truly ample size.  But there was more to Divine than drag queen humor, and LUST IN THE DUST offers her a less extreme playground, pitting her against a lone gunman (Tab Hunter), a vicious saloon floozie (Lainie Kazan), and a host of desperados in a flyweight send up the spaghetti westerns so popular in the 1970s and 1980s.

Directed by Paul Bartel, best known for his 1982 black comedy EATING RAOUL, LUST IN THE DUST is essentially the very slight story of a search for gold--a search that leads Able Wood (Hunter), Marguarite Ventura (Kazan), and  Rosie Velez (Divine) to the isolated old west one horse town of Chile Verde.  There, with support from the likes of Cesar Romero, they snap, snarl, break up furniture, sing bawdy songs, show their tatoos, and... well... lust in the dust.  What else?

I may be overly generous in granting this film four stars.  The film is occasionally slow and there's nothing greatly inspired about plot, script, and so on--but the performers make the whole thing a lot of fun.  Divine wallows, Kazan hisses, and Hunter sweats with the best of 'em, and when it comes to one-liners the movie overflows with both the obvious and very unexpected.  Yes, it's all very silly stuff, but everybody puts it over with flair and a sense of fun; you'll grin in spite of yourself.  The DVD offers a reasonable, if not pristine, print of the film--and there's even a bonus package: the film trailer and an entertaining little ""making of"" documentary.

If you're already a Divine fan, LUST IN THE DUST is a must; if you've never encountered Divine, this would be a good place to start, for it lacks the truly jaw-dropping (and frequently off-putting) content of Divine's work for John Waters.  Two tons of big fun!

639069,1,630335906X,"'Lust in the Dust' released in '84 is an irreverent parody on spaghetti westerns that just doesn't hit the target. I did enjoy Tab Hunter doing his best Clint Eastwood impersonation in the role of gunfighter/drifter Abel Wood and Gina Gallego was a lovely addition as working girl Ninfa, however that is the extent of anything positive I have to say about this film. I'm not a prude by any means and can on occasion enjoy low brow humour as well as the next guy but this movie couldn't ellicit as much as one laugh out of me.

Lesson for Today: Irreverent and crude doesn't necessarily translate into funny and entertaining. For Divine fans only.",1158624000,2,646,4.6173913043478265

639072,3,630335906X,"On the road to Chili Verde Divine hooks up with Tab Hunter, once there they learn of the legend of the gold.  Guns fights, cat fights and sexual hijinks follow but it's all too tame.  The first 15 minutes are fine with Divine swimming bottomless then wearing out four rapists, but soon the focus of the film drifts away from the campy stuff and goes more about the story of the lost gold.  Who cares about the gold?!  I want to see Divine half-naked and singing and eating pie underwater and maybe biting a midget on the foot, not searching for gold.

I respect Paul Bartel, but I think John Waters would have been better for this movie.  Yea, I know he turned down the job but that doesn't change the fact he probably would have made a better film.  At least it would have been cruder and campier and that's what we want right?

Also Gina Gallego didn't have a big enough role.",1139011200,10,878,4.310975609756097
