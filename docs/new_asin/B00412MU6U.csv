8412518,5,B00412MU6U,"I really liked this movie!!! Adrien B portraited a beautifully Manolete and Penlope C was good as Lupe Sino. This is basically a love story of two individuals in the poorest and backward country of Europe of the mid-forties (Spain). Unfortunately they were not understood and thus, the tragic ending!!!!",1473552000,,303,5.08
8412519,4,B00412MU6U,A LITTLE TEDIOUS BUT A GOOD ACCOUNT OF A SMALL PART OF THE MAN'S LIFE,1472083200,,69,3.6666666666666665
8412520,2,B00412MU6U,"Disappointed as a historian of the great matador,
""Manolete""...only one very short video coverage
in black and white, of actual footage of the great
Manolete in action...but that was exciting. Anyone
interested in the famous ""Miura"" bulls of Spain
would better enjoy the DVD ""Blood And Sand...the
best footage of those massive Bulls I have seen.",1429833600,,345,5.178571428571429

8412522,5,B00412MU6U,"Manolete was a great bullfighter...I saw him when I was a child, and remember his elegance in the ring. This movie captures some of that....",1368748800,2,140,4.64
