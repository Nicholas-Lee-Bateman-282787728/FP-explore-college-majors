Once again, Mr Maddy does not disappoint. Before you even watch the film, the inner cover and cd art is amazing. This time around, we get to see his luxuriously green backyard with cameos of his cute dog. Then we head over to the Potomac river where we get to see some nice shots of the Washington and Jefferson Memorials. We even get taken in to part of the Jefferson Memorial. Then we are whisked away deep into a park where we get to see an awe-inspiring waterfall. I would watch an hour of just that waterfall. And of course, what is a Maddy Venture without the Boos? Great movie I'd recommend to any fan of the DC area.",1395360000,,687,4.292307692307692

8417702,5,B002SIA746,"What I love most about Mr Maddy's films is that you don't feel like a tourist riding around in a big bus. You feel as if you're experiencing what the people who live there do. When the Producer takes the camera with him during his commutes and drives, it's like you're getting to see what most other visitors don't. You get to see how the city really is to the people that are there every day. This disc shows his backyard in all of it's green glory, as well as city and Potomac shots. It won't leave you disappointed, but perhaps craving more of the Producer's unique insight and style of capturing the day to day life of a Mid Atlantic and DC resident.",1394323200,,654,4.282258064516129
