6684163,5,B00NX6HZZG,"If you thought Whitney's voice on records was spectacular you will be awe struck by the emotion, power and nuance she brought to her live performances.  I wasn't going to purchase this, because I have most of her albums, but I am beyond glad that I made this purchase.",1418256000,5,268,4.469387755102041

6684165,5,B00NX6HZZG,"I loved watching this. Whitney truly was blessed with the greatest voice and was such a dynamic performer. The picture quality is flawless. My only negative is that I selfishly didn't want the video to end. This IMO is an excellent ""Greatest live PART 1"".",1416268800,8,255,4.688888888888889

8680927,3,B00NX6HZZG,"I bout this for this live version of THE GREATEST LOVE OF ALL which in my opinion is her best version ever....there are several questionable selections and omissions in the collection but still, if you were a fan it will bring back MOST of the good memories...The worst omission is her stunning live version of DIDN'T WE ALMOST HAVE IT ALL...how or why they left that off of this set is beyond me!",1472256000,,397,4.4520547945205475

8680929,4,B00NX6HZZG,"Love her. The only way this video could be better is if you could skip through to each song. Instead the video is set up like a 1+ hr ""movie"" of the performances. If i could i would put her performance of ""The greatest love of all"" on repeat! Best example of her vocal strength ",1461456000,,278,4.054545454545455
8680930,4,B00NX6HZZG,There is no doubt that Whitney Houston in her prime was artistitcally a phenomenon. From 1985-1994 in spite of a few flaws she was a powerhouse dynamic live perfromer with a voice that had power emotion and moved me. This is a near excellent representation of her voice over nearly 25 years of her career.,1450569600,,305,4.5636363636363635
8680931,5,B00NX6HZZG,"There are no words that can express the loss of one of the greatest female vocalist in our life time. If some people can get pass the difficulties she struggled with, and her down fall, and her frailty as a human being.....this CD/DVD is a master piece of a musical icon that will endure for generations to come.....from beginning to end you will see the evolving talent of a Super Star from the infancy of her career.....to the multi Grammy winner power house she has become. It's an incredible display of raw talent, exceptional vocal skills, powerful live performances that are truly addicting and awe inspiring. If you love this artist and can see beyond her tragic ending, her addictions and her human struggles....you will not regret this purchase...after all, we are talking about Whiteny Houston- The Voice!",1439337600,,815,4.913043478260869
