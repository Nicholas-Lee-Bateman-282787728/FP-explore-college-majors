8465804,5,B000V01BWU,This is a spikin' movie to all kids between the ages of 6 and 12.  It teaches great morals and helps kids not be afraid to try things that they think they can't do.  It also mirrors the story of David and Goliath from the Bible and Mickey Rooney was supposedly the stone that David threw at Goliath all those years ago.
