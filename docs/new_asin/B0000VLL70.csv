8003794,1,B0000VLL70,"Susan Bier is a very famous director, but everything is wrong with this one. The copy is really poor and the actors are ugly. It could have been poetic, but nothing works. Ugly home. ugly wife, the kids are depressed, ugly job, ugly vacation spot. Suicide perhaps?
This film is not pornographic, but I would like to warn viewers, that for incomprehensible reasons, after the movie ends an awful selection of pornographic films are being advertised.",1437523200,,448,4.907894736842105
8003795,4,B0000VLL70,"I bought LIKE IT NEVER WAS BEFORE from Amazon a few years ago and watch it now and then, always with pleasure.  The film perfectly captures the spirit of a summer holiday by the sea in a nordic country.  The family portrayed is perfectly credible, the actors are quite good, and the story is sensitively told.  I cannot understand how people cannot warm up to a film such as this.  This is a fine effort by a young filmmaker who has gone on to make excellent films.",1373328000,,465,4.310344827586207
8003796,2,B0000VLL70,"Odd Swedish film about middle-aged husband (Loa Falkman) trapped in an unhappy marriage and a dead-end job, who takes his family to a seaside resort.  There he meets and is captivated by a mysterious, free-spirited young man (Simon Norrthon).

This is apparently a movie made for television in the mid-90's.  But it looks and feels like something from the mid-70's, with poor production values.

This is one of those movies I wanted very much to like.  The story is intriguing.  (Is the young man really human or some sort of supernatural being?)  Unfortunately the script doesn't do the idea justice.  But an even bigger problem is the main character.  As played by Falkman, he is completely uninteresting and unimpressive.

The best thing (and maybe the only really good thing) about the movie is the presence of Norrthon as the enigmatic young man.  It is easy to see why anyone--male or female--would become besotted by such an unconventional, handsome young man.  But why he would be infatuated with Falkman is incomprehensible.  Unless, of course, he is some sort of incarnate spirit sent to teach the man to be bold enough to seize life and find happiness before it is too late.

Lifeless and unimaginative, with a better script and better actors (or at least better characters), this one could have been a winner. As it is it gets a couple of stars for Norrthon's performance.  Too bad.",1321660800,2,1394,4.8474576271186445

8003798,3,B0000VLL70,A touching drama about a family who visits a beach resort.  The father (Rune Runeberg) is suffering from mid life crisis and becomes enchanted by a young employee of the resort who later awakens emotions that the father never really explored.  The resulting friendship threatens to alienate the family. This film is an enchanting and disturbing look at freespirited adolescence and male mid life crisis. Guaranteed to be enjoyed by all.,982281600,14,436,5.126760563380282
