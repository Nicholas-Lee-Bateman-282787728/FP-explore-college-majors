8075450,4,B000A7DVU4,"Both of these movies are great. The shipping was good and the DVD functioned well with no problems. I love old scary movies, so if you like old scary movies, you will like this.",1361491200,,177,4.235294117647059
8075451,2,B000A7DVU4,"Both movies need computer graphic corrections.  The first movie, Ghost of Hanley House, old-fashioned, very simplistic storyline with holes, acting is not Oscar level but was a job for people. Oddest part of the movie was that the sound effects sounded at times, too real even compared to today's standards.

Bela Lagosi movie (forgot the title (hint)) needs extensive visual repair, could not discern all of the low budget imagery. Storyline was shaky but visuals made it hard to give this movie better commentary.

Curiousity of special effects, story, and sets of the moviemaking time period, were the reasons for purchase.",1285891200,,626,5.178217821782178
