8233939,3,B000YQUXMK,"This documentary from the Office of War gives an overview of the political and military situation before and during the invasion of the Philippines. Was Truman's decision to allow MacArthur's invasion of the Philippines more costly than an invasion of Formosa? For those at Santo Tomas internment camp (Manila) and the survivors of Japanese POW camps, the answer would have been a definite yes. The invasion of  Leyte  was costly for the military and the Battle of Leyte Gulf effectively ended Japanese naval power. Certainly not an in depth presentation but good for beginners and those who want a quick introduction. The original footage includes a clip from the Japanese military and the narration is accurate. Remember that a 26 minute part of a series can only offer limited information.
