8277037,2,B001AD6UJ6,"The Dude Bandit, 1933 film

It begins with a herd of cattle in a valley. There is a ""Quarantine Notice"" that prohibits all persons. Is this a scheme to oppress small ranchers? If the cattle can't be sold debts can't be repaid and a ranch will be repossessed as security for a debt. [Note that pot-belly stove in the hotel room.] Burton plans to get every ranch in the valley. There is a sound of a shot from a hotel room! Dad Mason had a gun in his hand, there is a note. Elsewhere a cowboy tries to break a bronco. Ace returns from up North, he will investigate the death of Dad Mason. Mason borrowed thousands to repay his debt. Burton shows up to claim Mason's ranch and all its contents. ""Tex"" leaves by the window and rides after Burton's gang. Skeeter talks to Burton, who tells of is plans. Burton's men are told of the holdup. There is a chase (for action)! Skeeter hides. ""Tex"" returns home to get into bed.

Skeeter tells about finding a center-fire shell in a rimfire revolver! Something funny going on. ""Tex"" is very polite. He takes extra pancakes at breakfast. The Dude Bandit rides again! Burton's gang follows him to the Mason ranch. There is subtle comedy in the search of the house. [Would a real ranch house have such a big bedroom? ""Tex"" now has a bullet from Burton's revolver. He finds a new use for that trunk. Skeeter digs out that bullet from Burton's gun; the rifling on the bullets are the same. Ace investigates the ashes in the stove - he finds a rimfire shell. Ace Cooper visits the Sheriff. Betty Mason is told of a plan to save their cattle. Hank Perkins squeals - for a price. Burton learns this and makes a counter-plan. Skeeter questions the Doctor, the Dude Bandit appears! The Doc tells about the plan, Skeeter rides to warn Betty Mason. Skeeter uses his head, Ace uses his lariat.

That man tells Burton did it! Burton and his men ride towards Betty Mason and Mr. Brown. They are distracted by the Dude Bandit. There will be a happy ending. [The word ""dude"" was derived from the word ""duds"" for clothes. A dude was a well-dressed man, unlike real working cowboys.] Most cartridges today use the modern center-fire design, only the .22 continues with the older rimfire design. The Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming inspired many western movies. Note how Hoot tied up his horse instead of just looping the reins over a fence.

This is a good story but this movie has poor quality video and suffers from its lower budget. ""Hoot Owl"" Gibson was a real cowboy hired as an extra then became an actor (with a toothy smile). This is worth viewing as an example of the movies that entertained millions in olden times. Note the use of circumstantial evidence to solve a crime.",1405382400,,2705,4.491869918699187
8277038,5,B001AD6UJ6,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""THE DUDE BANDIT"" (6 April 1933) (66 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Born Edmund Richard Gibson in Tekamah, Nebraska, he learned to ride a horse while still a very young boy --- His family moved to California when he was seven years old --- As a teenager he worked with horses on a ranch, which led to competition on bucking broncos at area rodeos --- Given the nickname ""Hoot Owl"" by co-workers, the name evolved to just ""Hoot"" --- In 1910, film director Francis Boggs was looking for experienced cowboys to appear in his silent film short, ""Pride of the Range"" --- Gibson and another future star of Western films, Tom Mix, were hired --- Hoot made a second film for Boggs in 1911 --- After the director was killed by a deranged employee, Gibson was hired by director Jack Conway to appear in his 1912 Western, ""His Only Son"" --- Acting for Gibson was then a minor sideline and he continued competing in rodeos to make a living --- In 1912 he won the all-around championship at the famous Pendleton Round-Up in Pendleton, Oregon and the steer roping World Championship at the Calgary Stampede.

Gibson's career was temporarily interrupted with service in the United States Army during World War I --- When the war ended, he returned to the rodeo business and became good friends with Art Acord, a fellow cowboy and movie actor --- The two participated in summer rodeo then went back to Hollywood for the winter to do stunt work --- For several years, Gibson had secondary film roles (primarily in Westerns) with stars such as Harry Carey --- By 1921 the demand for cowboy pictures was so great that Gibson began receiving offers for leading roles --- Some of these offers came from up-and-coming film director John Ford, with whom Gibson developed a lasting friendship and working relationship ---

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hoot Gibson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street --- In 1979, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Our story line and plot, Ace Cooper (Hoot Gibson) arrives to investigate what looks like a suicide is actually a murder --- Al Burton (Hooper Atchley) kills Dad Mason (Gordon De Main) and makes it look like a suicide --- Hoot poses as a coward during the day but at night he becomes the daring Dude Bandit --- Must point out Hoot was a ""real Cowboy"" and had been a rodeo rider --- He acted in 218 movies and directed 9 films --- We admire his genuine honesty and natural sense of humor --- Hoot had his greatest popularity in the 1920's --- Hoot is older, he was 42 and not as agile in ""The Dude Bandit"" --- But to us, his fans and just plain folks Hoot is still great and we get lots of enjoyment from this oater --- As he had so many times before, Hoot Gibson pretended to be a dimwit, so in this sagebrush if it worked before why change now.
