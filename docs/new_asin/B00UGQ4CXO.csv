8706683,5,B00UGQ4CXO,I wish this film didn't continue to hit home & always bring tears...having done that in the latter '60s altho more upscale.  We were upper middle-class hippies who'd gone to high school together & lived not all that far from the nice homes we grew-up in.  While there was ALL the sex/drugs & rock 'n' roll you've ever heard...someone always rented a house/had a car & there was always food & beds to sleep in especially if you were a girl.  No one pan-handled in Los Gatos CA...it would've been inappropriate even then (the future home of Netflix).  Except if you'd asked my mom...I was living in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco selling my young body on the street for hard drugs.  The parents over-reactions here are so true to form...what were they so afraid of?,1500422400,,773,4.613138686131387
